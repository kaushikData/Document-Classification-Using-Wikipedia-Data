The '''Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative''' (AFCI) is an extensive research and development effort of the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE). The mission and focus of AFCI is to enable the safe, secure, economic and sustainable expansion of nuclear energy by conducting research, development, and demonstration focused on nuclear fuel recycling and waste management to meet U.S. needs.

The program was absorbed into the GNEP project, which was renamed [[IFNEC]].

==Focus==
[[File:AFCI Challenges.jpg|thumb|AFCI challenges]]
* Continue critical fuel cycle research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) activities 
* Pursue development of policy and regulatory framework to support fuel cycle closure 
* Determine and develop RD&amp;D infrastructure needed to mature technologies 
* Establish advanced modeling and simulation program element 
* Implement a science-based RD&amp;D program

==Campaigns==
[[File:AFCI Programs.jpg|thumb|DOE national laboratories that support AFCI programs]]
The AFCI is an extensive RD&amp;D effort to close the fuel cycle. The different areas within the AFCI are separated into campaigns. The RD&amp;D of each campaign is completed by the [[United States Department of Energy]]'s national laboratories.

* Transmutation fuels
* Fast reactor development
* Separations
* Waste forms
* Grid Appropriate Reactor Campaign
* Safeguards
* Systems analysis
* Modeling and simulation 
* Safety and regulatory

=== Transmutation fuels ===

The mission of the Transmutation Fuels Campaign is the generation of data, methods and models for fast reactor transmutation fuels and targets qualification by performing RD&amp;D activities on fuel fabrication and performance. The campaign is led by [[Idaho National Laboratory]].

=== Reactor development ===

The mission of the Reactor Campaign is to develop advanced recycling reactor technologies required for commercial deployment in a closed nuclear fuel cycle. The Reactor Campaign is led at [[Argonne National Laboratory]].

=== Separations ===

The mission of the Separations Campaign is to develop and demonstrate industrially deployable and economically feasible technologies for the recycling of used nuclear fuel to provide improved safety, security and optimized waste management. The campaign is led by Idaho National Laboratory.

=== Waste forms ===

The mission of the Waste Forms Campaign is to develop and demonstrate durable waste forms and processes to enable safe and cost-effective waste management as an integral part of a closed nuclear fuel cycle by establishing a fundamental understanding of behavior through closely coupled theory, experiment and modeling. This campaign is led at Argonne National Laboratory.

=== Grid Appropriate Reactor Campaign ===

The mission of the Grid Appropriate Reactor Campaign is to enable U.S. leadership in the global expansion of nuclear energy by conducting research, development, and demonstration of technologies and innovative reactor designs that offer enhanced safety, security, and proliferation resistance and that are appropriately sized for infrastructure-limited countries.

=== Safeguards ===

The mission of the Safeguards Campaign is to ensure that domestic fuel cycle facilities fully meet requirements under regulatory frameworks; thereby assuring that nuclear materials have not been diverted or misused. The campaign is led at [[Sandia National Laboratories]].

=== Systems analysis ===

The mission of the Systems Analysis Campaign is to conduct systems-wide analyses of nuclear energy development and infrastructure deployment to enable a requirements-driven process for all technical activities, and to inform strategic planning and key program decisions. The campaign is led at Idaho National Laboratory.

=== Modeling and simulation ===

The mission of the Modeling and Simulation Campaign is to rapidly create, and deploy “science-based” verified and validated modeling and simulation capabilities essential for the design, implementation, and operation of future nuclear energy systems with the goal of improving future U.S. energy security. These AFCI activities are led at Argonne National Laboratory.

=== Safety and regulatory ===

The mission of the Safety and Regulatory Campaign is to ensure that regulatory and licensing requirements for future facilities and technologies are appropriately considered and incorporated during the course of technology development.

[[Image:Amiga_520_1.jpg|thumb|The Amiga 520 adapter allowed for [[RF modulator|RF modulated]] and [[composite video]] output, to be connected to a TV]]
The Commodore A520 [[RF modulator]] connects to the video port and outputs [[composite video]] and [[RF modulator|RF video]].

The '''Amiga video connector''' is used on all Commodore Amiga computers. The 23-pin [[D-subminiature]] has signals for [[genlock]]ing, [[RGB#RGB and displays|RGB]] [[analog video]] (4096 colours), and a digital Red-Green-Blue-Intensity signal (16 colours).

The refresh frequency is 15 or 30 [[Hertz|kHz]] [[Synchronization|HSync]] for standard Amiga video modes. This is not compatible with most [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] monitors but usually with most Televisions. A [[Multisync monitor]] is required for some higher resolutions.

== History ==
Andrews Space was founded in 1999 by Jason Andrews and Marian Joh to be a catalyst in the commercialization, exploration and development of space.  Originally named Andrews Space &amp; Technology, the company shortened its name in 2003 to Andrews Space.  Over its life the company developed many unique technologies and space transportation architectures for the US Government (NASA, DARPA, others) and commercial customers.  These include the Gryphon horizontal takeoff horizontal landing system using the "Alchemist" Air Collection and Enrichment System (ACES) as part of the NASA Space Launch Initiative.  The Peregrine small launch vehicle was developed as part of the DARPA FALCON program and used a reusable first stage with expendable solid motor upper stages&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  In 2003 Andrews Space was one of four companies selected by NASA to study commercial cargo logistics to the International Space Station&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.  This later lead to the NASA COTS (Commercial Orbital Transportation System) program to fly cargo to the ISS commercially.  Andrews Space was chosen in 2006 as one of six finalists for NASA's [[Commercial Orbital Transportation Services]] (COTS) program, though they were not subsequently selected for funding the COTS R&amp;D by NASA.&lt;ref name=nasa20120302&gt;
{{cite web |publisher=NASA |date=2012-03-02 |title=COTS 2006 Demo Competition |url=http://www.nasa.gov/offices/c3po/about/cots_demo_competition.html |accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Andrews Space later supported Rocketplane Kistler's COTS effort.  In 2010 and 2011 Andrews Space support Orbital's Cygnus COTS effort.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In November 2010, Andrews Space was selected by NASA for consideration for potential contract awards for [[heavy lift launch vehicle]] system concepts, and propulsion technologies.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Selects Companies for Heavy-Lift Vehicle Studies|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/nov/HQ_10-292_Heavy_Lift.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=8 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101108235904/http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/nov/HQ_10-292_Heavy_Lift.html| archivedate= 8 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 Andrews Space was one of four companies selected by the US Air Force as part of its Rocket-back Booster System demonstrator program.  As part of these awards the company was awarded a $250M IDIQ contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/awin/usaf-paves-way-reusable-booster-demonstrator|title=USAF Paves Way for Reusable Booster Demonstrator|last=|first=|date=|website=Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Andrews Space was [https://spacenews.com/us-army-taps-andrews-for-second-kestrel-eye-satellite/ awarded a contract by the US Army SMDC] to build the Kestrel Eye 2 small imaging spacecraft&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://spacenews.com/us-army-taps-andrews-for-second-kestrel-eye-satellite/|title=U.S. Army Taps Andrews for Second Kestrel Eye Satellite - SpaceNews.com|date=2013-02-01|work=SpaceNews.com|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  This was the result of a pivot by Andrews Space, begun in 2008, to move into space hardware production and very small spacecraft.  While the Kestrel Eye 2 program was delayed and ultimately cancelled due to funding cuts as a result of Sequestration, much of the technology would make it to orbit as part of the [[Blacksky Pathfinder-1|BlackSky Pathfinder]] spacecraft, which was launched successfully in September 2016.

From 2011-2013 Andrews Space [https://www.spaceflightindustries.com/2011/11/08/2012810andrews-space-delivers-cargo-module-power-unit-for-orbitals-cygnus-spacecraft/ developed and built the Cargo Module Power Unit] for Orbital's Cygnus cargo delivery spacecraft&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spaceflightindustries.com/2011/11/08/2012810andrews-space-delivers-cargo-module-power-unit-for-orbitals-cygnus-spacecraft/|title=Spaceflight Industries Delivers Cargo Module Power Unit for Orbital's Cygnus Spacecraft - Spaceflight Industries|date=2011-11-08|work=Spaceflight Industries|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The CMPU was responsible for supplying power and managing power distribution to powered experiments inside the Cygnus spacecraft during their trip to the ISS.  Andrews Space also licensed the magnetic torque rod design from Sinclair Interplanetary and produced many units which were used in a range of spacecraft, including those for the BlackSky Pathfinder / Global spacecraft, the Skybox Skysat spacecraft, as well as others&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spaceflight.com/spaceflight-industries-to-manufacture-sinclair-rods/|title=Spaceflight Industries to Manufacture Sinclair Rods - Spaceflight|date=2012-11-13|work=Spaceflight|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2015 Andrews Space was merged with [http://spaceflight.com/ Spacefight] Inc. and [https://www.blacksky.com/ BlackSky] Global LLC and operated as Spaceflight Systems, a separate operating entity under the parent company of [https://www.spaceflightindustries.com/ Spaceflight Industries].

The '''Ascom EasyTicket''' is a railway ticket issuing system used in Britain, consisting of a series of self-service (passenger-operated) machines at railway stations.  Having been introduced in 2003 on a trial basis by several [[List of companies operating trains in the United Kingdom|Train Operating Companies]] (TOCs) at various stations, the system did not spread into common usage, and most machines have since been removed.

==Company details==
Ascom AG was created in 1987 through a merger between three major telecommunications companies in Switzerland, although its origins can ultimately be traced back to the establishment of the Swiss Federal Telegraph Workshops in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ascom Equity Note - Brokerage Research document (see page 8) |url=http://www.ascom.com/sarasin_20050329.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202074324/http://www.ascom.com/sarasin_20050329.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The '''Autelca AG''' division, which had been acquired in 1963 by one of Ascom AG's constituent companies, was involved in the manufacture of ticket vending machines (TVMs); it provided [[British Rail]] with the [[Ascom B8050 Quickfare|B8050]] self-service machine, hundreds of which were installed at stations across Britain from 1989 onwards.

The EasyTicket system was developed while the Transport Revenue division, as it was then known, was still under Ascom's ownership; but as part of an attempt to focus on the telecommunications sector, the division was sold in August 2005 to [[Affiliated Computer Services]], Inc for 130 million Swiss Francs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACS Investor Relations: ACS to Acquire Ascom's Transport Revenue Division; Expands Transit, Parking, and Toll Solutions in Government Services Market |url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=99443&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=738865&amp;highlight= |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731093950/http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=99443&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=738865&amp;highlight= |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The company's first attempt to move on from the successful B8050 machine was the [[Avantix B8070|B8070]], a small evolutionary upgrade initially developed and delivered in 1999.  In the meantime, however, a more significant, revolutionary design solution was being sought: Ascom realised that the late-1980s B8050 technology was no longer suitable for the modern railway environment, given the increasing use of [[Payment card|credit and other payment cards]], the anticipated adoption of the [[Chip and PIN]] secure-payments system, new disability regulations and the effects [[Privatisation of British Rail|privatisation]] had on fragmenting and expanding the fare structure on Britain's railways.

The EasyTicket system (official code number TIS9000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ascom launches new-generation TVMs - Fare Collection (International Railway Journal, Feb 2004)|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQQ/is_2_44/ai_113853220 | work=International Railway Journal | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed with these considerations in mind, and features:
* Two different machine heights, with one having a specially lowered screen, coin/card slots and ticket dispenser suitable for wheelchair users
* Touch-screen technology with a series of sub-menus
* Instructions in six different languages, selectable at the start of the transaction process
* Cash-and-card and card-only models

==Installation programme==
Machines began to be installed on a trial basis in March 2003, with a single machine (low-height, cash-and-card version) at [[Gatwick Airport railway station|Gatwick Airport station]].  More followed, as shown: ''(Train Operating Company names are those current at the time of installation)''

Following the trial at Gatwick Airport, [[Gatwick Express]], the Train Operating Company responsible for providing ticketing facilities at Gatwick Airport and [[London Victoria station|London Victoria]], elected to install an additional five at the former and one at the latter.  There were previously six Ascom B8050 machines at Gatwick Airport, so this turned out to be a like-for-like replacement.  The machine at London Victoria is close to the Gatwick Express ticket office windows on the dedicated Express platforms; there were two B8050 machines there until around 1991.

'''Beard oil''' is a [[Cosmetic products|cosmetic product]] that is used to nourish the [[Human skin|skin]] under the [[beard]], as well as the beard itself in order to keep it "soft, shiny, and smooth".&lt;ref&gt;"Best Beard Oils to Tame Your Beard." Mensjournal.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 01 Sept. 2014.
&lt;/ref&gt; Beard oil mimics the natural oils produced by skin, such as [[sebum]], and is composed mainly of carrier oils and essential oils.

==Ingredients==
Beard oil products are a blend of one or more ingredients, such as [[jojoba oil]], [[argan oil]], [[coconut oil]], [[grape seed oil]], [[hempseed oil]] that are used to address specific beard problems such as itching, sensitive skin or dryness by going straight to the follicle in a similar fashion to hair conditioner.

Beard oil is usually scented (though unscented versions are available) using a variety of natural and artificial, typically [[Masculinity|masculine]], scents ranging from sweet to bitter and can be used to substitute cologne or aftershave.

==Benefits==
Beard oil acts as a moisturizer that goes straight to the [[hair follicle]] and prevents hair from growing brittle, especially in cold, windy environments&lt;ref&gt;"Your Beard Needs Oil." Esquirecom Article. N.p., n.d. Web. 01 Sept. 2014.
&lt;/ref&gt; as these weather conditions cause the natural moisture of the beard area to wick. Hydration around this area helps prevent flaking, dandruff and skin dryness. Some brands of beard oil may contain added vitamins or nutrients such as vitamin E. This moisturization prevents general itchiness and irritation of the skin below the beard. 

Beard oil also works below the surface of the skin by working as a grooming tool, making the beard itself more manageable, neat and smooth.  

Beard oil also improves the way a beard looks by giving it a slight shine. This makes a beard look healthier as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dorit-sasson/4-ways-beard-oil-help-men_b_9542364.html|title=4 Reasons Men Should Be Using Beard Oil|last=Sasson|first=Dorit|date=March 25, 2016|website=Huffington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Beard oil can be applied daily and is generally put on the beard area after showering or cleansing in order to have the opened pores easily absorb the oil.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Dana. "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/01/beard-oil-facial-hair_n_5629592.html What The Heck Is Beard Oil, And How Does It Work?]" The Huffington Post. TheHuffingtonPost.com, 01 Aug. 2014. Web. 01 Sept. 2014.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical makeup and formulations==
Beard oils are manufactured with the intent to emulate the natural oils produced by the skin, known as [[sebum]]. Carrier type oils generally contain vitamins A, D and E, as well as a high concentration of [[linoleic acid]]s and low concentrations of [[oleic acid]]s. Natural and synthetic scents may be added to the oil in order to enhance its properties and aroma. Natural scents (essential oils, absolutes, and extracts) are derived differently than synthetic scents&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. O'Lenick, Jr., Siltech LLC; and Ed Matson, Carrubba Inc [http://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/formulating/function/fragrance/136099708.html "Comparatively Speaking: Natural vs. Synthetic Fragrance"] Dec 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and contain different chemical compounds that enhance their functionality. This can give beard oils properties such as antibacterial, deodorant, anti-inflammatory and anti-aging. Beard oils sold in the United States making claims to be therapeutic must be approved by the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;FDA.gov [http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Products/ucm127054.htm "FDA - Aromatherapy"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural beard oils are typically created with both carrier oils and [[essential oils]], absolutes, and/or extracts. Carrier oils are oils that make up the bulk of the volume of the product and are formulated to condition the skin and beard. The most popular types of carrier oils are coconut, grape seed, jojoba, saffron and argan. They are used as a natural fragrance for the beard oils, but also may have [[aromatherapy]] benefits. Since essential oils, absolutes, and extracts are usually very strong they may cause chemical burns or skin irritation, they are commonly paired up with carrier oils in order to dilute them.

==Popularity==
Awareness of beard oil and beard-grooming products has been increasing due to the fact that industries have become "more permissive" of facial hair.&lt;ref&gt;Boncompagni, Tatiana. [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/fashion/taming-of-the-beard.html?_r=0 "The Taming of the Beard."] The New York Times. The New York Times, 30 Jan. 2013. Web. 01 Sept. 2014.

[[Image:Constant fraction 1.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of threshold triggering (left) and constant fraction triggering (right)]] 

A '''constant fraction discriminator''' (CFD) is an electronic signal processing device, designed to mimic the mathematical operation of finding a [[Maxima and minima|maximum]] of a pulse by finding the zero of its [[slope]].
Some signals do not have a sharp maximum, but short rise times &lt;math&gt;t_r&lt;/math&gt;.

Typical input signals for CFDs are pulses from plastic [[scintillation counter]]s, such as those used for lifetime measurement in [[Electron-positron annihilation|positron annihilation]] experiments. The scintillator pulses have identical rise times that are much longer than the desired temporal resolution.  This forbids simple threshold triggering, which causes a dependence of the trigger time on the signal's peak height, an effect called ''time walk'' (see diagram). Identical rise times and peak shapes permit triggering not on a fixed threshold but on a ''constant fraction'' of the total peak height, yielding trigger times independent from peak heights.
==From another point of view==
[[File:Operation of a CFD.png|right|400px|Principle of operation of CFD]]
A [[time to digital converter]] assigns timestamps. The [[time to digital converter]] needs fast rising edges with normed height.
The plastic [[scintillation counter]] delivers fast rising edge with varying heights.
Theoretically, the signal could be split into two parts. One part would be delayed and the other low pass filtered, inverted and then used in a variable gain [[amplifier]] to amplify the original signal to the desired height. Practically, it is difficult to achieve a high dynamic range for the variable gain amplifier, and [[analog computer]]s have problems with the inverse value.

==Principle of operation==
The incoming signal is split into three components.
One component is delayed by a time &lt;math&gt;t_d&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;0\ll t_d\le t_r&lt;/math&gt;
- it may be multiplied by a small factor to put emphasis on the leading edge of the pulse -
and connected to the noninverting input of a [[comparator]].
One component is connected to the inverting input of this comparator.
One component is connected to the noninverting input of another comparator.
A threshold value is connected to the inverting input of the other comparator.
The output of both comparators is fed through an [[AND gate]].

Note from this description that a discriminator without that constant fraction would just be a comparator.
Therefore the word [[Foster-Seeley discriminator|discriminator]] is used for something different
(namely for an FM-[[demodulator]]).

Note also that often the [[Logic families|logic levels]] are shifted from -15 V &lt; low &lt;  0 &lt; high &lt; 15 V delivered by the comparator to 0 V &lt; low &lt; 1.5 V &lt; high &lt; 3.3 V needed by CMOS logic.

==Applications==
If the discriminator triggers a sampler with a following comparator this is called a single channel analyzer (SCA).
If an [[Analog-to-digital converter]] is used, this is called a multi channel analyzer (MCA).

'''da Vinci Systems''' was a [[digital cinema]] company founded in 1984, based in [[Coral Springs, Florida]] and wholly owned by [[JDSU]]'''.''' It was known for products like the '''888''', '''2K''' and '''2K Plus''' (hardware based color correctors), '''TLC''', '''Resolve''' (GPU-based color grading and digital mastering systems) and '''Revival''' (film restoration and remastering systems) and its innovations include the color control panel based on trackballs and other discrete controls that enable colorists to control the software that manipulates motion picture images.

As one of the earliest pioneers in post production products, da Vinci Systems introduced several innovative products and was considered a significant player in the post production industry during its 25 years of operation. da Vinci Systems equipment was initially developed by Video Tape Associates (VTA) in 1982 for use by the Hollywood, Florida, USA-based production/post production facility to alter and enhance colors from scanned film and video tape. The Wiz system, as it was later known, was marketed to other post production facilities, laying the foundation for the creation of the colorist and the post production color suite.

In September 2009, after the liquidation of the company, the assets of da Vinci Systems were acquired by [[Blackmagic Design]], an Australian digital cinema company and [[Manufacturing|manufacturer]] known for its products based in digital cinema and cameras.

==History==

* 1982 - Video Tape Associates (VTA) a Hollywood, Florida, USA based production/post production facility begins development of the Wiz for internal use.
* 1983 - Public introduction to The Wiz. The system controlled early telecines (RCA FR-35, Bosch FDL60) and offered basic primary and secondary color correction. The Editel group of post production facilities in the US evaluated the technology and asked that VTA build multiple systems for them. About 15 units were made and subsequently purchased by other post facilities across the US. The Wiz was essentially the prototype for what would become the da Vinci color corrector.
* 1984 - The da Vinci Classic analog grading system was released and became the most popular color corrector for the Fernseh FDL 60 and Rank Cintel telecines (Mark 3 and URSA). It had a customized external control panel with internal primary and secondary processing and also an internal NTSC encoder. The Classic operated on a Motorola 68000 Multi Bus 1 system computer. The program and color correction list were stored on a 20MB MMF hard disk, with backup to a 5.25" floppy disk.
* 1984 - VTA Technologies, the R&amp;D division of VTA Post, became da Vinci Systems, Inc. Development of the da Vinci color corrector continued. Other products added to the line included an editor, machine control system, and routing system. The da Vinci was the only film-to-tape or tape-to-tape color correction system on the market that offered the capability to create a basic rectangular window shape isolating a secondary color correction. As the da Vinci product line evolved, the original da Vinci became known as the da Vinci Classic.
* 1986 - Dynatech Video Group (Utah Scientific, ColorGraphics Systems, Quanta, among others) acquires da Vinci and it is managed within their Utah Scientific business.
* 1988 - da Vinci Systems LLC is spun off from Utah Scientific and becomes its own entity as one of roughly eight video manufacturing companies in the portfolio of the Dynatech Video Group. Later, in 2000, through corporate restructure and merger with WWG and TTC, Dynatech became Acterna.
* 1989 - da Vinci Renaissance was the analog system that followed the da Vinci Classic analog system. It was similar to the Classic but ran on a Motorola 68020 Multi Bus 1 system with a 3.5" floppy. Options like Kilovectors were later available for the analog Renaissance. Kilovectors secondary color processing, more advanced than what was offered on the Classic, would become an industry standard function of secondary color isolation.
* 1990 - Under direction from the parent company, da Vinci introduces a low cost color corrector for broadcasters and small post facilities. To reduce cost the stripped down telecine-only programmer, called Leonardo, used a flat plate (vision mixer style) control panel and provided only scene-by-scene control of a telecine (similar to Cintel's Amigo). Leonardo did not offer da Vinci color processing and was not successful in the market, with only one unit sold.
* 1991 - The da Vinci Renaissance 888 was introduced to the color grading marketing. Operating at first with the original control panel interface and no GUI, the 888 was the first product in the world to offer digital 8:8:8 signal processing throughout. New groundbreaking features like Power Windows, Custom Curves and YSFX were to become part of its successful feature set.
* 1992 - Power Windows were introduced to the Renaissance 888 permitting masking of grades.
* 1992 - In a significant development in addition to vector grading, Custom Curves were introduced to the Renaissance 888. 1994 - da Vinci Systems wholly acquired the TLC product line from Time Logic. The TLC is still viewed today as the de facto standard edit control interface between telecines, color correctors, VTRs and DDRs. TLC (Time Logic Controller) is an edit controller for telecines, vision mixers (switchers), and VTRs. It provides accurate 2:3 editing when transferring 24fps film in a 30fps video environment. TLC 1 was originally made in Moorpark, CA (started in Redondo Beach, then Simi Valley). The TLC 2 was released later that year under the da Vinci brand.
* 1995 - The 8:8:8 DUI (da Vinci User Interface) was introduced to the market. The DUI offered the same color processing as the Renaissance 8:8:8 but featured a new Windows style user interface, an SGI hosted operating system, a migration of the external TLC controller into the DUI, and EDWIN, an extension of the industry renowned Power Windows. The telecine interface card controlled the telecine's internal color corrector. The 888 DUI came in two configurations: the first was the DUI with an SGI Indy workstation; the second 888 DUI system used an SGI O2 workstation (affectionately called the Toaster). These systems also supported da Vinci's new control panels which became the industry standard. The panel layout and configuration is still in use today.

:During 1995 da Vinci also made the da Vinci Light. This was not marketed, so not many were sold. The da Vinci Light was a da Vinci DUI 888 without the digital 888 cards. The da Vinci DUI 888 had the electrical equivalent of the TLC2 designed on the IMC (along with Telecine Interface) boards. Software options to the DUI included the ability to edit, control VTRs, switchers, and use an EDL.

* 1996 - Dynatech sold most of the Dynatech Video Group but maintained the market leading da Vinci Systems.
* 1998 - Offering a significant technological breakthrough, da Vinci 2K, the company's first high definition and data color grading system for film and video, was released. It offered a huge boost in color processing quality and performance and included new features like PowerTiers, Defocus and Colorist Toolbox. These features, unmatched by any competitive product, become the standard that other companies attempted to emulate. Feature filmmakers began to use da Vinci 2K in the color grading finishing process, a process that would later become known as digital intermediate or DI.

:The 2K was designed to work for SD, HD, and Data and to have room for future upgrades. The base system has In/Out Primaries, Secondaries, New Power Windows and a new interface. Originally controlled by an SGI 02, it was later upgraded to Linux which provided easier support. The 2K was to have a newly designed machine control system also called TLC. Since this functionality was a bit late to completion, the ability to use the external TLC2 connected to the 2K provided some necessary breathing room. It was this configuration that required the A/B RS-422 switch box in the Tape to Tape configuration, allowing the TLC2 to synchronize the decks, while the 2K provided the necessary frame accurate color corrections.

* 1998 - da Vinci Academy was formed to provide training to the growing number of aspiring colorists.
* 1999 - The 2K add a new PowerTiers option permitting up to 8 channels, each with Power Windows, full Primary and Master Secondary control.
* 1999 - da Vinci acquired Sierra Design Labs, Incline Village, NV, at that time a worldwide leader in HDTV storage and workstation interface solutions. Using disk arrays before and after the 2K to provide nonlinear grading became a key goal in product development and the basis for many innovations in the years to come.
* 2000 - A Defocus option was added to the 2K, offering inside or outside defocus or sharpness effects (in and out with Defocus Plus) plus Power Windows, In/Out color, and matte defocus. The defocus was adjustable and included realtime Gaussian blur in HD making it the top quality realtime broadcast video defocus engine of its time. 2000 - da Vinci acquires Nirvana Digital of Singapore, creator of the Revival film restoration system, and incorporates the product into its line up. 2001 - PowerGrades are added to the 2K feature list.
* 2001 - The Gallery, an integrated reference store, was offered as another 2K feature with an optional Central Server and Palette paint program interface. The Windows interface converted stills between resolutions and exported them as jpg, tiff or bmp files. This later became standard on all 2K Plus systems.
* 2002 - 2K Plus was launched to support HDTV and SDTV, using an IBM PC computer running Red Hat Linux software. The 2K Plus was used on high-end DataCines and telecines, like Thomson-Grass Valley's Spirit DataCine and Cintel's C-Reality &amp; ITK Millennium. The 2K Plus operated with a 4:2:2, 4:4:4 or 8:4:4 input in NTSC or PAL. In HDTV it operated with either a 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 input. Redesigned Primaries, Secondaries and Keys made this more than just a 2K upgrade.
* 2002 - The TLC Assistant was offered to the market providing an external Linux terminal with keyboard and mouse for those facilities that needed permanent access to the editor. It was offered in single and dual user modes.
* 2002 - Colorist Toolbox option was released for the 2K Plus. A hardware upgrade for those who had outgrown the Defocus option, Colorist Toolbox added 4 PowerVectors, each with its own matte Defocus, Power Windows, In/Out Master Secondaries, Filter Effects and Textures. The Filters included the equivalent of a Defocus Plus board.
* 2003 - da Vinci Systems' parent company, Acterna, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection while reorganizing its business and emerged after just 5 months. da Vinci business was not affected and during this year while developing the concept of non linear grading from its Sierra Labs and 2K experience, the Resolve software color corrector has its first public showing.
* 2003 - Nucleas is launched, providing a server-to-server software interface to existing 2K Plus systems to work from data disks and storage networks. Both HiPPI and HSDL interfaces are offered and the system included data waveforms, CMS and data playback. While the Nucleas business did not reach expectations, computer systems continued to become faster, permitting a refocus of engineering into a completely new software grading system.
* 2004 - Resolve, a software-based, resolution-independent color grading system is launched. Resolve was developed specifically for the Digital Intermediate market and in its early years operated on conventional PC hardware with optimized performance via DaVinci's own custom designed PC based PowerPlant acceleration and Transformer image translation hardware.

:Resolve offers color enhancement at the core, but also features a highly advanced toolset including conforming, network file browsing, image resizing and formatting.

:da Vinci also created Nucleas Conform in 2004 which built a data timeline from an EDL, rendered dissolves and allowed switching between Source and Record order. The system was shown at NAB configured as server-to-server and server-to-video.

* 2005 - JDS Uniphase acquires the assets of Acterna including da Vinci Systems. 2005 - 2K Plus development continued and the Toolbox 2 option included improved user interface and filter presets. During the year 2K Plus configurations Emerald, Sapphire and Ruby were announced with elite logos for systems with Defocus, Toolbox and 4 PowerTiers (Emerald), 3 PowerTiers (Sapphire) or 2 PowerTiers (Ruby)
* 2006 - With ever-changing edit decisions in digital intermediate workflows, the ColorTrace option was offered for 2K Plus and Resolve to track color grades when the EDL is revised. 2006 - Splice is presented to the market as a server-to-server system enabling 2K systems to work from data disks and storage networks. Delays in delivery ultimately see the product dropped.
* 2008 - Impresario, a new control panel for Resolve, is launched at NAB 2008 and demonstrated at NAB 2009.
* 2009 - The assets of da Vinci Systems were purchased by Blackmagic Design and DaVinci Resolve (upper case D and no space) and Revival offered in September at IBC under the BMD brand with a commitment to significantly expand the R&amp;D resources and further develop Resolve.

==Product Details==

===The Wiz===

The Wiz was the predecessor to the da Vinci Classic color corrector and was built in 1982 by VTA Technologies in Ft. Lauderdale. It was built on an Apple computer, the program was stored in EPROM and the list could be backed up to mini cassettes. 
The Wiz was the first color correction system to have a customized external control panel and was also the first color corrector with internal primary and secondary processing. Prior to that, the primaries in the telecine were used. The Wiz had 10 vector patented secondary color correction. 
The first two systems were bought by Editel, Chicago, which at the time used the color corrector on Bosch [[Fernseh]]'s [[FDL60]] telecine.

===da Vinci Classic===

da Vinci Classic analog system was manufactured from 1985 to 1990 and had customized external control panel with internal primary, secondary processing and an internal NTSC encoder. It ran on a Motorola 68000 Multi Bus 1 system computer. The program and color correction list were stored on a 20MB MFM hard disk, with backup to a 5.25" floppy disk.

Its features include:
* Analog RGB(Y) path
* Primary and 16 vector secondaries
* Onboard 68000 CPU
* Small MFM hard drive
* Two control panels (power supplied from mainframe by resistive cable)
* Heavy linear PSU
* Flat pack chassis with PCB access from above

Options include:
* Hard edged simple XY window
* Onboard NTSC decoder
* NR control, prestore processing for MK3 Digi 4 (and some 3) telecines
* RGB(Y) and NTSC/PAL outputs. 525 or 625 or both
* B &amp; W menu monitor
Used with FDL60/90 and MK3 telecines (Not URSA) and tape-to-tape. Early models had knob only color correction controls; trackball control was introduced later.

===da Vinci Renaissance===

da Vinci Renaissance was the analog system that followed the Classic and was manufactured from 1990 to 1993. It was similar to the Classic but ran on Motorola 68020 Multi Bus 1 system with a 3.5" floppy.

Its features included:
* Improved channel and secondaries (later versions)
* Onboard 68000 CPU (early) or 68020 CPU (later)
* MFM Hard Drive
The early/budget 68000 models had two control panels and 16 vector secondaries, the same as the Classic. The later 68020 versions usually feature Kilovectors, advanced secondary correction and had three control panels.

Options included:
* Hard edged simple XY Window
* NR control
* Prestore processing for MK3 Digi 4 (and some 3) telecines
* RGB(Y) and NTSC/PAL outputs
* Heavy linear PSU

12v panels were used on early versions with 5v panels with separate PSU on later versions (not interchangeable with 12v panels). Both 525 and 625 standards were offered and a B&amp;W menu monitor was used. Often connected to a FDL60, FDL90, MK3 or URSA telecine, it was also used with videotape machines for tape-to-tape grading. Some versions used an extra interface module (the EMC unit) to function with the URSA serial control busses. Normally used with a separate TLC editor (1 or 2), an additional interface is required for this on URSA installations.

===da Vinci Renaissance 888===

da Vinci Renaissance 888 was similar to the above system, but had 888 digital video processing in place of the analog video processing. This system was manufactured from 1992–1998.

Its features included:
* 4:2:2, 4:4:4 or 8:4:4 input in NTSC or Pal
* 16 bit 8:8:8 (internally) 27&amp;nbsp;MHz sampling SD signal path
* Onboard 68020 CPU
* B&amp;W menu monitor - 525 or 625 or both. Character based display. No mouse.
* MFM HD, but IDE upgrade option sometimes fitted

Additional options for the digital 888 included:
* Power Windows (one only), a very powerful feature which enables area isolation with soft edges and various shapes.
* YSFX independently adjustable luminance and chrominance ratios which can be wound from full pos thru zero to neg.
* Custom Curves and a Key Input channel
* Used with FDL60, FDL90
* Quadra (reqs 4:4:4 option)
* MK3 types
* URSA telecines.

Early versions had a double backplane chassis (4:2:2 only) and used an extra interface module, the EMC, to function with URSA control busses. 888s were normally used with a separate TLC1 or 2 editors and an additional interface was required for this on URSA installations.

da Vinci also made the da Vinci Light. This was not marketed, so not many were sold. It is a da Vinci DUI 888 without the digital 888 cards. The telecine interface card controlled the telecine's internal color corrector. This came in two configurations: the first was the DUI with an SGI Indy workstation; the second DUI system used an SGI O2 workstation. These systems supported da Vinci's new control panels.

===da Vinci 2K and 2K Plus===

The da Vinci 2K Color Corrector, manufactured starting in 1998, was a completely revised color correction system that supported HDTV, SDTV, and 2K formats. The later system, the 2K Plus with improved color corrector tools was used on high-end DataCines and telecines like Thomson-Grass Valley's Spirit Datacine and Cintel's C-Reality &amp; ITK Millennium. The 2K operated with a 4:2:2, 4:4:4 or 8:4:4 input in NTSC or Pal. In HDTV it operated with either 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 inputs. Many were interfaced to the [[Spirit DataCine]].

Its features included:
* A software control system operating on the Red Hat Linux OS.
* Color grades of all combinations of SDTV 525/625, HDTV 1920x1080, 24P, 24SF, 720P in 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 and data. The optional data I/O accommodated, through HiPPi &amp; HSDL I/Os, various formats and speeds from lower resolutions through 2048x1556, depending on the I/O. When using the Data mode, an analog RGBHV monitoring output allowed viewing of the otherwise invisible Data signals.
* Operational features similar to DUI 888s, plus additional options including multiple Power Windows (up to nine), one or two areas of selective Defocus or Enhancement, and extended VSR capability with outboard Gallery reference storage computer which will store and retrieve irrespective of standard in use.
* Built in HD to SD downconverter in some systems. Later 2Ks have Plus processing which includes significant improvements to the signal processing circuitry. Older Non-Plus models were upgradable. The Control Panels are physically the same as late model DUIs with curved tops, but have numerous different keycaps.
* The control computer was either an SGI O2 with a custom SGI flat screen menu monitor (which requires special SGI Video Driver &amp; Card) or, in later model 2Ks, an IBM Linux Computer which uses an XVGA flat screen monitor.
* The O2 has a SD video input for VSRs but if a Linux OS computer was used a DaVinci Gallery was required to generate the VSR thumbnails.

2K and 2K Plus systems were intended for use with the then latest generation of telecines including Spirit, URSA or similar, C-Reality, Rascal, Sony and ITK telecines. MK3 / FDL / Quadra types were not supported. Many USA delivered 2Ks were supplied with an onboard TLC2 which supported 24/30 dual sync functionality for 24P operation. A TLC Assistant station comprising another IBM PC was available for dual operator installations. Alternatively, a standalone TLC2 of the traditional type could be interfaced if it was required.

In addition to telecine control, 2Ks were often used for tape-to-tape, virtual telecine and DDR applications.

===TLC===

The TLC was an edit controller for telecines and VTRs. It provided accurate 2/3 editing. TLC 1 was originally made in Moorpark, California, later TLC was acquired by da Vinci and the TLC 2 was released. The da Vinci DUI 888 had an option to have a built-in TLC built. If the TLC is not built in, an external A/B switch box is needed to switch control between the TLC and other Color Controllers. Some versions had a separate CPU and Telecine interface rack.

===Splice===

Promoted for use with non-linear storage/SAN sources and a 2K or 2K Plus, the da Vinci Splice was to provide data management to/from DPX files (up to 2048x1556) to SD/HD/HSDL with a built-in DVE for XYZ sizing, rotation etc., with subsequent color correction in the conventional fashion through the 2K. Built with Resolve’s Transformer II, Splice had Resolve’s basic conform and I/O features, but was promoted to extend the life and capabilities of a 2K. Very few were delivered.

===da Vinci Resolve===

Resolve, when launched in 2004, was a next-generation [[Color grading#Hardware-based_versus_software-based_systems|color grading system]] and the first system to use multiple parallel processing engines within normal PC computer infrastructure for real time 2K resolution color grading. Powered at launch by da Vinci’s proprietary hardware cards, known as PowerPlant cards, Resolve delivered real time HD and up to 4K resolution non-linear color grading.

Resolve was the first scalable color grading system offering multiple levels of acceleration, features and capabilities, providing colorists with exacting and intuitive color control over static or moving objects. Resolve scaled lower-resolution SD and DV formats to HD, 2K and 4K without compromising quality by using proprietary da Vinci engineered Transformer technology.

The first generation Resolve systems were called the Resolve RT and Resolve DI. In 2008, DaVinci offered the Resolve R series (R-100, R-200, R-250, R-300, R-350, R-4K, R-3D), replacing DaVinci’s proprietary parallel processing PowerPlant cards with parallel processing NVIDIA GPUs, enabling super-computing image processing and a significantly greater feature set.

Resolve features offered by da Vinci Systems included:
* Resolution independent 4K, 2K, HD and SD interactive color grading in real time.
* Non-linear color grading for quick matching and adjustment of similar scenes, regardless of where they occurred in the program.
* PowerMastering: Multiple resolution deliverables from a single master enabled grades in up to 2K resolution using the R-series R-200 to 350 and in 4K on the R-4K and output to 4K, 2K HD, SD 16:9, SD 4:3 and other media formats in real time without the need to pre-render the images.
* Direct connection to SANs and leading storage systems.
* Unlimited windows, layers and blurs that allowed complex color grading enhancements and fixes in real time.
* Real-time rotation and sizing to preserve the best possible image quality at any resolution.
* Parallel and series node-based grading that provided the maximum flexibility to apply complex grades to a scene.
* Combination of 4K, 2K, HD, SD and DV footage in the same timeline and utilization of the proprietary Transformer technology to resize for a consistent look and output to the desired size and resolution.
* Multi-point object tracking that allowed users to lock color decisions on moving objects within the scene.
* Laying off to tape in C-mode with graded handles and source time code that enabled effective interface with another finishing suite.
* Color grade of RED Raw files in real time
* Easy match of scene-to-scene shots
* Real time pan/tilt/zoom and rotate
* Instant access to all shots
* Grading in context in real time
* ColorTrace grading management software to support the enhanced list management features of changing edits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2526">'''Deep-sub-voltage nanoelectronics''' are integrated circuits (ICs) operating near theoretical limits of energy consumption per unit of processing.  These devices are intended to address the needs of applications such as [[wireless sensor networks]] which have dramatically different requirements from traditional electronics.  For example, for microprocessors where performance is primary metric of interest, but for some new devices, energy per instruction may be a more sensible metric.

The important case of fundamental ultimate limit for logic operation is the [[reversible computing]].

The tiny autonomous devices (for example [[smartdust]] or autonomous [[Microelectromechanical systems]]) are based on deep-sub-voltage nanoelectronics.

'''DigitalGlobe''' is an American commercial vendor of space imagery and geospatial content, and operator of civilian [[remote sensing]] spacecraft. The company [[Initial Public Offering|went public]] on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] on 14 May 2009, selling 14.7 million shares at $19.00 each to raise $279 million in capital. On 5 October 2017, [[Maxar Technologies]] has completed its acquisition of DigitalGlobe.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geospatialworld.net/news/mda-dg-combined-entity-to-be-rebranded-as-maxar-technologies/|title=MDA-DG combined entity to be rebranded as Maxar Technologies|work=Geospatial World|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WorldView satellites should not be confused with WorldView company, a division of [[Paragon Space Development Corporation]] offering flights to near-space.

==Origins==
WorldView Imaging Corporation was founded in January 1992 in [[Oakland, California]] in anticipation of the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act (enacted in October 1992) which permitted private companies to enter the satellite imaging business.&lt;ref name="eomonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Duman |first=Angie |url=http://www.eomonline.com/Common/Archives/1995oct/95oct_tripp.html |title=xyHt &amp;#124; Positioning and Measurement, Elevated |website=Eomonline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013192646/http://www.eomonline.com/Common/Archives/1995oct/95oct_tripp.html |archivedate=2008-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its founder was Dr Walter Scott, who was joined by co-founder and CEO Doug Gerull in late 1992. In 1993, the company received the first high [[Optical resolution|resolution]] commercial remote sensing satellite license issued under the 1992 Act.&lt;ref name="digitalglobehistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalglobe.com/about-us/company#history |title=Our Company |publisher=DigitalGlobe |date=2014-08-21 |accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was initially funded with private financing from [[Silicon Valley]] sources and interested corporations in N. America, Europe, and Japan.  Dr. Scott was head of the [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratories]] "Brilliant Pebbles" and "Brilliant Eyes" projects which were part of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]].  Doug Gerull was the executive in charge of the Mapping Sciences division at the [[Intergraph Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Markoff |first=John |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4D71638F931A25751C0A965958260 |title=COMPANY NEWS - A Plan for Close-Up Images of Earth From Space - NYTimes.com |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1993-02-12 |accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company's first remote sensing license from the [[United States Department of Commerce]] allowed it to build a commercial remote sensing [[Earth observation satellite|satellite]] capable of collecting images with {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} resolution.&lt;ref name="eomonline.com"/&gt;

In 1995, the company became EarthWatch Incorporated, merging WorldView with [[Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp.]]'s commercial remote sensing operations.&lt;ref name="companyhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalglobe.com/about/history.shtml |title=Digital Globe - History |accessdate=2006-04-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060413043028/http://digitalglobe.com/about/history.shtml |archivedate=2006-04-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2001, EarthWatch became DigitalGlobe.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asd.ssc.nasa.gov/datapurchase/default.aspx?s=6&amp;ss=2 |publisher=NASA |title=Scientific Data Purchase |accessdate=2006-04-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929025643/http://www.asd.ssc.nasa.gov/datapurchase/default.aspx?s=6&amp;ss=2 |archivedate=2006-09-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, DigitalGlobe acquired online imagery provider [[GlobeXplorer]] to extend its imagery distribution capabilities via online APIs and web services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SpaceNews » |url=http://spacenews.com/digitalglobe-buys-web-based-imagery-firm/ |title=Media |publisher=SpaceNews |date= |accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, DigitalGlobe was inducted into the [[Space Foundation]]'s [[Space Technology Hall of Fame]] for its role in advancing commercial Earth-imaging satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Space Foundation RSS Feed » |url=http://www.spacefoundation.org/news/story.php?id=1086 |title=Media |publisher=Space Foundation |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004121908/http://www.spacefoundation.org/news/story.php?id=1086 |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, DigitalGlobe purchased GeoEye.

==Satellites==

===EarlyBird-1===
EarlyBird-1 was launched for [[Earth Watch Inc.]] on December 24, 1997, from the [[Svobodny Cosmodrome]] by a [[Start-1]] launch vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1997-085A |title=Early Bird 1 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included a [[panchromatic]] camera with a {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} resolution and a [[multispectral]] camera with a {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}} resolution. Early Bird 1 was the first commercial satellite to be launched from the Svobodny Cosmodrome.

===IKONOS===
{{Main article|IKONOS}}
IKONOS was launched September 24, 1999. It was the world's first high-resolution commercial imaging satellite to collect panchromatic (black-and-white) images with 0.8 m resolution and multispectral (color) imagery with 3.2-meter resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dg-cms-uploads-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/document/file/96/DG_IKONOS_DS.pdf |title=IKONOS Data Sheet |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2016 |website=Dg-cms-uploads.production.s3.amazonaws.com |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31, 2015, IKONOS was officially decommissioned after more than doubling her mission design life, spending 5,680 days in orbit and making 83,131 trips around the earth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.tomnod.com/ikonos-quickbird-2/ |title=DigitalGlobe satellites IKONOS and QuickBird-2 retire after years of service |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2016 |website=Blog.tomnod.com |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064739/http://blog.tomnod.com/ikonos-quickbird-2/ |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===QuickBird===
{{Main article|QuickBird}}
QuickBird, launched on October 18, 2001,&lt;ref name="companyhistory" /&gt; was DigitalGlobe's primary satellite until early 2015. It was built by Ball Aerospace, and launched by a Boeing Delta II. It is in a 450&amp;nbsp;km altitude, −98 degree inclination [[sun-synchronous orbit]]. An earlier launch attempt resulted in the loss of QuickBird-1. It included a panchromatic camera with a {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}} resolution and a multispectral camera with a {{convert|2.4|m|abbr=on}} resolution. On January 27, 2015, QuickBird was de-orbited, exceeding her initial life expectancy by nearly 300%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===GeoEye-1===
{{Main article|GeoEye-1}}
The GeoEye-1 satellite collects images at .41-meter panchromatic (black-and-white) and 1.65-meter multispectral resolution. The satellite can collect up to 350,000 square kilometers of pan-sharpened multispectral imagery per day. This is used for large-scale mapping projects. GeoEye-1 can revisit any point on Earth once every three days or sooner.

{{No references|date=March 2015}}'''Econnect''' is a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[non-profit organisation]]. It works to "help other non-profit organisations from the [[Czech Republic]] to use [[electronic communication systems]]  and to have easy access to [[information technology]]." Founded in 1991, it came about because of the need for [[communication]] between diverse [[ecological]] action groups that were networked around the [[Green Circle]] umbrella organisation.

According to the group itself, its name "Econnect" comes from an [[abbreviation]] of "easy connection", which reflects its goal of providing smooth communications between action groups.

Econnect's goal has been to cover all parts of the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]. It created a network of 10 organisations, based in the big towns. These networking organisations were seen to be among the prominent players of the ecological movement at the time.

[[Internet]] and [[e-mail]] access was provided to Econnect since 1991, when the Internet was yet to be accepted as a major tool of communication in the country.

Econnect is a source of information from the [[non-profit sector]]. In 1991, Econnect became part of the alternate internet service providers, the [[Association for Progressive Communications]].

Its current services include connections to the [[Internet]], building a web presence for the [[non-profit]] world, [[technical support]], conference services, training, and drawing more visitors via the Internet to alternative groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2269">'''Embedded C''' is a set of language extensions for the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] by the [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22|C Standards Committee]] to address commonality issues that exist between C extensions for different [[embedded system]]s.  

Historically, embedded C programming requires nonstandard extensions to the C language in order to support exotic features such as [[fixed-point arithmetic]], multiple distinct [[memory bank]]s, and basic [[input/output|I/O]] operations.
In 2008, the C Standards Committee extended the C language to address these issues by providing a common standard for all implementations to adhere to. It includes a number of features not available in normal C, such as fixed-point arithmetic, named address spaces and basic I/O hardware addressing.
Embedded C uses most of the syntax and semantics of standard C, e.g., main() function, variable definition, datatype declaration, conditional statements (if, switch case), loops (while, for), functions, arrays and strings, structures and union, bit operations, macros, etc. &lt;ref&gt;(in Swedish) Jan Skansholm, "Vägen till C" ("The road to C"), Swedish {{ISBN|91-44-01468-6}}, p 237-774. Includes a good example of C-embedded programming, covering this article and far more. Like limits, what has to be done in machine language.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10111">'''Eugene Podkletnov''' ({{lang-ru|Евгений Подклетнов}}, Yevgeny Podkletnov) is a [[Rossiyane|Russian]] [[Ceramic engineering|ceramics engineer]] known for his claims made in the 1990s of designing and demonstrating [[gravity shielding]] devices consisting of rotating discs constructed from [[High-temperature superconductivity|ceramic superconducting]] materials.

==Background and education==
Podkletnov  graduated from the [[Mendeleev Russian University of Chemistry and Technology|University of Chemical Technology, Mendeleyev Institute]], in [[Moscow]]; he then spent 15 years at the Institute for High Temperatures in the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. He received a doctorate in materials science from [[Tampere University of Technology]] in [[Finland]]. After graduation he continued [[superconductor]] research at the university, in the [[Materials science|Materials Science]] department, until his expulsion in 1997. After which he moved back to Moscow where it is reported that he took an engineering job. Since leaving Tampere in 1997 Podkletnov has avoided public contact or appearances.&lt;ref name=Platt1998 /&gt; There is a report that he later returned to Tampere to work on superconductors at Tamglass Engineering Oy.&lt;ref name="Painovoimaa" /&gt;

==Gravity shielding==
According to the account Podkletnov gave to [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] reporter [[Charles Platt (author)|Charles Platt]] in a 1996 phone interview, during a 1992 experiment with a rotating superconducting disc:
 
:"Someone in the laboratory was smoking a pipe, and the pipe smoke rose in a column above the superconducting disc. So we placed a ball-shaped magnet above the disc, attached to a balance. The balance behaved strangely. We substituted a nonmagnetic material, silicon, and still the balance was very strange. We found that any object above the disc lost some of its weight, and we found that if we rotated the disc, the effect was increased."&lt;ref name=Platt1998&gt;{{cite news|last=Platt|first=Charles|title=Breaking the Law of Gravity|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.03/antigravity_pr.html|accessdate=2011-06-19|newspaper=Wired|date=June 3, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public controversy===
Podkletnov's first peer-reviewed paper on the apparent gravity-modification effect, published in 1992, attracted little notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Podkletnov|first1=E|last2=Nieminen|first2=R |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092145349290055H |title=A possibility of gravitational force shielding by bulk YBa2Cu3O7−x superconductor|journal=[[Physica C]] |volume=203|issue=3–4|date=December 10, 1992|pages=441–444|accessdate=April 29, 2014|bibcode = 1992PhyC..203..441P |doi = 10.1016/0921-4534(92)90055-H }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, he submitted a longer paper, in which he claimed to have observed a larger effect (2% weight reduction as opposed to 0.3% in the 1992 paper) to the ''[[Journal of Physics D]]''.&lt;ref name="withdrawn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="withdrawn2"&gt;{{cite arxiv|first=Evgeny|last=Podkletnov|eprint=cond-mat/9701074|title=Weak gravitation shielding properties of composite bulk Y Ba2Cu3O7−x superconductor below 70 K under e.m. field|date=September 16, 1997}} This is believed to be substantially the same paper accepted for publication in 1996 by Journal of Physics D which was later withdrawn by the author.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Platt, a member of the editorial staff, Ian Sample, leaked the submitted paper to Robert Matthews, the science correspondent for the British newspaper, the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref name=Platt1998 /&gt;

On September 1, 1996, Matthews's story broke, leading with the startling statement: "Scientists in Finland are about to reveal details of the world's first antigravity device."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1996/09/01/ngrav01.html |title=Scientists in Finland are about to reveal details of the world's first antigravity device |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |first=Graeme |last=Archer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314023910/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1996%2F09%2F01%2Fngrav01.html |archivedate=March 14, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing furor, the director of the laboratory where Podkletnov was working issued a defensive statement that Podkletnov was working entirely on his own. Vuorinen, listed as the paper's coauthor, disavowed prior knowledge of the paper and claimed that the name was used without consent. Podkletnov himself complained that he had never claimed to block gravity, only to have reduced its effect.&lt;ref name=Platt1998 /&gt;

Podkletnov withdrew his second paper after it had been initially accepted.&lt;ref name="withdrawn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bp0.blogger.com/_X2tcLFEJnwU/RavF9AEHkZI/AAAAAAAAAAM/ZQ7DaXG1P04/s1600-h/podkletnov.jpg |first1=E.E.|last1=Podkletnov |first2=P.T.|last2=Vuorinen|title=Gravitation shielding properties of composite bulk Y Ba2Cu3O7−x superconductor below 70 K under electromatic field|date=May 13, 1996|publisher=Journal of Applied Physics D|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="withdrawn2" /&gt; The resulting furor over the alleged claims in the withdrawn paper is reported to be the primary reason for his expulsion from his lab and the termination of his employment at the university.&lt;ref name=Platt1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Painovoimaa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ylioppilaslehti.fi/1998/04/24/painovoimaa-kumoamassa/ylioppilaslehti.fi/1998/04/24/painovoimaa-kumoamassa/ |title=Painovoimaa kumoamassa|author=Vuotta Sitten|date=April 24, 1998|language=Finnish|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted verification===
In a 1997 telephone interview with Charles Platt, Podkletnov insisted that his gravity-shielding work was reproduced by researchers at universities in [[Toronto]] and [[Sheffield]], but none have come forward to acknowledge this. The Sheffield work is known to have only been intended as partial replication, aimed at observing any unusual effects which might be present, since the team involved lacked the necessary facilities to construct a large enough disc and the ability to duplicate the means by which the original disc was rotated. Podkletnov counters that the researchers in question have kept quiet "lest they be criticized by the mainstream [[scientific community]]".&lt;ref name=Platt1998/&gt; Podkletnov is reported to have visited the Sheffield team in 2000 and advised them on the conditions necessary to achieve his effect, conditions that they never achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/2001/PV2001_3363.pdf|title=Gravity Modification by High Temperature Superconductors|authors=Woods, Cooke, Helm &amp; Caldwell|publisher=[[AIAA]]|year=2001}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a BBC news item, it was alleged that researchers at [[Boeing]] were funding a project called GRASP (Gravity Research for Advanced Space Propulsion) which would attempt to construct a gravity shielding device based on rotating superconductors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2157975.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Boeing tries to defy gravity | date=July 7, 2002| accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a subsequent ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' news item stated that Boeing had denied funding GRASP with company money, although Boeing acknowledged that it could not comment on "black projects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/1282281.html?page=3| title=Science Does The Impossible: February 2003 Cover Story| publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]]| year=2003| accessdate=April 29, 2014| deadurl=bot: unknown| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070930015205/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/1282281.html?page=3| archivedate=September 30, 2007| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is alleged that the GRASP proposal was presented to Boeing and Boeing chose not to fund it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelivingmoon.com/41pegasus/02documents/Project_Grasp.html|title=Gravity Shielding Still Science Fiction, Boeing Says|date=July 31, 2002|work=Space.com|first=Jim|last=Banke|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gravity beam==
Also during the 1997 telephone interview with Platt, Podkletnov said that he was continuing to work on gravitation, claiming that with new collaborators at an unnamed "chemical research center" in Moscow he has built a new device.  He said:

:"Normally there are two spheres, and a spark jumps between them. Now imagine the spheres are flat surfaces, superconductors, one of them a coil or O-ring. Under specific conditions, applying resonating fields and composite superconducting coatings, we can organize the energy discharge in such a way that it goes through the center of the electrode, accompanied by gravitation phenomena - reflecting gravitational waves that spread through the walls and hit objects on the floors below, knocking them over...The second generation of flying machines will reflect gravity waves and will be small, light, and fast, like UFOs. I have achieved impulse reflection; now the task is to make it work continuously."&lt;ref name=Platt1998 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5288">[[File:Four slide2.png|thumb|A four-slide machine]]
[[File:Four slide1.png|thumb|The same four-slide machine from another angle]]

A '''four-slide''', also known as a '''multislide''', '''multi-slide''', or '''four-way''', is a [[metalworking]] [[machine tool]] used in the high-volume manufacture of small [[stamping (metalworking)|stamped]] components from [[bar stock|bar]] or [[wire]] stock. The press is most simply described as a horizontal stamping press that uses cams to control tools.&lt;ref name="lascoe63"&gt;{{harvnb|Lascoe|1988|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The machine is used for [[progressive stamping|progressive]] or [[transfer stamping|transfer]] stamping operations.&lt;ref name="lascoe64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="degarmo"&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|pp=450–451}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
A four-slide is quite different from most other [[machine press|presses]]. The key of the machine is its moving slides that have tools attached, which strike the workpiece together or in sequence to form it. These slides are driven by four shafts that outline the machine. The shafts are connected by [[bevel gear]]s so that one shaft is driven by an [[electric motor]], and then that shaft's motion drives the other three shafts. Each shaft then has [[cam]]s which drive the slides, usually of a [[split-type cam|split-type]]. This shafting arrangement allows the workpiece to be worked for four sides, which makes this machine extremely versatile. A hole near the center of the machine is provided to expel the completed workpiece.&lt;ref name="lascoe63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lascoe64"&gt;{{harvnb|Lascoe|1988|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The greatest advantage of the four-slide machine is its ability to complete all of the operations required to form the workpiece from start to finish.&lt;ref name=what&gt;[http://www.engineering.com/AdvancedManufacturing/ArticleID/10442/What-Fourslide-Metal-Forming-Does-that-Power-Press-Cant.aspx "What Fourslide Metal Forming Does that Power Press Can’t"], July 21, 2015 , Engineering.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it can handle certain parts that [[transfer die|transfer]] or [[progressive die]]s cannot, because it can manipulate from four axes. Due to this flexibility it reduces the cost of the finished part because it requires less machines, [[setup (manufacturing)|setup]]s, and handling. Also, because only one machine is required, less space is required for any given workpiece. As compared to standard stamping presses the tooling is usually inexpensive, due to the simplicity of the tools. A four-slide can usually produce 20,000 to 70,000 finished parts per 16-hour shift, depending on the number of operations per part; this speed usually results in a lower cost per part.&lt;ref name="lascoe64"/&gt;

The biggest disadvantage is its size constraints. The largest machines can handle stock up to {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide, {{convert|12.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} long, and {{convert|3/32|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick. For wires the limit is {{convert|1/8|in|mm|abbr=on|3}}.&lt;ref name="degarmo"/&gt; Other limits are the travel on the slides, which maxes out at {{convert|3/4|in|mm|abbr=on|2}}, and the throw of the forming cams, which is between {{convert|7/8|and|2|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The machine is also limited to only [[shearing (metalworking)|shearing]] and [[bending (metalworking)|bending]] operations. [[Extrusion]] and [[upsetting]] operations are impractical because it hinders the movement of the workpiece to the next station. [[Drawing (metalworking)|Drawing]] and [[stretching (metalworking)|stretching]] require too much tonnage and the mechanisms required for the operations are space prohibitive. Finally, this machine is only feasible to use on high volume parts because of the long lead time required to set up the tooling.&lt;ref name="lascoe64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lascoe65"&gt;{{harvnb|Lascoe|1988|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
The material stock used in four-slides is usually limited by its [[formability]] and not the machine capabilities. Usually the forming characteristics and bending radii are the most limiting factors. The most commonly used materials are:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lascoe|1988|p=68}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''frequency meter''' is an instrument that displays the [[frequency]] of a [[Period (physics)|periodic]]  [[electrical signal]].

Various types of frequency meters are used. Many are instruments of the [[deflection (physics)|deflection]] type, ordinarily used for measuring low frequencies but capable of being used for frequencies as high as 900&amp;nbsp;Hz. These operate by balancing two opposing forces. Changes in the frequency to be measured cause a change in this balance that can be measured by the deflection of a pointer on a scale. Deflection-type meters are of two types, electrically [[LC circuit|resonant circuits]] and ratiometers.

An example of a simple electrically resonant circuit is a [[Ammeter#Moving-coil|moving-coil meter]]. In one version, this device has two coils tuned to different frequencies and connected at right angles to one another in such a way that the whole element, with attached pointer, can move. Frequencies in the middle of the meter’s range cause the currents in the two coils to be approximately equal and the pointer to indicate the midpoint of a scale. Changes in frequency cause an imbalance in the currents in the two coils, causing them, and the pointer, to move.

Another type of frequency meter, Weston Frequency meter is not of the deflection type, is the [[Resonance|resonant]] reed type, ordinarily used in ranges from 10 to 1,000&amp;nbsp;Hz, although special designs can operate at lower or higher frequencies.

The main principle of working of weston type frequency meter is that "when an current flows through the two coils which are perpendicular to each other, due to these currents some magnetic fields will produce and thus the magnetic needle will deflects towards the stronger magnetic field showing the measurement of frequency on the meter". Construction of weston frequency is as compared to ferrodynamic type of frequency meter. In order to construct a circuit diagram we need two coils, three inductors and two resistors.

Axis of both coils are marked as shown. Scale of the meter is calibrated such that at standard frequency the pointer will take position at 45o. Coil 1 contains a series resistor marked R1 and reactance coil marked as L1, while the coil 2 has a series reactance coil marked as L2 and parallel resistor marked as R2. The indcuctor which is marked as L0 is connected in series with the supply voltage in order to reduce the higher harmonic means here this inductor is working as a filter circuit. Let us look at the working of this meter.

Now when we apply voltage at standard frequency then the pointer will take normal position, if there increase the frequency of the applied voltage then we will see that the pointer will moves towards left marked as higher side as shown in the circuit diagram. Again we reduce the frequency the pointer will start moving towards the right side, if lower the frequency below the normal frequency then it cross the normal position to move towards left side marked lower side as shown in the figure.

Now let us look at the internal working of this meter. Voltage drop across an inductor is directly proportion to frequency of the source voltage, as we increase the frequency of the applied voltage the voltage drop across the inductor L1 increase that means the voltage impressed between the coil 1 is increased hence the current through the coil 1 increase while the current through the coil 2 decreases.
Since the current through the coil 1 increases the magnetic field also increases and the magnetic needle attracts more towards the left side showing the increment in the frequency. Similar action will takes if decrease the frequency but in this the pointer will moves towards the left side. 

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richardsradios.co.uk/freqmeter.html richardsradios.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; These work by means of tuned steel reeds that vibrate like a [[tuning fork]], under the effect of electric current through a coil; only those reeds that are in resonance vibrate visibly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/219641/frequency-meter britannica.com]

The non-profit was created in 2000 by [[Ethan Zuckerman]] and Elisa Korentayer in [[North Adams, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/featured_articles/001019thursday.html|title=A Techie Volunteer Corps|website=www.nytimes.com|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001 Geekcorps became a division of the [[International Executive Service Corps]] located in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfdCaZshLZMC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=Geekcorps&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi61bqBmZnUAhUDJiYKHVSMD0QQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Geekcorps&amp;f=false|title=The Role of Information and Communication Technologies in Global Development: Analyses and Policy Recommendations|last=Haqqani|first=Abdul Basit|date=2005|publisher=United Nations Publications|isbn=9789211045321|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation ==
After a visit to a Ghana library by Zuckerman in 1993, the lack of up-to-date resources available prompted him to create Geekcorps years later.  Humanitarian and banker Elisa Korentayer became co-founder of Geekcorps due to the organization's need of financial wisdom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In effort to increase access to current information and bridge the [[digital divide]] in developing nations Zuckerman, and associates from his now bought out internet company [[Tripod.com|tripod]], funded most of the $350,000 budget for Geekcorps' first year.

== Major projects ==

=== Ghana ===
Starting September 2000, with 6 volunteers selected from over 200 applicants, Geekcorps first mission was in [[Accra|Accra, Ghana]].  Co-founder Zuckerman was already familiar with the infrastructure of Ghana.  Zuckerman stated, "The government has relatively liberal telecommunications and investment policies, making it possible for IT businesses to be built there."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Geekcorps initial focus in Ghana was assisting Accran companies with its [[Information technology|IT]] expertise.  Geekcorps had an understanding with local businesses, after receiving help, the businesses involved were to help the locals with their newfound resources.  Initial challenges for Geekcorps were communication and teaching skills needed by volunteers, and reliance on outdated programming languages for local businesses.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CjkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Geekcorps&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi61bqBmZnUAhUDJiYKHVSMD0QQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=iesc&amp;f=false|title=InfoWorld|last=Inc|first=InfoWorld Media Group|date=2001-07-23|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geekcorps involvement lead to innovations such as a new java based payment system for local businesses in Ghana.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Geekcorps was also instrumental in the creation of Ghana's internet exchange in 2005.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/geekcorps-a-peace-corps-for-techies/|title=Geekcorps: A Peace Corps for techies|work=CNET|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mali ===
Initial assistance in [[Mali]] came from the CMRT (Community Mobilization through Radio Technology) program sponsored by [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]. Under CMRT, Geekcorps installed 5 radio stations to enable local communication through the area. Later under another program Radio for Peace Building, Geekcorps installed another 11 stations, and renovations were done to older existing stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iesc.org/geekcorps|title=ICT &amp; Applied Technologies|last=|first=|date=|website=IESC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geekcorps set up [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] stations in less populated areas of Mali in 2006. These stations were updated by a memory stick delivered from a computer center with internet access in [[Ouelessebougou]]. Although this allowed many rural locations access to specific web resources, such as web pages and digital media, due to lack of interest the program was modified after a year. Yearly updates to more desired information such as Moulin, a French version of Wikipedia, became the focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencealert.com/opinions/20092402-18834.html|title=Rural Internet Goes by Road|last=Nightingale|first=Katherine|work=ScienceAlert|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intel Partnership and OLPC Astroturf Controversy==
In 2007 Geekcorps Director Wayan Vota was accused of disparaging the OLPC project through a "OLPC News" website without disclosing Geekcorps' promotion of Intel's rival laptop, the [[Classmate PC]] and Microsoft's [[Windows XP]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222204738/http://www.0xdeadbeef.com:80/weblog/?p=252|title=conspiracy theories about olpcnews?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7890">The '''gyroscopic autopilot''' was  a type of autopilot system developed primarily for aviation uses in the early 20th century. Since then, the principles of this  autopilot  has been the basis of many different aircraft control systems, both military and civilian. 
==Early development==

The [[Sperry Corporation]] developed the original gyroscopic autopilot in 1912.  The device was called a “gyroscopic stabilizer apparatus,” and its purpose was to improve stability and control of aircraft.  It utilized the inputs from several other instruments to allow an aircraft to automatically maintain a desired compass heading and altitude.&lt;ref name=Scheck&gt;{{cite web|last=Scheck|first=William|title=Lawrence Sperry: Autopilot Inventor and Aviation Innovator|url=http://www.historynet.com/lawrence-sperry-autopilot-inventor-and-aviation-innovator.htm|work=Aviation History Magazine Online|accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The key feature of the gyroscopic stabilizer apparatus was that it incorporated a [[gyroscope]] to regulate the control surfaces of the aircraft.&lt;ref name=Scheck /&gt;  [[Lawrence Sperry]] managed to design a smaller and lighter version of a gyroscope,&lt;ref name=Scheck /&gt; and the device was integrated into an aircraft's hydraulic control system. Using a negative feedback loop, the gyroscope automatically adjusted the control surfaces of an aircraft to maintain straight and level flight.&lt;ref name=Scheck /&gt;

==First use==

Lawrence Sperry’s autopilot was first demonstrated in France on June 18, 1914.  Sperry was participating in an exhibition in which 57 planes were fitted with new improvements and innovations.  Sperry’s aircraft, a [[Curtiss Model F|Curtiss C-2]], was the only one equipped with a gyroscopic stabilizer.  Sperry, along with his assistant Emil Cachin, made three passes in front of a grandstand full of spectators and military observers. On his first pass, Sperry engaged the autopilot and flew past the grandstand with his hands held high off of the controls.  On the second pass, Cachin climbed out onto the starboard wing seven feet away from the fuselage with Sperry’s hands still off the controls.  When the aircraft banked due to the shift in weight, the autopilot immediately stabilized the wings.  On his final pass, Sperry climbed out onto the opposite wing, leaving the pilot seat empty. The observers were amazed at the aircraft’s ability to maintain level flight without a pilot manually controlling it.  Sperry also gave Joseph Barres, Commandant of the French Army Air Corps, a ride to demonstrate his device’s ability to perform an unassisted takeoff and landing.&lt;ref name=Scheck /&gt;

==Achievements==

[[Wiley Post]] became famous after his record setting trip around the world on June 23, 1931. In his aircraft, a [[Lockheed Vega]] nicknamed “Winnie Mae,” he managed to travel around the world in eight days 15 hours and 51 minutes.  He accomplished this with the help of [[Harold Gatty]], who served as his navigator and copilot.  Two years later he set out to beat his previous record by flying around the world by himself.  He wanted to prove that one man could accomplish the same trip without a copilot. In order to accomplish this, he equipped the Winnie Mae with a Sperry gyroscope autopilot and a [[radio direction finder]].   Although he experienced some problems with the autopilot, he completed the trip in seven days, 18 hours and 49 minutes. The use of the autopilot and radio direction finder is credited for making the task of navigating the aircraft much easier and more efficient.  The use of an autopilot reduced the physical and mental demands on Post as he flew around the world.&lt;ref name=Onkst&gt;{{cite web|last=Onkst|first=David|title=Wiley Post|url=http://centennialofflight.gov|publisher=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission|accessdate=4 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126212324/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/|archivedate=26 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early military applications==

The [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] and the [[U.S. Navy]] experimented with autopilots on military aircraft before and during World War II.  Straight and level flight had become a necessity for new level bombing techniques that were being developed at the time.  The Sperry Gyroscope Company developed many autopilot systems for use on military aircraft.  When the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] was delivered in the late 1930s, it came equipped a commercial Sperry A-3 Autopilot.  The A-3 was a simple autopilot and only corrected angular deviations in the aircraft’s straight and level course.  It utilized pneumatic hydraulic servos, which had a tendency to react slowly to inputs, and this often led to overcompensation of the aircraft’s corrected course.  This caused navigation and control issues when pilots were flying in poor weather or rough air.&lt;ref name=Searle&gt;{{cite web|last=Searle|first=Loyd|title=The Bombsight War: Norden vs Sperry|url=http://www.thevaluesell.com/images/LSearle_bombsight.pdf|work=Spectrum|accessdate=2017-11-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930165456/http://www.thevaluesell.com/images/LSearle_bombsight.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

To fix these problems, the Sperry A-5 autopilot was developed.  This was the first all electric autopilot.   This new autopilot used three dual-element [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers and high-speed gyros. Each amplifier was associated with a different axis: Yaw, pitch, and roll.  The high-speed gyros were more sensitive and established a base reference level of the aircraft’s level flight path.  Whenever the aircraft deviated from the base reference level, the autopilot adjusted for the amount of time that occurred between the changes in reference levels.  This allowed the autopilot to detect the velocity and acceleration of the change.  The calculated change was then communicated quickly to the control surfaces by independent electro-hydraulic servos.  This led to faster, more stable corrections of the aircraft.&lt;ref name=Searle /&gt; 

The faster stabilization of the aircraft by the A-5 autopilot made it possible for new bombsights to be used on military aircraft.  The [[Norden Bombsight]] and Sperry Bombsight were both used onboard Army and Navy bombers during the war.  Both bombsights used gyroscopes, telescopes and analog computers to calculate the release point for bombers to drop their payloads accurately onto ground targets.  The A-5 had the ability to be integrated with these bombsights.  Once the bombardier found the target and adjusted the bombsight, the autopilot would be engaged to fly the aircraft straight and level to the target, where the bombsight would automatically calculate the release point of the bombs.&lt;ref name=Searle /&gt;

===Missiles===

The German V-1 Buzz Bomb also used an autopilot system for guidance.  It used a pendulum system that was damped by a gyroscope, similar to the ones used in Sperry autopilots. It also used radio direction finding to maintain course.&lt;ref name=Zaloga&gt;{{cite book|last=Zaloga|first=Steven|title=V-1 Flying Bomb 1942–52|year=2005|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The use of autopilot on unmanned weapons can be seen as the precursor to modern cruise missiles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14478">A '''hydrogen sensor''' is a [[gas detector]] that detects the presence of [[hydrogen]]. They contain micro-fabricated point-contact hydrogen [[sensor]]s and are used to locate hydrogen leaks. They are considered low-cost, compact, durable, and easy to maintain as compared to conventional gas detecting instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.lib.sfu.ca/retrieve/2097/etd1726.pdf|title=MOS Capacitor Sensor Array for Hydrogen Gas Measurement|last=Qu|first=Xi Dong|year=2005|publisher=[[Simon Fraser University]]|accessdate=2008-10-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706203529/http://ir.lib.sfu.ca/retrieve/2097/etd1726.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key issues==
There are five key issues with hydrogen detectors:&lt;ref name="Pitts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/30535bb.pdf|title=Interfacial Stability Of Thin Film Hydrogen Sensors |last=Pitts|first=Ronald |author2=Ping Liu |author3=Se-Hee Lee |author4=Ed Tracy|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Function in an ambient air gas environment within a 10–98% relative humidity range
* Resistance to hydrocarbon and other interference.
* Lifetime greater than 10 years

==Types of microsensors==
There are various types of hydrogen microsensors, which use different mechanisms to detect the gas. [[Palladium]] is used in many of these, because it selectively absorbs hydrogen gas and forms the compound [[palladium hydride]].&lt;ref name="innovations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/physics_astronomy/report-44815.html|title=Hydrogen sensors are faster, more sensitive|date=2005-05-31|publisher=Innovations Report|accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palladium-based sensors have a strong temperature dependence which makes their response time too large at very low temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guemes|first=J. Alfredo|author2=Pintado, J. M. |author3=Frovel, M. |author4=Olmo, E. |author5= Obst, A. |date=May 2005|title=Comparison of three types of fibre optic hydrogen sensors within the frame of CryoFOS project|journal=17th International Conference on Optical Fibre Sensors|volume=5855|bibcode=2005SPIE.5855.1000G|doi=10.1117/12.623731|pages=1000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palladium sensors have to be protected against [[carbon monoxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]].

===Optical fibre hydrogen sensors===
Several types of [[optical fibre]] [[surface plasmon resonance]] (SPR) sensor are used for the point-contact detection of hydrogen:

*[[Fiber Bragg grating]] coated with a palladium layer – Detects the hydrogen by metal hindrance.
*Micromirror – With a palladium thin layer at the cleaved end, detecting changes in the backreflected light.&lt;!--???--&gt;
*Tapered fibre coated with palladium – Hydrogen changes the [[refractive index]] of the [[palladium]], and consequently the amount of losses in the [[evanescent wave]].

===Other types===
*Electrochemical hydrogen sensor – low (ppm) levels of hydrogen gas can be sensed using electrochemical sensors which comprise an array of electrodes packaged so as to be surrounded by a conductive electrolyte and gas ingress controlled with a diffusion limited capillary.
*MEMS hydrogen sensor – The combination of [[nanotechnology]] and [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) technology allows the production of a hydrogen microsensor that functions properly at room temperature. One type of MEMS-based hydrogen sensor is coated with a film consisting of nanostructured [[indium(III) oxide|indium oxide]] (In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[tin oxide]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsfreunano.research.ucf.edu/YearBook/Titans/2004/alvero.html|title=A Nanoparticle-based Hydrogen Microsensor|last=Alverio|first=Gustavo|publisher=University of Central Florida|accessdate=2008-10-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204162842/http://nsfreunano.research.ucf.edu/YearBook/Titans/2004/alvero.html|archivedate=2008-12-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical configuration for mechanical Pd-based hydrogen sensors is the usage of a free-standing cantilever that is coated with Pd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400502003155|title=Design and performance of a microcantilever-based hydrogen sensor|last=Baselt|first=D.R.|publisher=Sensors and Actuators B|accessdate=2013-02-26|doi=10.1016/S0925-4005(02)00315-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jjap.jsap.jp/link?JJAP/39/3584/|title=Hydrogen Gas Sensing Using a Pd-Coated Cantilever|last=Okuyama|first=Sumio|publisher=Japanese Journal of Applied Physics|accessdate=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the Pd layer expands and thereby induces a stress that causes the cantilever to bend. Pd-coated [[nanomechanical resonator]]s have also been reported in literature, relying on the stress-induced mechanical resonance frequency shift caused by the presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas. In this case, the response speed was enhanced through the use of a very thin layer of Pd (20&amp;nbsp;nm). Moderate heating was presented as a solution to the response impairment observed in humid conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2012/NR/c2nr30639e#!divAbstract|title=Ultra-low power hydrogen sensing based on a palladium-coated nanomechanical beam resonator|last=Henriksson|first=Jonas|publisher=Nanoscale Journal|accessdate=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the thin film, nanosized palladium particles swell when the hydride is formed, and in the process of expanding, some of them form new electrical connections with their neighbors.

The role of "matrix" is to transduce the signal to the measurement system. Thick film sensors are more stable than thin film sensors in terms of signal drifting, but generally exhibit slower sensor response due to diffusion constraints into a thick layer. Thick film sensor technology is getting substituted by thin film approaches due to the increasing need for sensor integration into modern electronic systems. Thick film sensors require increased temperatures for their operation and therefore appear to be poorly compatible with digital electronics systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1884">'''John Lees''' of Turf Lane, [[Royton]], [[Lancashire]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=K.|last=McPhillips |year=1977|title=Oldham: The Formative Years|publisher=Neil Richardson |isbn=1-85216-119-1|page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English inventor who made a substantial improvement to [[machine]]ry for [[carding]] [[cotton]].  

[[File:Restored carding machine at Quarry Bank Mill.jpg|right|thumb|Carding machine]]
He improved the carding machine in 1772 by adding a feeder to it in the form of a perpetually revolving cloth on which cotton wool was spread to convey the wool to the cylinder. On 25 June 1785, he proved this in the course of the trial concerning the validity of [[Richard Arkwright]]'s second [[patent]] (dated 1775) for his cotton-spinning [[water frame]].  

He was one of the carding mill owners sued by Arkwright in 1781, having built a [[cotton mill]] at Fowleach at [[Greenacres, Greater Manchester|Greenacres Moor]], in [[Oldham]]. He began by working a horsemill-powered cotton mill in 1776-78 but "raised himself from the extremest drudgery of the spinning room to the position of one of the most opulent inhabitants" of Oldham, with a mill and stock insured for over £2,000 in 1795.

John Lees was a Quaker and was the father of James Lees.

'''Juicero''' was a company that made a device for fruit and vegetable [[juicing]]. The company's product was called the Juicero Press, a [[Wi-Fi]] connected [[juicer]] that used single-serving packets of pre-juiced fruits and vegetables sold exclusively by the company by subscription. The [[San Francisco]]-based firm received $120 million in startup venture capital starting in 2014, from investors including [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]] and [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet Inc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39664483|title=Juicero: Juicing boss defends $400 machine|date=2017-04-21|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 1, 2017, the company announced that it was suspending sales of the juicer and the packets, repurchasing the juicer from its customers and searching for a buyer for the company and its intellectual property.&lt;ref name="RIP"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roof|first1=Katie|title=RIP Juicero, the $400 venture-backed juice machine|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/01/rip-juicero-the-400-venture-backed-juice-machine/|website=Tech Crunch|accessdate=September 1, 2017|date=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Juicero was founded in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/juicero-2/|title=Juicero loses another member of its founding team|last=Heater|first=Brian|date=2017-01-24|website=TechCrunch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Doug Evans, who served as CEO until October 2016, when former president of [[Coca-Cola]] North America Jeff Dunn took over the position. The company's juicing press was originally priced at $699 when launched in March 2016,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; but was reduced to $399 in January 2017, 12 to 18 months ahead of schedule, in response to slow sales of the device.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2017/01/17/juicero-juicer-price-cut/|title=Juicero Slashes Connected Juicer Price from $699 to $399|last=Kowitt|first=Beth|date=2017-01-17|website=Fortune|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Produce packs for the press, containing blends of chopped fruits and vegetables prepared by workers in a Juicero facility, cost between $5 and $7 each,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and each pack had a limited lifespan of about 8 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@Juicero/a-note-from-juiceros-new-ceo-cb23a1462b03|title=A Note from Juicero’s New CEO|date=2017-04-20|website=Juicero|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each pack had a [[QR code]] which was scanned and verified by the Internet-connected machine before it could be used.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/juicer-juicer-product-review-2017-4/#each-bag-has-a-breathing-hole-to-help-the-ingredients-stay-fresh-in-your-fridge-they-also-have-a-qr-code-which-is-necessary-for-the-juicero-juicer-to-work-juicero-wanted-to-learn-from-mistakes-keurig-has-made-and-one-problem-keurig-has-said-that-other-companies-are-making-pods-for-its-coffee-maker-and-stealing-profits-juiceros-qr-codes-prevent-any-other-companies-from-making-juicero-like-juice-bags-for-its-machine-the-machine-wont-work-if-it-doesnt-recognize-the-product-it-scans-11|title=What it's like to use the $400 juicer that people are freaking out about|last=Shontell|first=Alyson|date=2017-04-20|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-04-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Carson|first2=Biz|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEO Jeff Dunn claimed this was to prevent packs from being used past their expiration date, and to facilitate food safety recalls, though critics felt that the feature was a form of [[digital rights management]] as it would prevent operation of the press with any produce pack not made by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/new-money/2017/4/21/15376038/juicero-explained|title=Juicero, the $399 internet-connected juicer, explained|last=Lee|first=Timothy B.|date=2017-04-21|work=Vox|access-date=2017-04-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial design for the press was completed by [[Yves Behar]]'s studio [[Fuseproject]], based in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2016/06/01/juicero-machine-yves-behar-nespresso-style-countertop-cold-press-juicer/|title=Yves Behar designs Nespresso-style countertop juicer|last=Tucker|first=Emma|date=2016-06-01|work=Dezeen|access-date=2017-04-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In 2017, Juicero was the target of widespread criticism when [[Bloomberg News]] published a story suggesting that the company's produce packs could be squeezed by hand easily and effectively, and that hand-squeezing produced juice that was nearly indistinguishable in quantity and quality from the output of the company's expensive Press device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-04-19/silicon-valley-s-400-juicer-may-be-feeling-the-squeeze|title=Silicon Valley’s $400 Juicer May Be Feeling the Squeeze|date=2017-04-19|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company defended its product and its process, claiming that squeezing packs by hand created undue mess and promoted a poor user experience, and later offered full refunds to any customers unsatisfied with its Press device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/20/15375940/juicero-full-refund-customers-ceo-jeff-dunn|title=Juicero offering refunds to all customers after people realize $400 juicer is totally unnecessary|last=Kastrenakes|first=Jacob|date=20 April 2017|website=The Verge|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-20/juicero-offers-all-customers-a-refund-amid-critical-coverage|title=Juicero Offers All Customers a Refund|last=Huet|first=Ellen|date=2017-04-20|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-04-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking apart the device, venture capitalist Ben Einstein wrote that "Juicero’s Press is an incredibly complicated piece of engineering", but that the complexity was unnecessary and likely arose from a lack of cost constraints during the design process. A simpler and cheaper implementation, suggested Einstein, would likely have produced much the same quality of juice at a price several hundred US dollars cheaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.bolt.io/heres-why-juicero-s-press-is-so-expensive-6add74594e50|title=Here’s Why Juicero’s Press is So Expensive – Bolt Blog|date=24 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/juicero-teardown-hints-at-a-very-expensively-built-product/|title=Juicero teardown hints at a very expensively built product|last=Geuss|first=Megan|date=26 April 2017|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15419124/juicero-teardown-reveals-surprisingly-complicated-juicer|title=Juicero teardown reveals the secrets of a wildly overengineered juicer|first=Jacob|last=Kastrenakes|date=25 April 2017|website=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent [[YouTube]] electronics and equipment reviewer AvE came to similar conclusions in his own disassembly and review video for the Juicero, demonstrating the ease with which the produce packets could be squeezed by hand, and the considerable over-design and high build quality of the interior – the parts cost of which appeared to be over $1000 per machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Cp-BGQfpHQ/|title=Juicero, Cold Press Juicer for Rich Weirdos|last=|first=|date=|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juicero filed a complaint in federal court in April 2017 against a competing cold-press juicing device, the Froothie Juisir, for allegedly infringing its [[patent]] and copying Juicero's [[trade dress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/04/juice-wars-juicero-has-sued-another-juicer-maker-for-patent-infringement/|title=Juice wars: Juicero has sued another juicer maker for patent infringement|last=Geuss|first=Megan|date=21 April 2017|work=[[Ars Technica]]|access-date=22 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LCD generic tv.jpg|thumb|right|A generic LCD TV, with speakers on either side of the screen]]
'''Liquid-crystal-display televisions''' ('''LCD TV''') are [[television set]]s that use [[liquid-crystal display]]s to produce images. LCD televisions are thinner and lighter than [[cathode ray tube]] (CRTs) of similar display size, and are available in much larger sizes. When manufacturing costs fell, this combination of features made LCDs practical for television receivers.

In 2007, LCD televisions surpassed sales of CRT-based televisions worldwide for the first time,{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} and their sales figures relative to other technologies are accelerating. LCD TVs are quickly displacing the only major competitors in the large-screen market, the [[Plasma display|plasma display panel]] and [[rear-projection television]]. LCDs are, by far, the most widely produced and sold television display type.

LCDs also have a variety of disadvantages. Other technologies address these weaknesses, including [[organic light-emitting diode]]s (OLED), [[Field_emission_display|FED]] and [[Surface-conduction_electron-emitter_display|SED]].

===Early efforts===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
[[Passive matrix addressing|Passive matrix]] LCDs first became common in the 1980s for various portable computer roles. At the time they competed with plasma displays in the same market space. The LCDs had very slow refresh rates that blurred the screen even with scrolling text, but their light weight and low cost were major benefits. Screens using reflective LCDs required no internal light source, making them particularly well suited to laptop computers.

Refresh rates of early devices were too slow to be useful for television. Portable televisions were a target application for LCDs. LCDs consumed far less battery power then even the miniature tubes used in portable televisions of the era. The earliest commercially made LCD TV was the Casio TV-10 made in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frank's Handheld-TVs: Part 1|url=http://www.taschenfernseher.de/e-mini.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Resolutions were limited to [[standard definition]], although a number of technologies were pushing displays towards the limits of that standard; [[Super VHS]] offered improved color saturation, and [[DVD]]s added higher resolutions as well. Even with these advances, screen sizes over 30" were rare as these formats would start to appear blocky at normal seating distances when viewed on larger screens. Projection systems were generally limited to situations where the image had to be viewed by a larger audience.

Nevertheless, some experimentation with LCD televisions took place during this period. In 1988, Sharp Corporation introduced the first commercial LCD television, a 14" model with [[active matrix addressing]] using [[thin-film transistor]]s (TFT). These were offered primarily as boutique items for discerning customers, and were not aimed at the general market. At the same time, plasma displays could easily offer the performance needed to make a high quality display, but suffered from low brightness and very high power consumption. However, a series of advances led to plasma displays outpacing LCDs in performance improvements, starting with Fujitsu's improved construction techniques in 1979, Hitachi's improved phosphors in 1984, and [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|AT&amp;T]]'s elimination of the black areas between the sub-pixels in the mid-1980s. By the late 1980s, plasma displays were far in advance of LCDs.

===High-definition===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
It was the slow standardization of [[high definition television]] that first produced a market for new television technologies. In particular, the wider 16:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] of the new material was difficult to build using CRTs; ideally a CRT should be perfectly circular in order to best contain its internal vacuum, and as the aspect ratio becomes more rectangular it becomes more difficult to make the tubes. At the same time, the much higher resolutions these new formats offered were lost at smaller screen sizes, so CRTs faced the twin problems of becoming larger and more rectangular at the same time. LCDs of the era were still not able to cope with fast-moving images, especially at higher resolutions, and from the mid-1990s the plasma display was the only real offering in the high resolution space.

Through the halting introduction of HDTV in the mid-1990s into the early 2000s, plasma displays were the primary high-definition display technology. However, their high cost, both manufacturing and on the street, meant that older technologies like CRTs maintained a footprint in spite of their disadvantages. LCD, however, was widely considered to be unable to scale into the same space, and it was widely believed that the move to high-definition would push it from the market entirely.

This situation changed rapidly. Contrary to early optimism, plasma displays never saw the massive [[economies of scale]] that were expected, and remained expensive. Meanwhile, LCD technologies like Overdrive started to address their ability to work at television speeds. Initially produced at smaller sizes, fitting into the low-end space that plasmas could not fill, LCDs started to experience the economies of scale that plasmas failed to achieve. By 2004, 32" models were widely available, 42" sets were becoming common, and much larger prototypes were being demonstrated.

===Market takeover===
Although plasmas continued to hold an arguable picture quality edge over LCDs, and even a price advantage for sets at the critical 42" size and larger, LCD prices started falling rapidly in 2006 while their screen sizes were increasing at a similarly rapid rate. By late 2006, several vendors were offering 42" LCDs, albeit at a price premium, encroaching on plasma's only stronghold. More critically, LCDs offer higher resolutions and true [[1080p]] support, while plasmas were stuck at [[720p]], which made up for the price difference.&lt;ref name=shift&gt;Reuters, [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15916808/ "Shift to large LCD TVs over plasma"], ''MSNBC'', 27 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Predictions that prices for LCDs would drop rapidly through 2007 led to a "wait and see" attitude in the market, and sales of all large-screen televisions stagnated while customers watched to see if this would happen.&lt;ref name=shift/&gt; Plasmas and LCDs reached price parity in 2007, at which point the LCD's higher resolution was a winning point for many sales.&lt;ref name=shift/&gt; By late 2007, it was clear that LCDs were going to outsell plasmas during the critical Christmas sales season.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Swann, [http://www.tvpredictions.com/sam102907.htm "Sam's Club CEO: LCD Will Surpass Plasma"], TVPredictions, 29 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9584_22-6138290.html&lt;/ref&gt; This was in spite of the fact that plasmas continued to hold an image quality advantage, but as the president of Chunghwa Picture Tubes noted after shutting down their plasma production line, "Globally, so many companies, so many investments, so many people have been working in this area, on this product. So they can improve so quickly."&lt;ref name=shift/&gt;

When the sales figures for the 2007 Christmas season were finally tallied, pundits were surprised to find that LCDs had not only outsold plasma, but also outsold CRTs during the same period.&lt;ref name=outship&gt;Wolfgang Gruener, [http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/36119/118/ "LCD TVs outship CRT TVs for the first time"], ''TG Daily'', 19 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This evolution drove competing large-screen systems from the market almost overnight. Plasma had overtaken rear-projection systems in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=169300184 "Plasma TV sales overtake projection units, says report"] ''EETimes'', 17 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The same was true for CRTs, which lasted only a few months longer; Sony ended sales of their famous [[Trinitron]] in most markets in 2007, and shut down the final plant in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;MarketWatch, [http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/sony-stop-making-old-style-cathode/story.aspx?guid=%7B097C2A31-1395-41BC-A8B7-6A3A65B27F97%7D "Sony to stop making old-style cathode ray tube TVs"], ''Wall Street Journal ', 3 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The February 2009 announcement that [[Pioneer Electronics]] was ending production of the plasma screens was widely considered the tipping point in that technology's history as well.&lt;ref&gt;Jose Fermoso, [http://newteevee.com/2009/02/21/pioneers-kuro-killing-a-tipping-point-in-the-plasma-era/ "Pioneer’s Kuro Killing: A Tipping Point in the Plasma Era"], newteevee.com, 21 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

LCD's dominance in the television market accelerated rapidly.&lt;ref name=shift/&gt; It was the only technology that could scale both up and down in size, covering both the high-end market for large screens in the 40 to 50" class, as well as customers looking to replace their existing smaller CRT sets in the 14 to 30" range. Building across these wide scales quickly pushed the prices down across the board.&lt;ref name=outship/&gt;

In 2008, LCD TV shipments were up 33 percent year-on-year compared to 2007 to 105 million units.&lt;ref name="se2011-09-12"&gt;[http://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/flat-panel-tv-sales-dropped-in-q4-2008/ Flat Panel TV Sales Dropped in Q4 2008], February 18, 2009, Geoff Duncan, Digital Trends, retrieved at September 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent research===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}

Although current LCD panels are able to deliver all [[sRGB]] colors using an appropriate combination of backlight's spectrum and optical filters, manufacturers want to display even more colors. One of the approaches is to use a fourth, or even fifth and sixth color in the optical color filter array. Another approach is to use two sets of suitably narrowband [[backlight]]s (e.g. [[LED]]s), with slightly differing colors, in combination with broadband optical filters in the panel, and alternating backlights each consecutive frame.

Fully using the extended color gamut will naturally require an appropriately captured material and some modifications to the distribution channel. Otherwise, the only use of the extra colors would be to let the looker boost the color saturation of the TV picture beyond what was intended by the producer, but avoiding the otherwise unavoidable loss of detail ("burnout") in saturated areas.

=== Competing systems ===
In spite of LCD's current dominance of the television field, there are several other technologies being developed that address its shortcomings. Whereas LCDs produce an image by selectively blocking a backlight, [[OLED]], [[Field emission display|FED]] and [[Surface-conduction_electron-emitter_display|SED]] all produce light directly on the front face of the display. In comparison to LCDs, all of these technologies offer better viewing angles, much higher brightness and contrast ratio (as much as 5,000,000:1), and better color saturation and accuracy, and use less power. In theory, they are less complex and less expensive to build.

Actually manufacturing these screens has proved more difficult than originally imagined. Sony abandoned their FED project in March 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2009/03/26/sonys-field-emission-technologies-closing-its-doors/ "Sony's Field Emission Technologies closing its doors"], ''Engadget''&lt;/ref&gt; but continue work on their OLED sets. Canon continues development of their SED technology, but announced that they will not attempt to introduce sets to market for the foreseeable future.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Harding, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/577ed3f0-c011-11dd-9222-0000779fd18c,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F577ed3f0-c011-11dd-9222-0000779fd18c.html&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSurface-conduction_electron-emitter_display "Canon clear to launch new type of TV"], ''Financial Times'', 2 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samsung]] has been displaying OLED sets at 14.1, 31 and 40&amp;nbsp;inch sizes for some time, and at the [[Society for Information Display|SID 2009]] trade show in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] they announced that the 14.1 and 31&amp;nbsp;inch sets are "production ready".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oled-display.net/smd-unveils-production-ready-oled-tvs-and-amoleds-at-sid-2009 "SMD unveils production ready OLED-TVs and AMOLEDs at SID 2009"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}

=== Basic concepts ===
[[File:Home cinema 01.jpg|thumb|LCD television at home together with [[PlayStation 3]] and some other equipment]]

[[Liquid crystal]]s encompass a wide range of (typically) rod-shaped polymers that naturally form into thin, ordered layers, as opposed to the more random alignment of a normal [[liquid]]. Some of these, the ''nematic liquid crystals'', also show an alignment effect between the layers. The particular direction of the alignment of a nematic liquid crystal can be set by placing it in contact with an ''alignment layer'' or ''director'', which is essentially a material with microscopic grooves in it, on the supporting substrates. When placed on a director, the layer in contact will align itself with the grooves, and the layers above will subsequently align themselves with the layers below, the bulk material taking on the director's alignment. In the case of a ''Twisted Nematic'' (TN) LCD, this effect is utilized by using two directors arranged at right angles and placed close together with the liquid crystal between them. This forces the layers to align themselves in two directions, creating a twisted structure with each layer aligned at a slightly different angle to the ones on either side.

LCD televisions produce a colored image by selectively filtering light produced by a [[backlight]], originally provided by a series of [[Cold cathode|cold cathode fluorescent lamp]]s (CCFLs) but now typically by white or colored [[LED]]s. Millions of individual LCD shutters, arranged in a grid, open and close to allow a metered amount of the white light through. Each shutter is paired with a colored filter to remove all but the red, green or blue (RGB) portion of the light from the original white source. Each shutter–filter pair forms a single ''sub-pixel''. The sub-pixels are so small that when the display is viewed from even a short distance, the individual colors blend together to produce a single spot of color, a ''[[pixel]]''. The shade of color is controlled by changing the relative intensity of the light passing through the sub-pixels.

LCD shutters consist of a stack of three primary elements. On the bottom and top of the shutter are [[polarizer]] plates set at right angles. Normally light cannot travel through a pair of polarizers arranged in this fashion, and the display would be black. The polarizers also carry the directors to create the twisted structure aligned with the polarizers on either side. As the light flows out of the rear polarizer, it will naturally follow the liquid crystal's twist, exiting the front of the liquid crystal having been rotated through the correct angle, that allows it to pass through the front polarizer. LCDs are normally transparent in this mode of operation. To turn a shutter off, a voltage is applied across it from front to back. The rod-shaped molecules align themselves with the electric field instead of the directors, distorting the twisted structure. The light no longer changes polarization as it flows through the liquid crystal, and can no longer pass through the front polarizer. By controlling the voltage applied across the liquid crystal, the amount of remaining twist can be selected. This allows the transparency of the shutter to be controlled. To improve switching time, the cells are placed under pressure, which increases the force to re-align themselves with the directors when the field is turned off.

Several other variations and modifications have been used in order to improve performance in certain applications. [[IPS panel|In-Plane Switching]] displays (IPS and S-IPS) offer wider viewing angles and better color reproduction, but are more difficult to construct and have slightly slower response times. Vertical Alignment (VA, S-PVA and MVA) offer higher [[contrast ratio]]s and good response times, but suffer from color shifting when viewed from the side. In general, all of these displays work in a similar fashion by controlling the polarization of the light source.

===Addressing sub-pixels===
[[Image:TN display closeup 300X.jpg|thumb|right|A close-up (300×) view of a typical LCD, clearly showing the sub-pixel structure. The "notch" at the lower left of each sub-pixel is the thin-film transistor. The associated capacitors and addressing lines are located around the shutter, in the dark areas.]]

In order to address a single shutter on the display, a series of electrodes is deposited on the plates on either side of the liquid crystal. One side has horizontal stripes that form rows, the other has vertical stripes that form columns. By supplying voltage to one row and one column, a field will be generated at the point where they cross. Since a metal [[electrode]] would be opaque, LCDs use electrodes made of a transparent conductor, typically [[indium tin oxide]].

Since addressing a single shutter requires power to be supplied to an entire row and column, some of the field always leaks out into the surrounding shutters. Liquid crystals are quite sensitive, and even small amounts of leaked field will cause some level of switching to occur. This partial switching of the surrounding shutters blurs the resulting image. Another problem in early LCD systems was the voltages needed to set the shutters to a particular twist was very low, but that voltage was too low to make the crystals re-align with reasonable performance. This resulted in slow [[Response time (technology)|response time]]s and led to easily visible "[[Ghosting (television)|ghosting]]" on these displays on fast-moving images, like a mouse cursor on a computer screen. Even scrolling text often rendered as an unreadable blur, and the switching speed was far too slow to use as a useful television display.

In order to address these problems, modern LCDs use an [[active matrix]] design. Instead of powering both electrodes, one set, typically the front, is attached to a common ground. On the rear, each shutter is paired with a [[thin-film transistor]] that switches on in response to widely separated voltage levels, say 0 and +5 volts. A new addressing line, the ''gate line'', is added as a separate switch for the transistors. The rows and columns are addressed as before, but the transistors ensure that only the single shutter at the crossing point is addressed; any leaked field is too small to switch the surrounding transistors. When switched on, a constant and relatively high amount of charge flows from the ''source line'' through the transistor and into an associated [[capacitor]]. The capacitor is charged up until it holds the correct control voltage, slowly leaking this through the crystal to the common ground. The current is very fast and not suitable for fine control of the resulting store charge, so [[pulse code modulation]] is used to accurately control the overall flow. Not only does this allow for very accurate control over the shutters, since the capacitor can be filled or drained quickly, but the response time of the shutter is dramatically improved as well.

===Building a display===
A typical shutter assembly consists of a sandwich of several layers deposited on two thin glass sheets forming the front and back of the display. For smaller display sizes (under 30&amp;nbsp;inches (760 mm)), the glass sheets can be replaced with plastic.

The rear sheet starts with a polarizing film, the glass sheet, the active matrix components and addressing electrodes, and then the director. The front sheet is similar, but lacks the active matrix components, replacing those with the patterned color filters. Using a multi-step construction process, both sheets can be produced on the same assembly line. The liquid crystal is placed between the two sheets in a patterned plastic sheet that divides the liquid into individual shutters and keeps the sheets at a precise distance from each other.

The critical step in the manufacturing process is the deposition of the active matrix components. These have a relatively high failure rate, which renders those pixels on the screen "always on". If there are enough broken pixels, the screen has to be discarded. The number of discarded panels has a strong effect on the price of the resulting television sets, and the major downward fall in pricing between 2006 and 2008 was due mostly to improved processes.

To produce a complete television, the shutter assembly is combined with control electronics and backlight. The backlight for small sets can be provided by a single lamp using a diffuser or frosted mirror to spread out the light, but for larger displays a single lamp is not bright enough and the rear surface is instead covered with a number of separate lamps. Achieving even lighting over the front of an entire display remains a challenge, and bright and dark spots are not uncommon.

==Comparison to other technologies==
[[File:Sony KDL-S19A10.jpg|thumb|A 19" [[Sony]] LCD TV]]

===Packaging===
In a CRT the electron beam is produced by heating a metal filament, which "boils" electrons off its surface. The electrons are then accelerated and focused in an [[electron gun]], and aimed at the proper location on the screen using [[electromagnet]]s. The majority of the power budget of a CRT goes into heating the filament, which is why the back of a CRT-based television is hot. Since the electrons are easily deflected by gas molecules, the entire tube has to be held in vacuum. The atmospheric force on the front face of the tube grows with the area, which requires ever-thicker glass. This limits practical CRTs to sizes around 30&amp;nbsp;inches; (76 cm) displays up to 40&amp;nbsp;inches (102 cm)  were produced but weighed several hundred pounds, and televisions larger than this had to turn to other technologies like [[rear projection television|rear-projection]].

The lack of vacuum in an LCD television is one of its advantages; there is a small amount of vacuum in sets using CCFL backlights, but this is arranged in cylinders which are naturally stronger than large flat plates. Removing the need for heavy glass faces allows LCDs to be much lighter than other technologies. 

LCD panels, like other [[flat panel display]]s, are also much thinner than CRTs. Since the CRT can only bend the electron beam through a critical angle while still maintaining focus, the electron gun has to be located some distance from the front face of the television. In early sets from the 1950s the angle was often as small as 35 degrees off-axis, but improvements, especially computer assisted convergence, allowed that to be dramatically improved and, late in their evolution, folded. Nevertheless, even the best CRTs are much deeper than an LCD.

LCDs can, in theory, be built at any size, with production yields being the primary constraint. As yields increased, common LCD screen sizes grew, from 14" (35 cm) to 30" (70 cm), to 42" (107 cm), then 52" (132 cm), and 65" (165 cm) sets are now widely available. This allowed LCDs to compete directly with most in-home projection television sets, and in comparison to those technologies direct-view LCDs have a better image quality. Experimental and limited run sets are available with sizes over 100&amp;nbsp;inches (254 cm).

===Efficiency===

LCDs are relatively inefficient in terms of power use per display size, because the vast majority of light that is being produced at the back of the screen is blocked before it reaches the viewer. To start with, the rear polarizer filters out over half of the original un-polarized light. Examining the image above, you can see that a good portion of the screen area is covered by the cell structure around the shutters, which removes another portion. After that, each sub-pixel's color filter removes the majority of what is left to leave only the desired color. Finally, to control the color and luminance of a pixel as a whole, some light is lost when passing the front polarizer in the on-state by the imperfect operation of the shutters.

For these reasons the backlighting system has to be ''extremely'' powerful. In spite of using highly efficient CCFLs, most sets use several hundred watts of power, more than would be required to light an entire house with the same technology. As a result, LCD televisions using CCFLs end up with overall power usage similar to a CRT of the same size.  Plasma displays are worse; the best are on par with LCDs, but typical sets draw much more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6475_7-6400401-3.html?tag=arw "The chart: 139 HDTVs' power consumption compared"], ''cnet''&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern LCD sets have attempted to address the power use through a process known as "dynamic lighting" (originally introduced for other reasons, see below). This system examines the image to find areas that are darker, and reduces the backlighting in those areas. CCFLs are long cylinders that run the length of the screen, so this change can only be used to control the brightness of the screen as a whole, or at least wide horizontal bands of it. This makes the technique suitable only for particular types of images, like the credits at the end of a movie. In 2009 some manufacturers&lt;ref&gt;http://news.sel.sony.com/en/press_room/consumer/television/release/38249.html&lt;/ref&gt; made some TVs using [[HCFL]] (more power efficient than CCFL). Sets using distributed LEDs behind the screen, with each LED lighting only a small number of pixels, typically a 16 by 16 patch, allow for better ''local dimming'' by dynamically adjusting the brightness of much smaller areas, which is suitable for a much wider set of images.

Another ongoing area of research is to use materials that optically route light in order to re-use as much of the signal as possible. One potential improvement is to use microprisms or dichromic mirrors to ''split'' the light into R, G and B, instead of absorbing the unwanted colors in a filter. A successful system would improve efficiency by three times. Another would be to direct the light that would normally fall on opaque elements back into the transparent portion of the shutters.

Several newer technologies, [[OLED]], [[Field_emission_display|FED]] and [[Surface-conduction_electron-emitter_display|SED]], have lower power use as one of their primary advantages. All of these technologies directly produce light on a sub-pixel basis, and use only as much power as that light level requires. [[Sony]] has demonstrated 36" FED units displaying very bright images drawing only 14&amp;nbsp;W, less than 1/10 as much as a similarly sized LCD. OLEDs and SEDs are similar to FEDs in power terms. The lower power requirements make these technologies particularly interesting in low-power uses like [[laptop computer]]s and [[mobile phone]]s. These sorts of devices were the market that originally bootstrapped LCD technology, due to its light weight and thinness.

===Image quality===
[[File:TVportatil.jpg|thumb|A traveler pocket-size LCD TV]]

Early LCD sets were widely derided for their poor overall [[image quality]], most notably the [[Ghosting (television)|ghosting]] on fast-moving images, poor contrast ratio, and muddy colors. In spite of many predictions that other technologies would always beat LCDs, massive investment in LCD production, manufacturing, and electronic image processing has addressed many of these concerns.

====Response time====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}

For 60 frames per second video, common in North America, each pixel is lit for 17&amp;nbsp;ms before it has to be re-drawn (at 50 frames per second, it's 20&amp;nbsp;ms in Europe). Early LCDs had response times on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, which made them useless for television. A combination of improvements in materials technology since the 1970s greatly improved this, as did the active matrix techniques. By 2000, LCD panels with response times around 20&amp;nbsp;ms were relatively common in computer roles. This was still not fast enough for television use.

A major improvement, pioneered by [[NEC]], led to the first practical LCD televisions. NEC noticed that liquid crystals take some time to start moving into their new orientation, but stop rapidly. If the initial movement could be accelerated, the overall performance would be increased. NEC's solution was to boost the voltage during the "spin up period" when the capacitor is initially being charged, and then dropping back to normal levels to fill it to the required voltage. A common method is to double the voltage, but halve the pulse width, delivering the same total amount of power. Named "Overdrive" by NEC, the technique is now widely used on almost all LCDs.

Another major improvement in response time was achieved by adding memory to hold the contents of the display&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; something that a television needs to do anyway, but was not originally required in the [[computer monitor]] role that bootstrapped the LCD industry. In older displays the active matrix capacitors were first drained, and then recharged to the new value with every refresh. But in most cases, the vast majority of the screen's image does not change from frame to frame. By holding the before and after values in [[computer memory]], comparing them, and only resetting those sub-pixels that actually changed, the amount of time spent charging and discharging the capacitors was reduced. Moreover, the capacitors are not drained completely; instead, their existing charge level is either increased or decreased to match the new value, which typically requires fewer charging pulses. This change, which was isolated to the driver electronics and inexpensive to implement, improved response times by about two times.

Together, along with continued improvements in the liquid crystals themselves, and by increasing refresh rates from 60&amp;nbsp;Hz to 120 and 240&amp;nbsp;Hz, response times fell from 20&amp;nbsp;ms in 2000 to about 2&amp;nbsp;ms in the best modern displays. But even this is not really fast enough because the pixel will still be switching while the frame is being displayed. Conventional CRTs are well under 1&amp;nbsp;ms, and plasma and OLED displays boast times on the order of 0.001&amp;nbsp;ms.

One way to further improve the ''effective'' refresh rate is to use "super-sampling", and it is becoming increasingly common on high-end sets. Since the blurring of the motion occurs during the transition from one state to another, this can be reduced by doubling the refresh rate of the LCD panel, and building intermediate frames using various [[motion compensation]] techniques. This smooths out the transitions, and means the backlighting is turned on only when the transitions are settled. A number of high-end sets offer 120&amp;nbsp;Hz (in North America) or 100&amp;nbsp;Hz (in Europe) refresh rates using this technique. Another solution is to only turn the backlighting on once the shutter has fully switched. In order to ensure that the display does not flicker, these systems fire the backlighting several times per refresh, in a fashion similar to movie projection where the shutter opens and closes several times per frame.

====Contrast ratio====

Even in a fully switched-off state, liquid crystals allow some light to leak through the shutters. This limits their contrast ratios to about 1600:1 on the best modern sets, when measured using the ANSI measurement (ANSI IT7.215-1992). Manufacturers often quote the "Full On/Off" contrast ratio instead, which is about 25% greater for any given set.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.practical-home-theater-guide.com/contrast-ratio.html "What is Contrast: Defining and Measuring Contrast Ratio"], Practical Home Theatre Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

This lack of contrast is most noticeable in darker scenes. To display a color close to black, the LCD shutters have to be turned to almost full opacity, limiting the number of discrete colors they can display. This leads to "posterizing" effects and bands of discrete colors that become visible in shadows, which is why many reviews of LCD TVs mention the "shadow detail".&lt;ref&gt;Al Griffin, [http://www.soundandvisionmag.com/hdtvs/1836/sony-bravia-kdl-40xbr2-40-inch-lcd-hdtv.html?print_page=y "Sony Bravia KDL-40XBR2 40-inch LCD HDTV"], ''Sound &amp; Vision Magazine'', November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, the highest-end [[LED TV]]s offer regular contrast ratios of 5,000,000:1.

Since the total amount of light reaching the viewer is a combination of the backlighting and shuttering, modern sets can use "dynamic backlighting" or ''local dimming'' to improve the contrast ratio and shadow detail. If a particular area of the screen is dark, a conventional set will have to set its shutters close to opaque to cut down the light. However, if the backlighting is reduced by half in that area, the shuttering can be reduced by half, and the number of available shuttering levels in the sub-pixels doubles. This is the main reason high-end sets offer dynamic lighting (as opposed to power savings, mentioned earlier), allowing the contrast ratio across the screen to be dramatically improved. While the LCD shutters are capable of producing about 1000:1 contrast ratio, by adding 30 levels of dynamic backlighting this is improved to 30,000:1.

However, the area of the screen that can be dynamically adjusted is a function of the backlighting source. CCFLs are thin tubes that light up many rows (or columns) across the entire screen at once, and that light is spread out with diffusers. The CCFL must be driven with enough power to light the brightest area of the portion of the image in front of it, so if the image is light on one side and dark on the other, this technique cannot be used successfully. Displays backlit by full arrays of [[Light-emitting diode television|LED]]s have an advantage, because each LED lights only a small patch of the screen. This allows the dynamic backlighting to be used on a much wider variety of images. ''Edge-lit'' displays do not enjoy this advantage. These displays have LEDs only along the edges and use a light guide plate covered with thousands of convex bumps that reflect light from the side-firing LEDs out through the LCD matrix and filters. LEDs on edge-lit displays can be dimmed only globally, not individually. For cost reasons, most of LCD TVs have edge-lit backlighting.

The massive on-paper boost this method provides is the reason many sets now place the "dynamic contrast ratio" in their specifications sheets. There is widespread debate in the audio-visual world as to whether or not dynamic contrast ratios are real, or simply marketing speak.&lt;ref&gt;David Field, [http://www.itnews.com.au/News/85948,opinion-dynamic-contrast-ratio-is-the-new-evil-in-displays.aspx "Opinion: Dynamic contrast ratio is the new evil in displays"], ''iTnews'', 3 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.practical-home-theater-guide.com/contrast-ratio.html "The Contrast Ratio Game"], Practical Home Theater Guide, 23 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewers commonly note that even the best LCDs cannot match the contrast ratios or deep blacks of plasma displays, in spite of being rated, on paper, as having much higher ratios. However, since 2014 there are no major manufacturers of plasma displays left. Contrast leaders are now displays based on OLEDs. 

====Color gamut====

{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
Color on an LCD television is produced by filtering down a white source and then selectively shuttering the three primary colors relative to each other. The accuracy and quality of the resulting colors are thus dependent on the backlighting source and its ability to evenly produce white light. The CCFLs used in early LCD televisions were not particularly white, and tended to be strongest in greens. Modern backlighting has improved this, and sets commonly quote a color space covering about 75% of the [[gamut|NTSC 1953 color gamut]]. Using white LEDs as the backlight improves this further.

In September 2009 [[Nanoco]], a UK company, announced that it had signed a joint development agreement with a major Japanese electronics company under which it will design and develop [[Quantum dots|quantum dots (QD)]] for use in LED backlights in LCD televisions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nanocogroup.com/content/Library/NewsandEvents/articles/Nanoco_Signs_Agreement_with_Major_Japanese_Electronics_Company/136.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum dots are valued for displays, because they emit light in very specific [[Gaussian distribution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/consumer-electronics/audiovideo/what-the-heck-are-quantum-dots ''CES 2015 - What the Heck are Quantum Dots?''] IEEE Spectrum, January 2, 2015. Retrieved January 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; This can result in a display that more accurately renders the colors that the human eye can perceive. To generate white light best suited as an LCD backlight, parts of the light of a blue-emitting LED are transformed by quantum dots into small-bandwidth green and red light such that the combined white light allows for a nearly ideal color gamut generated by the color filters of the LCD panel. In addition, efficiency is improved, as intermediate colors (wavelengths) are not present anymore and don't have to be filtered out by the RGB color filters of the LCD screen. US company [[QD Vision]] worked with [[Sony]] to launch LCD TVs using this technique under the marketing label ''Triluminos'' in 2013.

At the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] 2015, [[Samsung Electronics]], [[LG Electronics]], the Chinese [[TCL Corporation]] and Sony showed QD-enhanced LED-backlighting of LCD TVs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/consumer-electronics/audiovideo/ces-2015-placing-bets-on-the-new-tv-technologies ''CES 2015 - Placing bets on the New TV Technologies.''] IEEE Spectrum, January 7, 2015. Retrieved January 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnet.com/news/lg-leaps-quantum-dot-rivals-with-new-tv/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental effects==
{{See also|Electronic waste}}
The production of LCD screens uses [[nitrogen trifluoride]] (NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as an etching fluid during the production of the thin-film components. NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a potent [[greenhouse gas]], and its relatively long [[half-life]] may make it a potentially harmful contributor to [[global warming]]. A report in ''Geophysical Research Letters'' suggested that its effects were theoretically much greater than better-known sources of greenhouse gasses like [[carbon dioxide]]. As NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was not in widespread use at the time, it was not made part of the [[Kyoto Protocol]]s and has been deemed "the missing greenhouse gas".&lt;ref name=nf3&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/environment/95111/your_flat_screen_has_(greenhouse)_gas/ "NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; used in plasma and LCD screens"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the report point out that it assumes that all of the NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; produced would be released to the atmosphere. In reality, the vast majority of NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is broken down during the cleaning processes; two earlier studies found that only 2 to 3% of the gas escapes destruction after its use.&lt;ref name=natgas&gt;Hannah Hoag, [http://www.nature.com/climate/2008/0808/full/climate.2008.72.html "The missing greenhouse gas"], ''Nature Reports Climate Change'', 10 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the report failed to compare NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'s effects with what it replaced, [[perfluorocarbon]], another powerful greenhouse gas, of which anywhere from 30 to 70% escapes to the atmosphere in typical use.&lt;ref name=natgas/&gt;

[[File:MYRRHA Reactor vessel and its internals.svg|alt=MYRRHA Reactor vessel and its internals|thumb|500x500px|MYRRHA Reactor vessel and its internals]]
The '''MYRRHA''' ('''Multi-purpose hYbrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications''') is a "first of its kind" design project of a [[nuclear reactor]] coupled to a [[proton accelerator]] (a so-called [[Accelerator-driven subcritical reactor|Accelerator-driven system]] (ADS)).  MYRRHA will be a [[lead-bismuth cooled fast reactor]] with two possible configurations: sub-critical or critical.

The project is managed by [[SCK•CEN]], the Belgium center for nuclear energy research.  It will be built based on the experience gained from the first successful demonstration project: GUINEVERE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/physics/2012/01/reactor-accelerator-hybrid-achieves-successful-test-run|title=Reactor-Accelerator Hybrid Achieves Successful Test Run|date=12 January 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MYRRHA has an international recognition and has been listed in December 2010 by the [[European Commission]] as one of 50 projects to make Europe the leader in high-tech research in the next 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/result/brief/rcn/11105_fr.html|title=Viser les déchets nucléaires avec un faisceau de protons - Result In Brief - CORDIS - European Commission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MYRRHA is a [[research reactor]] aiming to demonstrate the feasibility of the ADS and the [[lead-cooled fast reactor]] concepts, with various applications from [[Spent nuclear fuel|spent-fuel]] burning to material irradiation testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/INPRO/2nd_Dialogue_Forum/MYRRHA_IAEA_INPRO_7.10.pdf|title=IAEA website, " MYRRHA, An innovative and unique irradiation research facility"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MYRRHA is intended to be fully operational in 2033, with a first phase (100 MeV accelerator) ready in 2027.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inrwww.webarchiv.kit.edu/pdfs/ads-roadmap.pdf], page 46&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special features ==

=== Accelerator ===
The ADS concept consists of coupling a [[subcritical reactor]] [[Nuclear reactor core|core]] with a proton accelerator.  The [[neutron]]s missing from the sub-critical core in order to sustain the [[Nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]] originate from the spallation reaction of high energy [[Charged particle beam|proton beam]] with a [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] target.  In order to operate a subcritical core with multiplication factor of k=0.95, a [[particle accelerator]] able to provide a maximum [[Current (electricity)|current]] of 4 mA beam of 600 MeV protons is needed.  The option of a [[LINAC]] is currently preferred.

Due to the extreme rarity of such a stable accelerated proton beam, the MYRRHA project decided to include a fundamental physics experiment called Isol@MYRRHA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isolMYRRHA.sckcen.be/|title=ISOL@MYRRHA home - SCK•CEN|website=isolmyrrha.sckcen.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a fraction of the proton beam.

=== Spallation target ===
The spallation reaction requires a high Z material, chemical elements with a high [[atomic number]] (Z) of protons in the nucleus, as a target.

=== Fuel elements ===
[[MOX fuel|Mixed oxide fuel]] (MOX) with an enrichment of 30% is planned to be used in the core. 15-15 Ti [[Austenitic stainless steel]] cladding allows for good corrosion resistance along with known behavior in the nuclear industry.

=== Subcritical core ===
{{see also|Subcritical reactor}}
An important feature is the flexibility of MYRRHA, allowing two possible core configurations: subcritical or critical.

The subcritical core has an effective multiplication factor of 0.95: this is a unique feature in the world of nuclear reactors and will allow very innovative applications for MYRRHA such as burning of [[actinide]]s or very long cycle operation.

=== Mechanical design ===
MYRRHA is a pool type lead-bismuth reactor; therefore the mechanical features will be a very heavy core, and atmospheric pressure operation of primary coolant loop.  The coolant is very corrosive but operating temperature is quite low.  An additional constraint is the opacity of lead-bismuth.

== Towards validation ==
Recently, MYRRHA has entered a new phase in the validation process, with two new experiments aimed at providing insight into the thermo-hydraulic and resistance to earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=L'Echo|date={{date|2014-01-31}}|page=6|title=Deux installations test dédiées au futur réacteur nucléaire MYRRHA|language=French|trans-title=Two test facilities dedicated to future nuclear reactor MYRRHA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[EU Commission]] has supported MYRRHA in the past and can earmark funds in 2016 for it.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DA/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:JOC_2014_405_R_0001&amp;rid=1#d1e8712-1-1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schedule, budget and financing ==
The three-phase implementation plan starts with the construction of the particle accelerator and PTF station (Proton Target Facility). This fully modular facility, called MINERVA, will be operational by 2027. 

During this first period (2018-2026), the research and development needed to develop the 600 MeV particle accelerator (phase 2) and to construct the reactor (phase 3) will also be carried out. Phases 2 and 3 will be carried out simultaneously between 2027 and 2033. The MYRRHA research facility will be operational by 2030.

MYRRHA has a total budget of 1.6 billion euros. The Belgian government has financially supported the project since 2010 and has committed to financing 40% of the total infrastructure cost. A budget of 100 million euros has already been allocated for the R&amp;D period, for the design of the facility and for the implementation plan (2010-2017). In March 2018, the Federal authorities confirmed the allocation of 19.5 million euros this year in the construction of MYRRHA as well as its commitment in the project from 2019 onwards. On 7 September 2018, the government decided to invest 558 million euros more in the MYRRHA project. This will be used to complete phase 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Belgian-government-approves-funding-for-Myrrha|title=Belgian government approves funding for Myrrha|last=|first=|date=10 September 2018|work=World nuclear news|access-date=www.world-nuclear-news.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this Belgian state support, MYRRHA will be funded by the creation of an international consortium of investors and by European Investment Bank (EIB) financing. A large number of partners have already expressed interest, such as France, Japan, Sweden, the USA and Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18696">'''Neste Renewable Diesel''' (formerly NExBTL) is a [[Vegetable oil refining|renewable diesel]] fuel production process commercialized by the [[Finland|Finnish]] oil and refining company [[Neste]]. Whether as an admixture or in its pure form, Neste Renewable Diesel is able to supplement or partially replace diesel fuel without problems. Unblended Neste Renewable Diesel meets the requirements set by the European pre-standard CEN TS 15940. Fuel blends meet the European diesel fuel standard EN 590.

Despite the former name [[Biomass to liquid|BTL]], the feedstock is [[Vegetable fats and oils|vegetable oil]] and waste animal fats, not whole plants. However, fuel quality is equal to the synthetic [[Fischer–Tropsch process|Fischer-Tropsch]] BTL and GTL diesel fuels.

==Process==
Neste Renewable Diesel is produced in a patented [[vegetable oil refining]] process. Chemically, it entails direct catalytic [[hydrodeoxygenation]] ([[hydrogenolysis]]) of plant oils, which are [[triglyceride]]s, into the corresponding [[alkane]]s and [[propane]]. The glycerol chain of the triglyceride is hydrogenated to the corresponding C3 alkane, [[propane]] — there is no [[glycerol]] sidestream. This process removes oxygen from the oil; the diesel is not an [[oxygenate]] like traditional transesterified FAME [[biodiesel]]. Catalytic isomerization into branched alkanes is then done to adjust the cloud point in order to meet winter operability requirements. As it is chemically identical to ideal conventional diesel, it requires no modification or special precautions for the engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climatechange.ca.gov/events/2006-06-27+28_symposium/presentations/CalHodge_handout_NESTE_OIL.PDF|title=NExBTL Renewable Synthetic Diesel|last=|first=|date=|website=climatechange.ca.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418133813/http://www.climatechange.ca.gov/events/2006-06-27+28_symposium/presentations/CalHodge_handout_NESTE_OIL.PDF|archive-date=2010-04-18|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SAE_Study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nesteoil.com/binary.asp?GUID=09FBFA64-E84C-4A7D-8D3C-4A45B726E2F0|title=Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) as a Renewable Diesel Fuel|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=SAE International|type=pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809083307/http://www.nesteoil.com/binary.asp?GUID=09FBFA64-E84C-4A7D-8D3C-4A45B726E2F0|archive-date=2011-08-09|dead-url=|accessdate=2010-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neste has estimated that the use of NExBTL diesel cuts greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 90 percent in comparison to fossil based diesel.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nesteoil.com/default.asp?path=1,41,11991,12243,15658|title=Flexible mix of raw materials|last=|first=|date=|website=nesteoil.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819195940/http://www.nesteoil.com/default.asp?path=1,41,11991,12243,15658|archive-date=2013-08-19|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the chemistry of the process, the renewable diesel is pure [[alkane]] and contains no aromatics, oxygen (although oxygen would have promoted cleaner combustion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00102200290021353 | volume=174 | title=Effects of oxygenate additives on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(pahs) and soot formation | journal=Combustion Science and Technology | pages=1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or sulfur.&lt;ref name=SAE_Study /&gt;{{Deadlink|date=March 2018}}

==Feedstocks==
A mix of palm oil, rapeseed oil, and waste fat from the food industry can be used. Initially, [[palm oil]] was the principal (90%) feedstock, although its share was reduced to 53% by 2013&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and to less than 20% by 2017.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.is.fi/taloussanomat/art-2000005395171.html|title=Nesteen Lievonen: Polttoaineiden kysyntä kasvaa, vaikka autokanta sähköistyy|last=|first=|date=2017-10-04|work=Ilta-Sanomat|access-date=2018-03-18|language=fi-FI|quote=Aluksi uusiutuvaa dieseliä valmistettiin 95-prosenttisesti palmuöljystä, mutta nyt sen osuus on laskenut alle 20 prosenttiin.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palm oil may endanger the carbon neutrality of the fuel if forest is cleared and swamps drained to make way for palm plantations. In response to this concern, Neste has joined the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to certify that the palm oil is produced in a carbon-neutral, environmentally responsible manner. Neste purchases most of its palm oil from [[IOI Group|IOI]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKSGC00160620080115|title=Neste Oil S'pore plant to buy palm oil from IOI Corp|last=|first=|date=2008-01-15|work=|accessdate=2008-02-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229231445/https://uk.reuters.com/article/neste-biodiesel/neste-oil-spore-plant-to-buy-palm-oil-from-ioi-corp-idUKSGC00160620080115|archive-date=2017-12-29|dead-url=no|publisher=Reuters UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; but requires a separate production chain for the RSPO-certified palm oil, in order not to create demand for rainforest destruction.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Deforestation would release carbon to the atmosphere, and reduce the overall carbon binding capacity of the land, thus it would be counterproductive with respect to the carbon balance. In 2007, [[Greenpeace]] protested the use of palm oil, concluding the potential for deforestation remains. According to Greenpeace, increasing the production of palm oil reduces the available land area, so indirectly generates demand for rainforest destruction, even if the palm oil itself is rainforest-certified. Greenpeace noted RSPO is voluntary organization and claimed government regulation in palm oil producing countries, such as [[Indonesia]], cannot be relied on because of [[political corruption]]. Greenpeace also claimed palm oil diesel can actually produce three to 10 times more carbon dioxide emissions than petrodiesel because of the indirect effects of clearing of [[swamp]]s, forest fires and indirect generation of demand for land area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/finland/fi/kampanjat/ilmasto/ei-sademetsaeae-tankkiin/kysymyksiae-ja-vastauksia-palmu|title=Kysymyksiä ja vastauksia palmuöljystä|author=Greenpeace|first=|date=|website=greenpeace.org|language=finnish|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=March 2018}} Greenpeace demands that Neste should use domestic feedstocks such as  [[rapeseed oil]] or [[biogas]], instead. However, rapeseed is a slower-growing, cold-climate source with lesser carbon-binding potential than the oil palm, making emissions from cultivation and transport proportionally more severe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 2017, the share of palm oil in the feedstock has been reduced to less than 20%,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; being replaced by reclaimed waste oils such as used frying oil, animal and fish fat, and camelina, jatropha, soy and rapeseed oil. Use of reclaimed waste oil reduces the greenhouse gas impact by 88–91%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Neste is continuing to look into new feedstock, including [[algae fuel|algae]], [[jatropha oil|jatropha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nesteoil.com/default.asp?path=1,41,11991,12243,12139|title=New raw materials are researched|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Nesteoil.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127010440/http://www.nesteoil.com/default.asp?path=1,41,11991,12243,12139|archive-date=2010-11-27|dead-url=|accessdate=2010-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[microbial oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nesteoil.com/default.asp?path=1;41;540;1259;1260;13292;15693|title=Waste-based microbial oil set to become a raw material for renewable diesel|last=|first=|date=2010-09-21|website=nesteoil.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126193058/http://www.nesteoil.com/default.asp?path=1;41;540;1259;1260;13292;15693|archive-date=2010-11-26|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/articles/4456/neste-banks-on-waste-based-microbial-oil|title=Neste banks on waste-based microbial oil|last=|first=|date=2010-09-29|website=biodieselmagazine.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228232024/http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/articles/4456/neste-banks-on-waste-based-microbial-oil|archive-date=2017-12-28|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Needs update|date=March 2018}}

==Use==
This diesel is blended with petrodiesel. A market is created because the European Union required 5.75% of transport fuels should be biofuels by 2010. The EU further decided on 18 December 2008, that by 2020, the share of energy from renewable sources in all forms of transportation be at least 10% of the final consumption of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/strategies/2008/doc/2008_01_climate_action/2008_0609_en.pdf|title=Promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources|last=|first=|date=|website=europa.eu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023234603/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/strategies/2008/doc/2008_01_climate_action/2008_0609_en.pdf|archive-date=2012-10-23|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems and regions without an electrical grid will be the long-term market for hydrotreated vegetable oils, as the EU prefers electrical use by factor 2.5. In the Helsinki area, the [[Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council]] and the [[Helsinki City Transport]] conducted a three-year experiment by running buses with 25% Neste Renewable Diesel at first, and then switching to 100% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;YTV.

As a result of its hydrocarbon nature, Neste Renewable Diesel operates without problems in current diesel vehicles in all climatic conditions. It does not have any of the drawbacks of the traditional ester type FAME biodiesel, such as cold operability, 'best before' date, engine and fuel system deposit formation, risk for microbial growth and water pick up, engine oil dilution and deterioration.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Neste Renewable Diesel can be blended into diesel fuel in any ratio, whereas the use of the traditional FAME biodiesel is limited to maximum 7% by the EN 590 standard in order to avoid technical problems in engines and vehicles.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The European Union requires the use of renewable fuel, therefore it is expected to be a major market for Neste Renewable Diesel.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

'''Novelty''' (derived from Latin word novus for "new") is the quality of being new, or following from that, of being striking, original or unusual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/novelty |title=Novelty |work=Merriam-Webster.com |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novelty may be the shared experience of a new cultural phenomenon or the subjective perception of an individual.

From the meaning of being unusual usage is derived the concept of the [[novelty dance]] (a type of dance that is popular for being unusual or humorous); the [[novelty song]] (a musical item that capitalizes on something new, unusual, or a current fad); the [[novelty show]] (a competition or display in which exhibits or specimens are in some way novel); and [[novelty architecture]] (a building or other structure that is interesting because it has an amusing design). It is also this sense that applies to a [[novelty item]], a small manufactured adornment, toy or collectible. These, in turn are often used as [[promotional merchandise]] in [[marketing]]. The [[Glossary of chess#N|chess term, novelty]], is used for a move in chess which has never been played before in a recorded game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chess.com/article/view/endgame-novelty |title=
Endgame Novelty |author=Iryna Zenyuk |date=August 12, 2010 |work=chess.com |accessdate=January 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term can have pejorative sense and refer to a mere ''innovation''. However, [[Novelty (patent)|novelty in patent law]] is part of the legal test to determine whether an invention is patentable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/patents/a/patent_novelty.htm |title=Guide To Patenting And USPTO Patent Applications |author=Mary Bellis |work=About.com Inventors |accessdate=January 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[novelty effect]] is the tendency for performance to initially improve when new technology is instituted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thoughtgadgets.com/2011/07/spider-man-renewed-and-novelty-effect.html |title=Spider-man renewed and the novelty effect|work=Thought Gadgets |accessdate=January 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Optical''' or '''photonic computing''' uses [[photon]]s produced by [[lasers]] or [[diode]]s for computation. For decades, photons have promised to allow a higher [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] than the [[electrons]] used in conventional computers.

Most research projects focus on replacing current computer components with optical equivalents, resulting in an optical [[digital computer]] system processing [[binary data]]. This approach appears to offer the best short-term prospects for commercial optical computing, since optical components could be integrated into traditional computers to produce an optical-electronic hybrid. However, [[optoelectronic]] devices lose 30% of their energy converting electronic energy into photons and back; this conversion also slows the transmission of messages. All-optical computers eliminate the need for optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversions, thus lessening the need for electrical power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=D.D. |last=Nolte |title=Mind at Light Speed: A New Kind of Intelligence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9lB-REWP5EC&amp;pg=PA34 |date=2001 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-7432-0501-6 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Application-specific devices, such as [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) and ''[[optical correlator]]s'', have been designed to use the principles of optical computing. Correlators can be used, for example, to detect and track objects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Optical Computing: A Survey for Computer Scientists |chapter=Chapter 3: Optical Image and Signal Processing |last=Feitelson |first=Dror G. |date=1988 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=0-262-06112-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to classify serial time-domain optical data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kim |first=S. K. |last2=Goda |first2=K.|last3=Fard |first3=A.

==Optical components for binary digital computer==
The fundamental building block of modern electronic computers is the [[transistor]]. To replace electronic components with optical ones, an equivalent [[optical transistor]] is required. This is achieved using materials with a [[Refractive index#Nonlinearity|non-linear refractive index]]. In particular, materials exist&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rp-photonics.com/nonlinear_index.html&lt;/ref&gt; where the intensity of incoming light affects the intensity of the light transmitted through the material in a similar manner to the current response of a bipolar transistor. Such an optical transistor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jain |first=K. |last2=Pratt, Jr. |first2=G. W. |title=Optical transistor |journal=Appl. Phys. Lett. |volume=28 |issue=12 |pages=719 |date=1976 |doi=10.1063/1.88627 |bibcode=1976ApPhL..28..719J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jainprattpatent&gt;{{cite patent

}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to create optical [[logic gates]],&lt;ref name=jainprattpatent /&gt; which in turn are assembled into the higher level components of the computer's [[CPU]]. These will be nonlinear optical crystals used to manipulate light beams into controlling other light beams.

Like any computing system, an Optical computing system needs three things to function well:
# optical processor
# optical data transfer, eg. Fiber optic cable
# optical storage, eg. CD/DVD/bluray, etc. 
Substituting electrical components will need data format conversion from photons to electrons, which will make the system slower.

===Controversy===
There are disagreements between researchers about the future capabilities of optical computers; whether or not they may be able to compete with semiconductor-based electronic computers in terms of speed, power consumption, cost, and size is an open question. Critics note that&lt;ref name="Tucker"&gt;{{cite journal |first=R.S. |last=Tucker |title=The role of optics in computing |journal=Nature Photonics |volume=4 |pages=405 |date=2010 |doi=10.1038/nphoton.2010.162 |url=http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v4/n7/full/nphoton.2010.162.html|bibcode=2010NaPho...4..405T }}&lt;/ref&gt; real-world logic systems require "logic-level restoration, cascadability, [[fan-out]] and input–output isolation", all of which are currently provided by electronic transistors at low cost, low power, and high speed. For optical logic to be competitive beyond a few niche applications, major breakthroughs in non-linear optical device technology would be required, or perhaps a change in the nature of computing itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rajan|first1=Renju|last2=Babu|first2=Padmanabhan Ramesh|last3=Senthilnathan|first3=Krishnamoorthy|title=All-Optical Logic Gates Show Promise for Optical Computing|url=https://www.photonics.com/a63226/All-Optical_Logic_Gates_Show_Promise_for_Optical|website=Photonics|publisher=Photonics Spectra|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rajan|first1=Renju|last2=Babu|first2=Padmanabhan Ramesh|last3=Senthilnathan|first3=Krishnamoorthy|title=The Dawn of Photonic Crystals: An Avenue for Optical Computing|publisher=Intech|isbn=978-953-51-3962-1|url=https://www.intechopen.com/books/theoretical-foundations-and-application-of-photonic-crystals/the-dawn-of-photonic-crystals-an-avenue-for-optical-computing|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misconceptions, challenges, and prospects==
A significant challenge to optical computing is that computation is a [[nonlinear]] process in which multiple signals must interact. Light, which is an [[electromagnetic wave]], can only interact with another electromagnetic wave in the presence of electrons in a material,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0387946594 |author=Philip R. Wallace|title= Paradox Lost: Images of the Quantum|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the strength of this interaction is much weaker for electromagnetic waves, such as light, than for the electronic signals in a conventional computer. This may result in the processing elements for an optical computer requiring more power and larger dimensions than those for a conventional electronic computer using transistors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

A further misconception is that since light can travel much faster than the [[drift velocity]] of electrons, and at frequencies measured in [[Terahertz (unit)|THz]], optical transistors should be capable of extremely high frequencies. However, any electromagnetic wave must obey the [[Bandwidth-limited pulse|transform limit]], and therefore the rate at which an optical transistor can respond to a signal is still limited by its [[spectral bandwidth]]. However, in [[fiber optic communications]], practical limits such as [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] often constrain [[Wavelength-division multiplexing|channels]] to bandwidths of 10s of GHz, only slightly better than many silicon transistors. Obtaining dramatically faster operation than electronic transistors would therefore require practical methods of transmitting [[ultrashort pulse]]s down highly dispersive waveguides.

==Photonic logic==
[[File:optical-NOT-gate.png|thumb|right|Realization of a photonic controlled-NOT gate for use in quantum computing]]

Photonic logic is the use of photons ([[light]]) in [[logic gate]]s (NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR). Switching is obtained using [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical effects]] when two or more signals are combined.&lt;ref name=jainprattpatent /&gt;

[[Optical cavity|Resonator]]s are especially useful in photonic logic, since they allow a build-up of energy from [[constructive interference]], thus enhancing optical nonlinear effects.

Other approaches currently being investigated include photonic logic at a [[Nanotechnology|molecular level]], using [[Photoluminescence|photoluminescent]] chemicals. In a recent demonstration, Witlicki et al. performed logical operations using molecules and [[surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy|SERS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Molecular Logic Gates Using Surface-Enhanced Raman-Scattered Light | first9 = Amar H. | last9 = Flood | first8 = Lasse | last8 = Jensen | first7 = Eric W. | last7 = Wong | first6 = Jan O. | last6 = Jeppesen | first5 = Vincent J. | last5 = Bottomley | first4 = Daniel W. | last4 = Silverstein | first3 = Stinne W. | last3 = Hansen | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | first2 = Carsten | date = 2011 | volume = 133 | issue = 19 | last2 = Johnsen | pages = 7288–91 | doi = 10.1021/ja200992x | first = Edward H. | last = Witlicki }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unconventional approaches==

===Time delays optical computing===

The basic idea is to delay light (or any other signal) in order to perform useful computations.&lt;ref name="oltean_hamiltonian"&gt;{{cite conference|author=Mihai Oltean|title= A light-based device for solving the Hamiltonian path problem |conference=Unconventional Computing| pages= 217–227| publisher= Springer LNCS 4135|doi=10.1007/11839132_18|date=2006|arxiv=0708.1496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of interest would be to solve [[NP-completeness|NP-complete problems]] as those are difficult problems for the conventional computers.

There are 2 basic properties of light that are actually used in this approach:

* The light can be delayed by passing it through an optical fiber of a certain length.
* The light can be split into multiple (sub)rays. This property is also essential because we can evaluate multiple solutions in the same time.

When solving a problem with time-delays the following steps must be followed:

* The first step is to create a graph-like structure made from optical cables and splitters. Each graph has a start node and a destination node.
* The light enters through the start node and traverses the graph until it reaches the destination. It is delayed when passing through arcs and divided inside nodes.
* The light is marked when passing through an arc or through an node so that we can easily identify that fact at the destination node.
* At the destination node we will wait for a signal (fluctuation in the intensity of the signal) which arrives at a particular moment(s) in time. If there is no signal arriving at that moment, it means that we have no solution for our problem. Otherwise the problem has a solution. Fluctuations can be read with an [[photodetector]] and an [[oscilloscope]].

The first problem attacked in this way was the [[Hamiltonian path problem]].&lt;ref name="oltean_hamiltonian"/&gt; Later, [http://www.tcreate.org/optical other problems have been tackled in this way].

The simplest one is the [[subset sum problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mihai Oltean, Oana Muntean| title = Solving the subset-sum problem with a light-based device|journal= Natural Computing|publisher= Springer-Verlag| volume= 8| issue= 2|pages =321–331| doi=10.1007/s11047-007-9059-3| date=2009 |arxiv=0708.1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; An optical device solving an instance with 4 numbers {a1, a2, a3, a4} is depicted below:

[[File:Optical device for solving the Subset sum problem.png|Optical device for solving the Subset sum problem]]

The light will enter in Start node. It will be divided into 2 (sub)rays of smaller intensity. These 2 rays will arrive into the second node at moments a1 and 0. Each of them will be divided into 2 subrays which
will arrive in the 3rd node at moments 0, a1, a2 and a1 + a2. These represents the all subsets of the set {a1, a2}. We expect fluctuations in the intensity of the signal at no more than 4 different moments. In the destination node we expect fluctuations at no more than 16 different moments (which are all the subsets of the given. If we have a fluctuation in the target moment B, it means that we have a solution of the problem, otherwise there is no subset whose sum of elements equals B. For the practical implementation we cannot have zero-length cables, thus all cables are increased with a small (fixed for all) value k. In this case the solution is expected at moment B+n*k.

===Wavelength-based computing===

Wavelength-based computing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Sama Goliaei, Saeed Jalili|title= An Optical Wavelength-Based Solution to the 3-SAT Problem|conference=Optical SuperComputing Workshop|date=2009|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-10442-8_10| pages=77–85|bibcode=2009LNCS.5882...77G}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to solve the [[Boolean satisfiability problem#3-satisfiability|3-SAT]] problem with n variables, m clause and with no more than 3 variables per clause. Each wavelength, contained in a light ray, is considered as possible value-assignments to n variables. The optical device contains prisms and mirrors are used to discriminate proper wavelengths which satisfy the formula.

===Computing by xeroxing on transparencies===

This approach uses a Xerox machine and transparent sheets for performing computations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Tom Head|title= Parallel Computing by Xeroxing on Transparencies|conference= Algorithmic Bioprocesses|date= 2009|pages=631–637|publisher=Springer|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-88869-7_31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boolean satisfiability problem#3-satisfiability|k-SAT problem]] with n variables, m clauses and at most k variables per clause has been solved in 3 steps:

* Firstly all 2^n possible assignments of n variables have been generated by performing n xerox copies.
* Using at most 2k copies of the truth table, each clause is evaluated at every row of the truth table simultaneously.
* The solution is obtained by making a single copy operation of the overlapped transparencies of all m clauses.

===Masking optical beams===

The [[travelling salesman problem]] has been solved in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= NT Shaked, S Messika, S Dolev, J Rosen |title=Optical solution for bounded NP-complete problems|journal= Applied Optics| publisher=OSA|pages=711–724|volume=46|issue=5|date=2007|doi=10.1364/AO.46.000711|bibcode=2007ApOpt..46..711S}}&lt;/ref&gt; by using an optical approach. All possible TSP paths have been generated and stored in a binary matrix which was multiplied with another gray-scale vector containing the distances between cities. The multiplication is performed optically by using an optical correlator.

===Optical Fourier co-processors===

Many computations, particularly in scientific applications, require frequent use of the 2D [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT) – for example in solving differential equations describing propagation of waves or transfer of heat. Though modern GPU technologies typically enable high-speed computation of large 2D DFTs, recently techniques have been developed that can perform DFTs optically by utilising the natural [[Fourier optics#Fourier transforming property of lenses|Fourier transforming property of lenses]]. The input is encoded using a [[liquid crystal]] [[spatial light modulator]] and the result is measured using a conventional CMOS or CCD image sensor. Such optical architectures can offer superior scaling of computational complexity due to the inherently highly interconnected nature of optical propagation, and have been used to solve 2D heat equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= A. J. Macfaden, G. S. D. Gordon, T. D. Wilkinson |title=An optical Fourier transform coprocessor with direct phase determination|journal= Scientific Reports | publisher= Nature Publishing Group | volume = 7 |date=2017|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-13733-1|bibcode=2017NatSR...713667M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ising machines ===

Physical computers whose design was inspired by the theoretical [[Ising model]] are called Ising machines.&lt;ref name="courtland" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cartlidge" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Adrian Cho.
[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/10/odd-computer-zips-through-knotty-tasks "Odd computer zips through knotty tasks"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yoshihisa Yamamoto (scientist)|Yoshihisa Yamamoto]] pioneered building Ising machines using photons. Initially Yamamoto and his colleagues built an Ising machine using lasers, mirrors, and other optical components commonly found on an [[optical table]].&lt;ref name="courtland" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cartlidge"&gt;
Edwin Cartlidge.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Later a team at [[Hewlett Packard Labs]] including Dave Kielpinski developed [[photonic chip]] design tools and used them to build an Ising machine on a single chip, integrating 1,052 optical components on that single chip.&lt;ref name="courtland"&gt;

[[File:PlayStation-SCPH-1000-with-Controller.png|thumb|300px|right|The very first PlayStation model, the Japanese SCPH-1000, shown with original controller and memory card.]]
A number of '''models of Sony's [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]''' video game console were produced.

==Revisions of standard PlayStation hardware {{anchor|Variants|variants}} {{anchor|Revisions|revisions}}==

[[File:PlayStation-Model-Backs.jpg|thumb|A comparison of the SCPH-1001 (bottom), SCPH-5501 (middle) and SCPH-9001 (top) models. The SCPH-900x revision saw the removal of the Parallel I/O port while the RCA jacks were removed in the SCPH-550x revision.]]
The PlayStation went through a number of variants during its production run, each accompanied by a change in the part number. From an external viewpoint, the most notable change was the gradual reduction in the number of external connectors from the back of the unit. This started very early on with the original Japanese launch units; the SCPH-1000, released on December 3, 1994, was the only model that had an [[S-Video]] port, which was removed on the next release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Presenting the Sony PlayStation|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=84|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=September 1995|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also led to a discrepancy where the US and European launch units had the same part number series (SCPH-100x) as the Japanese launch units, but had different hardware (Rev. B silicon and no S-Video port)—their technical equivalents were the Japanese SCPH-3000, so for consistency should have been SCPH-3001 and SCPH-3002. Inconsistent numbering was also used for the Yaroze machines, which were based on SCPH-5000 and later 1001/1002 hardware, but numbered DTL-H3000, DTL-H3001, and DTL-H3002. Also, the first models (DTL-H1000, DTL-H1001, DTL-H1002) had problems with [[printf]] function and developers had to use another function instead. 

This series of machines had a reputation for CD drive problems — the original optical pickup sled (KSM-440AAM) was made of thermoplastic and placed close to the power supply, eventually leading to uneven wear that moved the laser into a position where it was no longer parallel with the CD surface. Late KSM-440ACM drives had the sled replaced with a die-cast one with hard nylon inserts in order to address the issue.

The original hardware design included dual-ported [[VRAM]] as graphics memory, but due to a shortage in parts, Sony redesigned the GPU to use [[SGRAM]] instead (which could simulate dual-porting to some extent by using two banks). At the same time the GPU was upgraded to utilize smoother shading, resulting in overall better image quality compared to earlier models, which were more prone to banding&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HKjcxCuRfM&lt;/ref&gt;; additionally, performance for transparency effects was improved, resulting in less slowdown in scenes using this effect heavily. This Rev. C hardware first appeared in late 1995 and, unlike in Japan, was not marked with a model number change in NTSC-U and PAL territories - SCPH-1001/1002 systems can have either revision, as the change happened between revisions of the PU-8 mainboard.

The PAL region consoles from SCPH-1002 up to SCPH-5552 were different from the systems released in other regions in that they had a different menu design; a grey blocked background with square icons for the Memory Card (an icon showing a PlayStation with 2 memory cards inserted) and CD player (an icon with musical keyboards) menus. The CD player also included reverberation effects unique to those systems until the release of the PS one in 2000, which featured a slightly modified version of the BIOS.

With the release of the SCPH-5000 series being produced only in Japan, it followed the same exterior design as the Japanese SCPH-3xxx series, its only differences being that it was switched to Rev. C hardware (same as late 1001/1002 units) with some upgrades to flawed components from previous models and a reduced retail price. This was followed by the first major consolidation, SCPH-550x/5001 and PAL-exclusive SCPH-5552 units, released in April 1997. This model further addressed the reliability issues with the disc drive assembly by placing the drive further away from the power supply in order to reduce heat; the chipset was also redesigned to use digital servo for focus/tracking and also to auto-calibrate the drive, as opposed to manual gain/bias calibration on earlier models. Also, shielding and PSU wiring were simplified, and from the SCPH-5001 on the RCA jacks and RFU power connectors were removed from the rear panel and the printed text on the back was changed to reliefs of the same. Starting with the SCPH-550x series, PAL variants had the "power" and "open" buttons changed from text to symbols, something that would later appear on the redesigned PS one. Originally, the PlayStation was supposed to have provision on [[Video CD]] support, but this feature was only included on the Asian exclusive SCPH-5903 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maru-chang.com/hard/scph/index.php/consoles/english/ |title=SCPH |publisher=maru-chang.com |date=2005-10-26 |accessdate=2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These were followed by the SCPH-700x and SCPH-750x series, released in April 1998—they are externally identical to the SCPH-500x machines, but have internal changes made to reduce manufacturing costs (for example, the system RAM went from 4 chips to 1, and the CD controller went from 3 chips to 1) and these were the last models to support parallel port for [[Gameshark]] devices. In addition, a slight change of the start-up screen was made; the diamond is seen as longer and thinner and the [[trademark symbol]] (™) is now placed after "Computer Entertainment" instead of after the diamond, as it was on the earlier models. New to the SCPH-700x series was the introduction of the "Sound Scope" - light show music visualizations. These were accessible by pressing the Select button while playing any normal audio CD in the system's CD player. While watching these visualizations, players could also add various effects like color cycling or motion blur and can save/load their memory card. These were seen on the SCPH-700x, 750x, 900x, and PS one models.

The final revision to the original PlayStation was the SCPH-900x series, released in May 1999. These had the same hardware as the SCPH-750x models, except the parallel port was removed and the size of the PCB is further reduced. The removal of the parallel port is partially due to the fact that Sony did not release an official add-on for it; it was used for cheat cartridges for the parallel port to defeat the [[regional lockout]]s and [[copy protection]]. The SCPH-900x was the last model to support [[PlayStation Link Cable]] connection, as the Serial I/O port was removed on all PS one models.

The [[#PS one|PS one]], released on July 7, 2000, was originally based on essentially the same hardware as the SCPH-900x; the serial port was removed, the controller / memory card ports moved to the main PCB and the internal power supply replaced with an external 7.5VDC power adapter with the other required power rails being generated internally on the main using a mixture of regulators and DC/DC converters for the various rails. It also incorporated a slightly modified version of the menu design previously used only on PAL consoles. The later revision (still designated as SCPH-10x, but with a different PM-41(2) main circuit board) was functionally identical, but reduced manufacturing cost for a last time by moving to more highly integrated chips, namely the replacement of external RAM with on-chip RAM, which both reduced the parts count and allowed the use of smaller and cheaper packages by reducing the number of pins required.

==Debugging units {{anchor|debug}}==

[[File:DTL-H1102.jpg|thumb|Debugging station PlayStation (PAL)]]
There were also debugging consoles - these were generally in either blue or green cases, although there were some special production units (mostly intended for use as show demo units) that were grey, the same as the retail consoles.  The debug units were designed to be as close as possible to retail consoles, so they only had 2MB of ram (the developer boards had 8MB) and had standard retail boot ROMs. The only real difference is that the CD controller was reprogrammed so that it would identify any disc that had a data track as being "licensed", rather than requiring the region code in the lead-in that was present on pressed PlayStation CDs. This was done to allow developers to burn games to CD-R for testing - a side effect of this was that most debug consoles would also boot discs from other regions (one notable exception being the later NTSC:J debugs, which only boot Japanese titles), although this was not officially supported - Sony made specific debug consoles for each region, and the technical required checklist provided by Sony for each region required you to test your title on the correct debug stations.

The reason for the two different case colors was a hardware change that Sony had made fairly early in the PlayStation production cycle - the original machines were built using Rev. A (early Japan market units) or Rev. B (later Japan units, US and Europe) hardware, both using the same GPU with VRAM to store the video data. Later models used Rev. C silicon and [[#SGRAM|SGRAM]] - although the two chipsets had very similar performance, and Rev. C was explicitly designed with compatibility in mind, they were not identical - the Rev. C version was significantly faster at doing alpha blending, and hence the PS "semitransparent" writing mode - it was also rather slow at certain screen memory block moves (basically, ones involving narrow vertical strips of the display) on top of this there were some minor hardware bugs in the older silicon that had been addressed by including workarounds for them in the libraries - the later library versions checked the GPU type at startup time and disabled the patches if they were not needed. Because this made the two machine types quite significantly different from each other, you had to test your title on both of them before submitting it. The blue debugs (DTL-H100x, DTL-H110x) had the old silicon and the green ones (DTL-H120x) had the new silicon.

==Net Yaroze==

{{main|Net Yaroze}}

In 1997, Sony released a version of the PlayStation called the [[Net Yaroze]]. It was more expensive than the original PlayStation, colored black instead of the usual gray, and most importantly, came with tools and instructions that allowed a user to be able to program PlayStation games and applications without the need for a full developer suite, which cost many times the amount of a PlayStation and was only available to approved [[video game developer]]s. Naturally, the Net Yaroze lacked many of the features the full developer suite provided.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Programmers were also limited by the 2 MB of total game space that [[Net Yaroze]] allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=PlayStation Turns 10|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|date=Nov 2005|issue=197|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of space may seem small, but games like ''Ridge Racer'' ran entirely from the system RAM (except for the streamed music tracks).&lt;ref name="NGen25"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=If You Can Build a Better Game...|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=25 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=January 1997|pages=40-49}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unique in that it was the only officially retailed PlayStation with no [[regional lockout]]; it would play games from any territory. It would not however play CD-R discs, so it was not possible to create self-booting Yaroze games without a modified PlayStation.&lt;ref name="NGen25"/&gt;

The '''PS one''' (alternatively spelled as '''PS One''', '''PSOne''' or '''PSone''') is a smaller, redesigned version of the original PlayStation platform.&lt;ref name="PSOne"/&gt; (Dimensions are 38&amp;nbsp;mm × 193&amp;nbsp;mm × 144&amp;nbsp;mm versus 45&amp;nbsp;mm × 260&amp;nbsp;mm × 185&amp;nbsp;mm.)

The PS one model also had additional changes, including the removal of the parallel and serial ports from the rear of the console, and the removal of the reset button (the power button is also labeled as a reset button, but the console cannot be reset without entirely turning it off).

[[File:Sony-PSone-Console-wScreen-Open-FL.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The PS one with LCD Screen attachment.]]

Sony also released a version with a 5" [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] screen and an adaptor (though it did not have a battery: it is powered by plugging the adaptor in a main socket, or in a car). It was called the '''Combo''' pack. However, it includes a headphone jack (for headphones or other audio connection) and an AV mini jack for connecting camcorders or other devices.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;All models feature ''A/V Direct Out'', ''Parallel Port'' and ''Serial Port''; none feature ''Sound Scope''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;All models use a low-quality CD drive.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;All models (except those with later Japanese boot ROM) can boot software with any region code.

===Region codes===

The last digit of the PlayStation model number denotes the region in which it was sold:
* '''0''' is Japan (Japanese boot ROM, NTSC:J region, NTSC Video, 100&amp;nbsp;V PSU)
* '''1''' is USA/Canada (English boot ROM, NTSC:U/C region, NTSC Video, 110&amp;nbsp;V PSU)
* '''2''' is Europe/Australia/[[PAL region]] (English boot ROM, PAL region, PAL Video, 220-240&amp;nbsp;V PSU)
* '''3''' is Asia (English boot ROM, NTSC:J region, NTSC video, Wide range 110-240&amp;nbsp;V PSU)

===Quality of construction===
The first batch of PlayStations used a KSM-440AAM [[laser]] unit whose case and all movable parts were completely made out of plastic. Over time, friction caused the plastic tray to wear out—usually unevenly. The placement of the laser unit close to the power supply accelerated wear because of the additional heat, which made the plastic even more vulnerable to friction. Eventually, the tray would become so worn that the laser no longer pointed directly at the CD and games would no longer load. Sony first addressed the problem by making the tray out of [[die casting|die-cast]] metal, and additionally also placed the laser unit farther away from the power supply on later models of the PlayStation.

Some units, particularly the early 100x models, would be unable to play [[Full motion video|FMV]] or music correctly, resulting in skipping or freezing. In more extreme cases the PlayStation would only work correctly when turned onto its side or upside down.

The toy system launched in October 2015 with the Marvel Avengers collection. [[Star Wars]] and [[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]] were planned for 2016 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/06/16/disney-playmation-wearable-toys/|title=Marvel’s Avengers Playmation toys will be followed by sets based on Star Wars and Frozen over the next three years.|author=John Gaudiosi|work=Fortune|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is reported that much of the development team has been laid-off and that while the existing Avengers product line will continue to be sold through Christmas 2016 any further development is on-hold.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/disney-looks-to-pokemon-go-technology-as-playmation-sales-disappoint-1470347143|Disney Looks to ‘Pokémon Go’ Technology as Playmation Sales Disappoint&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ProductiveMuslim''' is a [[International|multinational]] virtual organisation and a website that specialises in providing materials for the [[Muslim]] [[Ummah]] combining teachings of [[Islam]] with contemporary [[productivity]] tips and advice.&lt;ref name="dinar"/&gt; ProductiveMuslim is managed by an international team of [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s from different countries. These include [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Egypt]] and [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name = "about"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://productivemuslim.com/about |title= About - ProductiveMuslim |publisher= ProductiveMuslim |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ProductiveMuslim.com started as a personal online journal for Mohammed Faris, the founder, where he recorded his thoughts on topics that connect [[Islam]] to productivity. Over time, Faris found that when properly practiced, Islam leads to a productive lifestyle.&lt;ref name="gulf2"/&gt; In July 2008, the website was launched.&lt;ref name="dinar"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dinarstandard.com/productivity-in-ramadan-study-acknowledgement/ |title=Productivity in Ramadan Study: Acknowledgement |publisher= Dinar Standard |date=August 23, 2011 |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of an international team of [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s, the website grew and its content improved over time. In July 2011, ProductiveMuslim was registered as a company under the name ''ProductiveMuslim [[Private company limited by shares|Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12044859-the-very-best-of-productive-muslim |title=The Very Best of ProductiveMuslim by Abu Productive |publisher= Goodreads |year=2010 |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founder===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mohammed Faris (ProductiveMuslim).jpg|thumb|160px|right|Mohammed Faris, founder]] --&gt;

Faris is also the founder of [[ProductiveMuslim.com]] - a popular lifestyle blog for Muslims - and author of the
book “[http://www.productivemuslimbook.com The Productive Muslim: Where Faith Meets Productivity”]. He did his bachelors and masters in the [[UK]], and formerly worked as [[Risk Management]] Specialist in the [[Islamic Development Bank]].&lt;ref name="saudilife"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.saudilife.net/life-and-society/84-personalities/29738-wake-up-early-says-founder-of-productive-muslim |title='Wake Up Early,' says Founder of ProductiveMuslim - Saudi Life |work= Saudi Life |date=October 30, 2012 |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pyrocollodion''' is a [[smokeless powder]] invented by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]].

== History ==
[[Dmitri Mendeleev]] discovered Pyrocollodion in 1892 and proposed its use  as a replacement for [[gunpowder]] in the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian Navy]]. This offer was rejected because of cost and efficiency.  

== Functionality ==
Pyrocollodion is known to be [[spontaneous combustion|spontaneously combustible]], and [[explosive material|explosive]].

When ignited Pyrocollodion will burn and explode quickly with excessive heat output compared to the existing gunpoweders of the time. Pyrocollodion was a reasonable choice or option at the time for military munitions use. 

If ignited in a tight contained space, Pyrocollodion will leave little to no remnants, such as unburned powder, particular kinds of flame scarring, or smoke of any kind.

== Chemistry == 
Pyrocollodion is a variant of [[nitrocellulose]] family of compunds.

'''Sevici''' is a [[community bicycle program]] in [[Seville]] inaugurated in April 2007, modeled after the [[Vélo'v]] service in [[Lyon]] and [[Vélib']] in [[Paris]]. Its purpose is to cover the small and medium daily routes within the city in a [[Sustainable transport|climate friendly]] way, almost without pollution (specially the emission of finest [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate]] matter), [[roadway noise]], [[traffic congestion]] and to reclaim the urban streets with [[Human-powered transport|non-polluting vehicles]].
==Operation==
The [https://web.archive.org/web/20081227014526/http://www.sevilla.org/impe/sevilla/portada Ayuntamiento de Sevilla] (Municipal Government) and [[JCDecaux]] manage and maintain the system. Two membership options are available; a weekly pass, purchasable at each of the station kiosks by credit card at a cost of 13.33 euros, and a yearly pass, requiring an application to be sent to the municipal government at a cost of 33.33 euros . Before the end of 2008 more than 250 stations and 2500 bikes will be available. The stations are situated throughout the inner-city with a distance of around 200 metres between each one, with many situated next to public transport stops to allow for [[Intermodal passenger transport|intermodal use]]. The bikes can be borrowed from, and returned to, any station in the system, making it suitable for one way travel. Each station has between 10 and 40 parking slots to fix and lock the bicycle.

To borrow a bike with a yearly pass, one simply swipes the contactless [[RFID]]-card at a station kiosk to be personally identified by the system, which then unlocks a bike from the support frame. With a weekly pass, a ticket is printed with an ID number that can be punched in at the station kiosks to identify the user account.  Bicycles can be used for the first 30 minutes for free; the next 30 minutes are 1.03 euro. Subsequent hours are 2.04 euros. Hourly rates are discounted for the yearly pass. To return a bicycle one simply places the bike in a spare slot at a station, the bike is recognized automatically and is locked into place.

== Subscription==
The yearly subscription costing 33.33 euros requires an address where the pass is sent, whereas the weekly alternative (13.33 euros) can be obtained directly at any station by presenting a credit card. In both cases a 150 euro deposit is authorized in order to deter theft. (If a debit card is used, the 150 euros will be taken immediately and returned at the end of the hire period.)

When a weekly membership is purchased the user is provided with a member code ticket to be used at the stations rather than an [[RFID]] card, making the service immediately available to tourists.

'''Social simulation''' is a research field that applies [[computer|computational]] methods to study issues in the [[social sciences]]. The issues explored include problems in [[computational law]], [[psychology]],&lt;ref name="Hughes et al (2012) JOOP"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = H. P.

Social simulation aims to cross the gap between the descriptive approach used in the social sciences and the formal approach used in the natural sciences, by moving the focus on the processes/mechanisms/behaviors that build the social reality.

In social simulation, computers support human reasoning activities by executing these mechanisms. This field explores the simulation of societies as [[complex system|complex non-linear systems]], which are difficult to study with classical mathematical equation-based models. [[Robert Axelrod]] regards social simulation as a third way of doing science, differing from both the deductive and inductive approach; generating data that can be analysed inductively, but coming from a rigorously specified set of rules rather than from direct measurement of the real world. Thus, simulating a phenomenon is akin to generating it—constructing artificial societies. These ambitious aims have encountered [[#Criticisms|several criticisms]].

The social simulation approach to the social sciences is promoted and coordinated by three regional associations, [[European Social Simulation Association|ESSA]] for Europe, North America (reorganizing under the new CSSS name), and PAAA [https://archive.is/20130413115754/http://www.paaa.econ.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ Pacific Asia].

==History and development==

The history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the [[Self-replicating machine|Von Neumann machine]], a theoretical machine capable of reproducing itself. The device [[von Neumann]] proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then improved by von Neumann's friend [[Stanislaw Ulam]], also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up&amp;mdash;creating the first of devices later termed [[cellular automata]].

Another improvement was brought by mathematician, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]. He constructed the well-known [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]. Unlike the von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated by simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional [[checkerboard]].

The birth of the agent-based model as a model for social systems was primarily brought about by a computer scientist, [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]]. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as the [[artificial life]], a term coined by [[Christopher Langton]].

[[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] developed the first large scale agent model, the [[Sugarscape]], to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, transmission of disease, and even culture.

[[Kathleen M. Carley]] published "Computational Organizational Science and Organizational Engineering" defining the movement of simulation into
organizations, established a journal for social simulation applied to organizations and complex socio-technical systems: [[Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory]], and was the founding president of the North American Association of Computational Social and Organizational Systems that morphed into the current CSSSA.

[[Nigel Gilbert]] published with [[Klaus G. Troitzsch]] the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the Social Scientist (1999) and established its most relevant journal: the [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]].

More recently, [[Ron Sun]] developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as [[cognitive social simulation]] (see {{Harv|Sun|2006}})

==Topics==

Here are some sample topics that have been explored with social simulation:

* '''[[norm (social)|Social norms]]''': [[Robert Axelrod]] has used simulations to investigate the foundation of morality;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Axelrod (1986): [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~axe/Axelrod%20Norms%20APSR%201986%20(2).pdf An Evolutionary Approach to Norms]&lt;/ref&gt; others have modeled the emergence of norms using [[meme]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Felix Flentge, Daniel Polani and Thomas Uthmann (2001) [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/4/4/3.html Modelling the Emergence of Possession Norms using Memes]&lt;/ref&gt; or how social norms and emotions can regulate each other.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Staller and Paolo Petta (2001): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/4/1/2.html Introducing Emotions into the Computational Study of Social Norms: A First Evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Martin Neumann (2008): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/11/4/6.html Homo Socionicus: a Case Study of Simulation Models of Norms] for an overview of the recent (as of 2008) research.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of simulation and modeling==
Social simulation can refer to a general class of strategies for understanding social dynamics using computers to simulate social systems. Social simulation allows for a more systematic way of viewing the possibilities of outcomes.

There are four major types of social simulation: 
#System level simulation.
#System level modeling.
#Agent-based simulation.
#Agent-based modeling.

A social simulation may fall within the rubric of [[computational sociology]] which is a recently developed branch of [[sociology]] that uses [[computation]] to analyze social phenomena. The basic premise of computational sociology is to take advantage of [[computer simulation]]s {{Harv|Polhill|Edmonds|2007}} in the construction of social theories. It involves the understanding of [[social agent]]s, the interaction among these agents, and the effect of these interactions on the social aggregate.  Although the subject matter and methodologies in [[social science]] differ from those in [[natural science]] or [[computer science]], several of the approaches used in contemporary social [[simulation]] originated from fields such as [[physics]] and [[artificial intelligence]].

===System level simulation===
System Level Simulation (SLS) is the oldest level of social simulation. System level simulation looks at the situation as a whole. This theoretical outlook on social situations uses a wide range of information to determine what should happen to society and its members if certain variables are present. Therefore, with specific variables presented, society and its members should have a certain response to the new situation. Navigating through this theoretical simulation will allow researchers to develop educated ideas of what will happen under some specific variables.

For example, if [[NASA]] were to conduct a system level simulation it would benefit the organization by providing a cost effective research method to navigate through the simulation. This allows the researcher to steer through the virtual possibilities of the given simulation and develop [[safety]] procedures, and to produce proven facts about how a certain situation will play out. {{Harv|National Research|2006}}

===System level modeling===

System level modeling (SLM) aims to specifically predict (unlike system level simulation's generalization in prediction) and convey any number of actions, behaviors, or other theoretical possibilities of nearly any person, object, construct et cetera within a system using a large set of mathematical equations and computer programming in the form of models.

A model is a representation of a specific thing ranging from objects and people to structures and products created through mathematical equations and are designed, using computers, in such a way that they are able to stand-in as the aforementioned things in a study. Models can be either simplistic or complex, depending on the need for either; however, models are intended to be simpler than what they are representing while remaining realistically similar in order to be used accurately. They are built using a collection of data that is translated into computing languages that allow them to represent the system in question. These models, much like simulations, are used to help us better understand specific roles and actions of different things so as to predict behavior and the like.

===Agent-based simulation===

[[Agent-based social simulation]] (ABSS) consists of modeling different societies after artificial agents, (varying on scale) and placing them in a computer simulated society to observe the behaviors of the agents.  From this data it is possible to learn about the reactions of the artificial agents and translate them into the results of non-artificial agents and simulations.  Three main fields in ABSS are agent-based computing, social science, and computer simulation.

Agent-based computing is the design of the model and agents, while the computer simulation is the part of the simulation of the agents in the model and the outcomes.  The social science is a mixture of sciences and social part of the model.  It is where the social phenomena is developed and theorized. The main purpose of ABSS is to provide models and tools for agent-based simulation of social phenomena.  With ABSS we can explore different outcomes for phenomena where we might not be able to view the outcome in real life.  It can provide us valuable information on society and the outcomes of social events or phenomena.

===Agent-based modeling===

[[Agent-based modeling]] (ABM) is a system in which a collection of agents independently interact on networks. Each individual agent is responsible for different behaviors that result in collective behaviors. These behaviors as a whole help to define the workings of the network. ABM focuses on human social interactions and how people work together and communicate with one another without having one, single "group mind". This essentially means that it tends to focus on the consequences of interactions between people (the agents) in a population. Researchers are better able to understand this type of modeling by modeling these dynamics on a smaller, more localized level. Essentially, ABM helps to better understand interactions between people (agents) who, in turn, influence one another (in response to these influences). Simple individual rules or actions can result in coherent [[group behavior]]. Changes in these individual acts can affect the collective group in any given population.

Agent-based modeling is an experimental tool for theoretical research. It enables one to deal with more complex individual behaviors, such as adaptation. Overall, through this type of modeling, the creator, or researcher, aims to model behavior of agents and the communication between them in order to better understand how these individual interactions impact an entire population. In essence, ABM is a way of modeling and understanding different global patterns.

==Current research==

There are several current research projects that relate directly to modeling and agent-based simulation the following are listed below with a brief overview.

*"Generative e-Social Science for Socio-Spatial Simulation" or (GENESIS) is a research node of the UK National Centre for e-Social Science funded by the UK research council [http://www.esrc.ac.uk ESRC]. For further details please see: [https://web.archive.org/web/20091209031009/http://www.genesis.ucl.ac.uk/ GENESIS Web Page] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20091114023426/http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/genesisblog/ Blog].
*"National e-Infrastructure for Social Simulation" or (NeISS) is a UK-based project funded by [http://www.jisc.ac.uk JISC]. For further details please see: [http://www.neiss.org.uk The NeISS Web Pages].
*"Network Models Governance and R&amp;D collaboration networks" or (N.E.M.O) is a research centre whose main focus is to identify ways to create and to assess desirable network structures for typical functions; (e.g. knowledge, creation, transfer, and distribution.) This research will ultimately aid [[policy-makers]] at all political levels in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of network-based policy instruments at promoting the knowledge economy in Europe.
*"Agent-based Simulations of Market and Consumer Behavior" is another research group that is funded by the Unilever Corporate Research. The current research that is being conducted is investigating the usefulness of agent-based simulations for modeling [[consumer behavior]] and to show the potential value and insights it can add to long-established marketing methods.
*"New and Emergent World Models Through Individual, Evolutionary and Social Learning" or (New Ties) is a three-year project that will ultimately create a virtual society developed by agent-based simulation. The project will develop a simulated society capable of exploring the environment and developing its own image of this environment and the society through interaction. The goal of the research project is for the simulated society to exhibit [[individual learning]], [[evolutionary learning]] and [[social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]].
*Bruch and Mare's project on neighborhood [[Residential segregation|segregation]]: The purpose of the study is to figure out the reasoning for neighborhood segregation based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and to figure out the [[tipping point (sociology)|tipping point]] or when people become uncomfortable with the integration levels into their neighborhood, and decide to flee from the neighborhood. They set up a model using flash cards, and put the agent's house in the middle and put houses of different races surrounding the agent's house. They asked people how comfortable they would feel with different situations; if they were okay with one situation, they asked another until the neighborhood was fully integrated. Bruch and Mare's results showed that the tipping point was at 50%. When a neighborhood became 50% minority and 50% white, people of both races began to become uncomfortable and [[white flight]] began to rise. The use of agent-based modeling showed how useful it can be in the world of sociology, people did not have to answer why they would become uncomfortable, just which situation they were uncomfortable with.
*The MAELIA Program (Multi-Agent Emergent Norms Assessment) is a project dealing with the relationships between the users and managers of a natural resource, in that case water, and the related norms and laws that are to be built within them (conventions) or are imposed to them by other actors (institutions). The purpose of the project is to build a generic multiscale platform which is planned to deal with [[water conflict]]-related issues.
*The [http://www.gsi.dit.upm.es/mosi/ Mosi-Agil project] is a four-year program funded by the Autonomous Region of Madrid through the program MOSI-AGIL-CM (grant S2013/ICE-3019, co-funded by EU Structural Funds FSE and FEDER). It aims at creating a body of knowledge and practical tools which are necessary to handle more effectively the behavior of occupants of large facilities. Therefore, the project studies the development of ambient intelligence and intelligent environments supported by the use of Agent-Based Social Simulation.

Agent-based modeling is most useful in providing a bridge between micro and macro levels, which is a large part of what sociology studies. Agent-based models are most appropriate for studying processes that lack central coordination, including the emergence of institutions that, once established, impose order from the top down. The models focus on how simple and predictable local interactions generate familiar but highly detailed global patterns, such as emergence of [[norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[participation (decision making)|participation]] of collective action. Michael W. Macy and Robert Willer researched a recent survey of applications and found that there were two main problems with agent-based modeling the [[self-organization]] of social structure and the [[emergence]] of [[social order]] {{Harv|Macy|Willer|2002}}. Below is a brief description of each problem Macy and Willer believe there to be;
#"''Emergent structure''. In these models, agents change location or behavior in response to [[social influences]] or selection pressures. Agents may start out undifferentiated and then change location or behavior so as to avoid becoming different or isolated (or in some cases, overcrowded). Rather than producing homogeneity, however, these conformist decisions aggregate to produce global patterns of cultural differentiation, stratification, and homophilic clustering in local networks. Other studies reverse the process, starting with a heterogeneous population and ending in convergence: the coordination, diffusion, and sudden collapse of norms, conventions, innovations, and technological standards."
#"''Emergent social order''. These studies show how [[egotism|egoistic]] adaptation can lead to successful collective action without either altruism or global (top down) imposition of control. A key finding across numerous studies is that the viability of trust, cooperation, and collective action depends decisively on the embeddedness of interaction."

These examples simply show the complexity of our environment and that agent-based models are designed to explore the minimal conditions, the simplest set of assumptions about human behavior, required for a given social phenomenon to emerge at a higher level of organization.

==Criticisms==
Since its creation, computerized social simulation has been the target of some criticism in regard to its practicality and accuracy. Social simulation's simplification of the complex to form models from which we can better understand the latter is sometimes seen as a draw back, as using fairly simple models to simulate real life with computers is not always the best way to predict behavior.

Most of the criticism seems to be aimed at agent-based models and simulation and how they work:

#Simulations, being man-made from mathematical interfaces, predict [[human behavior]] in a far too simple manner in regard to the complexities of humanity and our actions.
#Simulations cannot enlighten researchers as to how people interact or behave in ways not programmed into their models. For this reason, the scope of simulations are limited in that the researchers must already know what they are going to find (to a degree, for they cannot find anything they themselves did not place in the model) at least vaguely, possibly skewing the results.
#Due to the complexities of what is being measured, simulations must be analyzed in unbiased ways; however, with the model running on a pre-made set of instructions coded into it by a modeler, biases exist almost universally.
#It is highly difficult and often impractical to attempt to link the findings from the abstract world the simulation creates and our complex society and all of its variation.

Researchers working in social simulation might respond that the competing theories from the [[social sciences]] are far simpler than those achieved through simulation and therefore suffer the aforementioned drawbacks much more strongly.  Theories in some social science tend to be linear models that are not dynamic, and are generally inferred from small laboratory [[experiment]]s (laboratory tests are most common in psychology but rare in sociology, political science, economics and geography). The behavior of populations of agents under these models is rarely tested or verified against empirical observation.

'''''Sophie's World''''' is a 1997 educational adventure game developed by The MultiMedia Corporation and published by Voyager. it is an adaption of the novel [[Sophie's World]], written by Norwegian writer Jostein Gaarder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/Sophies_World/Sophie.shtm|title=Review:|date=2001-08-09|access-date=2018-02-24|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010809001410/http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/Sophies_World/Sophie.shtm|archivedate=2001-08-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The game was developed by a small team of 6-7 core MAC developers and Win32 developers, 1 lead graphic designer, and producers, as well as contract workers. The scenes, audio, and timelines were collaborated between the departments.  Sam Deane created a game engine from scratch to present the scenes. Simon Jenkins wrote the natural language engine for the in-game instant message application. The writing was aided by academics of philosophy to ensure realism and accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyWIRwOuyR0&amp;lc=UghCUYBmqCFInXgCoAEC|title=Conversation between developers Alan McAuley, Simon Jenkins, and Sam Deane in the comments section of a YouTube Letsplay of their game|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot and gameplay ==
The player explores philosophical concepts through the eyes of the 14 year old Sophie. The title contains an in-game encyclopaedic database.

== Critical reception ==
Ray Ivey of Just Adventure described it as short, imaginative, and delicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/Sophies_World/Sophie.shtm|title=Review:|date=2001-08-09|access-date=2018-02-24|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010809001410/http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/Sophies_World/Sophie.shtm|archivedate=2001-08-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quandaryland's Steve Ramsey wrote that while the game only took an hor to complete, he didn't have a desire to stay in the world for longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quandaryland.com/jsp/dispArticle.jsp?index=497|title=Sophie's World Review by Quandary|date=2007-06-08|access-date=2018-02-24|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608102108/http://www.quandaryland.com/jsp/dispArticle.jsp?index=497|archivedate=2007-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1997 Bima Awards, the British Interactive Multimedia Association presented the game with a craft award for sound and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/winners-of1997-bima-awards-announced-1256332.html|title=Winners of1997 Bima awards announced|date=1997-06-17|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainable/ Industrial/ Recycled furniture design''' is an effort to address the [[environmental impact]] of [[furniture]] products on the environment by considering all aspects of the design and [[manufacturing]] process. Design considerations can include using [[recycle]]d materials in the manufacturing process and using products that can be disassembled and recycled after their useful life. Sustainable furniture design strives to create a closed-loop cycle in which materials and products are perpetually recycled so as to avoid disposal in [[landfill]]s. The Think Chair by [[Steelcase]] is a recent example of sustainable furniture design.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10145">'''Title 21 CFR Part 11''' is the part of [[Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations|Title 21]] of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] that establishes the United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulations on electronic records and [[electronic signature]]s (ERES). '''Part 11''', as it is commonly called, defines the criteria under which electronic records and electronic signatures are considered trustworthy, reliable, and equivalent to paper records (Title 21 CFR Part 11 Section 11.1 (a)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=11.1|website=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration|publisher=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage==
Practically speaking, Part 11 applies to [[Pharmaceutical company|drug makers]], [[medical device]] manufacturers, [[Biotechnology|biotech]] companies, [[biologic medical product|biologics]] developers, [[Contract research organization|CROs]], and other FDA-regulated industries, with some specific exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food and Drug Administration CFR Title 21 Part 11|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Compliance/FDA#|website=Microsoft|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires that they implement controls, including audits, system validations, [[audit trail]]s, electronic signatures, and documentation for software and [[Computer system|systems]] involved in processing the electronic data that FDA predicate rules require them to maintain. A predicate rule is any requirement set forth in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, or any FDA regulation other than Part 11. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures — Scope and Application|url=http://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm125067.htm|website=U.S Food &amp; Drug Administration|publisher=U.S Food &amp; Drug Administration|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule also applies to submissions made to the FDA in electronic format (e.g., a [[New Drug Application]]) but not to paper submissions by electronic methods (i.e., [[fax]]es).  It specifically does not require the 21CFR11 requirement for record retention for tracebacks by food manufacturers.  Most food manufacturers are not otherwise explicitly required to keep detailed records, but electronic documentation kept for [[HACCP]] and similar requirements must meet these requirements.

Broad sections of the regulation have been challenged as "very expensive and for some applications almost impractical",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=21 CFR Part 11 -  Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures|url=http://www.labcompliance.com/tutorial/part11/default.aspx?sm=d_c|website=Lab Compliance|publisher=Lab Compliance|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the FDA has stated in guidance that it will exercise enforcement discretion on many parts of the rule.  This has led to confusion on exactly what is required, and the rule is being revised. In practice, the requirements on access controls are the only part routinely enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of Biometrics  in Enterprise Security|url=http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/power/ps1q06-20050132-Tilton-OE.pdf|website=Dell|publisher=Dell|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "predicate rules" that required organizations to keep records the first place are still in effect. If electronic records are illegible, inaccessible, or corrupted, manufacturers are still subject to those requirements.

If a regulated firm keeps "hard copies" of all required records, those paper documents can be considered the authoritative document for regulatory purposes, and the computer system is not in scope for electronic records requirements—though systems that control processes subject to predicate rules still require validation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures — Scope and Application|url=http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm125067.htm#iiic|website=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration|publisher=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Firms should be careful to make a claim that the "hard copy" of required records is the authoritative document. For the "hard copy" produced from electronic source to be the authoritative document, it must be a complete and accurate copy of the electronic source. The manufacturer must use the hard copy (rather than electronic versions stored in the system) of the records for regulated activities. The current technical architecture of computer systems increasingly makes the Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures — Scope and Application for the complete and accurate copy requirement extremely high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/SCRIPTs/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=11&amp;showFR=1|website=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration|publisher=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audit Trails: Patterns and Part 11 Compliance|url=http://www.solabs.com/audit-trails-patterns-part-11-compliance/|website=SOLABS|publisher=SOLABS|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various keynote speeches by FDA insiders early in the 21st century (in addition to high-profile audit findings focusing on computer system compliance) resulted in many companies scrambling to mount a defense against rule enforcement that they were procedurally and technologically unprepared for.  Many software and instrumentation vendors released Part 11 "compliant" updates that were either incomplete or insufficient to fully comply with the rule. Complaints about the wasting of critical resources, non-value added aspects, in addition to confusion within the drug, medical device, biotech/biologic and other industries about the true scope and enforcement aspects of Part 11 resulted in the FDA release of:
 
* [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm125125.pdf FDA Guidance for Industry Part 11, Electronic Records: Electronic Signatures – Scope and Application (2003)]
This document was intended to clarify how Part 11 should be implemented and would be enforced.  But, as with all FDA guidances, it was not intended to convey the full force of law—rather, it expressed the FDA's "current thinking" on Part 11 compliance.  Many within the industry, while pleased with the more limited scope defined in the guidance, complained that, in some areas, the 2003 guidance contradicted requirements in the 1997 Final Rule.
* [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM070266.pdf Guidance for Industry Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Investigations]
In May 2007, the FDA issued the final version of their guidance on computerized systems in clinical investigations. This guidance supersedes the guidance of the same name dated April 1999; and supplements the guidance for industry on Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures — Scope and Application and the Agency’s international harmonization efforts when applying these guidances to source data generated at clinical study sites.

FDA had previously announced that a new Part 11 would be released late 2006.  The Agency has since pushed that release date back.  The FDA has not announced a revised time of release.  John Murray, member of the Part 11 Working Group (the team at FDA developing the new Part 11), has publicly stated that the timetable for release is "flexible".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2651">'''Wide Area GPS Enhancement''' (WAGE) is a method to increase the horizontal accuracy of the [[GPS]] encrypted [[GPS signals|P(Y) Code]] by adding additional range correction data to the satellite broadcast navigation message.

Per a 1997 article, the navigation message for each satellite is updated once daily or as needed. This daily update of each satellite navigation message contains the range corrections for all the satellites in the constellation. Thus, more timely range correction information would be available for each satellite, resulting in increased horizontal accuracy. Potential improvements to the system include simplifying the upload procedure, uploading the data more often, and adding more monitor stations for better range correction.

WAGE is available only to the Precise Positioning Service (PPS) or P(Y) Code receivers. It requires at least 12.5 minutes to obtain the most recent WAGE data. After that, the process of using the corrections data is automatic and transparent to the operator. Any time the receiver is on, it continually collects WAGE data (whether the WAGE mode is on or off). The receiver always uses the most recent WAGE data available to calculate position and it will not use the data that is over 6 hours old.

A 1996 evaluation using a [[PLGR]] (a 5-channel L2 GPS receiver) found no clear advantage to using WAGE in its then-current configuration. Its overall average error of 9.1 meters was worse than when WAGE was not used. 

However, the specifications information for the [[Defense Advanced GPS Receiver]], which has replaced the PLGR, lists its WAGE accuracy as better than 4.82 m, 95% Horizontal. PPS accuracy has improved beyond WAGE specification and accuracy improvement from WAGE is now negligible. Modern receivers &amp; atomic clocks on a chip will also outperform WAGE. Some theorize that restrictions imposed by WAGE may limit precision for both C/A, P(Y), &amp; WAGE users more than what it provides to WAGE users only.

The capability of WAGE has been superseded by Talon NAMATH. There is a push for WAGE users to upgrade to Talon NAMATH or move them to using P(Y) alone. This could lift WAGE restrictions &amp; allow accuracy improvements for all users.
