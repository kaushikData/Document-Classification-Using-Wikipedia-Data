      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1905">The '''Act of Settlement''' of 1703 (passed in 1704) was an [[Act of Tynwald]] passed clarifying the status of the population of the [[Isle of Man]]. It has been referred to as a Manx [[Magna Carta]] as its aim was to preserve the rights of the peasants in relation to their Lord. In the 16th century, tenants on the Isle had begun to consider their estates as their own but at the end of that century restrictions began to be enforced. An ordinance in 1582 stated that lands were not to be alienated (bought and sold, or left in wills) except by the Lord's license, which came with a fine. This was repealed in 1608 but reimposed in 1645. This situation was not popular among tenants who found themselves losing rights they had previously considered their own. By the last quarter of the century alienation fines were being successfully imposed. These fines made it difficult for tenants to get by and many had to abandon their land. This situation could not continue and in 1703 Bishop Wilson travelled to speak with the Earl on behalf of the tenants with a view to settling the issue. The Earl agreed to restore to his tenants their ancestral estates and impose significantly smaller fines (a third of the previous levels) and, in the case of inheritance, to allow a year for these fines to be paid. The Act was re-enacted in 1777 after [[revestment (Isle of Man)|revestment]], and is today considered the foundation of the Island's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/hist1900/ch70.htm Moore, Book 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1489">The '''Aye Formation''' is a [[geologic formation]] in the Dinant [[Synclinorium]], [[Belgium]]. It is part of the Condroz Group,&lt;ref name="Condroz"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ncs.naturalsciences.be/devonian/42-descriptions | title=Devonian—Descriptions | publisher=National Commission for Stratigraphy Belgium | work=Devonian | accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the base of the middle [[Famennian]] (Upper [[Devonian]]). It is characterized by the presence of a [[conodont]] fossil ''[[Palmatolepis]] rhomboidea''.&lt;ref name="StratBelg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ncs.naturalsciences.be/devonian/427-aye-formation-aye | title=Aye Formation | publisher=National Commission for Stratigraphy Belgium | work=Devonian | accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is composed mostly of greenish [[shale]]s and [[siltstone]]s with some lenses of [[sandstone]]. As it formed in an offshore position, in a subtidal wave-influenced environment, [[bioturbation]] features are significant. [[Cross-bedding]] structures also occur.&lt;ref name="StratBelg" /&gt;

The [[stratotype]] is located in the area of [[Houyet]] and [[Aye (village)|Aye]] in Belgium.&lt;ref name="StratBelg" /&gt;

The '''Battle of Örlygsstaðir''' was a historic battle fought by the [[Sturlungar]] against the [[Ásbirningar]] and the [[Haukdælir]] clans in northern [[Iceland]]. The battle was part of the civil war that was taking place in Iceland at the time between various powerful clans during the time known as the [[Age of the Sturlungs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|author=    
|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Battle of Örlygsstaðir was fought on 21 August 1238 between [[Sighvatur Sturluson]] (brother of [[Snorri Sturluson]]) and his son [[Sturla Sighvatsson]] on the one hand, and [[Kolbeinn Arnórsson|Kolbeinn ungi]] and [[Gissur Þorvaldsson]] (later Earl Gissur) on the other. Sighvatur had nearly 500 men but there no evidence available of the size of Sturla's following.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nonetheless, historians estimate that the Sturlungar had a total of 1000 men.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chieftains and Power in the Icelandic Commonwealth|last = Sigurðsson|first = Jón Viðar|publisher = |year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = 81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gissur and Kolbeinn had almost 1700 men in total.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The areas controlled by the Sturlungar were more populous but the settlements were more scattered which made it difficult for the Sturlungar to assemble fighting men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Ásbirningar and Haukdælir clans emerged victorious after a short battle.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The History of Iceland|last = Karlsson|first = Gunnar|publisher = |year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = 80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 50 men were killed on that day,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; including Sighvatur and Sturla. According to Saga of the Icelanders, Gissur only lost seven men whereas Kolbeinn lost none.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Five others, including [[Þórir Jökull Steinfinnsson]], were executed by beheading following the battle. The names of those who perished on that day are recorded in the ''[[Íslendinga saga]]'' which is included as a part of the ''[[Sturlunga saga]]''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.northwest.is/1sogulegirstadir2.asp#hauganes ''Örlygsstaðir'' (Historical Places in Northwest Iceland)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 a memorial was raised on the site of the battle, which describes the battle.

He became famous in Norway in connection with the ''Baasland case'' in the autumn of 2008, when it was revealed that he had [[Problem gambling|gambled]] away almost {{NOK|60 million}} (more than €7 million) that he borrowed from family friends and banks.&lt;ref name="Norway 2008a"&gt;{{cite web |last=Norway |first=Aftenposten |title=Baasland lost a fortune gambling - Aftenposten.no |website=aftenposten.no |date=2008-10-20 |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2659341.ece |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020090928/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2659341.ece |archive-date=2008-10-20 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the son of [[Ernst Baasland]], who at the time was a [[Diocese of Stavanger|Bishop of Stavanger]] in the [[Church of Norway]].

'''Black Cross Nurses''' (officially the '''Universal African Black Cross Nurses''') is an international organization of nurses which was founded in 1920, based upon the model of the [[Red Cross]]. The organization was the women's auxiliary of the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]] and was established to provide health services and education to people of African descent.

==History==
In 1920, [[Henrietta Vinton Davis]] established the Black Cross Nurses (BCN) in [[Philadelphia]] as an auxiliary of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA). The BCN served as the women's auxiliary of the UNIA, placing women in a supportive role, while the men's auxiliary served in a protective role.{{sfn|Summers|2005|p=137}} [[Marcus Garvey]] wanted everyone in the UNIA to feel they belonged within the organization, and the BCN served that purpose for women.{{sfn|Haskins|Tate|Cox|Wilkinson|2003|p=117}}

The BCN was based on the [[World War I]] nursing model of the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]]. Local chapters were established with a matron, head nurse, secretary and treasurer to provide health services and hygiene education to black members of the community.{{sfn|Keller|Ruether|Cantlon|2006|p=1078}} Few programs existed which would admit people of African descent into nursing training at the time and many health facilities provided unequal care to black patrons;{{sfn|Duncan|2009|p=134}} one of the goals of the organization was addressing these discrepancies. Doctors, nurses and lay practitioners took courses ranging from six months to a year to make sure that standardized care was being given. In addition, upon graduation from the course, each member was required to purchase and wear their official uniform.{{sfn|Duncan|2009|p=135}}

In many ways, the organization functioned as a social reform movement, while developing role models for young women.{{sfn|Franklin|2001|p=97}} It promoted education, good health and hygiene, juvenile rehabilitation, maternal and infant care,{{sfn|Macpherson|2007|p=74}} and training in proper nutrition. It also provided a professional, organized structure for members,{{sfn|Duncan|2009|p=136}} giving them a means to appear in roles of public leadership.{{sfn|Macpherson|2007|p=75}} In articles which appeared in the ''[[Negro World]]'', nurses addressed a wide variety of topics from advice to expectant mothers to contagious diseases, heart disease, and hygiene, as well as descriptions of the conditions, symptoms, and treatment options.{{sfn|Duncan|2009|p=152}} Benevolent community service{{sfn|Garvey|1987|p=362}} included distributing clothing and food to those in need.{{sfn|Franklin|2001|p=97}}

The requirements of membership were that the women be active members of the UNIA, between 15 and 45 years old and "of Negro blood and African descent".&lt;ref name=UNIA-ACL&gt;{{cite web|title=Auxillaries{{sic|hide=y}}|url=http://www.theunia-acl.com/index.php/auxillaries |publisher=The Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|accessdate=28 January 2016|location=Cleveland, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nurses were also required to be able to read and write in order to promote literacy in their communities and serve as examples to others.{{sfn|Duncan|2009|p=140}} As an overriding goal, the organization used social health concerns to uplift the black race from degeneracy, believing that by creating a sanitary living environment, the community would prosper.{{sfn|Macpherson|2007|pp=87–89}} Units quickly formed in cities across the United States, as well as in [[Caribbean|The Caribbean]] and [[Central America]].&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|title=People &amp; Events: Women in the Garvey Movement|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/garvey/peopleevents/e_womenunia.html|website=[[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]]|publisher=American Experience|accessdate=28 January 2016|date=1999–2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1920s, the United States UNIA organizations spread into thirty-eight states,&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Leeuwen|first1=David|title=Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/twenty/tkeyinfo/garvey.htm|publisher=National Humanities Center|accessdate=30 January 2016|location=Research Triangle Park, North Carolina|date=October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and membership in the Black Cross Nurses was in the tens of thousands.{{sfn|Duncan|2009|p=127}} The largest branch in the world was located in [[Harlem]].{{sfn|Hammett|Hammett|2012|p=69}} Within a few years of the formal organization of the Black Cross Nurses, there were chapters in Alabama,{{sfn|Duncan|2009|p=137}} Chicago, California, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia,{{sfn|Duncan|2009|p=137}} with international chapters in [[Belize]],{{sfn|Macpherson|2007|pp=75, 91}} [[Nova Scotia]], [[Panama]],{{sfn|Duncan|2009|p=137}} [[Trinidad and Tobago]].{{sfn|Martin|1984|p=78}} By 1927, membership had declined, but the Black Cross Nurses provided education for African-American nurses and health care access to African Americans in their communities through the 1960s.{{sfn|Duncan|2009|p=159}}

==Culture==
All white uniforms including dress, shoes, stockings and a cap adorned with a black cross encircled by a red background with a green center were worn for dress and official functions. Duty uniforms, consisted of a green dress over which was worn an ivory apron accompanied by black shoes and stockings, set the BCN nurses apart from other nurses and united them as symbolically as members. Green was chosen as a representation of growth and renewal.{{sfn|Duncan|2009|pp=145–146}} Criticism of the dress and cape stemmed from a comparison to a nun's habit, while UNIA men's uniforms resembled military attire.{{sfn|Franklin|2001|p=97}}

Ancillary responsibilities of the BCN included singing in a choir and marching in parades. Choir rehearsals were on Friday. Marching practice was necessary as local chapters participated in parades on holidays such as Memorial Day and the Fourth of July,{{sfn|Taylor|Moore|2003|p=205}} sometimes carrying the [[Pan-African flag|Black Nationalist flag]].{{sfn|Wiggins|1990|p=95}}

==International chapters==

===Belize===
The Belize Black Cross Nurses organization was established in [[British Honduras]] in 1920 by [[Vivian Seay]], who led the organization until her death in 1971.{{sfn|Macpherson|2007|p=91}} Dr. K. Simon, medical officer for the Cayo District, moved to [[Belize City|Belize Town]] in 1921, and began instructing members of the UNIA in midwifery, to combat the high mortality rates for infants and mothers. He urged that members take instruction under Belize Town Public Hospital matron Lois M. Roberts, an Englishwoman, in general hospital procedures and hygiene.  As Roberts had been unable to secure sufficient nurses for her training program, she agreed to accept the Black Cross Nurses.{{sfn|Macpherson|2007|pp=93–94}} By 1922, seventeen of the first training class of twenty nurses passed their exams and were awarded their nursing certificates. By 1923, there were twenty-four certified nurses, who were each assigned a territory in Belize Town to administer to the needs of the poor, as unpaid volunteers.{{sfn|Macpherson|2007|p=94}}

In the aftermath of the [[1931 Belize hurricane]], the Nurses helped in the Public Hospital and in relief camps. An annual event called the ''Baby Exhibition'', was a competition to award healthy infants in various age categories and display proper parenting to the populace. It was a popular event which consolidated the public perception of the nurses as professionals, since they chose the contestants, and the approval of the government, since the colonial medical authorities determined the winners.{{sfn|Macpherson|2003|p=515}} They also conducted studies and research on the health of communities,{{sfn|Macpherson|2003|p=516}} as well as humanitarian projects like the 1934 Palace Unemployed Women's Fund, aimed at providing groceries to unemployed mothers.{{sfn|Macpherson|2003|p=518}}

Seay, and thus the organization, were staunchly in opposition to [[universal suffrage]].{{sfn|Macpherson|2007|p=91}} On the one hand, they sought [[Victorian morality]] as a means to improve society as a whole and were rigidly opposed to the baser habits of the lower classes while on the other, they expanded women's spheres from within the [[Cult of Domesticity|confines of domesticity]].{{sfn|Macpherson|2007|p=91}} For the first time, middle-class black women, who were trained as nurses, were publicly active and held positions of community leadership.{{sfn|Macpherson|2007|p=75}} The attempts to control others' morality were not always appreciated{{sfn|Macpherson|2003|p=516}} and Seay's political involvement and party politics became divisive points, which reflected on the nurses.{{sfn|Macpherson|2003|p=520}} In the attempt to maintain order, Seay's policies excluded poor and working-class women, while at the same time strengthening middle-class Creole political worth.{{sfn|Macpherson|2003|p=522}}

Though the organization never came under government control, by 1952 the Black Cross Nurses had influenced the health policies of seven of the colonial governors of British Honduras.{{sfn|Macpherson|2003|p=514}} It was the most active and lasting black organization in the country,{{sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|p=420}} and though it lost momentum after Seay's death was revitalized in the 1980s and continues to serve the humanitarian needs of communities in which its members live.{{sfn|Williams|Buckley|2013|p=36}}

===Caribbean===
The Black Cross Nursing organizations of Cuba sprang up mostly in the areas which were highly influenced by [[British West Indies|British West Indians]] and in company towns like those that existed for the [[United Fruit Company]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2014|p=232}} The organization in [[Banes, Cuba]], was developed as an avenue to create acceptance and respectability for blacks, promoting [[pan-Africanism]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2014|p=246}} The organization thrived until 1932 when the combination of economic depression and rising Cuban Nationalism turned toward labor militancy and communism.{{sfn|Sullivan|2014|p=255}}

The Black Cross Nursing organization of [[Jamaica]] was organized in 1922. Sarah Grant, who had trained students at Victoria Jubilee Hospital, trained 29 nurses, though their training remained rudimentary and the organization was always a volunteer auxiliary which did not develop into a strong organization.&lt;ref name="Sarah Grant"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sarah Grant Dies|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/profile/susun-wilkinson/clipnumber/25865/|accessdate=30 January 2016|work=[[Gleaner Company|Kingston Gleaner]]' |date=13 January 1992|location=Kingston, Jamaica|page=18|via = [[Newspaperarchive.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BCN Jamaica"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Black Cross Nurse of Jamaica|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/profile/susun-wilkinson/clipnumber/25861/|accessdate=30 January 2016|work=Kingston Gleaner |date=13 May 1998|location=Kingston, Jamaica|page=11|via = [[Newspaperarchive.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, the Black Cross Nursing organized as a response to denial of black women's participation in [[World War I]] efforts to assist  wounded soldiers. The women organized to provide medical help including child care services, first aid, health care, nutrition education and other services.&lt;ref name=SEIU&gt;{{cite web|title=February is Black History Month|url=http://www.seiuhealthcare.ca/february_is_black_history_month|publisher=Service Employees International Union|accessdate=29 January 2016|location=Ontario, Canada|date=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 25% of the black population of Canada joined the Universal Negro Improvement Association of Canada and a high percentage of those members were of [[West Indian]] heritage,{{sfn|Marano|2010|p=234}} possibly due to the strong identification of people from the Caribbean with the British colour-class system: white rulers; brown, mixed-race middle class; and black, laboring lower class.{{sfn|Marano|2010|p=240}} However another important factor was the higher education level and political awareness of Caribbean-born immigrants compared with other black Canadians.{{sfn|Marano|2010|p=244}} West Indians who immigrated as a whole were ambitious and wanted to improve their communities.{{sfn|Marano|2010|pp=246–247}} The BCN organization served to reinforce these ideals, moving many black women away from traditional domestic work and labor and into universities, though not in Canada. The majority of Canadian higher education and hospital organizations refused training for black women, forcing them to look to traditional black colleges in the United States.{{sfn|Mathieu|2010|p=160}} The nurses were a vital part of providing health services to the black communities of Montreal,{{sfn|Mathieu|2010|p=158}} Ontario, Nova Scotia and other provinces. Throughout Canada, UNIA divisions were established in 32 cities and towns,{{sfn|Marano|2010|p=248}} but almost all had waned by the 1940s.{{sfn|Marano|2010|p=253}}

{{Bosniaks}}

'''[[Bosniaks]]''' are the second{{dubious|date=December 2017}} largest [[ethnic minority]] group in [[Kosovo]], numbering 27,553 (2011 census).

==Demographics==
The 2011 census states the number of Bosniaks in Kosovo are 27,553, with around 21,000 of them living in the municipalities of [[Prizren]] and [[Dragaš]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://birn.eu.com/en/100/10/3895/ |title=BIRN |publisher=Birn.eu.com |date=2007-08-22 |accessdate=2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bosniaks]] make up 1.6% of the whole population.

==Bosniaks in Prizren==
From Tuzla they arrived first in 1935, continued until 1945. The reason of their arrival was to able to immigrate to Turkey under the Yugoslavian-Turkish migration law, samely tried some other Bosniaks in Socialist Republic of Macedonia. Today they are present in 18 villages: Nebregošte, Manastirica, Ljubinje Gornjo, Ljubinje Donjo, Rečane, Lokvica, Sredska, Bogošovce, Mušnikovo, Plavanje, Grnje Selo, Rlačiki, Pejciki, Drlajčiči, Milačiki, Zivinjanje.

==Politics==
There is a several Bosniak political parties in Kosovo and the oldest one is [[Bosniak Party of Democratic Action of Kosovo]] (''Bošnjačka stranka demokratske akcije Kosova'').

[[Bosniaks]] feel generally safe in [[Republic of Kosovo|Kosovo]], but there are few that experience violence targeted towards them. There have been no Bosniak returns to [[Republic of Kosovo|Kosovo]]. Instead, more [[Bosniaks]] are selling their homes to leave for [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;UNHCR.[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/41249bdd4.pdf Update on the Kosovo Roma, Ashkaelia, Egyptian, Serb, Bosniak, Gorani and Albanian communities in a minority situation] Retrieved 2012-09-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect '''presidential elections''' were held in [[Burundi]] on 19 August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/burundi-2005-presidential-election-results Burundi: 2005 Presidential election results] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109153218/http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/burundi-2005-presidential-election-results |date=January 9, 2015 }} EISA&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[National Assembly (Burundi)|National Assembly]] and [[Senate (Burundi)|Senate]] chose the new president of the republic for a five-year term. The sole candidate, [[Pierre Nkurunziza]] of the [[National Council for the Defense of Democracy – Forces for the Defense of Democracy|CNDD–FDD]], was elected by a vote of 151–9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionguide.org/digest/post/12019/ Burundi Announces Presidential Election Results] IFES&lt;/ref&gt; Nkurunziza was sworn in on 26 August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uca.edu/politicalscience/dadm-project/sub-saharan-africa-region/burundi-1962-present/ 43.

==History==
The PRD was established in 2000 by Jacinto Santos, a former member of the [[Movement for Democracy (Cape Verde)|Movement for Democracy]], who had served as mayor of [[Praia]].&lt;ref name=HDCV&gt;Richard A Lobban Jr &amp; Paul Khalil Saucier (2007) ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cape Verde'', Scarecrow Press, p181&lt;/ref&gt; The party received 3.4% of the vote in the [[Cape Verdean parliamentary election, 2001|2001 elections]], but failed to win a seat in the [[National Assembly (Cape Verde)|National Assembly]].

'''[[List of Provincial Governors of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Gubernatorial]] elections''' were held in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in March 2014.

The elections were initially scheduled for 2012, but were delayed until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Genser|first1=Jared|title=The United Nations Security Council in the Age of Human Rights|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-107-04007-6|page=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elections were held for nineteen provincial governors.  Fourteen of the elections were won by allies of [[President of the Democratic Republic of Congo|President]] [[Joseph Kabila]], and were considered to have shored up Kabila's position, particularly in terms of control over local defence forces.&lt;ref name="fortune"&gt;{{cite news|title=Congo's Kabila Consolidates Local Control in Governors' Elections|url=http://fortune.com/2016/03/26/congo-kabila-governor-election/|accessdate=3 September 2016|work=Fortune|agency=Reuters|date=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some leaders of the opposition claimed that the elections had been rigged.&lt;ref name="fortune" /&gt;

'''Elk's Head of Huittinen''' ({{lang-fi|Huittisten hirvenpää}}, also known as '''Moose's Head''') is a [[Mesolithic]] [[moose]] head [[figurine]] of [[soapstone]] found in 1903 from [[Huittinen]] in the province of [[Satakunta]], [[Finland]]. The sculpture is dated to between 8,000 and 9,000 years ago. It is placed in the permanent exhibition of [[National Museum of Finland]] in [[Helsinki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.fi/en/nationalmuseum/exhibitions/permanent National Museum Permanent Exhibition] Finnish National Board of Antiquities. Retrieved 30 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Replicas are displayed in the [[Museum of Huittinen]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huittinen.fi/palvelut/kulttuuri_ja_vapaa-aika/huittisten_museo/perusnayttely Museum of Huittinen] (in Finnish). Retrieved 30 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the sculpture collection of [[University of Helsinki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/taidehistoria/tietoa/kokoelmat/Kipsit/Veistokuva/VeistoEn.htm Sculpture Collection of the Department of Art History] University of Helsinki. Retrieved 30 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Elk's Head is most likely the best-known archaeological artifact in Finland.

== Discovery ==
The Elk's Head is the oldest stone sculpture found in Finland. It was discovered in 1903 by a farm worker in a potato field in the village of Palojoki near Huittinen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huittinen.fi/en/information/history_and_influential_people History and Influential People] Municipality of Huittinen. Retrieved 30 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later the figurine was sold on a market in [[Turku]]. It was placed in the collection of a local historical museum and eventually came into the possession of the Finnish National Museum. 

== Description ==
The ca. 10 [[centimeter]] long figurine is made of soapstone which is not found in [[Western Finland]]. The sculpture or at least its material is probably imported from the eastern parts of the country. Elk's Head has a hole for mounting a rod so it was most likely used as a [[sceptre]] in a ritual context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://donsmaps.com/norge.html Norwegian Rock Art - Alta Fjord] Don's Maps.

Founded in October 2005 from [[trade union|unions]] that had begun organizing after the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion]], the '''Federation of Oil Unions of Iraq''' is the largest independent union consortium in [[Iraq]], with tens of thousands of members. It fully opposes the [[Military occupation|occupation]].

First organized in the Southern Oil Company Union in May 2003, Iraq's [[oil]] workers began organizing what became the [[General Union of Oil Employees]] (GUOE). They have pushed to keep Iraq's resources in the hands of Iraqis, while the union remained independent of any [[political parties]] and influences from the foreign occupation.  It has not affiliated to either of the two major union federations of Iraq: the [[Iraqi Communist Party]]-connected [[Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions]] or the [[Worker-Communist Party of Iraq]]-influenced [[Federation of Workers Councils and Unions in Iraq]], but it has worked with both groupings.

As SOCU, the oil workers engaged in [[direct action]] to expel [[Baathist]] managers from oil facilities, occupation forces began moving in to attempt to take over administration of the industry. Kellogg Brown and Root (KBR) led this, and was also militantly removed by the SOCU workers, along with subcontracted laborers. With threats to [[Strike action|strike]], the union was able to gain wage increases over what the United States-led occupation was willing to pay. KBR eventually took over much of the administration of the oil industry, although resistance in the form of strikes in June and August of that year, and blockades, continued. In cases where occupation forces threatened force, the SOCU workers warned that they would be met with armed resistance.

In June 2004, the GUOE was formed from the workers of the major oil companies: Southern Oil Company, Southern Gas Company, Southern Refinery Company, Iraqi Drilling Company, the Oil Carrier Company, the Gas Packing Company, the Oil Production Company, the Oil Projects Company, and the Oil Pipe Lines Company. In May 2005, the GUOE organized a large conference against [[privatization]] with hundreds of unionists and representatives of other international groups. More strikes came in July and August, usually with outcomes favorable to the workers. In October, union president [[Hassan Jumaa Awad]] led the group to change its name to the Federation of Oil Unions of Iraq.

The '''flag of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic''' was the red Soviet flag with white and green stripes below the gold [[hammer and sickle]], with the measures: 1/2 red, 1/5 white, 1/10 green, 1/5 red. The flag sported the [[Pan-Iranian colors]] of red, white and green, as a nod to the republic's Persian culture{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}. The flag was adopted on March 20, 1953 by decree of the Supreme Soviet of the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic|Tajik SSR]]: 

{{quote|''The national flag of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic is a panel consisting of four horizontal colored stripes: the upper band of red which is half the width of the flag; white stripe, making one fifth of the width of the flag; green stripes, is one-tenth the width of the flag, and the lower band of red color, is one-fifth the width of the flag. On top of the red band at the flagpole located gold [[hammer and sickle]] and above them is an five-pointed [[red star]] framed by a gold border. The ratio of the flag's width to its length is 1: 2.''

''The fitting of the hammer and sickle into a square whose side wound 1/4 width of the flag. The sharp end of the sickle falls in the middle of the upper side of the square, handles the sickle and hammer rest on the bottom corners of the square. hammer with a handle length is 3/4 of the diagonal of a square. The five-pointed star in a circle fits 1/8 width of the flag relating to the upper side of the square. Distance vertical axis of the star, the hammer and sickle from the grapnel is equal to 1/4 of the flag's width. The distance from the top edge of the flag of the flag to the center of the star - 1/10 of the flag's width.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vexillographia.ru/tadjik/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The red represents the unity of the republic and the aspect of workers' revolution, white symbolized cotton production, the basis of Tajik agriculture, and the green was for other agricultural produce.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/su-tj.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|History of Tajikistan| Flags of the Soviet Union}}
The first specifically Tajik flag was introduced in 1929. Before that, Tajikistan had been part of the [[Bukharan SSR]] (partly [[National delimitation in the Soviet Union#National delimitation in Central Asia|transferred]] to the [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkestan SSR]] in 1924); before the Russian revolution it had been part of the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] (since 1873 a protectorate of the [[Russian Empire]]).

Following independence on September 9, 1991, the Tajik SSR flag remained in use until the [[Flag of Tajikistan|new Tajik flag]] was adopted in November 1992, becoming the last post-Soviet country to receive a new flag.

The '''Gáva-Holigrady culture''' was a late [[bronze age]] culture of Eastern [[Slovakia]], Western Ukraine ([[Zakarpats'ka Oblast]] and [[Dnister]] river basin), Northwestern  Romania and Northeastern Hungary.

It is considered a subtype of the [[Urnfield culture]]. 

Gava-Holigrady culture is named after an archaeological settlement Gava in Northeastern Hungary and an archaeological site Holigrady (Голігради) in Ukrainian [[Ternopil Oblast]].

In Slovakia, the culture has originated in the early twentieth century BC. 

Gáva people lived in settlements and castles that they built in the Slovakian and [[Transylvania|Transylvanian]] uplands.

Gava-Holigrad people considered to be of Thracian ethnicity.

The '''H. C. Ørsted Medal''' is a medal for scientific achievement awarded by the Danish ''Selskabet for naturlærens udbredelse'' (The Society for the Dissemination of Natural Science). Named for the society's founder [[Hans Christian Ørsted]], it is awarded chiefly to Danes. The medal is awarded in three versions: gold is for outstanding original scientific work in physics or chemistry published during the previous year; silver is for outstanding writing of science for a popular audience over several years; and bronze is for outstanding popularization of science through non-written methods, such as in museums or through business.

Docherty and Sjaak van der Velden, ''Historical Dictionary of Organized Labor'', pp.140-141&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, the small [[Universal Alliance of Diamond Workers]] merged into the federation.&lt;ref name="merger"&gt;{{cite web|title=Diamond And Allied Workers Join ICEM|url=http://www.industriall-union.org/archive/icem/diamond-and-allied-workers-join-icem|website=IndustriALL|publisher=ICEM|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012 affiliates of ICEM joined the new global federation [[IndustriALL Global Union]].

The organization represented workers employed in a wide range of industries, including [[Energy development|energy]], [[mining]], [[chemical industry|chemicals]] and [[bioscience]], [[Pulp and paper industry|pulp and paper]], [[rubber]], [[Gemstone|gems]] and [[jewellery]], [[glass]], [[ceramic]]s, [[cement]], [[environmental services]] and others.

== Organization and activities ==
The international headquarters of ICEM was based in [[Brussels|Brussels, Belgium]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is where the meetings were held of the Presidium and the Executive Committee of ICEM. These governing bodies organized activities on a higher level while the regional offices organized regional conferences, workshops and solidarity actions. The Presidium oversaw the grand line of ICEM whilst the Executive Committee was more involved in the day-to-day routine of the organization. Every four years, starting in 1995, a worldwide congress was organized in which new committee members were elected and policies were changed. The congresses were held in the following order: 

* Washington DC, 1995. 
* Durban, South Africa, in November 1999. 
* Stavanger, Norway, in August 2003. 
* Bangkok, Thailand, in November 2007. 

The regional offices dealt with specific geographical areas such as Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean and North America. The regional office of the Asia Pacific area was housed in Seoul, South Korea. This regional office was one of the most active offices of ICEM.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

ICEM supported many strikes in various regions including the strike of 7 October 1998 in Russia by communists and the [[Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia]] during the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|1998 Russian Financial Crisis]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10622/ARCH02742|title=International Federation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General Workers' Unions (ICEM) Archives|last=|first=|date=27 July 2018|website=International Institute of Social History|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affiliates of ICEM have also organized protests in South Africa. ICEM worked together with human rights and environmental activists who were in conflict with multinationals such as [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] by raising awareness and funding research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

ICEM published two quarterly bulletins called 'ICEM Info' and 'ICEM Global' which merged in 2002 to become 'ICEM Global Info'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10622/A39AFB8C-A705-441A-99F4-01DBA147C0BC|title=ICEM info|last=|first=|date=27 July 2018|website=International Institute of Social History|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Research ==
Richard Croucher and Elizabeth Cotton's book ''Global Unions, Global Business'' contains a case study of the ICEM's dealings with the Anglo-American mining company. This is in Chapter Eight. The book is published by Middlesex University Press (2009). {{ISBN|978-1-904750-62-8}}.

The archive of ICEM is housed in the [[International Institute of Social History]] in Amsterdam and is open to the public.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Modern Finnish joulupöytä.jpg|thumb|right|A modern Finnish ''joulupöytä''.]]
'''''Joulupöytä''''' (translated "[[Yule]] table") is the traditional assortment of foods served at [[Christmas]] in [[Finland]], similar to the Swedish [[Smörgåsbord#Julbord|julbord]]. It contains many different dishes, most of them typical for the season. The main dish is usually a large Christmas [[ham (meat)|ham]], which is eaten with [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]] or bread along with the other dishes. Fish is also served (often [[lutefisk]] and [[gravlax]]), and the ham is served with ''laatikko''s, casseroles made with swede, potato and carrot, occasionally liver. The traditional Christmas beverage is either alcoholic or non-alcoholic [[mulled wine]] (''glögi'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]).

==Dishes==
The traditional dishes of ''joulupöytä'' include:

*[[Christmas ham]] with [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]]
*[[Karjalanpaisti|Karelian stew]] (not served everywhere in Finland)
*[[Lipeäkala]] with melted butter and [[white sauce]]
*[[Gravlax]] and [[lavaret]], often served with chopped [[red onion]] and [[sour cream]]
*[[Pickled herring]] in various forms (tomato, mustard, ''matjes'' or onion sauces)
*Potato [[casserole]] ([[Sweetened potato casserole|sweetened]] or not, depending on the region and preference)
*Carrot [[casserole]]
*[[Liver casserole]]
*Rutabaga [[casserole]]
*Boiled [[potato]]es
*''Rosolli'' (salad from boiled beetroots, carrots, potatoes, apples and pickled cucumber. It's sometimes served with herring.)
*Mushroom salad
*[[Mustard (condiment)|Mustard]]
*Various [[sauce]]s

==Beverages==
Beverages most often served are:

*[[Schnapps]] such as ''[[Koskenkorva Viina]]'' as an appetizer
*[[Beer]], often special Christmas varieties. Most Finnish breweries have [[seasonal beer]]s for Christmas. Homemade beer is also common.
*[[Milk]]
*[[Wine]] is nontraditional, but has grown in popularity
*[[Mulled wine]] (glögi) either alcoholic or non-alcoholic

==Desserts==
The usual desserts are:

*Prune jam pastries also known as ''[[joulutorttu]]'' - Christmas tarts which are also called joulutahti - which means Christmas stars as they are made in a star shape.
*[[Gingerbread]] called piparkakku - commonly as round shapes, and sometimes as houses, usually the biscuits are not decorated, but the houses may be iced.
*Mixed fruit soup 
*[[Kissel|Kiisseli]] which is a plum runny desert commonly served with whipped cream.
*[[Rice pudding]] or rice porridge with cinnamon, sugar and cold milk or with raisin or mixed fruit soup called riisipuoro - rice porridge 
*[[Ice cream]] with jam
*[[Confectionery|Confectioneries]] and other [[sweets]], especially [[chocolate]]s 
*Coffee, the Finns prefer a mild roast and serve this as pannukahvi - made a special way. Tea, is less common and fruit teas become more common rather than just black tea. [[Glögi]], glögi is usually served with almonds and raisins in it and is non-alcoholic. It is found in many public settings and while alcohol could be added it would be uncommon to typically offer it this way in contrast with other cultures that offer mulled wine, which is alcoholic. 

Usually the rice porridge is served from a large, common kettle and an [[almond]] has been hidden in it. The one who gets the almond gets his or her Christmas presents first or [[Mandelgave|gets a wish]]. Sometimes rice porridge is served as breakfast.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3366">'''Kaliprasanna Vidyaratna''' (1255 — 1330 [[Bengali calendars|Bangabdo]]; 1849-1924 AD) was an Indian scholar of [[Sanskrit]], academician and author. He was the principal of the [[Sanskrit College]] between 1908 and 1910. Vidyarayna played an important role in the revival of Sanskrit language.

==Early life==
Vidyaratna was born in a Bhattacharya [[Brahmin]] family of Ujirpur village, [[Barisal Division|Barishal]] in [[British India]]. His father was Biswambhar Bhattacharya. Vidyaratna learned Sanskrit in a ''Chatuspathi'' at Dhanuka village of [[Faridpur district]]. He passed the entrance exam from Barishal and entered the [[Scottish Church College]], [[Kolkata]]. After completion of B.A. and M.A. he was appointed as a teacher at the [[Dhaka]] [[Jagannath College]] in 1881. He worked in [[Presidency College Calcutta|Presidency College]] since 1901, thereafter becoming principal of Sanskrit College.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sansad Bangali Charitavidhan (Bengali)|url=https://books.google.co.in/books/about/সংসদ_বাঙালি_চর.html?id=TwwHBke-2HQC|last=Vol I|first=Subodhchandra Sengupta &amp; Anjali Basu|publisher=Sahitya Sansad|year=2002|isbn=81-85626-65-0|location=Kolkata|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bakota''' (or Kota) are a [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] [[ethnic group]] from the northeastern region of [[Gabon]].  The language they speak is called [[iKota]], but is sometimes referred to as Bakota, ikuta, Kota, and  among the [[Beti-Pahuin#Fang|Fang]], they are known as Mekora. The language has several dialects, which include: Ndambomo, Mahongwe, Ikota-la-hua, Sake, Menzambi, Bougom. Some of these dialects themselves include regional variations of some kind. 

The Kota are traditionally a [[patriarchal]] society, however some of the sub-groups such as the Mahongwe have over time adopted a [[matrilineal]] system of [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] (Mahongwe means, "from your father").

The true meaning of Bakota is unclear, however it may be derived from the word kota, which means to bind/to attach/to link, hereby suggesting they view themselves as a united people bound by a common fate.

Estimates indicate that there are at least 43,500 Kota speakers in the world, of whom 34,442 people (79%) live in the [[Ogouee-Ivindo]] province of northeastern Gabon, and 9055 people (21%) in neighboring [[Congo-Brazzaville]].

They are noted for their [[copper]] and [[brass]] [[reliquary]] guardian figures, which are part of a powerful religious and mystical order known as '''Bwete'''. Another key feature of the Kota people is the originality of its circumcision and widow-purification rituals, which are generally kept secret.

Politically, the Kota have been classified under the disputed "stateless societies" category. They have a strong egalitarian background, which in some instances cuts across age and gender lines. Kota children are taught to value tradition, respect for the elderly, and the concept of "Ewele" (loosely translated as 'pride').

The Kota are not considered big players in Gabonese politics, however some Kota have been appointed to key positions in the Government. [[Alexandre Sambat]], a long-time ambassador to the [[United States]] who later ran for president in 1993, was of Kota origin. Pascal Desire Misongo, another Kota, has served as minister of Justice in Gabon.

The {{nihongo|'''Mushroom Kingdom'''|キノコ王国|Kinoko Ōkoku}} is a fictional setting in [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario series]]'', where most of the games take place.

==Overview==
The Mushroom Kingdom is typically presented as a medieval [[monarchy]], with the character [[Princess Peach]] being either its ruler or heir. ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'' and the ''[[Paper Mario]]'' series suggests that the [[chancellor]] of the kingdom is its [[head of government]]. Though Princess Peach and the [[Mario Brothers]] are [[human]], the citizens of the kingdom are the [[mushroom]]-like [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toads]] (called "Kinopios" in Japan).&lt;ref name=Top7 /&gt; The Mushroom Kingdom also features other species, such as the dinosaur-like [[Yoshi]], the turtle-like [[Koopa]], and the typically antagonistic mushroom-like creatures called [[Goomba]]. The Mushroom Kingdom is often tormented by [[King Bowser|Bowser]], the Koopa King, who kidnaps [[Princess Peach]] in nearly all main-series ''Mario'' games. Initially, this was because she had the power to undo Bowser's handiwork, but in recent games, Bowser has developed romantic feelings for the princess. Games in the ''Mario'' series often suggest that the Mushroom Kingdom is a rival of Bowser's domain, the Koopa Kingdom. It is unknown if the Koopa Kingdom is a completely separate area or merely a captured portion of the Mushroom Kingdom.

The Mushroom Kingdom is the setting of most main-series ''Mario'' games but is presented very inconsistently throughout the series. It is uncertain if many areas in the ''Mario'' franchise are part of the Mushroom Kingdom or the larger ''Mario'' universe. There is no established canon regarding the topography of the ''Mario'' world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.giantbomb.com/the-mushroom-kingdom/3035-14/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recurring locations==
The Mushroom Kingdom features several locations that have appeared in a large number of ''Mario'' games. These include:

'''Princess Peach's Castle''', a large Central European-style red-and-white [[castle]] inhabited by the Princess and her [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]] [[Retainer (medieval)|retainers]]. Peach's castle first appeared in ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'' (1996) and served as the central hub in ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. The design of the castle has remained relatively consistent since and it has appeared in games such as ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'', ''[[Paper Mario]]'', ''[[Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time]]'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' (where it is the Mushroom Kingdom's [[capital city]]).

'''Bowser's Castle''' is the abode of [[Bowser (Nintendo)|Bowser]], arch-villain of the ''[[Super Mario]]'' video games. The castle has often been destroyed and rebuilt and appears different in each game that it appears in. It is usually filled with [[lava]] pits, [[booby trap]]s, and Bowser's minions. Variations on Bowser's Castle appear in nearly every ''Mario'' game, and every ''[[Mario Kart]]'' game features at least one track titled "Bowser's Castle".

'''Toad Town''' is the capital of the Mushroom Kingdom as seen in the ''[[Paper Mario]]'' and ''[[Mario &amp; Luigi]]'' series. It is populated by anthropomorphic [[mushroom]]s called the [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toads]]. Other species inhabiting Toad Town vary by game but may include Shaman, Koopa Paratroopas, and Doogans.

==Landscape==
[[File:Novosel mushroom.svg|thumb|160px|right|A mushroom icon modeled on the Mario power-up.]]
The Mushroom Kingdom has been revamped several times over the course of the ''Mario'' games, similar to the kingdom of [[Hyrule]] in [[The Legend of Zelda (series)|''The Legend of Zelda'' series]]. In ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', for example, the Mushroom Kingdom encompasses 32 different [[level (video games)|levels]] of varying terrain. ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' expanded on this concept by adding [[topography]] to the kingdom through means of a map screen.

The games do not follow these landscape variants exactly, but still are recurring themes in the Mario series. For example, even though ''[[Super Mario World]]'' was set in Dinosaur Land, its geography was very similar to the Mushroom Kingdom. The paintings that led to the different levels in ''Super Mario 64'' followed this idea as well.

Blogger Natalie Grigson noted that the grassy fields, mountains, waterfalls, and red-and-white mushrooms seen in the area around Princess Peach's Castle best compares to [[Oslo, Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/07/03/princess-peachs-castle-is-worth-nearly-1-billion-if-it-were-real/|work=[[VentureBeat]]|title=Princess Peach’s castle is worth nearly $1 billion (if it were real)|last=Grubb|first=Jeff|date=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation and objects==
{{See also|Super Mario#Common elements}}
The main mode of [[transportation]] in the Mushroom Kingdom has been said to be through [[warp zone|warp pipes]]. The range of these warp pipes vary in length: some pipes merely travel a short distance (such as over and underground), while some pipes are linked to entirely different worlds. New warp tools and areas have been introduced in games since including the secret "warp whistle" in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and [[cannons]] in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]''. The Mushroom Kingdom consistently features various objects. Dispersed across the land are brown brick blocks and golden "question-mark blocks", which may contain [[Super Mario#Coins|coins]] or [[power-up]]s. The [[video game manual|instruction manual]] of ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' states that Bowser transformed many of the Toads that inhabited the Kingdom into bricks and [[Equisetum|horsetail plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/5710212/nintendos-revised-history-of-super-mario-bros|work=[[Kotaku]]|title=Nintendo's Revised History Of Super Mario Bros.|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|date=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances in other games==
The [[Super Smash Bros. (series)|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]] has thus far included three different [[level (gaming)|levels]] based on the Mushroom Kingdom. The [[Super Smash Bros.|original game]] included the unlockable stage "Mushroom Kingdom" which was graphically based on the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''. ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' included a re-vamped "Mushroom Kingdom" which omitted [[List of Mario series enemies#Piranha Plant|piranha plants]] and warp pipes from the original stage. A stage titled "Mushroom Kingdom II", based on the setting of ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' (Subcon), was also featured in this game.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' includes a level titled "Mushroomy Kingdom", which primarily appears as a dirty, crumbled version of "[[World 1-1]]" of ''Super Mario Bros.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/stages/stage23.html|title=Official Site - Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U|website=Smashbros.com|accessdate=12 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302094513/http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/stages/stage23.html|archivedate=2 March 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parodies==
[[GamesRadar]] wrote a humorous article listing the "Top 7 most disturbing things about the Mushroom Kingdom", listing facts such as "the kingdom's greatest hero is a dumpy plumber", "the political system is a complete mess", and "everything is alive" as examples.&lt;ref name=Top7&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/top-7-most-disturbing-things-about-mushroom-kingdom/ |title=The Top 7...

Now that’s the sort of down-to-earth question a real plumber would ask when confronted with a magical mushroom kingdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/a-real-plumber-wouldnt-last-long-in-the-mushroom-kingdo-1703328483 |title=A Real Plumber Wouldn't Last Long In The Mushroom Kingdom |publisher=Kotaku |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' lauded the fact that ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'' allowed players to "build the Mushroom Kingdom of [their] dreams", writing "since Mario first won the hearts of gamers across the world in the early ‘80s, fans have been sketching up their own ideas for Mario levels on paper and imagining what sort of worlds they could create for the iconic plumber to explore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/super_mario_maker/b/wii_u/archive/2015/09/11/game-informer-super-mario-maker-review.aspx |title=Super Mario Maker |publisher=Game Informer |accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Carnegie Mellon University]] student created a humorous fanbook that explored the species of flora in the Mushroom Kingdom; this was later recommended to readers by ''Kotaku''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5239908/the-science-of-the-mushroom-kingdom-explores-super-flora |title='The Science of the Mushroom Kingdom' Explores Super Flora |publisher=Kotaku |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fan-created mod of ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' titled ''Super Skyrim Bros'' turns the game environment into the Mushroom Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2012/10/5/3460292/super-skyrim-bros-mod-gives-skyrim-a-mushroom-kingdom-twist |title=Super Skyrim Bros mod gives Skyrim a Mushroom Kingdom twist |publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PTR Chart 2018.png|thumb|400px|Chart of area of land declared as Private Timber Reserves in Tasmania - 2018]]

A '''private timber reserve''' is an area of privately owned land, used or intended to be used, for growing timber within the Australian state of [[Tasmania]].

Landowners can have their land declared as a Private Timber Reserve and protect their right to use private land to grow timber. Private land or freehold land refers to land registered under [[Torrens title]].  A landowner is the person(s) and/or legal entity registered on the Torrens Title.

Private Timber Reserves are unique, with no other State in Australia, or internationally, providing the land owner with protection of their rights to use their planted land, land they intend to plant or [[Forests of Australia|native]] forests areas, to grow timber.

Growing timber is long term investment with trees often taking decades to grow to maturity.  Forest and tree owners need certainty that they will be able to harvest in the future.  Securing the right to use land to grow timber provides some certainty that the owner will be able to harvest in the future.

In the Australian State of [[New South Wales]], landowners can apply to have timber plantations authorised as 'complying plantations' and have a guaranteed right to harvest...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plantations and Reafforestation Act 1999 No 97|url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1999/97/part2/sec8|website=NSW Legislation|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This guarantee is only extended to plantation, not native forests or land intended to be planted.

== Legal definition ==

Private Timber Reserve is land that has been declared as a Private Timber Reserve under Section 11 of the ''Forests Practices Act 1985''.&lt;ref name="FPA1985"&gt;{{cite web|title=Forests Practices Act 1985|url=http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;cond=ALL;doc_id=48%2B%2B1985%2BAT%40EN%2B20151015090000;histon=;prompt=;rec=;term=Forest|website=TheLaw|publisher=Tasmanian Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was passed by both Houses of the Tasmanian Government in 1985, and received Royal Assent 25 May 1985, with a commencement date of 2 November 1987 for Part II – Private Timber Reserves.

Land declared as a Private Timber Reserve is ''"used only for establishing forests, or growing or harvesting timber in accordance with the Forest Practices Code and such other activities which the Authority considers to be compatible with establishing forests, or growing or harvesting timber"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forests Practices Act Section 12 1985|url=http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;cond=ALL;doc_id=48%2B%2B1985%2BAT%40EN%2B20151015090000;histon=;prompt=;rec=;term=Forest|website=TheLaw|publisher=State of Tasmania|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activities considered to be compatible are; apiary sites, education and scientific purposes, grazing under well established trees, hunting, nature based recreation.&lt;ref name = PTR_Info_sheet&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Sheet  – Private Timber Reserves|url=http://www.pft.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/131750/PTR_Information_Sheet.pdf|website=Private Forests Tasmania|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration of the Private Timber Reserve is registered on the [[Torrens title|land title]] as per Section 15 of the ''Forests Practices Act 1985''.&lt;ref name="FPA1985" /&gt; The declaration of the Private Timber Reserve remains with the title(s), despite changes in ownership, or until an application to revoke is submitted by the landowner and approved. A landowner can make an application to revoke all or part of the area declared as a Private Timber Reserve, at any time.

A Private Timber Reserve is an area of land, used or intended to be used, for growing timber.  It could be an area of native forest, plantation (exotic and native species) or land intended to be used to grow timber. The land has to be capable of growing timber. The minimum area that can be declared a Private Timber Reserve is five hectares.

Timber means trunks and branches of trees, whether standing or not, and all wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forests Practices Act 1985 – Section 3|url=http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;cond=;doc_id=48%2B%2B1985%2BAT%40EN%2B20151015090000;histon=;prompt=;rec=;term=|website=TheLaw|publisher=State of Tasmania|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition includes the full range of wood products; all categories of saw logs, veneer logs, [[pulpwood]] and [[firewood]].

=== Applications === 
The process to declare an area a Private Timber Reserve is set out in the Part II of the ''Forest Practices Act 1985''.&lt;ref name="FPA1985" /&gt;

The landowner completes an application form, and informs anyone who has an interest in the land or the trees as per Section 5&lt;ref name = FPA1985 /&gt; of the application. Landowners can declare any part or all their land a Private Timber Reserves.

The application is in two parts, Part A to be completed by the Applicant (landowner) and Part B, completed by a person authorised by the Forests Practices Authority Board.  Part B of the Application&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Application to declare land as a private timber reserve Part B|url=http://www.pft.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/131756/PTR_1B_03_07_Application_to_Declare_Part_B.pdf|website=Private Forests Tasmania|publisher=Private Forests Tasmania|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires details on vegetation cover, and on any natural or cultural values on the area.  A Private Timber Reserve can only be declared over an area where forestry activity can be undertaken in accordance with the Forest Practices Code.   
  
[[Private Forests Tasmania]] assesses the application and makes a recommendation to the Board of the Forest Practices Authority that the Private Timber Reserve be granted, or not.  Private Forest Tasmania has a delegation under the ''Forest Practices Act 1985''&lt;ref name = FPA1985 /&gt; – Part II PRIVATE TIMBER RESERVES, from the Board of the Forest Practices Authority to accept, assess and make recommendations on applications to declare and revoke land as private timber reserve

The declaration of the land as a Private Timber Reserve is registered on the land title, and can be declared over a whole title or over part of a title.&lt;ref name = FPA1985 /&gt;

Application fees apply. Section 5 (2)(d) ''Forests Practices Act 1985''&lt;ref name = FPA1985 /&gt; requires that, "an application to declare land as a private timber reserve must be accompanied by a fee". Originally the cost per application was AUD$100 (prior to 1999) with a fee of AUD$350 introduced in 1999–2000. The fee increase followed an instruction from the Government that the fee should cover the costs of processing the application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Private Forests Tasmania – Annual Report 1999-2000|url=http://www.pft.tas.gov.au/images/pdfs/Annual_Report_1999-00.pdf|website=Private Forests Tasmania|publisher=Private Forests Tasmania|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application fee is subject to annual increase under the ''Fee Units Act 1997''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fee Units Act 1997|url=http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;cond=;doc_id=47%2B%2B1997%2BAT%40EN%2B20151015000000;histon=;prompt=;rec=;term=|website=TheLaw|publisher=State of Tasmania|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An application to declare land as a Private Timber Reserve attracts 350 fee units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Practices Regulations 2007 (S.R. 2007, No. 18) Schedule 1 – fees|url=http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;cond=ALL;doc_id=%2B18%2B2007%2BAT%40EN%2B20151015170000;histon=;prompt=;rec=;term=Fee%20Unit|website=TheLaw|publisher=State of Tasmania|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018–19, a fee unit value was set at AUD$1.58 per fee unit &lt;ref name="Fee Units"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.treasury.tas.gov.au/economy/economic-policy-and-reform/fee-units |title=Fee Units |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Currently the fee is AUD$553 (July 2018)&lt;ref name="Explanation for fee increase 2018-2019"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pft.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/131752/Explanation_for_fee_increase_2018-2019.pdf| title=Explanation for fee increase 2018-2019 |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus the cost of registering the declaration on the land title.

The Crown Solicitor charges a fee to register the Private Timber Reserve on the land title, AUD$104.50 (including [[Goods and services tax (Australia)|GST]]) if a Private Timber Reserve covers only full titles, and an additional AUD$104.50 (including GST) if a Private Timber Reserve covers part of the land title listed in the application as well.

=== Forest practices plans ===
Section 18(2)b of the ''Forest Practices Act 1985''&lt;ref name = FPA1985 /&gt; states that a forests practices plan is to  ''" contain, in the case of a private timber reserve, or where the owner of the land referred to in the plan wishes to restock the land with trees, specifications in connection with the restocking of the land with tree"''.

A forest practices plan can not be certified for an area declared as a Private Timber Reserve, unless the reforestation section of the plan contains restocking requirements.&lt;ref name = PTR_Info_sheet /&gt;

=== Land tax ===
Under the ''Land Tax Act 2000''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Land Tax Act 2000|url=http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;cond=ALL;doc_id=74%2B%2B2000%2BAT%40EN%2B20160912160000;histon=;pdfauthverid=;prompt=;rec=;rtfauthverid=;term=Land%20Tax%20Act;webauthverid=|website=TheLaw|publisher=State of Tasmania|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; landowners in [[Tasmania]] are subject to annual land tax, based on land value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Land Tax Calculator|url=http://www.sro.tas.gov.au/landtax/calculator|publisher=Department of Treasury and Finance|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the land meets the definition of Primary Production Land or PPL classification applies to land as at 1 July in any year, then the owner of that land is not required to pay land tax for that land in that financial year.  Land declared as a Private Timber Reserve under section 11 of the ''Forest Practices Act 1985''&lt;ref name = FPA1985 /&gt; and advertised in the Tasmanian Government Gazette is eligible for PPL classification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guideline – Primary Production Land|url=http://www.sro.tas.gov.au/domino%5Cdtf%5CSROWebsite.nsf/v-all/E190FB4C87D4BD8FCA25760200178394/$file/LTX_096.pdf|publisher=State Revenue Office, Department of Treasury and Finance|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and no land tax is payable.

== Rationale ==
The 'Report of the Board of Inquiry into Private Forestry Development in Tasmania 1977'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Everett|first1=M.G.|last2=Gentle|first2=S.W|title=Report of the Board of Inquiry into Private Forestry Development in Tasmania|date=July 1997|location=Hobart|isbn=0724603379}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommended that;
''"That statutory provisions be made for a 'dedication' scheme in relation to private land based broadly on the British scheme which has operated since 1947 and that direct financial assistance be provided by the Government within the framework of the scheme.''"

The Report authors recognised the need, and potential return to the industry and State, if assistance was provided to private forest owners. Such assistance was proposed to be provided to owner who had dedicated their land for forestry. Like the British scheme the aim was to encourage the proper management of native forests.

The Board also discussed the illogical distinctions drawn by finance companies between moneys available for clearing of forests and agriculture and for forestry.  Investment funds for forestry were difficult to obtain.  In summary, the need to secure investment in private forestry was recognised and the dedication of a private timber reserve was a key element to securing that investment, either from the government or the private sector.

=== Forest Practices Act (1985) ===

When the Bill for the ''Forest Practices Act'' was introduced into the Tasmanian Parliament in April 1985, the Minister for Forests, [[Robin Gray (Australian politician)|Robin Gray]], referenced the Private Forestry Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Felton|first1=Ken|title=The Companion to Tasmanian History – Forestry|url=http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/F/Forestry.htm|website=The Companion to Tasmanian History: First Edition.|publisher=Centre for Tasmanian Historical Studies University of Tasmania|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommendation to create the "concept of private timber reserve".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forests Practices Bill 1985 – Second Reading|date=17 April 1985|publisher=Parliament of Tasmania|location=Hobart|pages=1231|url=http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/HansardArchive/isysquery/38dc163c-7a57-4965-a606-cd6094b34e1d/1/doc/H19850417.pdf#xml=http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/HansardArchive/isysquery/38dc163c-7a57-4965-a606-cd6094b34e1d/1/hilite/|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation | Part II provides for a concept of private timber reserves, a unique process to encourage private forestry. It will assist to develop an adequate private forest estate to help ensure that the forest-based industries have the necessary future resource. It provides an opportunity for a landowner to volunteer his forest for registration as a private timber reserve. This has the effect of ensuring that forestry is an approved long term land use in the event that a universal planning scheme covers the area and that he may therefore be assured of the opportunity to harvest his forest having grown it for many years. There is provision for compensation where a landowner is prevented from harvesting his timber when he intended to create a private timber reserve.}}

=== 1962 amendments ===
On the introduction of the ''Forest Practices Act 1985''&lt;ref name = FPA1985 /&gt; amendments were made to sections 756 and 759 of the now repealed.&lt;ref name =LGA1962&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Tas|num_act|lga196267o1962228|Local Government Act 1962}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Local Government Act 1962''&lt;ref name =LGA1962 /&gt; Section 756, provided local government with the power to terminate certain non-conforming uses under a planning scheme.  If a use was terminated a landowner had to seek approval to use their land, even if the use of the land use had not changed. The ''Forest Practices Act 1985''&lt;ref name = FPA1985 /&gt; amendment meant land declared as Private Timber Reserve was one land use where the power to terminate non-conforming uses did not apply. The other uses, where the power to terminate non-conforming uses does not apply, were; the site of a dwelling house or land used for agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, pasture, or similar purpose.

The 1985 amendment of Section 758 of the ''Local Government Act 1962'',&lt;ref name =LGA1962 /&gt; provided for the land declared as Private Timber Reserve to be treated as a lawful use of land. This meant that land used for forestry had same status as land used for agriculture.

These amendments were deemed necessary because the use of the land for forestry purposes is not obvious.  It is relatively simple to recognise land used for housing and agriculture, and hence continuing use, because the land contains buildings or crops or livestock. The use of an area of forest, used for forestry purposes, is infrequent and the period between any activity may span decades.

=== 1993 amendments ===
There was a need to ensure that 'continuing use' be recognised was also addressed in the new planning Act ''Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993''&lt;ref name = LUPAA /&gt; introduced in 1993.

Under the ''Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993''&lt;ref name = LUPAA /&gt; on land: where use has stopped for 2 years or more periods; or which has stopped for 2 or more periods which together total 2 years in any period of 3 years; or in the case of a use which is seasonal in nature, if the use does not take place for 2 years in succession; is subject to the operation of a planning scheme or interim order.

Forestry has a pattern of land use where there is activity when planted or regenerated occurs, and then years later when thinning or harvesting occurs.  It is often not apparent that in the period between planting/regeneration and any harvest, the land is being used to grow timber. The direct reference to Private Timber Reserves was necessary otherwise the pattern of use of land for forestry, could have resulted in the land being subject to planning schemes and interim orders, without the fact the land was being used for forestry, and had been for decades, being recognised.

Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993 &lt;ref name = LUPAA /&gt; requires [[Local government areas of Tasmania|local government authorities]] to create planning schemes and zone land for uses. Areas of land were zoned for forestry use as a permitted use. Other areas of land where forestry occurred, but not zoned with forestry as a permitted used, required a development permit from the local government authority. These development permits do not provide any certainty that the land owner would be able to harvest the wood grown.  Permits are usually issued for native forest harvest and regeneration, or to establish a plantation, but did not explicitly create the right to harvest at a latter date.

In Section 20 (7) of the ''Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993'';&lt;ref name = LUPAA /&gt;

{{quotation | Nothing in any planning scheme or special planning order affects (a) forestry operations conducted on land declared as a private timber reserve under the Forest Practices Act 1985.}}

Section 20(7) also applies to mineral exploration, fishing and marine farming operations.  Forestry, mineral exploration, fishing and marine farming are not subject to the provisions of planning schemes.

It is possible for a landowner to apply for a Private Timber Reserve, where under a local planning scheme forestry is a use permitted or where a permit is required. A Private Timber Reserves cannot be declared over an area where forestry is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Practices Act 1985 Section 8(2)(d)|url=http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;cond=ALL;doc_id=48%2B%2B1985%2BAT%40EN%2B20151015090000;histon=;prompt=;rec=;term=Forest|website=TheLaw|publisher=State of Tasmania|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forest Practices Tribunal ==
Under Section 9 of the ''Forests Practices Act 1985''&lt;ref name = FPA1985 /&gt;
an appeal can be made to the Forest Practices Tribunal against a refusal to grant, or the granting of a Private Timber Reserve.  Twenty eight appeals were lodged with the Tribunal, 7 were upheld and 21 dismissed.

In two Appeals, the Appellant offered no proof to the Tribunal hearing.&lt;ref name="1997 TASFPT 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1997 TASFPT 4"/&gt; In five other appeals,&lt;ref name="1997 TASFPT 6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1997 TASFPT 7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1997 TASFPT 9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1999 TASFPT 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2004 TASFPT 1"/&gt;

The [[Meander Valley Council]] appealed to the Tribunal on nine occasions, and was successful on only one appeal (TASPFT 10 1997).  The nine appeals include two appeals where no proof was provided to the Tribunal.  In these two appeals the Council appealed to the Tribunal but provided no proof or submission to the Tribunal to support their appeal.

An additional three Tribunal hearings were held to consider costs.

=== Justice Crawford decision (1998) ===
An application to declare an area a Private Timber Reserve was received in June 1997, and assessed as per the requirements the Act Section 8 (d) of the ''Forests Practices Act 1985''&lt;ref name = FPA1985 /&gt; which sets the grounds for granting or refusing and application. The local government authority, the [[Meander Valley Council]] lodged an objection to the application as provided in the Section 7 of the Act.&lt;ref name = FPA1985 /&gt; Their ground for the objection was that forestry ''"would not be in the public interest"'' as allowed under Section 8 of the Act.&lt;ref name = FPA1985 /&gt;

The Board of the Forest Practices Authority approved the application and the Meander Valley Council appealed the decision to the Forest Practices Tribunal under Section 9 of the Act.&lt;ref name = FPA1985 /&gt; The Tribunal held a hearing on 13 October 1997, with the decision to dismiss the appeal delivered on 10 November 1997.&lt;ref name="1997 TASFPT 10"/&gt;

On 8 November 1997, the Meander Valley Planning Scheme 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Meander Valley Planning Scheme 1995|publisher=Meander Valley Council|url=http://www.meander.tas.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/Meander_Valley_Planning_Scheme_1995.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; came into effect and forestry become a prohibited activity on the land covered by the application.  This meant on 8 November 1997, forestry was prohibited on the land and the decision of the Tribunal of 10 November was void. Under Section 8 (2) (d) of the Act &lt;ref name = FPA1985 /&gt; refusal of an application is required if...

{{quotation | (d) by virtue of the operation of any Act, the owner of the land is prohibited from establishing forests, or growing or harvesting timber, on the land.}}

The planning scheme declaration on 8 November 1997 meant owner of the land was prohibited from establishing forests, or growing or harvesting timber, on the land.

In early February 1998, the Meander Valley Council registered an appeal against the decision of the Forest Practices Tribunal with the [[Tasmanian Supreme Court]].  The Crown did not contest the appeal as establishing forests, or growing or harvesting timber was prohibited on the land under the local planning scheme at 8 November 1997, two days before the Tribunal decision.

Justice [[Ewan Crawford|Crawford]] on 16 March 1998 (M1 of 1998) concluded applications must be refused where forestry is a discretionary use and no permit has been issued, in addition to situations where forestry is prohibited use. The effect of this conclusion was that areas of land declared a Private Timber Reserve, where a permit was required to undertake forestry under a local planning scheme, "may now be held to be legally invalid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forest Practices Board Annual Report 1997-98|publisher=Forest Practices Board|location=Hobart|pages=12|url=http://www.fpa.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/110383/FPB_1997-98_annual_report.pdf|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Private Forests Tasmania Annual Report 1997-1998|date=30 November 1998|publisher=Private Forests Tasmania|location=Hobart|pages=18|url=http://www.pft.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/131873/Annual_Report_1997-98.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legal challenge ====
In June 1997, the [[Tasmanian Conservation Trust]] sought legal advice as to the implications of Justice Crawford's judgement. Their advice maintained that where a permit for forestry use is required under a planning scheme, and has not been obtained before the land was declared a Private Timber Reserve, the declaration of the private timber reserve was illegal.

The Board of Forest Practices Authority provided a brief statement on the issue for affected people.  Private Forests Tasmania sent a letters to approximately 540 holders of Private Timber Reserves that may be affected, and all 149 current applicants (as at June 1997).  All local government authorities were also informed of the position.

In July 1997, the Government announced it would pass legislation to validate private timber reserves (media release 15 July). The Opposition also expressed support for the proposal to validate private timber reserves.

The Tasmanian Conservation Trust applied to the Resource Management and Planning Appeal Tribunal on 8 September 1997, seeking to have all Private Timber Reserves declared after the introduction of the ''Land Use Planning and Approval Act 1993''&lt;ref name = LUPAA /&gt; to be revoked.  Parties to the application were the Forest Practices Authority and [[Private Forests Tasmania]], as respondents.  A hearing was held 18 September 1997, when it was argued, and accepted, that land owners whose land had been declared as private timber reserve, post the introduction of the ''Land Use Planning and Approval Act 1993'', should be informed of the proceedings.  Private Forests Tasmania identified the land owners who could be affected by the Tribunal's decisions. A total of 980 applications, covering some 320,000 hectares, have been accepted to date (1997); with some 540 applications, involving 383 landowners, affected by any decision to revoke Private Timber Reserves approved after the introduction of ''Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993''.&lt;ref name = LUPAA /&gt;

If successful, the Trust's application could have resulted in the majority all Private Timber Reserves, approved after the introduction of ''Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993''&lt;ref name = LUPAA /&gt; (9 November 1993) to be revoked.  Some landowners may have had local government approval to undertake forestry activities prior to applying for a Private Timber Reserve, and hence would not be revoked.  Of immediate concern was that Timber Harvesting Plans&lt;ref&gt;Amendments to the Forest Practices Act in July 1999, replaced Timber Harvesting Plans with Forest Practices Plans. The current Act refers to Forest Practices Plans.&lt;/ref&gt; for areas declared as Private Timber Reserves, may be invalid, and may need local government planning permission.  Any harvesting underway on Private Timber Reserves at the time, without planning permission, would have in breach of the provisions of the ''Land Use Planning and Approval Act 1993''.&lt;ref name = LUPAA /&gt;

==== Legislative response ====
An amendment was made to ''Forest Practices Act 1985''&lt;ref name = FPA1985 /&gt; whereby a requirement to obtain a permit to undertake forestry activities under the ''Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993''&lt;ref name = LUPAA /&gt; was deemed not to be a prohibition under Section 8 2(A) of the ''Forest Practices Act 1985''.&lt;ref name = FPA1985 /&gt;

In June 1999, Royal assent was given to the ''Forest Practices (Private Timber Reserves Validation) Act 1999''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Practices (Private Timber Reserves Validation) Act 1999|url=http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;cond=ALL;doc_id=35%2B%2B1999%2BAT%40EN%2B20151016170000;histon=;prompt=;rec=;term=Private%20Timber%20Reserves|website=TheLaw|publisher=State of Tasmania|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act validated Private Timber Reserves already declared.

=== Forests Practices Tribunal (2006) ===
An appeal against the approval of a Private Timber Applications from EE &amp; IC Porter&lt;ref name="2006 TASFPT 3"/&gt; resulted in a hearing that heard evidence for 17 days.&lt;ref&gt;Hearing dates –  21, 22, 23 &amp; 24 February, 16 and 17 March; 4, 5 and 6 April; 22, 23 &amp; 24 May and 4, 14 and 25 July&lt;/ref&gt; There were six appellants Meander Valley Council, J &amp; M Hawkes, N Hoofman, PA Elkin, J Lies, J King; The appellants were all "prescribed persons" under the ''Forest Practices Act'' Section 7(4)&lt;ref name = FPA1985 /&gt; with three respondents; EE &amp; IC Porter (landowners who submitted the application, and the Forests Practices Authority who approved the application. Other parties provided submissions to the appeal: [[Private Forests Tasmania]], the Authority accepting and assessing the application; Gunns Ltd, a forestry company purchasing the wood from the landowner; The Environment Association, a local conservation group and Mr Lockhart, a local resident.

The Tribunal received 12 submissions in writing.  These submissions often included expert advice and opinion from other parties.  Each submission was then reviewed by all Appellants and Respondents, and submissions in reply lodged.  In some cases, additional expert advice was included.  During the hearing each party was then able cross examine witness, in particular expert witnesses, giving evidence.  As result, in addition to the authors of the submissions from the Appellants and Respondents (12 persons), 17 persons were subject to cross examination.&lt;ref name="2006 TASFPT 3"/&gt;

==== Findings ====
The Tribunal dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the Forest Practices Authority to approve the application.&lt;ref name="2006 TASFPT 3"/&gt;

During the hearing the appellants sought to have the decision of the Forest Practice Authority quashed because the application form for the Private Timber Reserve was not complete.&lt;ref name="2006 TASFPT 3"/&gt; The Tribunal found this did not invalidate the application.&lt;ref name="2006 TASFPT 3"/&gt;{{rp|para 267}} The application process was changed by the Private Forests Tasmania, in conjunction with Forests Practices Authority, in 2006, and a two part application form was authorised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Private Forests Tasmania Annual Report 2006-2007 |url=http://www.pft.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/131862/Annual_Report_2006-07.pdf|website=Private Forests Tasmania|publisher=Private Forests Tasmania|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
This hearing is notable due to its length, and the extensive cross examination of witnesses. The Tribunal found:

{{quotation | 284. The hearing of these appeals extended to some 17 days. Many hundreds of pages of submission were subsequently received from the parties. The length of cross examination of witnesses by many of the appellants and their representatives was a principal cause of this situation. The Tribunal, particularly because of the requirement of section 37(9)(c) that it conduct the proceedings with a little formality and technically, and with as much expedition as a proper consideration of the matter permits, ultimately limited the representative to cross examination of 60 minutes each per witness.&lt;ref name="2006 TASFPT 3"/&gt; }}

==== Appeal ====
An appellant, Mr King appealed the decision of the Tribunal to the Supreme Court pursuant to the ''Judicial Review Act 2000''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judicial Review Act 2000|url=http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;cond=ALL;doc_id=54%2B%2B2000%2BAT%40EN%2B20151102160000;histon=;prompt=;rec=;term=Judicial%20Review%20Act%202000|website=TheLaw|publisher=State of Tasmania|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Blow [[Alan Blow]] concluded that "No error of law on the part of the Tribunal", and dismissed the appeal.&lt;ref name="2007 TASSC 64"/&gt;

Mr King then lodged an appeal with the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Tasmania, where [[Chief Justice of Tasmania|Chief Justice]] [[Peter Underwood|Underwood]] and Justices [[Pierre Slicer|Slicer]] and [[Shan Tennent|Tennent]] unanimously dismissed his appeal.&lt;ref name="2008 TASSC 1"/&gt;

'''"Putnici"''' ("Travellers") was the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian and Herzegovinian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999]], performed in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[French language|French]] (the first time that Bosnia had not entered a song entirely in Bosnian) by [[Dino Merlin|Dino]] and [[Beatrice (French singer)|Béatrice]].

The song was performed twenty-second on the night, following [[Germany]]'s [[Sürpriz]] with "[[Reise nach Jerusalem - Kudüs'e seyahat]]" and preceding [[Estonia]]'s [[Evelin Samuel]] &amp; [[Imbi Rätsep|Camille]] with "[[Diamond of Night]]". At the close of voting, it had received 86 points, placing 7th in a field of 23.

The song itself is elliptical in meaning, with lyrics dealing with being travellers through life.&lt;br&gt;
The folk-inspired performance of the duo has become something of a favourite in fan circles, however, based on the fact that they were not the first-choice contestants. Bosnian band [[Hari Mata Hari]] had been selected to perform, but their intended entry "Starac i more" had already been released elsewhere (they would, however, represent the country in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 contest]]).

It was succeeded as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Eurovision Song Contest|Bosnian and Herzegovinian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001 contest]] (Bosnia having been ineligible to enter the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000 contest]]) by [[Nino Pršeš]] with "[[Hano (song)|Hano]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="962">'''Radio 100''' (former "Radio 100FM") is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[radio channel]]. The name refers to the fact that the station used to broadcast on 100.0 [[MHz]] on the [[FM broadcasting|FM spectrum]] in the [[Storkøbenhavn|Greater Copenhagen Area]].

On 18 June 2003 [[Bruun Rasmussens Kunstauktion]] held an auction where two free spaces in the [[FM broadcasting|FM]] spectrum was auctioned. One of them was bought by [[Talpa Radio International]] and on 15 November 2003 Radio 100FM aired and covered 38% of [[Denmark]].

In August 2005 Radio 100FM became the first commercial network to have a larger [[market share]] than the public station P3 owned by [[Danmarks Radio]].

'''Shia Islam in Algeria''' is composed of minority [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslim]] community of [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunni and Shia: The Worlds of Islam|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/pilgrimage-to-karbala/sunni-and-shia-the-worlds-of-islam/1737/|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2017}}

==History and culture==
Traditionally, there have been very few Shias in Algeria, except for those who were around in the [[Middle Ages]], although there are a few native Shias and some converts. Western Algeria was part of Zaydi Shia [[Idrisid dynasty]] state when [[Idris II of Morocco|Idris II]] died in 828 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Idrisid Dynasty|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Idrisid-dynasty#ref176944|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ismaili Shia [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] state originated among the [[Kutama]] people of Algeria. The dynasty was founded in 909 CE by [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah]], who in the late 9th century started a movement among the Kutama [[Berbers]] and managed to convert them to Shia [[Islam]]. In the Middle Ages local [[Berbers|Berber]] dynasties adopted Shia Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The agony of Algeria|year=1997|publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co.

'''Sky Central America and Caribbean''' is a company that operates a subscription television service in [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], and the [[Dominican Republic]]. It produces TV content, and owns several TV channels. It is one of Mexico's leading pay-TV providers and is owned by [[Televisa]] and [[Vrio (company)|Vrio]], a subsidiary of [[AT&amp;T International|AT&amp;T Latin America]].

==History==
The Mexican company was founded on 25 July 1996, a joint venture between [[Sky Limited|Sky]] (formerly [[British Sky Broadcasting]]), [[News Corporation]], [[Liberty Media]] and [[Televisa|Grupo Televisa]] and was later launched on 15 December 1996.
During the course of the decade, most Sky operations in Latin America were rebranded to [[DirecTV]], with the exception of the Mexican and Brazilian operations, which absorbed into DirecTV in 2005 but kept the Sky name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediosenmexico.blogspot.com/2007/09/octubre-de-2004-directv-se-va-de-mxico.html|title=Octubre de 2004: DirecTV se va de México.|first=Medios|last=México|date=|website=mediosenmexico.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Souvenirs from Earth (SFE)''' is an independent TV station broadcasting a 24/7 program of art films, music, installations, and performances. It is based in Germany and currently can be viewed via French, German, and Austrian cable as well as over the internet through the website's livestream and in certain public locations.

A catalog of over 3000&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, Michael. "Wandeln zwischen den Welten." Kölner Stadtanzeiger 26 May 2014: Print.&lt;/ref&gt; videos of art, experimental films, contemporary dance videos, avante garde music videos, and films of photographs are in constant motion within the channel earning it the nickname as "The MTV of Contemporary Art".&lt;ref&gt;"Transform your television into a work of art with Souvenirs from Earth TV: Interview with Marcus Kreiss." . AMA, 12 Sept. 2013. Web. 27 May 2014. &lt;http://en.artmediaagency.com/73243/transform-your-television-into-a-work-of-art-with-souvenirs-from-earth-tv-interview-with-marcus-kreiss/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Close to the ideas of [[Nam June Paik]] and [[Brian Eno]], the concept for the channel was first presented at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in 1998 and at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1999 by Marcus Kreiss. In 2006, SFE received the license to broadcast in Germany and the channel officially went on air that year. In 2008, the channel started airing in France via [[Iliad (company)]] and in 2014 the channel started broadcasting via Austrian cable through Kabel Austria and A One.

In 2009, SFE acquired a permanent installation at [[Palais de Tokyo]] and, in 2010, the channel became a residing fixture in all German airports. In 2011, the SFE was invited by the French Institute to present the channel at the Nam June Paik Center in Seoul, South Korea&lt;ref&gt;"Article of Souvenirs from Earth." . The Korean Times, 5 Oct. 2011. Web. 23 May 2014. &lt;https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2014/05/199_96123.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and while there put a show together to be viewed in Central Station on the largest LED screen in the world.

In 2007, the channel's staff added Alec Crichton, a curator from the [[Academy of Media Arts Cologne]] to manage the incoming submissions from international artists for the channel's broadcast. In 2012, Markus Kienast, a telco engineer, created the livestream and aided the station's programming software and international development while Wolfgang Kabisch, a cultural journalist, became the editor-in-chief of the channel's cultural output in 2013. In 2014, glamour girl Melissa Mourer Ordener joined the team as the official muse.

== Programming ==
SFE is an alternative approach to television and is referred to as "anti-television" or "the MTV of contemporary art". The content is submitted by artists around the world and then curated into constantly changing broadcasts. The channel has no broadcast schedule and is constantly bringing in new content, so each viewing experience is completely unique and unpredictable.

SFE programming is largely non-verbal due to the nature of video art and can be understood no matter what language the viewer speaks. SFE plans for this to appeal to a broader international audience and is the first international art channel thanks to the lack of a language barrier. The online livestream broadcasts the same content around the world so everyone is always watching the same content in real time.

The channel also gives universities the opportunity to have their own broadcast time so students can showcase their own work on the same platform as other renowned artists, such as [[Tom Sachs (artist)|Tom Sachs]], [[James Turrell]], [[Bill Viola]], and Mike Kilo. In these cases, the broadcasts adopt the title "Souvenirs from ________ " (ex. Souvenirs from Mars is the name of the broadcast from The University of Marseille).

A large portion of the broadcast is allotted to externally curated programs, often provided by young, up and coming curators, or to Carte Blanche special formats for artists (Iris Brosch, Tom Sachs…) or institutions (Art Cologne, Centre Georges Pompidou.)

SFE expands the idea of television, giving it opportunities to be viewed both actively and passively as "video paintings" through the integration with public spaces.

=== Advertisements ===
The channel refuses to have advertisements broadcast on the channel in order to maintain the integrity of the art space and viewing experience. Companies looking to have their name on the channel have the option of making an art video that can be seamlessly integrated in to the programs or the station can air an "anti-commercial" in which the station broadcasts a solid color field with the name of the company in it for 30 seconds.

Notable clients who have advertised using the channel include:
*[[Apple Inc.]]
*[[Aesop (cosmetics)]]
*Spacehair
*[[Louis Vuitton]]
*Twins for Peace
*Jeu de Paume
*[[Centre Georges Pompidou]]
*[[Art Cologne]]

== Distribution ==

SFE distributes its programming continusously:

* In France by [[Orange S.A.]] (channel 131), Free (channel 169), SFR (channel 183), and Bouygues (channel 217)
* In Germany by [[Unitymedia]] and Kabel BW
*In Austria by [[Kabel Eins]]
* Via online streaming at souvenirsfromearth.tv

==Logo==

The logo for SFE is inspired by [[In Search of Lost Time]] by [[Marcel Proust]]. In the book, there is a scene in which Proust recalls sitting in his garden and having a moment of total recall triggered by the taste of the [[madeleine (cake)]] he was soaking in his tea. Proust's writing focused on memories and the idea that our memory affects our perception of reality and SFE incorporated this iconic madeline to symbolize the artistic process in which we transform our reality. The basis of the channel is a collective memory of moments which are the created reality of the artist behind the screen. The graphic design of the madeline also recalls the icon for [[Star Trek]] and the futuristic concept of "video paintings" which were originally inspired by science fiction set designers.

'''USA-199''', also known as '''GPS IIR-18(M)''', '''GPS IIRM-5''' and '''GPS SVN-57''', is an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which forms part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the fifth of eight [[GPS Block IIRM|Block IIRM]] satellites to be launched, and the eighteenth of twenty one [[GPS Block IIR|Block IIR]] satellites overall. It was built by [[Lockheed Martin]], using the [[AS-4000]] [[satellite bus]].&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;

USA-199 was launched at 20:04:00 UTC on 20 December 2007, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D331, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Space Launch Complex 17A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-199 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star-37FM]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2rm.htm|title=GPS-2RM (Navstar-2RM)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 15 February 2008, USA-199 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|20082|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20283|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 717.98 minutes, and 54.9 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to broadcast the PRN 29 signal, and operates in slot 1 of plane C of the GPS constellation. The satellite has a design life of 10 years and a mass of {{convert|2032|kg}}.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; As of 2012 it remains in service.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2956">[[Image:XM PCR.png|thumb|right|XM PCR Receiver]]
The '''XM PCR''' is a satellite receiver sold by [[XM Radio]] and discontinued in 2004, amidst piracy concerns. Programs allowed users to record every song played on an XM channel, quickly and cheaply building an MP3 library.

== History ==
The PCR was first announced in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=11474 XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. Announces First Quarter 2003 Results] SpaceRef.Com (May 8, 2003). Press Release. Retrieved February 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, XM pulled the PCR's from the market, reportedly due to music piracy.&lt;ref&gt;C|Net News.com (August 30, 2004) [https://archive.is/20120716222304/http://news.com.com/2100-1026_3-5330698.html XM Radio pulls PC hardware amid piracy concerns]. Retrieved February 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, that didn't stop demand: Some units were reportedly selling for more than US$300 on [[eBay]]. As of February 2007, prices settled down to around US$30–50.

== Enhancements ==
Several enhancements have been created for the PCR, both software and hardware. In the software arena, '''PCR Replacement''' programs have been sprouting up on Internet forums and web sites. These are software packages that replace the interface included with the PCR, XMMT. Several features have been added to these new programs, including the ability to [[Radio music ripping|rip]] songs and build an MP3 library, [[Time shifting|time shift]] shows so that the user can listen at a more convenient time, control the radio via a web browser, and stream audio to other computers. Some web sites also offer a playlist log, which allows a user to browse a list of all the recently played songs or shows.

A hardware modification has also been discovered that allows the addition of a [[TOSLINK]] optical output, allowing users to connect the PCR to the optical digital input on a home theater receiver.

== Replacements ==
[[Image:XM Direct.png|thumb|right|XM Direct Receiver with homemade Smart Cable]]
The XM Direct receiver, also marketed as the XM Commander, can now serve the same purpose as the PCR. While the XM Direct is intended for automotive use, the unit itself is controlled by [[RS-232]] command signals, and so is easily adapted to PC control. When combined with a "smart cable", which is really just a [[USB]] to Serial cable and a wiring adapter to connect to the XM Direct's control port, the XM Direct supports some features not found on the original PCR.

The XM Mini tuner may also hold promise for hardware tweakers. It uses the newest XM tuner and is much smaller than the XM Direct. Like the Direct, the Mini is designed to be used with an external system, in this case a home theater receiver. Unlike the Direct, the Mini is also capable of receiving XM's newest technologies, including HD audio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xmradio.com/hd/index.xmc XM HD Surround Sound]&lt;/ref&gt;
