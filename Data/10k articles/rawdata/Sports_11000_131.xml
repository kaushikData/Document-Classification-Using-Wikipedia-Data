'''Volleybalclub Aquacare Halen''' is a [[volleyball]] club based in [[Halen]], [[Belgium]]. 

The men's A squad currently plays in the [[Liga Heren|Liga]], the highest level of Belgian men's volleyball. The club has been there since 2002. Their best league position was 5th, achieved in 2004-05, 2006-07 and 2007-08. Because of this, the team has already played three times in the [[Challenge Cup (volleyball)|Challenge Cup]], formerly known as CEV Cup.

The club was founded in 2002 as a result of a merger between Schuvoc Herk-de-Stad en Halen VC. Those two teams also were the result of earlier mergers.

The men's B and C squad, as well as the three women's teams, play in the lower, [[Limburg (Belgium)|provincial]] leagues.

== History ==

The competition kicked off for the first time on Wednesday, 11 March 2009 inaugurated by [[Citycell]]'s Chief Executive Officer Michel Seamour and the Federation's president [[Kazi Salahuddin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|title=Citycell Super Cup Football Flying start for Abahani |work=The New Nation |url=http://www.ittefaq.com/issues/2009/03/12/news0893.htm |doi= |accessdate=2010-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713070527/http://www.ittefaq.com/issues/2009/03/12/news0893.htm |archivedate=13 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Mohammedan Sporting Club (Dhaka)|Mohammedan Sporting Club]] became the first champion beating arch-rival [[Abahani Limited Dhaka|Abahani Limited]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4615">A '''bowl-out''' (sometimes termed a '''bowl-off''') is used in various forms of [[limited overs cricket]] to decide a match that would otherwise end in a [[result (cricket)#Tie|tie]].  The procedure is similar to a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] in [[association football|football]].  Five bowlers from each side deliver one or two balls each at an unguarded [[wicket]] (three [[stump (cricket)#Part of the wicket|stumps]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mott, Oliver [http://static.ecb.co.uk/files/cct20-rules-2009-final-10524.pdf CCT20 Rules 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928113842/http://static.ecb.co.uk/files/cct20-rules-2009-final-10524.pdf |date=2011-09-28 }}, 7 May 2009, [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]]. Retrieved on 31 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;   If each team has hit the same number of wickets after the first five bowlers per side, the bowling continues and is decided by [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]].

==History==
===First match decided by bowl-out===
A bowl-out was first used in the [[NatWest Trophy]] in June 1991 in a match between Derbyshire and Minor County side Hertfordshire at Bishops Stortford. Derbyshire bowled first and Steve Goldsmith managed one hit from his two deliveries. Ole Mortensen, Alan Warner, Frank Griffiths and Simon Base all missed with both of theirs. 
Hertfordshire's first bowler, Andy Needham, hit with his first ball but missed with his second. John Carr  missed with both of his, but Bill Merry struck middle with his second attempt to win the match.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===International Cricket===
The [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) introduced the bowl-out should scores be tied in the semifinals and final of the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy]] or the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], although it was not required to be used in either tournament. At the ICC Annual Conference 2008 it was decided that the bowl-out should be replaced by a one-over "eliminator" (also called a "[[Super Over]]") in the [[2009 ICC Champions Trophy|2008 ICC Champions Trophy]] (postponed to 2009) and the [[2009 ICC World Twenty20]].

==Twenty20==
===International T20===
Up until the introduction of the "[[Super Over]]" in [[Twenty20 International|International Twenty20]] cricket, if a match ended with the scores level (either because both teams reached the same score after 20 [[over (cricket)|overs]], or the second team scored exactly the par score under the [[Duckworth-Lewis method]]), the tie was broken with a bowl-out.  The first international bowl-out in a Twenty20 match took place on 16 February 2006, when [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] beat [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] 3-0 in [[Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/4715558.stm Kiwis defeat Windies in bowl out] ([[BBC News]], 16 February 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=6&amp;click_id=17&amp;art_id=qw1140085801198S163 Black Caps win first-ever bowl-off] ([[Independent Online]], 16 February 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; 
A bowl-out was also used on 14 September 2007 when [[India national cricket team|India]] beat [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] 3-0 during the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]] in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/6993851.stm India defeat Pakistan in bowl-out] ([[BBC News]], 14 September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic T20===
A bowl-out was first used to decide a domestic Twenty20 match when Surrey beat Warwickshire in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/counties/4693841.stm Surrey beat Bears after bowl-out] ([[BBC News]], 18 July 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Current use==
In some forms of domestic one-day cricket competition, a bowl-out is used to decide the result when the match is tied or rained out: for example, the quarterfinal of the [[MCCA Knockout Trophy|Minor Counties Cricket Association Knockout Trophy]] in 2004, when [[Northumberland County Cricket Club|Northumberland]] beat [[Cambridgeshire County Cricket Club|Cambridgeshire]] 4-2.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/sport/2004/07/09/scmino09.xml Holders feel blue after bowl-out] (''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 9 July 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2009 Twenty20 Cup]], [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] beat [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] 5-1 to reach the semi-final stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/counties/8176034.stm Somerset beat Lancs in bowl-out], 30 July 2009, [[BBC Sport]]. Retrieved on 31 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Club San Martín''' is a [[sports club]] based in [[Corrientes, Argentina]]. The [[basketball]] team currently plays in the Torneo Nacional de Ascenso (TNA), the second division of the Argentine [[Liga Nacional de Básquetbol]] league system.

==History==
San Martín was founded by some management leaders of former club '''9 de Julio''', which had recently closed. Those men decided to create an institution which functioned as a social place where people could meet and practise sports.

Dr. Antonio Peluffo was proclaimed as first President of San Martín. In the beginning the club hosted diverse activities such as [[basketball]], [[tennis]], [[track and field]], [[table tennis]] and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]].

One year after (1933) San Martín acquired the lands for setting up its headquarters (in the corner of Salta and Moreno streets), which remains the same nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanmartincorrientes.com.ar/?page_id=145 Historia del Club - Sitio oficial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016071759/http://sanmartincorrientes.com.ar/?page_id=145 |date=2011-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''complete glucose breakdown''' is a series of [[chemical reaction]]s representing transformation of [[glucose]] to [[adenosine triphosphate]] during the normal phases of aerobic [[cellular respiration]]. It is mostly done inside the [[mitochondria]] to release the maximum amount of [[energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=IegDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT85&amp;lpg=PT85&amp;dq=%22Complete+glucose+breakdown%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=baAPaQWShn&amp;sig=r2pN9OCCkJZpbJLpjaUrm92louM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjslYCl-7XcAhXLEywKHQw7C2Y4ChDoATANegQICRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Complete%20glucose%20breakdown%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pyruvate]] is made from glucose during the [[glycolysis]] and transformed to an [[acetyl group]] during transition reaction. The [[acetyl]] group is used in the [[Krebs cycle]] and the phase ends with the [[electron transport chain]].

The '''Cumbria Shield''' is an annual [[rugby union]] knock-out club competition organized by the [[Cumbria Rugby Union]].  It was introduced during the 1888-89 season, when it was known as the Cumberland Challenge Shield, and the inaugural winners were [[Millom RUFC|Millom]].  Initially it was open only to junior club sides in [[Cumberland]] (senior sides played in the [[Cumbria Cup|Challenge Cup]]) but in 1974, as a result of the [[1972 Local Government Act]], Cumberland, [[Westmorland]] and [[Furness]] merged to form what we now know as [[Cumbria]], and the competition would ultimately be renamed as the Cumbria Shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/sports/cumbriarl/history.html|title=History|publisher=Angelfire|accessdate=10 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the third most important cup competition in Cumbria, behind the [[Cumbria Cup]] and [[Cumbria League Cup]].

Originally the Shield was a knock-out cup played by the 1st teams of junior clubs, along with the 2nd teams of senior clubs, before becoming mostly a 2nd team competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/article/Cumbria-Shield-second-team-tournament-set-for-revival-af744bfd-5728-4552-a551-d9390f44dd2e-ds|title=Cumbria Shield second team tournament set for revival|publisher=News &amp; Star|date=29 May 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In later years the format switched back and forth between a knock-out cup and league cup-hybrid, but has most recently switched to being awarded to the winners of the Cumbria Shield League - a regional league for 2nd and 3rd teams in Cumbria.  A secondary competition known as the Cumbria Vase was introduced in 2007 initially for sides knocked out of the early rounds of the Shield competition, although in recent years it seems to have become a stand-alone cup competition for 2nd teams in the region.

[[File:Gluconeogenesis.png|thumb|Simplified Gluconeogenesis Pathway]]
'''Gluconeogenesis''' ('''GNG''') is a [[metabolic pathway]] that results in the generation of [[glucose]] from certain non-[[carbohydrate]] carbon substrates. From breakdown of [[protein]]s, these substrates include [[glucogenic amino acid]]s (although not [[ketogenic amino acid]]s); from breakdown of [[lipid]]s (such as [[triglyceride]]s), they include [[glycerol]], odd-chain fatty acids (although not even-chain fatty acids, see below); and from other steps in [[metabolism]] they include [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] and [[lactic acid|lactate]].

Gluconeogenesis is one of several main mechanisms used by humans and many other animals to maintain [[blood sugar|blood glucose levels]], avoiding low levels ([[hypoglycemia]]). Other means include the degradation of [[glycogen]] ([[glycogenolysis]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Silva |first=Pedro |title=The Chemical Logic Behind Gluconeogenesis |url=http://www2.ufp.pt/~pedros/bq/gng.htm |accessdate=September 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826043311/http://www2.ufp.pt/~pedros/bq/gng.htm |archivedate=August 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fatty acid metabolism#Fatty acid catabolism|fatty acid catabolism]].

Gluconeogenesis is a ubiquitous process, present in plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, and other microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry |year=2000 |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=USA |isbn=1-57259-153-6 |page=724 |author1=David L Nelson |author2=Michael M Cox }}&lt;/ref&gt; In vertebrates, gluconeogenesis takes place mainly in the [[liver]] and, to a lesser extent, in the [[renal cortex|cortex]] of the [[kidney]]s. In [[ruminants]], this tends to be a continuous process.&lt;ref name="pmid320235"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Young JW | title = Gluconeogenesis in cattle: significance and methodology | journal = J. Dairy Sci. | volume = 60 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | year = 1977 | pmid = 320235 | doi = 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(77)83821-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many other animals, the process occurs during periods of [[fasting]], [[starvation]], [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s, or intense [[exercise]].  The process is highly [[endergonic]] until it is coupled to the hydrolysis of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] or [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]], effectively making the process [[exergonic]]. For example, the pathway leading from [[pyruvate]] to [[glucose-6-phosphate]] requires 4 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of GTP to proceed spontaneously. Gluconeogenesis is often associated with [[ketosis]]. Gluconeogenesis is also a target of therapy for [[type 2 diabetes]], such as the [[antidiabetic drug]], [[metformin]], which inhibits glucose formation and stimulates glucose uptake by cells.&lt;ref name = Hundal&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hundal RS, Krssak M, Dufour S, Laurent D, Lebon V, Chandramouli V, Inzucchi SE, Schumann WC, Petersen KF, Landau BR, Shulman GI | title = Mechanism by Which Metformin Reduces Glucose Production in Type 2 Diabetes | journal = Diabetes | volume = 49 | issue = 12 | pages = 2063–69 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11118008 | pmc = 2995498 | doi = 10.2337/diabetes.49.12.2063 }} {{cite web|url= http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/reprint/49/12/2063 |title=Free full text }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(82&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[ruminant]]s, because dietary carbohydrates tend to be metabolized by [[rumen]] organisms, gluconeogenesis occurs regardless of fasting, low-carbohydrate diets, exercise, etc.&lt;ref name=Beitz2004/&gt;

Lactate is transported back to the liver where it is converted into [[pyruvate]] by the [[Cori cycle]] using the enzyme [[lactate dehydrogenase]]. Pyruvate, the first designated substrate of the gluconeogenic pathway, can then be used to generate glucose.&lt;ref name = Garrett&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Biochemistry with a Human Focus |last=Garrett |first=Reginald H. |author2=Charles M.

Whether even-chain [[fatty acid]]s can be converted into glucose in animals has been a longstanding question in biochemistry.&lt;ref name = Figueiredo&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Figueiredo LF, Schuster S, Kaleta C, Fell DA | title = Can sugars be produced from fatty acids?

In plants, specifically seedlings, the [[glyoxylate cycle]] can be used to convert fatty acids ([[acetate]]) into the primary carbon source of the organism. The glyoxylate cycle produces four-carbon dicarboxylic acids that can enter gluconeogenesis.&lt;ref name = Garrett/&gt;

In 1995, researchers identified the glyoxylate cycle in [[nematode]]s.&lt;ref name = Liu&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu F, Thatcher JD, Barral JM, Epstein HF | title = Bifunctional glyoxylate cycle protein of ''Caenorhabditis elegans'': a developmentally regulated protein of intestine and muscle | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 169 | issue = 2 | pages = 399–414 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7781887 | doi = 10.1006/dbio.1995.1156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the glyoxylate enzymes [[malate synthase]] and [[isocitrate lyase]] have been found in animal tissues.&lt;ref name = Kondrashov&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kondrashov FA, Koonin EV, Morgunov IG, Finogenova TV, Kondrashova MN | title = Evolution of glyoxylate cycle enzymes in Metazoa: evidence of multiple horizontal transfer events and pseudogene formation | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 1 | page = 31 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17059607 | pmc = 1630690 | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-1-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genes coding for malate synthase have been identified in other [[metazoan]]s including [[arthropod]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, and even some [[vertebrate]]s.

Genes for isocitrate lyase are found only in nematodes, in which, it is apparent, they originated in [[horizontal gene transfer]] from bacteria.

The existence of glyoxylate cycles in humans has not been established, and it is widely held that fatty acids cannot be converted to glucose in humans directly.

[[File:Gluconeogenesis pathway.png|thumb|300px|Gluconeogenesis pathway with key molecules and enzymes. Many steps are the opposite of those found in the [[glycolysis]].]]

==Pathway==
Gluconeogenesis is a pathway consisting of a series of eleven enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The pathway will begin in either the liver or kidney, in the mitochondria or cytoplasm of those cells, this being dependent on the substrate being used. Many of the reactions are the reverse of steps found in [[glycolysis]].
* Gluconeogenesis begins in the mitochondria with the formation of oxaloacetate by the carboxylation of pyruvate. This reaction also requires one molecule of [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], and is catalyzed by [[pyruvate carboxylase]]. This enzyme is stimulated by high levels of [[acetyl-CoA]] (produced in [[β-oxidation]] in the liver) and inhibited by high levels of ADP and glucose.
* Oxaloacetate is reduced to [[malate]] using [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]], a step required for its transportation out of the mitochondria.
* Malate is oxidized to oxaloacetate using NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the cytosol, where the remaining steps of gluconeogenesis take place.
* Oxaloacetate is decarboxylated and then phosphorylated to form [[phosphoenolpyruvate]] using the enzyme [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase|PEPCK]]. A molecule of [[guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] is hydrolyzed to [[guanosine diphosphate|GDP]] during this reaction.
* The next steps in the reaction are the same as reversed [[glycolysis]].  However, [[fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase]] converts [[fructose 1,6-bisphosphate]] to [[fructose 6-phosphate]], using one water molecule and releasing one phosphate (in glycolysis, [[phosphofructokinase 1]] converts F6P and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to F1,6BP and [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]]).  This is also the rate-limiting step of gluconeogenesis.
* [[Glucose-6-phosphate]] is formed from [[fructose 6-phosphate]] by [[phosphoglucoisomerase]] (the reverse of step 2 in glycolysis). Glucose-6-phosphate can be used in other metabolic pathways or dephosphorylated to free glucose. Whereas free glucose can easily diffuse in and out of the cell, the phosphorylated form (glucose-6-phosphate) is locked in the cell, a mechanism by which intracellular glucose levels are controlled by cells.
* The final reaction of gluconeogenesis, the formation of glucose, occurs in the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], where glucose-6-phosphate is hydrolyzed by [[glucose-6-phosphatase]] to produce glucose and release an inorganic phosphate. Like two steps prior, this step is not a simple reversal of glycolysis, in which [[hexokinase]] catalyzes the conversion of glucose and ATP into G6P and ADP. Glucose is shuttled into the cytoplasm by [[glucose transporter]]s located in the endoplasmic reticulum's membrane.

==Regulation==
While most steps in gluconeogenesis are the reverse of those found in [[glycolysis]], three regulated and strongly endergonic reactions are replaced with more kinetically favorable reactions. [[Hexokinase]]/[[glucokinase]], [[phosphofructokinase]], and [[pyruvate kinase]] enzymes of glycolysis are replaced with [[glucose-6-phosphatase]], [[fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase]], and [[PEP carboxykinase]]/pyruvate carboxylase.  These enzymes are typically regulated by similar molecules, but with opposite results.  For example, [[acetyl CoA]] and [[citrate]] activate gluconeogenesis enzymes (pyruvate carboxylase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, respectively), while at the same time inhibiting the glycolytic enzyme [[pyruvate kinase]].  This system of reciprocal control allow glycolysis and gluconeogenesis to inhibit each other and prevents a [[futile cycle]] of synthesizing glucose to only break it down.

The majority of the [[enzymes]] responsible for gluconeogenesis are found in the [[cytosol]]; the exceptions are mitochondrial [[pyruvate carboxylase]] and, in animals, [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase]]. The latter exists as an isozyme located in both the [[mitochondrion]] and the [[cytosol]].&lt;ref name="pmid15917397"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chakravarty K, Cassuto H, Reshef L, Hanson RW | title = Factors that control the tissue-specific transcription of the gene for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-C | journal = Crit.

Global control of gluconeogenesis is mediated by [[glucagon]] (''released when blood glucose is low''); it triggers phosphorylation of enzymes and regulatory proteins by [[Protein kinase A|Protein Kinase A]] (a cyclic AMP regulated kinase) resulting in inhibition of glycolysis and stimulation of gluconeogenesis. [[Insulin]] counteracts glucagon by inhibiting gluconeogenesis.

==Track and field==
An hexathlon in [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] is an event which consists of six [[track and field]] events. The word "hexathlon" derives from the Greek words hexa, the number 6, and athlos, meaning contest. A hexathlon is not often organized, mostly at youth levels. It was on the program of the [[Central American and Caribbean Age Group Championships in Athletics]] until 2007, [[South American Youth Championships in Athletics]] until 1998 and the [[South American Junior Championships in Athletics]] until 1974.

The word hexathlon is also used for other forms of combined contests, like bridge, gaming, workouts, etc..

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11120">{{About|the golf shot}}
In [[golf]], a '''hole in one''' or '''hole-in-one''' (also known as an '''ace''', mostly in [[American English]]) occurs when a ball hit from a [[teeing ground|tee]] finishes in the cup. This awards the player a score of one for the hole due to the fact that it took them one stroke to get the ball in the hole, but the score would be higher if the player is making a second shot from the tee due to a lost ball, out of bounds or water hazard.

Holes in one most commonly occur on [[par (score)|par]] 3 holes, the shortest distance holes on a standard size golf course. Longer hitters have also accomplished this feat on longer holes, though nearly all par 4 and par 5 holes are too long for golfers to reach in a single shot. While well known outside of golf and often requiring a well hit shot and significant power, holes in one needs also a significant element of [[luck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Halley|first1=Jim|title=With holes in one, no matter how you slice them luck is vital|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/golf/2006-07-16-hole-in-one_x.htm|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oscarson|first1=Paul|title=Top 10 Craziest Holes-in-One|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1693444-top-10-craziest-holes-in-one|publisher=The Bleacher Report|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they are more common and considered less impressive than other hole accomplishments such as completing a par 5 in two shots (an [[Par (score)#Albatross|albatross]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Bill |last=Fields |url=http://www.golfdigest.com/majors/masters/index.ssf?/majors/masters/gw20040402albatross.html |title=The Rarest Bird: The albatross took flight at the 1935 Masters, but golf's most unlikely shot isn't easy to find |magazine=[[Golf World]] |date=April 2, 2004 |accessdate=February 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305063301/http://www.golfdigest.com/majors/masters/index.ssf?%2Fmajors%2Fmasters%2Fgw20040402albatross.html |archivedate=March 5, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of |October 2008}}, a [[Par (score)#Condor|condor]] (four under par) hole-in-one on a par 5 hole had been recorded on four occasions, aided by thin air at high altitude, or by cutting the corner on a doglegged or horseshoe-shaped hole.&lt;ref name=Condor01/&gt;&lt;ref name=Condor02/&gt;

Holes-in-one ("aces") are also recorded in [[disc golf]]. The current world record for disc golf's longest hole in one is held by Brent Bell, who set the record at the 2002 [[Big Sky State Games]] at the Diamond X Disc Golf Course in [[Billings, Montana]].

==Rarity==
Holes in one are rare, and, although skill definitely increases the probability, there is a great element of luck involved.&lt;ref name=odds&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holeinoneinsurance.com/hole-in-one-odds.html |title=What Are The Odds of Making a Hole In One? |publisher=US Hole In One |accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is traditional for a player who has scored a hole in one to buy a round of drinks for everyone at the clubhouse bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/07/golfers-hit-hole-in-ones-within-seconds-of-each-other/ |title=Golfers Hit Hole-In-Ones Within Seconds of Each Other |publisher=ABC News |date=July 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the memorable holes in one, one occurred in the [[1973 Open Championship|1973 British Open]] when at age 71, [[Gene Sarazen]] made a hole in one. Earl Dietering of Memphis, Tennessee, 78 years old at the time, is believed to hold the record for the eldest person to make a hole-in-one twice during one round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It's a pair of aces for senior golfer |publisher=The Commercial Appeal |first=Phil |last=Stukenborg |date=April 20, 2012 |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2012/apr/20/its-a-pair-of-aces-for-senior-golfer/ |accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second round of the 1971 [[Martini International]] tournament, held at the Royal Norwich Golf Club in England, [[John Hudson (golfer)|John Hudson]] had two consecutive holes in one. Teeing off, using a 4-iron, at the par-three, 195-yard 11th hole, Hudson holed his tee shot for a hole-in-one. At the next hole, the downhill 311-yard, par-four 12th, and this time using a driver, he once again holed his tee shot, for another ace. This is believed to be the only time a player has scored holes-in-one at consecutive holes in a major professional tournament.&lt;ref name=guinness&gt;{{cite book |title=Golf: Records, Facts and Champions |first=Donald |last=Steel |authorlink=Donald Steel |publisher=Guinness Superlatives Ltd. |year=1987 |isbn=0-85112-847-5 |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alliss&gt;{{cite book |title=The Who's Who of Golf |first=Peter |last=Alliss |authorlink=Peter Alliss |publisher=[[Orbis Publishing]] |year=1983 |isbn=0-85613-520-8 |page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the relative rarity of holes in one, there have been a total of six in [[Ryder Cup]] matches. [[Peter Butler (golfer)|Peter Butler]] scored the first in [[1973 Ryder Cup|1973]] at [[Muirfield]] followed by a 20-year gap before [[Nick Faldo]] scored a hole in one in [[1993 Ryder Cup|1993]]. [[1995 Ryder Cup|Two years later]], [[Costantino Rocca]] and [[Howard Clark (golfer)|Howard Clark]] both scored holes in one before an 11-year gap to [[2006 Ryder Cup|2006]] saw [[Paul Casey]] and [[Scott Verplank]] both hole out in one on the 14th hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=6 Ryder Cup Hole In Ones |url=http://www.mdhio.net/6-ryder-cup-hole-in-ones/ |accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 11, 2016, [[Justin Rose]] shot a hole in one during the first round of the golf tournament of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in Rio de Janeiro, which is considered to be the first in Olympic history. For the 189 yards 3-par hole, he used a 7-iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.golfdigest.com/story/justin-rose-makes-the-first-hole-in-one-in-olympics-golf-history|title=Justin Rose makes the first hole-in-one in Olympics golf history - Golf Digest|last=Myers|first=Alex|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitions==
Occasionally special events host a hole in one contest, where prizes as expensive as a new car, or cash awards sometimes reaching $4 million are offered if a contestant records a hole in one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/stories/2006/02/27/focus2.html |title=Hole-in-one insurance policies provide safety net for glitzy tournament contests | first=Chris |last=Harris |date=February 26, 2006 |accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually such expensive prizes are backed by an [[insurance]] company who offers [[prize indemnity insurance|prize indemnification services]]. [[Actuary|Actuaries]] at such companies have calculated the chance of an average golfer making a hole in one at approximately 12,500 to 1, and the odds of a tour professional at 2,500 to 1.&lt;ref name=odds/&gt;

==Holes-in-one on par 5 (or higher) holes==
{{outdated section|date=September 2016}}
As of October 2008, a [[Par (score)#Condor|condor]] (four under par) hole-in-one on a par 5 hole had been recorded on four occasions, aided by thin air at high altitude, or by cutting the corner on a doglegged or horseshoe-shaped hole.&lt;ref name=Condor01&gt;"Condor", GolfToday.co.uk, 2010, webpage (dated October 2008):    [http://www.golftoday.co.uk/golf_a_z/articles/condor.html GT-condor].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Condor02&gt;{{cite web|title=Has There Ever Been a Hole-in-One on a Par-5 Hole?|url=http://golf.about.com/od/faqs/f/par5aces.htm |first=Brent |last=Kelley |publisher=[[About.com]] Golf|accessdate=August 24, 2014|quote=One was even recorded with a '''3-iron'''! That one was made by Shaun Lynch, playing at Teign Valley Golf Club in Christow, England, in 1995, on the 496-yard No. 17. According to a 2004 article in Golf World magazine, Lynch aimed straight toward the green on a '''horseshoe''' par-5, clearing a 20-foot-high hedge, then hitting a downslope on the other side. The downslope carried his ball to the green and into the cup.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A horseshoe-shaped par 5 hole once enabled a condor hole in one to be achieved with a 3-iron club.&lt;ref name=Condor01/&gt;&lt;ref name=Condor02/&gt; The longest recorded straight drive hole-in-one is believed to be {{convert|517|yd|m|0|disp=or}}, on the par 5 No. 9 hole at Green Valley Ranch Golf Club in [[Denver]] in 2002, aided by the thin air due to the high altitude.&lt;ref name=Condor01/&gt;&lt;ref name=Condor02/&gt; None of these four par 5 holes-in-one were achieved during a professional tournament.&lt;ref name=Condor01/&gt; A condor is also known as a double albatross, or a triple eagle.&lt;ref name=Condor01/&gt;&lt;ref name=Condor02/&gt;

==Kim Jong-il myth==
Over a period of several years, many U.S. and European media outlets &amp;ndash; including [[ESPN]] and the ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jere|last=Longman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/sports/remembering-kim-jong-ils-ventures-into-the-sporting-world.html?_r=0|title=Kim Jong-il, the Sportsman |work=New York Times |date=20 December 2011 |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – reported that former North Korean Supreme Leader [[Kim Jong-il]] was claimed to have shot five holes in one during his first attempt at playing [[golf]] (an alternate version of the story claims North Korean media once reported Kim had shot 18 holes in one). This is explained as a case of the North Korean government assigning supernatural feats of [[heroism]] to its leaders as part of an effort to perpetuate a [[cult of personality]]. This myth was originally published by Eric Ellis, a reporter for the [[Australian Financial Review]], as having been told by a [[Pyongyang Golf Course|Pyongyang Golf Club]] professional in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ericellis.com/archivenorthkorea1-htm/ |title=Dear Leader and The Golf War |last1=Ellis |first1=Eric|date=22 October 2012 |website=ericellis.com |publisher=Eric Ellis  |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NK News]] reports that "informal surveys of North Koreans themselves revealed that no one in [[Pyongyang]] was aware of this legendary feat, unless told it by a tourist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nknews.org/2012/12/the-top-ten-most-bizarre-rumours-to-spread-about-north-korea/ |title=The top ten most bizarre rumours to spread about North Korea |last1=Abrahamian |first1=Andray|date=6 December 2012 |website=nknews.org |publisher=NK News |accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Seers, a British journalist who played at the Pyongyang Golf Club asked officials there, who revealed it was nothing more than an urban myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golfclubmanagement.net/2011/12/kim-jong-ils-golf-feat-an-urban-myth/ |title=Kim Jong Il’s golf feat an 'urban myth' |first=Alistair |last=Dunsmuir |date=December 20, 2011 |work=Golf Club Management |accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the first North Korean female gymnast to win a medal at the Olympics.&lt;ref name=firstgymmedal&gt;{{cite web|title=North Korea Gymnastics |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/PRK/summer/GYM/ |website=sports-reference |accessdate=20 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620202229/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/PRK/summer/GYM/ |archivedate=20 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
She was an individual event finalist on the [[Vault (gymnastics)|vault]] at the [[2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2007 World Championships]] and the bronze medalist on the event at the 2006 [[Asian Games]].

Hong represented North Korea at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing, where she won the gold medal in the [[Gymnastics at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Women's vault|women's vault]] competition. This was the first Olympic medal for [[North Korea at the Olympics|a North Korean woman]] in [[Olympic gymnastics]].&lt;ref name=firstgymmedal /&gt;

Hong won the gold medal in vault at the [[2013 Summer Universiade]] in [[Kazan]] (tied with Russian gymnast [[Ksenia Afanasyeva]]) and is the bronze medalist on vault at the [[2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2013 World Championships]].

The following year she won the vault final at the [[2014 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]]. She performed the two most difficult vaults in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/gymnastics/story/_/id/11679659/hong-un-jong-denies-simone-biles-3rd-gold-gymnastics-worlds |title=Simone Biles denied third gold |date=11 October 2014 |website=ESPN |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Hong again represented North Korea at the [[2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] held in [[Glasgow]]. Though she retained her full difficulties and performed impressively, she failed to defend her title and won a silver medal instead. She was behind Russia's [[Maria Paseka]] by 0.033 point. At the 2016 Summer Olympics, she qualified second into vault finals behind Simone Biles. In the finals she performed a solid Cheng to start. For her second vault, she became the first female gymnast to ever attempt a triple twisting yurchenko vault; however she under rotated and sat down the vault, getting the vault devalued to an Amanar, and ultimately missed the podium.

== Age controversy ==
{{further|Hong Su-jong#2010 age controversy}}
Hong Un-jong is the younger sister or possibly twin sister of [[Hong Su-jong]]. Hong Su-jong had three different birth dates listed for her (1985, 1986, or 1989) at various competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Amanda|title=North Korean Gymnast's Age Under Dispute|url=http://www.intlgymnast.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1937:north-korean-gymnasts-age-under-dispute&amp;catid=2:news&amp;Itemid=53|website=International Gymnast Magazine|accessdate=20 June 2015|date=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], she competed under the 1985 birth date, but the 1989 birth date would have meant that she was too young to compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One Woman, Three Birthdays|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/sports/03sportsbriefs-northkorea.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|publisher=The Associated Press|accessdate=20 June 2015|date=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010 Hong Su-jong was banned from all competition out of North Korea for inconsistent age information for two years. North Korea was also banned from all international competition until October 2012 due to this incident, and North Korea could not send any gymnasts to the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London 2012 Olympics: North Korean gymnasts suspended for age falsification|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/8114590/London-2012-Olympics-North-Korean-gymnasts-suspended-for-age-falsification.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=20 June 2015|date=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Kirk Gibson]]'s 1988 World Series home run''' occurred in Game 1 of the [[1988 World Series]], on October 15, {{mlby|1988}}, at [[Dodger Stadium]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Gibson, [[pinch hitter|pinch hitting]] for the [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the bottom of the ninth [[inning (baseball)|inning]], with injuries to both legs, hit a two-run [[Walk-off home run|walk-off]] [[home run]] off the [[1988 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]]' [[Dennis Eckersley]] that won Game 1 for the Dodgers by a score of 5&amp;ndash;4.

After winning the [[National League]] [[National League West|West]] division, the Dodgers were considered the [[underdog (competition)|underdogs]] throughout the 1988 postseason, first to the [[1988 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] in the [[1988 National League Championship Series|NLCS]], then to the A's in the World Series. Gibson, who was not expected to play due to injuries in both legs sustained during the NLCS, was surprisingly inserted as a [[pinch hitter]] with the Dodgers trailing 4&amp;ndash;3 with two [[out (baseball)|out]]s and the tying run at first base in the bottom of the ninth inning. Gibson's home run&amp;mdash;his only [[plate appearance]] of the series&amp;mdash;helped the Dodgers defeat the A's, 4 games to 1, securing their sixth [[World Series]] title.

The play has since become legendary in the baseball world, and is regarded as one of the greatest home runs of all time.&lt;ref name="Time.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1650858_1650857_1650844,00.html|title=Historic Home Runs: Kirk Gibson's World Series Walk-off Home Run|publisher=Time.com|accessdate=2009-03-30 | date=2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was voted the "greatest moment in L.A. sports history" in a 1995 poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/15/sports/sp-gibson15|title=Reliving the moment of home run by Dodgers' Kirk Gibson, 20 years later|last=Mitchell|first=Houston|date=2008-10-15|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the images associated with the home run, particularly Gibson pumping his fist while circling the bases, are often shown in classic highlight reels, usually accompanied by [[Vin Scully]] or [[Jack Buck]]'s call. Though not related to his World Series home run, Gibson would be named the 1988 NL [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]]. He was named to two [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] teams (1985 in the AL, and 1988 in the NL), but declined both invitations.

==Background==

===Regular season===
[[File:Orel Hershiser 1993.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Orel Hershiser]] would be named the 1988 [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|World Series MVP]].]]
The Dodgers signed [[outfielder]] Kirk Gibson as a [[free agent]] during the 1988 offseason. Gibson, who played the previous nine seasons with the [[Detroit Tigers]] (winning a World Series title with them in [[1984 World Series|1984]]), quickly became the Dodgers' de facto leader both on the field and off. On the field, Gibson led the team with 25 home runs, a .290 [[batting average]] and 31 stolen bases.

The [[1987 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]], who had only finished 4th in the [[National League West]] in [[1987 Major League Baseball season|1987]] with a 73–89 ({{winpct|73|89}}) record (17 games behind the division winning [[1987 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]]), led the NL West division standings from late May until the end of the season, easily winning the division title with a record of 94&amp;ndash;67 ({{winpct|94|67}}), seven games ahead of the second-place [[1988 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]].

One reason why the Dodgers were considered underdogs throughout the postseason was that they did not finish the regular season ranked in the top five of any major offensive statistical category. However, they were strengthened by an excellent [[starting pitcher|starting rotation]] led by ace [[Orel Hershiser]] and backed up by [[Tim Belcher]], [[John Tudor (baseball)|John Tudor]] and [[Tim Leary (baseball)|Tim Leary]]. They also had an outstanding [[bullpen]] that included [[Jay Howell]], [[Jesse Orosco]] and [[Alejandro Peña]].

===Postseason===
Their opponent in the [[1988 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] was the [[1988 New York Mets season|New York Mets]], who had compiled a more impressive 100&amp;ndash;60 ({{winpct|100|60}}) regular season record, and had won 10 of their 11 regular-season meetings with the Dodgers. The NLCS was a surprisingly close contest given the outcomes of the two teams' regular season meetings. Gibson's heroics in the series included an improbable catch on wet grass in Game 3 and decisive home runs in Games 4 and 5. The series went to a deciding Game 7, which the Dodgers won in stunning fashion on the back of Hershiser's 5 hit shutout to earn their first [[World Series]] trip since [[1981 World Series|1981]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN198810120.shtml 1988 NLCS Game 7 Box Score]&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson injured his left hamstring while stealing second base in Game 5 and his right knee while sliding into second base in Game 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suchon|first1=Josh|title=Miracle Men: Hershiser, Gibson, and the Improbable 1988 Dodgers|date=2013|publisher=Triumph Books|location=Chicago|isbn=9781600788062|page=216-217|chapter=NLCS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chass1989"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chass|first1=Murray|title=Baseball; Gibson Still Bothered by Knee|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/24/sports/baseball-gibson-still-bothered-by-knee.html|accessdate=14 August 2017|work=The New York Times|date=24 February 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After defeating the Mets, the Dodgers faced the [[1988 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in the [[1988 World Series|World Series]]. Oakland had compiled a 104&amp;ndash;58 ({{winpct|104|58}}) regular season record (the best in the Majors), and boasted a powerful lineup led by sluggers [[Jose Canseco]] and [[Mark McGwire]], and complemented by the likes of [[Dave Henderson]], [[Dave Parker]] and [[Don Baylor]]. The A's, who also boasted 20 game winner [[Dave Stewart (baseball)|Dave Stewart]] (himself a former Dodger from 1978-1982) and [[Closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Dennis Eckersley]] who had saved 45 games during the regular season, had easily accounted for [[Boston Red Sox|Boston]] in the [[1988 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], sweeping the Red Sox 4–0.

==The setup==

===World Series Game 1===
Gibson injured both legs during the NLCS, and therefore did not start Game 1. Los Angeles took an early lead on an improbable two-run home run by [[Mickey Hatcher]] in the first inning. The next inning, however, Canseco hit a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] to give Oakland a two-run lead. Oakland's lead was cut to one run when [[Mike Scioscia]] hit an [[RBI]] [[single (baseball)|single]] in the sixth inning that scored [[Mike Marshall (outfielder)|Mike Marshall]].

[[File:Mike Davis 1986.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Mike Davis (baseball)|Mike Davis]], shown here with Oakland, drew a walk ahead of Gibson's at bat, and was on base as the Dodgers' potential tying run.]]
Unknown to the fans and the media at the time, Gibson was watching the game on television while undergoing physical therapy in the Dodgers' clubhouse.&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2008-10-06-gibson-88homer_N.htm|title=Kirk Gibson's 1988 home run still a World Series highlight|last=Lopresti|first=Mike|date=2008-10-08|work=USA Today|accessdate=2009-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some point during the game, television cameras scanned the Dodgers [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]] and commentator [[Vin Scully]], working for [[NBC]] for the 1988 postseason, observed that Gibson was "nowhere to be found".&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt; This spurred Gibson to tell Dodgers [[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Tommy Lasorda]] that he was available to [[pinch hitter|pinch hit]].&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt; Gibson immediately returned to the [[batting cage]] in the clubhouse to take practice swings.&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt;

With a one-run lead, Oakland [[closing pitcher|closer]] [[Dennis Eckersley]], who led the AL with 45 saves during the regular season, was brought in to close out the game and seal the win for starter [[Dave Stewart (baseball)|Dave Stewart]]. Eckersley quickly got Scioscia to pop out to [[shortstop]] and struck out [[Jeff Hamilton (baseball)|Jeff Hamilton]]. Left-handed [[pinch hitter]] [[Mike Davis (baseball)|Mike Davis]] followed; if he got on base the next batter due was the pitcher's spot, which would certainly be filled with a pinch hitter. Not wanting the A's to realize that Gibson was available, Lasorda sent [[Dave Anderson (infielder)|Dave Anderson]] to the on-deck circle during Davis' plate appearance.&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt; According to Lasorda, A's catcher [[Ron Hassey]] got Eckersley's attention and pointed at Anderson on-deck.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lasorda|first1=Tom|title=Gibson's homer in Lasorda's words|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/16/sports/sp-lasorda16|accessdate=14 August 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=16 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular story is that Eckersley pitched around Davis because the A's thought that the light-hitting Anderson was the next batter.  Hassey vehemently denied that the A's pitched carefully to Davis because Anderson was on deck: "Why would we pitch around Davis when we have two outs?  You don't pitch around a guy with two outs to face another hitter.  That would never make sense.  You have your closer out there.  That's just not true.  That's a good story.  As far as I know, Gibson is on the roster.  Is he not?  You're not going to waste a guy that can't play.  He's active."  Eckersley decided to pitch around Davis because he had seen him hit 20 home runs for the A's before the All-Star break the previous year.  Instead of risking making a mistake that Davis could hit for a game-tying home run, Eckersley pitched carefully and did in fact [[base on balls|walk]] him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suchon|first1=Josh|title=Miracle Men : Hershiser, Gibson, and the Improbable 1988 Dodgers|date=2013|publisher=Triumph Books|location=Chicago|isbn=9781600788062|page=245-246|chapter=World Series Game 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The play==
[[File:Dodger Stadium.jpg|thumb|[[Dodger Stadium]], where the home run was hit.]]

Instead of sending Anderson to the plate, Lasorda inserted Gibson as his pinch hitter. Gibson hobbled up to the plate with Scully commenting, ''"And look who's coming up!"'' Gibson quickly fouled off two pitches, getting behind in the [[Count (baseball)|count]], 0&amp;ndash;2. He then swung clumsily and dribbled the ensuing pitch foul down the first base line, which seemed to confirm his inability to swing with any authority. Gibson took an outside pitch, called a ball by home plate umpire [[Doug Harvey (umpire)|Doug Harvey]], fouled off a pitch, and then took another outside pitch to work to a 2&amp;ndash;2 count. 

On the seventh pitch of the [[at bat]]—another ball, making it a [[full count]]—Davis [[stolen base|stole]] second. Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda later recounted it was pre-planned that if the count got to two strikes on Gibson, they would have Davis steal second, figuring that A's manager [[Tony La Russa]] wouldn't elect to [[Intentional walk|intentionally walk]] Gibson if there were already two strikes against him. Once Davis was at second, Lasorda was just hoping Gibson could muscle a pitch to the outfield for a game-tying single.&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt;

Gibson would later recount that prior to the Series, Dodger scout [[Mel Didier]] had provided a report on Eckersley which claimed that with a 3&amp;ndash;2 count against a [[left-handed]] hitter, one could be absolutely certain that Eckersley would throw a [[List of baseball jargon (B)#backdoor breaking ball|backdoor]] [[slider]].&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt; Gibson said that when the count reached 3&amp;ndash;2, he stepped out of the batter's box and, in his mind, could hear Didier's voice, with its distinctive [[Southern American English#Phonology|Southern drawl]], reiterating that same piece of advice.&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt; With that thought in mind, Gibson stepped back into the batter's box; and thus when Eckersley did in fact throw a backdoor slider, it was exactly the pitch Gibson was expecting.

Swinging almost entirely with his upper body, Gibson then hit the pitch over the right-field fence. He limped around the bases and pumped his fist as his teammates stormed the field. The Dodgers won the game, 5&amp;ndash;4.

Gibson did not have another plate appearance in the World Series. The Dodgers went on to defeat the A's in the World Series, 4–1.

==The calls==

===[[Don Drysdale]]===
{{quote|Well, the crowd on its feet and if there was ever a preface, to "[[Casey at the Bat]]," it would have to be the ninth inning. Two out. The tying run aboard, the winning run at the plate, and Kirk Gibson, standing at the plate.

Gibson, a deep sigh ... re-gripping the bat ... shoulders just shrugged ... now goes to the top of the helmet, as he always does ... steps in with that left foot. Eckersley, working out of the stretch ... here's the three-two pitch ... and a drive hit to right field (voice changes to high pitch) WAY BACK! THIS BALL ... IS GONE! (After delay) This crowd will not stop! They can't believe the ending! And this time, Mighty Casey did NOT strike out!}}

===Vin Scully===
[[File:Scully GM.JPG|thumb|right|[[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] television announcer [[Vin Scully]]]]
{{quote|All year long, they looked to him to light the fire, [Scully began]}}  {{quote|and all year long, he answered the demands, until he was physically unable to start tonight&amp;mdash;with two bad legs: The bad left hamstring, and the swollen right knee. And, with two out, you talk about a roll of the dice... this is it.}}

Scully, calling the play-by-play for the [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]]-TV (as previously mentioned) broadcast with [[color commentator]] [[Joe Garagiola, Sr.|Joe Garagiola]], made repeated references to Gibson's legs, noting at one point that the batter was {{quote|shaking his left leg, making it quiver, like a horse trying to get rid of a troublesome fly.}}

Gibson worked the count to 3&amp;ndash;2 as Mike Davis stole second base; the camera turned at that point to [[Steve Sax]] getting ready for his turn at the plate, and Scully reminded the viewers that {{quote|Sax waiting on deck but the game right now is at the plate.}}

{{quote|High fly ball into right field, she i-i-i-is... GONE!!!}}

Scully said nothing for over a minute, allowing the pictures to tell the story.  Finally, he said, {{quote|In a year that has been so improbable... the ''impossible'' has happened!}}

Returning to the subject of Gibson's banged-up legs during a replay, Scully joked, {{quote|And, now, the only question was, could he make it around the base paths unassisted?!}}

{{quote|You know, I said it once before, a few days ago, that Kirk Gibson was not the Most Valuable Player; that the Most Valuable Player for the Dodgers was [[Tinkerbell]]. But, tonight, I think Tinkerbell backed off for Kirk Gibson. And, look at Eckersley&amp;mdash;shocked to his toes!}}

{{quote|They are going wild at Dodger Stadium&amp;mdash;no one wants to leave!}}

As NBC showed a replay of Gibson rounding second base in his home run trot, Scully then made a point to note Eckersley's pitching performance throughout the 1988 season, to put things in perspective.

 {{quote|Dennis Eckersley allowed five home runs all year.  And we'll be back.}}

===Jack Buck===
[[File:Jackbuck.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Major League Baseball on CBS Radio|CBS Radio]] announcer [[Jack Buck]]]]
[[Major League Baseball on CBS Radio|CBS]] handled the national radio broadcast of the 1988 World Series, with [[Jack Buck]] providing play-by-play and [[Bill White (first baseman)|Bill White]] as the analyst. This was Buck's call. It begins here with Buck speculating on what might happen if Gibson manages to reach base:

{{quote|... then you would run for Gibson and have Sax batting. But, we have a big 3&amp;ndash;2 pitch coming here from Eckersley. Gibson ''swings'', and a fly ball to deep right field! ''This is gonna be a home run!!!'' Unbelievable! A home run for Gibson! And the Dodgers have won the game, five to four; I don't believe what I just saw!!!}}

The last sentence is often remembered and quoted by fans. Buck followed it with, {{quote|I don't ''believe'' what I just saw! Is this really happening, Bill?}}

Buck concluded his comments on Gibson's amazing feat with this thought:
{{quote|One of the most remarkable finishes to any World Series Game...a one-handed home run by Kirk Gibson! And the Dodgers have won it...five to four; and I'm stunned, Bill. I have seen a lot of dramatic finishes in a lot of sports, but this one might top almost every other one.}}

==Aftermath==

Much was made about Eckersley's decision to throw an offspeed pitch to Gibson, with Joe Garagiola repeatedly noting that Gibson clearly couldn't catch up to a fastball. To his credit, Eckersley fielded every reporters' question after the game, mostly blaming himself. Years later, he recalled, "Somebody said that the Dodgers knew I threw a backdoor slider on 3&amp;ndash;2. I don’t know if that’s true or not. I didn’t get to 3&amp;ndash;2 that often, but if that’s what the guy told him [Gibson], if that’s what he had on his mind, good for him. Either way, it was a terrible slider."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/mlb/strike-zone/2013/10/15/kirk-gibson-dennis-eckersley-dodgers-athletics-1988-world-series-home-run-oral-history# |title='That was a cool feeling': An oral history of Kirk Gibson's iconic 1988 home run |publisher=''Sports Illustrated'' |date=October 15, 2013 |accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The home run was included as a finalist in a Major League Baseball contest to determine the sport's "Greatest Moment of All-Time." For years after the fact, it was regularly used in ''[[This Week in Baseball]]'s'' closing montage sequence. An edited audio of Scully's 1988 call has been used in {{By|2005}} post-season action, in a TV ad featuring a recreational softball game, with a portly player essentially re-enacting that entire moment as he hits the softball over the right field fence to win the game. It was in competition on [[ESPN]]'s ''[[SportsCenter]]'' for the Greatest Sports Highlight of All-Time.

By the time Gibson returned to his locker for postgame interviews, Dodger bullpen coach Mark Cresse had taped the name of Roy Hobbs over Gibson's nameplate, in reference to Gibson's heroics mirroring those of the film slugger that [[Robert Redford]] had played in ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]''. Like Hobbs in the film's climactic scene, Gibson had represented the winning run when he came to the plate, had been down to his (and the team's) final strike and had homered to right field to win the game. NBC's pregame video for Game 2 narrated by [[Bob Costas]] included both the home run and its film counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/75729831 1988 World Series Game 1 Recap (Game 2 Pregame): Kirk Gibson in ''The Natural''] Vimeo (originally broadcast by NBC)&lt;/ref&gt;

The fate of the ball itself is unknown. According to Gibson, a woman sent him a picture of the bruise on her leg where the ball hit her, although no one has yet come forward with the ball.&lt;ref name="Time.com"/&gt; In fiction, a court struggle over the ownership of the ball was the primary plot of the June 29, 2011, episode of [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] legal drama ''[[Franklin &amp; Bash]]''.

Near the end of the Major League Baseball season in the fall of 2011, [[Chevrolet]] began airing commercials for their Diamond &amp; Dream's Program, a giveaway designed to help the youth in their communities around the country. Prizes included a makeover for their baseball field. The commercials showed selected little league baseball players acting out some of baseball's greatest moments in history. One of them being Kirk Gibson's famous home run from the 1988 World Championship run of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The young boy acting out this moment could be seen running the bases, doing the same fist pump motion that Gibson was seen doing during his famous run around the bases.

The structure, tone, and overall style of [[Ernest Thayer]]'s famous poem "[[Casey at the Bat|Casey at the Bat: A Ballad of the Republic Sung in the Year 1888]]"—first published in 1888 and "the single most famous baseball poem ever written" according to the [[Baseball Almanac]]&lt;ref name=Almanac&gt;{{cite web|title=Casey at the Bat by Ernest Thayer|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_case.shtml|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;—was [[literary adaptation|adapted]] by Michael J. Farrand in 2000 to create "The Man Who Gave All the Dreamers in Baseball Land Bigger Dreams to Dream" about the Gibson home run, but this time reversing the infamous outcome.  This adaptation appears at the Baseball Almanac. Farrand's choice of poetic model was prompted by the observation of [[Mike Scioscia]], then the Dodger catcher: "It was 'Casey at the Bat,' except this time Casey hits a home run."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jul/24/sports/sp-hall24 More Than That One Pitch: Eckersley, who gave up Gibson's '88 homer, makes Hall as the dominant closer of his era.]" BASEBALL HALL OF FAME Induction ceremony, Sunday, 10:30 a.m., ESPN Classic; July 24, 2004 by Bill Shaikin for Los Angeles Times&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, Gibson said: "It really was not that bad a pitch, and I put an ugly swing on it." In the words of the poem:
:Eck winds, curls, and releases the ball, all without a hitch
:Gibby's swing is something ugly, an army-wristy stab
:His wrenching follow-through suggests he won't survive the jab.

In Game 4 of the [[2018 World Series]], 30 years after that 1988 World Series walk-off home run, Eckersley and Gibson reunited for the ceremonial first pitch at [[Dodgers Stadium]]; Gibson had a bat ready before catching Eckersley's pitch.&lt;ref&gt;https://sports.yahoo.com/kirk-gibson-dennis-eckersley-reunite-30-years-later-world-series-first-pitch-002825561.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Madagascar]]''' first entered the Olympic Games in 1964 and has sent athletes to every games apart from [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] and [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]]. The largest group they ever sent to an Olympics games was 10 back in [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] They have never won a medal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.buzzfeed.com/mikemehalick/the-10-most-populated-countries-to-never-win-an-ol&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous Malagasy athlete to appear at the Olympics is [[Jean-Louis Ravelomanantsoa]], who reached the final of the men's 100 metres in the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metres|1968 Summer Olympics]], finishing eighth. Madagascar appeared for the Winter Games for the first time in 2006.

'''Memorial Stadium,''' also known as the "'''Brick House'''", was an outdoor athletic stadium in the [[West North Central States|north central]] [[United States]], on the campus of the [[University of Minnesota]] in [[Minneapolis]].  It was the home of the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota Golden Gophers]] [[college football|football]] team for 58 seasons, from 1924 through 1981. Prior to  1924, the Gophers played at [[Northrop Field]]. 

Starting in 1982, the Gophers played their home games in the new [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]], and Memorial Stadium was demolished a decade later.  After 27 seasons indoors, the Gophers returned to campus in [[2009 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|2009]] at the new [[TCF Bank Stadium]], a block from the site of Memorial Stadium.

==History==
Opened on October 14, 1924, the stadium was dedicated to the 3,527 students, graduates, and workers who served in [[World War I]], which had ended six years earlier. It sat on approximately {{convert|11|acre}}. 

While Memorial park was its home, the football team won six [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|national championships]] including three consecutive (1934–1936). The championship years were 1934, 1935, 1936, 1940, 1941, and 1960. The [[seating capacity|official capacity]] of the stadium during the 1970s was listed as 56,652. From the 1940s onward, temporary bleachers were occasionally brought in to boost capacity to approximately 66,000, though many of the seats were far away from the field.  The stadium's attendance record was 66,284, set in 1961 against [[Purdue University|Purdue]] on November 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gophersports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=39277&amp;SPID=3280&amp;DB_OEM_ID=8400&amp;ATCLID=275768 Memorial Stadium Information from Gophersports.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005032616/http://www.gophersports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=39277&amp;SPID=3280&amp;DB_OEM_ID=8400&amp;ATCLID=275768 |date=2009-10-05 }} The official athletic site of the University of Minnesota&lt;/ref&gt;

Memorial Stadium also served as the university's track and field venue, and was an occasional back-up venue for professional football and soccer. In [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|1969]], the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] played a regular season game on October 5 against the [[1969 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] at Memorial Stadium.  It was due to a conflict with a [[1969 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] playoff game at [[Metropolitan Stadium]], game three of the [[1969 American League Championship Series]] the following day. The Vikings also played a pre-season game at Memorial in [[1971 Minnesota Vikings season|1971]], its second season with [[artificial turf]]. The artificial Tartan Turf was removed after seven seasons and returned to natural grass in 1977.&lt;ref name=ergtrtf&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FKNVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mtkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2690%2C4583725 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |location=Oregon |agency=UPI |title=Tartan Turf to be replaced |date=February 18, 1977 |page=8D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Minnesota Kicks]] soccer team of the [[North American Soccer League|NASL]] played once at Memorial Stadium, a 1981 playoff game on September 6 against the [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (1977–83)|Fort Lauderdale Strikers]] and lost 3-0. The game was moved due to a schedule conflict with the [[1981 Minnesota Twins season|Twins]] at Met Stadium.

[[Ancel Keys]] founded the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene underneath Memorial Stadium, on the ground floor accessed at Gate 27. Here thirty-six [[conscientious objector]]s were confined during the yearlong [[Minnesota Starvation Experiment]].&lt;ref name=Kalm_2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kalm L, Semba R |title=They starved so that others be better fed: remembering Ancel Keys and the Minnesota experiment |journal=J Nutr |volume=135 |issue=6 |pages=1347–52 |year=2005 |pmid=15930436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Starvation Experiment: Ancel Keys and the Men Who Starved for Science|year=2008|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-5161-0|author=Tucker, Todd|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Memorial Stadium served as the anchor for [[Stadium Village]], a small commercial area at the southeast portion of the Twin Cities campus.

==Move to Metrodome 1982==
Pressured by downtown Minneapolis business interests and athletic boosters, the school elected to move out of the stadium to the new Metrodome, about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) away, during the spring of 1982. Athletic director [[Paul Giel]] cited the advantages of recruiting by playing in a new NFL venue. Also, the attendance was expected to go up in the late fall with protection from harsh  weather.&lt;ref name="unfair"&gt;Brackin, Dennis - [Memorial Stadium: An unfair end? {{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/gophers/55900867.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909045839/http://www.startribune.com/sports/gophers/55900867.html |archivedate=2009-09-09 |df= }}] Star Tribune, September 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium had been neglected by this time, and was badly in need of renovation.&lt;ref name="unfair" /&gt; New coach [[Lou Holtz]] gave an impassioned speech when the time came in 1984 to decide whether to remain at the Metrodome, and declared that "Athletes want to play at the Dome."&lt;ref name="unfair"/&gt;

==University Aquatic center==
Following the move, the University of Minnesota proposed a new [[natatorium]] that would extend into the field at the open end of the horseshoe and ensure that there could be no return to Memorial Stadium.  After legal challenges to halt construction of the natatorium failed, the Aquatic Center opened in 1990 and the stadium was torn down two years later.  The original brick entrance arch was preserved, and when the [[McNamara Alumni Center]] was built on the same site it was installed in the interior atrium over the entrance to a small museum.

==Aftermath==
The move to the Metrodome proved to be a dismal failure in the long run, as Gophers home games lost the charm of being on a college campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The university also gave up most concession and parking revenue, although their portion of the rent was the lowest of the three Metrodome tenants.

On May 20, 2006, the [[Minnesota Legislature|state legislature]] passed a bill providing funding for a new on-campus stadium. It opened in the fall of 2009 as [[TCF Bank Stadium]]. The original Memorial Stadium site could not be used, due to the construction of the aquatic and alumni centers. The new stadium is located about a block from where the old stadium once stood, and was designed so that the alumni center on the old site is visible through the open end of the horseshoe.

They have held this trophy aloft 34 times in all, more than any other club in the Connacht,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and they have won the senior league 16 times. They won the Dudley Cup for the first time in 1905. 
They have had many successes down through the years, but a real highlight was the 1962/63 season when they swept the boards — they won the Connacht Minor League and Minor Cup, the Connacht Junior League and Junior Cup, the Connacht Senior League and Senior Cup, the OLBC Sevens and the Blake Sevens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Kenny|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/60129/ucg-rugby-club|title=UCG Rugby Club|work=[[Galway Advertiser]]|date=11 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808051832/http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/60129/ucg-rugby-club|archivedate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of their players have played for Irish universities international teams, and 10 have been capped for Ireland, several while playing for UCG. One of those, Ciaran Fitzgerald, captained the British and Irish Lions.

Currently NUIG do not compete in the [[All-Ireland League (rugby union)|All-Ireland League]], but they field two teams at Junior level (J1B &amp; J2) and their under-20 team plays in the Conroy Cup against UCC, UCD, QUB, and TCD, along with competing in the Under-20 JP Fanagan Leinster League. They have also set up a Rugby Youth Academy in an attempt to help strengthen the club.

The women's team was set up in the 2002-2003 season. Their first official game was in 2004 versus Sligo I.T. In the 2008/2009 season NUIG women won the Connacht League. In the 2012/2013 season NUIG contested the [[Colleges &amp; Universities Sports Association of Ireland]] Div 1 College League Final against UL. In 2013/2014 and again in 2014/2015 NUIG won the [[Irish Universities Rugby Union]] Kay Bowen Intervarsity Cup.

'''Peter Charney''' (born 2 October 1989) is the current [[Guinness World Record]] holder for the most indoor [[bungee jump]]s in twenty-four hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Going For Guinness |publisher=TIME |date=November 12, 2006 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1558323,00.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121224912/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1558323,00.html |archivedate=January 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Most Bungee Jumps in 24 hours (indoors)|publisher=Guinness World Records |date=November 6, 2007|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-4000/most-bungee-jumps-in-24-hours-(indoors)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charney first attempted the record in November 2006 as part of the Guinness World Records Day. During that attempt he completed 106 jumps in 24 hours, setting a new Guinness World Record. Due to facility issues he was forced to have a 10-hour extended break.

He completed his second successful attempt on 6&amp;ndash;7 November 2007 in the [[West Edmonton Mall]] World Waterpark, [[Edmonton, Canada]]. After 23 hours he reached his goal of 225 jumps&amp;mdash;averaging nine jumps per hour and up to 32 in one hour.

Both of his attempts were in support of a local charity and raised just over $5000.

A '''pin''', or '''fall''', is a victory condition in various forms of [[sport wrestling|wrestling]] that is met by holding an opponent's [[shoulder]]s or [[scapula|scapulae (shoulder blades)]] on the wrestling mat for a prescribed period of time. This article deals with the pin as it is defined in [[amateur wrestling]].

In amateur wrestling, a pin ends the match regardless of when it occurs. Situations which are almost pins but for whatever reason do not meet the criteria—for example, have only one shoulder down or have the defending wrestler blocked in a neck bridge—are rewarded with exposure points (in collegiate wrestling, known as near fall points or back points) in order to encourage wrestlers to take risks to try to pin their opponents.

==Conditions for a pin==
===In the international styles===

In  [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco Roman]] and [[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] wrestling, the two shoulders of the defensive wrestler must be held long enough for the referee to "observe the total control of the fall" (usually ranging from one half-second to about one or two seconds). Then either the judge or the mat chairman concurs with the referee that a fall is made. (If the referee does not indicate a fall, and the fall is valid, the judge and the mat chairman can concur together and announce the fall.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], for the Kids' Freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling division (wrestlers ages 8 to 14) in competitions sponsored by [[USA Wrestling]], it is specified that a fall must be held for two seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Pinning techniques==
===Half nelson===

In the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeBVmatmtYY half-nelson], the attacking wrestler is on top of the opponent on the ground with both wrestlers face down; a [[nelson hold#Half nelson|half nelson]] can be used to turn the opponent over. The attacker's arm is pushed below the opponent's shoulder from the outside, and across and behind the opponent's neck. The attacker's arm lifts the opponent's shoulder while the attacker's hand presses his neck down; simultaneously the attacker drives forward perpendicularly to the opponent's body to roll him over onto his back. With the opponent on his back and the attacker perpendicular to him chest-on-chest, the attacker tightens his arm around the opponent's neck, often also controlling the opponent's lower body by hooking the free arm in the opponent's crotch or around the near or far thigh.

===Three-quarter nelson===

In a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_H2V9wa1as three-quarter nelson], one arm again goes under the opponent's shoulder and behind his neck to press it down, but in addition the attacker's other arm goes under the opponent's body from the same side, across the body to the other side of the neck, and up the other side of the neck to lock with the first hand behind the neck and press down. Again the attacker drives forward to roll the opponent over; once that is accomplished, the attacker can convert to a half nelson or, if the attacker's leg has hooked behind the opponent's knee, the three-quarter nelson can be maintained to accomplish the pin.

===Cradle===

A [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzQHGQWRjT4 cradle] is a move where the attacker performs the cradle by grabbing the neck of his opponent with one arm, and wrapping the elbow of the other arm behind the knee of the opponent. The wrestler then locks both hands together, forcing the opponent's knee toward his face, and rolls the opponent over onto his back. The hooked leg can be either the near leg (a "near-side cradle") or the far leg (a "far-side cradle").

===Arm bar or chicken wing===
In this move, the top wrestler, just to his opponent's left, grasps the opponent's left elbow with his left hand, putting his right arm on his waist in front of his right hip. He quickly pull his left arm out while still holding onto it. He pushes him down with his body, using his right knee to push him forward and off-balance. He then grabs his right wrist with the right hand and pulls it outward. His belly is now down on the mat, legs flat. The aggressor is above the opponent with his chest several inches above his back. The aggressor's left knee holds up most of his own body weight. The aggressor's right leg is extended between his legs with the ball of the foot on the floor. The aggressor curls his wrist, then encloses the opponent's left arm inside the aggressor's left elbow joint. With the aggressor's chest is resting on the opponent's left elbow, he uses his body to push his left shoulder into his ear, using both legs for leverage. He slowly moves his feet into a walking position while crouched, walking in a circle and rolling the opponent over onto his back without releasing his arms. The pin is finished by the aggressor  leaning on his knees with his chest toward the floor.

===Guillotine===

A [[guillotine (wrestling)|guillotine]] is initiated when both wrestlers are face down on the mat, the attacker on top of the opponent. The attacker hooks one leg around the opponent's same-side leg, also hooking the ankle with the foot. The attacker reaches across to grab the arm opposite to the side that the leg ride is on. This arm is pulled back and up to allow the attacker to slip his head under it, at or just above the elbow. (The guillotine is most easily applied if the opponent is reaching back during the leg ride.) The attacker uses his head to lift and turn the arm and opponent. The attacker's leg-hook-side arm is applied under the opponent's arm and behind his head in a similar fashion to a half nelson. The attacker rolls backward to roll the opponent is onto his back, and the attacker locks his hands around the opponent's neck.

{{outdated|date=April 2017}}
In [[baseball]], a '''pinch hitter''' is a substitute [[Batting (baseball)|batter]]. Batters can be substituted at any time while the [[dead ball (baseball)|ball is dead]] (not in active play); the [[manager (baseball)|manager]] may use any player who has not yet entered the game as a substitute. Unlike [[basketball]], [[American football]], or [[ice hockey]], baseball does not have a "free substitution rule" and thus the replaced player in baseball is not allowed back into that game. The pinch hitter assumes the spot in the batting order of the player whom he replaces.

The player chosen to be a pinch hitter is often a backup infielder or outfielder. In the major leagues, catchers are less likely to be called upon because most teams have only two catchers, while pitchers are almost never used as pinch-hitters, because they tend to be worse hitters than other players on the team. The pinch hitter may not re-enter the game after being replaced with another player.

The [[American League]] of [[Major League Baseball]], the [[Pacific League]] in [[Japan]], the [[KBO League]] in [[South_Korea|Korea]], and various other leagues use the [[designated hitter]] rule, such that pitchers seldom bat. This removes one possible situation where a pinch hitter may be desired.

For [[baseball statistics|statistical]] and [[baseball scorekeeping|scorekeeping]] purposes, the pinch hitter is denoted by '''PH'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=McMahon |editor-first=Rob |date=2009 |title=USA Today Baseball Scorebook |publisher=Sterling Innovation |page=11 |isbn=978-1-4027-6245-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Pinch hitters are often used to replace a starting player when the pinch hitter is thought to have a better chance of reaching base or helping other runners to score.

In the [[National League]] of [[Major League Baseball]], the [[Central League]] in [[Japan]], and various other [[minor league]]s, pinch hitters are often substituted for the [[pitcher]] in the middle or late innings of a game. This is because pitchers are often poor hitters and get tired after six to seven innings of pitching. Thus, as the manager often plans to replace the pitcher in the next inning, the major downside of using a pinch hitter, namely that the player being replaced cannot re-enter the game, is taken away.

This use of a pinch hitter is often part of a [[Double switch (baseball)|double switch]], in which a [[relief pitcher]] replaces a defensive player who will not bat soon, and at the same time a defensive player replaces the pitcher who is scheduled to bat soon.

The pinch hitter may remain in the game following a pinch-hit at-bat and need not (but may) assume the same position as the player for whom he pinch-hits as long as some other player assumes that position. For example, on 16 August 2009, the [[Washington Nationals]]' [[Ryan Zimmerman]] pinch-hit for second baseman [[Alberto González (baseball)|Alberto Gonzalez]] and then remained in the game at third base, with previous third baseman [[Ronnie Belliard]] switching positions to play second base after the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=290816117|title=Nationals vs. Reds - Box Score - August 16, 2009 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the manager may designate another player to replace the pinch-hitter; this scenario is common when a team pinch-hits for a pitcher without executing a double switch, such that the new pitcher then replaces the pinch hitter and assumes the previous pitcher's place in the batting order.

If a pinch hitter hits for the [[Designated hitter|DH]], the new pinch hitter stays in the game as a DH, and may not be used in the field. If the new DH does take the field, then the team forfeits the DH.

A '''rookie''' is a person in the first year of activity in a sport, or someone new to a profession, training, or activity such as a rookie police officer, rookie pilot, a recruit, or occasionally a [[freshman]].

==Throughout sports==
{{expand section|date=December 2011}}
In some sports there are [[traditions]] in which rookies must do things, or tricks are played on them. Examples in baseball include players having to dress up in very strange costumes, or getting hit in the face with a cream pie; a traditional rookie's "[[hazing]]" procedure in [[American football]] involves taping players to a [[goalpost]] and dousing them with ice water, Gatorade, and other substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martinez|first1=Jose|title=The Most Humiliating NFL Rookie Hazings|url=http://www.complex.com/sports/2013/08/nfl-rookie-hazings/|website=complex.com|accessdate=January 20, 2018|date=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Birdsong|first1=Nick|title=Ronald Darby taped to goal post, doused with water in Bills' rookie hazing ritual|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/news/bills-rookie-hazing-ronald-darby-taped-goalpost-doused-water-nfl/bixwuas3vzof1vx3ic14m8a3y|website=sportingnews.com|accessdate=January 20, 2018|date=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Major League Baseball, the MLB has cracked down on hazing by enacting an Anti-Hazing and Anti-Bullying Policy which prohibits players from dressing up as the opposite sex, or wearing offensive costumes based on race, sex, nationality, age, sexual orientation, and gender identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Justice|first1=Richard|title=Anti-hazing, anti-bullying policy appropriate|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/baseball-implements-anti-hazing-policy/c-211026968|website=mlb.com|accessdate=January 18, 2018|date=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American football===
In the [[National Football League]] a rookie is any player who is in their first season in the NFL. The NFL awards the best rookie with the [[Associated Press NFL Rookie of the Year Award]], as voted upon the [[Associated Press]]. In the NFL, rookies have special contract rules which limit how much a team can pay them as well as limiting the length of the contract, as per stipulations laid out in the [[NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Nate|title=NFL, players announce new 10-year labor agreement|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2011/07/reports-nfl-players-agree-to-new-collective-bargaining-agreement/1#.WmPk6pM-dfR|website=content.usatoday.com|publisher=USAToday|accessdate=January 20, 2018|date=July 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lariviere|first1=David|title=NFL Rookie Contracts Show Owners Were The Winners In CBA|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidlariviere/2012/07/04/nfl-rookie-contracts-show-owners-were-the-winners-in-cba/#3fb6458152b3|website=forbes.com|accessdate=January 20, 2018|date=July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auto racing===
[[File:Scott Speed Pep Boys Auto 2009 001.jpg|thumb|[[Scott Speed]]'s car with the yellow rookie stripes]]
NASCAR and INDYCAR rookies are denoted by a yellow stripe on sections of the car as prescribed in the respective rule books. In NASCAR, the rookie stripe is located on the tail panel of the race car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jayski.com/news/stats/2014/story/_/page/2014-NASCAR-Sprint-Cup-Sunoco-Rookie-of-the-Year|title=2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Sunoco Rookie of the Year|work=[[Jayski's Silly Season Site]]|accessdate=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NASCAR====

The following rules are for rookie status in a national series:
* Must have run no more than five (prior to 2001 in Cup and Xfinity, and in the Truck Series for age-eligible drivers), seven (2001–10, Cup and Xfinity), and have been declared to race for driver points in that series (2011–present), races in any previous season.
**In the Camping World Truck Series, a driver who is 17 at the start of the season and does not make ten starts overall is eligible in his first full season after turning 18.  Truck Series drivers who are 16 and 17 may only participate in nine races during the season based on circuits.
* Drivers who compete in more than five races in a higher NASCAR-sanctioned series are not eligible for the award in a lower series if they have not declared for the higher series.
* If a driver does not start eight races before the end of Race 20 on the schedule, they will immediately become ineligible to earn rookie points for the rest of that season and starting in 2011, remained declared for that series. Drivers may change series declaration in order to avoid this.
* A driver may not receive rookie points if they start a race for a team that they did not qualify with. However, they are still eligible for championship points in that race.

====INDYCAR====

The following rules are for rookie status in the Verizon IndyCar Series:
*  Must not have participated in more than three Verizon IndyCar Series races in a season.  
*  A veteran driver in the Indianapolis 500 may still be a Series Rookie if he has not competed in more than three series races overall.
*  A driver who has never raced in the Indianapolis 500 but has made a legal season of Verizon IndyCar Series races is still an Indianapolis 500 rookie in his first start.

===Baseball===
To qualify as a rookie in [[Major League Baseball]], a player must not have exceeded 130 [[at bat]]s or fifty [[innings pitched]] in the majors, and also fewer than 45 days on the active rosters of major league clubs (excluding time on the disabled list or any time after rosters are expanded on September 1) in their previous seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/about_mlb/rules_regulations.jsp|title=MLB Miscellany: Rules, regulations and statistics|publisher=Major League Baseball|accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major League Baseball awards the best rookie with the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award]], as voted upon by the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]].

===Basketball===
In the [[National Basketball Association]], a rookie is any player who has never played a game in the NBA until that year.  The NBA awards the best rookie with the [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]], as voted upon by a selected panel of United States and Canadian sportswriters and broadcasters. In the NBA, rookies have special contract rules which limit how much a team can pay them as well as limiting the length of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jessop|first1=Alicia|title=The Structure of NBA Rookie Contracts|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciajessop/2012/06/28/the-structure-of-nba-rookie-contracts/#1d6014ff7299|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=January 20, 2018|date=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ice hockey===
To qualify as a rookie in the [[National Hockey League]], a player must not have played 25 regular season games or more in any single season. As of the 1990-91 NHL season, a player also must be 26 years old or younger to qualify as a rookie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHL Calder Memorial Trophy Winners|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-calder-memorial-trophy-winners-complete-list/c-287749198|website=NHL.com|accessdate=January 20, 2018|date=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hockey Operations Guidelines|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26377|website=NHL.com|accessdate=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Hockey League awards the best rookie with the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]], as voted upon by the [[Professional Hockey Writers' Association]]. In the NHL, rookies have special contract rules which limit how much a team can pay them as well as limiting the length of the contract. An NHL rookie contract is called an Entry Level contract and is typically limited to three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collective Bargaining Agreement FAQs|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26366|website=NHL.com|accessdate=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soccer===
In [[Major League Soccer]], a rookie is a player who has had no prior professional experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finalists revealed for 2017 MLS year-end awards|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/10/31/finalists-revealed-2017-mls-year-end-awards|website=mlssoccer.com|accessdate=January 20, 2018|date=October 31, 2017|quote=For this award, “rookie” is defined as a player without previous professional experience who made his MLS debut in 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahoney|first1=Ridge|title=MLS Awards: Gressel holds sway in Rookie of the Year race|url=https://www.socceramerica.com/publications/article/75352/mls-awards-gressel-holds-sway-in-rookie-of-the-ye.html|website=socceramerica.com|accessdate=January 20, 2018|date=October 18, 2017|quote=Many of the top young players new to the league, such as Jefferson Savarino of Real Salt Lake, are not eligible due to professional experience prior to their arrival in MLS.}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLS awards the best rookie with the [[MLS Rookie of the Year Award]].

==Etymology==
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] states that the origins are uncertain, but that perhaps it is a corruption of the word ''Recruit''. The earliest example in the OED is from [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''Barrack-Room Ballads'' (published 1892): ''So 'ark an' 'eed, you rookies, which is always grumblin' sore'', referring to rookies in the sense of raw recruits to the British Army.&lt;ref&gt;John Simpson and Edmund Weiner (editors): ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]], second edition'', Clarendon Press, 1989, {{ISBN|0-19-861186-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At least during the beginning of the 20th century, in the British Army the term "rookie" was typically used in place of "recruit" as exemplified in ''Trenching at Gallipoli'' by John Gallishaw (New York Century Co.: 1916) and in ''The Amateur Army'' by Patrick MacGill (London, Herbert Jenkins: 1915). Perhaps the expression is derived from "rook", whereby a "rookie" would be someone who is cheated or defrauded.

The '''rookie list''' is a means for [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) clubs to maintain additional players outside the 38-man primary or senior list. Rookie listed players are not eligible to play in AFL home-and-away or finals matches unless they are elevated to the senior list, either to replace a retired player or a player with a long-term injury.

==Recruitment==
There are two categories of rookie: Category A and Category B. Category A primarily represents players with a traditional Australian rules football development; Category B rookies are players from non-traditional recruiting backgrounds. Category A rookies are usually placed on the list via the [[AFL Draft#Rookie draft|rookie draft]], which occurs annually during the off-season, immediately after the [[AFL Pre-season Draft|pre-season draft]]. As is the case with the AFL's other drafts, clubs are given the opportunity to select rookies in reverse ladder order, based on the previous season's results.

Several types of Category A rookies may be recruited directly by the clubs, without the need to put up for draft (although all such players are recorded against a late draft pick as a formality). This includes:
* International rookies
* Father-son selections – which are permitted only if the player has nominated for and not been selected in a National Draft

===Category B rookies===
Each club is permitted to recruit up to three "Category B" rookies. Category B rookies are recruited directly rather than drafted, and represent players from non-traditional recruiting backgrounds. Players who may be recruited as Category B rookies include:&lt;ref name="details" /&gt;
*International players, who are neither Australian citizens nor residents
*Players from the New South Wales scholarship program
*Players from the International scholarship program
*Zone selections by {{AFL Syd}} and {{AFL GWS}} from New South Wales or the ACT
*Zone selections by {{AFL BL}} and {{AFL GC}} from Queensland
*Players from other sports, who have not been registered with an Australian rules football club for three years
*Indigenous and multicultural players through their Next Generation Academy zones

In the specific case of Irish international rookies, a club may have no more than one Irish Category B rookie at a time; but, the club is permitted to recruit other Irish players as Category A rookies, and may still recruit them directly without putting them up for draft.

==List maintenance==
Each club is allowed to maintain a list of up to six eligible Category A rookies and three Category B rookies. Up to three rookies can be retained, with the player's permission for a second or third season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Murnane, Justin | url=http://www.aflpa.com.au/index.cfm?id=E8FF57A2-D05F-2987-BFC3195520041CA6 | title=2007 Key Draft Dates and Information | publisher=AFL Players Association | date=2007-10-29 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721003459/http://www.aflpa.com.au/index.cfm?id=E8FF57A2-D05F-2987-BFC3195520041CA6 | archivedate=21 July 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the others having to be either delisted or elevated to the primary list at the time of the [[AFL Draft#National Draft|National Draft]]. Only half of the salary paid by a club to players on the rookie list counts towards the league's [[Salary cap#Australian Football League|salary cap]].

Generally speaking, a rookie-listed player cannot be selected to play in the senior AFL competition, and must play in state-level [[Australian Football League reserves affiliations|affiliated teams]], except in two circumstances:
* At the start of a season, a club can nominate up to two veterans from its senior list for salary cap reasons; if a team does not have a full quota of veterans, it can make up the balance by nominating rookies to be eligible for senior selection. These players are known as nominated rookies.
* If a senior-listed player is moved onto the long-term injury list, a rookie-listed player can be temporarily elevated in his place, becoming eligible for senior selection, while the senior player remains injured.
There are usually plenty of opportunities to enact one of these rules, so rookie-listed players who are playing well enough for senior selection are seldom deprived of the opportunity by list management constraints.

==History==
The rookie list was established in 1997. It was initially aimed at providing recruitment opportunities for young players, in part filling a gap which had been left by the reduction in size of AFL lists from 52 to 42 players in 1994. At that time, rookie players must have been between the ages of 18 and 23 to qualify.&lt;ref name="details"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/afl-hq/the-afl-explained/rookie-players|title=Rookie players|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, this was relaxed to allow each club to recruit a rookie older than 23 if he had never previously been on an AFL list. This has since been relaxed further, and now there no upper age or experience restrictions on Category A rookies.

In 2006, "International rookies" were identified for the first time as a separate class of rookie, covering international players from any countries except Ireland, in order to protect the AFL's relationship with the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Quayle |first=Emma |url=http://newsstore.theage.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=AGE060825D07L16MT7PN |title=Clubs to get new overseas talent scheme |publisher=The Age |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2007-05-11 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "International rookie" category has since been expanded to the broader Category B.

The relaxing of eligibility criteria have resulted a notable semantic anomaly with the rookie list: that highly experienced players may serve on a club's rookie list, even though the word "[[rookie]]" is widely understood in most sports and professions to refer to a new or inexperienced person. For example, {{AFL Car}}'s [[Heath Scotland]] spent his sixteenth and final AFL season on Carlton's rookie list, mostly to free up space on the club's primary list.&lt;ref name="rookiedraft"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/carltonwood-blues-pick-another-exmagpie-in-rookie-draft-20131127-2y8ob.html|title=Carltonwood: Blues pick another ex-Magpie in rookie draft|date=27 November 2013|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before eligibility criteria were relaxed, special dispensation was granted for [[Adam Ramanauskas]] to be played on [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]'s rookie list in 2006. Ramanauskas had played over 100 AFL games for the club, but there was uncertainty over his playing future as he underwent treatment and recovery for cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rielly |first=Stephen |url=http://newsstore.theage.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=AGE0611228ON984GPC8E |title='Rama' rookie-listing gets nod |publisher=The Age |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2007-05-11 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
The [[AFL Players' Association|Australian Football League Players' Association]] (AFLPA) has stated a desire to abolish the rookie list, in favour of an expanded 46 player roster. The AFLPA's main argument is that rookies now have the same workload as senior players &amp;ndash; which was not necessarily true in the early days of the rookie list &amp;ndash; but that their pay and opportunities are much lower than that of senior players.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, M., [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/aflpa-push-to-axe-rookie-list/story-e6frf9jf-1226018000524 Herald Sun], "AFLPA push to axe rookie list", 9 March 2011, Retrieved 27 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Run Fatboy Run''''' is a 2007 British-American [[comedy film]] directed by [[David Schwimmer]], written by [[Michael Ian Black]] and [[Simon Pegg]], and starring Pegg, [[Dylan Moran]], [[Thandie Newton]], [[Harish Patel]], [[India de Beaufort]], and [[Hank Azaria]]. It was released in the United Kingdom on 7 September 2007, in [[Canada]] on 10 September 2007, and in the United States on 28 March 2008.

==Plot==
Dennis Doyle ([[Simon Pegg]]) is about to marry Libby ([[Thandie Newton]]), his [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] [[Engagement|fiancée]]. However, he gets cold feet and runs away on the day of the wedding. Five years later, Dennis discovers that Libby, who has their son, Jake, has started seeing successful but arrogant Whit ([[Hank Azaria]]) and realizes that he has truly lost her. He finds out that Whit is running the Nike River Marathon in [[London]], and to prove himself to his uncertain friends and, most importantly, Libby and his son, he decides to run the race himself.

He receives motivation from his two "coaches", Gordon ([[Dylan Moran]]), a well-meaning [[slacker]] who is Libby's cousin and Dennis' best friend, who has made a hefty bet on Dennis succeeding, and Mr. Ghosh Dastidar ([[Harish Patel]]) his landlord, who uses unorthodox methods of training, such as using a spatula to spank him. Days before the race, Whit proposes to Libby at her birthday party. Libby accepts and this puts Dennis in a state of deep [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. As a result, he decides to quit the race.

Meanwhile, Jake, who has formed a crush on a girl in his class, runs away upset when he discovers that she prefers another boy just because he has a ponytail. Dennis, upon being informed by a frantic Libby, tracks him down and explains to him that he will find many things he does not like in his life and he should just stand up to them and face them, rather than running away. Having made that mistake himself, he decides to race after all.

Dennis starts the race alongside Whit, who informs Dennis that he intends to move Libby and Jake to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. Enraged, Dennis mocks Whit and they altercate for a while at the start of the race and, in their efforts to out-do each other, they catch up to and then overtake the professional runners, and suddenly Whit trips Dennis and severely injures him. Stretchers prepare to take Dennis to the hospital.

Whit continues, but is taken to the hospital after feeling pain in his leg. Libby goes to the hospital to look for Dennis, but finds Whit, who claims loudly that his injuries are the result of Dennis deliberately tripping him. The doctor tells him he is not actually injured and has only "[[Hitting the wall|hit the wall]]".  Jake is playing with Whit's hospital bed, and to Libby's disgust, Whit calls him a "little shit".

Dennis has in fact refused to be transported to the hospital or even get medical attention and is continuing the race well into the afternoon and evening with a sprained ankle, accompanied by a growing group of supporters, including Gordon and Mr. Ghosh Dastidar. A panting Dennis almost "hits the wall" but after an emotional [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], his goal to complete the race is restored. Later at Whit's house, Libby, Jake and Whit, watch a television replay of the Whit/Dennis altercation, as the replay shows that in fact Whit had deliberately tripped Dennis and had fallen over because Dennis pulled him down as he was falling.

As Whit tries to justify his behaviour, he blurts out his intentions to have Libby and Jake move to Chicago with him. A fed up Libby puts the engagement ring on a table, telling Whit "nobody's perfect" and storms out with Jake. The two go to meet Dennis as he arrives at the finish line. Dennis falls over just metres from the finish line and cannot get up until he sees Libby and Jake calling to him at which point he gets up, sprints to the finish and collapses in their arms.

Some time later, notably healthier and fully recovered from his injuries, Dennis calls at Libby's house to pick up Jake. He says that he has something to ask her, but is interrupted by Jake, and says he'll talk to her later. However, just after she shuts the door, he knocks again and asks her on a date. She accepts.

In the film's postscript, Gordon &amp;mdash; on the bridge of a new yacht &amp;mdash; tells the tale of the race to two attractive bikini-clad women, whom he invites aboard for a drink. The camera then pans to reveal to the audience that he's as usual, naked below the waist.

Some team sports put players on different official lists according to circumstances for that player, for example if they are injured. There can be different rules for players on different lists, and the details vary between sports.

==NFL==
*[[Active list]]
*[[Inactive list]]
*[[Injured reserve|Injured reserve list]]
*[[Military|Reserve-military list]]
*[[Physically Unable to Perform|Physically Unable to Perform list]]
*[[Reserve-retired]]
*[[Reserve/Suspended]]

==MLB==
*[[Active list]] - Also called the active roster, the 25-man is composed of 25 players who are playing for their Major League team. They are the starting eight position players, pitchers, and reserve players on the team. Players on the active roster are also on the 40-man roster. These players are generally the only ones who dress in uniform and are the only ones who may take the field in a game at any time. Typically, only players on the 25-man roster, and players who are on the disabled list but were on the 25-man roster, travel on road trips with the Major League team.
*Reserved list - Defined in Major League Rule 2, the 40-man roster is also known as the Major League Reserve List. This name hearkens back to baseball's past when teams reserved the rights to a number of their players, making it impossible for any other team to sign those individuals. In time, a team's reserve list was expanded to all players under contract to that team until the player was released (potentially never). In the 1970s, free agency allowed players achieving certain conditions the opportunity to leave their original team. The system has undergone further changes since then, but there are still players under reserve from year to year on each team. Those players include most minor leaguers and players on the Major League Reserve List.
*[[Grief|Bereavement list]] - Major League players may be placed on the bereavement list due to severe illness or death of that player’s or his spouse’s immediate family. Minimum period is 3 days, maximum 7 days. Players on this list are counted towards the Reserve List Limit but not the Active List Limit.
*[[Designated List]] - When the Active or Reserve List Limit has been reached for a particular club, and the club desires to add an additional player, one player from that club must be designated, meaning giving notice to the Commissioner to release or assign that player within 10 days. Such players do not count towards the player limits, but cannot participate until release or assigned.
*[[Disabled list]] - 10-Day: The player must remain off the active roster for a minimum of 10 calendar days, starting on the day following the player’s last game. 60-Day: Same rules apply, however, this may only be used when the team’s 40-man roster is full. Any player placed on the 60-day disabled list after August 1 may not play for the remainder of the season, including any post-season game.
*[[Emergency Disabled list]] - Maximum number of players on list at one time-no limit. Minimum period of inactivity-sixty (60) calendar days. Players placed on this list after August 1 shall remain there for the balance of the season. This list may only be used when a club is at the maximum limit of 40 players.
*[[Disqualified list]] - Players who violate their player contract. Players on this list do not count towards the Reserved List or Active List limits. A player may remain on this list for two consecutive years before he is removed. A player who is "Disqualified" is deemed "suspended" on the official MLB transaction report.
*[[Ineligible list]] - Players found guilty of serious misconduct (gambling, tanking, bribery, violence to umpires). Players on this list do not count towards the Reserved List or Active List limits. A player may remain on this list for two consecutive years before he is removed.
*[[Military|Military list]] - Players with definite orders to report for military service. Players on this list do not count towards the Reserved List or Active List limits. Upon learning that a player has separated from military service, a team must immediately notify the Commissioner.
*[[Restricted list]] - Players who fail to report within 10 days of the season, or who fail to come to a contract with the team prior to that time. Players on this list do not count towards the Reserved List or Active List limits. A player may remain on this list for two consecutive years before he is removed. Often, placing a player on the Restricted List is akin to releasing him without fully relinquishing his rights.
*[[Suspension (punishment)|Suspended list]] - Player may be suspended by his club or the league for insubordination, misconduct, or failure to report in playing condition. A player on this lists counts both towards the Reserve List and the Active List limits.
*[[Temporarily inactive list]] - Players not able to render active service due to: (1) necessary temporary absence due to family member’s illness; (2) absence excused for personal obligations; or (3) awaiting release for the purpose of allowing the player to sign with a foreign league. Minimum placement is 3 days. Players on the TIA count towards the Reserve List limit but not the Active List limit.
*[[Voluntarily retired list]] - Player under contract who retires is placed on the Voluntarily Retired List. If a player desires to return, he may not be reinstated until 60 days after the season in which he retired. He may also not play baseball elsewhere without obtaining consent from the club owning his rights. Players on this list do not count towards the Reserved List or Active List limits. A player may remain on this list for two consecutive years before he is removed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13034">In [[professional wrestling]], a '''ten-bell salute''' is given to honor a wrestler who has died, especially when the wrestler is a current member of the [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] or a distinguished former member of the promotion. It is the professional wrestling equivalent of a [[three-volley salute]]. It is typically given at the beginning of a [[card (professional wrestling)|card]], with the current members of the promotion either in the entryway, in the ring, or around the ring. Both the wrestlers and audience observe a [[moment of silence]] while the bell is rung.

== Honorees ==
=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE ===
[[WWE]] (formerly known as the World Wrestling Federation and the World Wrestling Entertainment) has included several ten-bell salutes in its television broadcasts. Some of the honorees include:

==== Ten-bell salutes within WWF/WWE storylines ====
While ten-bell salutes have typically been reserved for real-life deaths, it has been used in [[kayfabe]] at least thrice in WWE history (see [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|worked shoot]]). The most recent instance was in June 2007 for [[Vince McMahon#Mr. McMahon|Mr. McMahon]] (WWE chairman Vince McMahon's on-screen persona), as part of an angle where he was inside a limousine that exploded, and was presumed dead.

In 1988, [[Harley Race]] was "honored" with ten bells as part of a [[Promo (professional wrestling)|promo]] by [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby "The Brain" Heenan]], wherein Heenan accused Hulk Hogan of causing serious injuries to Race. This angle grew out of a match where Race was legitimately injured during a match against Hogan, due to a mistimed move, and was forced to take a hiatus.

On a ''Raw Is War'' broadcast shortly after the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]] in January 1998, [[Paul Bearer]] and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] rang the bell ten times in ring to mock [[The Undertaker]], with whom they were feuding at the time. Their actions grew from an incident at the Royal Rumble where, in the storyline, Kane and Bearer had locked The Undertaker in a casket and set it ablaze, presumably killing Undertaker. However, that failed when Undertaker returned and accepted Kane's challenge for a fight, setting up the stage for WrestleMania XIV.

In 1999, a ten-bell salute was given to [[Big Show]]'s father, who was said to have died of cancer as part of a storyline. In reality, he had died of stomach cancer in 1992.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ===
Arguably the best-known ten-bell salute in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] is that given to [[Chris Candido]] at [[TNA Hard Justice#2005|Hard Justice]] in May 2005. Candido had died of a [[Thrombosis|blood clot]] due to complications of leg surgery on April 28 of that year.

There was also a ten-bell salute at a TNA event in Amsterdam, New York on May 20, 2011, in honor of "Macho Man" [[Randy Savage]], who had died that morning.&lt;ref&gt;"‘Macho Man’ tribute part of TNA event," ''The Daily Gazette'', http://www.dailygazette.com/news/2011/may/21/0521_tna/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Usage in other promotions ===
In [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] at the [[ECW CyberSlam#1998|Cyber Slam]] event, a ten-bell salute was given in remembrance of [[Louie Spicolli]], who died from an accidental drug overdose on February 15, 1998.

[[Lucha Underground]] gave a ten-bell salute in remembrance of [[Perro Aguayo, Jr.]] on March 21, 2015, the night after Aguayo tragically died in the ring due to a freak accident that happened during a tag team match for The Crash in [[Tijuana]].

[[File:Bjorkman and Woodbridge winners Wimbledon 2004.jpg|thumb|right|2002 – 2004 Wimbledon doubles champion, [[Todd Woodbridge]] from Australia and [[Jonas Björkman]] from Sweden]]
The '''Wimbledon effect''' (Japanese: ウィンブルドン現象, [[rōmaji]]: ''Uinburudon Genshō'', literally "Wimbledon Phenomenon") is a chiefly British and Japanese analogy (which possibly originated in Japan&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/globalisation/story/0,7369,1242513,00.html "Leader: Foreign ownership – Importing success"], 19 June 2004, ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amory, Edward Heathcoat : [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_199806/ai_n8795065 "A fearful symmetry"], 6 June 1998, ''[[The Spectator]]''&lt;/ref&gt;) which compares the tennis fame of the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon Championships]], held at the [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club]] in [[Wimbledon, London]], with the economic success of the United Kingdom's [[financial services]] industries – especially those clustered in the [[City of London]]. 

The point of the analogy is that a national and international institution (the All England Club) can be highly successful despite the lack of strong native competition, as in modern tennis Britain has produced very few Wimbledon champions, with only [[Ann Haydon Jones]], [[Virginia Wade]] (both women's singles), [[Jonathan Marray]] (men's doubles), [[Andy Murray]] (men's singles), [[John Lloyd (tennis)|John Lloyd]], [[Jeremy Bates (tennis)|Jeremy Bates]], [[Jo Durie]], [[Jamie Murray]] and [[Heather Watson]] (mixed doubles) winning titles in the Open Era.

==Financial context==
London's financial industry has [[economic boom|boomed]] since the [[deregulation]] of British financial markets (the "[[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]]") in the 1980s under the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]] — but has also become dominated by foreign companies, especially American [[investment bank]]s, rather than British firms (a result opposite to the original intention of the reforms).

The analogy is typically used to mark a debate over whether it matters if an industry is primarily domestically owned if easing of foreign ownership restrictions allows the economy to benefit from foreign investment and increased global competition. The phrase can be used positively to assert the economic success of [[economic liberalism|liberal]] attitudes towards foreign ownership (and sometimes to emphasize that such attitudes promote a level playing field for domestic and foreign interests alike); or it can be used negatively to emphasize how these policies have eroded a nation's ability to produce globally leading domestic companies. This opposing perspective is represented by [[economic nationalism|economic patriotism and "national champion" policies]].
[[File:Asashoryu and Hakuho glare at each other 2008 May.jpg|thumb|left|190px|The 68th [[yokozuna]] [[Asashōryū Akinori|Asasyoryu]] and the 69th yokozuna [[Hakuho]], who are both from Mongolia]]
The analogy has also been used in policy discourses outside Britain – most notably in the business discourse of Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Sprague, Jonathan : [https://web.archive.org/web/20051204190211/http://pathfinder.com/asiaweek/magazine/2000/0922/biz.takeovers.html "Foreigners at the Wheel : A new boss at scandal-hit Mitsubishi Motors"], 22 September 2000, ''[[Asiaweek|Asiaweek.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.analyticajapan.com/glossmain.html#w "DATABASE: GLOSSARY OF JAPANESE TERMS"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006092339/http://www.analyticajapan.com/glossmain.html#w#w |date=6 October 2010 }}, ''ANALYTICA JAPAN: FINANCIAL RESEARCH''&lt;/ref&gt; whose financial markets and other parts of the economy (as of 2006) have not yet been substantially opened up to foreign competition compared with its international peers. It has also, for instance, been used in banking reform debates in [[Republic of Korea|South Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/biz/200611/kt2006112119004911880.htm |title=::: The Korea Times ::: |publisher=Times.hankooki.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in discussing [[business process outsourcing]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/createpdf.cfm?articleid=875{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports in Japan==
The term has also frequently been appearing in sports in Japan since late 20th century, including [[sumo]] where [[Kisenosato Yutaka|there has been only one Japanese-born yokozuna since 1998]] as most of the top players have been from Mongolia or [[Polynesia]]. Similarly in [[combat sports]] (''kakutougi''), [[K-1]] was the biggest [[kickboxing]] promotion of the world, whereas [[Pride Fighting Championships]] was the biggest [[mixed martial arts]] promotion of the world. Nevertheless, both K-1 and Pride had few Japanese-born popular players or champions. The vast majority of prominent competitors in K-1 came from the Netherlands or Thailand, while Pride's biggest names were from Brazil, United States, and Russia.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
