'''Apache Kylin''' is an [[Open-source software|open source]] distributed analytics engine designed to provide a [[SQL]] interface and [[OLAP|multi-dimensional analysis (OLAP)]] on [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]] supporting extremely large datasets.

It was originally developed by [[eBay]], and is now a project of the [[Apache Software Foundation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Apache Software Foundation.  [https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the_apache_software_foundation_announces85 "The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache™ Kylin™ as a Top-Level Project"], 8 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Kylin project was started in 2013, in eBay's R&amp;D in Shanghai, China. In Oct 2014, Kylin v0.6 was open sourced on github.com with the name "KylinOLAP"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/announcing-kylin-extreme-olap-engine-for-big-data/|title=Announcing Kylin: Extreme OLAP Engine for Big Data|date=2014-10-20|website=www.ebayinc.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

In Nov 2014, Kylin joined Apache Software Foundation incubator.  

In December 2015, Apache Kylin graduated to be a Top Level Project &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

==Architecture==
Apache Kylin is built on top of Apache Hadoop, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Calcite, Apache Spark and other technologies. As these technologies are very powerful and matured, making Kylin can support massive data load, and easy to scale. 

Kylin has the following core components:

* REST Server: Receive and response user or APIrequrests
* Metadata: Persistent and manage system, especially the cube metadata;
* Query Engine: Parse SQL queries to execution plan, and then talk with storage engine;
* Storage Engine: Pushdown and scan underlying cube storage (default in HBase);
* Job Engine: Generate and execute MapReduce or Spark job to build source data into cube;

== Users ==
Apache Kylin has been adopted by many companies as their OLAP platform in production. Typical users includes eBay, Meituan, XiaoMi, NetEase, Beike, Yahoo! Japan.

== Roadmap ==
Apache Kylin roadmap (from Kylin website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kylin.apache.org/development/|title=Apache Kylin {{!}} Development Quick Guide|last=Kylin|first=Apache|website=kylin.apache.org|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;):

* Hadoop 3.0 support (Erasure Coding)
* Fully on Spark Cube engine
* Connect more data sources (MySQL, Oracle, SparkSQL, etc)
* Ad-hoc queries without Cubing
* Better storage (Druid, Kudu, etc)
* Real-time analytics with Lambda Architecture

'''''Atheïstisch manifest: drie wijsgerige opstellen over godsdienst en moraal''''' ("Atheist Manifesto: Three Philosophical Essays on Religion and Morality") is an [[essay]] bundle by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[philosopher]] [[Herman Philipse]]. Originally published in 1995, Philipse brought out a new version in 2004, that included a new bundle of four essays titled ''De onredelijkheid van religie'' ("The Unreasonableness of Religion"). The compilation was published under the name '''''Atheïstisch manifest en De onredelijkheid van religie''''' ("Atheist Manifesto and The Unreasonableness of Religion").

In the short book, Philipse opines that one can speak rationally about the existence of [[God]], but if one wishes to take the [[natural sciences]] seriously, one needs to reject the traditional meaning of the word 'God'. However, if one wished to define the word 'God' as something unknowable, God cannot have any descriptive contents and therefore not exist. Thus there is no grounding for [[theism|theistic]] [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2550185/1995/10/16/BOEK.dhtml |title=BOEK &amp; |author=Jaap de Berg |work=[[Trouw]] |date=16 October 1995 |accessdate=29 January 2014 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2566034/1995/12/14/Geloof-doet-het-verstand-geweld-aan.dhtml |title='Geloof doet het verstand geweld aan' |author= |work=Trouw |date=14 December 1995 |accessdate=29 January 2014 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philipse's ''Atheïstisch manifest'' got him into a fierce argument with several theologians, including Eginhard Meijering, [[Vincent Brümmer]] and [[Harry Kuitert]], who replied to him disapprovingly, and eventually faced him in a debate on "the tenability of atheism" in the spring of 1996. Philipse claimed that all arguments thus far proposed for the [[existence of God]] were invalid, while the theologians argued Philipse had insufficiently delved into the matter, missed the religious context, and ignored how much [[consolation]] belief in God offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2718341/1996/04/05/In-universitaire-oorlog-tussen-ongelovigen-en-theologen-mag-nu-alles.dhtml |title=In universitaire oorlog tussen ongelovigen en theologen mag nu alles |author= |publisher=Trouw |date=5 April 1996 |accessdate=29 January 2014 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] read ''Atheïstisch manifest'' in 2002, which led her to her definitive [[apostasy]], after which she famously became a critic of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/Nieuws/archief/article/detail/1779939/2003/01/29/Dwars-op-haar-eigen-Verlichtingspad.dhtml |title=Dwars op haar eigen Verlichtingspad |author=Lodewijk Dros |work=Trouw |date=29 January 2003 |accessdate=29 January 2014 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.asiantribune.com/node/175 |work=Asian Tribune |date=20 May 2006 |first=Sohail |last=Choudhury |accessdate=29 January 2014 |title=Controversial Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Muslim turned atheist, to resign from Dutch Parliament |publisher=World Institute For Asian Studies| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707174839/http://www.asiantribune.com/node/175| archivedate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Philipse, too, the topic of religion and morality once again gained urgency because of "9/11", whereupon he decided to write four new essays on the [[relationship between religion and science]] under the title of ''De onredelijkheid van religie'', and combine it with his 1995 work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.polare.nl/boek/philipse-herman/atheistisch-manifest-de-onredelijkheid-van-religie-9789035126541/ |title=Atheistisch manifest &amp; De onredelijkheid van religie |author= |publisher=[[Polare]] |date= |accessdate=31 January 2014 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire composition, complete with a preface written by Hirsi Ali, was published in 2004 under the name ''Atheïstisch manifest en De onredelijkheid van religie''.

In 2012, Philipse published a new and much more elaborate book, ''[[God in the Age of Science?]]'', as an improvement on ''Atheïstisch manifest''. He commented on the issue: "It was a matter of conscience. Everyone in the Netherlands knows me only because of that odd manifesto. Well, that frustrates one. I wanted to research the question really well for once. So that they can no longer say: you have merely written a superficial booklet about it."&lt;ref&gt;Original in Dutch: "Het was een gewetenskwestie. Iedereen in Nederland kent mij van dat rare manifest. Nou, daar baal je ook van. Ik wilde de zaak een keer echt goed onderzoeken. Dan kunnen ze niet meer zeggen: jij hebt er alleen maar zo'n oppervlakkig boekje over geschreven." {{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5116/Filosofie/article/detail/3252309/2012/05/08/Het-hoofdstuk-God-is-nu-wel-gesloten.dhtml |title='Het hoofdstuk God is nu wel gesloten' |author=Wilfred van de Poll |publisher=Trouw |date=8 May 2012 |accessdate=29 January 2014 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2319">The '''Barwise prize''' was established in 2002 by the [[American Philosophical Association]], in conjunction with the APA Committee on Philosophy and Computers, on the basis of a proposal from the [[International Association for Computing and Philosophy]] for significant and sustained contributions to areas relevant to [[philosophy]] and [[computing]]. 

The Prize is awarded annually, by the APA Committee on Philosophy and Computers. It serves to credit philosophers for their lifelong efforts in this field. It also serves to acknowledge and to encourage work in all areas relevant to the computational and informational turn in philosophy.

Examples of areas that are of interest to the Committee in selecting candidates for this Prize include: the use of computers in the teaching of philosophy; the philosophical aspects of [[artificial intelligence]]; and the area of [[computer ethics]].

The Committee selected the name of [[Jon Barwise]] for this Prize because his life's work exemplified a concern with research and teaching, while his efforts were often embodied in the production of courseware and changes of curriculum.

The '''[[Jay Dickey|Dickey]]-[[Roger Wicker|Wicker]] Amendment''' is the name of an appropriation bill [[Rider (legislation)|rider]] attached to a bill passed by [[United States Congress]] in 1995, and signed by former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]], which prohibits the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) from using appropriated funds for the creation of human embryos for research purposes or for research in which human embryos are destroyed.  HHS funding includes the funding for the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH).  Technically the Dickey Amendment is a "rider" to other legislation, which amends the original legislation.  The rider receives its name from the name of the Congressman that originally introduced the amendment, Representative [[Jay Dickey]].  The Dickey amendment language has been added to each of the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations acts for FY1997 through FY2009.  The original rider can be found in Section 128 of P.L. 104-99
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = P.L. 104-99 | work = Thomas H.R.2880 | publisher =  The Library of Congress | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:HR02880:   | accessdate = 2009-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wording of the rider is generally the same year after year.  For FY2009, the wording in Division F, Section 509 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Public Law No. 111-8 | work = Thomas H.R.1105 | publisher =  The Library of Congress | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.1105.enr:  | accessdate = 2009-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (enacted March 11, 2009) prohibits HHS, including NIH, from using FY2009 appropriated funds as follows:

:SEC. 509. (a) None of the funds made available in this Act may be used for--

::(1) the creation of a human embryo or embryos for research purposes; or
::(2) research in which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed, discarded, or knowingly subjected to risk of injury or death greater than that allowed for research on fetuses in utero under 45 CFR 46.208(a)(2) and Section 498(b) of the [[Public Health Service Act]] [http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/phsvcact/phsvcact.htm](42 U.S.C. 289g(b)) (Title 42, Section 289g(b), [[United States Code]]).

:(b) For purposes of this section, the term "human embryo or embryos" includes any organism, not protected as a human subject under 45 CFR 46 (the Human Subject Protection regulations) . . . that is derived by [[fertilization]], [[parthenogenesis]], [[cloning]], or any other means from one or more human [[gametes]] ([[spermatozoon|sperm]] or [[ovum|egg]]) or human [[diploid]] cells (cells that have two sets of [[chromosome]]s, such as [[somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells).

In March 2009, President Obama issued an executive order which removed the restriction against federal funding of stem cell research. However, the Dickey–Wicker Amendment remains an obstacle for federally funded researchers seeking to create their own stem cell lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama's Stem Cell Policy Hasn't Reversed Legislative Restrictions |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=2009-03-14 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/03/14/obamas-approval-stem-cell-research-needs-congressional-action/ |accessdate=2009-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318065009/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/03/14/obamas-approval-stem-cell-research-needs-congressional-action/ |archivedate=March 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Stolberg | first = Sheryl | title = Obama Is Leaving Some Stem Cell Issues to Congress  | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2009-03-08  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/09/us/politics/09stem.html?_r=2 | accessdate = 2009-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, as part of preliminary motions in ''[[Sherley vs Sebelius]]'', Judge [[Royce C. Lamberth]] granted an injunction against federally funded embryonic stem cell (ESC) research on the grounds that the guidelines for ESC research "clearly violate" the Dickey–Wicker Amendment. In September 2010, he refused to lift the injunction pending the conclusion of the case and the issuance of his ruling and a likely appeal. In response, the Obama Justice Department asked the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] to lift the injunction via an order pending the appeal of Judge Lamberth's ruling,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| journal = Nature| url = http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100824/full/news.2010.428.html| date = 24 August 2010| title = US court suspends research on human embryonic stem cells | doi = 10.1038/news.2010.428 | last1 = Katsnelson | first1 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which it did on April 29, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/04/appeals-court-lifts-stem-cell-funding-injunction.ars | date=April 29, 2011 | author=John Timmer | publisher=arsTechnica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Lamberth was thereby obliged to reverse his ruling, and grudgingly dismissed the case entirely on July 27, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/07/stem-court-ruling-a-decisive-victory.html |title=Stem Court Ruling a Decisive Victory for NIH |journal=Science Insider |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |date=July 27, 2011 |last=Kaiser |first=Jocelyn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814121745/http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/07/stem-court-ruling-a-decisive-victory.html |archivedate=2011-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2-1 opinion of April 29, 2011, the appeals panel said that the Dickey–Wicker Amendment was "ambiguous" and that the National Institutes of Health had "reasonably concluded" that although federal funds could not be used to directly destroy an embryo, the amendment does not prohibit funding a research project using embryonic stem cells.  This is an important distinction under the law, because for federal funds to be used directly to support the destruction of embryos- as opposed to indirect use just in embryo stem cell research that avoids killing the embryo- is supposedly a violation of the [[Hyde Amendment]], which has been ruled constitutional and which prohibits abortions using federal tax dollar funds (those questions will now have to be settled by the whole Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sitting en banc, or perhaps, ultimately, by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]).

==History of US concerns about embryos==
Federal concern with [[human embryo]] research began over 25 years ago with the advent of [[assisted reproduction technologies]], i.e. [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) or "[[test tube babies]]."&lt;ref name="bedfordresearch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bedfordresearch.org/article/dickey-wicker-amendment-human-embryo-research-25912|title=The History of the Dickey-Wicker Amendment|work=Bedford Stem Cell Research Foundation|date=August 24, 2010|last=Kiessling|first=Ann A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the first report of laboratory studies of human fertilization appeared in Science in 1944, (the work was conducted in Brookline, Massachusetts), clinical IVF was successful first in [[Great Britain]] in 1978 for couples with infertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/25/newsid_2499000/2499411.stm|title=On This Day|work=BBC Web|date=July 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; IVF became standard of care in the United States in the early 1980s. As with all forms of clinical treatment, the medical community looked to basic science research to improve the safety and efficacy of IVF for mothers and babies.&lt;ref name="bedfordresearch" /&gt;

In 1979, an Ethics Advisory Board for the [[National Institutes of Health]] issued guidelines for research on early human embryos, but no action was taken. The Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (see: [[Human subject research legislation in the United States]]) enacted in 1977 remained in place: 45CFR § 46.204(d), "No application or proposal involving human in vitro fertilization may be funded by the Department or any component thereof until the application or proposal has been reviewed by the Ethical Advisory Board and the Board has rendered advice as to its acceptability from an ethical standpoint."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/books/lbb/x375.htm|title=LSU LAW CENTER: Ethics Advisory Boards|work=LSU Law Center's Medical and Public Health Law Site|year=1993|first=Edward P.|last=((Richards, III, JD, MPH))}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since there was no Ethics Advisory Board, federally funded research was not possible.&lt;ref name="bedfordresearch" /&gt;

'''Dispersed knowledge''' in [[economics]] is the notion that no single [[Agent (economics)|agent]] has information as to all of the factors which influence [[prices]] and [[Production (economics)|production]] throughout the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=1809376|title = The use of knowledge in society|last = Hayek|first = Friedrich|date = 1 September 1945|journal = The American Economic Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |publisher = American Economic Association|volume = 35|issue=4|pages = 519–530|issn = 0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Each agent in a market for assets, goods, or services possesses incomplete knowledge as to most of the factors which affect prices in that market. For example, no agent has full information as to other agents' budgets, preferences, resources or technologies, not to mention their plans for the future and numerous other factors which affect prices in those markets.&lt;ref name=hayek1973&gt;
{{cite book |last=Hayek|first=Friedrich |title=Law, Legislation and Liberty |year=1973 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-32086-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=w6siEMiphFwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=law+legislation+and+liberty |pages=11–16, 42, 51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market prices are the result of [[price discovery]], in which each agent participating in the market makes use of its current knowledge and plans to decide on the prices and quantities at which it chooses to transact. The resulting prices and quantities of transactions may be said to reflect the current state of knowledge of the agents currently in the market, even though no single agent commands information as to the entire set of such knowledge.&lt;ref name="Menger"&gt;{{cite book|last = Menger|first = Carl|title = Problems of Economics and Sociology|year = 1963|publisher = University of Illinois Press|last2 = Louis|first2 = Schneider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists believe that market transactions provide the basis for a society to benefit from the knowledge that is dispersed among its constituent agents. For example, in his ''Principles of Political Economy'', [[John Stuart Mill]] states that one of the justifications for a [[laissez faire]] government policy is his belief that self-interested individuals throughout the economy, acting independently, can make better use of dispersed knowledge than could the best possible government agency.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;{{cite book|last = Mill|first = John Stuart|title = Principles of Political Economy|year = 1909|url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30107/30107-h/30107-h.html|date = |publisher = Longmans, Green and Co|publication-place = London|publication-date = |edition = 7th|editor-last = Ashley|editor-first = William James}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dispersed knowledge.png|thumb]]

== Key characteristics ==
[[Friedrich Hayek]] claimed that "dispersed knowledge is ''essentially'' dispersed, and cannot possibly be gathered together and conveyed to an authority charged with the task of deliberately creating order".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The fatal conceit: The errors of socialism|last = Hayek|first = Friedrich|publisher = Routledge|year = 1988|isbn = 0415008204|location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phenomena ==
* "Dispersed knowledge will give rise to genuine uncertainty, which necessitates the contractual structure that we recognize as a firm."
* "Dispersion of knowledge and genuine uncertainty contribute to the heterogeneity of expectations that must exist in order for one or more individuals to exploit the potential of the contractual structure of the firm."
* "Dispersion of knowledge, genuine uncertainty, and heterogeneous expectations give rise to the nexus of the enterprising individual and the opportunity to discover, create, and exploit new markets."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dispersed knowledge and an entrepreneurial theory of the firm|last = Dew|first = Nicholas|date = 2004|journal = Journal of Business Venturing|doi = 10.1016/j.jbusvent.2003.09.004|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Velamuri|first2 = S. Ramakrishna|last3 = Venkataraman|first3 = Sankaran|volume = 19|issue=5|pages = 659–679|issn = 0883-9026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drivers ==
# Large numbers: Large numbers have a great impact on actions in terms of two aspects. On the one hand, there will be an increase in time and other resource requirements. On the other hand, actors with bounded cognitive resources will lose overview.
# Asymmetries: Asymmetries have a two-sides effect. Firstly, asymmetries enable more possibilities regarding learning and competence development. Secondly, asymmetries "increase differences between interpretative frameworks and the knowledge and competence profile of the different actors and thus make integration more difficult". 
# Uncertainty: Uncertainty is defined to be one of the drivers of dispersed knowledge which can give rise to management problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Managing Dispersed Knowledge: Organizational Problems, Managerial Strategies, and Their Effectiveness|last = Becker|first = Markus C|date = 2001|journal = Journal of Management Studies|doi = 10.1111/1467-6486.00271|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 38|issue=7|pages = 1037|issn = 0022-2380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uncertainty ==
Dispersed knowledge will give rise to uncertainty which will lead to different kinds of results.
* 1. Dispersed knowledge causes different opinions and sources in cooperate organizations and it brings creativity.
Richard LeFauve highlights the advantages of organizational structure in companies:

''"Before if we had a tough decision to make, we would have two or three different perspectives  with strong support of all three. In a traditional organization the bossman decides after he’s heard all three alternatives. At Saturn we take time to work it out, and what generally happens is that you end up with a fourth answer which none of the portions had in the first place. but one that all three portions of the organization fully support (AutoWeeR, Oct. 8, 1990. p. 20)."''

Companies are supposed to think highly of the dispersed knowledge and make adjustments to meet demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6435.1993.tb00499.x/abstract|title = The Problem with Dispersed Knowledge: Firms in Theory and Practice|last = Minkler|first = Alanson P|date = 1993|journal = Kyklos|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6435.1993.tb00499.x|pmid = |access-date = |issn = 0023-5962|volume = 46 |issue = 4|pages = 569–587}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2. Dispersed knowledge causes management problems as the same time.
Tsoukas stated:

''"A firm’s knowledge is distributed, not only in a computational sense . . . or in Hayek’s (1945, p. 521) sense that the factual knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place cannot be surveyed as a whole. But, more radically, a firm’s knowledge is distributed in the sense that it is inherently indeterminate: nobody knows in advance what that knowledge is or need be. Firms are faced with radical uncertainty: they do not, they cannot, know what they need to know."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The firm as a distributed knowledge system: A constructionist approach|last = Tsoukas|first = Haridimos|date = 1996|journal = Strategic Management Journal|doi = 10.1002/smj.4250171104|pmid = |access-date = |pages = 11–25|volume = 17|issn = 0143-2095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies ==
There are several strategies targeting at the problems caused by dispersed knowledge.

First of all, replacing knowledge by getting access to knowledge can be one of the strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=2393553|title = Absorptive Capacity: A New Perspective on Learning and Innovation|last = Cohen|first = Wesley M|date = 1990|journal = Administrative Science Quarterly|doi = 10.2307/2393553|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Levinthal|first2 = Daniel A|issn = 0001-8392|pages = 128–152|volume = 35|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=259373|title = Social capital, intellectual capital, and the organizational advantage|last = Nahapiet|first = Janine|date = 1998|journal = The Academy of Management Review|doi = 10.5465/amr.1998.533225|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Ghoshal|first2 = Sumantra|issn = 0363-7425|pages = 242–266|volume = 23|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What's more, the capability to complete incomplete knowledge can deal with knowledge gaps created by the dispersed knowledge.

In addition, making a design of institutions with reasonable coordination mechanisms can be regarded as the third strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=40397436|title = Managing Cross-Border Complementary Knowledge: Conceptual Developments in the Business Process Approach to Knowledge Management in Multinational Firms|last = Burkley|first = Peter J|date = 1999|journal = International Studies of Management &amp; Organization|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Carter|first2 = Martin J|volume = 29|issue=1|issn = 0020-8825|pages = 80–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides, resolving organization units into smaller ones should be taken into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Games and decisions : introduction and critical survey|last = Luce|first = R Duncan|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1957|isbn = 0486659437|location = New York|pages = |last2 = Howard|first2 = Raiffa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Last but not least, providing more data to decision maker will be helpful for making a correct decision.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5531">'''Mental energy''' or '''psychic energy''' is a concept in some [[psychology|psychological]] theories or models of a postulated unconscious mental functioning on a level between biology and consciousness.

==Philosophical accounts==
The idea harks back to Aristotle's conception of ''[[actus et potentia]]''. "Energy" here used in the literal meaning of "activity" or "operation". [[Henry More]], in his 1642 ''Psychodia platonica; or a platonicall song of the soul'', defined an "energy of the soul" as including "every phantasm of the soul". [[Julian Sorell Huxley]] defines "mental energy" as "the driving forces of the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]], [[emotion]]al as well as [[intellect]]ual" (''On living in a revolution'' xv.192, 1944).

==Psychoanalytic accounts==
In 1874, the concept of "[[psychodynamics]]" was proposed with the publication of ''Lectures on Physiology'' by German physiologist [[Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke]] who, in coordination with physicist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], one of the formulators of the [[first law of thermodynamics]] ([[conservation of energy]]), supposed that all living organisms are energy-systems also governed by this principle. During this year, at the [[University of Vienna]], Brücke served as supervisor for first-year medical student Sigmund Freud who adopted this new "dynamic" physiology. In his ''Lectures on Physiology'', Brücke set forth the then-radical view that the living organism is a [[dynamic system]] to which the laws of [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] apply.&lt;ref name = "Hall" &gt;{{cite book | last = Hall | first = Calvin, S.| title = A Primer in Freudian Psychology | publisher = Meridian Book | year = 1954 | isbn = 0-452-01183-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'', Freud argued that the [[Id,_ego_and_super-ego#Id|id]] was the source of the personality's desires, and therefore of the psychic energy that powered the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hall, Calvin S. |author2=Nordby, Vernon J. | title=A Primer of Jungian Psychology | location=New York | publisher=Meridian | year=1999 | isbn=0-452-01186-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud defined [[libido]] as the instinct energy or force. Freud later added the [[death drive]] (also contained in the id) as a second source of mental energy.  The origins of Freud's basic model, based on the fundamentals of chemistry and physics, according to [[John Bowlby]], stems from [[Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke|Brücke]], [[Meynert]], [[Josef Breuer|Breuer]], [[Helmholtz]], and [[Herbart]].&lt;ref name="Bowlby" &gt;{{cite book | last = Bowlby | first = John | title = Attachment and Loss: Vol I, 2nd Ed. | publisher = Basic Books | pages = 13–23| year = 1999 | isbn = 0-465-00543-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, [[Carl Jung]] published a seminal essay entitled "On Psychic Energy". Later, the theory of psychodynamics and the concept of "psychic energy" was developed further by those such as [[Alfred Adler]] and [[Melanie Klein]].

Just as physical energy acts upon physical objects, psychological energy would act upon psychological entities, i.e. thoughts. Psychological energy and force are the basis of an attempt to formulate a scientific theory according to which psychological phenomena would be subject to precise laws akin to how physical objects are subject to Newton's laws. This concept of psychological energy is completely separate and distinct from (or even opposed to) the mystical eastern concept of [[energy (spiritual)|spiritual energy]].

The [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator#Attitudes: extraversion/introversion|Myers–Briggs Type Indicator
]]  divides people into 16 categories based on whether certain activities leave them feeling energized or drained of energy.

==Neuroscientific accounts==
Mental energy has been repeatedly compared to or connected with the physical quantity [[energy]].

Studies of the 1990s to 2000s (and earlier) have found that mental effort can be measured in terms of increased metabolism in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Benton, D., Parker, P. Y., &amp; Donohoe, R. T. (1996). The supply of glucose to the brain and cognitive functioning. Journal of Biosocial Science, 28, 463–479. Fairclough, S. H., &amp; Houston, K. (2004). A metabolic measure of mental effort. Biological Psychology, 66, 177-190.  Gailliot, M.T., Baumeister, R.F., et al. (in press). Self-control relies on glucose as a limited energy source: Willpower is more than a metaphor. ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern neuroscientific view is that [[brain metabolism]], measured by [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] or [[positron emission tomography]], is a physical [[correlate]] of mental activity.

This article describes the [[syntax]] of [[clause]]s in the [[English language]], that is, the ways of combining and ordering constituents such as [[verb]]s and [[noun phrases]] to form a clause.

==Types of clause==
Clauses can be classified as [[independent clause|''independent'']] (main clauses) and [[dependent clause|''dependent'']] (subordinate clauses). A typical [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] consists of one independent clause, possibly augmented by one or more dependent clauses.

An independent clause is a simple sentence. Sentences can be classified according to the purpose or function of the sentence into [[declarative sentence|''declarative'']] (making a statement), [[interrogative sentence|''interrogative'']] (asking a question), exclamatory sentence or [[imperative sentence|''imperative'']] (giving an order).

In interrogative main clauses, unless the subject is or contains the [[interrogative word]], the verb precedes the subject: ''Are you hungry?'' ''Where am I?'' (but ''Who did this?'', without inversion, since the interrogative ''who'' is itself the subject). However such inversion is only possible with an [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] or [[copula verb|copular]] verb; if no such verb would otherwise be present, [[do-support|''do''-support]] is used.

In most imperative clauses the subject is absent: ''Eat your dinner!'' However imperative clauses may include the subject for emphasis: ''You eat your dinner!''. The form of the verb is the base form of the verb, such as ''eat'', ''write'', ''be''. Modal verbs do not have imperative forms. Negation uses ''do''-support, even if the verb is ''be''; see {{slink||Negation}} below. The imperative here refers to second-person forms; constructions for other persons may be formed periphrastically, e.g. ''Let's (let us) go''; ''Let them eat cake''.

A dependent clause may be ''finite'' (based on a [[finite verb]], as independent clauses are), or [[non-finite clause|''non-finite'']] (based on a verb in the form of an infinitive or participle). Particular types of dependent clause include [[English relative clauses|relative clauses]], [[content clause]]s and [[adverbial clause]]s.

In certain instances, clauses use a verb conjugated in the subjunctive mood; see [[English subjunctive]].

Clauses can be nested within each other, sometimes up to several levels. For example, the sentence ''I know the woman who says she saw your son drinking beer'' contains a non-finite clause (''drinking beer'') within a content clause (''she saw your son drinking beer'') within a relative clause (''who says she saw your son drinking beer'') within an independent declarative clause (the whole sentence).

===Non-finite clauses===
A [[non-finite clause]] is one in which the main verb is in a non-finite form, namely an [[infinitive]], [[past participle]], or ''-ing'' form ([[present participle]] or [[gerund]]); for how these forms are made, see [[English verbs]]. (Such a clause may also be referred to as an ''infinitive phrase'', ''participial phrase'', etc.)

The internal syntax of a non-finite clause is generally similar to that of a finite clause, except that there is usually no subject (and in some cases a missing complement; see below). The following types exist:
*[[bare infinitive]] clause, such as ''go to the party'' in the sentence ''let her go to the party''.
*''to''-[[Infinitive#Phrases_and_clauses|infinitive clause]], such as ''to go to the party''. Although there is no subject in such a clause, the performer of the action can (in some contexts) be expressed with a preceding prepositional phrase using ''for'': ''It would be a good idea '''for her''' to go to the party.'' The possibility of placing adjuncts between the ''to'' and the verb in such constructions has been the subject of dispute among [[prescriptive grammar]]ians; see [[split infinitive]].
*past participial clause (active type), such as ''made a cake'' and ''seen to it''. This is used in forming [[perfect aspect|perfect]] constructions (see below), as in ''he has made a cake''; ''I had seen to it''.
*present participial clause, such as ''being in good health''. When such a clause is used as an adjunct to a main clause, its subject is understood to be the same as that of the main clause; when this is not the case, a subject can be included in the participial clause: ''The king being in good health, his physician was able to take a few days' rest.''
*gerund clause. This has the same form as the above, but serves as a noun rather than an adjective or adverb. The pre-appending of a subject in this case (as in ''I don't like you drinking'', rather than the arguably more correct ''...your drinking'') is criticized by some prescriptive grammarians – see [[Fused participle]].

In certain uses, a non-finite clause contains a missing ([[zero (linguistics)|zero]]) item – this may be an object or complement of the verb, or the complement of a preposition within the clause (leaving the preposition "[[preposition stranding|stranded]]"). Examples of uses of such "passive" non-finite clauses are given below:  
*''to''-infinitive clauses – ''this is easy '''to use''''' (zero object of ''use''); ''he is the man '''to talk to''''' (zero complement of preposition ''to'').
*past participial clauses – as used in forming [[passive voice]] constructions (''the cake was '''made''''', with zero object of ''made''), and in some other uses, such as ''I want to get it '''seen to''''' (zero complement of ''to''). In many such cases the performer of the action can be expressed using a prepositional phrase with ''by'', as in ''the cake was made by Alan''.
*gerund clauses – particularly after ''want'' and ''need'', as in ''Your car wants/needs '''cleaning''''' (zero object of ''cleaning''), and ''You want/need your head '''seeing to''''' (zero complement of ''to'').

For details of the uses of such clauses, see {{slink||Uses of non-finite constructions}} below. See also [[English passive voice]] (particularly under [[English passive voice#Additional passive constructions|Additional passive constructions]]).

== Constituents of a clause ==

English is an [[subject-verb-object|SVO]] language, that is, in simple declarative sentences the order of the main components is ''subject–verb–object(s)'' (or ''subject–verb–complement'').

A typical finite clause consists of a [[English grammar#Noun phrases|noun phrase]] functioning as the [[subject (grammar)|subject]], a [[finite verb]], followed by any number of dependents of the verb. In some theories of grammar the verb and its dependents are taken to be a single component called a [[verb phrase]] or the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] of the clause; thus the clause can be said to consist of subject plus predicate.

Dependents include any number of [[complement (grammar)|complement]]s (especially a noun phrase functioning as the [[object (grammar)|object]]), and other [[modifier (grammar)|modifier]]s of the verb. Noun phrase constituents which are [[English personal pronouns|personal pronouns]] or (in formal registers) the pronoun [[whom|''who(m)'']] are marked for [[Grammatical case|case]], but otherwise it is word order alone that indicates which noun phrase is the subject and which the object.

The presence of complements depends on the pattern followed by the verb (for example, whether it is a [[transitive verb]], i.e. one taking a direct object). A given verb may allow a number of possible patterns (for example, the verb ''write'' may be either transitive, as in ''He writes letters'', or intransitive, as in ''He writes often'').

Some verbs can take two objects: an [[indirect object]] and a direct object. An indirect object precedes a direct one, as in ''He gave the dog a bone'' (where ''the dog'' is the indirect object and ''a bone'' the direct object). However the indirect object may also be replaced with a prepositional phrase, usually with the preposition ''to'' or ''for'', as in ''He gave a bone to the dog''. (The latter method is particularly common when the direct object is a [[personal pronoun]] and the indirect object is a stronger noun phrase: ''He gave it to the dog'' would be used rather than ?''He gave the dog it''.)

Adverbial adjuncts are often placed after the verb and object, as in ''I met John yesterday''. However other positions in the sentence are also possible; see {{slink|English grammar|Adverbs}}, and for "phrasal" particles, [[Phrasal verb]]. Another adverb which is subject to special rules is the [[negation (linguistics)|negating]] word ''not''; see {{slink||Negation}} below.

Objects normally precede other complements, as in ''I told him to fetch it'' (where ''him'' is the object, and the infinitive phrase ''to fetch it'' is a further complement). Other possible complements include [[English grammar#Prepositions|prepositional phrases]], such as ''for Jim'' in the clause ''They waited for Jim''; [[predicative expression]]s, such as ''red'' in ''The ball is red''; subordinate clauses, which may be introduced by a [[subordinating conjunction]] such as ''if'', ''when'', ''because'', ''that'', for example the [[content clause|''that''-clause]] in ''I suggest that you wait for her''; and non-finite clauses, such as ''eating jelly'' in the sentence ''I like eating jelly''.

Many English verbs are used together with a particle (such as ''in'' or ''away'') and with preposition phrases in constructions that are commonly referred to as "phrasal verbs". These complements often modify the meaning of the verb in an unpredictable way, and a verb-particle combination such as ''give up'' can be considered a single lexical item. The position of such particles in the clause is subject to different rules from other adverbs; for details see [[Phrasal verb]].

English is not a "pro-drop" (specifically, [[null-subject language|null-subject]]) language – that is, unlike some languages, English requires that the subject of a clause always be expressed explicitly, even if it can be deduced from the form of the verb and the context, and even if it has no meaningful referent, as in the sentence ''It is raining'', where the subject ''it'' is a [[dummy pronoun]]. Imperative and non-finite clauses are exceptions, in that they usually do not have a subject expressed.

[[Adjunct (grammar)|Adjunct]]s are constituents which are not required by the main verb, and can be removed without leaving behind something ungrammatical. Adjuncts are usually [[adverb]]s or [[adverbial]] phrases or clauses.

Many clauses have as their finite verb an [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]], which governs a non-finite form of a lexical (or other auxiliary) verb. For clauses of this type, see {{slink||Clauses with auxiliary verbs}} below.

===Variations on SVO pattern===

Variations on the basic SVO pattern occur in certain types of clause. The subject is absent in most imperative clauses and most non-finite clauses (see the {{slink|Types of clause}} and {{slink||Non-finite clauses}} sections). For cases in which the verb or a verb complement is omitted, see {{slink||Elliptical clauses}}.

The verb and subject are [[inversion (grammar)|inverted]] in most interrogative clauses. This requires that the verb be an [[English auxiliaries|auxiliary]] or [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] (and [[do-support|''do''-support]] is used to provide an auxiliary if there is otherwise no invertible verb). The same type of inversion occurs in certain other types of clause, particularly main clauses beginning with an adjunct having negative force (''Never '''have I''' witnessed such carnage''), and some dependent clauses expressing a condition ('''''Should you''' decide to come,...''). For details see [[subject–auxiliary inversion]] and [[negative inversion]].

A somewhat different type of inversion may involve a wider set of verbs (as in ''After the sun comes the rain''); see [[subject–verb inversion]].

In certain types of clause an object or other complement becomes zero or is brought to the front of the clause: see {{slink||Fronting and zeroing}}.

==Clauses with auxiliary verbs==
In many English clauses, the finite verb is an [[auxiliary verb]], whose complement is some type of non-finite clause. For example, in the clause ''he is eating his dinner'', the finite verb is the auxiliary ''is'', whose complement is the participial clause ''eating his dinner''. In some cases the non-finite clause itself has an auxiliary as its main verb, with another embedded non-finite clause as complement. For example:
* ''He has (been (eating his dinner)).''
Here ''eating his dinner'' is the complement of ''been'', and ''been eating his dinner'' is the complement of ''has''.

The form of each lexical or auxiliary verb (apart from the first) is determined by the auxiliary preceding it. The first auxiliary is conjugated as a finite verb in present or past tense: the modals are invariant, but the other auxiliaries may take the forms ''have'', ''has'', ''had'', ''am'', ''is'', ''are'', ''be'' ([[English subjunctive|subjunctive]]), ''was'', ''were'', ''do'', ''does'', ''did''. (If the clause being considered is a non-finite clause, then the initial auxiliary form may be ''having'', ''(to) have'', ''being'', or ''(to) be''.)

The principal auxiliaries and the verb forms they govern are:
* [[English modal verbs|Modal verbs]] (''will'', ''can'', ''could'', etc.). They govern a bare infinitive (or ''to''-infinitive in the case of ''ought'' and ''used'').
* The verb ''have'' (and its inflected forms) to express [[perfect aspect]]. These govern a past participle (with an active meaning).
* The verb ''be'' (and inflected forms) to express [[progressive aspect]]. These govern a present participle.
* The verb ''be'' (and inflected forms) to express [[passive voice]]. These govern a past participle (used passively, i.e. with a [[zero (linguistics)|zero]] object or preposition complement).
* The verb ''do'' (and inflected forms) to supply an auxiliary in functions where one is required, or to provide emphasis. This is described in more detail in the article on [[do-support|''do''-support]].

A modal verb, if present, comes first. Any other auxiliaries come in the order listed above, namely perfect ''have'' followed by progressive ''be'' followed by passive ''be''.&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p304&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The auxiliary ''do'' is not used in combination with any other auxiliary. Otherwise, the above auxiliaries can be used in any combination (but with no more than one instance from each group).

A clause containing the maximum number of auxiliaries might therefore be ''I will have been being operated on for six hours.'' Here the modal ''will'' is the finite verb; perfect ''have'' is in bare infinitive form (since it follows a modal), progressive ''be'' is in the past participle form ''been'' (following perfect ''have''), passive ''be'' is in the present participle form ''being'' (following progressive ''be''), and the lexical verb is in the past participle form ''operated'' (following passive ''be''; here it is the dependent preposition ''on'' that has zero complement).

Constructions of this type serve a variety of functions, including the expression of [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical voice|voice]] and [[modality (grammar)|modality]]. The meaning of combinations of these auxiliary verbs are presented in more detail [[#Meanings of clauses using auxiliary verbs|later in this article]].

Some of these constructions are described, particularly in teaching contexts, as [[grammatical tense|''tenses'']] – for example, ''is eating'' is represented as the "present progressive tense" of ''eat''. (This terminology is rejected by many theoretical grammarians, since the construction does not serve purely to indicate present time, but also encodes aspectual information.) The series of auxiliaries and non-finite verb form is treated as a unit. Thus in the examples above, the strings ''is eating'' and ''has been eating'' may be presented as forms of the verb ''eat'', with ''his dinner'' serving as their object. (From a theoretical perspective, these verb series are examples of [[catena (linguistics)|catenae]].)

Non-finite constructions exist for combinations of auxiliary verbs other than the modals verbs or ''do'':
*infinitive: ''(to) take'', ''(to) be taken'', ''(to) be taking'', ''(to) have been taking'', etc.
*present participial (or gerund): ''taking'', ''being taken'', ''having taken'', etc. (but not normally in the progressive cases)

The verbs ''ought'' and ''used'' differ from other modals in that they require the ''to''-infinitive rather than the bare infinitive: ''He ought to go''; ''We used to go'' (for this reason they are not always classified as modals). There are certain other auxiliary-like expressions that are variously classified:
*''(be) going to''
*''have to''
*''am to'', ''was to'', etc.
*''(be) able to''
*''(be) about to''

==Fronting and zeroing==
In interrogative and relative clauses, [[wh-fronting|''wh''-fronting]] occurs; that is, the interrogative word or relative pronoun (or in some cases a phrase containing it) is brought to the front of the clause: ''What did you see?'' (the interrogative word ''what'' comes first even though it is the object); ''The man to whom you gave the book...'' (the phrase ''to whom'', containing the relative pronoun, comes to the front of the relative clause; for more detail on relative clauses see [[English relative clauses]]).

Fronting of various elements can also occur for reasons of [[focus (linguistics)|focus]]; occasionally even an object or other verbal complement can be fronted rather than appear in its usual position after the verb, as in ''I met Tom yesterday, but '''Jane''' I haven't seen for ages''. (For cases in which fronting is accompanied by inversion of subject and verb, see [[negative inversion]] and [[subject–verb inversion]].)

In certain types of non-finite clause ("passive" types; see [[#Non-finite clauses|non-finite clauses]] above), and in some relative clauses, an object or a preposition complement is absent (becomes [[zero (linguistics)|zero]]). For example, in ''I like the cake you made'', the words ''you made'' form a [[reduced relative clause]] in which the verb ''made'' has zero object. This can produce [[preposition stranding]] (as can ''wh''-fronting): ''I like the song you were listening to''; ''Which chair did you sit on?''

== Negation ==
A clause is [[negation (linguistics)|negated]] by the inclusion of the word ''not'':
*In a finite indicative clause in which the finite verb is an auxiliary or copula, the word ''not'' comes after that verb, often forming a [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] in ''n't'': ''He will not (won't) win''.
*In a finite indicative clause in which there is otherwise no auxiliary or copula, [[do-support|''do''-support]] is used to provide one: ''He does not (doesn't) want to win''.
*In the above clause types, if there is inversion (for example, because the sentence is interrogative), the subject may come after the verb and before ''not'', or after the contraction in ''n't'': ''Do you not (Don't you) want to win?'' (In the case of inversion expressing a condition, the contracted form is not possible: ''Should you not'' (not: *''Shouldn't you'') ''wish to attend...''    
*Negative imperatives are formed with ''do''-support, even in the case of the copula: ''Don't be silly!''
*The negative of the present subjunctive is made by placing ''not'' before the verb: ''...that you not meet us''; ''...that he not be punished''. The past subjunctive ''were'' is negated like the indicative (''were not'', ''weren't'').
*A non-finite clause is negated by placing ''not'' before the verb form: ''not to be outdone'' (sometimes ''not'' is placed after ''to'' in such clauses), ''not knowing what to do''.

==Elliptical clauses==
Certain clauses display [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]], where some component is omitted, usually by way of avoidance of repetition. Examples include:
*omitted verb between subject and complement, as in ''You love me, and '''I you''''' (where the same verb ''love'' is understood between ''I' and ''you'').
*[[tag questions]], as in ''He can't speak French, '''can he'''?'' (where the infinitive clause ''speak French'' is understood to be the dependent of ''can'').
*similar short sentences or clauses such as ''I can'', ''there is'', ''we will'', etc., where the omitted non-finite clause or other complement is understood from what has gone before (for examples involving inversion, such as ''so/neither do I'', see [[subject–auxiliary inversion]]).
For more analysis and further examples, see [[Verb phrase ellipsis]].

==Meanings of clauses using auxiliary verbs==

===Overview===
The various constructions with auxiliary verbs (see {{slink||Clauses with auxiliary verbs}} above) can be used to express [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] (with perfective ''have'' and progressive ''be''), [[grammatical voice|voice]] (with passive ''be'') and [[modality (linguistics)|modality]] (with the modal verbs).

English clauses can be described as having [[progressive aspect]], [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect aspect]], neither ("simple aspect"), or both ("perfect progressive aspect"). They can also be described as having [[active voice]] or [[passive voice]]. The following table shows these combinations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=897|title=What's will?|date=10 December 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

The constructions given above are third-person singular present indicative. However, by changing the form of the finite (i.e. first) verb in each case, equivalent forms can be constructed for other persons and numbers, for past tense, and for imperative and [[English subjunctive|subjunctive]] mood (although the imperative is not normally used with perfect aspect, and only rarely with progressive).

The meanings of the aspects are as follows:
* The simple constructions can be used to express habitual action. In many contexts they can also be used to express single completed actions.
* [[Progressive tense|Progressive]] constructions denote ongoing activity at a specific point of time or continuous activity over an extent of time.&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p306&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Perfect constructions are used to express actions or events that happened before a point in time, with an emphasis on the continuing effects of these at this point of time. (See also [[Relative and absolute tense]].)
* Perfect progressive constructions are used to express ongoing activity that extends to a certain point in time.

(The meaning of the passive voice can also be expressed with ''get'' in some cases, particularly when adverse consequences are implied, as in ''She got injured''. However ''get'' is not a grammatical auxiliary; for example, it requires ''do''-support for negation and questions.)

[[English modal verbs|Modal verbs]] can also be used, such as "will" used as above in future constructions and "would" in conditional constructions. These serve as uninflected [[auxiliary verb]]s, even in the third person singular. Most of these have multiple modal uses, depending on context. With the exception of ''ought'', all are followed by the short form of the main verb's infinitive (that is, without the particle ''to''). ''Dare'' and ''need'', are infrequently used as modals and are much more frequently used instead as main verbs that are inflected with ''-s'' in the present tense third person singular; when they are used as main verbs, the infinitive following them includes the particle ''to''.

This is illustrated in the table below with the modal ''might''.
{| class="wikitable"

|-
| might || have || || || taken
|-
| might || have || || been || taken
|-
| might || have || been || || taking
|-
| might || have || been || being || taken
|-
|}
The modals are invariant, so in this case it is not possible to inflect for tense or mood (except insofar as certain modals express these categories; for example, ''could'' may serve as a past tense of ''can''). There are no imperative or non-finite forms ([[periphrasis]] may be used in some cases; for example, infinitive clauses can be made with ''to be able to...'' or ''to be going to...'').

The modal ''will'', in some of its uses, expresses future time. Hence constructions using ''will'' as the modal in the above schema are often referred to as being instances of a [[future tense]]. Thus forms like ''will take'' can be called the simple future, ''will have taken'' the future perfect, and so on. Analogous terminology is used for the forms with ''would'' (sometimes ''should''); these are referred to as [[conditional mood|conditional]] (or "future-in-the-past") forms. Sometimes ''shall'' and ''should'' are also used in this way: see [[shall and will|''shall'' and ''will'']].

===Simple constructions===
The simple constructions can be used to express habitual action. In many contexts they can also be used to express single completed actions.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Affirmative !! Negative !! Interrogative !! Negative interrogative
|-
| Present || He writes || He does not write || Does he write? || Does he not write? / Doesn't he write?
|-
| Past || He wrote || He did not write || Did he write? || Did he not write? / Didn't he write?
|-
| Future (''will'') || He will write || He will not write || Will he write? || Will he not write? / Won't he write?
|-
| Conditional (''would'') || He would write || He would not write || Would he write? || Would he not write? / Wouldn't he write?
|}

The passive voice is formed using the appropriate form of the verb ''be'' followed by the past participle (more accurately called the '''passive participle''' in this context) of the main verb, e.g. "He is written."

==== Present====

The simple present has three main uses in English: First, it often identifies habitual or customary action referring to no specific time frame:
:''He writes about beavers'' (in the past, present, and future)
Second, it is used with [[stative verbs]] to refer to a present situation:
:''She knows a lot about beavers''
Third, it can have a future meaning in two contexts (though its use as an indicator of futurity is much less common than in many other languages):
:Scheduled future: ''She goes to Milwaukee on Tuesday'', ''I arrive tomorrow at 5:00''. 
:Future in a dependent clause: ''I will see you when I get there'', ''I will go tomorrow if I feel like it'', ''It will be Tuesday when I see you''.
 
The simple present has an intensive or emphatic construction with "do": ''He does write''. In the negative and interrogative constructions, of course, this is identical to the non-emphatic constructions.  It is typically used as a response to the question ''Does he write'', whether that question is expressed or implied, and says that indeed, he does write.

The different syntactic behavior of the [[negation#Grammar|negative]] particle ''not'' and the negative inflectional suffix ''-n't'' in the interrogative constructions is also worth noting.  In formal [[literary language|literary English]] of the sort in which contractions are avoided, ''not'' attaches itself to the main verb: ''Does he not write?''  When the colloquial contraction ''-n't'' is used, this attaches itself to the auxiliary ''do'': ''Doesn't he write?''  This in fact is a contraction of a more archaic word order, still occasionally found in poetry: *''Does not he write?'''''

====Past====
The simple past is also called the preterite.

The preterite is used for the English simple (non-iterative or iterative, but not progressive) past tense.  ''He '''wrote''' two more chapters about the dam at Kashagawigamog Lake.''

This tense is used for a single event in the past (''I went there yesterday''), for past habitual action (''I went there every day for a year''), and in chronological narration.  Like the present simple, it has an emphatic variant with "do": ''he did write''.

The simple past is distinct from the present perfect:
:''I ate fish'' (Simple statement of event[s] occurring in the past, with no reference to the present state.)
:''I have eaten fish'' (My present state is that eating fish is in my past.)

The preterite, when used to indicate habitual aspect, can often be replaced by a compound construction:
*''When I was young, I played football'' '''or''' ''When I was young, I played football every Saturday.'' (past tense unmarked for aspect, but by lexical context implying habituality, with either a specific or a non-specific time frame)
*''When I was young, I used to play football.'' (periphrastic construction explicitly indicating habituality, with a relatively non-specific time frame in the past)
*''When I was young, I would play football every Saturday.'' (periphrastic construction explicitly indicating habituality, with a specific time frame in the past)

==== Future ====

English does not have a dedicated future tense in the sense of a morphological form that always indicates what the speaker views as facts about the future.

''Shall'' can be used in place of ''will'': see the article [[Shall and Will]] for a discussion of the two auxiliary verbs used to form the simple future in English.

''Will'' and ''would'' can be used with a different meaning to futurity or conditionality:
*You ''will'' obey me! (''insistence'')
*I will not do it! (''refusal, i.e. negative insistence'')
*He will probably be home now. (''probability'')
*Usually, whenever I get home, I will drink a cup of tea. (''present habitual action'')
*At that time, I would always drink tea in the morning. (''past habitual action, similar to "used to"'')
*I would not do that (if I were you). (''suggestion, or implied conditional action'')

The ''will'' construction can be used to indicate what the  speaker views as facts about the future:

:''The sun will rise tomorrow at 6:14 AM.''

It can also indicate a combination of futurity and intentional or volitional modality:

:''He will go there if he can.''
:''I '''will''' pass this exam.''

It can also indicate predictive modality — what the speaker intends as predictions about the future:

:''It will rain later this week.''

The ''will'' construction is occasionally used for statements about the present to indicate that they are speculative:
:''Jack: "I have not eaten a thing all day."''
:''Jill: "Well, I suppose you will be hungry now."''

:''Jack: "There is a woman coming up the drive."''
:''Jill: "That will be my mother."''

The ''will'' construction can be used to indicate strong volition in the present in the first person:

:''At this moment I will tolerate no dissent.''

It can also be used to indicate habituality in the past, present and future:

:''He will make trouble, won't he?''

There is also a [[going-to future|future with "go"]] which is used with the infinitive of the action verb especially for intended actions and for the weather, and which is generally more common in colloquial speech:
:''I am going to write a book some day.''
:''I think that it is going to rain.''
The will/shall construction can be used for spontaneous decisions:
:''Jack: "I think that we should have a barbecue!"''
:''Jill: "Good idea! I shall go get the coal."''

==== Present subjunctive ====

This form is always identical to the infinitive.  This means that apart from the verb ''to be'', it is distinct from the indicative present only in the third person singular and the obsolete second person singular.

It is used to express wishes about the present or future:
:''God save our queen.''  (Not:  ''God saves our queen'', which means that it actually happens)

It can be used (in formal writing) to express present doubt, especially after ''if'', ''whether'', and ''lest'' and in set phrases:

:''If that have any validity....''
:''If that be true,....''
:''If he need go,....''
:''If music be the food of love,....''
:''Whether that be true or not,....''
:''Lest he arrive too soon,....''
:''Be that as it may,....''

The subordinate conjunction ''whether'' can be replaced by inversion of ''be'' and the subject:

:''Be that true or not,....''

It is also used in a mandative sense:
:''He insists that his son have a more conventional celebration.'' (He strongly wants that to be true in the future; contrast with the indicative usage ''He insists that his son has a more conventional celebration'', in which he asserts that it is a fact.)
:''It is important that the process be carried out accurately.''
:''I shall work for him on condition that he pay me weekly.''

The present subjunctive can be written in the passive voice as in

:''If it be written,....''

====Conditional ====

The conditional present is formed by combining the modal auxiliary ''would'' (never *''woulds'', not even in the third person singular) with the infinitive (without ''to'') of the main verb:

The conditional present is used principally in a main clause accompanied by an implicit or explicit doubt or "if-clause"; it may refer to conditional statements in present or future time:
:''I would like to pay now if it is not too much trouble.'' (in present time; doubt of possibility is explicit)
:''I would like to pay now.'' (in present time; doubt is implicit)
:''I would go tomorrow if she asked me.'' (in future time; doubt is explicit)
:''I would go tomorrow.'' (in future time; doubt is implicit)

Some varieties of English regularly use ''would'' (often shortened to ''(I)'d'') in ''if'' clauses, but this is often considered non-standard:  ''If you'd leave now, you'd be on time''. Such use of ''would'' is widespread especially in spoken US English in all sectors of society, but these forms are not usually used in writing that is more formal. Nevertheless, some reliable sources simply label this usage as acceptable US English and no longer label it as colloquial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perfectyourenglish.com/writing/american-and-british-usage-2.htm|title=Difference between British and American English usage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearson Longman, Longman Exams Dictionary, grammar guide:
It is possible to use ''would'' in both clauses in US English but not in British English: US: The blockades '''wouldn't happen''' if the police '''would be firmer''' with the strikers. Br: The blockades '''wouldn't happen''' if the police '''were firmer''' with the strikers.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are exceptions, however, where ''would'' is used in British English too in seemingly counterfactual conditions, but these can usually be interpreted as a modal use of ''would'': ''If you would listen to me once in a while, you might learn something''.&lt;ref name="lingua.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lingua.org.uk/eq&amp;a.html|title=NELL.links|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.wordreference.com/showpost.php?p=5478593&amp;postcount=6|title=If clause|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases in which the action in the ''if'' clause takes place after that in the main clause, use of ''would'' in counterfactual conditions is however considered standard and correct usage in even formal UK and US usage: ''If it would make Bill happy, I'd [I would] give him the money.''&lt;ref name="lingua.org.uk"/&gt;
&lt;!--Example, source?: A student of English may also rarely encounter the construction of if+would as an archaic form.  --&gt;

The auxiliary verbs ''could'' and ''might'' can also be used to indicate the conditional mood, as in the following:

:''If the opportunity were here, I '''could do''' the job'' (= "If the opportunity were here, I '''would be able to do''' the job")
:''If the opportunity were here, I '''might do''' the job'' (= "If the opportunity were here,  '''maybe''' I '''would do''' the job")

=== Progressive constructions ===
[[Progressive tense|Progressive]] constructions denote ongoing activity at a specific point of time or continuous activity over an extent of time. All verbal constructions can be made progressive (e.g. "I have written" → "I have been writing"), and these constructions are very common. Progressive constructions are also known as "continuous".

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Affirmative !! Negative !! Interrogative !! Negative interrogative
|-
| Present || He is writing || He is not writing || Is he writing? || Is he not writing? / Isn't he writing?
|-
| Past || He was writing || He was not writing || Was he writing? || Was he not writing? / Wasn't he writing?
|-
| Future (''will'') || He will be writing || He will not be writing || Will he be writing?  || Will he not be writing? / Won't he be writing?
|-
| Conditional (''would'') || He would be writing || He would not be writing || Would he be writing?  || Would he not be writing? / Wouldn't he be writing?
|}

The passive voice of the progressive is formed by the present progressive of ''to be'' ("is being") followed by the past participle of the main verb ("written"), e.g. "He is being written."

==== Present ====

An important difference between the present progressive tense in English and many other languages with similar tenses (e.g. [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is that the English present progressive ''must'' be used in many circumstances.  In particular, a statement about an ongoing action at the present time normally ''must'' use the progressive ("I am writing a letter now" but not "*I write a letter now").  The simple present is used in the following circumstances:
*A habitual statement: "I write letters every day."
*A general statement: "People write letters when they cannot telephone."
*A narrative action told in the present tense: "I get home, then I write a letter, then I eat dinner, then the phone rings and it's my girlfriend."
*With verbs that refer to states rather than actions: "I feel lonely", "I see a bear", "I have a large car", "I am a doctor".

In the latter cases, the progressive is often possible, sometimes with different implications. Generally, it implies an action rather than a state, and an ongoing, often temporary situation.  For example, "I am feeling lonely" and "I am seeing a bear" specifically emphasize the perception of the feeling at the current time, which is implied to be temporary.

With "have" and "be" the present progressive is even clearer in imparting a meaning of "currently ongoing action".  Hence "??I am having a large car" would sound quite strange, and be almost uninterpretable, while "?I am being a doctor" still sounds strange but potentially might mean "I'm not a doctor but I'm temporarily trying to act like one".  But there are a number of quite acceptable usages of progressive "have" and "be":
*"I have a baby" (a small child currently exists in the world and I am its parent)  vs. "I am having a baby" (I am giving birth right now to a child)
*"John is a pest" (John generally acts in an annoying way) vs. "John is being a pest" (right now, John is acting in a way that is annoying)
*"I have a problem" (something in my world is wrong) vs. "I am having a problem" (right now, something in my world is going wrong); e.g. "I am having a problem finding my glasses" (right now, I'm looking for my glasses but I can't find them) vs. "I have a problem finding my glasses" (I often lose my glasses and can't find them).

This construction describes the simple engagement in a present activity, with the focus on action in progress "at this very moment".  It too can indicate a future, particularly when discussing plans already in place: ''I am flying to Paris tomorrow''.  Used with "always" it suggests irritation; compare ''He always does that'' (neutral) with ''He is always doing that'' (and it annoys me).
Word order differs here in the negative interrogative between the more formal ''is he not writing'' and the colloquial contraction ''isn't he writing''?

==== Past ====

The past progressive construction indicates ongoing action in the past

This construction is typically used for two events in parallel:
:''While I was washing the dishes, my wife was walking the dog.''
It can also be used for an interrupted action (the past simple being used for the interruption):
:''While I was washing the dishes, I heard a loud noise.''
Further, it can be used to indicate continuing action at a specific time in the past:
:''At three o'clock yesterday, I was working in the garden.''

It can also be used to refer to past action that occurred over a range of time and is viewed as an ongoing situation:

:''I was working in the garden all day yesterday'' (it was an ongoing process), as opposed to ''I worked in the garden all day yesterday'' (and I am viewing all of that action as a unitary event)

====Future ====

This construction is used especially to indicate that an event will be in progress at a particular point in the future: ''This time tomorrow I will / shall be taking my driving test.''

The passive construction ''It will be being written'' is rarely used. If it is desired to express future progressivity in the passive voice, the construction ''It will be in the process of being written'' can be used.

==== Conditional  ====

The conditional present progressive is used for the continuous aspect of the conditional construction; it describes a situation that would now be prevailing had it not been for some intervening event:
: ''Today she would be exercising if it were not for her injury.''
: ''He would be working today had he not been allowed time off.''

(For the use of ''would'' in both clauses, see note and sources at end of section on [[English clause syntax#Conditional|conditional]] above.)

The passive voice of the conditional present progressive can be formed as ''It would be being written'', but since this construction is awkward the form ''It would be in the process of being written'' would be more common.

=== Perfect constructions ===
Perfect constructions are used to express actions or events that happened before a point in time, with an emphasis on the continuing effects of these at this point of time.

The following table shows examples of perfect constructions being used with the pronoun "he":

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Affirmative !! Negative !! Interrogative !! Negative interrogative
|-
| Present || He has written || He has not written || Has he written? || Has he not written? / Hasn't he written?
|-
| Past || He had written || He had not written || Had he written? || Had he not written? / Hadn't he written?
|-
| Future (''will'') || He will have written || He will not have written || Will he have written?  || Will he not have written? / Won't he have written?
|-
| Conditional (''would'') || He would have written || He would not have written || Would he have written?  || Would he not have written? / Wouldn't he have written?
|}

The passive voice is formed with by the present perfect of ''to be'' ("been") followed by the past participle of the main verb, e.g. "He has been written."

==== Present ====
The present perfect was traditionally just called the perfect.

The distinction between the past (''I did'') and the present perfect (''I have done'') can be subtle.  In general, the present perfect occurs in cases where there is an explicitly or implicitly established present frame of reference.  When the frame of reference is explicit, such as in the sentence "Whenever I get home, usually John '''has''' already '''arrived'''", the usage of the present perfect is clear, but in other cases it is less obvious.

*When an action indicates a change of state, the present perfect indicates that the resulting state still applies. "I have eaten" means "... and I'm no longer hungry", whereas "I ate" has no such implication. "The sign has changed" means "... and it is now different, so pay attention", whereas "The sign changed" does not specifically have that meaning; e.g. perhaps the sign changed back again.
*When a repeated or prolonged action is specified, the present perfect indicates that the time period in question goes up to the present. "I have visited Paris three times" specifically means "... in my life, up to the present time" while "I visited Paris three times" would normally only be used when a smaller time period is specifically indicated. "I have lived in Paris for five years" specifically means "I lived in Paris for five years some uncertain time ago and I don't live there now. I have an experience of Paris" (it is, however, relevant to a current conversation; the importance is that of an experience rather than of the specific time of getting that experience) while "I lived in Paris for five years" implies "You (the listener) know what specific time I am talking about and the time when I lived in Paris is as important as the fact that I lived there." If one wants to imply that he/she still lives in Paris, he/she should ideally say: "I have been living in Paris for 5 years". This would imply an ongoing process of still living in Paris. However, people might use Present Perfect for an ongoing process, too and that is why you might hear a lot of follow up questions in conversations.
*When an explicitly past frame of reference is established by mentioning a particular time in the past, the present perfect cannot normally be used. That is, "I ate two minutes ago" not "*I have eaten two minutes ago" regardless of whether I'm hungry or not currently.
*With "already" or "yet", traditional usage calls for the present perfect: "Have you eaten yet?  Yes, I've already eaten." However, current informal American speech tends to use the simple past: "Did you eat yet? Yes, I ate already."

This construction indicates that a past event has one of a range of possible relationships to the present.  This relationship may involve a focus on present result: ''He has written a very fine book'' (and look, here it is, we have it now).  Alternatively, it may indicate a period which includes the present:  ''I have lived here since my youth'' (and I still do).  Compare: ''Have you written a letter this morning?'' (it is still morning) with ''Did you write a letter this morning?'' (it is now afternoon).  The perfect construction is frequently used with the adverbs ''already'' or ''recently'' or with ''since'' clauses. The present perfect can identify habitual and continuing actions (''I have written letters since I was ten years old.''), continuous and ongoing actions (''I have lived here for fifteen years.''), or completed actions that still affect the present situation (''I have visited Paris twice'' (and the memory of the experience is still with me)).

In addition to these normal uses where the event is viewed from the present, the “have done” construct is used with a future perspective in temporal clauses where other languages would use the future perfect: ''When you have written it, show it to me''.

The term "perfect" was first applied in discussions of Latin grammar, to refer to a tense which expresses a completed action ("perfect" in the sense of "finished"). It was then applied to a French tense which has a similar use to the Latin perfect, and then was transferred to the English tense which looks morphologically something like the French perfect. In fact, the English perfect is often used precisely in situations where Latin would use the imperfect&amp;nbsp;— for past actions which are not finished but continue into the present.

=====''Have got''=====
In colloquial English, particularly British English, the present perfect of the verb ''get'', namely ''have got'' or ''has got'', is frequently used in place of the simple present indicative of ''have'' (i.e. ''have'' or ''has'') when denoting [[possession (linguistics)|possession]], broadly defined. For example:
*Formal: ''I have three brothers''; ''Does he have a car?''
*Informal: ''I've got three brothers''; ''Has he got a car?''
Note that in American English, the form ''got'' is used in this idiom, even though the standard past participle of ''get'' is ''gotten''.

The same applies in the expression of present obligation: ''I've got to go now'' may be used in place of ''I [[have to]] (must) go now''.

In very informal registers, the contracted form of ''have'' or ''has'' may be omitted altogether: ''I got three brothers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peterviney.wordpress.com/about/elt-articles/have-got/|title=Have got|date=29 March 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Past ====
The past perfect is also known as the '''pluperfect'''; it is formed by combining the preterite of ''to have'' with the past participle of the main verb:

The past perfect is used when the action occurred in the past before another action in the past. It is used when speaking of the past to indicate the relative time of two past actions, one occurring before the other; i.e. a "past before the past".

The past time of perspective could be stated explicitly:

:''He had already left when we arrived.''

or it can be understood from previous information:

:''I was eating....I had invited Jim to the meal but he was unable to attend.''  (i.e., I invited him before I started eating)

The past time of perspective can simply be implied by the context:

:''I had lost my way.'' (understood as prior to a later but still past event I am now describing, for example, "when I met the bear".)

It is sometimes possible to use the simple past instead of the past perfect, but only where there is no ambiguity in the meaning. For instance, the second example above could be written:

:''I was eating....I invited Jim to the meal but he was unable to attend''

Understood within the above context, this still means that I first invited Jim then later ate the meal (without him).

However, concurrent past events are also possible, indicated by dual simple past tenses in both verbs. Consider the following:

:''He left when we arrived.''

This means both past events happened at the same time: he left at the same time as we arrived.

The past perfect can also be used to express a [[counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] statement about the past:

:''If you '''had done''' the cleaning by now, you would not need to do it now''

Here, the first clause refers to an unreal state in the past (without any comparison of the timing of multiple past events), and the entire construction is a [[conditional sentence]].

==== Future ====
The future perfect is formed by combining, in this order, ''will'' or ''shall'', the auxiliary verb ''have'', and the past participle of the main verb. It indicates an action that either is completed sometime prior to a future time of perspective or an ongoing action that continues to a future time of perspective:
: ''I shall have finished my essay by Thursday.''
: ''By then she will have been there for three weeks.''

====Conditional ====

The [[conditional perfect]] construction is used for conditional situations occurring in the past; it expresses thoughts which are or may be contrary to present fact:
:''I would have set an extra place if I had known you were coming.'' (The fact that an extra place was not set is implicit; the conditioning event (''I had known'') is explicit)
:''I would have set an extra place, but I did not because Mother said you were not coming.'' (The fact that a place was not set is explicit; the conditioning event is implicit)
:''I would have set an extra place.'' (The fact that a place was not set is implicit, and the conditioning event is implicit)

Some varieties of English regularly use ''would have'' (often shortened to ''(I)'d have'') in ''if'' clauses, but this is often non-standard: ''If you (would)'ve told me, we could've done something about it''. Such use of ''would'' is widespread especially in spoken US English in all sectors of society, but is incorrect and is not usually used in more formal writing. (See note and sources at end of section on [[English verbs#Conditional|conditional]] above.)

There are exceptions, however, where ''would'' is used in British English too in seemingly counterfactual conditions, but these can usually be interpreted as a modal use of ''would'': ''If you would have listened to me once in a while, you might have learned something''. In cases in which the action in the ''if'' clause takes place after that in the main clause, use of ''would'' in ''if'' clauses is however considered standard and correct usage in even formal UK and US usage: ''If it would have made Bill happy, I'd [I would] have given him the money.'' (See note and sources at end of section on [[English verbs#Conditional|conditional]] above.)

=== Perfect progressive constructions ===
Perfect progressive constructions (or perfect continuous constructions) are used to express ongoing activity that extends to a certain point in time.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Affirmative !! Negative !! Interrogative !! Negative interrogative
|-
| Present || He has been writing || He has not been writing || Has he been writing? || Has he not been writing? / Hasn't he been writing?
|-
| Past || He had been writing || He had not been writing || Had he been writing? || Had he not been writing? / Hadn't he been writing?
|-
| Future (''will'') || He will have been writing || He will not have been writing || Will he have been writing?  || Will he not have been writing? / Won't he have been writing?
|-
| Conditional (''would'') || He would have been writing || He would not have been writing || Would he have been writing?  || Would he not have been writing? / Wouldn't he have been writing?
|}

For passive voice clauses, the present participle ("writing") is replaced with "being" followed by the past participle ("being written").

====Present====

It is used for unbroken action in the past which continues right up to the present.  ''I have been writing this paper all morning'' (and still am).

The present perfect progressive is used for denoting the action which was in progress and has just finished or is still going on.
For example,
: ''Why are your eyes red?&amp;nbsp;– I have been crying since morning.'' (The action has already finished but was in progress for some time)
: ''She has been working here for two years already and she is happy.'' (The action is still in progress).

Sentences referring to an expanse of time use the present perfect continuous if ongoing action (not a static situation) is referred to. For example,
:''How long have you been working here?'' — ''I have been working here for three years''
However, with [[stative verb]]s (such as see, want, like, etc.), or if the situation is considered permanent, the present perfect non-progressive construction is used.
For example,
:''How long have you known her?'' — ''I have known her since childhood''

Thus, if the whole period is referred to, ''for'' is used, but when the reference is to the starting point of the action, ''since'' is used.

The construction ''It has been being written'', while following the usual pattern for the formation of the passive voice, is very rarely used. Occasionally, when it is desired to express the receiving of an action in the past and continuing to the present, the phrasal construction ''It has been in the process of being written'' is used. Here the present perfect construction is applied to ''to be'', and the continuity and the passive voice are applied to the main verb in non-finite form in a noun phrase.

==== Past ====

The past perfect progressive is also known as the '''pluperfect progressive ''', the '''past perfect continuous''', and the '''pluperfect continuous'''. It is formed by combining, in this order, the preterite of ''to have'', the past participle of ''to be'', and the present participle of the main verb.

The past perfect progressive relates to the past perfect as the present perfect progressive relates to the present perfect.

The construction ''It had been being written'' is very rarely used. To convey the past perfect progressive in the passive voice, the construction ''It had been in the process of being written'' can be used.

==== Future ====

The future perfect progressive, also called the future perfect continuous, is formed by combining, in this order, ''will'' or ''shall'', the auxiliary ''have'', the past participle ''been'', and the present participle of the main verb.

This construction is used for an event that will still be in progress at a certain point in the future:  ''By 8:00 he will have been writing for five hours'' (and will still be doing so).

The construction ''It will have been being written'' is never used. The construction ''It will have been in the process of being written'' can be used to indicate the continuous receiving of an action prior to some time in the future.

==== Conditional ====

Rather than the very rarely used awkward construction ''It would have been being written'', the conditional perfect progressive can be expressed in the passive voice as in ''It would have been in the process of being written.''

===Subjunctive constructions===

====Past subjunctive====
The past subjunctive is used to express hypotheses about the present or future: it is used to describe unreal or hypothetical conditions.  It consists of the verb ''were'' in all persons and numbers (including the first and third persons singular), either as the main verb or as a helping verb combined with the infinitive of the main verb.

It usually appears in "''if'' clauses" of conditional sentences.
Examples include:
*''If I were rich, I would retire to the South of France.''
*''If I were a boy,....''

Especially in formal usage, ''if'' may be omitted and the order of the subject and ''were'' inverted:
*''Were I to speak, I would do so softly.'' (This is identical in meaning to ''If I were to speak,....'')

When ''if'' means ''when'' (a fact) then the indicative is used. Compare

*''If I were walking down the road, I would greet him.'' (The subjunctive is used for a hypothetical present situation; the main clause is in the conditional.)
*''If I was walking down the road, I would greet him.'' (The indicative is used for a fact about habitual actions in the past; the main clause is in the past time and habitual aspect.)

The imperfect subjunctive is also used in "''that'' clauses" after a wish:
*''I'd rather that it were more substantial.''
*''I wish she were here.''

This last example can be contrasted with ''I want her to be here'', in which the indicative rather than the subjunctive is used because there is a substantial possibility that the hypothesis is (or will be) true.

The imperfect subjunctive can be written in the passive voice as in

:''If it were written....''

or

:''Were it written....''

====Future subjunctive====

A future subjunctive for use in "''if'' clauses" can be constructed using the conjugated form of the verb "to be" plus the infinitive (including the particle ''to'') or by using the modal auxiliary verb "should" (though the ''should'' form is very unusual in American English):

:''If I were to die tomorrow, then you would inherit everything.''
:''If I should go, then will / would you feed the hens?''

These constructions can alternatively be expressed with inversion of the order of ''were'' or ''should'' and the subject, with ''if'' omitted:

:''Were I to die tomorrow, then you would inherit everything.''
:''Should I go, then will / would you feed the hens?''

If the ''were to'' construction is used in the "''if'' clause", the word ''would'' is used in the main clause; if the ''should'' form is used in the "''if'' clause", either ''will'' or ''would'' can be used in the main clause, depending on whether the event is very hypothetical (leading to the use of ''would'') or is quite possible (permitting the use of ''will'').

The passive voice can be applied to the future subjunctive as in any of the following:

:''If it were to be written tomorrow,....''
:''Were it to be written tomorrow,....''
:''If it should be written tomorrow,....''
or
:''Should it be written tomorrow,....''

== Uses of non-finite constructions ==

The various types of non-finite clauses described [[#Non-finite clauses|above]] have a number of uses besides the constructions with auxiliaries already described.

=== Infinitive ===

An infinitive phrase begins with the [[English verbs#Base form|base form]] of the verb. Infinitive phrases can be viewed as part of finite clauses where they are introduced in verb [[catena (linguistics)|catena]]e by an auxiliary verb or by a certain limited class of main verbs. They are also often frequently introduced by a main verb followed by the particle ''to''. Further, infinitives introduced by ''to'' can function as noun phrases, or even as modifiers of nouns. The following table illustrates these environments:

:::{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Infinitive !! Introduced by a (modal) auxiliary verb !! Introduced by a main verb !! Introduced by a main verb plus ''to'' !! Functioning as noun phrase !! Functioning as the modifier of a noun   
|-
| laugh || Do not '''laugh'''! || That made me '''laugh'''. || I tried not to '''laugh'''. || '''To laugh''' would have been unwise. || the reason '''to laugh'''
|- 
| leave || They may '''leave'''. || We let them '''leave'''. || They refused to '''leave'''. || '''To leave''' was not an option. || the thing '''to leave''' behind
|-
| expand || You should '''expand''' the explanation. || We had them '''expand''' the explanation. || We hope to '''expand''' the explanation. || '''To expand''' the explanation would have been folly. || the effort '''to expand'''  
|}

An [[infinitive]] phrase begins with the bare form of the first verb, and is usually co-ordinated by the word "to":
* I need to '''''get''' my work done''
* For them to '''''be''' with us in this time of crisis'' is evidence of their friendship.

When the semantic agent of the verb phrase occurs as the object in the co-ordinating clause, "to" does not occur:
* I heard them '''''shout'''''.

Infinitive phrases are used after particular verbs such as "want" or "need".

The placement of an adverbial modifier directly after the ''to'' of an infinitive phrase (''to slowly drift away'') is called a [[split infinitive]], and is sometimes regarded as a grammatical or stylistic error.

=== Present participle and gerund ===

A present participle phrase uses the [[English verbs#Present participle|present participle]] form of the verb, ending in "-ing".

It may be used in progressive constructions:
:::{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Infinitive !! Progressive active participle  
|-
| fix || The guy is '''fixing''' my bike.
|- 
| open || the flower '''opening''' up 
|-
| support || the news '''supporting''' the point
|- 
| drive || She is '''driving''' our car. 
|}

The present participle may be used in non-finite constructions such as the following:
* '''''Having''' spoken'', he turned and left.
* '''''Looking''' out the window'', he saw a car go by.
* '''''Having''' been beaten at poker'', he had little money left.
* I saw them '''''digging''' a hole''.

The present participle form of a verb may function as a noun, in which case it is referred to as a [[gerund]]. Gerunds typically appear as subject or object noun phrases, or even as the object of a preposition:

:::{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Infinitive !! Gerund as subject !! Gerund as object !! Gerund as object of a preposition  
|-
| solve || '''Solving''' problems is satisfying.  || I like '''solving''' problems. || No one is better at '''solving''' problems. 
|- 
| jog || '''Jogging''' is boring. || He has started '''jogging'''. || Before '''jogging''', she stretches. 
|-
| eat || '''Eating''' too much made me sick. || She avoids '''eating''' too much. || That prevents you from '''eating''' too much.   
|- 
| investigate || '''Investigating''' the facts won't hurt.|| We tried '''investigating''' the facts. || After '''investigating''' the facts, we made a decision. 
|}

Often distinguishing between a gerund and a progressive active participle is not easy; the line between the two non-finite verb forms is not clear.

A present participle may function as an adjective modifying a noun, in which case it is known as a gerundive: "The dancing girls".

=== Past participle ===

The [[English verbs#Past participle|past participles]] of [[Germanic strong verb|strong verb]]s in Germanic languages are irregular (e.g. ''driven''); their form is idiosyncratic. The past participles of [[Germanic weak verb|weak verb]]s, in contrast, are regular; their form is formed with the suffix ''-ed'' (e.g. ''fixed'', ''supported'', ''opened'').

Past participles are used in perfect and passive constructions:

:::{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Infinitive !! Perfect active participle !! Passive participle  
|-
| fix || He has '''fixed''' my bike || My bike was '''fixed'''. || 
|- 
| open || The flower has '''opened''' up. || The flower has been '''opened''' up. || 
|-
| support || The news has '''supported''' the point. || the point '''supported''' by the news
|- 
| drive || She has '''driven''' our car. || Our car should be '''driven''' often. 
|}

Past participles occur in a rare construction in English which may be compared with the [[Latin grammar#Ablative absolute|ablative absolute]] construction in [[Latin]]:
* With ''these words '''spoken''''', he turned and left.

As with present participles, past participles may function as adjectives: "the burnt logs".

[[Snake venom|Venom in snakes]] and some [[lizard]]s is a form of [[saliva]] that has been modified into [[venom]] over its evolutionary history.{{sfn|Hargreaves et al. (a)|2014}} In [[snake]]s, venom has evolved to kill or subdue prey, as well as to perform other diet-related functions.{{sfn|Casewell et al.|2013|pp=218-220}} The evolution of venom is thought to be responsible for the enormous expansion of snakes across the globe.{{sfn|Fry et al.|2012|pp=441-442}}{{sfn|Wuster et al.|2008}}{{sfn|Lomonte et al. (a)|2014|p=326}}

The evolutionary history of snake venom is a matter of debate. The common view of this history before 2014 was that venom originated just once among all [[Toxicofera]] approximately 170 million years ago, and then diversified into the wide range of venoms seen today.{{sfn|Fry et al.|2012|pp=434-436}} Under this hypothesis, the original toxicoferan venom was a very simple set of proteins that were assembled in a pair of glands. Subsequently, this set of proteins [[Adaptive radiation|diversified]] in the various lineages of toxicoferans, including Serpentes, [[Anguimorpha]], and [[Iguania]]. Several snake lineages subsequently lost the ability to produce venom, often due to a change in diet.{{sfn|Fry et al.|2012|pp=424-436}}{{sfn|Casewell et al.|2013|pp=224-227}}

The single-origin hypothesis suggests that the mechanism of evolution in most cases has been [[gene duplication]] followed by [[natural selection]] for [[Adaptation|adaptive traits]].{{sfn|Casewell et al.|2013|pp=222-223}} Some of the various adaptations produced by this process include venom more toxic to specific prey in several lineages,{{sfn|Barlow et al.|2009|pp=2447-2448}}{{sfn|Calvete et al.|2012|pp=4094-4098}}{{sfn|Li et al.|2005}} proteins that pre-digest prey,{{sfn|Mackessy|2010}} and a method to track down prey after a bite.{{sfn|Saviola et al.|2013}} These various adaptations of venom have also led to considerable debate about the definition of venom and venomous snakes.{{sfn|Fry et al.|2012|p=443}}

The idea that venom had a single evolutionary origin has been called into question by a 2015 study, which found that venom proteins had homologs in many other tissues in the [[Burmese python]].{{sfn|Reyes-Velasco et al.|2015}} The study therefore suggested that venom had evolved independently in a number of snake lineages.

==Evolutionary history==
The origin of venom is thought to have provided the catalyst for the rapid diversification of snakes in the [[Cenozoic]] period,{{sfn|Fry et al.|2012}} particularly to the [[Colubridae]] and their colonization of the [[Americas]].{{sfn|Wuster et al.|2008}} Scholars suggest that the reason for this huge expansion was the shift from a mechanical to a biochemical method of subduing prey.{{sfn|Lomonte et al. (a)|2014|pp=326-327}}{{sfn|Mackessy|2010|p=1464}} Snake venoms attack biological pathways and processes that are also targeted by venoms of other taxa; for instance, [[calcium channel]] blockers have been found in snakes, spiders, and [[cone snail]]s, thus suggesting that venom exhibits [[convergent evolution]].{{sfn|Casewell et al.|2013|pp=225-227}}

===Toxicofera hypothesis===
Until the use of [[DNA sequencing|gene sequencing]] to create [[phylogenetic tree]]s became practical, phylogenies were created on the basis of [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]. Such traditional phylogenies suggested that venom originated in multiple branches among [[Squamata]] approximately 100 million years ago.{{sfn|Fry et al.|2012|pp=434-436}} More recent studies using nuclear gene sequences found the presence of similar venom proteins in several lizards within a clade that was named "[[Toxicofera]]".{{sfn|Fry et al.|2012|pp=434-436}} This led to the theory that venom originated only once within the entire lineage approximately 170 million years ago. This ancestral venom consisted of a very simple set of proteins, assembled in a pair of glands.{{sfn|Fry et al.|2012|pp=434-436}} The venoms of the different lineages then diversified and evolved independently, along with their means of injecting venom into prey.{{sfn|Fry et al.|2012|pp=434-436}} This diversification included the independent evolution of front-fanged venom delivery from the ancestral rear-fanged venom delivery system.{{sfn|Fry|Wuster|2004|p=870}} The single origin hypothesis also suggests that venom systems subsequently atrophied, or were completely lost, independently in a number of lineages. The American “rat snakes,” such as ''[[Pantherophis guttatus]]'', lost their venom following the evolution of [[constriction]] as a means of prey capture. The independent evolution of constriction in the fish-eating aquatic genus ''[[Acrochordus]]'' also saw the degradation of the venom system. Two independent lineages, one terrestrial and one marine, that shifted to an egg-based diet, also possess the remnants of an atrophied venom system.{{sfn|Fry et al.|2012|p=443}}

===Independent origin hypothesis===
The view that venom evolved just once has recently been called into doubt. A study performed in 2014 found that homologs of 16 venom proteins, which had been used to support the single origin hypothesis, were all expressed at high levels in a number of body tissues.{{sfn|Hargreaves et al. (b)|2014|pp=153-155}} The authors therefore suggested that previous research, which had found venom proteins to be conserved across the supposed Toxicoferan lineage, might have misinterpreted the presence of more generic "housekeeping" genes across this lineage, as a result of only sampling certain tissues within the reptiles' bodies. Therefore, the authors suggested that instead of evolving just once in an ancestral reptile, snake venom evolved independently in a number of lineages.{{sfn|Hargreaves et al. (b)|2014|pp=153-155}} A 2015 study found that homologs of the so-called "toxic" genes were present in numerous tissues of a non-venomous snake, the [[Burmese python]]. Castoe stated that the team had found homologs to the venom genes in many tissues outside the oral glands, where venom genes might be expected. This demonstrated the weaknesses of only analyzing [[transcriptome]]s (the total [[messenger RNA]] in a cell).{{sfn|Reyes-Velasco et al.|2015}} The team suggested that pythons represented a period in snake evolution before major venom development. The researchers also found that the expansion of venom gene families occurred mostly in highly venomous [[Colubroidea|caenophidian snakes]] (also referred to as "colubroidian snakes"), thus suggesting that most venom evolution took place after this lineage diverged from other snakes.{{sfn|Reyes-Velasco et al.|2015}}

==Mechanisms of evolution==
[[File:1poc.png|thumb|right|[[Phospholipase A2]], an [[enzyme]] found in normal tissue that has been adapted in certain snake venoms. The example pictured here is found in [[bee sting]]s.]]

The primary mechanism for the diversification of venom is thought to be the [[gene duplication|duplication of gene]] coding for other tissues, followed by their expression in the venom glands. The proteins then evolved into various venom proteins through natural selection. This process, known as the birth-and-death model, is responsible for several of the protein recruitment events in snake venom.{{sfn|Casewell et al.|2013|p=223}} These duplications occurred in a variety of tissue types with a number of ancestral functions. Notable examples include [[Calciseptine#Three-fingered toxin family|3FTx]], ancestrally a [[neurotransmitter]] found in the brain, which has adapted into a neurotoxin that binds and blocks [[acetylcholine receptor]]s. Another example is [[phospholipase A2]] (PLA2) type IIA, ancestrally involved with [[inflammation|inflammatory processes]] in normal tissue, which has evolved into venom capable of triggering [[lipase]] activity and tissue destruction.{{sfn|Fry et al.|2012}} The change in function of PLA2, in particular, has been well documented; there is evidence of several separate gene duplication events, often associated with the origin of new snake species.{{sfn|Lynch|2007}} [[Non-allelic homologous recombination]] (or recombination between DNA sequences that are similar, but not [[allele]]s) has been proposed as the mechanism of duplication of PLA2 genes in rattlesnakes, as an explanation for its rapid evolution.{{sfn|Dowell et al.| 2016}} These venom proteins have also occasionally been recruited back into tissue genes.{{sfn|Casewell et al.|2013|p=223-224}} Protein recruitment events have occurred at different points in the evolutionary history of snakes. For example, the 3FTX protein family is absent in the viperid lineage, suggesting that it was recruited into snake venom after the viperid snakes branched off from the remaining colubroidae.{{sfn|Fry|Wuster|2004|p=871}}

:::&lt;small&gt; A cladogram adapted from Fry et al. (2012) showing a subset of suggested protein recruitment events, based on the "single-origin" or "toxicoferan" model of venom evolution. [A]: [[crotamine]] and [[cystatin]]. [B]: 12 toxin families, including [[Cysteine-rich secretory protein|CRiSPs]] and [[nerve growth factor]]s. [C]: 2 toxin families, including PLA2 Type III. [D]: 13 toxin families, including [[Calciseptine#Three-fingered toxin family|3FTx]] and [[metalloprotease]]. [E]: 2 toxin families, including PLA2 Type IIA. [F]: 2 toxin families, including PLA2 Type IB.{{sfn|Fry et al.|2012|p=435}} [–]: loss of venom.&lt;/small&gt;

There have been debates about whether the original gene duplication events occurred in a salivary gland or in body tissues themselves. The prevailing idea for many years is the birth-and-death model described above, in which genes in other body tissues are duplicated and then recruited to the venom gland before natural selection for toxicity.{{sfn|Fry|2005}} However, in 2014 a new model was proposed in which salivary protein genes are duplicated and then restricted to the venom gland.{{sfn|Hargreaves et al. (a)|2014}} This model does away with the recruitment hypothesis and cites the homology between certain venom and body genes as unrelated in the linear fashion described in the traditional birth-and-death model.{{sfn|Hargreaves et al. (a)|2014}}

Gene duplication is not the only way that venom has become more diverse. There have been instances of new venom proteins generated by [[alternative splicing]]. The [[Elapidae|Elapid]] snake ''[[Bungarus fasciatus]]'', for example, possesses a gene that is alternatively spliced to yield both a venom component and a physiological protein.{{sfn|Casewell et al.|2013|p=223-224}} Further diversification may have occurred by gene loss of specific venom components. For instance, the rattlesnake ancestor is believed to have had genes for neurotoxic PLA2 toxins, which are absent in modern non-neurotoxic ''Crotalus'' species.{{sfn|Dowell et al.| 2016}} The various recruitment events had resulted in snake venom evolving into a very complex mixture of proteins. The venom of rattlesnakes, for example, includes nearly 40 different proteins from different protein families,{{sfn|Gibbs|Mackessy|2009}} and other snake venoms have been found to contain more than 100 distinct proteins.{{sfn|Lomonte et al. (a)|2014|pp=326-327}} The composition of this mixture has been shown to vary geographically, and to be related to the prey species available in a certain region.{{sfn|Li et al.|2005}} Snake venom has generally evolved very quickly, with changes occurring faster in the venom than in the rest of the organism.{{sfn|Lomonte et al. (a)|2014|p=334}}

==Selection pressure==
Some traditional hypotheses of snake venom evolution have supported the idea that most snakes inject far more venom into their prey than is required to kill them; thus, venom composition would not be subject to natural selection. This is known as the "overkill" hypothesis.{{sfn|Barlow et al.|2009|p=2443}} However, recent studies of the molecular history of snake venom have contradicted this, instead finding evidence of rapid adaptive evolution in many different clades, including the carpet vipers, ''[[Echis]]'',{{sfn|Barlow et al.|2009|p=2447}} the ground rattlesnakes, ''[[Sistrurus]]'',{{sfn|Gibbs|Mackessy|2009}} and the [[Malayan pit viper]],{{sfn|Casewell et al.|2013|p=220}} as well as generally in the diversification of PLA2 proteins.{{sfn|Lynch|2007}} There is phylogenetic evidence of positive selection and rapid rates of gene gain and loss in venom genes of ''Sistrurus'' taxa feeding on different prey.{{sfn|Gibbs|Rossiter|2008}} Several studies have found evidence that venom and resistance to venom in prey species have evolved in a [[Evolutionary arms race|coevolutionary arms race]].{{sfn|Barlow et al.|2009|p=2443}} For example, wood rats of the genus ''[[Neotoma]]'' have a high degree of resistance to the venom of rattlesnakes, suggesting that the rats have evolved in response to the snake venom, thus renewing selection pressure upon the snakes.{{sfn|Gibbs|Mackessy|2009}} The selection pressure on snake venom is thought to be selecting for functional diversity within the proteins in venom, both within a given species, and across species.{{sfn|Sanz et al.|2006|pp=2098-2099}} The genes that code for venom proteins in some snake genera have a proportion of [[synonymous mutations]] that is lower than would be expected if venom were evolving through [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|neutral evolutionary processes]]. In addition, snake venom is metabolically costly for a snake to produce, which scientists have suggested as further evidence that a selection pressure exists on snake venom (in this case, to minimize the volume of venom required).{{sfn|Barlow et al.|2009|p=2443}} The use of [[model organism]]s, rather than snakes' natural prey, to study prey toxicity, has been suggested as a reason why the "overkill" hypothesis may have been overemphasized.{{sfn|Casewell et al.|2013|pp=220-221}} However, the pitviper genus ''[[Agkistrodon]]'' has been found to be an exception to this; the composition of venom in ''Agkistrodon'' has been found to be related to the position of the species within the phylogeny, suggesting that those venoms have evolved mostly through neutral processes ([[mutation]] and [[genetic drift]]), and that there may be significant variation in the selection pressure upon various snake venoms.{{sfn|Lomonte et al. (b)|2014|pp=112-114}}

==Functional adaptations==
[[File:Mangrovennachtbaumnatter (Boiga dendrophila).JPG|thumb|right|The Mangrove snake ''Boiga dendrophila'', whose venom is toxic to birds.]]

Snakes use their venom to kill or subdue prey, as well as for other diet-related functions, such as digestion. Current scientific theory suggests that snake venom is not used for defense or for competition between members of the same species, unlike in other taxa. Thus adaptive evolution in snake venom has resulted in several adaptations with respect to these diet-related functions that increase the fitness of the snakes that carry them.{{sfn|Casewell et al.|2013|pp=219-220}}{{sfn|Barlow et al.|2009|p=2443}}{{sfn|Li et al.|2005}}

===Prey-specific venom toxicity===
[[File:Echis carinatus sal.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Echis carinatus]]'', one of the many species of the widespread genus ''Echis''. The toxicity of ''Echis'' venom to scorpions has been found to vary with the proportion of arthropods in the snake's diet.]]

Venom that is toxic only to a certain taxon, or strongly toxic only to a certain taxon, has been found in a number of snakes, suggesting that these venoms have evolved via natural selection to subdue preferred prey species. Examples of this phenomenon have been found in the Mangrove snake ''[[Boiga dendrophila]]'', which has a venom specifically toxic to birds,{{sfn|Casewell et al.|2013|pp=220-221}} as well as in the genera ''Echis'' and ''Sistrurus'', and in sea snakes. However, while several snakes possess venom that is highly toxic to their preferred prey species, the reverse correlation is not necessarily true: the venoms of several snakes are toxic to taxa that they do not consume in high proportions. Most snake venom, for instance, is highly toxic to lizards, although the proportion of lizard prey varies among snake species. This has led researchers to suggest that toxicity to a certain taxon is nearly independent of toxicity to another distantly related taxon.{{sfn|Gibbs|Mackessy|2009}}

[[File:Hydrophis - Brehms.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Hydrophis cyanocinctus]]'', a member of a clade that has a greatly simplified venom that evolved in response to a diet of fish]]

The natural diets of snakes in the widespread [[Viperidae|viper]] genus ''[[Echis]]'' are highly varied, and include [[arthropods]], such as [[scorpion]]s, as well as vertebrates. Various ''Echis'' species consume different quantities of arthropods in their diet.{{sfn|Barlow et al.|2009|pp=2444, 2447}} A study carried out in 2009 injected scorpions with the venom of various ''Echis'' species, and found a high correlation between the proportion of arthropods that the snakes consumed in their natural habitat, and the toxicity of their venom to scorpions.{{sfn|Barlow et al.|2009|p=2447}} The researchers also found evidence that the evolution of venom more toxic to arthropods was related to an increase in the proportion of arthropods in the snakes' diet, and that diet and venom may have evolved by a process of [[coevolution]]. A phylogeny of the genus constructed using [[mitochondrial DNA]] showed that one instance of a change in venom composition in the species ancestral to all ''Echis'' snakes was correlated with a shift to an arthropod based diet, whereas another shift in a more recent lineage was correlated with a shift to a diet of [[vertebrate]]s.{{sfn|Barlow et al.|2009|pp=2446-2448}} Despite the higher toxicity of the venom of arthropod-consuming species, it was not found to incapacitate or kill prey any faster than that of species with fewer arthropods in their diet. Thus, the venom is thought to have evolved to minimize the volume required, as the production of venom carries a significant metabolic cost, thus providing a fitness benefit.{{sfn|Barlow et al.|2009|pp=2446-2448}} This pattern is also found in other lineages.{{sfn|Casewell et al.|2013|pp=223-225}} Similar results were obtained by a 2012 study which found that the venom of arthropod-consuming ''Echis'' species was more toxic to locusts than that of vertebrate-consuming species.{{sfn|Richards et al.|2012}}

A 2009 study of the venom of four ''[[Sistrurus]]'' pit viper species found significant variation in the toxicity to mice.{{sfn|Gibbs|Mackessy|2009}} This variation was related to the proportion of small mammals in the diet of those species.{{sfn|Gibbs|Mackessy|2009}} The idea that ''Sistrurus'' venom had evolved to accommodate a mammal-based diet was supported by phylogenetic analysis. The researchers suggested that the basis for the difference in toxicity was the difference in muscle physiology in the various prey animals.{{sfn|Gibbs|Mackessy|2009}} Two lineages of [[elapid]] snakes, common sea snakes and ''[[Laticauda]]'' sea kraits, have independently colonized marine environments, and shifted to a very simple diet based on [[teleost]]s, or ray-finned fish.{{sfn|Li et al.|2005}} A 2005 study found that both these lineages have a much simpler set of venom proteins than their terrestrial relatives on the [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]], which have a more varied and complex diet.{{sfn|Li et al.|2005}} These findings were confirmed by a 2012 study, which compared the venoms of ''[[Toxicocalamus]] longissimus'', a terrestrial species, and ''[[Hydrophis cyanocinctus]]'', a marine species, both within the subfamily Hydrophiinae (which is also within the Elapid family). Despite being closely related to one another, the marine species had a significantly simpler set of venom proteins.{{sfn|Calvete et al.|2012|pp=4094-4098}} The venoms of the sea snakes are nonetheless among the most toxic venoms known. It has been argued that since sea snakes are typically unable to prevent the escape of bitten prey, their venoms have evolved to act very rapidly.{{sfn|Calvete et al.|2012|pp=4092-4093}}

===Pre-digestion of prey===

|footer = The venom of the prairie rattlesnake, ''[[Crotalus viridis]]'' (left) includes [[metalloproteinase]]s (example on the right) which help digest the prey before the snake eats it. 
}}
The various subspecies of the rattlesnake genus ''[[Crotalus]]'', produce venoms that carry out two conflicting functions. The venom immobilizes prey after a bite, and also helps digestion by breaking down tissues before the snake eats its prey.{{sfn|Mackessy|2010}} As with other members of the family [[Viperidae]], the venoms of ''Crotalus'' disrupt the [[homeostasis|homeostatic processes]] of prey animals. However, there is a wide variety of venom compositions among the species of ''Crotalus''. A 2010 study found a 100-fold difference in the amount of [[metalloproteinase]] activity among the various snakes, with ''[[Crotalus cerberus]]'' having the highest activity and ''[[Crotalus oreganus concolor]]'' having the lowest. There was also a 15-fold variation in the amount of protease activity, with ''C. o. concolor'' and ''C. cerberus'' having the highest and lowest activities, respectively.{{sfn|Mackessy|2010}}

Metalloproteinase activity causes [[hemorrhage]] and [[necrosis]] following a snake bite, a process which aids digestion. The activity of proteases, on the other hand, disrupts [[platelet]] and muscle function and damages [[cell membrane]]s, and thus contributes to a quick death for the prey animal.{{sfn|Mackessy|2010}} The study found that the venoms of ''Crotalus'' fell into two categories; those that favored metalloproteinases (Type I) and those that favored proteases (Type II). The study stated that these functions were essentially mutually exclusive; venoms had been selected for based on either their toxicity or their tenderizing potential. The researchers also hypothesized that the reason for this dichotomy was that a venom high in [[Neurotoxin|neurotoxicity]], such as a type II venom, kills an animal quickly, preventing the relatively slower acting metalloproteinase from digesting tissue.{{sfn|Mackessy|2010}}

===Tracking bitten prey===

| footer    = The western diamondback rattlesnake, ''[[Crotalus atrox]]'' (left), whose venom contains [[disintegrin]]s (right) which allow it to track bitten prey
}}
Another example of an adaptive function other than prey immobilization is the role of [[Viperidae|viperid]] venom in allowing the snake to track a prey animal it has bitten, a process known as "prey relocalization." This important adaptation allowed rattlesnakes to evolve the strike-and-release bite mechanism, which provided a huge benefit to snakes by minimizing contact with potentially dangerous prey animals.{{sfn|Saviola et al.|2013}} However, this adaptation then requires the snake to track down the bitten animal in order to eat it, in an environment full of other animals of the same species. A 2013 study found that western diamondback rattlesnakes (''[[Crotalus atrox]]'') responded more actively to mouse carcasses that had been injected with crude rattlesnake venom. When the various components of the venom were separated out, the snakes responded to mice injected with two kinds of [[disintegrin]]s. The study concluded that these disintegrin proteins were responsible for allowing the snakes to track their prey, by changing the odor of the bitten animal.{{sfn|Saviola et al.|2013}}

==Diet-based atrophication==
[[File:Eierschlange frisst Zwergwachtelei.jpg|thumb|upright|A shift to a diet of eggs has resulted in an atrophied venom system in the common egg-eater ''Dasypeltis scabra'']]

According to the hypothesis that snake venom had a single evolutionary origin, venom in a number of lineages of snakes subsequently atrophied.{{sfn|Fry et al.|2012|pp=434-436}} Evidence of such atrophication has been found in several snakes.{{sfn|Fry et al.|2012|p=443}} A 2005 study in the marbled sea snake, ''[[Aipysurus eydouxii]]'' found that the gene for a [[Calciseptine#Three-fingered toxin family|three-fingered protein]] found in the venom had undergone a deletion of two [[Nucleobase|nucleotide bases]] which made the venom 50-100 times less toxic than it had been previously. This change was correlated with a change in diet from fish to a diet consisting almost entirely of fish eggs, suggesting that the adaptation to an egg diet had removed the [[selection pressure]] needed to maintain a highly toxic venom, allowing the venom genes to accumulate deleterious mutations.{{sfn|Li et al.|2005}}{{sfn|Calvete et al.|2012|pp=4097-4098}} A similar venom degradation following a shift to an egg-based diet has been found in the Common egg-eater ''[[Dasypeltis scabra]]'', whose diet consists entirely of birds' eggs, meaning that the snake had no use for its venom. This has led biologists to suggest that if venom is not used by a species, it is rapidly lost.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcponline.org/content/7/2/215.long&lt;/ref&gt;

Venom atrophication has also occurred following the evolution of [[constriction]] as a method of prey capture that does not require venom. Constriction is hypothesized to have evolved independently in several lineages.{{sfn|Fry et al.|2012|p=443}} North American ‘rat snakes’  such as the Corn snake ''[[Pantherophis guttatus]]'' use constriction to trap and kill their rodent prey, and do not possess functional venom. A similar process has occurred in the African colubrid lineage [[Lamprophiidae]], such as ''[[Pseudaspis cana]]'', as well as in the genus ''[[Acrochordus]]''.{{sfn|Fry et al.|2012|p=443}}

The practice emphasizes morality and the cultivation of virtue, and identifies as a qigong practice of the Buddhist school, though its teachings also incorporate elements drawn from [[Taoist]] traditions. Through moral rectitude and the practice of meditation, practitioners of Falun Gong aspire to eliminate attachments, and ultimately to achieve spiritual enlightenment.

Falun Gong was first taught publicly in Northeast China in 1992 by [[Li Hongzhi]]. It emerged toward the end of China's "''qigong'' boom"—a period that saw a proliferation of similar practices of meditation, slow-moving energy exercises and regulated breathing. It differs from other ''qigong'' schools in its absence of fees or formal membership, lack of daily rituals of worship, its greater emphasis on morality, and the theological nature of its teachings. Western academics have described Falun Gong as a qigong discipline, a "spiritual movement", a "cultivation system" in the tradition of Chinese antiquity, or as a form of Chinese [[religion]].

The practice initially enjoyed support from Chinese officialdom, but by the mid to late 1990s, the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party]] and public security organizations increasingly viewed Falun Gong as a potential threat due to its size, independence from the state, and spiritual teachings. By 1999, government estimates placed the number of Falun Gong practitioners at 70 million.&lt;ref name=Faison/&gt; During that time, negative coverage of Falun Gong began to appear in the state-run press, and practitioners usually responded by picketing the source involved. Most of the time, the practitioners succeeded, but controversy and tension continued to build. The scale of protests grew until April 1999, when over 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners gathered near the central government compound in Beijing to request legal recognition and freedom from state interference. This demonstration is widely seen as catalyzing the persecution that followed.

On 20 July 1999, the Communist Party leadership initiated a nationwide [[Persecution of Falun Gong|crackdown and multifaceted propaganda campaign]] intended to eradicate the practice. It [[Persecution of Falun Gong#Internet censorship|blocked]] Internet access to websites that mention Falun Gong, and in October 1999 it declared Falun Gong a "heretical organization" that threatened social stability.

==Origins==
Falun Gong is most frequently identified with the [[qigong]] movement in China. ''Qigong'' is a modern term that refers to a variety of practices involving slow movement, meditation, and regulated breathing. Qigong-like exercises have historically been practiced by Buddhist monks, Daoist martial artists, and Confucian scholars as a means of spiritual, moral, and physical refinement.

On 13 May 1992, Li Hongzhi gave his first public seminar on Falun Gong (alternatively called Falun Dafa) in the northeastern city of [[Changchun]]. In his [[Hagiography|hagiographic]] spiritual biography, Li Hongzhi is said to have been taught ways of "cultivation practice" by several masters of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Taoism|Daoist]] traditions, including Quan Jue, the 10th Heir to the Great Law of the Buddha School, and a master of the Great Way School with the Taoist alias of ''True Taoist'' from the [[Changbai Mountains]]. Falun Dafa is said to be the result of his reorganizing and writing down the teachings that were passed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Li Hongzhi, [http://media.falundafa.org/media1/media/dafa/eng/mp3/En-1-Lecture.mp3 9-day Lectures in Guangzhou (audio), lecture 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113060130/http://media.falundafa.org/media1/media/dafa/eng/mp3/En-1-Lecture.mp3# |date=13 November 2017 }}, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Li presented Falun Gong as part of a "centuries-old tradition of cultivation",&lt;ref name=Ownbyming&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ownby|first1=David|title=A History for Falun Gong: Popular Religion and the Chinese State Since the Ming Dynasty|journal=Nova Religio|date=2003|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/a-history-for-falun-gong-popular.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150124205431/http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/a-history-for-falun-gong-popular.html|archivedate=24 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in effect sought to revive the religious and spiritual elements of qigong practice that had been discarded in the earlier Communist era. David Palmer writes that Li "redefined his method as having entirely different objectives from qigong: the purpose of practice should neither be physical health nor the development of extraordinary powers, but to purify one's heart and attain spiritual salvation."&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;

Falun Gong is distinct from other qigong schools in that its teachings cover a wide range of spiritual and metaphysical topics, placing emphasis on morality and virtue and elaborating a complete cosmology.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; The practice identifies with the Buddhist School (''Fojia'') but also draws on concepts and language found in Taoism and Confucianism.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; This has led some scholars to label the practice as a [[syncretism|syncretic]] faith.&lt;ref name=irons2003/&gt;

===Central teachings===
[[File:Falun Gong Meditation in Manhattan New York.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.1|Falun Gong adherents practice the fifth exercise, a meditation, in Manhattan]]
Falun Gong aspires to enable the practitioner to ascend spiritually through moral rectitude and the practice of a set of exercises and meditation. The three central tenets of the belief are Truthfulness (真, Zhēn), Compassion (善, Shàn), and Forbearance (忍, Rěn).&lt;ref name=zflprinciples&gt;Li Hongzhi, Zhuan Falun, p 7. Quote: "The most fundamental characteristic of this universe, Zhen-Shan-Ren, is the highest manifestation of the Buddha Fa. It is the most fundamental Buddha Fa."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bwqkwx4SWS0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ownby+falun&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Falun Gong and the Future of China],'' pp 93, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Together these principles are regarded as the fundamental nature of the cosmos, the criteria for differentiating right from wrong, and are held to be the highest manifestations of the [[Tao]], or Buddhist Dharma.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noah Porter, Falun Gong in the United States: An Ethnographic Study, p 29. Quote: "According to the Falun Gong belief system, there are three virtues that are also principles of the universe: Zhen, Shan, and Ren (真, 善, 忍). Zhen is truthfulness and sincerity. Shan is compassion, benevolence, and kindness. Ren is forbearance, tolerance, and endurance. These three virtues are the only criteria that truly distinguish good people and bad people. Human society has deviated from these moral standards. All matter in the universe contains Zhen- Shan-Ren. All three are equally important."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, Falun Gong and the Future of China, p 93. Quote: "The very structure of the universe, according to Li Hongzhi, is made up of the moral qualities that cultivators are enjoined to practice in their own lives: truth, compassion, and forbearance."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 133. Quote: "For Li, as he often repeats in Zhuan Falun, the special characteristic or particular nature of the cosmos is the moral triumvirate of zhen (truth), shan (compassion), and ren (forbearance). He does not mean this metaphorically; for him zhen, shan, and ren are the basic organizing principles of all things&amp;nbsp;... it is embedded in the very essence of everything in the universe that they adhere to the principles of truth, compassion, and forbearance."&lt;/ref&gt; Adherence to and cultivation of these virtues is regarded as a fundamental part of Falun Gong practice.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 124. Quote: "In addition, in Falun Gong cultivation adherence to the code of truth, compassion, and forbearance is not just regarded as the right and responsible course of action for practitioners; it is an essential part of the cultivation process. Lapsing from it will render any other efforts in cultivation worthless."&lt;/ref&gt; In Zhuan Falun (转法轮), the foundational text published in 1995, Li Hongzhi writes "It doesn't matter how mankind's moral standard changes&amp;nbsp;... The nature of the cosmos doesn't change, and it is the only standard for determining who's good and who's bad. So to be a cultivator you have to take the nature of the cosmos as your guide for improving yourself."&lt;ref name=ZF&gt;Li Hongzhi, ''[http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/lecture1.html Zhuan Falun] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020917213525/http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/lecture1.html |date=17 September 2002 }}, (New York, NY: The Universe Publishing Company, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practice of Falun Gong consists of two features: performance of the exercises, and the refinement of one's ''xinxing'' (moral character, temperament). In Falun Gong's central text, Li states that xinxing "includes virtue (which is a type of matter), it includes forbearance, it includes awakening to things, it includes giving up things—giving up all the desires and all the attachments that are found in an ordinary person—and you also have to endure hardship, to name just a few things."&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The elevation of one's moral character is achieved, on the one hand, by aligning one's life with truth, compassion, and tolerance; and on the other, by abandoning desires and "negative thoughts and behaviors, such as greed, profit, lust, desire, killing, fighting, theft, robbery, deception, jealousy, etc."&lt;ref name="Benjamin Penny p 170"&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the central concepts found in the teachings of Falun Gong is the existence of 'Virtue' ('德, ''[[De (Chinese)|Dé]]'') and 'Karma' ('業, ''[[Karma#In Falun Gong|Yè]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, The Religion of Falun Gong, p 172. Quote: "Transforming karma into virtue is fundamental in the cultivation practice of Falun Gong"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownby110&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' pp&amp;nbsp;110–112.&lt;/ref&gt; The former is generated through doing good deeds and suffering, while the latter is accumulated through doing wrong deeds. A person's ratio of karma to virtue is said to determine his or her fortunes in this life or the next. While virtue engenders good fortune and enables spiritual transformation, an accumulation of karma results in suffering, illness, and alienation from the nature of the universe.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownby110/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li Hongzhi, "Zhuan Falun," pp&amp;nbsp;27–35; 362 - 365&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual elevation is achieved through the elimination of negative karma and the accumulation of virtue.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 93. Quote: "The goal of cultivation, and hence of life itself, is spiritual elevation, achieved through eliminating negative karma—the built-up sins of past and present lives—and accumulating virtue."&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners believe that through a process of moral cultivation, one can achieve [[Tao]] and obtain special powers and a level of divinity.&lt;ref name=penny&gt;Penny (2012), p. 158; 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timeint"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dowell |first1=William |title=Interview with Li Hongzhi |url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2053761,00.html |publisher=TIME |accessdate=1 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001083402/http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2053761,00.html# |archive-date=1 October 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falun Gong's teachings posit that human beings are originally and innately good—even divine—but that they descended into a realm of delusion and suffering after developing selfishness and accruing karma.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' pp&amp;nbsp;103–105.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice holds that [[reincarnation]] exists and that different people's reincarnation processes are overseen by different gods. &lt;ref name="ttfatc"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19990626L.html |title=Teaching the Fa at the Conference in the Midwest-U.S. |last=Li |first=Hongzhi |access-date=2 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130051007/http://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19990626L.html# |archive-date=30 November 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To re-ascend and return to the "original, true self," Falun Gong practitioners are supposed to assimilate themselves to the qualities of truthfulness, compassion and tolerance, let go of "attachments and desires" and suffer to repay karma.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 93. Quote: "One finds few lists of do's and don'ts in Li's writings, nor are there sophisticated ethical discussions. Instead, followers are advised to rid themselves of unnecessary "attachments", to do what they know is right, and hence to return to "the origin", to their "original self".&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of the practice is enlightenment or spiritual perfection (''yuanman''), and release from the cycle of reincarnation, known in Buddhist tradition as ''samsara''.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Chinese cultural thought and modernity are two focuses of Li Hongzhi's teachings. Falun Gong echoes traditional Chinese beliefs that humans are connected to the universe through mind and body, and Li seeks to challenge "conventional mentalities", concerning the nature and genesis of the universe, time-space, and the human body.&lt;ref name=Schechter&gt;Danny Schechter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=v20J18hL1MAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Danny+Schechter,+Falun+Gong%27s+Challenge+to+China&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Falun Gong's Challenge to China: Spiritual Practice of 'Evil Cult'?], (New York, NY:[[Akashic Books]], 2000).

===Exercises===
[[File:Five Exercises of Falun Dafa.jpg|thumb|right|The five exercises of Falun Gong]]
In addition to its moral philosophy, Falun Gong consists of four standing exercises and one sitting meditation. The exercises are regarded as secondary to moral elevation, though is still an essential component of Falun Gong cultivation practice.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;&lt;ref name=flgbook&gt;Li Hongzhi, ''[http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/flg.htm Falun Gong] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020913132538/http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/flg.htm |date=13 September 2002 }}'', 4th Translation Edition, Updated April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The first exercises, called "Buddha Stretching a Thousand Arms", are intended to facilitate the free flow of energy through the body and open up the meridians. The second exercise, "Falun Standing Stance", involves holding four static poses—each of which resembles holding a wheel—for an extended period. The objective of this exercise is to "enhances wisdom, increases strength, raises a person's level, and strengthens divine powers". The third, "Penetrating the Cosmic Extremes", involves three sets of movements, which aim to enable the expulsion of bad energy (e.g., pathogenic or black qi) and the absorption of good energy into the body. Through practice of this exercise, the practitioner aspires to cleanse and purify the body. The fourth exercise, "Falun Cosmic Orbit", seeks to circulate energy freely throughout the body. Unlike the first through fourth exercises, the fifth exercise is performed in the seated lotus position. Called "Reinforcing Supernatural Powers", it is a meditation intended to be maintained as long as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Li Hongzhi, Falun Gong (6th Translation Edition, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," pp&amp;nbsp;163–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Falun Gong exercises can be practiced individually or in group settings, and can be performed for varying lengths of time in accordance with the needs and abilities of the individual practitioner.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ownby313"/&gt; Porter writes that practitioners of Falun Gong are encouraged to read Falun Gong books and practice its exercises on a regular basis, preferably daily.&lt;ref name=porterthesis&gt;Noah Porter, "[http://etd.fcla.edu/SF/SFE0000113/FalunGongInTheUS-NoahPorter-Thesis.pdf Falun Gong in the United States: An Ethnographic Study]". University of South Florida, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong exercises are practiced in group settings in parks, university campuses, and other public spaces in over 70 countries worldwide, and are taught for free by volunteers.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Falundafa.org, [http://www.falundafa.org/eng/contacts/area/index.html 'Find your local volunteer contact person'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118225305/http://www.falundafa.org/eng/contacts/area/index.html |date=18 January 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to five exercises, in 2001 another meditation activity was introduced called "sending righteous thoughts," which is intended to reduce persecution on the spiritual plane.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;

A pilot study involving genomic profiling of six Falun Dafa practitioners indicated that, "changes in gene expression of [Falun Gong] practitioners in contrast to normal healthy controls were characterized by enhanced immunity, downregulation of cellular metabolism, and alteration of apoptotic genes in favor of a rapid resolution of inflammation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lili_Feng/publication/7984577_Genomic_profiling_of_neutrophil_transcripts_in_Asian_Qigong_practitioners_a_pilot_study_in_gene_regulation_by_mind-body_interaction/file/d912f50cfe3badd217.pdf Genomic profiling of neutrophil transcripts in Asian Qigong practitioners]: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15750361 a pilot study] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923100618/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15750361# |date=23 September 2017 }} in gene regulation by mind-body interaction.

In addition to the attainment of physical health, many Buddhist and Daoist meditation systems aspire to transform the physical body and cultivate a variety of supernatural capabilities (''shentong''), such as [[telepathy]] and divine sight.&lt;ref&gt;Penny (2012), p. 157-158; 202&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions of supernatural skills also feature prominently within the qigong movement, and the existence of these skills gained a level mainstream acceptance in China’s scientific community in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;  Falun Gong’s teachings hold that practitioners can acquire supernatural skills through a combination of moral cultivation, meditation and exercises. These include—but are not limited to—precognition, clairaudience, telepathy, and divine sight (via the opening of the [[third eye]] or celestial eye). However, Falun Gong stresses that these powers can be developed only as a result of moral practice, and should not be pursued or casually displayed.&lt;ref&gt;Penny (2012), p. 158; 201&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Ownby, Falun Gong teaches that “Pride in one's abilities, or the desire to show off, are marks of dangerous attachments,” and Li warns his followers not to be distracted by the pursuit of such powers.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;

===Social practices===
[[File:Toronto Falun Gong Exercises 9.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Falun Gong adherents practice the third exercise in Toronto.]]Falun Gong differentiates itself from Buddhist monastic traditions in that it places great importance on participation in the secular world. Falun Gong practitioners are required to maintain regular jobs and family lives, to observe the laws of their respective governments, and are instructed not to distance themselves from society. An exception is made for Buddhist monks and nuns, who are permitted to continue a monastic lifestyle while practicing Falun Gong.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noah Porter, Falun Gong in the United States: An Ethnographic Study, p 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its emphasis on ethical behavior, Falun Gong's teachings prescribe a strict personal morality for practitioners. They are expected to act truthfully, do good deeds, and conduct themselves with patience and forbearance when encountering difficulties. For instance, Li stipulates that a practitioner of Falun Gong must "not hit back when attacked, not talk back when insulted."&lt;ref name=Penny102/&gt; In addition, they must "abandon negative thoughts and behaviors," such as greed, deception, jealousy, etc.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Penny102&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," pp 102; 170-181.&lt;/ref&gt;  The teachings contain injunctions against smoking and the consumption of alcohol, as these are considered addictions that are detrimental to health and mental clarity.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownby112/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners of Falun Gong are forbidden to kill living things—including animals for the purpose of obtaining food—though they are not required to adopt a vegetarian diet.&lt;ref name=Penny102/&gt;

In addition to these things, practitioners of Falun Gong must abandon a variety of worldly attachments and desires.&lt;ref name="Benjamin Penny p 170"/&gt; In the course of cultivation practice, the student of Falun Gong aims to relinquish the pursuit of fame, monetary gain, sentimentality, and other entanglements. Li's teachings repeatedly emphasize the emptiness of material pursuits; although practitioners of Falun Gong are not encouraged to leave their jobs or eschew money, they are expected to give up the psychological attachments to these things.&lt;ref name=Ownby112/&gt; Similarly, sexual desire and lust are treated as attachments to be discarded, but Falun Gong students are still generally expected to marry and have families.&lt;ref name=Ownby112&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' pp&amp;nbsp;112–114.&lt;/ref&gt; All sexual relations outside the confines of monogamous, heterosexual marriage are regarded as immoral.&lt;ref name=wildgrass/&gt; Although gays and lesbians may practice Falun Gong, homosexual conduct is said to generate karma, and is therefore viewed as incompatible with the goals of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Falun Dafa Information Center, [http://faluninfo.net/article/654/?cid=23 Misconceptions: "Intolerant"?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612214442/http://faluninfo.net/article/654/?cid=23# |date=12 June 2010 }}, 16 June 2008. Retrieved 27 November 2010. See also Robyn Lebron, "Searching for Spiritual Unity," p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

Falun Gong's cosmology includes the belief that different ethnicities each have a correspondence to their own heavens, and that individuals of mixed race lose some aspect of this connection.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; Nonetheless, Li maintains that being of mixed race does not affect a person's soul, nor hinder their ability to practice cultivation.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; The practice does not have any formal stance against interracial marriage, and many Falun Gong practitioners have interracial children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://faluninfo.net/article/654/?cid=23 |title=FalunInfo.net - Misconceptions: 'Intolerant'? |work=faluninfo.net |year=2011 |quote=practice |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falun Gong doctrine counsels against participation in political or social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive interest in politics is viewed as an attachment to worldly power and influence, and Falun Gong aims for transcendence of such pursuits. According to Hu Ping, "Falun Gong deals only with purifying the individual through exercise, and does not touch on social or national concerns. It has not suggested or even intimated a model for social change. Many religions&amp;nbsp;... pursue social reform to some extent&amp;nbsp;... but there is no such tendency evident in Falun Gong."&lt;ref name=Ping&gt;Hu Ping, "The Falun Gong Phenomenon", in Challenging China: Struggle and Hope in an Era of Change, Sharon Hom and Stacy Mosher (ed) (New York: The New Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texts===
The first book of Falun Gong teachings was published in April 1993. Called ''China Falun Gong'', or simply ''Falun Gong'', it is an introductory text that discusses ''qigong'', Falun Gong's relationship to Buddhism, the principles of cultivation practice and the improvement of moral character (xinxing). The book also provides illustrations and explanations of the exercises and meditation.&lt;ref name=flgbook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," pp&amp;nbsp;93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main body of teachings is articulated in the book ''Zhuan Falun'', published in Chinese in January 1995. The book is divided into nine "lectures", and was based on edited transcriptions of the talks Li gave throughout China in the preceding three years.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong texts have since been translated into an additional 40 languages.&lt;ref&gt;falunfafa.org, [http://www.falundafa.org List of languages] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129120831/http://www.falundafa.org/# |date=29 November 2016 }}, Accessed 11-09-2013&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these central texts, Li has published several books, lectures, articles, books of poetry, which are made available on Falun Gong websites.&lt;ref&gt;See Falundafa.org, [http://www.falundafa.org/eng/books.html "books"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623070050/http://www.falundafa.org/eng/books.html# |date=23 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," pp&amp;nbsp;100–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Falun Gong teachings use numerous untranslated Chinese religious and philosophical terms, and make frequent allusion to characters and incidents in Chinese folk literature and concepts drawn from [[Chinese popular religion]]. This, coupled with the literal translation style of the texts, which imitate the colloquial style of Li's speeches, can make Falun Gong scriptures difficult to approach for Westerners.&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lowe|first1=Scott|title=Chinese and International Contexts for the Rise of Falun Gong|journal=Nova Religio|date=2003|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/chinese-and-international-contexts-for.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150124205404/http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/chinese-and-international-contexts-for.html|archivedate=24 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbols===
The main symbol of the practice is the ''Falun'' (Dharma wheel, or ''[[Dharmacakra]]'' in [[Sanskrit]]). In Buddhism, the Dharmacakra represents the completeness of the doctrine. To "turn the wheel of dharma" (''Zhuan Falun'') means to preach the Buddhist doctrine, and is the title of Falun Gong's main text.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "Falun Gong, Buddhism, and Buddhist qigong," Asian Studies Review 29 (March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the invocation of Buddhist language and symbols, the law wheel as understood in Falun Gong has distinct connotations, and is held to represent the universe.&lt;ref name=Bruseker/&gt; It is conceptualized by an emblem consisting of one large and four small (counter-clockwise) [[Swastika]] symbols, representing the Buddha, and four small [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] (yin-yang) symbols of the Daoist tradition.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruseker&gt;George Bruseker, "Falun Gong: A Modern Chinese Folk Buddhist Movement in Crisis," 26 April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Li situates his teaching of Falun Gong amidst the "Dharma-ending period" (''Mo Fa'', 末法), described in Buddhist scriptures as an age of moral decline when the teachings of Buddhism would need to be rectified.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; The current era is described in Falun Gong's teachings as the "Fa rectification" period (''zhengfa'', which might also be translated as "to correct the dharma"), a time of cosmic transition and renewal.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; The process of Fa rectification is necessitated by the moral decline and degeneration of life in the universe, and in the post-1999 context, the persecution of Falun Gong by the Chinese government has come to be viewed as a tangible symptom of this moral decay.&lt;ref name=burgdoff/&gt; Through the process of the Fa rectification, life will be reordered according to the moral and spiritual quality of each, with good people being saved and ascending to higher spiritual planes, and bad ones being eliminated or cast down.&lt;ref name=burgdoff/&gt; In this paradigm, Li assumes the role of rectifying the Dharma by disseminating through his moral teachings.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;

Some scholars, such as Maria Hsia Chang and Susan Palmer, have described Li's rhetoric about the "Fa rectification" and providing salvation "in the final period of the Last Havoc", as apocalyptic.&lt;ref name=fieldnotes/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chang"/&gt; However, Benjamin Penny argues that Li's teachings are better understood in the context of a "Buddhist notion of the cycle of the Dharma or the Buddhist law".&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;Chris Bullock, [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/falun-gong-cult-or-culture/3481242 ''Falun Gong: Cult or Culture?''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510192427/http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/falun-gong-cult-or-culture/3481242# |date=10 May 2013 }}, National Radio. Retrieved 21 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Gunde notes that unlike apocalyptic groups in the West, Falun Gong does not fixate on death or the end of the world, and instead "has a simple, innocuous ethical message".&lt;ref name=Gunde/&gt; Li Hongzhi does not discuss a "time of reckoning",&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; and has rejected predictions of an impending apocalypse in his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Danny Schechter, "Falun Gong's Challenge to China, p 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categorization==
Falun Gong is a multifaceted discipline that means different things to different people, ranging from a set of physical exercises for the attainment of better health and a praxis of self-transformation, to a [[moral philosophy]] and a new knowledge system.&lt;ref name="zhao"/&gt; Scholars and journalists have adopted a variety of terms and classifications in describing Falun Gong, some of them more precise than others.

In the cultural context of China, Falun Gong is generally described either as a system of qigong, or a type of "cultivation practice" (''xiulian''). Cultivation is a Chinese term that describes the process by which an individual seeks spiritual perfection, often through both physical and moral conditioning. Varieties of cultivation practice are found throughout Chinese history, spanning Buddhist, Daoist and Confucian traditions.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; Benjamin Penny, a professor of Chinese history at the Australian National University, writes "the best way to describe Falun Gong is as a cultivation system. Cultivation systems have been a feature of Chinese life for at least 2,500 years."&lt;ref name="pennyharrold"&gt;Benjamin Penny, [http://www.nla.gov.au/grants/haroldwhite/papers/bpenny.html The Past, Present, and Future of Falun Gong] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325202921/http://www.nla.gov.au/grants/haroldwhite/papers/bpenny.html# |date=25 March 2008 }}, Lecture given at the National Library of Australia, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Qigong practices can also be understood as a part of a broader tradition of "cultivation practice".&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;

In the West, Falun Gong is frequently classified as a religion on the basis of its theological and moral teachings,&lt;ref name=Madsen/&gt; its concerns with spiritual cultivation and transformation, and its extensive body of scripture.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; Human rights groups report on the persecution of Falun Gong as a violation of religious freedom, and in 2001, Falun Gong was given an International Religious Freedom Award from [[Freedom House]].&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; Falun Gong practitioners themselves have sometimes disavowed this classification, however. This rejection reflects the relatively narrow definition of "religion" (''zongjiao'') in contemporary China. According to David Ownby, religion in China has been defined since 1912 to refer to "world-historical faiths" that have "well-developed institutions, clergy, and textual traditions"—namely, Buddhism, Daoism, Islam, Protestantism and Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, [http://www.cecc.gov/pages/roundtables/052305/Ownby.php "Unofficial Religions in China: Beyond the Party's Rules"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326193222/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/roundtables/052305/Ownby.php |date=26 March 2008 }}, Testimony for the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, 23 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong lacks these features, having no temples, rituals of worship, clergy or formal hierarchy. Moreover, if Falun Gong had described itself as a religion in China, it likely would have invited immediate suppression.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; These historical and cultural circumstances notwithstanding, the practice has often been described as a form of Chinese religion.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 226. Quote: "Falun Gong is a new form of Chinese religion, even if its adherents themselves may not recognize it as being religion at all."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is often referred to as such in journalistic literature, Falun Gong does not satisfy the definition of a "sect" or "cult."&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt; A sect is generally defined as a branch or denomination of an established belief system or mainstream church. Although Falun Gong draws on both Buddhist and Daoist ideas and terminology, it claims no direct relationship or lineage connection to these religions.&lt;ref name=Ownbyming/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong,"  p 26. Quote: "[Falun Gong] claims no immediate predecessor in the sense of asserting its position in a lineage of religions. Nonetheless, as will be clear throughout this book, many of the terms Li Hongzhi uses and the ideas that underpin Falun Gong teachings are found in Chinese religions of the past."&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists regard sects as exclusive groups that exist within clearly defined boundaries, with rigorous standards for admission and strict allegiances.&lt;ref name=chan2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shun-ching Chan|first1=Cheris|title=The Falun Gong in China: A Sociological Perspective|journal=The China Quarterly|date=September 2004|volume=179|url=http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/the-falun-gong-in-china-sociological.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150124205438/http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/the-falun-gong-in-china-sociological.html|archivedate=24 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as noted by Noah Porter, Falun Gong does not share these qualities: it does not have clearly defined boundaries, and anyone may practice it.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt; Cheris Shun-ching Chan likewise writes that Falun Gong is "categorically not a sect": its practitioners do not sever ties with secular society, it is "loosely structured with a ﬂuctuating membership and tolerant of other organizations and faiths," and it is more concerned with personal, rather than collective worship.&lt;ref name=chan2004 /&gt;

==Organization==

As a matter of [[doctrine|doctrinal]] significance, Falun Gong is intended to be "formless", having little to no material or formal organization. Practitioners of Falun Gong cannot collect money or charge fees, conduct healings, or teach or interpret doctrine for others.&lt;ref name=Palmer241&gt;David Palmer, "Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China," p&amp;nbsp;241–246&lt;/ref&gt; There are no administrators or officials within the practice, no system of membership, and no churches or physical places of worship.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;&lt;ref name=fieldnotes/&gt;&lt;ref name=porterprof&gt;Noah Porter, "Professional Practitioners and Contact Persons Explicating Special Types of Falun Gong Practitioners", ''Nova Religio'', November 2005, Vol. 9, No. 2, pp 62–83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;{{cite journal| first=James| last=Tong| title=An Organizational Analysis of the Falun Gong: Structure, Communications, Financing| journal=[[The China Quarterly]]| volume=171|date=September 2002| pages=636–660| doi=10.1017/S0009443902000402}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of membership or initiation rituals, Falun Gong practitioners can be anyone who chooses to identify themselves as such.&lt;ref name="Haar"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://website.leidenuniv.nl/~haarbjter/faluntext3.html|title=Evaluation and Further References|last=Haar|first=Barendter|accessdate=21 December 2009|quote=One difference between the Falun Gong and traditional groups is the absence of rituals of daily worship or rites of passage|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216071449/http://website.leidenuniv.nl/~haarbjter/faluntext3.html|archivedate=16 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are free to participate in the practice and follow its teachings as much or as little as they like, and practitioners do not instruct others on what to believe or how to behave.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ping/&gt;&lt;ref name=OwnbyCanada&gt;David Ownby, "Falungong and Canada's China Policy," International Journal, Spring 2001, p 193. Quote:"These people have discovered what is to them the truth of the universe. They have arrived freely at this discovery, and, if they change their mind, they are fee to go on to something else. The Falungong community seems to be supportive but not constraining – aside from the peer pressure that exists in many groups situations; there is no visible power structure to chastise a misbehaving practitioner, nor do practitioners tell one another what to do or what to believe."&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiritual authority is vested exclusively in the teachings of founder Li Hongzhi.&lt;ref name=Palmer241/&gt; But organizationally Falun Gong is decentralized, and  local branches and assistants are afforded no special privileges, authority, or titles. Volunteer "assistants" or "contact persons" do not hold authority over other practitioners, regardless of how long they have practiced Falun Gong.&lt;ref name=Chou/&gt;&lt;ref name=burgdoff&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A Burgdoff|first1=Craig|title=How Falun Gong Practice Undermines Li Hongzhi's Totalistic Rhetoric|journal=Nova Religio|date=2003|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/how-falun-gong-practice-undermines-li.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150124205437/http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/how-falun-gong-practice-undermines-li.html|archivedate=24 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Li's spiritual authority within the practice is absolute, yet the organization of Falun Gong works against totalistic control, and Li does not intervene in the personal lives of practitioners. Falun Gong practitioners have little to no contact with Li, except through the study of his teachings.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=burgdoff/&gt; There is no hierarchy in Falun Gong to enforce orthodoxy, and little or no emphasis is given on dogmatic discipline; the only thing emphasized is the need for strict moral behavior, according to Craig Burgdoff, a professor of religious studies.&lt;ref name=burgdoff/&gt;

To the extent that organization is achieved in Falun Gong, it is accomplished through a global, networked, and largely virtual online community. In particular, electronic communications, email lists and a collection of websites are the primary means of coordinating activities and disseminating Li Hongzhi's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrQV2Wi1RdgC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=Kevin+McDonald,+Global+Movements:+Action+and+Culture,+chapter+7,+‘Healing+Movements,+embodied+subjects’,+Wiley-Blackwell+(2006)&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title=Global movements: action and culture | first=Kevin | last=McDonald | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-4051-1613-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside Mainland China, a network of volunteer 'contact persons', regional Falun Dafa Associations and university clubs exist in approximately 80 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Falundafa.org, [http://www.falundafa.org/eng/contacts/area/index.html 'Local Contacts'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118225305/http://www.falundafa.org/eng/contacts/area/index.html |date=18 January 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Li Hongzhi's teachings are principally spread through the Internet.&lt;ref name=fieldnotes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Bell, Taylor C. Boas, ''Falun Gong and the Internet: Evangelism, Community, and Struggle for Survival'', Nova Religio, April 2003, Vol. 6, No. 2, pp 277–293&lt;/ref&gt; In most mid- to large-sized cities, Falun Gong practitioners organize regular group meditation or study sessions in which they practice Falun Gong exercises and read Li Hongzhi's writings. The exercise and meditation sessions are described as informal groups of practitioners who gather in public parks—usually in the morning—for one to two hours.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=fieldnotes&gt;Susan Palmer and David Ownby, ''Field Notes: Falun Dafa Practitioners: A Preliminary Research Report'', Nova Religio, 2000.4.1.133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Burgdoff, "How Falun Gong Practice Undermines Li Hongzhi's Totalistic Rhetoric," p 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Group study sessions typically take place in the evenings in private residences or university or high school classrooms, and are described by David Ownby as "the closest thing to a regular 'congregational experience'" that Falun Gong offers.&lt;ref name=Ownby313&gt;David Ownby, "Falun Gong in the New World", European Journal of East Asian Studies (2003), pp&amp;nbsp;313–314.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who are too busy, isolated, or who simply prefer solitude may elect to practice privately.&lt;ref name=Ownby313/&gt; When there are expenses to be covered (such as for the rental of facilities for large-scale conferences), costs are borne by self-nominated and relatively affluent individual members of the community.&lt;ref name=Ownby313/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Burgdoff, "How Falun Gong Practice Undermines Li Hongzhi's Totalistic Rhetoric," p 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organization within China===
[[File:Origins-GuangzhouPractice.jpg|right|thumb| Morning Falun Dafa exercises, in [[Guangzhou]].]]

In 1993, the Beijing-based Falun Dafa Research Society was accepted as a branch of the state-run China Qigong Research Society (CQRS), which oversaw the administration of the country's various qigong schools, and sponsored activities and seminars. As per the requirements of the CQRS, Falun Gong was organized into a nationwide network of assistance centers, "main stations", "branches", "guidance stations", and local practice sites, mirroring the structure of the qigong society or even of the Communist Party itself.&lt;ref name=Tong/&gt;&lt;ref name=McDonald&gt;Kevin McDonald, Global Movements: Action and Culture, 'Healing Movements, embodied subjects', (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell, 2006), pp 142 – 164&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong assistants were self-selecting volunteers who taught the exercises, organized events, and disseminated new writings from Li Hongzhi. The Falun Dafa Research Society provided advice to students on meditation techniques, translation services, and coordination for the practice nationwide.&lt;ref name=Tong/&gt;

Following its departure from the CQRS in 1996, Falun Gong came under increased scrutiny from authorities and responded by adopting a more decentralized and loose organizational structure.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt; In 1997, the Falun Dafa Research Society was formally dissolved, along with the regional "main stations."&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, "An Organizational Analysis of the Falun Gong: Structure, Communications, Financing," p 641, The China Quarterly, Volume 171 September 2002 , pp. 636-660&lt;/ref&gt; Yet practitioners continued to organize themselves at local levels, being connected through electronic communications, interpersonal networks and group exercise sites.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tong2009&gt;James Tong, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=PyxCVRB-De8C&amp;pg=PP6&amp;lpg=PP6&amp;dq=james+tong+revenge&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PAXEUO0lAG&amp;sig=Asclwn4AMZASBTPoy1oo-DtsneA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bF-FULFdpPbSAaiUgMAM&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999–2005]" (New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0-19-537728-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Falun Gong sources and Chinese government sources claimed that there were some 1,900 "guidance stations" and 28,263 local Falun Gong exercise sites nationwide by 1999, though they disagree over the extent of vertical coordination among these organizational units.&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, "An Organizational Analysis of the Falun Gong: Structure, Communications, Financing,"  p 642, The China Quarterly, Volume 171 September 2002 , pp. 636-660.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the persecution that began in 1999, Falun Gong was driven underground, the organizational structure grew yet more informal within China, and the internet took precedence as a means of connecting practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Thornton, "Manufacturing Dissent in Transnational China", in Popular Protest in China, Kevin J. O'Brien (ed.), (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the persecution of Falun Gong in 1999, Chinese authorities sought to portray Falun Gong as a hierarchical and well-funded organization. James Tong writes that it was in the government's interest to portray Falun Gong as highly organized in order to justify its repression of the group: "The more organized the Falun Gong could be shown to be, then the more justified the regime's repression in the name of social order was."&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, "An Organizational Analysis of the Falun Gong: Structure, Communications, Financing," p 638, The China Quarterly, The China Quarterly, Volume 171 September 2002 , pp. 636-660.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that Party's claims lacked "both internal and external substantiating evidence", and that despite the arrests and scrutiny, the authorities never "credibly countered Falun Gong rebuttals".&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, "An Organizational Analysis of the Falun Gong: Structure, Communications, Financing," p  657, The China Quarterly, Volume 171 September 2002 , pp. 636-660.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic surveys conducted in China in 1998 found a population that was mostly female and elderly. Of 34,351 Falun Gong practitioners surveyed, 27% were male and 73% female. Only 38% were under 50 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Noah Porter, "Falun Gong in the United States: An Ethnographic Study," p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong attracted a range of other individuals, from young college students to bureaucrats, intellectuals and Party officials.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Kaye, "Travelers Tales," Far Eastern Economic Review, 23 July 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys in China from the 1990s found that between 23–40% of practitioners held university degrees at the college or graduate level—several times higher than the general population.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;

Falun Gong is practiced by tens, and possibly hundreds of thousands outside China,&lt;ref name="David Ownby p 126"/&gt; with the largest communities found in Taiwan and North American cities with large Chinese populations, such as New York and Toronto. Demographic surveys by Palmer and Ownby in these communities found that 90% of practitioners are ethnic Chinese.

According to Richard Madsen{{who?|reason=Who is Richard Madsen? Is he notable? And why is it important to mention his name?|date=September 2018}}, Chinese scientists with doctorates from prestigious American universities who practice Falun Gong claim that modern physics (for example, superstring theory) and biology (specifically the [[pineal gland]]'s function) provide a scientific basis for their beliefs. From their point of view, "Falun Dafa is knowledge rather than religion, a new form of science rather than faith".&lt;ref name=Madsen&gt;Richard Madsen, "Understanding Falun Gong," Current History (September 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|History of Falun Gong}}

===1992–1996===
Li Hongzhi introduced Falun Gong to the public on 13 May 1992, in Changchun, [[Jilin]] Province.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; Several months later, in September 1992, Falun Gong was admitted as a branch of qigong under the administration of the state-run China Qigong Scientific Research Society (CQRS). Li was recognized as a qigong master, and was authorized to teach his practice nationwide.&lt;ref name="Ownby (2003)"&gt;David Ownby, "The Falun Gong in the New World". European Journal of East Asian Studies, Sep 2003, Vol. 2 Issue 2, p 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many ''qigong'' masters at the time, Li toured major cities in China from 1992 to 1994 to teach the practice. He was granted a number of awards by PRC governmental organizations.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;&lt;ref name="pennyharrold"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zfl&gt;[http://www.trinity.edu/rnadeau/Chinese%20Religions/Li%20Hongzhi.htm A Short Biography of Mr. Li Hongzhi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041128133954/http://www.trinity.edu/rnadeau/Chinese%20Religions/Li%20Hongzhi.htm# |date=28 November 2004 }}, PRC law and Government v. 32 no. 6 (November/December 1999) p.&amp;nbsp;14–23 {{ISSN|0009-4609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeng, Jennifer. "Witnessing history: one Chinese woman's fight for freedom," Soho Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Ownby, Professor of History and Director of the Center for East Asian Studies at the Université de Montréal, Li became an "instant star of the qigong movement",&lt;ref name="Ownbyworld"&gt;David Ownby, "The Falun Gong in the New World". European Journal of East Asian Studies, Sep2003, Vol. 2 Issue 2, p 306&lt;/ref&gt; and Falun Gong was embraced by the government as an effective means of lowering health care costs, promoting Chinese culture, and improving public morality. In December 1992, for instance, Li and several Falun Gong students participated in the Asian Health Expo in Beijing, where he reportedly "received the most praise [of any qigong school] at the fair, and achieved very good therapeutic results", according to the fair's organizer.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; The event helped cement Li's popularity, and journalistic reports of Falun Gong's healing powers spread.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; In 1993, a publication of the Ministry of Public Security praised Li for "promoting the traditional crime-fighting virtues of the Chinese people, in safeguarding social order and security, and in promoting rectitude in society."&lt;ref&gt;Falun Dafa Information Center, [http://faluninfo.net/topic/24/ "Falun Gong: Timeline"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227024612/http://faluninfo.net/topic/24/# |date=27 December 2008 }}, 18 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Falun Gong had differentiated itself from other ''qigong'' groups in its emphasis on morality, low cost, and health benefits. It rapidly spread via word-of-mouth, attracting a wide range of practitioners from all walks of life, including numerous members of the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;&lt;ref name=lum&gt;Thomas Lum, [http://www.usembassy.it/pdf/other/RL33437.pdf Congressional Research Report #RL33437] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205064042/http://www.usembassy.it/pdf/other/RL33437.pdf |date=5 February 2012 }}, Congressional Research Service, 11 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1992 to 1994, Li did charge fees for the seminars he was giving across China, though the fees were considerably lower than those of competing qigong practices, and the local qigong associations received a substantial share.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt; Li justified the fees as being necessary to cover travel costs and other expenses, and on some occasions, he donated the money earned to charitable causes. In 1994, Li ceased charging fees altogether, thereafter stipulating that Falun Gong must always be taught for free, and its teachings made available without charge (including online).&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some observers believe Li continued to earn substantial income through the sale of Falun Gong books,&lt;ref&gt;Dai Qing: Members of Falungong in an Autocratic Society. Asia Quarterly, Volume IV, No.3, Summer 2000 {{cite web |url=http://asiaquarterly.com/2006/01/28/ii-45/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402115951/http://asiaquarterly.com/2006/01/28/ii-45/ |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; others dispute this, noting that most Falun Gong books in circulation were bootleg copies.&lt;ref name=wildgrass/&gt;

[[File:92@93OrtHealthExpoAward4.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|At the Asian Health Expo in Beijing, 1994, Li Hongzhi is proclaimed the "Most Acclaimed Qigong Master." Falun Gong also received the "Special Gold Award" and award for "Advancing Frontier Science."]]
With the publication of the books ''Falun Gong'' and ''[[Teachings of Falun Gong#Zhuan Falun, the Main Book of Falun Gong|Zhuan Falun]]'', Li made his teachings more widely accessible. ''Zhuan Falun'', published in January 1995 at an unveiling ceremony held in the auditorium of the Ministry of Public Security, became a best-seller in China.&lt;ref&gt;Danny Schechter, "Falun Gong's Challenge to China: Spiritual Practice or Evil Cult?," p 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Chinese authorities began looking to Falun Gong to solidify its organizational structure and ties to the party-state.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt; Li was approached by the Chinese National Sports Committee, Ministry of Public Health, and China Qigong Science Research Association (CQRS) to jointly establish a Falun Gong association. Li declined the offer. The same year, the CQRS issued a new regulation mandating that all qigong denominations establish a Communist Party branch. Li again refused.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;

Tensions continued to mount between Li and the CQRS in 1996. In the face of Falun Gong's rise in popularity—a large part of which was attributed to its low cost—competing ''qigong'' masters accused Li of undercutting them. According to Schechter, the ''qigong'' society under which Li and other ''qigong'' masters belonged asked Li to hike his tuition, but Li emphasized the need for the teachings to be free of charge.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt;

In March 1996, in response to mounting disagreements, Falun Gong withdrew from the CQRS, after which time it operated outside the official sanction of the state. Falun Gong representatives attempted to register with other government entities, but were rebuffed.&lt;ref&gt;David Palmer, "Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China," p 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Li and Falun Gong were then outside the circuit of personal relations and financial exchanges through which masters and their ''qigong'' organizations could find a place within the state system, and also the protections this afforded.&lt;ref&gt;David Palmer, "Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China," p 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996–1999===
Falun Gong's departure from the state-run CQRS corresponded to a wider shift in the government's attitudes towards qigong practices. As qigong's detractors in government grew more influential, authorities began attempting to rein in the growth and influence of these groups, some of which had amassed tens of millions of followers.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; In the mid-1990s the state-run media began publishing articles critical of qigong.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;

Falun Gong was initially shielded from the mounting criticism, but following its withdrawal from the CQRS in March 1996, it lost this protection. On 17 June 1996, the ''Guangming Daily'', an influential state-run newspaper, published a polemic against Falun Gong in which its central text, ''Zhuan Falun'', was described as an example of "feudal superstition."&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer249&gt;David Palmer, "Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China," p 249.&lt;/ref&gt; The author wrote that the history of humanity is a "struggle between science and superstition," and called on Chinese publishers not to print "pseudo-scientific books of the swindlers." The article was followed by at least twenty more in newspapers nationwide. Soon after, on 24 July, the Central Propaganda Department banned all publication of Falun Gong books (though the ban was not consistently enforced).&lt;ref name=Palmer249/&gt; The state-administered Buddhist Association of China also began issuing criticisms of Falun Gong, urging lay Buddhists not to take up the practice.&lt;ref&gt;David Palmer, "Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China," p 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

The events were an important challenge to Falun Gong, and one that practitioners did not take lightly.&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Falun Gong followers wrote to ''Guangming Daily'' and to the CQRS to complain against the measures, claiming that they violated [[Hu Yaobang]]'s 1982 'Triple No' directive, which prohibited the media from either encouraging or criticizing qigong practices.&lt;ref name=Palmer249/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sumner B. Twiss, "Religious Intolerance in Contemporary China, Including the Curious Case of Falun Gong," The World's Religions After 11 September, by Arvind Sharma (ed.) (Greenwood Publishing, 2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;227–240.&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances, Falun Gong practitioners staged peaceful demonstrations outside media or local government offices to request retractions of perceived unfair coverage.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;

The polemics against Falun Gong were part of a larger movement opposing qigong organizations in the state-run media.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Falun Gong was not the only target of the media criticism, nor the only group to protest, theirs was the most mobilized and steadfast response.&lt;ref name="zhao"/&gt; Many of Falun Gong's protests against negative media portrayals were successful, resulting in the retraction of several newspaper stories critical of the practice. This contributed to practitioners' belief that the media claims against them were false or exaggerated, and that their stance was justified.&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1998, [[He Zuoxiu]], an outspoken critic of qigong and a fierce defender of Marxism, appeared on a talk show on [[Beijing Television]] and openly disparaged ''qigong'' groups, making particular mention of Falun Gong.&lt;ref&gt;David Palmer, "Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China," pp 134 &amp; pp&amp;nbsp;252–256&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong practitioners responded with peaceful protests and by lobbying the station for a retraction. The reporter responsible for the program was reportedly fired, and a program favorable to Falun Gong was aired several days later.&lt;ref name="Jude Howell"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H80YZqSj7EEC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Governance+in+China+~+Jude+Howell#v=onepage&amp;q= |work=Governance in China |editor= Jude Howell |first=Clemens Stubbe |last=Østergaard |pages=214–223 |title=Governance and the Political Challenge of Falun Gong |year=2003 |isbn=0-7425-1988-0 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |location=Lanham, Md.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dangerous&gt;{{Cite book|last=Human Right Watch|author2=Mickey Spiegel|title=Dangerous meditation: China's campaign against Falungong|location=New York|year=2001|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong practitioners also mounted demonstrations at 14 other media outlets.&lt;ref name="Jude Howell" /&gt;

In 1997, The Ministry of Public Security launched an investigation into whether Falun Gong should be deemed xie jiao (邪教, "heretical teaching"). The report concluded that "no evidence has appeared thus far".&lt;ref&gt;David Palmer, "Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China," p 265.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, however, on 21 July 1998, the Ministry of Public Security issued Document No. 555, "Notice of the Investigation of Falun Gong". The document asserted that Falun Gong is a "heretical teaching", and mandated that another investigation be launched to seek evidence in support of the conclusion.&lt;ref name=Palmer267/&gt; Falun Gong practitioners reported having phone lines tapped, homes ransacked and raided, and Falun Gong exercise sites disrupted by public security agents.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;

[[File:1999Chi Master Procshort.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Li Hongzhi (right) receiving a proclamation from the [[Governor of Illinois]] in 1999]]
In this time period, even as criticism of qigong and Falun Gong mounted in some circles, the practice maintained a number of high-profile supporters in the government. In 1998, [[Qiao Shi]], the recently retired [[Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]], initiated his own investigation into Falun Gong. After months of investigations, his group concluded that "Falun Gong has hundreds of benefits for the Chinese people and China, and does not have one single bad effect."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, "The Religion of Falun Gong," p 56.&lt;/ref&gt; In May of the same year, China's National Sports Commission launched its own survey of Falun Gong. Based on interviews with over 12,000 Falun Gong practitioners in [[Guangdong]] province,&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; they stated that they were "convinced the exercises and effects of Falun Gong are excellent. It has done an extraordinary amount to improve society's stability and ethics."

The practice's founder, Li Hongzhi, was largely absent from the country during the period of rising tensions with the government. In  March 1995, Li had left China to first teach his practice in France and then other countries, and in 1998 obtained permanent residency in the United States.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;&lt;ref name="GallagherAshcraft2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eugene V.

By 1999, estimates provided by the State Sports Commission suggested there were 70 million Falun Gong practitioners in China.&lt;ref name=Faison/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renee Schoff, "Growing group poses a dilemma for China", Associated Press, 26 April 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous employee of China's National Sports Commission, was at this time quoted in an interview with U.S. News &amp; World Report as speculating that if 100 million had taken up Falun Gong and other forms of qigong there would be a dramatic reduction of health care costs and that "Premier Zhu Rongji is very happy about that."&lt;ref name=BayFang/&gt;

===Tianjin and Zhongnanhai protests===
By the late 1990s, the Communist Party's relationship to the growing Falun Gong movement had become increasingly tense. Reports of discrimination and surveillance by the Public Security Bureau were escalating, and Falun Gong practitioners were routinely organizing sit-in demonstrations responding to media articles they deemed to be unfair. The conflicting investigations launched by the Ministry of the Public Security on one side and the State Sports Commission and Qiao Shi on the other spoke of the disagreements among China's elites on how to regard the growing practice.

In April 1999, an article critical of Falun Gong was published in [[Tianjin Normal University]]'s ''Youth Reader'' magazine. The article was authored by physicist He Zuoxiu who, as Porter and Gutmann note, is a relative of Politburo member and public security [[Party secretary|secretary]] [[Luo Gan]].&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=gutmannfuyou/&gt; The article cast qigong, and Falun Gong in particular, as superstitious and harmful for youth.&lt;ref name=hezuoxiu&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnfxj.org/Html/lgxd/2007-6/24/165513641.html#|title=I do not agree with Youth Practicing ''Qigong'' (我不赞成青少年炼气功)|author=He Zuoxiu|language=Chinese|year=1999|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714235247/http://www.cnfxj.org/Html/lgxd/2007-6/24/165513641.html|archivedate=14 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong practitioners responded by picketing the offices of the newspaper requesting a retraction of the article.&lt;ref name=Palmer267&gt;David Palmer, "Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China," p 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike past instances in which Falun Gong protests were successful, on 22 April the Tianjin demonstration was broken up by the arrival of three hundred riot police. Some of the practitioners were beaten, and forty-five arrested.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer267/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownby171&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 171&lt;/ref&gt; Other Falun Gong practitioners were told that if they wished to appeal further, they needed to take the issue up with the Ministry of Public Security and go to Beijing to appeal.&lt;ref name=gutmannfuyou&gt;[[Ethan Gutmann]] (20 July 2009) [http://www.david-kilgour.com/2009/Jul_05_2009_04.php "An Occurrence on Fuyou Street"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604114413/http://www.david-kilgour.com/2009/Jul_05_2009_04.php# |date=4 June 2013 }}, National Review david-kilgour.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownby171/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danny Schechter, "Falun Gong's Challenge to China," p 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:25April1999Zhongnanhai.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Falun Gong adherents demonstrate in front of Zhongnanhai, 25 April 1999.]]
The Falun Gong community quickly mobilized a response, and on the morning of 25 April, upwards of 10,000 practitioners gathered near the central appeals office to demand an end to the escalating harassment against the movement, and request the release of the Tianjin practitioners. According to Benjamin Penny, practitioners sought redress from the leadership of the country by going to them and, "albeit very quietly and politely, making it clear that they would not be treated so shabbily."&lt;ref name="pennyharrold" /&gt; Journalist [[Ethan Gutmann]] wrote that security officers had been expecting them, and corralled the practitioners onto Fuyou Street in front of Zhongnanhai government compound.&lt;ref name=gutmannfuyou/&gt; They sat or read quietly on the sidewalks surrounding the Zhongnanhai.&lt;ref name=Tong5&gt;James Tong, "Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999–2005," p 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five Falun Gong representatives met with Premier [[Zhu Rongji]] and other senior officials to negotiate a resolution. The Falun Gong representatives were assured that the regime supported physical exercises for health improvements and did not consider the Falun Gong to be anti-government.&lt;ref name=Tong5/&gt; Upon reaching this resolution, the crowd of Falun Gong protesters dispersed.&lt;ref name=gutmannfuyou/&gt;

[[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|Party General Secretary]] [[Jiang Zemin]] was alerted to the demonstration by [[CPC Politburo]] member Luo Gan,&lt;ref name=Zong/&gt; and was reportedly angered by the audacity of the demonstration—the largest since the Tiananmen Square protests ten years earlier. Jiang called for resolute action to suppress the group,&lt;ref name=Tong2009/&gt; and reportedly criticized Premier Zhu for being "too soft" in his handling of the situation.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt; That evening, Jiang composed a letter indicating his desire to see Falun Gong "defeated". In the letter, Jiang expressed concerns over the size and popularity of Falun Gong, and in particular about the large number of senior Communist Party members found among Falun Gong practitioners. He noted the possibility of foreign forces behind Falun Gong's protests (the practice's founder, Li Hongzhi, had emigrated to the United States), and expressed concern about their use of the internet to coordinate a large-scale demonstration. Jiang also intimated that Falun Gong's moral philosophy was at odds with the [[Marxist–Leninist atheism|atheist values of Marxist–Leninism]], and therefore constituted a form of ideological competition.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang Zemin, Letter to Party cadres on the evening of 25 April 1999. Published in Beijing Zhichun no. 97 (June 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jiang is held by Falun Gong to be personally responsible for this decision to persecute Falun Gong.&lt;ref name=peerman&gt;Dean Peerman, [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090628140710/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_16_121/ai_n8702386/pg_4 China syndrome: the persecution of Falun Gong], Christian Century, 10 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Saich&gt;Tony Saich, ''Governance and Politics in China,'' Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition (27 February 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Peerman cited reasons such as suspected personal jealousy of Li Hongzhi; Saich points to Jiang's anger at Falun Gong's widespread appeal, and ideological struggle as causes for the crackdown that followed.

The ensuing campaign aimed to "eradicate" the group through a combination of propaganda, imprisonment, and coercive thought reform of practitioners, sometimes resulting in deaths.

===Speculation on rationale===
Foreign observers have attempted to explain the Party's rationale for banning Falun Gong as stemming from a variety of factors. These include Falun Gong's popularity, China's history of quasi-religious movements that turned into violent insurrections, its independence from the state and refusal to toe the party line, internal power politics within the Communist Party—and Falun Gong's moral and spiritual content, which put it at odds with aspects of the official [[Marxism|Marxist ideology]].

[[File:610 Office.jpg|thumb|right|610 Office's organization in China.]]
Xinhua News Agency, the official news organization of the Communist Party, declared that Falun Gong is "opposed to the Communist Party of China and the central government, preaches idealism, theism and feudal superstition."&lt;ref name="english.peopledaily.com.cn"&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/199908/02/enc_19990802001003_TopNews.html Xinhua Commentary on Political Nature of Falun Gong] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110040730/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/199908/02/enc_19990802001003_TopNews.html# |date=10 January 2008 }}, People's Daily, 2 August 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Xinhua also asserted that "the so-called 'truth, kindness and forbearance' principle preached by [Falun Gong] has nothing in common with the socialist ethical and cultural progress we are striving to achieve", and argued that it was necessary to crush Falun Gong to preserve the "vanguard role and purity" of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name=hanson1999&gt;Gayle M.B.

Willy Wo-Lap Lam writes that Jiang Zemin's campaign against Falun Gong may have been used to promote allegiance to himself; Lam quotes one party veteran as saying "by unleashing a Mao-style movement [against Falun Gong], Jiang is forcing senior cadres to pledge allegiance to his line."&lt;ref&gt;Willy Wo-Lap Lam, "China's sect suppression carries a high price".

Yuezhi Zhao points to several other factors that may have led to a deterioration of the relationship between Falun Gong and the Chinese state and media.&lt;ref name="zhao" /&gt; These included infighting within China's qigong establishment, the influence of qigong opponents among Communist Party leaders, and the struggles from mid-1996 to mid-1999 between Falun Gong and the Chinese power elite over the status and treatment of the movement.&lt;ref name="zhao" /&gt; According to Zhao, Falun Gong practitioners have established a "resistance identity"—one that stands against prevailing pursuits of wealth, power, scientific rationality, and "the entire value system associated with China's project of modernization."&lt;ref name="zhao"/&gt; In China the practice represented an indigenous spiritual and moral tradition, a cultural revitalization movement, and drew a sharp contrast to "Marxism with Chinese characteristics".&lt;ref name="twiss"&gt;Twiss, Sumner B.

[[Vivienne Shue]] similarly writes that Falun Gong presented a comprehensive challenge to the Communist Party's legitimacy. Shue argues that Chinese rulers historically have derived their legitimacy from a claim to possess an exclusive connection to the "Truth". In imperial China, truth was based on a [[Confucian]] and Daoist cosmology, where in the case of the Communist Party, the truth is represented by Marxist–Leninism and historical materialism. Falun Gong challenged the Marxist–Leninism paradigm, reviving an understanding based on more traditionally Buddhist or Daoist conceptions.&lt;ref name=Shue&gt;Vivienne Shue, "Legitimacy Crisis in China?" In Peter Hays Gries and Stanley Rosen (eds.), State and Society in 21st-century China. Crisis, Contention, and Legitimation, New York: RoutledgeCurzon, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; David Ownby contends that Falun Gong also challenged the Communist Party's hegemony over Chinese nationalist discourse: "[Falun Gong's] evocation of a different vision of Chinese tradition and its contemporary value is now so threatening to the state and party because it denies them the sole right to define the meaning of Chinese nationalism, and perhaps of Chineseness."&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby (15 February 2001)  [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/15/opinion/china-s-war-against-itself.html China's War Against Itself] New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Chang noted that since the overthrow of the Qin Dynasty, "Millenarian movements had exerted a profound impact on the course of Chinese history," cumulating in the Chinese Revolutions of 1949, which brought the Chinese Communists to power.&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;Chang, Maria Hsia (2004) ''Falun Gong: The End of Days'' (New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press) {{ISBN|0-300-10227-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patsy Rahn (2002) describes a paradigm of conflict between Chinese sectarian groups and the rulers they often challenge. According to Rahn, the history of this paradigm goes back to the collapse of the Han dynasty: "The pattern of ruling power keeping a watchful eye on sectarian groups, at times threatened by them, at times raising campaigns against them, began as early as the second century and continued throughout the dynastic period, through the Mao era and into the present."&lt;ref name="Rahn2002"&gt;Rahn, Patsy (2002) [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/tpv/2002/00000014/00000004/art00004 "The Chemistry of a Conflict: The Chinese Government and the Falun Gong"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025151245/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/tpv/2002/00000014/00000004/art00004# |date=25 October 2012 }} in ''Terrorism and Political Violence'', Winter, 2002, Vol 14, No. 4 (London: Frank Cass Publishers)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversion program===
[[File:FalunDafa Burn tanyongjie.jpg|thumb|left|Falun Gong practitioner Tang Yongjie was tortured by prison guards, who applied hot rods to his legs in an attempt to force him to recant his beliefs.]] 
According to James Tong, the regime aimed at both coercive dissolution of the Falun Gong denomination and "transformation" of the practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, "Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999–2005," p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, the Party upped its campaign by sentencing "recidivist" practitioners to "[[re-education through labor]]", in an effort to have them renounce their beliefs and "transform" their thoughts.&lt;ref name=Dangerous/&gt; Terms were also arbitrarily extended by police, while some practitioners had ambiguous charges levied against them, such as "disrupting social order", "endangering national security", or "subverting the socialist system".&lt;ref name=bejesky&gt;Robert Bejesky, "Falun Gong &amp; reeducation through labor", ''Columbia Journal of Asian Law'', 17:2, Spring 2004, pp. 147–89&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bejesky, the majority of long-term Falun Gong detainees are processed administratively through this system instead of the criminal justice system. Upon completion of their re-education sentences, those practitioners who refused to recant were then incarcerated in "legal education centers" set up by provincial authorities to "transform minds".&lt;ref name="bejesky"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CECC2009&gt;Congressional Executive Commission on China Annual Report 2006, p. 59; note 224, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the conversion program relied on Mao-style techniques of indoctrination and [[Thought reform in the People's Republic of China|thought reform]], where Falun Gong practitioners were organized to view anti-Falun Gong television programs and enroll in Marxism and materialism study sessions.&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, "Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999–2005," p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Marxism and materialism were the core content of the sessions.&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, "Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999–2005," p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government-sponsored image of the conversion process emphasizes psychological persuasion and a variety of "soft-sell" techniques; this is the "ideal norm" in regime reports, according to Tong. Falun Gong reports, on the other hand, depict "disturbing and sinister" forms of coercion against practitioners who fail to renounce their beliefs.&lt;ref name=tong122-128&gt;James Tong, "Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999–2005," pp.&amp;nbsp;122–28.&lt;/ref&gt; 14,474 cases are classified by different methods of torture, according to Tong (Falun Gong agencies document over 63,000 individual cases of torture).&lt;ref&gt;Falun Dafa Information Center, [http://www.faluninfo.net/topic/3/ Persecution FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127075250/http://www.faluninfo.net/topic/3/# |date=27 November 2010 }}.

The cases appear verifiable, and the great majority identify (1) the individual practitioner, often with age, occupation, and residence; (2) the time and location that the alleged abuse took place, down to the level of the district, township, village, and often the specific jail institution; and (3) the names and ranks of the alleged perpetrators. Many such reports include lists of the names of witnesses and descriptions of injuries, Tong says.&lt;ref name=tong122-128/&gt; The publication of "persistent abusive, often brutal behavior by named individuals with their official title, place, and time of torture" suggests that there is no official will to cease and desist such activities.&lt;ref name=tong122-128/&gt;

===Deaths===
Due to the difficulty in corroborating reports of torture deaths in China, estimates on the number of Falun Gong practitioners killed under persecution vary widely. In 2009, the New York Times reported that, according to human rights groups, the repressions had claimed "at least 2,000" lives.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

===Organ harvesting===
{{Further|Organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China|Organ transplantation in China}}

In 2006, allegations emerged that a large number of Falun Gong practitioners had been killed to supply China's organ transplant industry. These allegations prompted an investigation by former Canadian Secretary of State [[David Kilgour]] and human rights lawyer [[David Matas]].

The [[Kilgour-Matas report]]&lt;ref name=orgharv/&gt;&lt;ref name=theage060708&gt;Reuters, AP (8 July 2006) [http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/falun-gong-organ-claim-supported/2006/07/07/1152240489760.html "Falun Gong organ claim supported"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531070407/http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/falun-gong-organ-claim-supported/2006/07/07/1152240489760.html# |date=31 May 2014 }}, ''The Age'', (Australia)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ottawa&gt;Endemann, Kirstin (6 July 2006) CanWest News Service; ''Ottawa Citizen'' [http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=290fed94-d0c2-4265-8686-54ce75d08eca&amp;k=34245 "Ottawa urged to stop Canadians travelling to China for transplants"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017095219/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=290fed94-d0c2-4265-8686-54ce75d08eca&amp;k=34245 |date=17 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in July 2006, and concluded that "the government of China and its agencies in numerous parts of the country, in particular hospitals but also detention centers and 'people's courts', since 1999 have put to death a large but unknown number of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience." The report, which was based mainly on circumstantial evidence, called attention to the extremely short wait times for organs in China—one to two weeks for a liver compared with 32.5 months in Canada—noting that this was indicative of organs being procured on demand. It also tracked a significant increase in the number of annual organ transplants in China beginning in 1999, corresponding with the onset of the persecution of Falun Gong. Despite very low levels of voluntary organ donation, China performs the second-highest number of transplants per year.

===Media campaign===
The Chinese government's campaign against Falun Gong was driven by large-scale propaganda through television, newspapers, radio and internet.&lt;ref name=Tong2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leung" /&gt;  
Within the first month of the crackdown, 300–400 articles attacking Falun Gong appeared in each of the main state-run papers, while primetime television replayed alleged exposés on the group, with no divergent views aired in the media.&lt;ref name="lemish"&gt;Leeshai Lemish, [http://www.cesnur.org/2009/slc_lemish.htm "Media and New Religious Movements: The Case of Falun Gong"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418053706/http://www.cesnur.org/2009/slc_lemish.htm# |date=18 April 2015 }}, A paper presented at The 2009 CESNUR Conference, Salt Lake City, Utah, 11–13 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The propaganda campaign focused on allegations that Falun Gong jeopardized social stability, was deceiving and dangerous, was "anti-science" and threatened progress, and argued that Falun Gong's moral philosophy was incompatible with a Marxist social ethic.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;

China scholars Daniel Wright and Joseph Fewsmith asserted that for several months after Falun Gong was outlawed, China Central Television's evening news contained little but anti-Falun Gong rhetoric; the government operation was "a study in all-out demonization", they wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Fewsmith, Joseph and Daniel B. Wright. "The promise of the Revolution: stories of fulfilment and struggle in China", 2003, Rowman and Littlefield. p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong was compared to "a rat crossing the street that everyone shouts out to squash" by ''Beijing Daily'';&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "'Enemies of people' warned", 23 January 2001&lt;/ref&gt; other officials said it would be a "long-term, complex and serious" struggle to "eradicate" Falun Gong.&lt;ref&gt;Plafker, Ted. "Falun Gong Stays Locked In Struggle With Beijing," The Washington Post, 26 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

State propaganda initially used the appeal of scientific rationalism to argue that Falun Gong's worldview was in "complete opposition to science" and communism.&lt;ref name=Lu2004&gt;Lu, Xing, ''Rhetoric of the Chinese Cultural Revolution: the impact on Chinese thought, culture, and communication,'' University of South Carolina Press (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''People's Daily'' asserted on 27 July 1999, that the fight against Falun Gong "was a struggle between theism and atheism, superstition and science, idealism and materialism." Other editorials declared that Falun Gong's "idealism and theism" are "absolutely contradictory to the
fundamental theories and principles of Marxism," and that the "'truth, kindness and forbearance' principle preached by [Falun Gong] has nothing in common with the socialist ethical and cultural progress we are striving to achieve." Suppressing Falun Gong was presented as a necessary step to maintaining the "vanguard role" of the Communist Party in Chinese society.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Chiung Hwang. "Framing Falun Gong: Xinhua News Agency's Coverage of the New Religious Movement in China", Asian Journal of Communication, Vol. 15 No. 1 (2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;16–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Party efforts, initial charges leveled against Falun Gong failed to elicit widespread popular support for the persecution of the group. In the months following July 1999, the rhetoric in the state-run press escalated to include charges that Falun Gong was colluding with foreign, "anti-China" forces. In October 1999, three months after the persecution began, the [[People Daily]] newspaper claimed Falun Gong as a ''xiejiao''.&lt;ref name=irons2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Irons|first1=Edward|title=Falun Gong and the Sectarian Religion Paradigm|journal=Nova Religio|date=2003|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/falun-gong-and-sectarian-religion.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150124205340/http://www.omnilogos.com/2014/12/falun-gong-and-sectarian-religion.html|archivedate=24 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chan2004 /&gt; A direct translation of that term is "heretical teaching", but during the anti-Falun Gong propaganda campaign was rendered as "evil [[cult]]" in English.&lt;ref name=Amnesty&gt;Amnesty International (23 March 2000) [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa17/011/2000/en/ The crackdown on Falun Gong and other so-called 'heretical organizations'] &lt;/ref&gt; In the context of imperial China, the term "xiejiao" was used to refer to non-Confucian religions, though in the context of Communist China, it has been used to target religious organizations that do not submit to Communist Party authority.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Hsia Chang, "Falun Gong:The End of Days," (Yale University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freedom House, [http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/Analysis_of_China_Docs_1_to_7.pdf "Report Analyzing Seven Secret Chinese Government Documents"] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/62n1StDL3?url=http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/Analysis_of_China_Docs_1_to_7.pdf |date=29 October 2011 }}, 11 February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Denis Johnson|Ian Johnson]] argued that applying the 'cult' label to Falun Gong effectively "cloaked the government's crackdown with the legitimacy of the West's anticult movement."  He notes, however, that Falun Gong does not satisfy common definitions of a cult: "its members marry outside the group, have outside friends, hold normal jobs, do not live isolated from society, do not believe that the world's end is imminent and do not give significant amounts of money to the organisation&amp;nbsp;... it does not advocate violence and is at heart an apolitical, inward-oriented discipline, one aimed at cleansing oneself spiritually and improving one's health."&lt;ref name="wildgrass"/&gt; David Ownby similarly wrote that "the entire issue of the supposed cultic nature of Falun Gong was a red herring from the beginning, cleverly exploited by the Chinese state to blunt the appeal of Falun Gong.".&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture /&gt; According to John Powers and Meg Y. M. Lee, because the Falun Gong was categorized in the popular perception as an "apolitical, qigong exercise club," it was not seen as a threat to the government. The most critical strategy in the Falun Gong suppression campaign, therefore, was to convince people to reclassify the Falun Gong into a number of "negatively charged religious labels",&lt;ref name=powerslee&gt;Powers, John and Meg Y. M. Lee. "Dueling Media: Symbolic Conflict in China's Falun Gong Suppression Campaign" in Chinese Conflict Management and Resolution, by Guo-Ming Chen and Ringo Ma (2001), Greenwood Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt; like "evil cult", "sect", or "superstition". The group's silent protests were reclassified as creating "social disturbances". In this process of relabelling, the government was attempting to tap into a "deep reservoir of negative feelings related to the historical role of quasi-religious cults as a destabilising force in Chinese political history."&lt;ref name=powerslee/&gt;

A turning point in the propaganda campaign came on the eve of [[Chinese New Year]] on 23 January 2001, when [[Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident|five people attempted to set themselves ablaze]] on Tiananmen Square. The official Chinese press agency, [[Xinhua News Agency]], and other state media asserted that the [[Self-immolation|self-immolators]] were practitioners, though the Falun Dafa Information Center disputed this,&lt;ref name="FDI_PressRelease"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clearwisdom.net/eng/2001/jan/23/vsf012301_3.html |title=Press Statement |publisher=Clearwisdom |date=23 January 2001 |accessdate=9 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310213800/http://www.clearwisdom.net/eng/2001/jan/23/vsf012301_3.html# |archive-date=10 March 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that the movement's teachings explicitly forbid suicide and killing,&lt;ref name="TheIssueOfKilling"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://falundafa.org/book/eng/zfl_new_7.html#1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030621185758/http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zfl_new_7.html#1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-06-21 |title=The Issue of Killing |first=Hongzhi |last=Li |work=[[Zhuan Falun]] |publisher=Falun Dafa }}&lt;/ref&gt; further alleging that the event was "a cruel (but clever) piece of stunt-work."&lt;ref name=brady08&gt;[[Anne-Marie Brady]], Marketing dictatorship: propaganda and thought work in contemporary China, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The incident received international news coverage, and video footage of the burnings were broadcast later inside China by [[China Central Television]] (CCTV).

IED's statement at the 53rd UN session describes China's violent assault on Falun Gong practitioners as state terrorism and that the self-immolation "was staged by the government." ''Washington Post'' journalist Phillip Pan wrote that the two self-immolators who died were not actually Falun Gong practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Pan, Philip P. (5 February 2001). "One-Way Trip to the End in Beijing". International Herald Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 21, 2001, Liu Siying suddenly died after appearing very lively and being deemed ready to leave the hospital to go home. ''Time'' reported that prior to the self-immolation incident, many Chinese had felt that Falun Gong posed no real threat, and that the state's crackdown had gone too far. After the event, however, the mainland Chinese media campaign against Falun Gong gained significant traction.&lt;ref name=breakingpoint&gt;Matthew Gornet, [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,165163,00.html "The Breaking "] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013111614/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,165163,00.html# |date=13 October 2007 }}, ''Time'', 25 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt; As public sympathy for Falun Gong declined, the government began sanctioning "systematic use of violence" against the group.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Pan and John Pomfret, "Torture is Breaking Falun Gong". Washington Post, 5 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, 2001, the month following the Tiananmen Square incident, Jiang Zemin convened a rare Central Work Conference to stress the importance of continuity in the anti-Falun Gong campaign and unite senior party officials behind the effort.&lt;ref name=Dangerous/&gt; Under Jiang's leadership, the crackdown on Falun Gong became part of the Chinese political ethos of "upholding stability" – much the same rhetoric employed by the party during [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|Tiananmen in 1989]]. Jiang's message was echoed at the 2001 National People's Congress, where the Falun Gong's eradication was tied to China's economic progress.&lt;ref name=Dangerous/&gt; Though less prominent on the national agenda, the persecution of Falun Gong has carried on after Jiang was retired; successive, high-level "strike hard" campaigns against Falun Gong were initiated in both 2008 and 2009. In 2010, a three-year campaign was launched to renew attempts at the coercive "transformation" of Falun Gong practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Executive Commission on China, [http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/index.phpd?showsingle=154369&amp;PHPSESSID=5fbbb671b469039d4ec2ae47774039bd "Communist Party Calls for Increased Efforts To "Transform" Falun Gong Practitioners as Part of Three-Year Campaign"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622035126/http://cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/index.phpd?showsingle=154369&amp;PHPSESSID=bb43fa72510b8818664943d558abc3a0# |date=22 June 2011 }}, 22 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In education system====
Anti-Falun Gong propaganda efforts have also permeated the Chinese education system. Following Jiang Zemin's 1999 ban of Falun Gong, then-Minister of Education Chen Zhili launched an active campaign to promote the Party's line on Falun Gong within all levels of academic institutions, including graduate schools, universities and colleges, middle schools, primary schools, and kindergartens. Her efforts included a "Cultural Revolution-like pledge" in Chinese schools that required faculty members, staff, and students to publicly denounce Falun Gong. Teachers who did not comply with Chen's program were dismissed or detained; uncooperative students were refused academic advancement, expelled from school, or sent to "transformation" camps to alter their thinking.&lt;ref name="specialtribunal.org"&gt;[http://www.specialtribunal.org/downloads/WOIPFG_MinistryOfEducation_Part1.pdf "Chinese Ministry of Education Participating in Persecution of Falun Gong: Investigative Report"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040927053846/http://www.specialtribunal.org/downloads/WOIPFG_MinistryOfEducation_Part1.pdf# |date=27 September 2004 }}. 16 March 2004. Retrieved 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Chen also worked to spread the anti-Falun Gong academic propaganda movement overseas, using domestic educational funding to donate aid to foreign institutions, encouraging them to oppose Falun Gong.&lt;ref name="specialtribunal.org"/&gt;

===Falun Gong's response to the persecution===
[[File:Protesting the Persecution of Falun Gong in Washington DC.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Practitioners meditate to protest the persecution of Falun Gong at a demonstration in Washington, DC.]]
Falun Gong's response to the persecution in China began in July 1999 with appeals to local, provincial, and central petitioning offices in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Rosenthal and Erik Eckholm, "Vast Numbers of Sect Members Keep Pressure on Beijing" New York Times, 28 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; It soon progressed to larger demonstrations, with hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners traveling daily to Tiananmen Square to perform Falun Gong exercises or raise banners in defense of the practice. These demonstrations were invariably broken up by security forces, and the practitioners involved were arrested—sometimes violently—and detained. By 25 April 2000, a total of more than 30,000 practitioners had been arrested on the square;&lt;ref name="johnson2000"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6464 |title=Defiant Falun Dafa Members Converge on Tiananmen |first=Ian |last=Johnson |date=25 April 2000 |work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Pulitzer.org |page=A21 |access-date=10 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229022658/http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6464# |archive-date=29 December 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; seven hundred Falun Gong followers were arrested during a demonstration in the square on 1 January 2001.&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Elizabeth J. |last=Selden |author2=Perry, Mark |title=Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |isbn=0-415-30170-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public protests continued well into 2001. Writing for the ''Wall Street Journal'', Ian Johnson wrote that "Falun Gong faithful have mustered what is arguably the most sustained challenge to authority in 50 years of Communist rule."&lt;ref name=DE&gt;Ian Johnson, [http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6463 "A Deadly Exercise: Practicing Falun Gong was a right, Ms. Chen said, to her last day"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008043846/http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6463# |date=8 October 2009 }}, Wall Street Journal, 20 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 2001, demonstrations in Tiananmen Square had become less frequent, and the practice was driven deeper underground. As public protest fell out of favor, practitioners established underground "material sites," which would produce literature and DVDs to counter the portrayal of Falun Gong in the official media. Practitioners then distribute these materials, often door-to-door.&lt;ref&gt;Liao Yiwu. "The Corpse Walker: Real Life Stories: China from the Bottom Up." p 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong sources estimated in 2009 that over 200,000 such sites exist across China today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faluninfo.net/article/1041/Falun-Gong-Beliefs-and-Demographics-/ "2010 Annual Report: Falun Gong Beliefs and Demography of Practitioners"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103172615/http://www.faluninfo.net/article/1041/Falun-Gong-Beliefs-and-Demographics-/# |date=3 January 2015 }} Falun Dafa Information Center, 26 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The production, possession, or distribution of these materials is frequently grounds for security agents to incarcerate or sentence Falun Gong practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Executive Commission on China [http://www.cecc.gov/publications/annual-reports/2009-annual-report 2009 Annual Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225023828/http://www.cecc.gov/publications/annual-reports/2009-annual-report# |date=25 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Falun Gong activists in China tapped into television broadcasts, replacing regular state-run programming with their own content. One of the more notable instances occurred in March 2002, when Falun Gong practitioners in [[Changchun]] intercepted eight cable television networks in Jilin Province, and for nearly an hour, televised a program titled "Self-Immolation or a Staged Act?". All six of the Falun Gong practitioners involved were captured over the next few months.

Outside China, Falun Gong practitioners established international media organizations to gain wider exposure for their cause and challenge narratives of the Chinese state-run media. These include [[The Epoch Times]] newspaper, [[NTDTV|New Tang Dynasty Television]], and [[Sound of Hope]] radio station.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; According to Zhao, through ''The Epoch Times'' it can be discerned how Falun Gong is building a "de facto media alliance" with China's democracy movements in exile, as demonstrated by its frequent printing of articles by prominent overseas Chinese critics of the PRC government.&lt;ref name="zhao"/&gt; In 2004, ''The Epoch Times'' published a collection of nine editorials that presented a critical history of Communist Party rule.&lt;ref name=Ping/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steel, Kevin.

''The Epoch Times'' claims that tens of millions have renounced the Communist Party as part of the movement, though these numbers have not been independently verified.&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, Ethan.

Li Hongzhi began teaching Falun Gong internationally in March 1995. His first stop was in Paris where, at the invitation of the Chinese ambassador, he held a lecture seminar at the PRC embassy. This was followed by lectures in Sweden in May 1995. Between 1995 and 1999, Li gave lectures in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Switzerland, and Singapore.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;

Falun Gong's growth outside China largely corresponded to the migration of students from Mainland China to the West in the early- to mid-1990s. Falun Gong associations and clubs began appearing in Europe, North America and Australia, with activities centered mainly on university campuses.&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;Noah Porter (Master's Thesis for the University of South Florida).

Translations of Falun Gong teachings began appearing in the late 1990s. As the practice began proliferating outside China, Li Hongzhi was beginning to receive recognition in the United States and elsewhere in the western world. In May 1999, Li was welcomed to [[Toronto]] with greetings from the [[Mayor of Toronto|city's mayor]] and the provincial [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario|lieutenant governor]], and in the two months that followed also received recognition from the cities of  [[Chicago]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Cheris Shun-ching (2004). "The Falun Gong in China: A Sociological Perspective". ''The China Quarterly'', 179 , pp. 665–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the practice was beginning to attract an overseas constituency in the 1990s, it remained relatively unknown outside China until the Spring of 1999, when tensions between Falun Gong and [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] authorities became a subject of international media coverage.  With the increased attention, the practice gained a greater following outside China.  Following the launch of the Communist Party's suppression campaign against Falun Gong, the overseas presence became vital to the practice's resistance in China and its continued survival.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; Falun Gong practitioners overseas have responded to the persecution in China through regular demonstrations, parades, and through the creation of media outlets, performing arts companies, and censorship-circumvention software mainly intended to reach Mainland Chinese audiences.&lt;ref name="Beiser, Vince 2010"/&gt;

Most of these have been created by social scientists, who investigate the social conditions that lead to the creation of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, Yanfei. "The Religion of Falun Gong."

Since 1999, numerous Western governments and human rights organizations have expressed condemnation of the Chinese government's suppression of Falun Gong.&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1999, members of the United States Congress have made public pronouncements and introduced several resolutions in support of Falun Gong.&lt;ref name="CRS2006"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/67820.pdf |title=CRS Report for Congress: China and Falun Gong |publisher=Congressional Research Service |author=Thomas Lum |date=25 May 2006 |format=PDF |access-date=25 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904105343/https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/67820.pdf# |archive-date=4 September 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, U.S. House of Representatives Resolution 605 called for "an immediate end to the campaign to persecute, intimidate, imprison, and torture Falun Gong practitioners," condemned the Chinese authorities' efforts to distribute "false propaganda" about the practice worldwide, and expressed sympathy to persecuted Falun Gong practitioners and their families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hres605eh/pdf/BILLS-111hres605eh.pdf United States House Resolution 605] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305194905/http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hres605eh/pdf/BILLS-111hres605eh.pdf# |date=5 March 2016 }}, United States Government Printing Office, 17 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einhorn, Bruce, (17 March 2010).

From 1999 to 2001, Western media reports on Falun Gong—and in particular, the mistreatment of practitioners—were frequent, if mixed.&lt;ref name="lemish"/&gt; By the latter half of 2001, however, the volume of media reports declined precipitously, and by 2002, major news organizations like the ''New York Times'' and ''Washington Post'' had almost completely ceased their coverage of Falun Gong from China.&lt;ref name="lemish"/&gt; In a study of media discourse on Falun Gong, researcher Leeshai Lemish found that Western news organizations also became less balanced, and more likely to uncritically present the narratives of the Communist Party, rather than those of Falun Gong or human rights groups.&lt;ref name="lemish"/&gt; Adam Frank writes that in reporting on the Falun Gong, the Western tradition of casting the Chinese as "exotic" took dominance, and that while the facts were generally correct in Western media coverage, "the normalcy that millions of Chinese practitioners associated with the practice had all but disappeared."&lt;ref&gt;Frank 2004, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; David Ownby noted that alongside these tactics, the "cult" label applied to Falun Gong by the Chinese authorities never entirely went away in the minds of some Westerners, and the stigma still plays a role in wary public perceptions of Falun Gong.&lt;ref&gt;Ownby (2000), p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

To counter the support of Falun Gong in the West, the Chinese government expanded their efforts against the group internationally. This included visits to newspaper officers by diplomats to "extol the virtues of Communist China and the evils of Falun Gong",&lt;ref name=jte&gt;Turley-Ewart, John, "[http://www.ansleyandcompany.com/NationalPost-PersecutionToCanada0627-2001.html Falun Gong persecution spreads to Canada: Ottawa does little] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704140258/http://www.ansleyandcompany.com/NationalPost-PersecutionToCanada0627-2001.html# |date=4 July 2012 }}", National Post, 20 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; linking support for Falun Gong with "jeopardizing trade relations," and sending letters to local politicians telling them to withdraw support for the practice.&lt;ref name=jte/&gt; According to [[Perry Link]], pressure on Western institutions also takes more subtle forms, including academic self-censorship, whereby research on Falun Gong could result in a denial of visa for fieldwork in China; or exclusion and discrimination from business and community groups who have connections with China and fear angering the Communist Party.&lt;ref name=jte/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry Link, ''[http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/2599.html The Anaconda in the Chandelier: Chinese censorship today] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106003311/http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/2599.html# |date=6 November 2016 }}, 27 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the persecution of Falun Gong has drawn considerable condemnation outside China, some observers note that Falun Gong has failed to attract the level of sympathy and sustained attention afforded to other Chinese dissident groups.&lt;ref name=gutmann_carrytorch/&gt; [[Katrina Lantos Swett]], vice chair of the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]], notes that most Americans are aware of the suppression of "Tibetan Buddhists and unregistered Christian groups or pro-democracy and free speech advocates such as Liu Xiaobo and Ai Weiwei," and yet "know little to nothing about China’s assault on the Falun Gong."&lt;ref&gt;Katrina Lantos Swett and Mary Ann Glendon, [http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/23/u-s-should-press-china-over-falun-gong/ 'U.S. should press China over Falun Gong'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912065305/http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/23/u-s-should-press-china-over-falun-gong/# |date=12 September 2016 }}, CNN, 23 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethan Gutmann]], a journalist reporting on China since the early 1990s, has attempted to explain this apparent dearth of public sympathy for Falun Gong as stemming, in part, from the group's shortcomings in public relations. Unlike the democracy activists or Tibetans, who have found a comfortable place in Western perceptions, "Falun Gong marched to a distinctly Chinese drum", Gutmann writes. Moreover, practitioners' attempts at getting their message across carried some of the uncouthness of Communist party culture, including a perception that practitioners tended to exaggerate, create "torture tableaux straight out of a Cultural Revolution opera", or "spout slogans rather than facts". This is coupled with a general doubtfulness in the West of persecuted refugees.&lt;ref name=gutmann&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/824qbcjr.asp|title=China's Gruesome Organ Harvest.

Richard Madsen writes that Falun Gong lacks robust backing from the American constituencies that usually support religious freedom. For instance, Falun Gong's conservative moral beliefs have alienated some liberal constituencies in the West (e.g. its teachings against promiscuity and homosexual behavior).&lt;ref name=wildgrass/&gt; Christian conservatives, by contrast, don't accord the practice the same space{{clarify|date=January 2018}} as persecuted Chinese Christians.&lt;ref name=Madsen247&gt;Richard Madsen, "Understanding Falun Gong," p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Madsen charges that the American political center does not want to push the human rights issue so hard that it would disrupt commercial and political relations with China.

'''George Molnar''' (1934 – 1999) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born [[philosopher]] whose principal area of interest was [[metaphysics]]. He worked mainly at the [[Philosophy]] Department at the [[University of Sydney]] but resided in [[England]] in 1976–1982. He published four philosophical papers in two separate spells; the first two in the 1960s and the second two after a return to the profession in the 1990s. His book ''[[Powers: A Study in Metaphysics]]'' was published posthumously in 2003.

==Early life==
Molnar's parents were [[middle-class]] [[Jews]] resident in [[Budapest]]. They became separated before [[World War II]] and George was in the care of his mother during pre-war upheavals and persecutions, the [[Siege of Budapest]] and progression through various refugee camps until 1951 when the family was reunited in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=varga/&gt; He studied economics at Sydney University and switched to philosophy in his final year, under the realist philosopher [[John Anderson (philosopher)|John Anderson]].&lt;ref name=varga/&gt; He was later to be appointed as John Anderson Senior Research Fellow&lt;ref&gt;Cole C. "[http://www.alumni.sydney.edu.au/s/965/images/editor_documents/alumni-magazine/09-winter/sam-winter09-philosophy.pdf A difficult legacy]" Article on Anderson in ''Sydney Alumni Magazine'' (SAM), Winter 2009, p. 34 (fol. 32)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In the 1950s and 1960s he was a prominent member of the university's Libertarian Society and associate of the [[Sydney Push]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. J. Baker (philosopher)|Baker A. J.]] [http://www.takver.com/history/aia/aia00026.htm Sydney Libertarianism and the Push]&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers and libertarians who frequented the racecourse knew Molnar as a fervid gambler. His other interests included [[philately]] and early Australian colonial history (particularly the railways systems). At various times he was a taxi-driver, tram-conductor, union advocate and public servant.&lt;ref name=varga/&gt;

In the 1970s Molnar was active in philosophy department disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Franklin (philosopher)|Franklin J.]] [http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/sydq.html The Sydney Philosophy Disturbances] in ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'' v.43 (4) (Apr, 1999), pp 16-21&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from Sydney University in 1976 and moved to the UK where he is said to have participated in the left-wing [[Big Flame (political group)|Big Flame]] think-tank.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In 1982 he returned to Sydney, joined the Department of Veterans Affairs and became active in the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association (ACOA),{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} later returning to Sydney University as a part-time tutor.

An infrequent but influential [[publisher]] of [[Article (publishing)|articles]] and material, Molnar was working on a book at the time of his death. He was in email contact with [[Stephen Mumford#"Powers: A Study in Metaphysics" (ed. 2003)|Stephen Mumford]] at the [[University of Nottingham]], who acted as archivist of his work, edited the book and saw it through to publication in 2003 under the title ''Powers: A Study in Metaphysics'',&lt;ref name=varga&gt;Varga S. [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/08/1060145848387.html Twice the man], ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' 9 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; with a foreword by [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]]. Its publisher, [[Oxford University Press]], wrote "This is contemporary metaphysics of the highest quality".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199204175.do Powers: A Study in Metaphysics] at Oxford University Press, 30 November 2006.

A '''half-truth''' is a [[deception|deceptive statement]] that includes some element of [[truth]]. The statement might be partly true, the statement may be totally true but only part of the whole truth, or it may use some deceptive element, such as improper [[punctuation]], or [[double meaning]], especially if the intent is to deceive, [[Evasion (ethics)|evade]], [[blame]] or misrepresent the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Half-truth |title=Merriam Webster Definition of Half-truth, August 1, 2007 |publisher=M-w.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The purpose and or consequence of a half-truth is to make something that is really only a [[belief]] appear to be [[knowledge]], or a truthful statement to represent the whole truth, or possibly lead to a false conclusion. According to the [[Justified true belief#Justified true belief|justified true belief]] theory of knowledge, in order to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe in the relevant true proposition, but one must also have a good reason for doing so. A half-truth deceives the recipient by presenting something believable and using those aspects of the statement that can be shown to be true as good reason to believe the statement is true in its entirety, or that the statement represents the whole truth. A person deceived by a half-truth considers the proposition to be knowledge and acts accordingly.

==Examples==
* In January 2018, U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] claimed on Twitter that "because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!" Although the unemployment rate for black Americans was indeed at a record low, the rate had been consistently decreasing since 2010, six years before Trump took office.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-partly-correct-rejoinder-jay-z/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Using a [[technicality]]: Former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] famously engaged in a half-truth when he gave the testimony of "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky." Here he engaged in an [[equivocation]] fallacy to deliberately indicate one particular meaning of the phrase "sexual relations", while intending another meaning, in order to deliberately mislead the court while still being able to later claim that "my statements were technically correct."{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
*"You should not trust Peter with your children. I once saw him smack a child with his open hand." ''In this example the statement could be true, but Peter may have slapped the child on the back because he was choking.''
*"I'm a really good driver. In the past thirty years, I have gotten only four speeding tickets"* ''This statement is true, but irrelevant if the speaker started driving a week ago.''
*After being stopped for [[drunk driving]], the inebriated driver proclaims "I only had a couple of [[beer]]s" in slurred speech. ''The driver may have also consumed alcoholic drinks other than beer, and the "beers" may have been large bottles as opposed to the usual contents of a normal-sized can, bottle, or glass''
*The classic story about [[blind men and an elephant]]. Each blind man touches a different part of the elephant and reaches a different conclusion about the nature of the elephant; while each man's experience of the elephant is accurate, none of them have a full understanding of the nature of the beast. One may be touching the tail and believe that the elephant is long and thin, another may be touching the belly and say that it is round and big.
*"False dichotomy": the formal fallacy of false dilemma, also known as [[False dilemma|false choice, falsified dilemma]], fallacy of the excluded middle, [[black and white thinking]], false correlative, either/or fallacy, and bifurcation—involves a situation in which two alternative statements are held to be the only possible options, when in reality there exist one or more other options which have not been considered or presented to the listeners.

==Politics==
Some forms of half-truths are an inescapable part of politics in [[representative democracy|representative democracies]]. The reputation of a political candidate can be irreparably damaged if they are exposed in a lie, so a complex style of language has evolved to minimise the chance of this happening. If someone has not said something, they cannot be accused of lying. As a consequence, politics has become a world where half-truths are expected, and political statements are rarely accepted at face value.&lt;ref name="htpolitics"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language|author=Crystal, David|authorlink=David Crystal|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Safire]] defines a half-truth, for political purposes, as "a statement accurate enough to require an explanation; and the longer the explanation, the more likely a public reaction of half-belief".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Language of Politics: An Anecdotal Dictionary of Catchwords, Slogans, and Political Usage|author=[[William Safire]]|year=1968|publisher=[[Random House]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1990 work ''The Magic Lantern: The Revolution of 1989 Witnessed in Warsaw, Budapest, Berlin, and Prague'', [[Timothy Garton Ash]] responded to [[Václav Havel]]'s call for "living in truth":
{{cquote|Now we expect many things of politicians in a well-functioning parliamentary democracy. But "living in truth" is not one of them. In fact the essence of democratic politics might rather be described as "working in half-truth". Parliamentary democracy is, at its heart, a system of limited adversarial mendacity, in which each party attempts to present part of the truth as if it were the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] was quoted as saying: "There are no whole truths; all truths are half-truths. It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the devil".&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Dialogues'', 1954: Prologue.&lt;/ref&gt; If this is true, statements, or truths, which according to Whitehead are all half-truths, are susceptible to creating deceptive and false conclusions.

==Meme theory==

[[Richard Brodie (programmer)|Richard Brodie]] links half-truths to [[meme]]s "the truth of any proposition depends on the assumptions you make in considering it—the distinct memes you use in thinking about it".&lt;ref name="brodie"&gt;{{cite book|title=Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Meme|author=Brodie, Richard|year=1996|publisher=Integral Press, Seattle|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brodie considers half-truths a necessary part of human interaction because they allow practical application of ideas when it is impractical to convey all the information needed to make a fully informed decision, although some half-truths can lead to a false conclusions or [[inferences]] in the world of [[logic]].

==Quotations==
The notion of half-truths has existed in various cultures, giving rise to several [[epigram]]matic sayings.

*[[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], an Austrian journalist, critic, playwright, and poet noted, "An [[aphorism]] can never be the whole truth; it is either a half-truth or a truth-and-a-half."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in [[Thomas Szasz]], ''Anti-Freud: Karl Kraus's Criticism of Psychoanalysis and Psychiatry'', 1990, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Arthur Koestler]] "Two half-truths do not make a truth, and two half-cultures do not make a culture."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in [[Jonathon Green]], ''Says who?: a guide to the quotations of the century'', 1988, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3674">'''Henry Aristippus''' of [[Calabria]] (born in [[Santa Severina]] in 1105–10; died in [[Palermo]] in 1162), sometimes known as '''Enericus''' or '''Henricus Aristippus''', was a religious scholar and the [[archdeacon]] of [[Catania]] (from [[Circa|c.]] 1155) and later chief ''familiaris'' (or [[chancellor]]) of the [[triumvirate]] of ''familiares'' who replaced the [[admiral]] [[Maio of Bari]] as chief functionaries of the [[kingdom of Sicily]] in 1161.&lt;!-- According to the chronicler [[Hugo Falcandus]], he was:

:''mansuetissimi virum ingenii et tam latinis quam grecis litteris eruditum, familiarem sibi delegit ut vicem et officium interim gereret admirati, preessetque notariis, et cum co secretius de regni negotiis pertractaret''.--&gt;

While the historian of Norman Sicily, [[John Julius Norwich]], believes him to have probably been of [[Normans|Norman]] extraction despite his [[Greek language|Greek]] surname, Donald Matthew considers it self-evident, based on both his name and occupations, that he was Greek. He was first and foremost a scholar and, even if Greek, he was an adherent of the Latin church.

Aristippus was an envoy to [[Constantinople]] (1158-1160) when he received from the emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus]] a Greek copy of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Matthew, ''The Norman kingdom of Sicily'', (Cambridge University Press, 1992), 118.&lt;/ref&gt; A student of the [[Schola Medica Salernitana]] tracked down Aristippus and his copy on [[Mount Etna]] (observing an eruption) and proceeded to give a [[Latin language|Latin]] translation. Though this was the first translation of the ''Almagest'' into Latin, it was not as influential as a later translation into Latin made by [[Gerard of Cremona]] from the Arabic. The original manuscript is probably in the [[Biblioteca Marciana]] in [[Venice]].

Aristippus himself produced the first Latin translation of [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'' (1160) and ''[[Meno]]'' and the fourth book of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Meteorologica]]''. He also translated [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] at the request of [[William I of Sicily]].

In 1161, William appointed three ''familiares''&amp;mdash;Aristippus, [[Sylvester of Marsico]], and the [[Bishop Palmer]]&amp;mdash;to replace the assassinated Maio. In 1162, Aristippus was suspected of disloyalty by the king and imprisoned. He died probably soon after in that very year. He may have helped himself to some of the royal concubines during the rebellion of 1161. He does not seem to have been a particularly effective administrator. Sylvester of Marsico died at the same time and [[Matthew of Ajello]] and the [[caïd Peter]] replaced him and Aristippus in the "triumvirate."

'''Herman of Carinthia''' (c. 1100 – c. 1160), also nicknamed ''Hermannus Dalmata'' ("the Dalmatian"), ''Sclavus'' ("the Slav") or ''Secundus'' ("the Second"), was an [[Istria]]n [[philosopher]], [[astronomer]], [[astrologer]], [[mathematician]], [[translator]] and author.

Among [[Adelard of Bath]], [[John of Seville]], [[Gerard of Cremona]] (1114–1187) and [[Plato of Tivoli]] (1134–1145) Herman is the most important translator of Arabic astronomical works in 12th century and populariser of Arabic culture in Europe. The influence of his translations on the development of medieval European astronomy was especially large.

==Life==
In his own account he was born in "central [[Istria]]" circa 1100, then part of the [[Duchy of Carinthia]]. He died circa 1160.

Most likely he went to a [[Benedictine]] monastic school in Istria. He went on to study in France. It was probably in France that Herman's attention was drawn to the classical texts which were becoming available via Arabic sources. This was before the time of the first university in France, but at [[Chartres]] he attended one of the cathedral schools which were the predecessors of universities and he also studied in Paris in the 1130s.
The teachers at Chartres included [[Thierry of Chartres]] to whom Herman was to dedicate a translation in 1143.  The [[school of Chartres]] was known for its interests in Christian platonism and the natural sciences.

One of Herman's fellow students in France was [[Robert of Ketton]] with whom he travelled for four years in the Eastern Mediterranean.  Both men became translators from the Arabic. At [[Constantinople]] and [[Damascus]] Herman took note of the Arabic science of that period. Circa 1138 he returned to Europe, and was active as a scholar in Spain (an important country for translations from the Arabic) and southern France. A huge part of his work remained anonymous.

==Translation of Qur'an and other Islamic works==
In 1142 Herman was in Spain and became involved in an important project to translate Islamic texts.
[[Peter the Venerable]] recruited a team, including Herman, to translate five texts about [[Islam]] into Latin.  Different members of the team appear to have concentrated on different works, and Herman is credited as the main translator of two of them: ''De generatione Muhamet et nutritura eius'' and ''Doctrina Muhamet''.

The most significant translation in the collection was that of the [[Qur'an]].  This was entitled [[Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete]] and was the first known translation of the Qur'an into a European language. Robert of Ketton was its principal translator, according to most sources (including the ''Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete'' itself). However, Herman may have had some input, given the team nature of the project.
Despite being an imperfect translation, ''Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete'' remained the standard one for centuries, circulating in manuscript before being printed in the 1543 edition published in [[Basel]] by [[Theodor Bibliander]]. In this edition both Herman's above-mentioned translations of treatises about Islam appeared together with a preface by [[Martin Luther]].

==Translations of the classics==
*'''Euclid''' – ''Euclidis geometria (Elementa)''.  Herman translated [[Euclid's Elements]] around 1140, possibly in collaboration with Robert of Ketton.  (There were also other twelfth century translations).
*'''Ptolemy''' – the Latin translation of [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]]'s work ''[[Planisphaerium]]'' is a significant work which was produced in [[Toulouse]] in 1143.
Herman translated it from an Arabic translation from the Greek (jointly with commentaries of [[Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti]], who worked in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in the 10th century). Western European [[Scholasticism|scholastics]] became aware of Ptolemy's astronomical views via this translation dedicated to Thierry of Chartres. (This translation was for a long time believed to be the only surviving link to Ptolemy's original. Later another Arabic translation was found to have been preserved in [[Istanbul]]).

Herman also translated Ptolemy's ''Canon'' ([[Canon of Kings]]). For long many thought that Ptolemy was translated by German Herman Contractus and not by Herman of Carinthia.

==Astrology and astronomy==
Herman's first known translation was the sixth book of an astrological treatise ''Liber sextus astronomie'' by the Jewish writer  [[Sahl ibn Bishr]].  It was released in Spain in 1138 under the title ''Zaelis fatidica'' (''Prophesy'').  Sahl ibn Bishr had been writing in the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] astrological tradition. Ibn Bishr's first five books were preserved in the translation of [[John of Seville]] (Johannes Hispanus) (circa 1090 – circa 1150). The sixth book deals with three thematic topics regarding the influences on the world and its inhabitants. The work contains [[divination]]s based on the movements of the planets and comets.

Circa 1140 Herman translated into Latin the astronomical work of [[Abu Ma'shar]] ''Kitab al-madkhal ila ilm ahkam al nujum'' (''Introduction to Astronomy'').&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Astronomy, Containing the Eight Divided Books of Abu Ma'shar Abalachus|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2998|work=Astronomy &amp; allied sciences|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work contains problems from Greek philosophy, Arabic [[astronomy]] and Eastern [[astrology]], and was first translated into Latin by John of Seville in 1133.  Herman's less literal translation was published several times under the title ''Liber introductorius in astronomiam Albumasaris, Abalachii'' (Augusta Vindelicorum, [[Augsburg]] 1489; [[Venice]] 1495 and 1506). A large part of Herman's translation was copied into [[Roger of Hereford]]'s ''Book of Astronomical Judgements''.

Herman produced a version of [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Ḵwārizmī]]'s astronomical tables (''zij'') – they were also translated in 1126 by [[Adelard of Bath]] (1075–1164).

Charles Burnett (2001) postulates that Herman collaborated with Robert of Ketton and [[Hugo of Santalla]] on the ''Liber novem iudicum'' (the Book of Nine Judges), a collection of translations of Arabic astrologers, notably [[al-Kindi]]. Their project may have been to supplant the current superstitious Latin astrology with Arabic astronomical science. Arabic texts cite often [[Hermes Trismegistus|Hermes]] as an authority. Burnett postulates that Renaissance magi merely continued this Hermetic tradition begun by Herman, Robert and Hugh. Herman shares technical terminology with Hugh and a penchant for evocation of the ''[[Hermetica|Asclepius]]'', most notably in ''De essentiis'' (see below)

==Original contributions==
His original contribution to philosophy was ''De essentiis'' (''On essences'').{{sfn|Burnett|1981|p=167}} In this work Herman deals with five [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] categories ([[cause|causa]], [[motion (physics)|motus]], [[space|spatium]], [[time|tempus]], [[habitat (ecology)|habitudo]]). He started to write this treatise in 1143 in Toulouse and he completed it the same year in [[Béziers]].{{sfn|Burnett|1976|p=231-232}} In 1982 this book was reprinted in Germany.

Some other works are believed to be Herman's:
* meteorological ''Liber imbrium'' (''A book about precipitations'') (1140 to 1141)
* astrological ''De indagatione cordis'' (''About heart researches'') (after 1140)
In the text (or ''a manuscript'', the syntax of this article was not clear) of ''De indagatione cordis'' there are many names of scientists and scholars whose work Herman knew and used: [[Abu Mashar|Abu Mas'har]] (787–886), Sahl ibn Bishr, Aomar Tiberia, Abu [[al-Kindi]] (801–873), the eighth-century Jewish astrologer Al Batrig [[Mashallah ibn Athari|Mashallah]] (Messahalla), Hermes, and Dorotheos of [[Sidon]].
*mathematical and astronomical ''De mensura, De utilitatibus astrolabii'', ''De compositione et usu astrolabii'' (before 1143 – Herman was certainly interested in the [[Astrolabe]] – the portrait shows Herman with one)

Many medieval authors refer to Herman's work, for instance Albert the Great (Albert von Bollstädt, [[Albertus Magnus]]), instructor to [[Thomas Aquinas]], in his work ''Speculum astronomiae''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3009">'''Hippo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɪ|p|oʊ}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἵππων}}, ''Hippon''; fl. 5th century BC) was a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] Greek philosopher. He is variously described as coming from [[Rhegium]],&lt;ref name="hippolytus1"&gt;Hippolytus, i.16&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metapontum]],&lt;ref&gt;Censorinus; Claudius Mamertinus&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samos Island|Samos]],&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus{{full|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Crotone|Croton]],&lt;ref name="med1"&gt;''Medical Writings'', [[Anonymus Londinensis|London Papyrus 137]], col. xi. 22–42&lt;/ref&gt; and it is possible that there was more than one philosopher with this name. 

==Philosophy==
Although he was a [[natural philosophy|natural philosopher]], [[Aristotle]] refused to place him among the other great [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic philosophers]] "because of the paltriness of his thought."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphys''. i.3.984a3&lt;/ref&gt; At some point Hippo was accused of [[atheism]],&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, ''in Physics'', 23.21–29: "Hippo, who is actually thought to have been an atheist"&lt;/ref&gt; but as his works have perished, we cannot be certain why. He was accused of [[impiety]] by the comic poet [[Cratinus]] in his ''Panoptae'',&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Poetae Comici Graeci|PCG]] F 167 Kassel–Austin = [[Diels–Kranz numbering system|DK]] 38 A 2&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to [[Clement of Alexandria]], Hippo supposedly ordered the following couplet to be inscribed on his tomb:&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, ''Exhortation to the Greeks'', iv. 55 (DK 38 B 2)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Behold the tomb of Hippo, whom in death&lt;br&gt;
Fate made an equal of the immortal gods.}}

According to [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], Hippo held [[Water (classical element)|water]] and [[fire (classical element)|fire]] to be the primary elements, with fire originating from water, and then developing itself by generating the [[universe]]. [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], too, says that Hippo thought that water was the principle of all things.&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, ''in Physics'', 23.21–29&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the accounts of his philosophy suggest that he was interested in [[biological]] matters. He thought that there is an appropriate level of moisture in all living things, and [[disease]] is caused when the moisture is out of balance.&lt;ref name="med1"/&gt; He also viewed the [[soul]] as arising from both mind and water.&lt;ref name="hippolytus1"/&gt; A medieval [[scholium]] on [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[The Clouds]]'' attributes to Hippo the view that the [[firmament|heavens]] were like the dome ({{lang|grc|πνιγεύς}}) of an [[oven]] covering the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas M. MacDowell]], (1995), ''Aristophanes and Athens: An Introduction to the Plays'', page 120. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Huw Price''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|j|uː|_|p|r|aɪ|s}}; born 17 May 1953) is an Australian philosopher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Companion to Philosophy in Australia and New Zealand|url=http://books.publishing.monash.edu/apps/bookworm/view/A+Companion+to+Philosophy+in+Australia+and+New+Zealand/56/xhtml/chapter15b.html#chapter15sec33|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; currently the Bertrand Russell Professor in the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty of Philosophy – Teaching and Research Staff|url=http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/people/teaching-research|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinity College – The Fellowship|url=http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/index.php?pageid=321|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

He was previously [[Challis Professor]] of Philosophy and Director of the Centre for Time at the [[University of Sydney]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sydney.edu.au/centre_for_time/people/|title=Centre for Time: People|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and before that Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.ed.ac.uk/phil_history/index.php|title=History - The University of Edinburgh|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also one of three founders and the Academic Director of the [[Centre for the Study of Existential Risk]] at the University of Cambridge, and the Academic Director of the [[Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence]].

==Work==
Price is known for his work in [[philosophy of physics]] and for his brand of "[[neo-pragmatism]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/46002-expressivism-pragmatism-and-representationalism/|title=Review of Expressivism, Pragmatism and Representationalism|first=John|last=MacFarlane|date=5 February 2014|publisher=|via=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[anti-representationalism]]," according to which "all utterances must be looked at through the lens of their function in our interactions, not the metaphysics of their semantic relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25939-naturalism-without-mirrors/|title=Review of Naturalism without Mirrors|first=Willem|last=deVries|date=8 September 2011|publisher=|via=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This view has acknowledged affinities with the work of [[Robert Brandom]] and, earlier, [[Wilfrid Sellars]].

He was elected a Fellow of [[Australian Academy of the Humanities]] in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanities.org.au/Fellowship/FindFellows/tabid/123/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/1276/Price-Huw.aspx|title=Price, Huw, FBA  FAHA|first=The Australian Academy of the|last=Humanities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/elections/index.cfm?member=19145 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030032759/http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/elections/index.cfm?member=19145 |archivedate=30 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machine intelligence===
Around 2012, Price co-founded the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, stating that "It seems a reasonable prediction that some time in this or the next century intelligence will escape from the constraints of biology." Price voices concern that as computers become smarter than humans, humans could someday be destroyed by "machines that are not malicious, but machines whose interests don't include us," and seeks to push this concern forward in the "respectable scientific community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Risk of robot uprising wiping out human race to be studied|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-20501091|accessdate=13 March 2016|work=[[BBC News]]|date=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cacm.acm.org/news/157834-cambridge-to-study-technologys-risk-to-humans/fulltext|title=Cambridge to Study Technology's Risk to Humans - News - Communications of the ACM|first=The Associated|last=Press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2015, he assumed the directorship of the new Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, stating "Machine intelligence will be one of the defining themes of our century, and the challenges of ensuring that we make good use of its opportunities are ones we all face together. At present, however, we have barely begun to consider its ramifications, good or bad."&lt;ref name="phys.org"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambridge University launches new centre to study AI and the future of intelligence|url=http://phys.org/news/2015-12-cambridge-university-centre-ai-future.html|accessdate=13 March 2016|work=[[phys.org]]|date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1667">'''Importance''' is a subjective indicator of value. As a concept, importance is the recognized attribution of a subject's significance or value as defined by a [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]. In its most basic form, importance is used to define subjects that are essential and relevant from those that are not. A subject that is defined as of having no importance is often seen as having no value.

== Definition ==
[[Merriam-Webster]] defines "important" as "marked by or indicative of significant worth or consequence: valuable in content or relationship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/important | title=Important | publisher=Merriam-Webster.com | accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merriam-Webster's Learner's Dictionary defines "important" as "having serious meaning or worth, deserving or requiring serious attention, and having power, authority, or influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.learnersdictionary.com/definition/important | title="Important" | accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that "the concept of importance appears to be so fundamental that a satisfactory analysis of it may not be possible at all".&lt;ref&gt;Harry G. Frankfurt, ''The Importance of What We Care About: Philosophical Essays'' (1988), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Note that an italicized letter ''s'' or ''t'' is sometimes used for distinction--&gt;

In [[linguistics]], [[logic]], [[philosophy]], and other fields, an '''intension''' is any [[Property (philosophy)|property]] or [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] [[Connotation|connoted]] by a [[word]], [[phrase]], or another symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=117|author=[[Antony Flew]]|date=1979|title=Dictionary of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a word, the word's [[definition]] often implies an intension. For instance, the intensions of the word ''[[plant]]'' include properties including "being composed of [[cellulose]]", "alive", and "organism", among others. A ''[[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]]'' is the collection of all such intensions.

The meaning of a word can be thought of as the bond between the ''idea the word means'' and the ''physical form of the word''. Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913) contrasts three concepts:

# the ''signifier'' – the "sound image" or the string of [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] on a page that one recognizes as the form of a [[Sign (linguistics)|sign]]
# the ''signified'' – the meaning, the [[concept]] or [[idea]] that a sign expresses or evokes
# the ''referent'' – the actual [[Object (philosophy)|thing]] or set of things a sign refers to. See ''[[Sign (semiotics)#Dyadic signs|Dyadic signs]]'' and ''[[Reference#Semantics|Reference (semantics)]]''.

Without intension of some sort, a word has no meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Putnam|first=Hilary|date=1973|title=Meaning and Reference|jstor=2025079|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=70|issue=19|pages=699–711|doi=10.2307/2025079}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the terms ''rantans'' or ''[[Jabberwocky|brillig]]'' have no intension and hence no meaning. Such terms may be suggestive, but a term can be ''suggestive'' without being meaningful. For instance, ''ran tan'' is an archaic onomatopoeia for chaotic noise or din and may suggest to English speakers a din or meaningless noise, and ''brillig'' though made up by [[Lewis Caroll]] may be suggestive of 'brilliant' or 'frigid'. Such terms, it may be argued, are always intensional since they connote the property 'meaningless term', but this is only an apparent paradox and does not constitute a counterexample to the claim that without intension a word has no meaning.  Part of its intension is that it has no extension.  Intension is analogous to the signified in the Saussurean system, [[Extension (semantics)|extension]] to the referent.

In philosophical arguments about [[mind-body dualism|dualism]] versus [[monism]], it is noted that thoughts have intensionality and physical objects do not (S. E. Palmer, 1999), but rather have extension in space and time.

==Statement forms==

A statement-form is simply a form obtained by putting blanks into a sentence where one or more expressions with extensions occur—for instance, "The quick brown ___ jumped over the lazy ___'s back." An instance of the form is a statement obtained by filling the blanks in.

=== Intensional statement form ===

An ''intensional statement-form'' is a statement-form with at least one instance such that substituting co-extensive expressions into it does not always preserve [[logical value]]. An ''intensional statement'' is a statement that is an instance of an intensional statement-form. Here co-extensive expressions are expressions with the same [[extension (semantics)|extension]].

That is, a statement-form is intensional if it has, as one of its instances, a statement for which there are two co-extensive expressions (in the relevant language) such that one of them occurs in the statement, and if the other one is put in its place (uniformly, so that it replaces the former expression wherever it occurs in the statement), the result is a (different) statement with a different logical value. An intensional statement, then, is an instance of such a form; it has the same form as a statement in which substitution of co-extensive terms fails to preserve logical value.

==== Examples ====
#Everyone who has read ''Huckleberry Finn'' knows that Mark Twain wrote it.
#It is possible that Aristotle did not tutor Alexander the Great.
#Aristotle was pleased that he had a sister.

To see that these are intensional, make the following substitutions: (1) "Mark Twain" → "The author of 'Corn-pone Opinions'"; (2) "Aristotle" → "the tutor of Alexander the Great"; (3) can be seen to be intensional given "had a sister" → "had a female sibling."

It will be noted that the intensional statements above feature expressions like "knows", "possible", and "pleased". Such expressions always, or nearly always, produce intensional statements when added (in some intelligible manner) to an extensional statement, and thus they (or more complex expressions like "It is possible that") are sometimes called ''intensional operators''. A large class of intensional statements, but by no means all, can be spotted from the fact that they contain intensional operators.

=== Extensional statement form ===

An ''extensional'' statement is a non-intensional statement. Substitution of co-extensive expressions into it always preserves logical value. A language is intensional if it contains intensional statements, and extensional otherwise. All natural languages are intensional.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The only extensional languages are artificially constructed languages used in [[mathematical logic]] or for other special purposes and small fragments of natural languages.

==== Examples ====
#Mark Twain wrote ''Huckleberry Finn''.
#Aristotle had a sister.

Note that if "Samuel Clemens" is put into (1) in place of "Mark Twain", the result is as true as the original statement. It should be clear that no matter what is put for "Mark Twain", so long as it is a singular term picking out the same man, the statement remains true. Likewise, we can put in place of the [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] any other predicate belonging to Mark Twain and only to Mark Twain, without changing the logical value. For (2), likewise, consider the following substitutions: "Aristotle" → "The tutor of Alexander the Great"; "Aristotle" → "The author of the 'Prior Analytics'"; "had a sister" → "had a sibling with two X-chromosomes"; "had a sister" → "had a parent who had a non-male child".

=== Significance ===
Intensional languages cannot be given an adequate [[semantics]] in terms of the extensions of expressions in them, since the extensions themselves do not suffice to determine a logical value.  (If they did, then one could not change the logical value by substituting co-extensive expressions.)  On the other hand, for the first half of the 20th century the only known systems of formal semantics worked by assigning extensions to expressions and used a [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]-style truth-definition of statements constructed from the primitive expressions of the language under analysis.  Hence, these semantical methods were pathetically inadequate for understanding the semantics of any but a few small artificial languages or mutilated fragments of natural languages.

This situation changed in the 1960s with the invention of possible-world or "intensional" semantics, the main form of which is due to [[Saul Kripke]]. Though this has enabled improvements in the semantic modelling of natural languages, much work remains to be done.

Three '''International Eugenics Congresses''' took place between 1912 and 1932 and were the global venue for scientists, politicians, and social leaders to plan and discuss the application of programs to improve human heredity in the early twentieth century.

==Background==
Assessing the work of [[Charles Darwin]], and pondering the experience of animal breeders and horticulturists, [[Francis Galton]] wondered if the human genetic make-up could be improved: “The question was then forced upon me - Could not the race of men be similarly improved? Could not the undesirables be got rid of and the desirables multiplied?”&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Karl Pearson]]|title=The Life, Letters, and Labours of Francis Galton|publisher=University Press, London, 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of [[eugenics]] - a term he introduced - soon won many adherents, notably in North America and England. First practical steps were taken in the [[United States of America]]. The government under [[Theodore Roosevelt]] created a national [[Heredity Commission]] that was charged to investigate the genetic heritage of the country and to “(encourage) the increase of families of good blood and (discourage) the vicious elements in the cross-bred American civilization”.&lt;ref name="Bruinius"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruinius, Harry|title= Better For All the World. The Secret History of Forced Sterilization and America's Quest for Racial Purity|publisher= A. A. Knopf, New York, 2006. {{ISBN|0-375-41371-5}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Davenport]] supported by the [[Carnegie Institution]] established the [[Eugenics Record Office]]. Further significant funding for the eugenics movement came from [[E. H. Harriman]] and [[Vernon Kellogg]]. In an effort to eradicate unfit offspring sterilization laws were passed, the first one in [[Indiana]] (1907), then in other states, many strictly for eugenic reasons, "to better the race," allowing for [[compulsory sterilization]]. Other eugenic laws limited the right to marry.&lt;ref name="Bruinius"/&gt;

==The First International Eugenics Congress (1912)==
The ''First International Eugenics Congress'' took place in [[London]] on July 24–29, 1912. It was organized by the British [[Eugenics Education Society]] and dedicated to Galton who had died the year prior.&lt;ref name="Bruinius"/&gt; Major [[Leonard Darwin]], the son of Charles Darwin, was presiding. The five-day meeting saw about 400 delegates at the Hotel Cecil in London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9907E5DD1630E233A25756C2A9619C946396D6CF New York Times 7/25/1912]&lt;/ref&gt; Luminaries included [[Winston Churchill]], First Lord of the British Admiralty and [[Richard Webster, 1st Viscount Alverstone|Lord Alverstone]], the Chief Justice, [[Lord Balfour]], as well as the ambassadors of Norway, Greece, and France.  In his opening address Darwin indicated that the introduction of principles of better breeding procedures for humans would require moral courage. The American exhibit was sponsored by the [[American Breeders' Association]] and demonstrated the incidence of hereditary defects in human pedigrees. A report by [[Bleeker van Wagenen]] presented information about American sterilization laws and propagated compulsory sterilization as the best method to cut off “defective germ-plasm”. In the final address, Major Darwin extolled eugenics as the practical application of the principle of evolution.&lt;ref name="Bruinius"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2334093 | pages=253–255 | volume=2 | issue=2692 | journal=Br Med J | title=FIRST INTERNATIONAL EUGENICS CONGRESS | doi=10.1136/bmj.2.2692.253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Second International Eugenics Congress (1921)==
The second Congress, originally scheduled for New York in 1915, met at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York on September 25–27, 1921 with [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] presiding. [[Alexander Graham Bell]] was the honorary president. The [[State Department]] mailed the invitations around the world.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Edwin Black]]|title=War Against the Weak. Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race |publisher=Four Walls Eight Windows, New York (2003) {{ISBN|1-56858-258-7}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under American leadership and dominance - forty-one out of fifty-three scientific papers - the work of the eugenicists disrupted by [[World War I]] in Europe was to resume. Delegates participated not only from Europe and North America, but also from Latin America (Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela, El Salvador, and Uruguay), and Asia (Japan, India, Siam). The major guest speaker, Major Darwin, advocated eugenic measures that needed to be taken, namely the "elimination of the unfit", the discouragement of large families in the "ill-endowed", and the encouragement of large families in the "well-endowed".&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/09/25/98744440.pdf New York Times,9/25/1921]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Third International Eugenics Congress (1932)==
The third meeting was arranged at the American Museum of Natural History in [[New York City]] August 22–23, 1932, dedicated to [[Mary Williamson Averell]] who had provided significant financial support, and presided by Davenport. Osborn's address emphasized birth selection over [[birth control]] as the method to better the offspring.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1932/08/21/archives/eugenics-congress-opens-here-today-scientists-of-many-nations-to-at.html New York Times 8/21/1932]&lt;/ref&gt; F. Ramos from [[Cuba]] proposed that immigrants should be carefully checked for harmful traits, and suggested deportations of their descendants if inadmissible traits would become later apparent. Major Darwin, now 88 years old, was unable to attend but sent a report presented by [[Ronald Fisher]] predicting the doom of civilization unless eugenic measures were implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1932/08/23/archives/major-darwin-predicts-civilizations-doom-unless-century-brings-wide.html New York Times,8/23/1932]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Rüdin]] was unanimously elected president of the [[International Federation of Eugenics Organizations]] (IFEO).

The congress published "A Decade of Progress in Eugenics",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 2985491 | page=235 | volume=27 | issue=3 | journal=Eugen Rev | title=A decade of progress in eugenics. Scientific papers of the third international congress of eugenics, held at the American museum of national history, New York, August 21st-23rd, 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific Papers of the Third International Congress of Eugenics.

A Fourth International Eugenics Conference was not convened. The IFEO held two more international meetings, one at Zurich in 1934 and the last one at [[Scheveningen]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hodson, CBS| title=International Federation of Eugenics Organizations. Report of the 1936 Conference |journal=The Eugenics Review |volume = 28 |pages =217–219| pmc=2985601 | date = October 1936 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, [[Hermann Joseph Muller]] gave a speech to the Third International Eugenics Congress, and stated "eugenics might yet perfect the human race but only in a society consciously organized for the common good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/eugenics-crusade/#part01 |title=The Eugenics Crusade What's Wrong with Perfect? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=October 16, 2018 |website= |publisher=PBS |access-date=November 4, 2018 |quote=There is no scientific basis for the conclusion that the socially lower class have genetically inferior intellectual equipment. Certain slum districts of our cities are factories for criminality among those who happen to be born in them.  Under these circumstances, it is society, not the individual, which is the real criminal and which stands to be judged.  Eugenics might yet perfect the human race but only in a society consciously organized for the common good.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Heynlin''', variously spelled ''Heynlein'', ''Henelyn'', ''Henlin'', ''Hélin'', ''Hemlin'', ''Hegelin'', ''Steinlin''; and translated as ''Jean à Lapide'', ''Jean La Pierre (Lapierre, de la Pierre)'', ''Johannes Lapideus'', ''Johannes Lapidanus'', ''Johannes de Lapide'' (c. 1425 &amp;ndash; 12 March 1496) was a [[Germany|German]]-born scholar, [[humanism|humanist]], and theologian who introduced the first [[printing press]] to Paris (and [[France]] in general) in the late fifteenth century.

Born in [[Königsbach-Stein|Stein]], near [[Pforzheim]], in [[Baden-Württemberg]], Heynlin may have been of [[Swabia]]n origin. (From ''Stein'', meaning "stone" in [[German language|German]], are derived his translated Latinized surname ''Lapideus'' and Gallicized surnames ''La Pierre'' or ''à Lapide''.) On the completion of his academic studies in [[Germany]], presumably at [[Leipzig]] and [[Freiburg]], he proceeded to [[Paris]] to pursue the study of [[philosophy]] and [[theology]]. In Paris, he came in contact with the foremost representatives of [[Philosophical realism|Realism]], who, recognizing Heynlin's abilities and probable future influence, exerted their powers to the utmost to mould his mind after their own and thus make him like themselves a bitter opponent of [[Nominalism]]. Their efforts were successful.

In 1464, Heynlin went to the [[University of Basel]] and applied for admission to the professorial faculty of arts. The old controversy regarding the nature of [[Universal (metaphysics)|Universals]] had not yet subsided, and in the university of Basel Nominalism held sway. Hence in view of this and the maintenance of peace within the institution, the admission of Heynlin to the faculty was not accomplished without a most vigorous opposition.

Once a member of the faculty, he hoped to rid it of all Nominalistic tendencies, nor was he disappointed in his expectation. In 1465, he became dean of the faculty of arts and in this capacity he revised the university statutes and thus brought about a firmly established curriculum of studies. In 1466, he returned to Paris, obtained the doctorate in [[theology]], was in 1469 elected rector of the university and became professor of theology at the [[University of Sorbonne|Sorbonne]].

== Heynlin's printing press ==
Heynlin's most noteworthy achievement was the establishment of the first printing-press in Paris. Heynlin worked closely with [[Guillaume Fichet]] (1433-ca. 1480), another professor at the Sorbonne, who had also come from abroad: from [[Le Petit-Bornand-les-Glières]], in [[Savoy]].

Heynlin brought Swiss workmen to install this press in the buildings of the Sorbonne at the end of 1469 or the beginning of 1470: Ulric Gering (Guerinch or Guernich) (1445-1510), Michel Friburger, and Martin Crantz (or Krantz). Ulric Gering may have come from [[Münster]], Friburger from [[Colmar]], and Crantz may have also come from Münster or [[Strasbourg]]. Heynlin gave valuable pecuniary aid to their undertakings, especially for the printing of the works of the [[Church Fathers]]. [[Louis XI of France|King Louis XI]] granted letters of naturalization to all three workmen in 1475.

Their first publication with this press, and the first book printed in France, was a collection of letters by the fifteenth century grammarian [[Gasparinus de Bergamo]] (Gasparin de Pergame). The ''Epistolae Gasparini'' (1470) were intended to provide an exemplar for students for the writing of artful and elegant [[Latin]]. Their second work was a translation of [[Sallust]] (1470-1471), the third the ''Orationes'' of [[Bessarion]] (1471), and the fourth was Fichet's own ''Rhetorica'' in 1471. The number of the works which they published from 1470 to 1472 amounts to some thirty works.

At the end of 1472 or at the beginning of 1473, Heynlin and Fichet left the Sorbonne to settle on [[Rue Saint-Jacques (Paris)|Rue Saint-Jacques]]. Two of their apprentices, [[Pierre de Kaysere]] (Petrus Caesaris) and [[Jean Stoll]], established around the same time and on the same street their own competing printing press, with the emblem of the ''Soufflet-Vert''.

== Other activities ==
The German humanist [[Johann Reuchlin]] attached himself to Heynlin, whom he followed to the young [[University of Basel]] in 1474.

In 1478, he was called to teach [[theology]] in the newly founded [[University of Tübingen]], where his learning, eloquence and reputation secured for him the same year the rectorship. The opposition, however, he met from the Nominalists [[Gabriel Biel]], [[Paul Scriptoris]], and others, rendered his service here of short duration. He severed his connexion with the university, proceeded to [[Baden-Baden]] and thence to [[Berne]], where he engaged in preaching. Dissatisfied with Berne, he returned to Basel, and tired of wandering, he entered in 1487 the [[Carthusians|Carthusian]] monastery of St. Margarethenthal to spend his declining years in prayer and literary work.

== Works ==
*''Compendiosus de arte punctandi dialogus'', found in ''Orthographia Clarissimi Oratoris Gasparini Bergomensis'', 1470.
*''Premonitio circa sermones de conceptione gloriose virginis Marie'', found in Meffret, ''Sermones de tempore et de sanctis'', 1488.

He also wrote extensively on Chicano and Native American thought.

==Biography==
Known internationally for his efforts to promote peace and human rights, Haddox worked with many organizations over the years, including the [[American Friends Service Committee]] and the student organization [[MEChA]].&lt;ref&gt;''Thought and Social Engagement in the Mexican-american Philosophy of John H. Haddox: A Collection of Critical Appreciations'', Edited by Sanchez, Carlos Alberto, &amp; Simon, Jules, Edwin Mellen Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  He lectured in Brasília, Brazil, at the National University of Mexico, at Oxford and Cambridge Universities in the UK, at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic, and at universities and academic meetings throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="ia.utep.edu" /&gt;  He was appointed by [[Pope Paul VI]] Knight of the [[Order of St Gregory the Great]]. Haddox was a close friend and collaborator with Mexican pacifist and diplomat [[Heberto Sein]] during his later years.

John Haddox was born in [[Pawnee, Oklahoma]].  He served in the U.S. military during the [[Korean War]], and met his wife, Carmen (Mendoza) Haddox, while stationed at [[William Beaumont Army Medical Center]].  They raised eleven children.&lt;ref name="ia.utep.edu" /&gt;

==Main ideas==
Haddox received his doctorate from the [[University of Notre Dame]], where he came under the influence of [[Jacques Maritain]] and the "new [[scholasticism]]."  With a strong background in science (he had originally intended to study medicine), and influenced by [[Alexander Ivanovich Oparin]] and his ideas concerning [[abiogenesis]] as well as scholastic ideas of universal order, he championed [[teleology]] in biology.&lt;ref name="John H. Haddox 2009"&gt;Thought and Social Engagement in the Mexican-american Philosophy of John H. Haddox: A Collection of Critical Appreciations, Edited by Sanchez, Carlos Alberto, &amp; Simon, Jules, Edwin Mellen Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  When he began teaching in a [[bicultural]] environment, his focus changed from the philosophy of science to ethics and social philosophy.  John Haddox has been called a "religious existentialist" and a "personalist."&lt;ref&gt;Thought and Social Engagement in the Mexican-american Philosophy of John H. Haddox: A Collection of Critical Appreciations'', Edited by Sanchez, Carlos Alberto, &amp; Simon, Jules, Edwin Mellen Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  He argued for the need to include Latin American philosophers, and especially Mexican philosophers, into the philosophical canon.  He made the case that worldviews emerging from the "territorial minorities" in the United States, Chicanos and Native Americans, constitute unique and fully developed philosophical positions as well.&lt;ref&gt;Chicanos and Native Americans: the territorial minorities, Ed., Rodolfo O. De la Garza, Z. Anthony Kruszewski, Tomás A. Arciniega, PrenticeHall, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  Out of his interest in Latin American philosophers such as [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], [[José Enrique Rodó]], [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]], [[Leopoldo Zea]], [[José Vasconcelos]] and [[Antonio Caso]], who were fully involved in the social, political and educational movements of their time, Haddox developed a philosophy of activism.&lt;ref name="John H. Haddox 2009"/&gt;  The duty of the philosopher is to be engaged in society, from an ethical perspective, and to form through education conscientious citizens.  The teaching of social ethics awakens the human conscience, replacing the instinctive with altruism.  These ideas are embodied in his famous paraphrase of Caso: "The properly and distinctively human feature of man is his ability to say to others ‘take,’ ‘take of my time,’ ‘take of my concern,’ ‘take of my interest,’ 'take of my possessions,' even, ‘take of ''me''.'"&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Caso, Philosopher of Mexico, John Haddox, University of Texas Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4540">'''Léon Ollé-Laprune''' (25 June 1839&amp;nbsp;– 19 February 1898) was a French Catholic philosopher.

==Life==

Under the influence of the philosopher [[Elme Marie Caro]] and of [[Père Gratry]]'s book ''Les Sources'', Ollé-Laprune, after exceptionally brilliant studies at the [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]] (1858 to 1861), devoted himself to philosophy. His life was spent in teaching, first in the ''[[lycée]]s ''and then in the Ecole Normale Supérieure from 1875.

As [[Frédéric Ozanam]] had been a Catholic professor of history and foreign literature in the university, Ollé-Laprune's aim was to be a Catholic professor of philosophy there. [[Theodore de Regnon]], the [[Jesuit]] theologian, wrote to him:

:"I am glad to think that God wills in our time to revive the lay apostolate, as in the times of Justin and Athenagoras; it is you especially who give me these thoughts."

The Government of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] was now and then urged by a certain section of the press to punish the "clericalism" of Ollé-Laprune, but the repute of his philosophical teaching protected him. For one year only (1881–82), after organizing a manifestation in favour of the expelled congregations, he was suspended from his chair by [[Jules Ferry]], and the first to sign the protest addressed by his students to the minister on behalf of their professor was the future socialist deputy [[Jean Jaurès]], then a student at the Ecole Normale Supérieure.

The [[Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]] elected him a member of the philosophical section in 1897, to succeed [[Vacherot]]. Some months after his death [[William P. Coyne]] called him  "the greatest Catholic layman who has appeared in France since Ozanam" ("New Ireland Review", June, 1899, p.&amp;nbsp;195).

==Works==

Ollé-Laprune's first important work was ''La Philosophie de Malebranche'' (1870). Ten years later to obtain the doctorate he defended before the [[Sorbonne]] a thesis on [[moral certitude]]. As against Cartesian rationalism and positivistic determinism, he investigated the part of the will and the heart in the phenomenon of belief. This work resembles in many respects [[John Henry Newman]]'s ''Grammar of Assent''.

In his "Essai sur la morale d'Aristote" (1881) Ollé-Laprune defended the "Eudaemonism" of the Greek philosopher against the [[Kantian]] theories; and in "La philosophie et le temps présent" (1890) he vindicated, against [[deistic]] spiritualism, the right of the Christian thinker to go beyond the data of "natural religion" and illuminate philosophy by the data of revealed religion.

One of his most influential works was the "Prix de la vie" (1894), wherein he shows why life is worth living. The advice given by [[Pope Leo XIII]] to the Catholics of France found in Ollé-Laprune an active champion. His brochure "Ce qu'on va chercher à Rome" (1895) was one of the best commentaries on the papal policy.

His articles and conferences attest his growing influence in Catholic circles. He became a leader of Christian activity, consulted and heard by all until his premature death when he was about to finish a book on [[Jouffroy]] (Paris, 1899). Many of his articles have been collected by [[Goyau]] under the title "La Vitalité chrétienne" (1901). Here will also be found a series of his unedited meditations, "Omnia instaurare in Christo". Professor [[Delbos]] of the University of Paris published in 1907 the course which Ollé-Laprune had given on reason and rationalism (''La raison et le rationalisme'').

Majoragio was born Maria Antonio Conti in a place in the proximity of Milan in Italy, known as [[Majoragio]].&lt;ref name="JE Sandys"/&gt;

Majoragio was professor for a time at Milan, and a scholar who was known to have studied after the ancient Roman philosopher and orator  [[Cicero]]. During 1542 he attended lectures held within Ferrara, these lectures were performed by [[Maggi]] on the subject of philosophy, and by [[Alciati]] on jurisprudence.  He occupied an intellectual position both in defence of Cicero, in respect to [[Calcagnini's]] attack on the work ''[[De Officiis]]''  and contrary and in some way hostile, in respect to the work ''[[Paradoxa Stoicorum]]'', in this case in his own work ''Antiparadoxon''. In ''Antiparadoxon'' Majoragio expressed the thought that Cicero's work was composed of dialogues which were un-Socratic, and more over, that Cicero's work was in fact demonstrably untrue.&lt;ref name="JE Sandys"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J Papy"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ne_x6FF3P3UC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=Paradoxa+Stoicorum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qLn4QwmrA0&amp;sig=I1V-1l0P-QZhh_Q3w0EMkkLimKk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u7MlVZzkHIrnaMeqgvAE&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&amp;q=Paradoxa%20Stoicorum&amp;f=false|author=J Papy|title=Christian Humanism: Essays in Honour of Arjo Vanderjagt|publisher=BRILL, 2009 (edited by AAA MacDonald - Ph.D. (1978), University of Edinburgh, ZRWM von Martels -  Ph.D. (1989) University of Groningen, J Riepke Veenstra - Ph.D. (1997), Faculty of Philosophy, University of Groningen,  {{ISBN|9004176314}} (494 pages)|accessdate=2015-04-09}}(ed. info retrieved additionally 2015-05-24, source shows &lt; "... published an open attack against Cicero..."&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JE Sandys"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e1sVPw3uDMEC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=Marcantonio+Majoragius&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SkcmVdT4D8jjaIbAgoAH&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Marcantonio%20Majoragius&amp;f=false|author=JE Sandys|title=A History of Classical Scholarship: From the Revival of Learning to the End of the Eighteenth Century in Italy, France, England and the Netherlands|publisher=''Volume 2 of A History of Classical Scholarship 3 Volume''  Cambridge University Press, 17 Feb 2011 (reprint, reissue) {{ISBN|1108027075}} |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Majoragio believed in Platonic Christianity, and thought that those who  expressed contrary thoughts, that there was no after-life and the present material world was the only world that exists should be righteously condemned to the fate of having themselves burnt alive, and additionally those punished thus, to be in full consciousness during such an act.&lt;ref name="J Papy"/&gt;

==Works==
Majoragio produced the following:&lt;ref name="JE Sandys"/&gt;

*A 1546 work of criticism against ''[[Paradoxa Stoicorum]]''
*A 1547 commentary on Aristotle's - [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]].
*A 1552 commentary on [[Orator (Cicero)|Orator]] written by Cicero.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2217">A '''mediated reference theory'''&lt;ref&gt;Siobhan Chapman (ed.), ''Key Ideas in Linguistics and the Philosophy of Language'', Edinburgh University Press, 2009, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; (also '''indirect reference theory''')&lt;ref name=Berezowski&gt;Leszek Berezowski, ''Articles and Proper Names'', University of Wrocław, 2001, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; is any [[semantic]] theory that posits that words refer to something in the external world, but insists that there is more to the meaning of a name than simply the object to which it refers. It thus stands opposed to the theory of [[direct reference]]. [[Gottlob Frege]] is a well-known advocate of mediated reference theories.&lt;ref name=Berezowski/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Fitch, ''Naming and Believing'', Springer, 2012, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar theories were widely held in the middle of the twentieth century by philosophers such as [[Peter Strawson]] and [[John Searle]].

Mediated reference theories are contrasted with [[Direct reference theory|theories of direct reference]].

[[Saul Kripke]], a proponent of direct reference theory, in his ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' dubbed mediated reference theory the '''Frege–Russell view'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; and criticized it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Saul Kripke]], ''[[Naming and Necessity]]''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1972. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent scholarship refuted the claim that [[Bertrand Russell]]'s views on reference theory were the same as Frege's, since Russell was also a proponent of direct reference theory.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Wettstein, "Frege-Russell Semantics?", ''Dialectica'' '''44'''(1/2), 1990, pp. 113–135, esp. 115: "Russell maintains that when one is acquainted with something, say, a present sense datum or oneself, one can refer to it without the mediation of anything like a Fregean sense. One can refer to it, as we might say, ''directly''."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5981">The '''Metaphysical Society''' was a British society, founded in 1869 by [[James Knowles (architect)|James Knowles]].  Many of its members were prominent clergymen.

Papers were read and discussed at meetings on such subjects as the ultimate grounds of belief in the objective and moral sciences, the immortality of the soul, etc. A description of one of the meetings was given by [[William Connor Magee]] (then [[Bishop of Peterborough]]) in a letter of February 13, 1873:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Archbishop Manning in the chair was flanked by two Protestant bishops right and left; on my right was [[Richard Holt Hutton|Hutton]], editor of the ''Spectator'', an Arian; then came Father Dalgairns, a very able Roman Catholic priest; opposite him [[Lord Arthur Russell|Lord A. Russell]], a Deist; then two [[Scottish people|Scotch]] metaphysical writers, Freethinkers; then Knowles, the very broad editor of the Contemporary; then, dressed as a layman and looking like a country squire, was Ward, formerly [[William George Ward|Rev. Ward]], and earliest of the perverts to Rome; then Greg, author of ''The Creed of Christendom'', a Deist; then [[James Anthony Froude|Froude, the historian]], once a deacon in our Church, now a Deist; then [[Roden Noel|Roden Noël]], an actual Atheist and red republican, and looking very like one! Lastly [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], who read a paper on miracles, which we discussed for an hour and a half! Nothing could be calmer, fairer, or even, on the whole, more reverent than the discussion. In my opinion, we, the Christians, had much the best of it. Dalgairns, the priest, was very masterly; Manning, clever and precise and weighty; Froude, very acute, and so was Greg. We only wanted a Jew and a Muslim to make our Religious Museum complete (''Life'', i. 284).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The last meeting of the society was held on May 16, 1880 and it was dissolved later in November of that year.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Christopher A. Kent, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/theme.jsp?articleid=45584 "Metaphysical Society (act. 1869–1880)"], ''[[Dictionary_of_National_Biography#Oxford_Dictionary_of_National_Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], (http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/theme/45584), 2004. Retrieved 15 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley said that it died "of too much love"; Tennyson, "because after ten years of strenuous effort no one had succeeded in even defining [[metaphysics]]." According to Dean Stanley, "We all meant the same thing if we only knew it."

MoPIRG began in March, 1971, after students at St. Louis University heard a speech by [[Ralph Nader]]. Nader inspired the students to organize citizen action groups modeled after similar groups in Oregon and Minnesota. The Center for Student Action at St. Louis University and the Missouri Public Action Council at Washington University lobbied to establish a public interest research organization funded by a small assessment added to student activities fees. Student referenda on both campuses supported the fee assessment. The two student groups combined their operations and formed MoPIRG.&lt;ref name="The State Historical Society of Missouri"&gt;{{cite web |title=S0436 Missouri Public Interest Research Group (Moprig), Records, 1971-1981|url=http://shs.umsystem.edu/stlouis/manuscripts/s0436.pdf|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The PIRGs emerged in the early 1970s on U.S. [[college]] campuses. The PIRG model was proposed in the book ''[[Action for a Change]]'' by [[Ralph Nader]] and [[Donald K. Ross (author)|Donald Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nader|first=Ralph|title=Action for a Change: A Student's Manual for Public Interest Organizing|year=1972|publisher=Grossman Publishers|location=New York|author2=Donald Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among other early accomplishments, the PIRGs were responsible for much of the [[Container deposit legislation#United States|Container Deposit Legislation in the United States]], also known as "bottle bills."&lt;ref name="Boston College, The Heights, Volume LVI, Number 4, 22 September 1975"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Boston College]] |url=http://newspapers.bc.edu/cgi-bin/bostonsh?a=d&amp;d=bcheights19750922.2.30|title=PIRG Backs "Bottle Bill"|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Sun Sentinel |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-11-08/news/9102150529_1_bottle-bill-beverage-containers-industry-recycling-program|title=Bottle Bill Beverage Containers Recycling Program"|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MoPIRG began in March, 1971, after students at St. Louis University heard a speech by [[Ralph Nader]]. Nader inspired the students to organize citizen action groups modeled after similar groups in Oregon and Minnesota. The Center for Student Action at St. Louis University and the Missouri Public Action Council at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] lobbied to establish a public interest research organization funded by a small assessment added to student activities fees. Student referenda on both campuses supported the fee assessment. The two student groups combined their operations and formed MoPIRG.&lt;ref name="The State Historical Society of Missouri"/&gt;

MoPIRG's earliest campaigns included a successful appeal to the Federal Trade Commission to investigate deceptive advertising and sales practices by some St. Louis used car dealers in 1972. The group was also represented on the St. Louis Advertising Review Board, a self-regulatory board of the Advertising Club and the Better Business Bureau. MoPIRG gained national attention for its criticism of self-regulation by the advertising industry. MoPIRG also championed the right to representation for St. Louis City Jail prisoners. Their proposal led to the establishment of an ombudsman position by the St. Louis Department of Welfare in August, 1973.&lt;ref name="The State Historical Society of Missouri"/&gt;

MOPIRG was active in campaigns to stop legislation that would raise the legal ceiling of small loan interest rates in Missouri, drafted a consumer protection ordinance presented to the St. Louis Board of Aldermen in September, 1973, and published research on a variety of consumer and citizen related issues. It researched and developed legislation that helped improve workers' compensation laws in Missouri and was also successful in stopping an
effort to eliminate the public display rating system for area restaurants. From 1975 to 1981, MOPIRG developed a comprehensive revision of the state landlord-tenant law and successfully worked for its passage twice in the Missouri House of Representatives, although the bill was defeated both times in the Senate.&lt;ref name="The State Historical Society of Missouri"/&gt;

In 1977, President Jimmy Carter attempted to reform the patronage system of judicial selection for the Circuit Court of Appeals. MOPIRG responded by forming a coalition of eleven political organizations, including the League of Women Voters and the NAACP, to urge Senator Thomas Eagleton to establish a merit nominating process on the state level. Senator Eagleton's resistance to this idea led MoPIRG to work successfully for legislation requiring the President to develop merit selection guidelines.&lt;ref name="The State Historical Society of Missouri"/&gt;

Other issues MoPIRG has been involved with include requiring school testing services to make test results available to students, curbing utility rate increases, reforming media practices, and passing a national advisory referendum that would allow a non-binding public vote on government policy questions.&lt;ref name="The State Historical Society of Missouri"/&gt;

'''Munmyo''' (more specifically '''Seoul Munmyo''' or '''Seonggyungwan Munmyo''') is [[Korea]]'s primary [[temple of Confucius]] ("munmyo" is also the general Korean term for a temple of Confucius). ''Munmyo baehyang'' ({{hangul|문묘배향}}, {{hanja|文廟配享}}) was the highest honor a scholar could achieve during the Joseon. Only eighteen people were granted this honor; they are called the "Eighteen Sages of Korea" or the "Eighteen Confucian Scholars of the East" ({{hangul|동방|18|현}}, {{hanja|東方|18|賢}}). It is located in central [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], at 53 Myeongnyun-dong 3(sam)-ga, [[Jongno District]], on the campus of [[Sungkyunkwan University]].

Munmyo houses a shrine to Confucius known as Daeseongjeon, or "Hall of Great Achievement." The main gate leading to the shrine Sinsammun, literally "Spirit Three Gate", is open only on special occasions such as [[Seokjeon Daeje]]. The central gate is reserved for the spirit of Confucius and his disciple, and no one else may enter through this gate.  Past this gate is the central path that leads to Daeseongjeon, and visitors may not cross this path, especially during a ceremony when the gates are open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Culture/view?articleId=126428 |title=Confucian ceremony at Seonggyungwan Munmyo |work=Korea.net|date= March 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The courtyard is used for the ''[[Seokjeon Daeje]]'' ceremony.  Munmyo also contains two other halls (''Dongmu'' and ''Seomu'', east and west hall), two dormitories (''Dongjae'' and ''Seojae'', east and west dormitories), a Confucian lecture hall called ''Myeongnyundang'', a library called ''Cheonggyeongdang'', and ''Jinsasikdang'' which is the dining hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koreana.kf.or.kr/view.asp?article_id=410&amp;lang=English |title=Sunggyun-gwan, Sanctuary of Confucianism in Korea |work=Korana |author=An Byung-ju }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parandeul.co.kr/munmyo.htm |title=Munmyo Shrine|work=Parandeul }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:NogoIMG 6088.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|''Aak'' musicians at Munmyo Shrine with stone chimes and drums]]
[[File:Sungkyunkwan Sinsammun.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The gate of Sinsammun]]

The Munmyo is based on [[Confucian]] practices from China, where [[Confucius]] and followers of his teachings were honored and venerated. Temples dedicated to [[Confucius]] and other disciples called "temples of Confucius" became widespread during the [[Tang dynasty]]. This idea was brought to [[Korea]] where it was adopted. The Munmyo was begun during the [[Later Silla]], but it wasn't fully developed and completed until 1398 under [[Taejo of Joseon]]. Notable scholars of [[Joseon]], [[Silla]] and [[Goryeo]] were added to the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Joseon Annals, March 19, 1409. No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, other scholars during the Joseon were also added. It was a long process whereby one had to request, apply, and the honour may not be granted until after their death.&lt;ref&gt;Joseon Annals, November 20, 1883. No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present Day==
A ritual called ''Munmyo jerye'' ({{Hangul|문묘제례}}; {{Hanja|文廟祭禮}}) or [[Seokjeon Daeje]], which involves music and dance, is held there each year in the spring (April) and autumn (September); the ritual features ancient music of Chinese origin called ''Munmyo jeryeak'' ({{Hangul|문묘|제례|악}}; {{Hanja|文廟|祭禮|樂}}), which is a form of ''[[aak]]''. Munmyo also served as the national shrine for [[Confucius]], ten of his disciples, and eighteen of Korea's most venerated Confucian scholars including (in the chronological order of enshrinement)  [[Choe Chiwon]], [[Seol Chong]], [[An Hyang]], [[Jeong Mong-ju]], Kim Gweong-pil, Jeong Yeo-chang, [[Jo Gwang-jo]], [[Yi Eon-jeok]], [[Yi Hwang]], [[Yi I]], [[Seong Hon]], [[Kim Jang-saeng]], [[Song Si-yeol]], [[Song Jun-gil]], Pak Se-chae, Kim Inhu, Jo Hun, and [[Kim Jip]].

The musicians are provided by the [[National Gugak Center]].  The instruments used include flutes (''[[hun (instrument)|hun]]'', ''so'', and bamboo flutes), zithers (''seul'' and ''geum''), stone chimes (''[[Bianqing|pyeongyeong]]''), bronze bells (''[[Bianzhong|pyeonjong]]''), various drums played with sticks, tiger-shaped wooden scraper (''[[eo (instrument)|eo]]''), wooden box (''[[Chuk (instrument)|chuk]]''), and wooden clappers (''bak'').

Munmyo is designated by the South Korean government as Historic Site No. 143.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10249">The '''National Biodefense Strategy''' is a security strategy put together by the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump Administration]] in 2018.

According to the White House, it is a vital interest of the United States to manage the risks involved with a biological incident. A biological incident has the potential to cost thousands of lives, cause significant panic, and greatly impact travel and trade. Biological threats, whether they come from nature or are deliberately created, are among the most serious threats facing the US and the international community. Outbreaks of disease caused catastrophic harm to the countries in which they are present.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The National Biodefense Strategy lays out the President's path to protecting the American people and the American way of life, and lays out a plan and set of objectives to counter the threats that can occur from naturally occurring events, accidental events, and deliberate biological terrorism events. The strategy is more than just a federal government strategy; is a call to action for all levels of government as well as physicians, scientists, educators, and is industry.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The strategy was required by Congress. President Trump said that his plan takes bio defense in a new direction that has a more coordinated, centralized approach based on lessons that were learned from past biological incidents such as the [[List of Ebola outbreaks|west Africa Ebola epidemic of 2014]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/09/18/us/politics/ap-us-bio-defense-strategy.html|title=White House Sets 'New Direction' in Biodefense Strategy|last=|first=|date=2018-09-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''New York Times'', "A privately sponsored group that has studied biodefense issues since 2014 applauded the White House's strategy. The [[Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense]] has warned that the U.S. is dangerously vulnerable to a large-scale biological attack and has urged Washington to develop a more comprehensive strategy."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Overview ==
In mid-September 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump implemented a new national biodefense strategy. His new strategy wiped away those of Barack Obama and George W. Bush. The main thrust of the strategy is that a [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] led committee will survey all the gaps in [[biodefense]] within the government and all the agencies that work on it. The committee will include high-level officials from the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. The group will focus on both man-made threats and naturally occurring biological threats. The survey, in turn, will determine funding levels for various agencies for biodefense.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/18/trump-hhs-biodefense-827973|title=Trump puts HHS in charge of defense against biological threats|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Historically, biological warfare agents that have concerned security officials have included a relatively select group of pathogens and toxins, referred to as "traditional BW agents."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Many of the national discussions regarding putting together a national biodefense plan, unfortunately have only taken into account a more narrow vision of what type of toxins would be used in a biological warfare event - those "traditional BW agents." Although the traditional agents will likely remain the main threat over the next decade, the applications of current and emerging technologies that are developing novel biological warfare agents should also be considered and factored into any long-term bow defense strategy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

International agreements, such as the [[Biological Weapons Convention|Biological Weapons and Toxins Convention]] have really not done a lot to stop countries from obtaining and pursuing biological warfare programs. Ironically, following ratification of the agreement, the Soviet Union's technology in biological warfare was at its height.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Federal role ===
The mission of the Federal Government during a biological incident is to:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* save lives
* reduce human suffering
* protect property and the environment
* control the spread of disease
* support community efforts to overcome the physical, emotional, environmental, and economic impacts

=== Federal funding history ===
The push for increased federal funding in biodefense began during President George W. Bush's term in office. For example, in 2006, President Bush, in his annual budget request, requested a total of $5.1 billion for civilian biodefense. This number was a decrease of $2.5 billion from the previous year's budget. The drop was primarily attributed to the absence of [[Project Bioshield Act|Project BioShield]] money in 2006; the money for that year was already allocated the previous year. Overall, the 2006 request contained incremental increases for all agencies involved in biodefense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schuler |first1=Ari |title=Billions for Biodefense: Federal Agency Biodefense Budgeting, FY2005–FY2006 |journal=Biosecurity and Bioterrorism: Biodefense Strategy, Practice, and Science |date=June 2005 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=94–101 |doi=10.1089/bsp.2005.3.94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advanced biological warfare agents ===
Multidisciplinary technology that's been created in the biological sciences arena will have a huge effect globally. They will have the power to completely revolutionize biological warfare because they will be releasing an entirely new class of engineered agents referred to as "advanced biological warfare" (ABW) agents. Future agents could even be engineered to target specific systems within the human body at the molecular level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Future threats ===
According to the academic journal ''Biosecurity and Bioterrorism: Biodefense Strategy, Practice, and Science'', advanced [[biological warfare]] agents will continue to evolve and develop due to technological innovation. At the same time, due to advances in science regarding biology, biological agents will also evolve and get worse. Although advanced biological warfare agents will not replace the traditional threats posed by agents such as [[smallpox]] and [[anthrax]], the advanced biological warfare agents can become a novel approach to counter proliferation, [[Biosecurity|medical countermeasures]], and detection.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Petro |first1=James B. |last2=Plasse |first2=Theodore R. |last3=McNulty |first3=Jack A. |title=Biotechnology: Impact on Biological Warfare and Biodefense |journal=Biosecurity and Bioterrorism: Biodefense Strategy, Practice, and Science |date=September 2003 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=161–168 |doi=10.1089/153871303769201815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Adviser]] [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]] said that biological and chemical weapons "are often referred to as the poor man’s nuclear weapon, so they are particularly attractive to terrorist groups."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== National Memorandum on the Support for National Biodefense ==
On September 18, 2018, in conjunction with his release of the National Biodefense Strategy, President Trump issued a memorandum on his biodefense strategy to his cabinet and heads of major relevant agencies. The memorandum dictates the policy of the United States with regards to biodefense. It officially forms a new committee, which is chaired by the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]]. Several other high-level cabinet members will sit on the committee, and it will be the committee's charge to implement the National Biodefense Strategy. In addition, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must establish a new special team of people from across different agencies to carry out the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-support-national-biodefense/|title=Presidential Memorandum on the Support for National Biodefense {{!}} The White House|work=The White House|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Biodefense Strategy ==
The official vision of the National Biodefense Strategy is as follows: "The United States actively and effectively prevents, prepares for, responds to, recovers from, and mitigates risk from natural, accidental, or deliberate biological threats."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/National-Biodefense-Strategy.pdf|title=The National Biodefense Strategy 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=The Office of the President of the United States|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Private sector actors ===
According to ''[[Politico]]'', "Senior administration officials later said threats could be better addressed by streamlining processes for biotech companies to work with the HHS's [[Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority]], which supports private sector development of vaccines and drugs."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One official from the Trump Administration said that the government's accounting requirements have made it difficult and undesirable for many companies to participate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund ===
HHS Assistant Secretary [[Robert Kadlec]] said that one of his top priorities was to get a decade-long extension of the Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund. The government can use that fund to buy countermeasures like vaccines, medication, and diagnostic tools. The fund was first authorized under President [[George W. Bush]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He is known for his conservative perspective, his [[atheism]],&lt;ref name="kielzog"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/article/detail/2486886/2001/03/10/God-is-dood-en-in-Zijn-kielzog-neemt-hij-de-koning-mee.dhtml |title=God is dood en in Zijn kielzog neemt hij de koning mee |author=Paul Cliteur |work=Trouw |date=10 March 2001 |accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[republicanism in the Netherlands|republicanism]]&lt;ref name="kielzog"/&gt; and efforts for [[animal rights]]. He is a member of [[De Vrije Gedachte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/archief/kan-ik-dit-wel-zeggen~a711650/ |title=Kan ik dit wel zeggen? |author=Frank van Zijl |work=de Volkskrant |date=26 March 2004 |accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliteur has also been on the board of several organisations, including supervisor of the [[Telders Foundation]] (think tank of the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]]), and from 1993 until 1995 chair of the Humanist League (Humanistisch Verbond).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.leidenuniv.nl/org/metajuridica/encyclopedie/paulcliteur/wie-is-paul-cliteur/paul-cliteur.html |title=Rechtsgeleerde en filosoof |work=Wie is Paul Cliteur? |publisher=[[Leiden University]] |date=25 February 2015 |accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lawyer and philosopher ==
Cliteur studied law and philosophy, and graduated on 22 March 1989 with his dissertation ''Conservatisme en cultuurrecht'' ("Conservatism and cultural law", published in 2005 under the title ''Natuurrecht, Cultuurrecht, Conservatisme'', "Natural law, Cultural law, Conservatism"). From 1995 until 2002, he was Professor of Philosophy at [[Delft University of Technology|Delft University]]. He is Professor of Jurisprudence at [[Leiden University]], where he delivered his maiden speech on 28 May 2004 on "The neutral state, [[Special school (Netherlands)|particular education]] and [[multiculturalism]]". His activities mainly include law, [[cultural history]], philosophy and ethics.

== Columnist and publicist ==
Cliteur is mainly known for his opining works, in which he expresses his political views. He served as a columnist for, amongst others, ''[[Trouw]]'', and had a spoken column in the TV show ''[[Buitenhof (TV series)|Buitenhof]]''. In these, he first and foremost expresses his liberal opinions, his own vision of multiculturism, and also advocates for [[animal rights]].

In March 2004, Cliteur told ''[[Het Parool]]'' in an interview that he felt he was being limited in [[freedom of speech|freely expressing his opinions]] on [[Islam]] after others branded him a "[[racism|racist]]" and "stigmatiser". This was partly due to an [[General Intelligence and Security Service|AIVD]] report, that argued [[criticism of Islam]] is counterproductive for the [[social integration]] of [[Muslim]]s. Cliteur felt it necessary to moderate the tone of his spoken columns for ''Buitenhof''. After being criticised for taking this position, he decided to terminate his contributions to ''Buitenhof'' completely, because he regarded himself to be no longer credible.&lt;ref name="Buitenhof"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.npo.nl/buitenhof/28-03-2004/immix_144574 |title=Buitenhof (2003–2004) |author=Rob Trip |work=[[Buitenhof (TV series)|Buitenhof]] |publisher=[[NPO 1]] |date=28 March 2004 |accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An overview of his philosophy is described in ''Dirk Verhofstadt in gesprek met Paul Cliteur. Een zoektocht naar harmonie'' (2012), an in-depth interview between [[Dirk Verhofstadt]] and Paul Cliteur on Enlightenment values such as the freedom of speech, [[separation of church and state]], the right to self-determination and the equality of every human being.

*In 2001, Paul Cliteur was ambassador of the Stichting Varkens in Nood ("Pigs in Distress Foundation"), and supported Hans Baaij's initiative of a "Universal Declaration of Production Animal Rights".
*In his spoken column in the 1 December 2002 episode of ''Buitenhof'', Cliteur favourably discussed [[Francesco Carotta]]'s theory that Jesus is, in fact, a transformed character of [[Julius Caesar]], originating from erroneous copying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carotta.de/subseite/echo/buitnhof.html Column: De geboorte van Jezus Christus]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 23 December 2002 ''[[Nova (Dutch TV series)|Nova]]'' episode, he called Carotta's theory a "discovery equal to the views of Darwin and Galileo, which overturns all of cultural history". This belief was mocked by [[Nijmegen]]'s classical historian Anton van Hooff, who dubbed it 'atheist superstition'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.skepsis.nl/carotta.html |title=Atheïstisch bijgeloof |author=Anton van Hooff |work=[[Skepter]] 15(4) |publisher=[[Stichting Skepsis]] |date=December 2002}} (including a 4 November 2007 addendum)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tommiehendriks.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/paul-cliteur-versus-anton-van-hooff-modern-zelotisme-en-slotakkoord.pdf Paul Cliteur – Modern zelotisme] (in: “De Vrijdenker”, June 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2004 and 2014, Cliteur was [[lijstduwer]] during the European elections for the [[Party for the Animals]]. He also wrote a contribution in the book "De eeuw van het dier" ("Animal's Century") by [[Marianne Thieme]]. During the [[Dutch general election, 2006]] he was again lijstduwer, however, he simultaneously endorsed number seven of [[EénNL]], former PM Anton van Schijndel ([[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antonvanschijndel.nl/athena/site/php/index.php?action=show&amp;activemenu=-1&amp;file=page&amp;args=action%3Dshow%26id%3D22 |title=Stemoproep voor Van Schijndel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609222619/http://www.antonvanschijndel.nl/athena/site/php/index.php?action=show&amp;activemenu=-1&amp;file=page&amp;args=action%3Dshow%26id%3D22 |archivedate=9 June 2008 }} (via archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt; The JOVD ([[Youth Organisation Freedom and Democracy]]) awarded him the prize for Liberal of the Year 2002.

== Quotes ==
*'[My book ''Against Decadence''] is available at any bookstore, anyone can read it, including [[jihadists]], but I think they can learn a lot from it. I think it's good and that it won't encourage them to commit [[terrorism|[terrorist] attacks]]. But what I ''am'' afraid of, is when such a book is summarised as 'It's actually just stigmatising strangers and that is racism', that does somewhat frighten me. And that does induce a safety risk, because types like [[Volkert van der Graaf|Volkert van der G.]] do look at that, and that may be kept in their minds (...).'&lt;ref name="Buitenhof"/&gt;
*'What we should be really cautious about, is that right now we won't be going in the direction –and it is going slightly in that direction– where a kind of identification will arise like: '[[Criticism of Islam]] = criticism of Muslims = racism'.'&lt;ref name="Buitenhof"/&gt;
*'Nowadays, when you attack [[Catholicism]], nobody cares, right? But when it's about Islam, an entire cordon of people will gather around "the Muslims", thinking they're doing them a service. But I disagree, because things always improve through criticism. And so I think you should be able to subject belief systems to criticism. Liberalism, socialism... you should treat religions the same way we do liberalism. It would be insane if I would say: 'Listen here, I am a ''liberal''! You can't say that about [[John Stuart Mill]], because he provides me with an example!' Or: 'You're now touching my liberal/[[Secular humanism|humanist]] soul!' No, of course not! You shouldn't. You should freely discuss belief systems, because you respect the people who follow them!'&lt;ref name="Buitenhof"/&gt;

A '''persuasive definition''' is a form of [[stipulative definition]] which purports to describe the 'true' or 'commonly accepted' meaning of a term, while in reality stipulating an uncommon or altered use, usually to support an argument for some view, or to create or alter rights, duties or crimes.&lt;ref name=BDWP-per&gt;
{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679517_ss1-72 |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy |title=Persuasive definition  |last=Bunnin |first=Nicholas |first2=Jiyuan|last2= Yu |year=2004 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-0679-5 |accessdate=2012-10-21}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The terms thus defined will often involve emotionally charged but imprecise notions, such as "freedom", "terrorism", "democracy", etc. In [[argumentation]] the use of a persuasive definition is sometimes called ''definist [[fallacy]]''. (The latter sometimes more broadly refers to a fallacy of a definition based on improper identification of two distinct properties.)&lt;ref name=BDWP-deff&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdbxabeToQYC&amp;pg=PA165|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-99721-5|page=165|encyclopedia=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy |title=Definist fallacy |last=Bunnin |first=Nicholas  |first2=Jiyuan|last2= Yu |accessdate=2014-10-15}}

&lt;!--- sources do not agree they are the same, some say there are several kinds of definist fallacies---&gt;

Examples of persuasive definitions (definist fallacies) include: 
* Democrat &amp;ndash; "a leftist who desires to overtax the corporations and abolish freedom in the economic sphere".&lt;ref name="IEP"/&gt;
*"Let's define 'atheist' as someone who doesn't yet realize that God exists."&lt;ref name="IEP2"/&gt;

Persuasive definitions commonly appear in controversial topics such as [[politics]], [[sex]], and [[religion]], as participants in emotionally charged exchanges will sometimes become more concerned about swaying people to one side or another than expressing the unbiased facts. A persuasive definition of a term is favorable to one argument or unfavorable to the other argument, but is presented as if it were neutral and well-accepted, and the listener is expected to accept such a definition without question.&lt;ref name=BDWP-per /&gt;

The term "persuasive definition" was introduced by philosopher [[Charles Stevenson|C.L. Stevenson]] as part of his emotive theory of meaning.{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=82}}

==Overview and example==
Language can simultaneously communicate information (informative) and feelings (expressive).{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=67, 137}} Unlike other common types of definitions in logic, persuasive definitions focus on the expressive use of language to affect the feelings of readers and listeners ultimately with an aim to change their behavior.{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=137}} With this fundamentally different purpose, persuasive definitions are evaluated not on their truth or falsehood but rather on their effectiveness as a persuasive device.{{sfn|Hurley|2008|p=94}} 
Stevenson{{sfn|Stevenson|1937|}} showed how these two dimensions are combined when he investigated the terms he called "ethical" or emotive.{{sfn|Macagno &amp; Walton|2014|}} He noted that some words, such as 'peace' or 'war', are not simply used to describe reality by modifying the cognitive response of the interlocutor. They have also the power of directing the interlocutor's attitudes and suggesting a course of action. For this reason, they evoke a different kind of reaction, emotive in nature. As Stevenson{{sfn|Stevenson|1937|p=18-19}} put it "Instead of merely describing people's interests, they change and intensify them. They recommend an interest in an object, rather than state that the interest already exists." These words have the tendency to encourage future actions, to lead the hearer towards a decision by affecting his or her system of interests.{{sfn|Stevenson|1944|p=210}} Stevenson distinguished between the use of a word (a stimulus) and its possible psychological effects on the addressee's cognitive and the emotive reactions by labeling them as "descriptive meaning" and "emotive meaning".{{sfn|Stevenson|1944|p=54}} Applying this distinction reveals how the redefinition of an ethical word is transformed into an instrument of persuasion, a tool for redirecting preferences and emotions:{{sfn|Stevenson|1944|p=210}}

::Ethical definitions involve a wedding of descriptive and emotive meaning, and accordingly have a frequent use in redirecting and intensifying attitudes. To choose a definition is to plead a cause, so long as the word defined is strongly emotive.

In persuasive definitions the evaluative component associated with a concept is left unaltered while the descriptive meaning is modified. In this fashion, imprisonment can become "true freedom",{{sfn|Huxley|1936|p=122}} and massacres "pacification".{{sfn|Orwell|1946|}} Persuasive definitions can change or distort the meaning while keeping the original evaluations that the use of a word evokes. Quasi-definitions consist in the modification of the emotive meaning of a word without altering the descriptive one. The speaker can quasi-define a word by qualifying the ''definiendum'' without setting forth what the term actually means. For instance, we can consider the following quasi-definition taken from Casanova's Fuga dai Piombi. In this example (1), the speaker, Mr. Soradaci, tries to convince his interlocutor (Casanova) that being a "sneak" is an honorable behavior:{{sfn|Casanova|1911|p=112}}

::I have always despised the prejudice that attaches to the name "spy" a hateful meaning: this name sounds bad only to the ears of who hates the Government. A sneak is just a friend of the good of the State, the plague of the crooks, the faithful servant of his Prince.

This quasi-definition employed in case 1 underscores a fundamental dimension of the "emotive" meaning of a word, namely its relationship with the shared values, which are attacked as "prejudices." This account given by the spy shows how describing the referent based on a different hierarchy of values can modify emotive meaning. The value of trust is not denied, but is placed in a hierarchy where the highest worth is given to the State.{{sfn|Walton &amp; Macagno|2015|}}&lt;p role="presentation"&gt;Stevenson provides us with two definitions of the word culture in order to illustrate what a persuasive definition can accomplish:

*The original definition: "widely read and acquainted with arts"
*The persuasive definition: "imaginative sensitivity"
Both carry with them the positive emotive meaning of culture; it is still a good thing to be cultured no matter which definition is used. What they change is what exactly it means to be called "cultured." Because being cultured is a positive trait, the society views being well read and acquainted with the arts as positive traits to have. By promoting a persuasive definition of "imaginative sensitivity" the society begins to views those qualities positively because they are attached to a word with a positive emotive meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=Charles Leslie|date=1938-01-01|title=Persuasive Definitions|jstor=2250337|journal=Mind|volume=47|issue=187|pages=331–350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unclear, [[figurative language]] is often used in persuasive definitions.{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=154}} Although several techniques can be used to form such a definition,{{sfn|Macagno &amp; Walton|2014|}} the [[genus–differentia definition|genus and difference]] technique is the usual one applied.{{sfn|Hurley|2008|p=103}} Both definitions in the taxation example above agree that the genus is a procedure relating to governance but disagree on the difference. Persuasive definitions combine elements of [[stipulative definition]]s, [[lexical definition]]s, and sometimes [[theoretical definition]]s.{{sfn|Hurley|2008|p=94}}

Persuasive definitions commonly appear in political speeches, [[editorial]]s and other situations where the power to influence is most in demand.{{sfn|Hurley|2008|p=94}} They have been dismissed as serving only to confuse readers and listeners without legitimate purpose.&lt;ref name="Kemerling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophypages.com/lg/e05.htm |title=Definition and Meaning |first=Garth |last=Kemerling |date=2001-10-27 |work=Philosophy Pages |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical scrutiny is often necessary to identify persuasive definitions in an argument as they are meant to appear as honest definitions.{{sfn|Hurley|2008|p=94}}{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|pp=137–138}}{{sfn|Macagno &amp; Walton|2014|}}

[[Image:Quail chick 02.jpg|thumb|right|[[California quail]] chick (''Callipepla californica''), a precocial chick]]

In [[biology]], '''precocial''' species are those in which the young are relatively mature and mobile from the moment of birth or hatching. The opposite developmental strategy is called  "[[altricial]]," where the young are born or hatched helpless. These categories form a continuum, without distinct gaps between them. Precocial species are normally [[nidifugous]], meaning that they leave the nest shortly after birth or hatching.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Aix galericulata -Richmond Park, London, England -mother and ducklings-8.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Mandarin duck]] (''Aix galericulata'') and her ducklings. Like other [[anseriformes]], ducks are precocial animals; within two hours of hatching, the ducklings are normally led to the nearest area of water.]]
The span between precocial and altricial species is particularly broad in [[bird]]s. Precocial birds hatch with their eyes open and are covered with downy feathers that are soon replaced by adult-type feathers.&lt;ref name=creatures&gt;{{cite book |title= Creatures of the Air and Sea|author=Edward S. Brinkley|year= 2000|publisher= Reader's Digest Children's Books|location= Singapore|isbn= 0-7944-0353-0|pages= 34, 35|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds of this kind can also swim and run much sooner after hatching than altricial young, such as songbirds.&lt;ref name=creatures/&gt; Very precocial birds can be ready to leave the nest in a short period of time following hatching (e.g. 24 hours). Many precocial chicks are not independent in [[thermoregulation]] (the ability to regulate their own body temperatures), and they depend on the attending parent(s) to brood them with body heat for a short period of time.  Precocial birds find their own food, sometimes with help or instruction from the parents. Examples of precocial birds include the domestic [[chicken]], many species of [[duck]]s and [[goose|geese]], [[wader]]s, [[rail (bird)|rail]]s, and the [[hoatzin]].

[[File:Foal-three-hours-old.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Horse]]s are known for being precocial, and [[foals]] can walk as fast as their parents within hours.]]
Precociality is found in many other animal groups. Familiar examples of precocial [[mammal]]s are most [[ungulate]]s, the [[guinea pig]], and most species of [[hare]]. This last example is significant as it illustrates that precociality is not a particularly conservative characteristic, in the evolutionary sense, since the closely related [[rabbit]] is highly [[altricial]].

Precocial species typically have a longer [[gestation]] or [[incubate (biology)|incubation]] period than related altricial species, and smaller [[litter (animal)|litter]]s or clutches, since each offspring has to be brought to a relatively advanced (and large) state before birth or hatching.

The phenomenon of [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] studied by [[Konrad Lorenz]] is characteristic of precocial birds.

==Superprecociality==
Extremely precocial species are called "superprecocial". Examples are the [[Megapode]] birds, which have full flight feathers and which, in some species, can fly on the same day they hatch from their eggs.&lt;ref name="Starck&amp;Ricklefs98"&gt;{{cite book |title=Avian Growth and Development. Evolution within the altricial precocial spectrum. |author=Starck, J.M.; Ricklefs, R.E. |year=1998 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=New York |ISBN=0-19-510608-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[blue wildebeest]], whose calves can stand within an average of six minutes from birth and walk within thirty minutes;&lt;ref&gt; Estes, R., and [[E. O. Wilson]] (1992). ''The behavior guide to African mammals: Including hoofed mammals, carnivores, primates''. Los Angeles: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Sinclair, A.R.E., Simon A.R. Mduma, and Peter Arcese (2000). "What determines phenology and synchrony of ungulate breeding in Serengeti?"

''Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie'' 50 (1):45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hopcraft2013wildebeest"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hopcraft, J.G.C.; Sinclair, A.; Holdo, R.M.; Mwangomo, E.; Mduma, S.; Thirgood, S.; Borner, M.; Fryxell, J.M.; Olff, H. |year=2013 |url=http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/science/2010/j.g.c.hopcraft/02_c2.pdf |title=Why are wildebeest the most abundant herbivore in the Serengeti ecosystem? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207015239/http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/science/2010/j.g.c.hopcraft/02_c2.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-07 |journal=Serengeti IV: Sustaining Biodiversity in a Coupled Human – Natural System |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such behavior gives them an advantage over other herbivore species; they are 100 times more abundant in the Serengeti ecosystem than hartebeests, their closest taxonomic relative. [[Hartebeest]] calves are not as precocial as wildebeest calves and take up to thirty minutes or more before they stand, and as long as forty-five minutes before they can follow their mothers for short distances. They are unable to keep up with their mothers until they are more than a week old.&lt;ref name="hopcraft2013wildebeest" /&gt;

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|precocial}}
The word "precocial" is derived from the same root as ''precocious'', implying in both cases early maturity.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary''. David B. Guralnik, Editor in Chief. New York: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phylogeny==
Precociality is thought to be ancestral in birds. Thus, altricial birds tend to be found in the most derived groups. There is some evidence for precociality in [[Protobird]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Andrzej |last1=Elzanowski |first2=Michael K. |last2=Brett-Surman |date=July 1995 |title=Avian Premaxilla and Tarsometatarsus from the Uppermost Cretaceous of Montana |journal=The Auk |volume=112 |issue=3 |pages=762–67 |jstor=4088693}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Troodontid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David J. |last1=Varricchio |first2=John R. |last2=Horner |first3=Frankie D. |last3=Jackson |date=September 19, 2002 |title=Embryos and eggs for the Cretaceous theropod dinosaur ''Troodon formosus'' |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=564–76 |jstor=4524250 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0564:EAEFTC]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Swineshead''' (also '''Suisset''', '''Suiseth''', etc.; fl. c. 1340 – 1354) was an English mathematician, [[logician]], and [[natural philosopher]]. He was perhaps the greatest of the [[Oxford Calculators]] of [[Merton College]], where he was a [[fellow]] certainly by 1344 and possibly by 1340. His magnum opus was a series of treatises known as the ''Liber calculationum'' ("Book of Calculations"), written c. 1350, which earned him the nickname of '''The Calculator'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|1959}}, page 69.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Swineshead, Richard – Calculator, 1520 – BEIC 143141.jpg|thumb|''Calculator'', 1520]]

[[Robert_Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] (d. 1640) wrote in ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' that "[[Julius_Caesar_Scaliger|Scaliger]] and [[Gerolamo_Cardano|Cardan]] admire Suisset the calculator, ''qui pene modum excessit humani ingenii'' [whose talents were almost superhuman]".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Holbrook (ed.) (1932), ''The Anatomy of Melancholy'', i.77 (in "Democritus Junior to the Reader").&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gottfried Leibniz]] wrote in a letter of 1714: "Il y a eu autrefois un Suisse, qui avoit mathématisé dans la Scholastique: ses Ouvrages sont peu connus; mais ce que j'en ai vu m'a paru profond et considérable."  ("There was once a Suisse, who did mathematics belonging to scholasticism; his works are little known, but what I have seen of them seemed to me profound and relevant.")&lt;ref&gt;Letter to M. M. Remond de Montmorency, quoted in Lardet, Pierre (2003) "Les ambitions de Jules–César Scaliger latiniste et philosophe (1484–1558) et sa rèception posthume dans l'aire germanique de Gesner et Schegk à Leibniz et à Kant", in Kessler &amp; Kuhn (edd.), ''Germania latina – Latinitas teutonica'', pp. 157–194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|1959|p=88}}, says the following.
:As late as the end of the seventeenth century the reputation of Calculator was such that Leibniz on several occasions referred to him as almost the first to apply mathematics to physics and as one who introduced mathematics into philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;  Leibniz even had a copy of one of Swineshead's treatises made from an edition in the [[Bibliothèque du Roi]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Duchesneau, François (1998) "Leibniz's Theoretical Shift in the Phoranomus and Dynamica de Potentia", ''Perspectives on Science'' 6, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vladimir Putin]] has served three terms and is currently in a fourth as [[President of Russia]] (2000–2004, 2004–2008, 2012–2018 and May 2018 to present) and was [[Acting President of Russia|Acting President]] from 1999 to 2000, succeeding [[Boris Yeltsin]] after Yeltsin's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McKew|first1=Molly K.|title=Putin's Real Long Game|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/putins-real-long-game-214589|accessdate=30 January 2017|work=Politico Magazine|date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putin was also [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] for three months in 1999 and served a full term from 2008 to 2012.

The political system under Putin has been described as incorporating some elements of [[economic liberalism]], a lack of [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] in governance, [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]] and pervasive [[Political corruption|corruption]].

In September 2007, American economist [[Richard W.

Russian historian [[Andranik Migranyan]] saw the Putin regime as restoring what he viewed as the natural functions of a government after period of the 1990s, when [[Oligopoly|oligopolies]] expressing only their own narrow interests allegedly ruled Russia. Migranyan said: "If democracy is the rule by a majority and the protection of the rights and opportunities of a minority, the current political regime can be described as democratic, at least formally. A multiparty political system exists in Russia, while several parties, most of them representing the opposition, have seats in the [[State Duma]]".&lt;ref name=Andranik/&gt;

Cassiday and Johnson argue that since taking power in 1999, "Putin has inspired expressions of adulation the likes of which Russia has not seen since the days of [[Stalin]].

== Putin's campaign program ==
On 31 December 1999, President [[Boris Yeltsin]] resigned. Under the Constitution of Russia, the then Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin became Acting President.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/585368.stm Putin takes control in Russia], BBC news, December 31, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The day before, a program article signed by Putin "Russia at the turn of the millennium" was published on the government web site. The potential head of the state expressed his views on the past and problems of the country.&lt;ref&gt;"The document was prepared by members of Gref’s Centre for Strategic Studies, but we know that Putin carefully went through the draft and added his own comments and corrections. The document thus provides a genuine insight into his thinking", ''Richard Sakwa, "Putin: Russia's choice", page 52''&lt;/ref&gt; The first task in Putin's view was consolidation of Russia's society: "The fruitful and creative work, which our country needs so badly, is impossible in a divided and internally atomised society".&lt;ref name=put1&gt;[http://www.ng.ru/politics/1999-12-30/4_millenium.html Russia between the Millennia], Vladimir Putin (in Russian). The English translation cited per the Appendix of Richard Sakwa's "Putin: Russia's choice"&lt;/ref&gt; However, the author stressed: "There should be no forced civil accord in a democratic Russia. Social accord can only be voluntary".&lt;ref name=put1 /&gt;

The author stressed the importance of strengthening the state: "The key to Russia’s recovery and growth today lies in the state-political sphere. Russia needs strong state power and must have it". Detailing on his view Putin emphasized: "Strong state power in Russia is a democratic, law-based, workable federal state".&lt;ref name=put1 /&gt;

Regarding the economic problems, Putin pointed out the need to significantly improve economic efficiency, the need of carrying out the coherent and result-based social policy aimed to battle the poverty and the need to provide the stable growth of people's well-being.&lt;ref name=put1 /&gt;

The article stated the importance of government support of science, education, culture, health care since "[a] country in which the people are not healthy physically and psychologically, are poorly educated and illiterate, will never rise to the peaks of world civilisation".&lt;ref name=put1 /&gt;

The article concluded with an alarmist statement that Russia was in the midst of one of the most difficult periods in its history: "For the first time in the past 200–300 years, it is facing the real threat of slipping down to the second, and possibly even third, rank of world states".&lt;ref name=put1 /&gt; To avoid that, there's a need of tremendous effort of all the intellectual, physical and moral forces of the nation because "[e]verything depends on us, and us alone, on our ability to recognise the scale of the threat, to unite and apply ourselves to lengthy and hard work".&lt;ref name=put1 /&gt;

As stated in the history course by Russian Doctors of History Barsenkov and Vdovin, the basic ideas of the article were represented in the election platform of Vladimir Putin and supported by the majority of country's citizens, leading to the victory of Vladimir Putin in the first round of the [[Russian presidential election, 2000|2000 election]], with 52 per cent of the votes cast.&lt;ref name=bars&gt;[http://www.alleng.ru/d/hist/hist035.htm ''History of Russia, 1917–2004''], A.S. Barsenkov ([[:ru:Барсенков, Александр Сергеевич|RuWiki]]) and A.I. Vdovin, page 765. (book in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The outline of Russia's foreign policy was presented by Vladimir Putin in his Address to Russia's Federal Assembly in April 2002: "We are building constructive, normal relations with all the world's nations—I want to emphasise, with all the world's nations. However, I want to note something else: the norm in the international community, in the world today, is also harsh competition—for markets, for investment, for political and economic influence. And in this fight, Russia needs to be strong and competitive". "I want to stress that Russian foreign policy will in the future be organized in a strictly pragmatic way, based on our capabilities and national interests: military and strategic, economic and political. And also taking into account the interests of our partners, above all in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2002/04/18/0000_type70029type82912_70662.shtml Annual Address to the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226024418/http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2002/04/18/0000_type70029type82912_70662.shtml |date=2009-02-26 }}, Vladimir Putin, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2008 book, the Russian political commentator, the retired KGB [[lieutenant-general]] [[Nikolai Leonov]], noted that Putin's program article was barely noticed then and never revisited later—a fact that Leonov regretted, because "its content is most important for contrasting against his [Putin's] subsequent actions" and thus figuring out Putin's pattern, under which "words, more often than not, do not match his actions".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolai Leonov|Н.С. Леонов]]. ''Россия 2000–2008. Закат или рассвет?'' (''Russia 2000–2008. Sunset, or Dawn?''), Moscow, 2008, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociological data ==
According to Dr. Mark Smith (March 2003), some of the main features of Putin's regime were the development of a corporatist system by pursuing close ties with business organizations, social stability and co-optation of opposition parties.&lt;ref name="marksmith" /&gt; He determined three main groupings in Putin's early leadership: 1) the ''siloviki'', 2) economic liberals and 3) supporters of "the Family", i.e. those who were close to Yeltsin.&lt;ref name="marksmith" /&gt;

Olga Kryshtanovskaya, who carried out a sociological survey in 2004, put the relative number of ''siloviki'' in the Russian political elite at 25%.&lt;ref name=Krysha&gt;[http://2004.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2004/63n/n63n-s43.shtml Mission "intrusion" is complete!] by Olga Kryshtanovskaya, 2004, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; In Putin's "inner circle" which constitutes about 20 people, amount of ''siloviki'' rises to 58% and fades to 18–20% in parliament and 34% in the government.&lt;ref name=Krysha /&gt; According to Kryshtanovskaya, there was no capture of power as Kremlin bureaucracy has called siloviks in order to "restore order". The process of ''siloviki'' coming into power has allegedly started since 1996, [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s second term. "Not personally Yeltsin, but the whole elite wished to stop the revolutionary process and consolidate the power". When ''silovik'' Putin was appointed Prime Minister in 1999, the process boosted. According to Olga: "Yes, Putin has brought siloviks with him. But that's not enough to understand the situation. Here's also an objective aspect: the whole political class wished them to come. They were called for service... There was a need of a strong arm, capable from point of view of the elite to establish order in the country".&lt;ref name=Krysha /&gt;

Kryshtanovskaya noted that there were also people who had worked in structures believed to be affiliated with the [[KGB]]/[[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]], such as the Soviet Union [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], Governmental Communications Commission, [[Foreign trade of the Soviet Union|Ministry of Foreign Trade]], Press Agency ''News'' and others. The work ''per se'' in such agencies would not necessarily involve contacts with security services, but would make it likely.&lt;ref name=Krysha2&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.cprf.info/projects/vlast/22071.shtml Fradkov: jacket over straps], by Olga Kryshtanovskaya ([[Moscow News]], May 3, 2004, № 8)&lt;/ref&gt; Summing up the numbers of official and affiliated ''siloviki'', she came up with an estimate of 77% of such in the power.&lt;ref name=Krysha /&gt;

According to a Russian Public Opinion Foundation 2005 investigation, 34% of respondents think "there is a lack of democracy in Russia because democratic rights and freedoms are not observed" and also point on the lack of law and order. In the same time, 21% of respondents are sure there's too much of democracy in Russia and many of them point on the same drawbacks as the previous group: "[T]he lack of law and order, irresponsibility and non-accountability of politicians". According to the Foundation: "As we can see, Russians' negative opinions about democracy are based on their dissatisfaction with contemporary conditions, while some respondents think the democratic model is not suitable in principal". Considering the modern regime: "It is interesting that most respondents think Putin's government marks the most democratic epoch in Russian history (29%), while second place goes to Brezhnev's times (14%). Some people mentioned Gorbachev and Yeltsin in this context (11% and 9%, respectively)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://bd.english.fom.ru/report/map/ed051325 Democracy in Russia (population poll)]{{dead link|date=August 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, by the [[Public Opinion Foundation]], March 2005.

At the end of 2008, [[Lev Gudkov]], based on the [[Levada Center]] polling data, pointed out the near-disappearance of [[public opinion]] as a socio-political institution in Putin's Russia and its replacement with the still-efficacious state propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml?2008/12/30/176062 |script-title=ru:Новогодний баланс: После стабильности |publisher=[[Vedomosti]]|date=December 30, 2008|accessdate=2008-12-31|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic policies ==
On 9 July 2000 while speaking to the Russian Parliament, Putin advocated an economy policy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-536806.html Putin Advocates Strong Russia, Liberal Economy; President Surprisingly Candid In First State of Nation Address]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would have introduced a [[flat tax]] rate of 13%&lt;ref name="heritage"&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/press/commentary/ed032403.cfm Russia's Flat-Tax Miracle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206124146/http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed032403.cfm |date=2009-02-06 }} March 24, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 24 percent.&lt;ref name="heritage" /&gt; Putin also intended for small businesses to get better treatment under this economic reform package. Under Putin, the old system which included high tax rates has been replaced with a new system where companies can choose either a 6 percent tax on gross revenue or a 15 percent tax on profits.&lt;ref name="heritage" /&gt;

In February 2009, Putin called for a single [[VAT]] rate to be "as low as possible" (at the time it stood at an average rate of 18 percent), which could be reduced to between 12 percent and 13 percent.&lt;ref name="iht_lowertaxes"&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/02/08/business/rustax.php Putin calls for lower taxes to spur business growth] [[International Herald Tribune]] February 8, 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211041604/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/02/08/business/rustax.php |date=February 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall tax burden was lower in Russia under Putin than in most European countries.&lt;ref name="taxcompare"&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=526745 |title=A Comparative Study of Taxation in Russia and Other CIS, East European and OECD Countries |doi=10.2139/ssrn.526745 |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date=2004-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rising living standards ==
In 2005, Putin launched [[National Priority Projects]] in the fields of [[Health care in Russia|health care]], [[Education in Russia|education]], housing and [[Agriculture in Russia|agriculture]]. In his May 2006 annual speech, Putin proposed increasing maternity benefits and [[prenatal care]] for women. Putin was strident about the need to reform the judiciary considering the present federal judiciary "Sovietesque", wherein many of the judges hand down the same verdicts as they would under the old Soviet judiciary structure and preferring instead a judiciary that interpreted and implemented the code to the current situation. In 2005, responsibility for federal prisons was transferred from the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] to the [[Ministry of Justice (Russia)|Ministry of Justice]].

The most high-profile change within the national priority project frameworks was probably the 2006 across-the-board increase in wages in healthcare and education as well as the decision to modernise equipment in both sectors in 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref name="bofit"&gt;[http://www.bof.fi/NR/rdonlyres/C02B01A1-7210-472C-87C7-ABAF303168F7/0/bon0608.pdf The challenges of the Medvedev era, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113153601/http://www.bof.fi/NR/rdonlyres/C02B01A1-7210-472C-87C7-ABAF303168F7/0/bon0608.pdf |date=November 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Putin's government, poverty was cut more than half&lt;ref name="kommersantstats" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stats" /&gt; and [[Real GDP#Types of GDP and GDP growth|real GDP]] has grown rapidly.&lt;ref name="news.xinhuanet.com" /&gt;

In 2006, chief of ''[[Business Week]]''{{'}}s Moscow bureau [[Jason Bush]] commented on the condition of Russian middle class: "This group has grown from just 8 million in 2000 to 55 million today and now accounts for some 37% of the population, estimates Expert, a market research firm in Moscow. That's giving a lift to the mood in the country. The share of Russians who think life is 'not bad' has risen to 23% from just 7% in 1999, while those who find living conditions 'unacceptable' has dropped to 29% from 53%, according to a recent poll". However, "[n]ot everyone has shared in the prosperity. Far from it. The average Russian earns $330 a month, just 10% of the U.S. average. Only a third of households own a car, and many—particularly the elderly—have been left behind".&lt;ref name="Bush" /&gt;

At the end of Putin's second term, [[Jonathan Steele]] has commented on Putin's legacy: "What, then, is Putin's legacy? Stability and growth, for starters. After the chaos of the 90s, highlighted by Yeltsin's attack on the Russian parliament with tanks in 1993 and the collapse of almost every bank in 1998, Putin has delivered political calm and a 7% annual rate of growth. Inequalities have increased and many of the new rich are grotesquely crass and cruel, but not all the Kremlin's vast revenues from oil and gas have gone into private pockets or are being hoarded in the government's "stabilisation fund". Enough has gone into modernising schools and hospitals so that people notice a difference. Overall living standards are up. The second Chechen war, the major blight on Putin's record, is almost over".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,2171416,00.html Putin's legacy is a Russia that doesn't have to curry favour with the west], by [[Jonathan Steele]], ''Guardian'', September 18, 1007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporatism and state intervention in economy ==
According to Dr Mark Smith (March 2003), Putin's regime had developed a "[[corporatism|corporatist system]]" in the sense that under him the Kremlin was interested in close ties with business organizations such as the [[Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs]], [[Delovaya Rossiya]] and the trade union federation (FNPR).&lt;ref name="marksmith"&gt;[http://www.da.mod.uk/colleges/arag/document-listings/russian/E111 The Putinite System] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418125150/http://www.da.mod.uk/colleges/arag/document-listings/russian/E111 |date=2009-04-18 }} Dr. Mark A. Smith&lt;/ref&gt; This was a part of the regime's attempts to involve broad sectors of society in the making and implementation of policy.&lt;ref name="marksmith" /&gt;

There is a school of thought which says that a number of Putin's steps in the economy (notably the fate of [[Yukos]]) were signs of a shift toward a system normally described as [[state capitalism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/gvosdev200311050739.asp ''Putin’s Gamble.

According to [[Andrey Illarionov]], advisor of Putin until 2005, Putin's regime was a new socio-political order "distinct from any seen in our country before" as members of the Corporation of Intelligence Service Collaborators had taken over the entire body of state power, followed an ''[[omertà]]''-like behavior code and were "given instruments conferring power upon others—membership "perks", such as the right to carry and use weapons". According to Illarionov, this "Corporation has seized key government agencies—the Tax Service, [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Ministry of Defense]], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], [[Duma|Parliament]], and the [[Media freedom in Russia|government-controlled mass media]]—which are now used to advance the interests of [Corporation] members. Through those agencies, every significant resource in the country—security/intelligence, political, economic, informational and financial—is being monopolized in the hands of Corporation members".&lt;ref name="Illarionov"&gt;{{cite web|first=James|last=Kimer|title=Andrei Illarionov: Approaching Zimbabwe|publisher=[[Robert Amsterdam]]|url=http://robertamsterdam.com/andrei_illarionov_approaching_zimbabwe/|date=25 April 2007|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Corporation formed an isolated [[caste]] and according to an anonymous former KGB general cited by ''[[The Economist]]'', “[a] Chekist is a breed ... A good KGB heritage—a father or grandfather, say, who worked for the service—is highly valued by today's [[silovik]]i. Marriages between siloviki clans are also encouraged.&lt;ref name="Neo-KGB"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9682621 "Russia under Putin. The making of a neo-KGB state"], ''The Economist'', August 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Jason Bush, chief of the Moscow bureau of the magazine ''Business Week'' has commented in December 2006 on troubling growth of government's role: "The Kremlin has taken control of some two dozen Russian companies since 2004, including oil assets from Sibneft and Yukos, as well as banks, newspapers, and more. Despite his sporadic support for pro-market reforms, Putin has backed national champions such as energy concerns Gazprom and Rosneft. The private sector's share of output fell from 70% to 65% last year, while state-controlled companies now represent 38% of stock market capitalization, up from 22% a year ago".&lt;ref name="Bush"&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/dec2006/gb20061207_520461.htm "Russia: How Long Can The Fun Last?"], by [[Jason Bush]], ''[[Business Week]]'', December 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 September 2008 and when the [[Great Recession|late 2000s recession]] had started to hit the well-being of Russia's top tycoons, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' said that "Putinism was built on the understanding that if tycoons played by Kremlin rules they would prosper".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/9d1cffd0-8624-11dd-959e-0000779fd18c.html|title=Russian lessons|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=September 20, 2008|accessdate=2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Russia's state intervention in the economy had been usually criticized in the West, a study by Bank of Finland's Institute for Economies in Transition (BOFIT) in 2008 showed that state intervention had had a positive impact on the [[corporate governance]] of many companies in Russia as the formal indications of the quality of corporate governance in Russia were higher in companies with state control or with a stake held by the government.&lt;ref name="yakovlev"&gt;[http://www.bof.fi/NR/rdonlyres/3B399E29-C7A5-41A6-B22F-07C9C3E61E72/0/dp2608.pdf Andrei Yakovlev, State-business relations and improvement of corporate governance in Russia] Bank of Finland Institute for Economies in Transition, 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205110744/http://www.bof.fi/NR/rdonlyres/3B399E29-C7A5-41A6-B22F-07C9C3E61E72/0/dp2608.pdf |date=February 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other economic developments and assessments ==
In June 2008, a group of [[Finland|Finnish]] economists wrote that the 2000s had so far been an economic boon for Russia, with GDP rising about 7% a year and by the beginning of 2008 Russia had become one of the ten largest economies in the world.&lt;ref name="challenges_of_medv_era" /&gt;

In Putin's first term, many new economic reforms were implemented along the lines of the "Gref program". The multitude of reforms ranged from a flat income tax to bank reform, from land ownership to improvements in conditions for small businesses.&lt;ref name="challenges_of_medv_era" /&gt;

In 1998, over 60% of industrial turnover in Russia was based on barter and various monetary surrogates. The use of such alternatives to money now today fallen out of favour, which has boosted economic productivity significantly. Besides raising wages and consumption, Putin's government has received broad praise also for eliminating this problem.&lt;ref name="challenges_of_medv_era"&gt;[http://www.bof.fi/NR/rdonlyres/C02B01A1-7210-472C-87C7-ABAF303168F7/0/bon0608.pdf Korhonen et at, The challenges of the Medvedev era] Bank of Finland's Institute for Economies in Transition, 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113153601/http://www.bof.fi/NR/rdonlyres/C02B01A1-7210-472C-87C7-ABAF303168F7/0/bon0608.pdf |date=November 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of the Finnish researchers, the most high-profile change within the national priority project frameworks was probably the 2006 across-the-board increase in wages in healthcare and education as well as the decision to modernise equipment in both sectors in 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref name="challenges_of_medv_era" /&gt;

The rise in the overall living standards further deepened Russia's social and geographical discrepancies. In July 2008, [[Edward Lucas (journalist)|Edward Lucas]] of ''The Economist'' wrote: "The colossal bribe-collecting opportunities created by Putinism have heightened the divide between big cities (particularly Moscow) and the rest of the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Edward|last=Lucas|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11784695|title=For your freedom and ours

In November 2008, the retired KGB [[lieutenant-general]] [[Nikolai Leonov]], in assessing the overall results of Putin's economic policies for the period of 8 years, said that [w]ithin this period, there has only been one positive thing, if you leave aside the trivia. And that thing is the price of oil and natural gas".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russdom.ru/node/49 Генерал КГБ Н.С.Леонов: "В нашей стране умеют только пилить бабки"] KGB [[lieutenant-general]] [[Nikolai Leonov]]'s interview, November 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the closing paragraphs of his 2008 book, the retired general said: "Behind the gilded facade of Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]], there lies a demolished country that, under the current characteristics of those in power, has no chance to restore itself as one of the developed states of the world".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolai Leonov|Н.С.

On 29 November 2008, [[Gennady Zyuganov]], leader of the [[Communist Party of Russian Federation]] (the largest opposition group within Russia with its 13% of seats in the [[Duma|national Parliament]]), in his speech before the 13th Party Congress lamented that due to "heroic efforts" of the "Yeltsinites" the country has lost 5 out of the 22 million square kilometers of its "historical territory" and that Russia faces de-industrialization, de-population and mental debilitation. The ruling group has in his opinion no notable successes to boast of, no clear plan of action and is only focussed on staying in power at all costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kprf.ru/party_live/61739.html Political Report of the CPRF Central Committee to the 13th Party Congress], by G.Zyuganov, November 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

To characterize the kind of state Putin had built in socio-economic terms, in early 2008 professor [[Marshall Goldman|Marshall I. Goldman]] coined the term "petrostate" in ''Petrostate: Putin, Power, and the New Russia'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Goldman|Marshall I. Goldman]]. ''Petrostate: Putin, Power, and the New Russia'', Oxford University Press, May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; where he ''inter alia'' argued that while Putin had followed the advice of economic advisers in implementing reforms such as a 13 percent flat tax and creating a stabilization fund to lessen inflationary pressure, his main personal contribution was the idea of creating "national champions" and the renationalization of major energy assets. In his June 2008 interview, Marshall Goldman said that in his opinion Putin had created a new class of oligarchs, whom some called "silogarchs", Russia having come in second in the [[Forbes|''Forbes'' magazine]] list of the world's billionaires after only the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cceia.org/resources/transcripts/0047.html Petrostate: Putin, Power, and the New Russia] [[Carnegie Council]] Marshall I.

In December 2008, [[Anders Åslund]] pointed out that Putin’s chief project had been "to develop huge, unmanageable state-owned mastodons, considered “national champions”", which had "stalemated large parts of the economy through their inertia and corruption while impeding diversification".&lt;ref name="AAsl"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Anders Åslund]]|url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=27959 |title=Crisis Puts Putinomics to the Test|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=29 December 2008 |accessdate=2009-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoring functionality of government ==
The concept of "Putinism" was described in a positive sense by Russian [[political scientist]] [[Andranik Migranyan]].&lt;ref name=Andranik&gt;[http://eng.globalaffairs.ru/numbers/7/521.html What is ‘Putinism’?], by Andranik Migranyan, ''Russia in Global affairs'', 13 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; According to Migranyan, Putin came into office when the worst regime was established: the economy was "totally decentralized" and "the state had lost central authority while the [[oligarchy|oligarchs]] robbed the country and controlled its power institutions". In two years, Putin has restored hierarchy of power, ending the omnipotence of regional elites as well as destroying political influence of "oligarchs and oligopolies in the federal center".  [[Boris Yeltsin]]-era non-institutional center of power commonly called "The Family" was ruined, which according to Migranyan in turn undercut the positions of the actors such as [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]] and [[Vladimir Gusinsky]], who had sought to privatize the Russian state "with all of its resources and institutions".&lt;ref name=Andranik /&gt;

Migranyan said that Putin began establishing common rules of the game for all actors and started with an attempt to restore the role of the government as the institution expressing combined interests of the citizens and "capable of controlling the state’s financial, administrative and media resources". According to Migranyan: "Naturally, in line with Russian traditions, any attempt to increase the state’s role causes an intense repulsion on the part of the liberal intellectuals, not to mention a segment of the business community that is not interested in the strengthening of state power until all of the most attractive state property has been seized". Migranyan claimed that oligopolies' view of democracy was set on a premise of whether they were close to the center of power, rather than "objective characteristics and estimates of the situation in the country". Migranyan said "free" media, owned by e.g. Berezovsky and Gusinsky, were nothing similar to free media as understood by the West, but served their only economic and political interests while "all other politicians and analysts were denied the right to go on the air".&lt;ref name=Andranik /&gt;

Migranyan sees enhancement of the role of the law enforcement agencies as a trial to set barriers against criminals, "particularly those in big business".&lt;ref name=Andranik /&gt;

Migranyan sees in 2004 fruition of the social revolution initiated by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], whose aims were to rebuild the social system, saying that "the absolute dominance of private ownership in Russia, recognized by all political forces today, has been the greatest achievement and result of this social revolution".&lt;ref name=Andranik /&gt;

According to Migranyan, the major trouble of Russian democracy is inability of civil society to rule the state, underdevelopment of public interests. He sees that as the consequence of Yeltsin's era family-ruled state being unable to pursue "a favorable environment for mid-sized and small businesses". Migranyan sees modern Russia as democracy, at least formally. While "the state, having restored its effectiveness and control over its own resources, has become the largest corporation responsible for establishing the rules of the game". Migranyan wonders how much might this influence extend in future. In 2004, he saw two possibilities for the Putin regime: either transformation into a consolidated democracy, either bureaucratic authoritarianism. However, "if Russia is lagging behind the developed capitalist nations in regard to the consolidation of democracy, it is not the quality of democracy, but rather its amount and the balance between civil society and the state".&lt;ref name=Andranik /&gt;

The report by [[Andrew Kuchins|Andrew C. Kuchins]] in November 2007 said that "Russia today is a hybrid regime that might best be termed “illiberal internationalism”, although neither word is fully accurate and requires considerable qualification. From being a weakly institutionalized, fragile, and in many ways distorted proto-democracy in the 1990s, Russia under Vladimir Putin has moved back in the direction of a highly centralized authoritarianism, which has characterized the state for most of its 1,000-year history. But it is an authoritarian state where the [[consent of the governed]] is essential. Given the experience of the 1990s and the Kremlin’s propaganda emphasizing this period as one of chaos, economic collapse, and international humiliation, the Russian people have no great enthusiasm for democracy and remain politically apathetic in light of the extraordinary economic recovery and improvement in lifestyles for so many over the last eight years. The emergent, highly centralized government, combined with a weak and submissive society, is the hallmark of traditional Russian paternalism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csis.org/media/csis/pubs/071214-russia_2017-web.pdf "Alternative Futures for Russia to 2017"]. A report of the Russia and Eurasia Program [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] November 2007, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] commented on the Putin regime: "Putin has inherited plundered and downtrodden country with demoralized and grown poor majority of the population. And he took on its possible — to be noted, gradual, slow — recovering. These efforts were not right at the moment noticed, not speaking about being appreciated. And can you point on examples in history when measures for recovering strength of governmental management would be benevolently met from beyond the country?".&lt;ref name=Solj&gt;Interview of ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' with [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], July 23, 2007: [http://www.izvestia.ru/person/article3106464/ Russian translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111082823/http://www.izvestia.ru/person/article3106464/ |date=2007-11-11 }}, [http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/literatur/0,1518,496046,00.html partial German version], [http://service.spiegel.de/digas/find?DID=52345037 full German version (paid)].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2007 article of [[Dimitri Simes]] published in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]:'' "With high energy prices, sound fiscal policies, and tamed oligarchs, the Putin regime no longer needs international loans or economic assistance and has no trouble attracting major foreign investment despite growing tension with Western governments. Within Russia, relative stability, prosperity, and a new sense of dignity have tempered popular disillusionment with growing state control and the heavy-handed manipulation of the political process".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/10/losing_russia.html Losing Russia], originally printed in Foreign Affairs, by Dimitri Simes, November/December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BBC]] diplomatic correspondent [[Bridget Kendall]] in her 2007 article and after describing the "scarred decade" of the 1990s with "rampant [[hyperinflation]]" harsh Yeltsin's policies, population decrease rate like that for a nation in a war, the country turning "from [[superpower]] into beggar", wonders: "So who can blame Russians for welcoming the relative stability Putin has presided over during the past seven years, even if other aspects of his rule have cast an authoritarian shadow? In the back-to-front world of Russian politics, it is not too little democracy that many people fear, but too much of it. This, I discovered, is why some are calling for Putin to stay on for a third term. Not because they admire him—privately, many say that he and his cronies are just as corrupt and disdainful of others as their communist predecessors were—but because they mistrust the idea of democracy, resent the West for pushing it, and fear what might happen as a result of next year's elections. Recent experience has taught them that change is usually for the worse and best avoided".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200706110024 Russia: The beggar becomes the belligerent], by [[Bridget Kendall]], ''[[New Statesman]]'', June 7, 2007 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723231031/http://www.newstatesman.com/200706110024|date=July 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2000, Putin's decree was approved by the "Concept of the Russian Federation's foreign policy". According to this document, the main objectives of foreign policy are the following:
*Ensuring reliable security of the country.
*The impact of global processes in order to create a stable, just and democratic world order.
*The creation of favorable external conditions for the onward development of Russian.
*Formation of the Neighbourhood zone around the perimeter of the Russian borders.
*Search agreement and coinciding interests with foreign countries and international associations in the process of solving problems, Russia's national priorities.
*Protecting the rights and interests of Russian citizens and compatriots abroad.
*Promote a positive perception of the Russian Federation in the world.

In a 2010 article in the German newspaper ''[[Sueddeutsche Zeitung]]'' dedicated to the participation in the annual economic forum it was proposed to create a European economic alliance stretching from [[Vladivostok]] to [[Lisbon]]. As steps towards the creation of the alliance indicates a possible unification of customs tariffs and technical regulations, the abolition of the visa regime with the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2010/11/25/wirtschaft/|title=Putin proposed European economic alliance from Vladivostok to Lisbon|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, according to experts the Russian-American relations have reached their lowest point since the end of the [[Cold War]] era. The September President [[Barack Obama]]'s visit to [[Moscow]] and his talks with Putin were canceled due to temporary asylum in Russia, a former employee of the [[CIA]] [[Edward Snowden]], disagreements on the [[Syrian Civil War|situation in Syria]] and the problems with human rights in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2013/08/10_a_5548849.shtml|title=Obama explained why refused to meet with Putin|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 September 2013, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article by Putin "Russia calls for caution". It is written in the form of an open letter to the American people, containing an explanation of the Russian political line against the Syrian conflict. It is also the Russian president warns against President Obama's thesis "About the exclusivity of the American nation". The article caused a mixed reaction of the world community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax.ru/world/328890|title=McCain wants to respond to Putin|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://russian.rt.com/article/15436|title=Putin's article in New York Times caused a resonance in the global community|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Putin won the first place in the annual ranking of most influential people in the world by ''[[Forbes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinehoward/2013/10/30/the-worlds-most-powerful-people-2013/#78a23bad5ed1|title=The World's Most Powerful People 2013|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the result of repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinehoward/2014/11/05/ranking-the-worlds-most-powerful-people-2014/#6df3f26c5e87|title=The World's Most Powerful People 2014|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Putin spoke for the first time in 10 years at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] session in [[New York City]]. In his speech, he urged to form a broad anti-terrorist coalition to combat [[ISIS]] and blamed the [[War in Donbass|events in Ukraine]] on "external forces", warned the West against unilateral sanctions, attempts to push Russia from the world market and export of [[color revolutions]]. For the first time, he also held a meeting with President Obama for two years to discuss the situation in [[Syria]] and [[Ukraine]], but in the outcome of the negotiations and despite the persistence of deep contradictions the experts saw a faint hope for a compromise and the warming of relations between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbc.ru/politics/29/09/2015/560a97849a7947d6af019635|title=Syrian Party: Putin's initiative as the West reacted to the UN|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Authoritarian bureaucratic state ==
Russian politician [[Boris Nemtsov]] and commentator [[Vladimir V. Kara-Murza|Kara-Murza]] define Putinism in Russia as "a [[One-party state|one party system]], [[censorship]], a [[State Duma|puppet parliament]], ending of an independent judiciary, firm centralization of power and finances, and hypertrophied role of [[FSB (Russia)|special services]] and [[vertical of power|bureaucracy]], in particular in relation to business".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defac.ac.uk/colleges/csrc/document-listings/russian/04(01)-MAS.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231555/http://www.defac.ac.uk/colleges/csrc/document-listings/russian/04(01)-MAS.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 September 2007|title=404 Error Page|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia's nascent [[middle class]] showed few signs of political activism under the regime as [[Masha Lipman]] reported: "As with the majority overall, those in the middle-income group have accepted the paternalism of Vladimir Putin's government and remained apolitical and apathetic".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/03/AR2007060300950_pf.html "Russia's Apolitical Middle"], by Masha Lipman, ''[[Washington Post]]'', June 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, the Russian sociologist Igor Eidman ([[VCIOM]]) categorized the Putin regime as "the power of bureaucratic [[oligarchy]]" which had "the traits of extreme right-wing dictatorship — the dominance of [[State monopoly capitalism|state-monopoly]] capital in the economy, ''silovoki'' structures in governance, [[clericalism]] and [[statism]] in ideology".&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://vremya.ru/2007/230/4/194002.html Популяры вместо оптиматов. Оппозиция в России может быть только новой и левой.] [[Vremya Novostei]] № 230 14 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, ''The Economist'' wrote about the virtual demise of both Russian and Soviet [[intelligentsia]] in post-Soviet Russia and noted: "Putinism was made strong by the absence of resistance from the part of society that was meant to provide intellectual opposition".&lt;ref name="IntellEc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11880594|title=Russian intellectuals. The hand that feeds them |work=The Economist|date=7 February 2008|accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early February 2009, [[Aleksander Auzan]], an economist and board member at a research institute set up by [[Dmitry Medvedev]], said that in the Putin system "there is not a relationship between the authorities and the people through Parliament or through nonprofit organizations or other structures. The relationship to the people is basically through [[Television in Russia|television]]. And under the conditions of the crisis, that can no longer work".&lt;ref name="Hardtimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/02/01/europe/putin.4-420610.php |title=Hard times in Russia spell trouble for Putin |work=The International Herald Tribune |date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203234102/http://iht.com/articles/2009/02/01/europe/putin.4-420610.php |archivedate=February 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the same time, [[Vladimir Ryzhkov]] pointed out that a bill Medvedev had sent to the [[State Duma]] in late January 2009, when signed into law, will allow Kremlin-friendly regional legislatures to remove opposition mayors who were elected by popular vote: "It is no coincidence that Medvedev has taken aim at the country's mayors. Mayoral elections were the last bastion of direct elections after the Duma cancelled the popular vote for governors in 2005. Independent mayors were the only source of political competition against governors who were loyal to the Kremlin and United Russia. Now one of the few remaining checks and balances against the monopoly on executive power in the regions will be removed. After the law is signed by Medvedev, the power vertical will be extended one step further to reach every mayor in the country".&lt;ref name="RyzhMT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/1016/42/374171.htm |title=Medvedev the Sham Liberal |work=[[The Moscow Times]] |date=3 February 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208021809/http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/1016/42/374171.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rehabilitation of the Tsarist imperial and of the Soviet past of Russia ==

=== Tsarist Imperial Russia ===
It is claimed that Putin models himself on the [[Tsar]] [[Peter the Great]], whose reign is reminiscent of a Russian imperial greatness which the Kremlin is keen to promote. A presidential commission asked Putin in 2003 to grant the request of one of [[Nicholas II]]'s last surviving relatives to rehabilitate the [[House of Romanov]].&lt;ref name="Romanov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/dec/20/russia.nickpatonwalsh|title=Presidential commission says it has evidence which will absolve Nicholas II of crimes and rehabilitate the last tsarist family|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 December 2002|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willing to regain the imperial grandeur of Russia, Putin invited the Romanov royal family to return to Russia in July 2015.&lt;ref name="DN"&gt;{{pt}} {{cite web|url=https://www.dn.pt/inicio/pessoas/interior.aspx?content_id=4690935|title=Rússia quer trazer de novo os Romanov e voltar a ser o país dos czares (Russia wants to bring back the Romanovs and wants to become again the country of the Tsars.)|publisher=[[Diário de Notícias]]|date=21 July 2015|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the presidential commission, this move would represent a significant final step in Russia's journey to embrace its [[Russian Empire|imperial]] history.&lt;ref name="Romanov"/&gt;

An alliance has been forged between the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Church]] and the Kremlin since Putin became President of the Russian Federation. An adherent of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], Putin has allowed the regaining by the Orthodox Church of much of the importance that the Church had enjoyed in the Russian Empire and has won the enthusiastic support of its religious leaders.&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox Church"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1579638/Orthodox-Church-unholy-alliance-with-Putin.html|title=Orthodox Church unholy alliance with Putin|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]|date=23 February 2008|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soviet Union ===
The first politically controversial step made by Putin, then the FSB Director, was restoring in June 1999 a memorial plaque to [[Yuri Andropov]] on the facade of the building, where the KGB had been headquartered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/8260-14.cfm Andropov's Legacy in Putin's Foreign Policy] [[The Jamestown Foundation]] Jun 18, 2004. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212120251/http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/8260-14.cfm |date=February 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2000, Putin submitted a bill to the State Duma to use the [[National Anthem of the Soviet Union|Soviet anthem]] as Russia's national anthem. The Duma voted in favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sputniknews.com/russia/20130313/179993626.html |title=Russia Marks Soviet Poet Mikhalkov’s 100th Anniversary |accessdate=23 December 2014 |date=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music remained identical, but new lyrics were written.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In April 2005 during his formal address to Russia's [[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Parliament]], President Putin said: "Above all, we should acknowledge that the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] was a major geopolitical disaster of the century. As for the Russian nation, it became a genuine drama. Tens of millions of our co-citizens and compatriots found themselves outside Russian territory. Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2005/04/25/2031_type70029type82912_87086.shtml |title=Annual Address to the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation |publisher=Kremlin.ru |date= |accessdate=2014-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524042631/http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2005/04/25/2031_type70029type82912_87086.shtml |archivedate=2009-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2003, Putin was quoted as saying: "The Soviet Union is a very complicated page in the history of our peoples. It was heroic and constructive, and it was also tragic. But it is a page that has been turned. It's over, the boat has sailed. Now we need to think about the present and the future of our peoples".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2003/09/19/1204_type82914type82915_52505.shtml Answers to Questions at a Press Conference following the CIS Summit] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120803052552/http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2003/09/19/1204_type82914type82915_52505.shtml |date=2012-08-03 }}, September 19, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2004, Putin said: "It is my deep conviction that the dissolution of the Soviet Union was a national tragedy on a massive scale. I think the ordinary citizens of the former Soviet Union and the citizens in the post-Soviet space, the CIS countries, have gained nothing from it. On the contrary, people have been faced with a host of problems." He went on to say, "Incidentally, at that period, too, opinions varied, including among the leaders of the Union republics. For example, [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] was categorically opposed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and he said so openly proposing various formulas for preserving the state within the common borders. But, I repeat, all that is in the past. Today we should look at the situation in which we live. One cannot keep looking back and fretting about it: we should look forward".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/text/speeches/2004/02/12/0002_163321.shtml President Vladimir Putin’s Answers to Questions During a Meeting with His Election Campaign Representatives] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120802234228/http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/text/speeches/2004/02/12/0002_163321.shtml |date=2012-08-02 }}, February 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, he said in the interview to the ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine: "Russia is an ancient country with historical, profound traditions and a very powerful moral foundation. And this foundation is a love for the Motherland and patriotism. Patriotism in the best sense of that word. Incidentally, I think that to a certain extent, to a significant extent, this is also attributable to the American people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2007/12/19/1618_type82916_154779.shtml Interview with Time Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306114451/http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2007/12/19/1618_type82916_154779.shtml |date=2008-03-06 }} December 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, ''The Economist'' claimed: "Russia today is ruled by the KGB elite, has a Soviet anthem, servile media, corrupt courts and a rubber-stamping parliament. A new history textbook proclaims that the Soviet Union, although not a democracy, was 'an example for millions of people around the world of the best and fairest society'".&lt;ref name="IntellEc" /&gt;

In November, 2008, ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Kremlin in the Putin era has often sought to maintain as much sway over the portrayal of history as over the governance of the country. In seeking to restore Russia's standing, Putin and other officials have stoked a nationalism that glorifies Soviet triumphs while playing down or even whitewashing the system's horrors. As a result, throughout Russia, many archives detailing killings, persecution and other such acts committed by the Soviet authorities have become increasingly off-limits. The role of the security services seems especially delicate, perhaps because Putin is a former KGB agent who headed the agency's successor, the FSB, in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/11/26/europe/26archives.php |title=Purging history of Stalin's terror |work=International Herald Tribune |date=November 27, 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055420/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/11/26/europe/26archives.php |archivedate=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In August 2014, he rejected [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]]'s proposal to return the Imperial flag and [[God Save the Tsar!|anthem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rosja powinna być monarchią, a Putin imperatorem|url=http://www.wprost.pl/ar/464562/Rosja-powinna-byc-monarchia-a-Putin-imperatorem/|accessdate=24 August 2014|agency=wprost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== State-sponsored global public relations effort ==
Shortly after the [[Beslan school hostage crisis|Beslan terror act]] in September 2004, Putin enhanced a Kremlin-sponsored program aimed at "improving Russia's image" abroad.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/05/AR2008030503539_pf.html |title=Russia Pumps Tens of Millions Into Burnishing Image Abroad |date=2008-03-06 |work=Washington Post |accessdate=2009-01-04 |first=Peter |last=Finn}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an unnamed former Duma deputy, there existed a classified article in the RF federal budget that provided for financing measures to this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsru.com/russia/13sep2004/conference.html Кремль пытается скупать западных журналистов, которые улучшат его имидж] [[NEWSru]] September 13, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major projects of the program was the creation in 2005 of ''[[Russia Today]]''—a rolling [[English language|English-language]] TV news channel providing 24-hour news coverage, modeled on [[CNN]]. Towards its start-up budget, $30 million of public funds were allocated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/52n/n52n-s00.shtml «Честь России стоит дорого».

Russia's deputy foreign minister [[Grigory Karasin]] said in August 2008 in the context of the [[2008 South Ossetia war|Russia-Georgia conflict]]: "Western media is a well-organized machine, which is showing only those pictures that fit in well with their thoughts.

The public relations efforts notwithstanding, according to an opinion poll released in February 2009 by the BBC World Service Russia's image around the world had taken a dramatic dive in 2008: forty-two percent of respondents said they had a "mainly negative" view of Russia, according to the poll, which surveyed more than 13,000 people in 21 countries in December and January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/1010/42/374363.htm |title=Russia's Image Takes Major Hit, Poll Finds |date=February 9, 2009 |work=[[The Moscow Times]] |accessdate=2009-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217144035/http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/1010/42/374363.htm |archivedate=February 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paramount leadership or tandemocracy? ==
{{main|Tandemocracy}}
The 2008 power-switching operation between Putin and Medvedev was widely seen as a ''pro forma'' action after the constitution did not allow Putin to be reelected for a third term in the [[Russian presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]]. Both scholars and the Russian population disagree on whether the "Putin-Medvedev tandemocracy" represented the [[paramount leader]]ship of Putin, with Medvedev being just a mascot, or if the power was shared.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Criticism ==

=== Personality cult ===
[[File:PresidentPutin.JPG|thumb|Satirical cartoon about Putin's influence on the media]]

In June 2001, the [[BBC]] noted that a year after Putin took office, the Russian media had been reflecting on what some saw as a growing [[personality cult]] around him: Russia's [[TV-6 (Russia)|TV-6]] television had shown a vast choice of portraits of Putin on sale at a shopping mall in an underground passage near Moscow's Park of Culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/1390283.stm Private enterprise meets personality cult.] [[BBC]] June 15, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, some scenes at the [[United Russia]] congress caused [[Belarus]] [[President of Belarus|President]] [[Alexander Lukashenko]], who was allied to Russia within the "[[Union State]]", to recall the Soviet times, complete with the official adoration towards the Communist Party leader and talking to Russia's regional press representatives he said that in Russia Putin's personality cult was being created.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.lenta.ru/news/2007/10/12/luka/ Лукашенко обнаружил в России культ личности Путина] ("Lukashenko has discovered Putin's personality cult in Russia") October 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[Paris]]-based [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] reported that ahead of the December parliamentary and March presidential elections, in which despite being required by the constitution to leave office Putin was widely expected to find some way to retain power as his personality cult was gathering pace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaba.com/news-story/putin-personality-cult-gathers-pace-ahead-election Putin personality cult gathers pace ahead of election.] [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] October 15, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511183405/http://www.haaba.com/news-story/putin-personality-cult-gathers-pace-ahead-election |date=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Medvedev was elected President in March 2008, [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]]-funded [[Radio Liberty]] reported that during his eight-year presidency Putin had managed to build a personality cult around himself similar to those created by Soviet leaders. Although there had not been giant statues of Putin put up across the country (like those of Stalin before), he had the honor of being the only Russian leader to have had a pop song written about him: "I want a man like Putin", which hit the charts in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1079604.html Russia: Can Medvedev Create Putin-Style Personality Cult?] [[Radio Liberty]] March 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after becoming Russian Prime Minister, Putin was reported to have joked to a group of his KGB associates: "A group of FSB colleagues dispatched to work undercover in the government has successfully completed its first mission".&lt;ref name="Paddock"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/47922334.html?dids=47922334:47922334&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+12%2C+2000&amp;author=RICHARD+C.+PADDOCK&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1&amp;desc=COLUMN+ONE |title='&amp;#39;The KGB Rises Again in Russia'&amp;#39; – by R.C.

The former [[Securitate]] [[Lieutenant General]] and [[defector]] [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]] said in his interview for conservative ''[[FrontPage Magazine]]'' in 2006 that "former KGB officers are running" Russia and that FSB, which he called "the [[KGB]] successor" had the right to monitor the population electronically, control political process, search private property, cooperate with employees of the federal government, create [[Front organization|front enterprises]], investigate cases and run its own prisons.&lt;ref name="front1"&gt;[http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=23038 Symposium: When an Evil Empire Returns], interview with [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], [[R.

Various 2006 estimates showed that Russia had above 200,000 members of the FSB, or one FSB employee for every 700 citizens of Russia (the exact number of the overall FSB staff is [[classified information|classified]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ng.ru/politics/2006-01-27/2_stolica.html FSB will get new members, the capital will get new land], by Igor Plugataryov and Viktor Myasnikov, [[Nezavisimaya Gazeta]], 2006, (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Russian Armed Forces]] [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|General Staff]] as well as its subordinate structures, such as the Russian [[Strategic Missile Troops]] headquarters, are not submitted to the Federal Security Service,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.ru/eng/ Russian Armed Forces], official site (in English) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014000345/http://www.mil.ru/eng/ |date=October 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the FSB might be interested in monitoring such structures as they intrinsically involve state secrets and various degrees of admittance to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.fsb.ru/under/secret.html Law on State Secrets], 1997 edition {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024195605/http://www.fsb.ru/under/secret.html |date=October 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Law on Federal Security Service&lt;ref name="fsblaw"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.fsb.ru/under/pologen.html Law about the Organs of the Federal Security Service] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905010445/http://www.fsb.ru/under/pologen.html |date=September 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which defines its functions and establishes its structure does not involve such tasks as managing strategic branches of national industry, controlling political groups, or infiltrating the federal government.&lt;ref name="fsblaw" /&gt;

In 2006, political scientist Julie Anderson wrote: "Under Russian Federation President and former career foreign intelligence officer Vladimir Putin, an 'FSB State' composed of [[Chekism|chekists]] has been established and is consolidating its hold on the country. Its closest partners are [[organized crime|organized criminals]]. In a world marked by a [[globalization|globalized economy]] and information infrastructure, and with [[List of designated terrorist organizations|transnational terrorism groups]] utilizing all available means to achieve their goals and further their interests, [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Russian intelligence]] collaboration with these elements is potentially disastrous".&lt;ref name="Takeover" /&gt;

Russian historian [[Yuri Felshtinsky]] compared the takeover of the Russian state by the ''siloviki'' to an imaginary scenario of the [[Gestapo]] coming to power in [[Germany]] after [[World War II]]. He pointed out a fundamental difference between the [[secret police]] and ordinary [[political parties]], even [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] ones, such as the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], i.e. Russia's secret police organizations are wont to employ the so-called [[active measures]] and [[extrajudicial killing]]s, hence they killed [[Alexander Litvinenko]] and directed [[Russian apartment bombings]] and other terrorism acts in Russia to frighten the civilian population and achieve their political objectives, according to Felstinsky.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-span.org/video/?200627-1/book-discussion-blowing-russia-secret-plot Blowing Up Russia: The Secret Plot to Bring Back KGB Terror] Historian [[Yuri Felshtinsky]] explains his views on the nature of Putinism on [[C-SPAN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, [[Reuel Marc Gerecht]], a former [[Middle East]] specialist at the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), presented a list of those who had "mysteriously" died during Putin's presidency and wrote: "Vladimir Putin's Russia is a new phenomenon in Europe: a state defined and dominated by former and active-duty security and intelligence officers. Not even [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]], or the [[Soviet Union]] – all undoubtedly much worse creations than Russia – were as top-heavy with intelligence talent. [...] There is no historical precedent for a society so dominated by former and active-duty internal-security and intelligence officials – men who rose up in a professional culture in which murder could be an acceptable, even obligatory, business practice. [...] Those who operated within the Soviet sphere were the most malevolent in their practices. These men mentored and shaped Putin and his closest friends and allies. It is therefore unsurprising that Putin's Russia has become an [[assassination]]-happy state where detention, interrogation, and torture – all tried and true methods of the Soviet KGB – are used to silence the voices of untoward journalists and businessmen who annoy or threaten Putin's FSB state".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.org/publications/filter.all,pubID.25917/pub_detail.asp A Rogue Intelligence State?

One of the leading members of Putin's ruling elite, [[Nikolai Patrushev]], Director of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (August 1999–May 2008) and subsequently Secretary of the [[Security Council of Russia]], was known for his propagation of the idea of "chekists" as "neo-aristocrats" ({{lang-ru|неодворяне}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://kp.ru/daily/22458/7028/ Директор Федеральной службы безопасности России Николай Патрушев: Если мы «сломаемся» и уйдем с Кавказа – начнется развал страны] Patrushev's interview to ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'', December 20, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://txt.newsru.com/russia/06nov2007/imperia.html В России уже почти 15 тысяч "новых дворян": Ксения Собчак, Алексий II, Николай Патрушев] [[NEWSru]] November 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.agentura.ru/forum/archive/2760.html «Неодворяне» перегрызлись] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218134639/http://www.agentura.ru/forum/archive/2760.html |date=2012-02-18 }} by [[Alexander Golts]] September 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by [[Andrew Kuchins|Andrew C. Kuchins]] in November 2007 said: "The predominance of the intelligence services and mentality is a core feature of Putin’s Russia that marks a major and critical discontinuity from not only the 1990s but all of Soviet and Russian history. During the Soviet period, the Communist Party provided the glue holding the system together. During the 1990s, there was no central organizing institution or ideology. Now, with Putin, it is “former” KGB professionals who dominate the Russian ruling elite. This is a special kind of brotherhood, a mafia-like culture in which only a few can be trusted. The working culture is secretive and nontransparent".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csis.org/media/csis/pubs/071214-russia_2017-web.pdf Alternative Futures for Russia to 2017] A Report of the Russia and Eurasia Program, [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] November 2007, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cronyism and corruption ===
{{see also|Russian oligarch}}
In 2000, Russia's [[political analyst]] [[Andrei Piontkovsky]] called Putinism "the highest and culminating stage of bandit capitalism in Russia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/4094.html#1 Putinism: highest stage of robber capitalism], by [[Andrei Piontkovsky]], ''The Russia Journal'', February 7–13, 2000. The title is an allusion to work "[[Imperialism]] as the last and culminating stage of capitalism" by [[Vladimir Lenin]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711235241/http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/4094.html#1 |date=July 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that "Russia is not corrupt. [[Political corruption|Corruption]] is what happens in all countries when businessmen offer officials large bribes for favors. Today’s Russia is unique. The businessmen, the politicians, and the bureaucrats are the same people. They have [[Privatization in Russia|privatized]] the country’s wealth and taken control of its financial flows".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&amp;id=4852 Review of Andrei's Pionkovsky's ''Another Look Into Putin's Soul'' by the Honorable Rodric Braithwaite], [[Hoover Institute]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230557/http://www.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&amp;id=4852 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar [[Karen Dawisha]], 110 of Putin's cronies control 35% of Russia's wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Putin's Kleptocracy: Who Owns Russia?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwWZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=%22democracy+for+decoration+rather+than+direction%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1I-e2E5rBa&amp;sig=1RXjmUbI0_MkwmYJYhHWkFTZcqg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAWoVChMI7KXap4ibyAIVA0AaCh1K1ACf#v=onepage&amp;q=%22democracy%20for%20decoration%20rather%20than%20direction%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=October 3, 2015|date=September 30, 2014|pages=8|last1=Dawisha|first1=Karen|isbn=1476795215|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In concluding her book ''A Russian Diary'' (2007), the Russian [[investigative journalist]] [[Anna Politkovskaya]] said: "Our state authorities today are only interested in making money. That is literally all they are interested in".&lt;ref&gt;[[Anna Politkovskaya]]. ''A Russian Diary'', Vintage Books, London, 2008, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such views were shared by politologist Julie Anderson who said the same person can be a Russian intelligence officer, an organized criminal and a businessman,&lt;ref name="Takeover" /&gt; who quoted the former CIA Director [[James Woolsey]] as saying: "I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and [[Law enforcement in Russia|law enforcement]], and Russian business. I have often illustrated this point with the following hypothetical: If you should chance to strike up a conversation with an articulate, English-speaking Russian in, say, the restaurant of one of the luxury hotels along Lake Geneva, and he is wearing a $3,000 suit and a pair of Gucci loafers, and he tells you that he is an executive of a Russian trading company and wants to talk to you about a joint venture, then there are four possibilities. He may be what he says he is. He may be a Russian intelligence officer working under commercial cover. He may be part of a Russian organized crime group. But the really interesting possibility is that he may be all three and that none of those three institutions have any problem with the arrangement".&lt;ref&gt;(''Congressional Statement of R. James Woolsey, Former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, 21 September 1999, Hearing on the Bank of New York and Russian Money Laundering'')&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the political scientist Dmitri Glinsky, "[t]he idea of Russia, Inc.—or better, Russia, Ltd.—derives from the Russian brand of [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[anarchism]] viewing the state as just another private armed gang claiming special rights on the basis of its unusual power", "this is a state conceived as a stationary bandit imposing stability by eliminating the roving bandits of the previous era".&lt;ref name="Glinski"&gt;[http://www.csis.org/media/csis/pubs/pm_0147.pdf The Essence of Putinism: The Strengthening of the Privatized State] by Dmitri Glinski Vassiliev, [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], November 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, Putin himself expressed extreme irritation about the ''de facto'' privatization of the customs sphere, where smart officials and entrepreneurs "merged in ecstasy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/2006-119-19.cfm Pavel K.

According to the estimates published in "Putin and Gazprom" by Boris Nemtsov and Vladimir Milov, Putin and his friends pilfered assets of $80 billion from Gazprom during his second term as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Anders Åslund]] |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/1016/42/373401.htm |title=Crisis Puts Putinomics to the Test |work=[[The Moscow Times]] |date=December 24, 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225193048/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/1016/42/373401.htm |archivedate=December 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petersoninstitute.org/publications/opeds/oped.cfm?ResearchID=1086 Crisis Puts Putinomics to the Test] Peterson Institute for International Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 February 2009, Russian billionaire [[Alexander Lebedev]] claimed that Prime Minister Putin's strategy for economic recovery was based on cronyism and was fueling corruption and also said: "We have two Putins. There are lots of words, but the system doesn't work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/1009/42/374055.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120918121928/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/1009/42/374055.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 18, 2012 |title=Lebedev Slams Putin's Anti-Crisis Strategy |work=[[The Moscow Times]] |date=January 30, 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Panama Papers ===
{{see also|Panama Papers}}
The [[Panama Papers]] revealed a network of secret offshore deals and vast loans worth $2bn (£1.4bn) that seem to lay a trail to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. The transactions include fake share deals; multimillion-dollar charges for vague "consultancy" services; and repeated payments of large sums in "compensation" for allegedly cancelled share deals and a $200m loan for $1. Though his name does not appear in any of the records, the data shows how deals that seemingly could not have been secured without his patronage made members of his close circle fabulously wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/panama-papers-money-hidden-offshore Panama Papers: a special investigation:  Revealed: the $2bn offshore trail that leads to Vladimir Putin] Guardian 3 Apr 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology ==
Political scientist Irina Pavlova said that [[Chekism|chekists]] were not merely a corporation of people united to expropriate financial assets as they had long-standing political objectives of transforming [[Moscow]] to the [[Third Rome]] and an [[ideology]] of "containing" the United States.&lt;ref name="Pavlova"&gt;[http://www.grani.ru/Politics/Russia/President/m.128359.html Badly informed optimists], by Irina Pavlova, grani.ru&lt;/ref&gt; Columnist [[George Will]] emphasized in 2003 the [[nationalism|nationalistic nature]] of Putinism: "Putinism is becoming a toxic brew of nationalism directed against neighboring nations, and populist envy, backed by assaults of state power, directed against private wealth. Putinism is a form of [[national socialism]] without the demonic element of [[Adolf Hitler|its pioneer]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/will121503.asp Democracy under siege] [[George Will]] December 15, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Illarionov, the [[ideology]] of chekists is [[nashism]] ("ours-ism"), the selective application of rights.&lt;ref name="Illarionov" /&gt;

According to [[Dmitri Trenin]] (2004), Head of the [[Carnegie Moscow Center]], the then Russia was one of the least ideological countries around the world: "Ideas hardly matter, whereas interests reign supreme. It is not surprising then that the worldview of Russian elites is focused on financial interests. Their practical deeds in fact declare In capital we trust". Trenin described Russia's elite involved in the process of policy-making as people who largely owned the country. Most of them were not public politicians, but the majority were bureaucratic capitalists. According to Trenin, "having survived in a ruthless domestic business and political environment, Russian leaders are well adjusted to rough competition and will take that mindset to the world stage". However, Trenin called Russian-Western relations, from Moscow's perspective, "competitive, but not antagonistic". He said that "Russia does not crave world domination, and its leaders do not dream of restoring the Soviet Union. They plan to rebuild Russia as a great power with a global reach, organized as a supercorporation".&lt;ref name=Trenin&gt;[http://carnegieendowment.org/2007/03/01/russia-redefines-itself-and-its-relations-with-west/3lz "Russia Redefines Itself and Its Relations with the West"], by [[Dmitri Trenin]], ''[[The Washington Quarterly]]'', Spring 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Trenin, Russians "no longer recognize U.S. or European moral authority". He said that "from the Russian perspective, there is no absolute freedom anywhere in the world, no perfect democracy, and no government that does not lie to its people. In essence, all are equal by virtue of sharing the same imperfections. Some are more powerful than others, however, and that is what really counts".&lt;ref name=Trenin /&gt;

=== Accusations of neo-Stalinism ===

In May 2000, ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote: "When a band of former [[Soviet dissident]]s declared in February that Putinism was nothing short of modernised [[Stalinism]], they were widely dismissed as hysterical prophets of doom. 'Authoritarianism is growing harsher, society is being militarised, the military budget is increasing,' they warned, before calling on the West to 're-examine its attitude towards the Kremlin leadership, to cease indulging it in its barbaric actions, its dismantlement of democracy and suppression of human rights.' In the light of Putin's actions during his first days in power, their warnings have gained an uneasy new resonance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/29/russia.ameliagentleman|title=Back to the USSR|publisher=The Guardian|date=29 May 2000|accessdate=2009-02-24 |location=London |first=Amelia |last=Gentleman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, [[Arnold Beichman]], a conservative research fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]], wrote in ''[[The Washington Times]]'' that "Putinism in the 21st century has become as significant a watchword as Stalinism was in the 20th".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/feb/10/20070210-101939-5365r/|title=Regression in Russia|work=[[Washington Times]]|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2007, Lionel Beehner, formerly a senior writer for the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], maintained that on Putin's watch [[nostalgia]] for Stalin had grown even among young Russians and Russians' [[neo-Stalinism]] manifesting itself in several ways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/publication/13697/ Russia's Soviet Past Still Haunts Relations with West] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202063214/http://www.cfr.org/publication/13697/ |date=2008-12-02 }} by [[Lionel Beehner]] [[Council on Foreign Relations]] June 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, responding to a listener's assertion that "Putin had steered the country to Stalinism" and "all entrepreneurs" were being jailed in Russia, the Russian opposition radio host [[Yevgeniya Albats]] said: "Come on, this is not true; there is no Stalinism, no concentration camps—thankfully". She went on to say that if citizens of the country would not be critical of what was occurring around them, referring to the "orchestrated, or genuine" calls for the "[[tsar]] to stay on", that "could blaze the trail for very ugly things and a very tough regime in our country".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echo.msk.ru/programs/albac/55902/ "Full Albats"] [[Ekho Moskvy]], [[Yevgeniya Albats]], October 28, 2007. (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Putin has said that Stalin's legacy cannot be judged in black and white in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20091203/157087162.html|title=Putin says Stalin's legacy can't be judged in black and white|date=3 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Putin's policies have been likened to the Soviet era, he  has received a lukewarm response by [[Gennady Zyuganov]], the leader of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Russian Communist Party]] (KPRF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3c6abd0c-5309-11e1-8aa1-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2WMwq7eL5|title=Kremlin has plan B for poll run-off|work=Financial Times|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kprf.ru/party_live/61739.html|title=G.Zyuganov.

=== Putin’s Ideology as State First ===
While some might argue that Putin’s leadership does not reflect an ideology, Chris Miller &lt;ref name="Miller2018"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Chris |last=Miller |title= Putinomics: Power and Money in Resurgent Russia |url= https://www.amazon.com/Putinomics-Power-Money-Resurgent-Russia/dp/146964066X |accessdate=June 29, 2018 |year=2018 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |isbn= 146964066X |page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; has discerned three beliefs which are consistent with Putin’s announcements and account for his actions.  This 3-part ideology must be understood in the context of the history of Russia and of Putin himself.  When Putin began his political career the Soviet Union was unable to effectively collect taxes or provide services, in part, due to inadequate governmental control of the empire.  Putin believed that the government needed to first establish strong centralized control of the empire.  To maintain that central control has always been his highest priority.  Second, to keep the populace supportive of his government and thus to prevent revolt, Putin believes that the key is rising wages and pensions.  In that way he maintains enough of a popular base that the populace tends to tolerate other problems. Third, economic progress depends heavily on private enterprises but only so long as those enterprises do not interfere with either central government control or rising salaries and pensions.  When a private enterprise threatens either belief one or two, then the government takes control of the enterprise so that the enterprise supports beliefs one and two. Of course, these three beliefs are not followed without some compromises, but Miller well argues that these beliefs help explain the behavior of Putin.

'''Sallar Deylami''' (Persian:سلار دیلمی) is one of the first Iranian Shia jurists during the fifth century of the [[Islamic calendar]] (11th century CE). He is considered a jurist of the class of [[Shaykh Tusi]].&lt;ref name="eshia1"&gt;[http://lib.eshia.ir/10257/25/10/%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B1_%D8%AF%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth==
Abu Ali Hamzeh Ibn Abdul Aziz, known as Sallar Deylami (died in 448 or 463 Lunar Hijrah)&lt;ref name="eshia1"/&gt; was a [[Shia]] [[Jurist]] and religious scholar during the fifth lunar hijrah. He was born in the last half of fourth lunar hijrah, in [[Deylaman]]. He was the candidate of [[Shaykh Mufid]] and [[Sharif al-Murtaza]] in the affairs of teaching and education. He was versed in different disciplines and subjects but his dominance in fiqh is more prevalent. He is considered to be an eminent pupil of Shaykh Mufid and Sayyed Murtaza. He is also considered to be an important religious scholar after the occultation of Imam [[Mahdi]] the twelfth Shia Imam. His title, Abu Ya'li, designates dignity and superiority. The name ''Sallar'' may be an Arabized form of the Persian ''Salar''.

==Characters==
Allameh Hilli considered Sallar among the eminent Shia jurists and writers. Abul Qasem khoei knows Sallar as trustworthy and reliable in tradition and jurisprudence. Some scholars like Soyuti count Sallar among the men of knowledge of Nahv (the grammar of the Arabic language). He also counted among ten ''Al-Marāsim al-‘Alawīyah fī al-aḥkām al-Nabawīyah''. This book is considered among the early books on Shia jurisprudence. The part on peace is an independent section in Al-Marasem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.eshia.ir/10242/34/92/%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B1_%D8%AF%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two eminent works by him written about shia jurisprudence. One of them is Tatmīm al-mulakhkhaṣ considered as a glossary on the book of Sharif Murtaza's "al-Mulakhkhaṣ". The book of Tatmim is lost. The other eminent book is called "Kitāb al-marāsim" many times published.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Shaykh al-Ṭūsī: His Writings on Theology and their Reception* Hassan Ansari and Sabine Schmidtke,p.477&lt;/ref&gt;

==Juridicial judgments==

He believed in the prohibition of creating sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.eshia.ir/10257/4/3/%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B1_%D8%AF%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C ]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he divided criminals according to their intention of causing harm or not, into intentional, deliberate action and quasi-delibrate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.eshia.ir/23019/1/4923/%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B1_%D8%AF%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C ]&lt;/ref&gt; Also he believes in legality of praying on Friday provided that the presence of infallible Imam or someone on behalf of him is included.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.eshia.ir/23019/1/4864/%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B1_%D8%AF%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C ]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2016}}

{{Japanese name| Mushanokōji}}
{{nihongo|'''Saneatsu Mushanokōji'''|武者小路 実篤(實篤)|Mushanokōji Saneatsu|extra=12 May 1885 – 9 April 1976}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] novelist, playwright, poet, artist, and philosopher active during the late [[Taishō period|Taishō]] and [[Shōwa period]]s of Japan. Though he later changed his surname to ''Mushakōji'', he was generally known by his former name ''Mushanokōji''. He was nicknamed ''Musha'' and ''Futo-o'' by his colleagues.

==Early life==
Born in [[Kōjimachi]], [[Chiyoda, Tokyo]] Saneatsu was the eighth son of [[Viscount]] Mushanokōji Saneyo, who died when Saneatsu was age two. Raised mostly by his mother. Saneatsu was a frail and sickly youth, unable to compete in the physical activities at the [[Gakushūin]] Peers' School.  To compensate, he developed his [[debate|debating skills]] and developed an interest in literature. During his time at this school he became friends with [[Naoya Shiga]], and was introduced by his uncle to the [[Bible]] and the works of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]. Saneatsu enrolled in the [[sociology]] department of [[Tokyo Imperial University]], but left without graduating in 1907 to form a literary group with [[Kinoshita Rigen]], Shiga Naoya, [[Arishima Takeo]], and [[Ogimachi Kinkazu]] ([[:ja:正親町公和]]). They named the group ''Jūyokkakai'' (''The Fourteenth Day Club''). This group evolved into the ''[[Shirakaba]]'' (''White Birch'') literary coterie, and began publishing a [[literary magazine]] of the same name in 1910. In 1913, Saneatsu married Fusako Miyagi, a woman to whom he had earlier been introduced by Kokichi Otake. Both Miyagi and Otake were members of the women's literary association (and publishers of the journal of the same name), "[[Bluestocking (magazine)|Bluestocking]]".

==Literary career==
As a key member of ''Shirakaba'', Mushanokōji in 1910 published his work {{nihongo|''Omedetaki Hito''|お目出たき人|''Good Natured Person''}} in its magazine. This was followed by {{nihongo|''Seken shirazu''|世間知らず|''Babe in the Woods''}}, in 1912. Through the medium of ''Shirakaba'', Mushanokōji began moving away from the Tolstoy ideal of self-sacrifice, and promoted his philosophy of [[humanism]] as an alternative to then-popular form of [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]]. While his humanism borrowed some elements from naturalism, he in general believed that humanity controlled its own destiny through the assertion of will, whereas the naturalists tended to see the individual as powerless and desperate against forces beyond personal control.

With the outbreak of [[World War I]], Mushanokōji turned again to Tolstoy for inspiration and for the further development of his [[humanitarianism]] philosophy. During this time, he published {{nihongo|''Sono imōto''|その妹|''His Sister''}} (1915), a play involving a choice between self-love and love for mankind. He relocated to what is now part of [[Abiko, Chiba]] in 1916, together with Shiga Naoya and [[Yanagi Sōetsu]].

In 1918, Mushanokōji took the next step in the development of his philosophy by moving to the mountains of [[Kijō, Miyazaki]] in [[Kyūshū]], and establishing a quasi-[[Utopian socialism|socialistic]] [[utopia]]n [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]], [[Atarashiki-mura]] (New Village) along vaguely [[Tolstoyan]] lines. Soon afterwards, he published {{nihongo|''Kōfukumono''|幸福者|''A Happy Man''}} (1919), a novel presenting his image of the ideal human; and {{nihongo|''Yūjō''| 友情|''Friendship''}} (1920), a novel portraying the victory of humanism over ego. His idealism appears in his [[autobiographical novel]] {{nihongo|''Aru otoko''|或る男|''A Certain Man''}} (1923), and in the play {{nihongo|''Ningen banzai'' |人間万歳|''Three Cheers for Mankind''}} (1922). 
The commune also published its own literary magazine, ''Atarashiki-mura''. In the 1920s, while running the commune, Mushanokōji was very prolific in his literary output. However, Mushanokōji tired of the social experiment and left the village in 1926; a dam project forced it to relocate to [[Saitama Prefecture]] in 1939, where it still exists.

After the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]] of 1923, Mushanokōji returned to Tokyo to run an art gallery, and started to sell his own paintings, mostly [[still lifes]] depicting pumpkins and other vegetables. Publication of ''Shirakaba'' was suspended after the earthquake, but Mushanokōji went on to bring out the literary magazine, ''Fuji'', with the novelist and playwright [[Nagayo Yoshirō]]. During this period, he turned his attention to writing [[historical novels]] or [[biographical novel]]s, such as ''[[Ninomiya Sontoku]],'' about the 19th century farm technologist and agricultural philosopher.

Through the 1930s and 1940s, he faded from the literary world. Encouraged by his older brother [[Kintomo Mushanokōji]], who was the Japanese ambassador to [[Nazi Germany]], he traveled throughout Europe in 1936. In 1946, he was appointed to a seat in the [[Japanese House of Peers|House of Peers]] of the [[Diet of Japan]]. However, four months later he was [[Purge (During Occupation of Japan)|purged]] from public office by the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|American Occupation authorities]], due to his {{nihongo|''Dai Tōa Senso Shikan'' |大東亜戦争私観|''Personal Thoughts on the Great East Asia War ''}} (1942), supporting the actions of the Japanese government in [[World War II]].

Mushanokōji made a literary comeback with his novel {{nihongo|''Shinri sensei''|真理先生|''Teacher of Truth''}} (1949–1950). He was awarded the [[Order of Culture]] in 1951, and became a member of the [[Japan Art Academy]] in 1952.

Mushanokōji lived to the age of 90. He died at the [[Jikei University School of Medicine]] Hospital in [[Komae, Tokyo]] of [[uremia]]. His grave is at the Chūō Reien in the city of [[Hachiōji, Tokyo|Hachiōji]], close to Tokyo. His home in [[Chōfu, Tokyo]], where he lived from 1955 to 1976 has been turned into a memorial museum.

'''Simon Blackburn''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (born 12 July 1944) is an English academic philosopher known for his work in metaethics, where he defends [[quasi-realism]], and in the philosophy of language; more recently, he has gained a large general audience from his efforts to popularise philosophy.

He retired as the professor of philosophy at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 2011, but remains a distinguished research professor of philosophy at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], teaching every fall semester. He is also a [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellow]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and a member of the professoriate of [[New College of the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nchum.org/faculty/professor-simon-blackburn |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150125184840/https://www.nchum.org/faculty/professor-simon-blackburn |archivedate=25 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was previously a Fellow of [[Pembroke College, Oxford]] and has also taught full-time at the University of North Carolina as an Edna J. Koury Professor. He is a former president of the [[Aristotelian Society]], having served the 2009–2010 term.  He was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/sections/index.cfm?member=4362 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304062531/http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/sections/index.cfm?member=4362 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Foreign Honorary Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/news/cambridge-academics-elected-to-american-academy-of-arts-sciences|title=Cambridge academics elected to American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences|author=|date=30 April 2008|website=cam.ac.uk|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has appeared in multiple episodes of the documentary series ''[[Closer to Truth]]''.

==Early life and education==
Blackburn was born on 12 July 1944 in [[Chipping Sodbury]], England. He attended [[Clifton College]] and went on to receive his bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1965 from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He obtained his doctorate in 1970 from [[Churchill College, Cambridge]].

==Life and views==
In philosophy, he is best known as the proponent of [[quasi-realism]] in [[meta-ethics]] and as a defender of neo-[[David Hume|Hume]]an views on a variety of topics. He is a former editor of the journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''. He makes occasional appearances in the British media, such as on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[The Moral Maze]]''.  Blackburn was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a patron of [[Humanists UK]] (formerly the British Humanist Association), and when asked to define his atheism, he said he prefers the label ''infidel'' over ''atheist'':
{{quote|Being an infidel, that is, just having no faith, I do not have to prove anything. I have no faith in the Loch Ness Monster, but do not go about trying to prove that it does not exist, although there are certainly overwhelming arguments that it does not.&lt;ref name="here"&gt;Philosophy Now's interview with Simon Blackburn, November 2013, accessible [http://philosophynow.org/issues/99/Simon_Blackburn here]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2008 ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'', which was authored by Blackburn, was published. He was one of 55 public figures to sign an open letter published in ''The Guardian'' in September 2010, stating their opposition to [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s state visit to the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/15/harsh-judgments-on-pope-religion|title=Letters: Harsh judgments on the pope and religion|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 September 2010 | location=London | date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has argued that "religionists" should have less influence in political affairs.&lt;ref name="here"/&gt; At the same time, he has also argued, in a televised debate, against the position of the [[antitheism|antitheist]] author and neuroscientist [[Sam Harris]] that morality can be derived from science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtH3Q54T-M8|title=The Great Debate - Can Science Tell Us Right From Wrong?

{{Taoism condensed}}

'''''Taiji''''' ({{zh|s=太极|t=太極|hp=''tàijí''|l=great pole}}) is a [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese]] [[Cosmology|cosmological]] term for the "Supreme Ultimate" state of undifferentiated absolute and infinite potential, the oneness before duality, from which [[Yin and Yang]] originate, can be compared with the old ''[[Wuji (philosophy)|Wuji]]'' (無極, "without ridgepole").

The term ''Taiji'' and its other spelling ''T'ai chi'' (using [[Wade Giles|Wade–Giles]] as opposed to [[Pinyin]]) are most commonly used in the West to refer to ''Taijiquan'' (or ''[[T'ai chi ch'uan]]'',  太極拳), an internal martial art, Chinese meditation system and health practice. This article, however, refers only to the use of the term in [[Chinese philosophy]] and [[Taoism|Taoist]] spirituality.

== Etymology ==
The word 太極 comes from ''[[I Ching]]'': "易有太極，是生兩儀，兩儀生四象，四象生八卦，八卦定吉凶，吉凶生大業。"

''Taiji'' ([[Wikt:太極|太極]]) is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''tai'' [[Wikt:太|太]] "great; grand; supreme; extreme; very; too" (a superlative variant of ''da'' [[Wikt:大|大]] "big; large; great; very") and ''ji'' [[Wikt:極|極]] "pole; roof ridge; highest/utmost point; extreme; earth's pole; reach the end; attain; exhaust". In analogy with the figurative meanings of English ''pole'', Chinese ''ji'' 極 "ridgepole" can mean "[[geographical pole]]; direction" (e.g., ''siji'' 四極 "four corners of the earth{{what?|date=July 2018}}; world's end"), "[[North Magnetic Pole|magnetic pole]]" (''Beiji'' 北極 "North Pole" or ''yinji'' 陰極 "negative pole; cathode"), or "[[celestial pole]]" (''baji'' 八極 "farthest points of the universe; remotest place"). Combining the two words, {{linktext|太極}} means "the source, the beginning of the world".

Common English translations of the cosmological ''Taiji'' are the "Supreme Ultimate" (Le Blanc 1985, Zhang and Ryden 2002) or "Great Ultimate" (Chen 1989, Robinet 2008); but other versions are the "Supreme Pole" (Needham and Ronan 1978), "Great Absolute", or "Supreme Polarity" (Adler 1999).

== In Chinese texts==

''Taiji'' references are found in [[Chinese classic texts]] associated with many schools of [[Chinese philosophy]].

Zhang and Ryden explain the [[ontological]] necessity of ''Taiji''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any philosophy that asserts two elements such as the ''[[Yinyang|yin-yang]]'' of Chinese philosophy will also look for a term to reconcile the two, to ensure that both belong to the same sphere of discourse. The term 'supreme ultimate' performs this role in the philosophy of the ''Book of Changes''. In the Song dynasty it became a metaphysical term on a par with the Way. (2002:179) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== ''Zhuangzi'' ===

The Daoist classic ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' introduced the ''Taiji'' concept. One of the (ca. 3rd century BCE) "Inner Chapters" contrasts ''Taiji'' 太極 "great ultimate" (tr. "[[zenith]]") and ''Liuji'' 六極 "six ultimates; six [[cardinal directions]]" (tr. "[[nadir]]").
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Way has attributes and evidence, but it has no action and no form. It may be transmitted but cannot be received. It may be apprehended but cannot be seen. From the root, from the stock, before there was heaven or earth, for all eternity truly has it existed. It inspirits demons and gods, gives birth to heaven and earth. It lies above the zenith but is not high; it lies beneath the nadir but is not deep. It is prior to heaven and earth, but is not ancient; it is senior to high antiquity, but it is not old. (tr. Mair 1994:55) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== ''Huainanzi'' ===
The (2nd century BCE) ''[[Huainanzi]]'' mentions a Daoist ''[[Zhenren]]'' "true person; perfected person" and the ''Taiji'' "Supreme Ultimate" that transcends categories like [[yin and yang]], exemplified with the ''yinyang'' ''[[Chinese sun and moon mirrors#Yangsui|fusui]]'' and ''[[Chinese sun and moon mirrors#Fangzhu|fangzhu]]'' mirrors.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''fu-sui'' 夫煫 (burning mirror) gathers fire energy from the sun; the ''fang-chu'' 方諸 (moon mirror) gathers dew from the moon. What are [contained] between Heaven and Earth, even an expert calculator cannot compute their number. Thus, though the hand can handle and examine extremely small things, it cannot lay hold of the brightness [of the sun and moon]. Were it within the grasp of one's hand (within one's power) to gather [things within] one category from the Supreme Ultimate (''t'ai-chi'' 太極) above, one could immediately produce both fire and water. This is because ''Yin'' and ''Yang'' share a common ''ch'i'' and move each other. (tr. Le Blanc 1985:120-1) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== ''I Ching'' ===
''Taiji'' also appears in the Xìcí 繫辭 "Appended Judgments" commentary to the ''[[I Ching]],'' a late section traditionally attributed to [[Confucius]] but more likely dating to about the 3rd century B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Richard J.|title=Fathoming the Cosmos and Ordering the World: The Yijing (I-Ching, or Classic of Changes) and Its Evolution in China|year=2008|publisher=University of Virginia Press|location=Charlottesville|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore there is in the Changes the Great Primal Beginning. This generates the two primary forces. The two primary forces generate the four images. The four images generate the eight trigrams. The eight trigrams determine good fortune and misfortune. Good fortune and misfortune create the great field of action. (tr. Wilhelm and Baynes 1967:318-9) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This sequence of [[Power of two|powers of two]] includes [[Taiji]] → [[Yin and Yang]] (two polarities) → ''Sixiang'' ([[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four Symbols]]) → [[Bagua]] (eight trigrams).

[[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]] and Cary F. Baynes explain.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fundamental postulate is the "great primal beginning" of all that exists, ''t'ai chi'' – in its original meaning, the "ridgepole". Later Indian philosophers devoted much thought to this idea of a primal beginning. A still earlier beginning, ''wu chi'', was represented by the symbol of a circle. Under this conception, ''t'ai chi'' was represented by the circle divided into the light and the dark, yang and yin, [[Image:Yin yang.svg|15px]]. This symbol has also played a significant part in India and Europe. However, speculations of a Gnostic-dualistic character are foreign to the original thought of the ''I Ching''; what it posits is simply the ridgepole, the line. With this line, which in itself represents oneness, duality comes into the world, for the line at the same time posits an above and a below, a right and left, front and back – in a word, the world of the opposites. (1967:lv) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== ''Taijitu shuo'' ===
[[File:ZhoushiTaijitu.png|thumb|Zhou's ''Taijitu'' diagram]]

The [[Song Dynasty]] philosopher [[Zhou Dunyi]] (1017-1073 CE) wrote the ''Taijitu shuo'' 太極圖說 "Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate", which became the cornerstone of [[Neo-Confucianist]] cosmology. His brief text synthesized aspects of [[Chinese Buddhism]] and Daoism with metaphysical discussions in the ''I ching''.

Zhou's key terms [[Wuji (philosophy)|Wuji]] and Taiji appear in the opening line 無極而太極, which Adler notes could also be translated "The Supreme Polarity that is Non-Polar!".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Non-polar (''wuji'') and yet Supreme Polarity (''taiji'')! The Supreme Polarity in activity generates ''yang''; yet at the limit of activity it is still. In stillness it generates ''yin''; yet at the limit of stillness it is also active. Activity and stillness alternate; each is the basis of the other. In distinguishing ''yin'' and ''yang'', the Two Modes are thereby established. The alternation and combination of ''yang'' and ''yin'' generate water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. With these five [phases of] ''qi'' harmoniously arranged, the Four Seasons proceed through them. The Five Phases are simply ''yin'' and ''yang''; ''yin'' and ''yang'' are simply the Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-polar. [Yet] in the generation of the Five Phases, each one has its nature. (tr. Adler 1999:673-4) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Instead of usual ''Taiji'' translations "Supreme Ultimate" or "Supreme Pole", Adler uses "Supreme Polarity" (see Robinet 1990) because [[Zhu Xi]] describes it as the alternating principle of ''yin'' and ''yang'', and …
&lt;blockquote&gt;insists that ''taiji'' is not a thing (hence "Supreme Pole" will not do). Thus, for both Zhou and Zhu, ''taiji'' is the ''yin-yang'' principle of bipolarity, which is the most fundamental ordering principle, the cosmic "first principle." ''Wuji'' as "non-polar" follows from this. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Core concept ==

Taiji is understood to be the highest conceivable principle, that from which existence flows. This is very similar to the Daoist idea "reversal is the movement of the Dao". The "supreme ultimate" creates yang and yin: movement generates yang; when its activity reaches its limit, it becomes tranquil. Through tranquility the supreme ultimate generates yin. When tranquility has reached its limit, there is a return to movement. Movement and tranquility, in alternation, become each the source of the other. The distinction between the yin and yang is determined and the two forms (that is, the yin and yang) stand revealed. By the transformations of the yang and the union of the yin, the 5 elements (Qi) of water, fire, wood, metal and earth are produced. These 5 Qi become diffused, which creates harmony. Once there is harmony the 4 seasons can occur.  Yin and yang produced all things, and these in their turn produce and reproduce, this makes these processes never ending. (Wu, 1986)
Taiji underlies the practical Taijiquan ([[Taijiquan|T'ai Chi Ch'uan]]) – A Chinese internal martial art based on the principles of Yin and Yang and Taoist philosophy, and devoted to internal energetic and physical training. Taijiquan is represented by five family styles: Chen, Yang, Wu(Hao), Wu and Sun. There are also several offshoots of the five families as well as more recent simplified and combined styles for competition.

'''''The Excursion: Being a portion of The Recluse, a poem''''' is a [[long poem]] by Romantic poet [[William Wordsworth]] and was first published in 1814&lt;ref&gt;Editors' Preface. ''The Excursion.'' By William Wordsworth. Ed. Sally Bushell, James A. Bulter, et al. Ithaca: Cornell UP, 2007. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[1814 in poetry]]). It was intended to be the second part of ''The Recluse'', an unfinished larger work that was also meant to include ''[[The Prelude]]'', Wordsworth's other long poem, which was eventually published posthumously. The exact dates of its composition are unknown, but the first manuscript is generally dated as either September 1806 or December 1809.&lt;ref&gt;"Eight Stages of ''Excursion'' Composition." ''The Excursion.'' By William Wordsworth. Ed. Sally Bushell, James A. Bulter, et al. Ithaca: Cornell UP, 2007. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major characters==

''The Poet'' - the narrator of the poem

''The Wanderer'' - first introduced in Book 1, "The Wanderer." Contrary to what his title might suggest, he dwells in a fixed abode but "still he loved to pace the public roads/ And the wild paths; and, when the summer's warmth/ Invited him, would often leave his home/ And journey far, revisiting those scenes" (1.416-420)&lt;ref&gt;Wordsworth, William. ''The Excursion.'' Ed. Sally Bushell, James A. Butler, et al. Ithaca: Cornell UP, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Solitary'' - plagued by the death of his wife and children, as well as by his disenchantment with the French Revolution, the Solitary has chosen to live alone, wanting no more connection with the social world that has brought him so much pain.

''The Pastor'' - A country pastor who is encountered by the Poet, the Wanderer, and the Solitary during their excursion.

==Arrangement of the poem==
[[File:Blea_Tarn_House,_Langdale_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1015917.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blea Tarn (Langdale)|Blea Tarn]] House, believed to be the house described in ''The Solitary'']]
The poem is arranged into nine books: "The Wanderer"; "The Solitary"; "Despondency"; "Despondency Corrected"; "The Pastor"; "The Churchyard Among the Mountains"; "The Churchyard Among the Mountains, continued"; "The Parsonage"; "Discourse of the Wanderer, &amp;c.". The first and second books introduce the characters of the Wanderer and the Solitary, respectively. The third and fourth books consist of a conversation/debate between the Wanderer and the Solitary regarding the truth of Religion and the virtue of Mankind. The fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth books introduce the character of the Pastor and consist largely of the Pastor explaining the life stories of many of the townspeople who lie buried in the country-churchyard. In the final two books, all of the aforementioned characters travel to the Parsonage, are introduced to the family of the Pastor, and eventually part ways.

'''''The merger of knowledge with power: essays in critical science''''' is a book written in 1990 by [[Jerome Ravetz]]. 

The book contains a series of essays which touch upon science and policy, the role of ideologies in scientific progress, and broader themes of history and philosophy of Science, with critical attention to points of friction between science and society. "We can best understand this anthology as a 20-year continuation of his seminal
study, Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems".&lt;ref name="Review1"&gt;Dietrich Schroeer, 1992, Review of ‘The merger of knowledge with power: essays in critical science by Jerome R. Ravetz’, American Scientist, Vol. 80, No. 5 (September-October 1992), pp. 503-505.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In this book Ravetz invites us to consider science and its prodigious achievements on the face of the growing awareness that science is also at the root of many modern problems. In the opening essay "A critical awareness of science" he suggests adopting the perspective of the poor, and considering where science has failed them.     

In the  essay on "Francis Bacon and the Reform of Philosophy" Ravetz argues that Bacon's audacious reform programme owed much more to his religion views, hopes and expectation than is normally accounted for. The Chapter "Ideological Commitment in the Philosophy of Acience' offers Ravetz's first hand reading of the relevance of ideology in the philosophies of science of Karl Popper, 
Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend. 

The book has detailed discussions of risks and regulation and science's role therein, and a critique of 'reckless' science ("Hardware and Fantasy in Military Technology"). Ravetz also presents his insight on the use of ignorance ("Usable Knowledge, Usable Ignorance: Incomplete Science with Policy Implications"), the Gaia hypothesis, how to constructively tackle the problems of quality control of quantitative information, and the need for "A new social contract for science". For Carrozza (2015) &lt;ref name="Carrozza"&gt; Carrozza, C. (2015). Democratizing Expertise and Environmental Governance: Different Approaches to the Politics of Science and their Relevance for Policy Analysis. Journal of Environmental Policy &amp; Planning, 17(1), 108-126.&lt;/ref&gt; this book (p. 284) investigates the two interrelated processes
of the scientization of politics and of the politicization of expertise "in the spirit of a general call for renewing
the social contract between science and society".

[[File:Anther01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Strawberry]] anther with parallel thecae]]
A '''theca''' (plural '''thecae''') refers to a [[Leaf sheath|sheath]] or a covering.

== Botany ==
In [[botany]],the theca is related to plant's flower anatomy.The theca of an [[angiosperm]] consists of a pair of [[microsporangia]] that are adjacent to each other and share a common area of [[dehiscence (botany)|dehiscence]] called the [[stomium]].&lt;ref name=hufford&gt;[[Larry Hufford]], "The origin and early evolution of angiosperm stamens" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=SuUVYOFCTwYC&amp;pg=PA60 ''The Anther: form, function, and phylogeny''], William G. D'Arcy and Richard C. Keating (editors), [[Cambridge University Press]], 1996, 351pp, p.60, {{ISBN|978-0-521-48063-5}} (from [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt; Any part of a [[microsporophyll]] that bears microsporangia is called an [[anther]]. Most anthers are formed on the apex of a [[stamen|filament]]. An anther and its filament together form a typical (or filantherous) [[stamen]], part of the male [[flower|floral]] organ.

The typical anther is bilocular, i.e. it consists of two thecae. Each theca contains two microsporangia, also known as pollen sacs. The microsporangia produce the [[microspore]]s, which for [[seed plants]] are known as [[pollen]] grains. 

If the pollen sacs are not adjacent, or if they open separately, then no thecae are formed. In Lauraceae, for example, the pollen sacs are spaced apart and open independently. 

The tissue between the [[locule]]s and the cells is called the ''connective'' and the [[parenchyma]]. Both pollen sacs are separated by the [[stomium]]. When the anther is dehiscing, it opens at the stomium. 

The outer cells of the theca form the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]. Below the epidermis, the [[somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells form the [[tapetum (botany)|tapetum]]. These support the development of microspores into mature pollen grains. However, little is known about the underlying genetic mechanisms, which play a role in male sporo- and gametogenesis.
[[File:Graderia subintegra, helmdrade, veldblomstappie, Faerie Glen NR, a.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Divergent thecae in ''[[Graderia]]'']]
The thecal arrangement of a typical stamen can be as follows: 

* Divergent: both thecae in line, and forming an acute angle with the filament
* Transverse (or explanate): both thecae exactly in line, at right angles with the filament
* Oblique: the thecae fixed to each other in an oblique way
* Parallel: the thecae fixed to each other in a parallel way

== Zoology ==
In [[biology]], the [[theca of follicle]] can also refer to the site of [[androgen]] production in females. The theca of the spinal cord is called the [[thecal sac]], and intrathecal injections are made there or in the subarachnoid space of the [[skull]].

In [[human embryogenesis]], the theca cells form a [[corpus luteum]] after a [[Ovarian follicle|Graafian follicle]] has expelled its secondary [[oocyte]] arrested in second [[meiosis]].

Thecal shape is also important in [[graptolite]] taxonomy.

== In other taxonomic groups ==
In [[microbiology]] and [[planktology]], a theca is a subcellular structural component out of which the [[frustule]]s of [[diatom]]s and [[dinoflagellate]]s are constructed.

'''Thomas Eisner''' (June 25, 1929 – March 25, 2011) was a German-American [[entomologist]] and ecologist, known as the "father of chemical ecology."&lt;ref name="cornellsun.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Prof. Thomas Eisner, 'Father of Chemical Ecology,' Dies |url=http://cornellsun.com/section/news/content/2011/03/29/prof-thomas-eisner-%E2%80%98father-chemical-ecology%E2%80%99-dies |work=Cornell Daily Sun |date=March 29, 2011 |accessdate=March 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69TFJE60T?url=http://cornellsun.com/section/news/content/2011/03/29/prof-thomas-eisner-%E2%80%98father-chemical-ecology%E2%80%99-dies |archivedate=July 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Jacob Gould Schurman Professor of Chemical Ecology at [[Cornell University]], and Director of the Cornell Institute for Research in Chemical Ecology (CIRCE). He was a world authority on [[ethology|animal behavior]], ecology, and [[evolution]], and, together with his Cornell colleague [[Jerrold Meinwald]], was one of the pioneers of [[chemical ecology]], the discipline dealing with the chemical interactions of organisms. He was author or co-author of some 400 scientific articles and seven books.

==Personal life==
Thomas Eisner was born on June 25, 1929, in Berlin, Germany. His father, Hans Eisner, was a chemist of Jewish origin, and a coworker of [[Fritz Haber]] at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Electrochemistry in Berlin; he later held a chair for chemistry at Cornell. His mother, Margarete Heil-Eisner, was an artist. Escaping the [[Nazi]] regime, the family moved to [[Barcelona]] and, following the [[Spanish Civil War]], to [[Uruguay]].  The Eisners came to the U.S. in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/science/earth/31eisner.html |title=Thomas Eisner, Who Cracked Chemistry of Bugs, Dies at 81 |author=Kenneth Chang |work=The New York Times |date=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Eisner became a naturalized American citizen, and applied to [[Cornell University]] as an undergraduate, but was rejected. He received his B.S. and PhD degrees from [[Harvard University]], and joined Cornell's [[entomology]] faculty in 1957. He married Maria Eisner, who was a member of his lab. In 1964, he helped found the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, where he worked until his death.

In addition to his academic work, he was a passionate nature photographer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Eye-Catching Images of Nature, Made With a Common Machine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/10/science/10eisn.html |work=The New York Times |first=James |last=Gorman |date=October 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[videographer]]. His film ''Secret Weapons'' won the Grand Award at the [[New York Film Festival]] and was named Best Science Film by the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. He was also an avid pianist and occasional conductor. Eisner died on March 25, 2011, of [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name="cornellsun.com" /&gt;

He was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Angier (April 4, 2011). "Paths of Discovery, Lighted by a Bug Man's Insights". The New York Times. Retrieved 19 April 2012. Dr. Eisner died from complications of his disease on March 25, at the age of 81. He had a notoriously mordant sense of humor: "I may not believe in God," he once said, "but I don't ring doorbells saying I'm a Seventh-Day Atheist,"...&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
[[File:Chlaenius Plate 10 Eisner et al 1963.png|thumb|Series from a study by Eisner and colleagues investigating defensive spray in ''[[Chlaenius]]'' beetles with paper that turns dark in response to chemicals.]]
Eisner's main body of work was in [[chemical ecology]], primarily studying the [[chemical defense]]s of insects against [[predation]]. Some of his most famous work was conducted on the [[bombardier beetle]], which he discovered creates a chemical reaction within its body to shoot a boiling noxious liquid from a nozzle in its abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52047487|title=For love of insects|last=Thomas|first=Eisner|date=2003|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=0674011813|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=52047487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A field biologist with working experience on four continents, he was also an active conservationist. He served on the Board of Directors of the [[National Audubon Society]], the National Scientific Council of the Nature Conservancy, and the World Resources Institute Council. He was a past president of the [[American Society of Naturalists]], and chairman of the Biology Section of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]. He played a key role in initiating the Congressional Fellow Program in Washington DC, and in efforts to preserve wilderness areas in Florida and Texas.

Eisner was furthermore a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and the [[American Philosophical Society]]. He received numerous honors, including the [[Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement]], the [[Harvard Centennial Medal]], the 1994 [[National Medal of Science]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=117|title=The President's National Medal of Science: Recipient Details|last=|first=|date=|website=National Science Foundation|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lewis Thomas Prize]] for Writing about Science. He also held honorary degrees from universities in [[Sweden]], Germany, [[Switzerland]] and the United States, and was a foreign fellow of the [[The Royal Society|Royal Society]]. Eisner was additionally a member of the [[Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina]] and [[Academia Europaea]].

In 2008, Eisner was awarded the [[John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of Science|John J.

{{nihongo|'''Yatsuhiro Nakagawa'''|中川八洋|extra=born January 20, 1945}} is a Japanese conservative [[political philosophy|political philosopher]]. He is a distinguished professor at [[University of Tsukuba]].

He once served as a science and technology deputy under Prime Minister [[Noboru Takeshita]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cbs1r8gHR4IC&amp;lpg=PA195&amp;dq=Yatsuhiro%20Nakagawa&amp;pg=PA195#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Japan: The Blighted Blossom] (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
He has written several books in the field of [[international relations]], such as an evaluation of [[geopolitics]], [[Halford Mackinder]], and [[Nicholas J. Spykman]]. He perceives Japan to have developed a successful welfare system.

He is a subscriber to the philosophy of [[Edmund Burke]], who he regards as the antithesis of [[Rousseau]]. He considers Rousseau to be the father of modern European philosophy (Kant, Hegel, Marx, Darwin, etc.). He is the author of many critiques and evaluations of [[Marxist-Leninism]], the [[Frankfurt School]], [[postmodernism]], [[postcolonialism]], and [[democracy]] in general. He notably wrote an early criticism of the concept of [[gender studies]] before it had become popular in the Japanese academy.

He regards [[Akiko Yosano]] as "the greatest philosopher in Japanese history" and puts her in contrast with modern [[feminism]].

In 2000, Nakagawa wrote a rather surprising book that accused [[Fumimaro Konoe]] of responsibility for the [[Pacific War]]. It has been through several reprintings. Unlike some other modern conservatives, Nakagawa believes the Pacific War was pointless and cruel.

'''Zygmunt Bauman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aʊ|m|ən}}; 19 November 1925 – 9 January 2017) was a Polish [[sociology|sociologist]] and philosopher. He was driven out of [[Poland]] by a political purge in 1968 engineered by the Communist government of the [[Polish People's Republic]] and forced to give up his Polish citizenship to move to Israel. Three years later he moved to the United Kingdom. He resided in England from 1971 and became Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Leeds]], later Emeritus. Bauman was one of the world's most eminent social theorists, writing on issues as diverse as [[modernity]] and the [[Holocaust]], [[postmodernity|postmodern]] [[consumerism]] and [[liquid modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;Zygmunt, B. (2000). Liquid modernity. Polity, Cambridge. {{ISBN|9780745624099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{refimprove|date=March 2017}}
Bauman was born to non-observant [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jewish]] parents in [[Poznań]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], in 1925. When Poland was [[German invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland|by the Soviet Union]], in 1939, his family escaped eastwards into the USSR. Bauman then enlisted in the Soviet-controlled [[First Polish Army (1944-1945)|First Polish Army]], working as a political instructor. He took part in the battles of [[Battle of Kolberg (1945)|Kolberg]] (now Kołobrzeg) and of [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin]]. In May 1945 he was awarded the Military [[Cross of Valour (Poland)|Cross of Valour]]. After World War II he became one of the [[Polish Army]]'s youngest majors.

According to the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]], from 1945 to 1953 Bauman was a political officer in the [[Internal Security Corps]] (KBW), a military unit formed to combat [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|Ukrainian nationalist insurgents]] and part of the remnants of the [[Polish Home Army]].&lt;ref name="ipn.gov.pl"&gt;Piotr Gontarczyk: [http://ipn.gov.pl/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/47281/1-7151.pdf ''Towarzysz "Semjon". Nieznany życiorys Zygmunta Baumana''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829041905/http://ipn.gov.pl/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/47281/1-7151.pdf|date=29 August 2013}} "Biuletyn IPN", 6/2006. S. 74–83&lt;/ref&gt; Later Bauman worked for military intelligence from 1945 to 1948. However, the nature and extent of his collaboration remain unknown, as well as the exact circumstances under which it was terminated.&lt;ref name="ipn.gov.pl"/&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Bauman confirmed he had been a committed communist during and after World War II and had never made a secret of it. He admitted that joining the military intelligence service at age 19 was a mistake although he had a "dull" desk-job and did not remember informing on anyone.&lt;ref&gt;Aida Edemariam, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/28/academicexperts.highereducation "Professor with a past"], ''The Guardian'', 28 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'' piece erroneously claimed that the ''Brickhouse article'', to which it referred, was written by [[Bogdan Musiał]], a conservative Polish historian working in Germany. In fact, it was written by the Institute of National Remembrance employee, Piotr Gontarczyk; Musiał had simply repeated Gontarczyk's findings in the German ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; While serving in the [[Internal Security Corps|KBW]], Bauman first studied sociology at the Warsaw Academy of Political and Social Science. In the KBW Bauman, already in the rank of major, was suddenly dishonourably discharged in 1953, after his father had approached the Israeli embassy in Warsaw with a view to emigrating to [[Israel]]. As Bauman did not share his father's [[Zionism|Zionist]] tendencies and was indeed strongly anti-Zionist, his dismissal caused a severe, though temporary estrangement from his father. During the period of unemployment that followed, he completed his M.A. and in 1954 became a lecturer at the [[University of Warsaw]], where he remained until 1968.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

During a spell at the [[London School of Economics]], where his supervisor was [[Robert McKenzie (psephologist)|Robert McKenzie]], he prepared a comprehensive study on the British socialist movement, his first major book. Published originally in Polish in 1959, a revised edition appeared in English in 1972. Bauman went on to publish other books, including ''Socjologia na co dzień'' ("Everyday Sociology", 1964), which reached a large popular audience in Poland and later formed the foundation for the English-language text-book ''Thinking Sociologically'' (1990). Initially, Bauman remained close to orthodox [[Marxism|Marxist]] doctrine, but influenced by [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Georg Simmel]], he became increasingly critical of Poland's Communist government. Owing to this he was never awarded a [[professorship]] even after he completed his [[habilitation]] but, after his former teacher, [[Julian Hochfeld]], was made vice-director of [[UNESCO]]'s Department for Social Sciences in Paris in 1962, Bauman did in fact inherit Hochfeld's chair.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Faced with increasing political pressure connected with a political purge led by [[Mieczysław Moczar]], the Chief of the [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa|Polish Communist Security Police]], Bauman renounced his membership of the governing [[Polish United Workers' Party]] in January 1968. The [[March 1968 events]] culminated in a purge that drove many remaining Communist Poles of Jewish descent out of the country, including those intellectuals who had fallen from grace with the [[Polish communism|communist]] government.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Bauman, who had lost his chair at the [[University of Warsaw]], was among them. Having had to give up Polish citizenship to be allowed to leave the country, he first went to [[Israel]] to teach at [[Tel Aviv University]], before accepting the chair of sociology at the University of Leeds, where he intermittently also served as head of department. After his appointment, he published almost exclusively in English, his third language, and his reputation grew. Indeed, from the late 1990s, Bauman exerted a considerable influence on the [[Anti-globalization|anti-]] or [[alter-globalization]] movement.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In a 2011 interview in the Polish weekly, "[[Polityka]]", Bauman criticised Zionism and Israel, saying Israel was not interested in peace and that it was "taking advantage of the Holocaust to legitimize unconscionable acts". He compared the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] to the walls of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] where hundreds of thousands of Jews had died in the Holocaust. The Israeli ambassador to Warsaw, Zvi Bar, called Bauman's comments "half truths" and "groundless generalizations."&lt;ref&gt;Roman Frister, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/polish-jewish-sociologist-compares-west-bank-separation-fence-to-warsaw-ghetto-walls-1.381828 Polish-Jewish sociologist compares West Bank separation fence to Warsaw Ghetto walls], ''[[Haaretz]]'', 1 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bauman was a supporter of the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organisation which advocates for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/supporters/overview/?mapcountry=allpro&amp;mapgroup=pro|title=Overview|first=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=9 October 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Bauman was married to writer [[Janina Bauman]], née Lewinson; 18 August 1926 – 29 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wyborcza.pl/1,75475,7405822,Janina_Bauman_nie_zyje.html Janina Bauman nie żyje], ''Gazeta Wyborcza''. Retrieved 10 January 2017.{{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had three daughters, painter Lydia Bauman, architect [[Irena Bauman]], and professor Anna Sfard, a leading theorist of education at the University of Haifa. His grandson [[Michael Sfard]] is a prominent civil rights lawyer and author in Israel. Zygmunt Bauman died in Leeds on 9 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/zygmunt-bauman-sociologist-who-wrote-identity-in-the-modern-world-dies-at-91/2017/01/09/ba6f821e-d6b2-11e6-b8b2-cb5164beba6b_story.html|title=Zygmunt Bauman, sociologist who wrote identity in the modern world, dies at 91|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Bauman's published work extends to 57 books and well over a hundred articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/sociology/people/baumanbibliog.htm |title=Academic Staff " Sociology and Social Policy " University of Leeds |publisher=University of Leeds|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these address a number of common themes, among which are [[globalisation]], [[modernity]] and [[postmodernity]], [[consumerism]], and [[morality]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Early work===
Bauman's earliest publication in English is a study of the British [[labour movement]] and its relationship to class and [[social stratification]], originally published in Poland in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;''Between Class and Élite. The Evolution of the British Labour Movement: A Sociological Study''. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1972.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to publish on the subject of class and social conflict until the early 1980s. His last book was on the subject of ''Memories of Class''.&lt;ref&gt;''Memories of Class: The Pre-History and After-Life of Class''. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst his later books do not address issues of class directly, he continued to describe himself as a socialist, and he never rejected [[Marxism]] entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Bunting, "Passion and pessimism".

===Modernity and rationality===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
In the late 1980s and early 1990s Bauman published a number of books that dealt with the relationship between modernity, bureaucracy, rationality and social exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;See in particular ''Modernity and Ambivalence'', Cambridge: Polity, 1991, and ''Modernity and the Holocaust'', Cambridge: Polity/Blackwell, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Bauman, following [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], came to view European modernity as a trade off: European society, he argued, had agreed to forego a level of freedom to receive the benefits of increased individual security. Bauman argued that modernity, in what he later came to term its 'solid' form, involved removing unknowns and uncertainties. It involved control over nature, hierarchical bureaucracy, rules and regulations, control and categorisation — all of which attempted to remove gradually personal insecurities, making the chaotic aspects of human life appear well-ordered and familiar. 
[[File:Zygmunt Bauman, fot. M. Oliva Soto (6144135392).jpg|thumb|Bauman in 2011]]
Later in a number of books Bauman began to develop the position that such order-making never manages to achieve the desired results. When life becomes organised into familiar and manageable categories, he argued, there are always social groups who cannot be administered, who cannot be separated out and controlled. In his book ''Modernity and Ambivalence'' Bauman began to theorise about such indeterminate persons in terms of an allegorical figure he called, 'the stranger.' Drawing upon Georg Simmel's sociology and the philosophy of [[Jacques Derrida]], Bauman came to write of the stranger as the person who is present yet unfamiliar, society's ''undecidable''. In ''Modernity and Ambivalence'' Bauman attempted to give an account of the different approaches modern society adopts toward the stranger. He argued that, on the one hand, in a consumer-oriented economy the strange and the unfamiliar is always enticing; in different styles of food, different fashions and in tourism it is possible to experience the allure of what is unfamiliar. Yet this strange-ness also has a more negative side. The stranger, because he cannot be controlled or ordered, is always the object of fear; he is the potential mugger, the person outside of society's borders who is a constant threat.

Bauman's most famous book, ''Modernity and the Holocaust'', is an attempt to give a full account of the dangers of those kinds of fears. Drawing upon [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Theodor Adorno]]'s books on totalitarianism and the Enlightenment, Bauman developed the argument that the Holocaust should not simply be considered to be an event in Jewish history, nor a regression to pre-modern barbarism. Rather, he argued, the Holocaust should be seen as deeply connected to modernity and its order-making efforts. Procedural rationality, the division of labour into smaller and smaller tasks, the taxonomic categorisation of different species, and the tendency to view obedience to rules as morally good, all played their role in the Holocaust coming to pass. He argued that for this reason modern societies have not fully grasped the lessons of the Holocaust; it tends to be viewed—to use Bauman's metaphor—like a picture hanging on the wall, offering few lessons. In Bauman's analysis the Jews became 'strangers' ''par excellence'' in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''Modernity and the Holocaust'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Final Solution]] was pictured by him as an extreme example of the attempt made by society to excise the uncomfortable and indeterminate elements that exist within it. Bauman, like the philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]], contended that the same processes of exclusion that were at work in the Holocaust could, and to an extent do, still come into play today.

===Postmodernity and consumerism===
In the mid-to-late 1990s, Bauman began to explore ''postmodernity'' and ''consumerism''.&lt;ref&gt;''Work, Consumerism and the New Poor'', Open University, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; He posited that a shift had taken place in modern society in the latter half of the 20th century. It had changed from a society of producers into a society of consumers. According to Bauman, this change reversed Freud's "modern" tradeoff—i.e., security was given up in exchange for more freedom, freedom to purchase, consume, and enjoy life. In his books in the 1990s Bauman wrote of this as being a shift from "modernity" to "post-modernity". 

Since the turn of the millennium, his books have tried to avoid the confusion surrounding the term "postmodernity" by using the metaphors of "liquid" and "solid" modernity. In his books on modern consumerism, Bauman still writes of the same uncertainties that he portrayed in his writings on "solid" modernity; but in these books he writes of fears becoming more diffuse and harder to pin down. Indeed, they are, to use the title of one of his books, "liquid fears" – fears about [[paedophilia]], for instance, which are amorphous and have no easily identifiable reference.&lt;ref&gt;See ''In Search of Politics'', Polity, 1999.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, publisher, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Bauman is credited with coining the term [[allosemitism]] to encompass both [[philo-Semitic]] and [[anti-Semitic]] attitudes towards Jews as the [[Other (philosophy)|other]].&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Valerie. "Dissolving Boundaries: Assimilation and Allosemitism in E. A. Dupont's "Das Alte Gesetz" (1923) and Veit Harlan's "Jud Süss" (1940)", ''The German Quarterly'' 78.4 (2005): 496–516.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Briefel, Aviva. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40959717 "Allosemitic Modernism"], NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction 43, no. 2 (2010): 361–63], Jstor.org. Retrieved 9 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Bauman reportedly predicted the negative political effect that social media have on voter's choice by denouncing them as 'trap' where people only 'see reflections of their own face'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/19/inenglish/1453208692_424660.html|title=Zygmunt Bauman: "Social media are a trap|last=De Querol|first=Ricardo|date=25 January 2016|publisher=El Pais}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
Bauman was awarded the [[European Amalfi Prize for Sociology and Social Sciences]] in 1992 and the [[Theodor W. Adorno Award]] of the city of [[Frankfurt]] in 1998. He was awarded in 2010, jointly with [[Alain Touraine]], the ''[[Princess of Asturias Awards|Príncipe de Asturias Prize]]'' for Communication and the Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpa.es/en/press/news/alain-touraine-and-zygmunt-bauman-prince-of-asturias-award-for-communication-and-humanities/ Press release: ''Prince of Asturias Awards: Alain Touraine and Zygmunt Bauman, Prince of Asturias Award for Communication and Humanities''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531174332/http://www.fpa.es/en/press/news/alain-touraine-and-zygmunt-bauman-prince-of-asturias-award-for-communication-and-humanities|date=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Leeds established 'The Bauman Institute' within its School of Sociology and Social Policy in his honour in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sociology.leeds.ac.uk/bauman |title=The Bauman Institute|publisher=University of Leeds|date=20 June 2014|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Lower Silesia, a small private higher education institution in Lower Silesia, [[Poland]], planned to award Bauman an honorary doctorate in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/kultur/article119301822/Ehrendoktor-mit-Hindernissen.html|title=Ehrendoktor mit Hindernissen|first=Gerhard|last=Gnauck|work=Die Welt|date=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a reaction to a major anti-communist and what Bauman supporters allege "anti-semitic" uproar against him, he eventually rejected the award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/110471/leeds-professor-rejects-polish-award-over-antisemitic-slurs "Leeds professor rejects Polish award over antisemitic slurs"], ''The Jewish Chronicle''.

In 2015 the [[University of Salento]] awarded Bauman an honorary degree in Modern Languages, Literature and Literary Translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unisalento.it/web/guest/393/-/news/viewDettaglio/57840893/10122|title=Laurea honoris causa a Zygmunt Bauman: materiali (Honorary degree to Zygmunt Bauman: resources)|date=17 April 2015|accessdate=9 January 2017|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
In 2014, Peter Walsh, a PhD candidate at the [[University of Cambridge]], accused Bauman of plagiarism from several websites, including Wikipedia, in his book ''Does the Richness of the Few Benefit Us All?'' (2013). In this book Bauman is said to have copied verbatim paragraphs from Wikipedia articles on [[Slow Food]] and [[steady-state economy]], along with their bibliography, without attributing sources, authors or the fact that they were copied from Wikipedia. He did use a paragraph from the article on the [[golden handshake]], but this citation was properly attributed to Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KOMPROMITACJE: Zygmunt Bauman przepisuje z Wikipedii albo wielka nauka i małe machlojki|url=http://kompromitacje.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/bauman-przepisuje-z-wikipedii.html|website=kompromitacje.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a response Bauman suggested that "obedience" to "technical" rules was unnecessary, and that he "never once failed to acknowledge the authorship of the ideas or concepts that I deployed, or that inspired the ones I coined".&lt;ref name="plagiarism"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jump|first=Paul|title=Zygmunt Bauman rebuffs plagiarism accusation|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/zygmunt-bauman-rebuffs-plagiarism-accusation/2012405.article|accessdate=3 April 2014|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a detailed critique of Walsh and co-author David Lehmann, cultural critics Brad Evans and Henry A. Giroux concluded: "This charge against Bauman is truly despicable. It's a reactionary ideological critique dressed up as the celebration of method and a back-door defence of a sterile empiricism and culture of positivism. This is a discourse that enshrines data, correlations, and performance, while eschewing matters of substance, social problems, and power."&lt;ref&gt;Brad Evans and Henry A. Giroux, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/08/27/self-plagiarism-and-the-politics-of-character-assassination-the-case-of-zygmunt-bauman "Self-Plagiarism and the Politics of Character Assassination: the Case of Zygmunt Bauman"], ''CounterPunch'', 27 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
