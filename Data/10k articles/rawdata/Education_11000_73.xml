'''''{{lang|de|[[Abitur]]}}'' after twelve years''', or '''''{{lang|de|[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]}}'' in eight years''' (often abbreviated as ''G8'' or ''Gy8'') describes the reduction from the duration in the {{lang|de|Gymnasium}} from nine to eight school years in many of the [[States of Germany]]. In the States [[Berlin]], [[Brandenburg]] and [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] the reduction took place from seven to six years because, there, [[primary education]] goes until grade 6. The principal argument for the reduction are the comparatively long times for [[vocational education]] in [[Germany]].

In [[Saxony]] and [[Thuringia]] it is, however, already a long established norm to take the {{lang|de|Abitur}} after twelve years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/schulspiegel/wissen/0,1518,534437,00.html {{lang|de|Spiegel Online}}: {{lang|de|Im Osten nichts Neues}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some German federal states already reverse the reform even though sound academic insights on reform effects are scarce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.497011.de/presse/diw_roundup/empirische_befunde_zu_auswirkungen_der_g8_schulzeitverkuerzung.html Huebener, M. &amp; Marcus, J.

== Criticism ==
In part, parents’, teachers’ and students’ organizations express criticism, exclusively from the [[Western Germany|Western States of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,528522,00.html {{lang|de|Spiegel Online}}: {{lang|de|Diebstahl der Kindheit}}]&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the removal of one school year, all contents of the, now thirteen, school years are arranged. This means that the [[school timetable]] is enlarged and that the students have to be at school between 32 and 40 periods a week. Altogether with the homework given and exam preparations a school week is calculated to include an estimate of 45 up to 55 periods.

However, there is little empirical evidence on the effect of this compression of instructional hours into fewer years of schooling on student outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.497011.de/presse/diw_roundup/empirische_befunde_zu_auswirkungen_der_g8_schulzeitverkuerzung.html Huebener, M. &amp; Marcus, J.

'''Arthur Li Kwok-cheung''', [[Grand Bauhinia Medal|GBM]], [[Gold Bauhinia Star|GBS]] [[justice of the peace|JP]] ({{zh-t|李國章}}; born 27 June 1945) is a Hong Kong doctor and politician. He is currently member of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]] of the Hong Kong [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]] and the chairman of the Council of the [[University of Hong Kong]] (HKU). He was Vice-Chancellor of the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (CUHK) from 1996 to 2002 and [[Secretary for Education and Manpower]] from 2002 to 2007. Li’s dictatorial and ruthless leadership style led some to refer to him as "King Arthur" and even "the Tsar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five things to know about Arthur Li’s appointment as HKU council chairman|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1896777/five-things-know-about-arthur-lis-appointment-hku-council|date=31 December 2015|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the grandson of the co-founder of the [[Bank of East Asia]], Li Koon-chun, and brother of its current chairman, [[David Li]].

==Life and career==
Li was born into the prominent Li family. His grandfather, Li Koon-chun, was the founder of the [[Bank of East Asia]]. His father, [[Li Fook-shu]], was the unofficial member of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]] and [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]]. His brother, [[David Li Kwok-po]], succeeded his father to become the chairman of the Bank of East Asia and member of the Legislative Council.

An alumnus of [[St. Paul's Co-educational College]] and a classmate of Professor [[Lawrence J. Lau]], Li received his medical training at the University of Cambridge. He was subsequently trained at [[Middlesex Hospital Medical School]] and [[Harvard Medical School]], before returning to Hong Kong to become the founding chairman of the Department of Surgery and Dean of Medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Li's tenure as Secretary for Education and Manpower was marked by an era of education reforms that included the [[School-Based Management Policy]]. Since 2000, the Education and Manpower Bureau has implemented a number of mandates, including having teachers spend more time with students outside the classroom, adding exams for subjects such as English and history, and ordering that teachers take benchmark assessments to prove their language abilities. Li ostensibly retired from public service in 2007.

In the role, he caused controversy by proposing mergers first between [[Chinese University of Hong Kong|Chinese University]] and [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]], and later between Chinese University and the [[Hong Kong Institute of Education]].&lt;ref name=SCMPchmn/&gt;

Li's appointment by [[CY Leung]] to the governing board of the [[Hong Kong University|University of Hong Kong]] in 2015 has been met with strong criticism, particularly from academic staff (mostly pro-democrats): a poll has shown most to have little to no confidence that Li will uphold academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rthk.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/news.htm?englishnews&amp;20150321&amp;56&amp;1086109 Arthur Li made a HKU council member], RTHK, 21 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejinsight.com/20150423-most-hku-staff-have-no-confidence-in-arthur-li-poll-shows Most HKU staff have no confidence in Arthur Li, poll shows], EJ Insight, 23 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Li's general attitude towards staff has been said to be 'hostile' and 'critical'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AJJbdw1RHY "昨晚政府刊憲委任一向仇視港大的李國章做校委會主席，引起港大校友和師生不滿。" 多名校委不滿李國章入主港大 陳祖為批政府一意孤行]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Li had weeks earlier blamed the drop in international ranking of local universities on "academics who would rather appear in talk shows than do their job of teaching" [http://www.ejinsight.com/20150423-most-hku-staff-have-no-confidence-in-arthur-li-poll-shows Most HKU staff have no confidence in Arthur Li, poll shows], EJ Insight, 23 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, upon appointment he promptly criticised HKU professors for having "become intellectually incompetent".[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1757525/hku-professors-insulted-king-arthur-lis-claims-over-slip-academic HKU Professors Insulted], South China Morning Post, 6 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months later, when it became known that Li was likely to take over the chairmanship of the Council upon the expiry of the term of [[Edward Leong]] on 6 November, there was further strong opposition, with 87 percent of members of HKU Academic Staff Association and almost three-quarters of members of the Professional Teachers Union opposed,&lt;ref name=SCMPchmn&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/1872028/university-hong-kong-alumni-vow-action-stop-ex University of Hong Kong alumni vow action to stop ex-minister Arthur Li taking over as chairman of ruling council], SCMP, 25 Oct 2015&lt;/ref&gt; due to his stance during the [[University of Hong Kong pro-vice-chancellor selection controversy]].

=== Reputation ===
His leadership style has seen him being referred to as "King Arthur" or even "the Tsar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1721258/king-arthur-li-tipped-hong-kongs-next-chief-executive|title='King' Arthur Li tipped as Hong Kong's next chief executive|date=22 February 2015|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
He was married to Diana Chester, a registered nurse and graduate of New Hall College, Cambridge University who died in 2013. He has two sons.

==Appointments==
Before his appointment, Li was Vice-Chancellor of the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (CUHK), as well as:

'''Azerbaijan Medical University''', named after Nariman Narimanov ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Tibb Universiteti}}) is the formal name of the [[public university|public]] [[medical school]] located in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]].  Due to difficulties with translation, the school is sometimes called: Azerbaijan Medical University, Azerbaijan State Medical University, Azerbaijan State Medical Institute, or simply Medical University, with any of the preceding including the "named after N. Narimanov" or full "Nariman Narimanov".  The school is named after [[Nariman Narimanov]], a famous Azeri in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] politics, notably party chairman of the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union]].

Founded in 1930, the medical school grew out of the Department of Medicine of [[Baku State University]].  The school has 8000 students in 74 academic departments, with a faculty of scientists, physicians and lecturers numbering just over 1000. There are 4 clinics, educational-dental, oncologic, educational-therapeutic clinic, educational-surgical functioning within the university.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amu.edu.az/en/pages/2/12|title=Azərbaycan Tibb Universiteti|website=www.amu.edu.az|language=ru|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education''' ('''CCNE''') is an autonomous [[nursing education]] accrediting agency that contributes to the improvement of the public's health. The CCNE is recognized by the [[U.S. Secretary of Education]] as a [[Nationally recognized accrediting agencies in the United States|national accreditation agency]].

CCNE accreditation is a voluntary, self-regulatory process, and the organization encourages and supports nursing education programs to perform self-assessments to grow and improve their collegiate professional education.

In 1996, the [[American Association of Colleges of Nursing]] (AACN), as the national advocacy organization for America's baccalaureate and higher-degree nursing education programs, created the autonomous accrediting arm of the organization, the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE).

The CCNE is the only nursing education accrediting agency dedicated  exclusively to the accreditation of bachelor's and graduate-degree nursing education programs.

The AACN represents more than 592 schools of nursing at public and private universities and senior colleges nationwide, and which offer a variety of baccalaureate, graduate, and post-graduate programs.

Craft Alliance was founded in 1964 as a cooperative gallery, operated by regional craft-based artists in the city of St. Louis. By 1966, Craft Alliance was offering visual arts classes to the community and presenting exhibitions of contemporary craft in the gallery. In 1969 Craft Alliance moved to its present location at the western end of the [[Delmar Loop]] in [[University City, Missouri|University City]] — at that time an economically depressed street on the border between St. Louis City and [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]]. By 2007, The [[American Planning Association]] had designated the Delmar Loop as one of "10 Great Streets in America" through its Great Places in America program because of "the sustained efforts of local business, government and the community to achieve successful physical and economic revitalization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.planning.org/greatplaces/streets/2007/delmarloop.htm|title=Delmar Loop: University City &amp; St Louis, Missouri|website=American Planning Association|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stlamerican.com/news/community_news/delmar-loop-one-of-great-streets-in-u-s/article_13353fd9-a6c5-5c8b-bbfe-01042c100b5d.html|title=Delmar Loop one of 10 'Great Streets' in U.S.|website=Stlamerican.com|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2007, Craft Alliance's Board of Directors elected to open a satellite facility in [[Grand Center, St. Louis|Grand Center]], the arts and entertainment district of St. Louis city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2007/05/07/story9.html|title=Craft Alliance to open new satellite office in Grand Center|website=Bizjournals.com|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located in the Kranzberg Building, Craft Alliance at Grand Center now complements Craft Alliance's University City facility by offering community outreach programs to St. Louis City children and teens, and educational courses for the public in clay, metals, graphics and textiles.

The '''EUR-ACE (European Accredited Engineer)''' Label is a certificate awarded to courses of study in Engineering that are accredited by authorized quality assurance and accreditation agencies in the [[European Higher Education Area]]. 

The [[European Network for Accreditation of Engineering Education]] (ENAEE) grants this authorization to agencies that accredit degree programs in Engineering in accordance with the European Framework Standards and ENAEE's Standards for Accreditation Agencies.

The EUR-ACE label may be awarded to First Cycle (Bachelor) and Second Cycle (Master) accredited degrees in [[Engineering]].

==History==

The European Standing Observatory for the Engineering Profession and Education (ESOEPE) was established in September 2000. Its aim was to improve systems of accreditation of engineering degree programs in Europe.

In 2004 ESOEPE submitted a proposal to the European Commission. This proposal envisaged the establishment of a quality label (the EUR-ACE Label) which could be awarded to engineering degree programs which had reached certain educational standards, as defined by their learning outcomes.

The proposal was accepted by the EU Commission and funding provided for the project.
ESOEPE was dissolved; ENAEE was established and implemented the EUR-ACE Project.

The EUR-ACE Project concluded on 31/03/2006 with the presentation of the results in a public workshop in which the EUR-ACE label was listed among the six EC-sponsored “European quality labels in higher education”.
.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecaconsortium.net/event/paris/doc/WG4-ECA position paper&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach to using learning outcomes in the ENAEE European Framework Standards has been corroborated in a number of publications and projects since the establishment of ENAEE.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/a-tuning-ahelo-conceptual-framework-of-expected-desired-learning-outcomes-in-engineering_5kghtchn8mbn-en?citeformat=ris&lt;/ref&gt;

.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wfeo-ceie.org/news1.php?downFile&amp;id=4/&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 19 November 2014, authorized agencies sign a Mutual Recognition Agreement whereby they  accept each other's accreditation decisions in respect of Bachelor and Master engineering degree programs which they accredit.

==Agencies authorised to award the EUR-ACE label==

As of 21 November 2017 ENAEE had authorised 15 agencies to award the EUR-ACE label, which has been awarded to some 2600 engineering degree programmes in 35 countries both within and outside of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enaee.trynisis.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education in Andorra''' is mandatory for all [[child]]ren aged 6 to 16.

==Primary and secondary education==
There are essentially three coexisting school systems in the country: [[France|French]], [[Spain|Spanish]], and [[Andorra|Andorran]].&lt;ref name=Horner&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hörner|first1=Wolfgang|last2=Döbert|first2=Hans|last3=Kopp|first3=Botho von|last4=Mitter|first4=Wolfgang|title=The Education Systems of Europe|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402048746|pages=32-34|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FI5hZqm2_0MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[France|French]] government partially subsidizes education in Andorra’s French-language schools; schools in the southern section, near [[Spain]], are supported by the church. The local language, [[Catalan language|Catalan]], has been introduced at a school under the control of the [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]].

39% of Andorran children attend Andorran schools, 33% French schools and 28% Spanish schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andorra's School System|url=https://andorraguides.com/school/system/|website=Andorra Guides|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Andorran schools follow the Spanish curriculum, and their diplomas are recognized by Spain.

Primary school enrollment in 2003 was estimated at about 89%; 88% for boys and 90% for girls. The same year, secondary school enrollment was about 71%; 69% for boys and 74% for girls. The pupil to teacher ratio for primary school was at about 12:1 in 2003; the ratio was about 7:1 for secondary classes.{{cn|date=July 2012}}

==Higher education==
The [[University of Andorra]] was established in July 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andorra|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/University-of-Andorra|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=20 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a small enrollment and mostly offers long-distance courses through universities in Spain and France. The majority of secondary graduates who continue their education attend schools in France or Spain.&lt;ref name=Horner /&gt; In 2003, about 8% of eligible adult students were enrolled in tertiary programs. Virtually the entire adult population is literate. Andorra also has a [[nursing school]] and a school of computer science. {{cn|date=July 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5303">'''Encaenia'''{{needs-IPA}} is an [[academic]] or sometimes ecclesiastical [[ceremony]], usually performed at [[college]]s or [[universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/encaenia |title=encaenia - Definition of encaenia |publisher=Yourdictionary.com |date=2012-04-04 |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/ yourdictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It generally occurs some time near the annual ceremony for the general conferral of degrees to students.  The word is from [[Latin]], meaning dedication or consecration, and is ultimately derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word "εγκαίνια", meaning a festival of renewal or dedication, and corresponds to the [[English language|English]] term ''commencement''.

The term was originally used to indicate the eight days of celebration for the dedication of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]], which celebration covered also to the discovering of the [[True Cross]] by Empress [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]] in 326.&lt;ref name="DSBE"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stokl ben Ezra | first = Daniel | title = The Impact of Yom Kippur on Early Christianity: The Day of Atonement from Second Temple Judaism to the Fifth Century | publisher = Mohr Siebeck | location = Tubingen Germany | year = 2003 | isbn = 3-16-148092-9|pages=290–291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was consecrated on September 13, 335, the Encaenia started on September 13, while the cross itself was brought outside the church on September 14 so that the clergy and faithful could pray before the True Cross ([[Feast of the Cross]]).

== United Kingdom ==
At certain universities, Encaenia is an annual ceremony typically involving the presentation of honorary degrees to distinguished [[alumni]] and to distinguished personages from the worlds of arts and sciences. In most British universities, it corresponds to part of [[Graduation]].

[[File:Encaenia 2009.jpg|thumb|The Chancellor of the [[University of Oxford]] leads Congregation out of the Sheldonian theatre after Encaenia 2009.]]

The most famous Encaenia is the ceremony at the [[University of Oxford]], which usually  takes place on the Wednesday of the ninth week of [[Trinity Term]] (i.e. a Wednesday in the latter part of June).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/university_year/encaenia/ |title=Encaenia and Honorary Degrees - University of Oxford |publisher=Ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preceding the ceremony is a procession of some of the participants to the [[Sheldonian Theatre]], inside which the main event takes place. Those who take part in the procession are the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]], [[Vice-Chancellor]], and [[Pro-Vice-Chancellor]]s, the Heads of Houses (i.e. the university's [[Colleges within UK Universities#Oxford and Cambridge|colleges]], societies, and [[Permanent Private Hall|halls]]), the four Heads of Division (i.e. the divisions of Humanities, Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences, Medical Sciences, and Social Sciences), holders of [[Higher doctorate|Higher Doctorates]] (i.e. those in [[Doctor of divinity|Divinity]], [[Doctor of Civil Law|Civil Law]], [[Doctor of medicine|Medicine]], [[Doctor of Letters|Letters]], [[Doctor of science|Science]], and [[Doctor of Music|Music]]), the [[Proctor#Oxford University|Proctors]], the Assessor, the [[Orator#Formal titles|Public Orator]], the [[Oxford Professor of Poetry|Professor of Poetry]], and the [[Registrar (education)|Registrar]], together with the outgoing President of the [[Oxford University Student Union]], and the Presidents of the [[Junior common room|Junior]] and [[Middle Common Room|Middle]] Common Rooms of the [[Colleges within UK Universities#Oxford and Cambridge|colleges]] to which the [[Proctor#Oxford University|Proctors]] and the Assessor belong.

The Encaenia is depicted in the film ''[[Shadowlands (1993 film)|Shadowlands]]'' and in the ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Morse]]'' episode "[[List of Inspector Morse episodes#Series 7: 1993|Twilight of the Gods]]", and is depicted in the [[Jeffrey Archer]] novel, ''[[Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less]]''.

== United States ==
At some institutions, encaenia is the evening shortly before [[Graduation|commencement]] on which the college honors the graduating class with awards and prizes following a procession of candidates and [[teacher|faculty]] in [[academic regalia]], often joined by [[trustees]] and administrators.  In the case of [[Fordham University]], the graduates in turn bid farewell in the persons of the class [[valedictorian]] and, in a humorous yet loving way, the honorary "Lord" or "Lady of the Manor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/academics/colleges__graduate_s/undergraduate_colleg/fordham_college_at_r/academic_advising/seniors/graduation_71007.asp#Encaenia |title=Senior Graduation Matters, Fordham College at Rose Hill (FCRH) - Fordham University |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gailene Stock''' [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] [[Member of the Order of Australia|AM]] (28 January 1946{{spaced ndash}}29 April 2014) &lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/gailene-stock-dancer-and-teacher-who-became-a-successful-if-controversial-director-of-the-royal-ballet-school-9318480.html|title=Dancer and teacher who became a successful, if controversial, Director of the Royal Ballet School|publisher=The Independent|location=London, UK|first=Martin|last=Childs|date=2 May 2014|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an Australian-born ballerina, teacher and Director of the [[Royal Ballet School]] in [[Covent Garden]].

==Early years==
Gailene Patricia Stock was born in [[Ballarat]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. She was the second of three daughters to Roy and Sylvia. She began dancing from the age of three. However, she contracted polio at the age of 8, which left her hospital in an iron frame for 18 months. Remarkably, she was back dancing again by the time she was 12, attending the school of Paul Hammond, formerly a leading soloist with the [[Borovansky Ballet]].

Two years later, however, she had another setback when she suffered serious injury - a fractured skull and jaw - following a collision between a cement lorry and her father's car; she was left in a coma for three days. She had been due to take her [[Royal Academy of Dance]] exam. Incredibly, she recovered and passed her exam with "commendation".&lt;ref name="brisbanetimes"/&gt;

==Rise to Principal Dancer==
In 1962, at the age of 16, Stock was awarded a Royal Academy of Dance scholarship to London's Royal Ballet School, but at the same time, Dame [[Peggy van Praagh]] had just founded [[The Australian Ballet]] and she decided to offer Gailene a job and so she deferred her London jaunt to the following year. After a year in London, she was offered a position with The Royal Ballet. She decided, however, to return to The Australian Ballet, where she spent 7 years, rising to [[principal dancer]] under director [[Robert Helpmann]].&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

When The Australian Ballet embarked on its first European tour in 1965, Stock was part of the company, and toured on subsequent tours, including one to the United States, during which many dancers sustained injuries. On that tour, Stock recalled, she did 69 performances in 69 days.

She later went on to dance for three years in Canada as [[principal ballerina]] with the [[National Ballet of Canada]] and the [[Royal Winnipeg Ballet]]. She was pursued to North America by an Australian colleague, Gary Norman, whom she married. The pair returned to Australian Ballet and resumed their dancing careers. After having their daughter in 1978 she moved into teaching and management. Stock then was named director of the [[National Ballet School|National Ballet School, Victoria]], and took on other administrative positions before being made director of the Australian Ballet School from 1990-98. In 1999 she was head-hunted to take over from Dame [[Merle Park]] as Director of the Royal Ballet School. She accepted the post with the proviso that her husband taught the boys at the school.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

==Return to London==
Gailene Stock moved to [[The Royal Ballet School]] in 1999, with her family. She immediately set to work changing the curriculum in order to make the student dancers more employment-ready upon graduation. When she joined, employment rates were around 48% and steadily rose to over 98% during her tenure.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

She opened the doors to students from all over the world, which angered many of the establishment within the English ballet.&lt;ref name="brisbanetimes"/&gt; Over her 15 years, she oversaw the splendid refurbishments of the school's junior and senior sections, achieving a much-praised move of the Royal Ballet School's senior section from dowdy [[Chiswick]] premises to an award-winning conversion next to the [[Royal Opera House]] in Covent Garden, and upgrading the younger section's accommodation in [[White Lodge]], [[Richmond Park]].&lt;ref name="brisbanetimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/comment/obituaries/gailene-stock-resilient-dancer-overcame-injuries-illhealth-and-insults-all-the-way-to-the-top-20140501-zr2e2.html|title=Resilient dancer overcame injuries, ill-health and insults, all the way to the top|newspaper=The Brisbane Times|location=Brisbane, Australia|date= 1 May 2014|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She served twice as the President of the Jury at the [[Prix de Lausanne]] (2003 and 2011) and also as a Jury Member for the [[Young America Grand Prix]].

==Family==
Gailene married fellow Australian and principal dancer Gary Norman while they were touring North America in 1977. Their daughter Lisa was born in 1978.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

==Honours==
In 1997, she was appointed a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] (AM) for services to ballet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=869921&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true It's an Honour].

The insignia was brought to her hospital bed, where she was being treated for cancer.

==Awards==
In 1998, Stock became the first Australian representative on the Executive and Artistic Committees of the [[Royal Academy of Dance]], London. In 2013, she received the Governors of The Royal Ballet Gold Medal.

==Health and death==
In 2013 Stock was diagnosed with a [[brain tumour]] and took leave from The Royal Ballet to receive treatment. She died a year later on 29 April 2014, aged 68.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

Upon hearing of her death, [[David McAllister (dancer)|David McAllister]], artistic director of the Australian Ballet, paid tribute to her. "She was a passionate, intelligent and dynamic dancer whose career saw her dance across the globe. Rising from one of the youngest dancers in the company to the rank of ballerina, she danced in all the major classical repertoire (and was) a part of the many important new creations during her time with the company."&lt;ref name="theaustralian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/stage/gailene-stock-dancer-with-a-mission/story-fn9d344c-1226901241187#|title=Gailene Stock: dancer with a mission|publisher=The Australian|location=Australia|date=1 May 2014|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McAllister added, "Her success continued after leaving the stage, as a teacher of note and an innovative ballet school director, notably at both the Australian Ballet School and more recently the Royal Ballet School. Her legacy lives on in the thousands of dancers whose careers she touched and nurtured during these prestigious positions."&lt;ref name="theaustralian"/&gt;

'''Irene Gilbert''' (born '''Irene Liebert or Liebeschutz'''; August 25, 1934 – May 21, 2011) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[United States|American]] actress and acting school director, who co-founded the  [[Stella Adler Studio of Acting#The Stella Adler Academy of Acting and Theatre, Los Angeles|Stella Adler Academy]] in [[Los Angeles]], with actress [[Joanne Linville]], in 1985.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Valerie J.|last=Nelson|title=Irene Gilbert dies at 76; cofounder of Stella Adler's Los Angeles acting academy|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/28/local/la-me-irene-gilbert-20110528|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2011-05-28|accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as the academy's director for around two decades after the its establishment.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite news|title=Actress Irene Gilbert ran LA acting academy|url=https://variety.com/2011/scene/people-news/irene-gilbert-dies-at-76-1118037742|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 31, 2011|accessdate=February 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Gilbert was born as Irene Liebert or Liebeschutz in [[Brandenburg|Brandenburg, Germany]] on August 25, 1934.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; She immigrated to [[New York City]] with her parents, Gaston and Lucie Liebert (or Liebeschutz), just before the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Her parents were killed by a [[drunk driver]] when she was just five years old. She was raised by her aunt and her four older brothers.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

==Career==
She changed her surname to Gilbert when she began her acting career, reportedly because she felt that it eemed "movie-star-esque."&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Her acting career extended into the late 1980s. Her [[television]] credits included roles in ''[[Cannon (TV series)|Cannon]]'', ''[[Barnaby Jones]]'', and ''[[Emergency!]]'' in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

Gilbert became friends with New York City-based acting coach [[Stella Adler]] during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; In 1985, Gilbert and actress [[Joanne Linville]] pursued Adler to open a branch of the [[Stella Adler Studio of Acting#The Stella Adler Academy of Acting and Theatre, Los Angeles|Stella Adler Academy]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

Gilbert also served as the school's director for 20 years.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; A fire at the school, which was originally located in a small theater at [[Hollywood Boulevard]] and Argyle Avenue, forced the school's temporary closure in 1991. The school's building was further threatened with [[demolition]] to make way for a [[Metro Rail (Los Angeles County)|proposed subway line]] at the time of Adler's death, in 1992.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

Gilbert moved and reopened the school in 1994 at a building which was once the Embassy Club, a [[private club]] in the 1930s at Hollywood Boulevard and [[Highland Avenue (Los Angeles)|Highland Avenue]].&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; She continued to teach acting at the school and produce stage productions. The Stella Adler Academy in Los Angeles named one of its theaters, the Irene Gilbert Theatre, in honor of her.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

==Death==
Married once, to Ronald Packenham Law, Irene Gilbert died, aged 76, from complications of [[Alzheimer's disease]], at the home of her son, Randall Garrett Herzon, in [[Eureka, California]].&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;

'''John Armstrong''' (born 1966) is a British writer and philosopher living in [[Hobart]], Australia.  He was born in [[Glasgow]] and educated at Oxford and London, later directing the philosophy program at the University of London's School of Advanced Study. Armstrong was philosopher in residence at the Melbourne Business School and senior adviser to the vice-chancellor of [[University of Melbourne|Melbourne University]] until 2014. In 2014 he became a professorial fellow at the [[University of Tasmania]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.utas.edu.au/provost/inglis-clark-centre/people/honorary-positions Division of the Provost: Honorary Positions]", [[University of Tasmania]]. Accessed 13 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He is author of several books on philosophical themes.

==Life and work==
Armstrong's work has covered a range of themes including art, beauty, and civilisation.  His work focuses on restoring traditional ways of thought by their modern application.  Positive reviews of Armstrong's books have noted his accessible style and the importance of reviving the concepts of which he talks.  Negative reviews have tended to criticise him for lacking a sense of history and irony.

{{Quote|The general task of this book is to elaborate the style of attention which works of art solicit.  The cultivation of such a style is of importance because it is in the quality of our engagement that the human worth of art is apparent--art matters in virtue of the kind of experience it invites the spectator into.  There is no access to art except in private--in looking, thinking, feeling as we stand before an individual work.  Cultivation requires that we draw upon our own resources of sensitivity, reverie and contemplation, our capacity to invest our ideals and interests in the process of looking.  Without these we can only know about art as detached observers who look on without being able to participate (like seeing people share a joke others don't quite catch).|John Armstrong, Move Closer: An Intimate Philosophy of Art}}

His recent work has focused around developing a philosophical description of the concept of civilisation and applying it in the context of modern business and the humanities. Armstrong proposes that civilisation can best be thought of occurring when material and spiritual prosperity come together and mutually help each other. He also defines civilisation as "the life-support system for high-quality relationships to people, ideas and objects".&lt;ref&gt;See page 26 of "In Search of Civilisation" 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is friends with [[Alain de Botton]] and the two have jointly authored the book ''Art as Therapy'' (2013). He works with [[The School of Life]] news website ''The Philosophers’ Mail''.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After teaching at [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans]] and [[Millikin University]] in [[Decatur, Illinois]], Williams came to Northwestern State University in 1966 as an assistant professor.  He became a full professor there in 1976.

==Work==
Over his 35 years at Northwestern State University Williams authored or co-authored 147 professional publications&lt;ref name="emeritus"/&gt; and received both NSU's Distinguished Faculty Award and their Alumni Association's Excellence in Teaching Award.&lt;ref name="emeritus"/&gt;

During his career, he specialized in studying the milk snake, ''Lampropeltis triangulum''.
In 1988, he published a book identifying 25 [[subspecies]] of milk snakes and which is considered seminal and cited by most papers on [[milk snakes]].&lt;ref name="Dongarra"&gt;{{citation

'''Kharkiv State Academy of Culture''' ({{lang-uk|Харківська державна академія культури}}) is a Ukrainian public academy in [[Kharkiv]].

==History==
The academy was created on September 10, 1929 as the '''Institute of Political Education''' out of the Kharkiv Institute of National Education (1921-1933) which was a temporary school in place of [[University of Kharkiv]]. In a year the school was renamed into the '''Kharkiv Institute of Political Education''' and next year - the '''All-Ukrainian Institute of Communist Education'''.

During that time the institute had seven departments: librarian, book marketing, scholar, museum, tourist, atheistic, and mass-agitation.

In July 1935 the institute was transformed into the '''Ukrainian Library Institute''' that included just two librarian departments. In 1939 the school was renamed into the '''Ukrainian State Library Institute'''.

During [[World War II]] the institute folded and once again became department of the [[University of Kharkiv]] which was evacuated to [[Kyzylorda]] in the [[Kazakh SSR]]. After the war it was once again reestablished in June 1947 back in [[Kharkiv]] as the '''State Library Institute'''. In 1950 there was opened a department of cultural education.

Finally in 1964 the institute was transformed into the '''Kharkiv State Institute of Culture'''.

After the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] many other departments were opened in the institute such as legal studies, musical folk art, culturology, choreography, foreign students relations and others. On June 8, 1998 the institute was renamed into the '''Kharkiv State Academy of Culture'''.

==History==
{{main|History of King Saud University}}
[[File:King Saud.jpg|thumb|[[Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Saud]] in 1957]]
Establishing [[Saudi Arabia]]'s first university was a response to the educational and professional needs of a young nation. [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Abdulaziz]] became king in 1932, and began laying the foundations for modernizing his country and establishing an educational system. In 1953 [[King Saud]], the eldest son of Abdulaziz, acceded to the throne upon his father's death, and instituted the Council of Ministers and the Ministry Education.

Prince Fahd, who eventually became the Saudi King, was the first minister of education. Following the first session of the Council of Ministers, he announced that the first Saudi University would be established as a house of culture and sciences. Prince Fahd said that he was committed to promoting higher education.

In 1957, according to the dictates of the Royal Decree No. 17, Prince Fahd announced the founding of King Saud University, established in order to, "Disseminate and promote knowledge in Our Kingdom for widening the base of scientific and literary study, and for keeping abreast with other nations in the arts and sciences and for contributing with them discovery and invention, in addition to reviving Islamic civilization and articulate its benefits and glories, along with its ambitions to nurture the young virtuously and to guarantee their healthy minds and ethics."

Students began studying at the College of Arts in the 1957-58 academic year. Since then KSU developed further according to the needs of the nation.

Between 1958 and 1960 the College of Sciences, the College of Business (now the College of Public Administration) and the College of Pharmacy were established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pharmacy.ksu.edu.sa/en/node/1424|title=College of Pharmacy|website=Pharmacy.ksu.edu.sa|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Royal Decree no. 112 of 1961 recognized that King Saud University was an independent legal entity, with a budget of its own, responsible for higher education, promoting scholarly research, and advancement of sciences and arts in the country. Naming the Minister of Education as the [[President]] of the university, the Statute ordered that the University have a Vice President and Secretary General, and that each [[college]] and institute have a [[Dean (education)|Dean]], Vice Dean, and a [[University Council|council]].&lt;ref name="ksu about history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ksu.edu.sa/en/about-ksu/history|title=History|website=Ksu.edu.sa|accessdate=28 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922121255/http://ksu.edu.sa/en/about-ksu/history|archive-date=22 September 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the College of Agriculture was established and KSU assumed control over the Colleges of Engineering and Education, formerly under the Ministry of Education in cooperation with [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfas.ksu.edu.sa/en/College%20in%20Brief|title=College in brief|website=Cfas.ksu.edu.sa|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Riyadh University ===
Royal Decree no M/11 of 1967 enforced the Statute of the University of Riyadh (currently King Saud University), rescinding all earlier statutes, bylaws, and regulations. Of the main landmarks of the new Statute is the creation of the Higher Council of the University as one of its administrative powers. The membership of the new council includes two active or inactive university Presidents, two faculty members who had assumed such positions outside the country, or two native leading intellectuals.

The Higher Council of the University is the dominant power over the university affairs: it draws out policies, issues decisions to implement and achieve the objectives of the university (especially those pertaining to the creation of new colleges and departments), proposes budgets, and systems of faculty salaries, annuities, and financial awards.

Royal Decree no M/6 of 1972 superseded the Statute of 1967. With the new Statute, the membership of the Higher Council of the University includes five active or inactive university Presidents, or native leading intellectuals. To the council are also added the University Secretary General and two other non-university members. Again, the Statute dictates the creation of an Academic Council overlooking scholarly research and studies. The Higher Council of the University issues the bylaws governing the number of the Academic Council's members, responsibilities, and powers.

These decrees were issued in response to the growing and widening needs of the university as the establishment of new colleges started. Between 1958 and 1960, three colleges were established: the College of Sciences, College of Business (now the College of Public Administration) and the College of Pharmacy. In 1961/1962 women were first admitted into the College of Arts and the College of Public Administration.

Five years later the College of Agriculture was established. In the same year the College of Engineering and College of Education, having been under the Ministry of Education in cooperation with the UNESCO, were annexed to the University. A year later (1969/1970) the College of Medicine opened. In 1974/1975 the Arabic Language Institute was inaugurated to serve non-Arabic speakers. At this time deanships of Admission and Registration, Students Affairs, Libraries were also established. Again, a year later (1976) the College of Dentistry and the College of Applied Medical Sciences were added to the Riyadh campus, while launching at the same time the Abha-based campus with the College of Education. In 1977, the Graduate College assumed its office in supervising and organizing all graduate programs in the various departments of the University.

At Abha, the College of Medicine was established according to Royal Order no. 3/M/380 of 1979 and was added to the University according to Royal Directive no. 15128 of 29 June 1400H. Formal study there started in the academic year of 1980/1981.

In 1980 another branch of the University opened at Qassim with three colleges: Agriculture, Veterinary Medicine, and Economics and Administration. Formal study started in 1980/1981 academic year.&lt;ref name="faculty alshuaibi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/alshuaibi/Pages/AboutKSUE2.aspx|title=King Saud University in Riyadh|website=Faculty.ksu.edu.sa|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== King Saud University ===
[[File:king saud university entrance.jpg|thumb|King Saud University entrance]]
In 1981, celebrating its 25th anniversary, the University of Riyadh went back to its original name of King Saud University at the orders of King Khalid bin Abdulaziz. In that year, too, the Deanship of Community Service and Continuing Education replaced the Center for Community Service, and King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH) was formally opened.&lt;ref name="ksu about history"/&gt;

Two years later (1983) two other colleges were created: the College of Computer and Information Science Sciences and the College of Architecture and Planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccis.ksu.edu.sa/en/ccis-history |title=A brief history|website=Ccis.ksu.edu.sa|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1990, the Institute of Languages and Translation was established to be turned four years later into the full-fledged College of Languages and Translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colt.ksu.edu.sa/ar/node/504|title=الرئيسيةعن الكليةتاريخ الكلية|website=Colt.ksu.edu.sa|language=ar|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the Royal ratification of the System of the Council of Higher Education and Universities was issued dictating that each university form its own Council which attends to its academic, administrative, and financial affairs, and carries out its general policy.

In 1996, the Council of Higher Education issued its decision no. 1282/A approving the creation of the Center for Consulting and Research which was renamed King Abdullah Center for Consulting and Research.

In 1997, Royal Decree no. 33 dictated the creation of a King Saud University Community College in Jazan, as well as the establishment of the College of Sciences at the Qassim campus.&lt;ref name="ksu about history"/&gt;

In 1998, Royal Order no. 7/78/M of 11 March 1419 decreed that [[King Khalid University]] be created in the south. The branches of [[Imam University]] and of King Saud University consequently formed the new university. In the same year, after the issuance of the unified regulations for Graduate Studies at Saudi universities, the Graduate College became the Deanship of Graduate Studies, and the Deanship of Academic Research was established in accordance with the dictates of the System of Academic Research issued that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/alshuaibi/Pages/aboutKSUEnglish.aspx |title=King Saud University in Riyadh|website=Faculty.ksu.edu.sa|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the College of Medicine was established at the Qassim campus, and the Deanship of Community Service and Continuing Education was turned into the College of Applied Studies and Community Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medicine.ksu.edu.sa/en/content/about-us|title=About us|website=Faculty.ksu.edu.sa|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Community College in Riyadh was inaugurated according to the Cabinet Council no. 73.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.ksu.edu.sa/en/node/102757|title=Program for disabled adults organized by Riyadh Community College|website=News.ksu.edu.sa|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the academic year of 2002/2003 the College of Science at Al-Jouf was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ju.edu.sa/index.php?id=780&amp;L=1|title=Overview|website=Ju.edu.sa|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year the College of Engineering was opened at the Qassim campus, and the creation of community colleges at Al-Majma’ah, Al-Aflaj, and Al-Qurayat was approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ksu.edu.sa/en/node/6|title=History|website=Ksu.edu.sa|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the academic year 2003/2004 the Qassim campus became an independent university. On 2003, the Council of Higher Education approved the promotion of the Department of Nursing, College of Applied Medical Sciences, into the College of Nursing.&lt;ref name="faculty alshuaibi"/&gt;

In 1982, Dr. [[Basil Al Bayati]] won the 1st prize in the King Saud Competition to build the main mosque for the university.  His design incorporated extensively the motif of the palm trunk, as used in the very first [[Mosque of the Prophet]] in [[Medina]].  It was highly praised and was even claimed to "mark the beginning of a new era, a new revival in Islamic architecture."&lt;ref name="revival"&gt;

[[File:Kings Saud University Entrance Gate, Riyadh.jpg|thumb|King Saud University Entrance Gate by Basil Al Bayati]]

As well as designing the mosque, Dr. [[Basil Al Bayati]] also designed the entrance gates to the university which are based upon the theme of faith and knowledge; two pillars of Islam that must be taken together, "Knowledge cannot do without faith nor can faith ignore knowledge for Islam calls always for faith and knowledge to run in parallel."&lt;ref name=conceptualist&gt;

===College of Science===
The College of Science was established in 1958, one year after the founding of King Saud University. In the beginning, the College had few students and a small number of lectures halls and laboratories.  In keeping with the growth of the university at large, the College has witnessed considerable progress in many respects.  The number of departments has increased, laboratories have improved, and the College now attracts a large number of students.As of today, the following bachelor's degrees are offered in the college of science:
[[Statistics]],
[[Operations Research]],
[[Geology]],
[[Geophysics]],
[[Chemistry]],
[[Biochemistry]],
[[Zoology]],
[[Botany]],
[[Microbiology]],
[[Mathematics]],
[[Financial Mathematics]],

===College of Engineering===
The College of [[Engineering]] was established as a joint project between the Ministry of Education of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and [[UNESCO]] in November 1962. This project lasted until 1969 when the College of Engineering became an official part of King Saud University.

The college started with three departments: the department of [[civil engineering]] (CE), the department of [[electrical engineering]] (EE), and the department of [[mechanical engineering]] (ME). In 1968, the department of [[architecture]] was established and it became a college in 1984 under the name the College of Architecture and Planning.

In 1974 two departments were established: the department of [[chemical engineering]] (CHE) and the department of [[petroleum engineering]] (PGE). In 1988 [[surveying engineering]] (SE) was also established as a program in the department of [[civil engineering]](CE). In 1982, the program of [[industrial engineering]] was established in the department of [[mechanical engineering]]. Later on the program became the department of industrial engineering (IE) in 2002. In sum, there are now seven departments offering the Bachelor of Science Degree in the following fields;

#[[Petroleum Engineering]]
#[[Chemical Engineering]]
#[[Surveying Engineering]]
#[[Civil Engineering]]
#[[Industrial Engineering]]
#[[Mechanical Engineering]]
#[[Electrical Engineering]]

The number of students of the college has risen from 17 in 1962 to more than 4000 students in 2005. The Faculty members have similarly grown in number from 4 to 210 (including lecturers and teaching assistants) within the same time span.

The university offers science and health major students 990 SR/month (264 $), and humanities students 840 SR/month (224 $), a 75% discount on foreign books, and fully furnished residences at the university housing/hostels complex, food within the university restaurant, free medical treatment, and full return tickets to their home country.

=== 2014 students death ===
In 2014, a student who suffered from a heart attack died on campus. The Saudi news outlet ''[[Okaz]]'' claimed that the campus' male ER staff was not allowed for more than an hour to enter the women-only campus where the patient was waiting, which subsequently caused her death, a story that created an outrage on campus and on social networks. Badran Al-Omar, the rector of the university, stated the opposite, assuring that the paramedics were allowed in the premises as soon as they arrived on site, and that the patient was treated with the best of care. However, the campus' paramedics failed to revive her and called for help from a local hospital who brought her to a care center nearby, stretching the total time of intervention to almost 2 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/10624556/Family-blames-Saudi-gender-segregation-rules-for-students-death.html|title=Family blames Saudi gender segregation rules for student's death|website=Telegraph.co.uk|date=7 February 2014|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/saudi-female-student-dies-after-male-ambulance-crew-denied-access-1.1287560|title=Saudi female student dies after male ambulance crew denied access|website=Gulfnews.com|date=6 February 2014|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lee S. Shulman''' (born September 28, 1938) is an American [[educational psychology|educational psychologist]].  He has made notable contributions to the study of [[teaching]], [[teacher quality assessment|assessment of teaching]], and the fields of [[medicine]], [[science]] and [[mathematics]].

==Background==
Shulman is a professor [[emeritus]] at [[Stanford Graduate School of Education]], past president of the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]], past president of the [[American Educational Research Association]], and the recipient of several awards recognizing his educational research. From 1963 to 1982, Shulman was a faculty member at [[Michigan State University]], where he founded and co-directed the Institute for Research on Teaching (IRT).

Shulman is credited with popularizing the phrase "pedagogical content knowledge" (PCK). He was the 2006 recipient of the [[University of Louisville]] [[Grawemeyer Award]] in Education for his 2004 book, ''The Wisdom of Practice: Essays on Teaching, Learning and Learning to Teach.'' &lt;ref name=grawemeyer.org&gt;{{cite web|title=2006- Lee Shulman|url=http://grawemeyer.org/education/previous-winners/2006-lee-shulman.html|website=grawemeyer.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610202927/http://grawemeyer.org/education/previous-winners/2006-lee-shulman.html|archivedate=2015-06-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK)==
Shulman (1986) claimed that the emphases on teachers' '''''subject matter knowledge''''' and pedagogy were being treated as mutually exclusive. He believed that teacher education programs should combine the two knowledge fields. To address this dichotomy, he introduced the notion of ''pedagogical content knowledge'' that includes pedagogical knowledge and content knowledge, among other categories. His initial description of teacher knowledge included curriculum knowledge, and knowledge of educational contexts.

Shulman also claimed that Sesame Street was the very best resource for teachers for expanding their pedagogical content knowledge.

The '''National Association for Campus Activities''' ('''NACA''') is an organization designed to provide information and resources for campus activities programmers throughout the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].  Formed in 1960, NACA links the higher education and entertainment communities in a business and learning partnership, creating educational and business opportunities for our student and professional members.

== National Association for Campus Activities ==
The National Association for Campus Activities (NACA) is a non-profit organization that hosts events which showcase [[musical artist]]s, [[comedian]]s, stage shows, and a variety of other acts. It is a member-based organization that works as the main connection between higher education institutions (called school members) and the entertainment community (called associate members). Through its regional conferences and National Convention, members of NACA have the opportunity to showcase their acts and meet with schools that are interested in having acts perform on their campus.

== History ==
NACA was founded in 1960. In 2010, it celebrated its [http://www.naca.org/Events/NationalConvention/Pages/default.aspx 50th Anniversary] at its annual National Convention.

== NACA Events ==
Each year there are [http://www.naca.org/Events/RegionalConferences/Pages/default.aspx seven regional conferences] and [http://www.naca.org/Events/NationalConvention/Pages/default.aspx one National Convention], as well as various [http://www.naca.org/Events/Pages/SummerInstitutes.aspx workshops and Webinars].

== National Convention ==
The National Convention is hosted each February. The four-day event provides networking opportunities with other campus activities professionals, students and the entertainment community. About 3,000 people attend the Convention each year, with hundreds of colleges and universities attending from around the United States. NACA’s National Convention is the nation's largest campus activities marketplace.

The Convention hosts more than 80 live performances ranging from music and comedy to lecture and interactive programs. Another aspect of the NACA conferences are the Educational Sessions with topics ranging from motivation, to leadership or even self beneficial workshops. These sessions focus on professional and student leadership development, programming, multicultural education, campus organization dynamics and advising, and identification of current trends in the field of campus activities. 

NACA’s Campus Activities Marketplace (CAMP) puts campus programmers in direct contact with the agents and/or artists. In the marketplace you can meet artists, watch small performances, get literature from the different agencies and get novelties personalized for you.

== Regions ==

NACA has seven regions:

'''The NACA West region''' includes [[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Idaho]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], [[New Mexico]], west of the 107th longitude (which roughly parallels the [[Rocky Mountains]]) and the Canadian Province of [[British Columbia]].

'''The NACA Northern Plains region''' includes [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], [[Wisconsin]], the Upper Peninsula of [[Michigan]], [[Nebraska]], [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]], [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], and the Canadian Provinces of [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]], and western [[Ontario]].

The '''Ohio River Trail''' ('''ORT''') is composed of two entities, the [[Ohio River Water Trail]] and the Ohio River Greenway Trail.  The Ohio River Greenway Trail is a proposed route that would interconnect existing trails in [[Maryland]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]] and [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ohiorivertrail.org/attachments/062_Biking,%20busing%20and%20buddying-up_Fewer%20commuters%20go%20it%20alone.pdf |title=Biking, busing and buddying-up: Fewer commuters go it alone |first=Michael |last=Pound |work=Beaver County Times |date=18 October 2009 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10126/1055757-57.stm |first=Brian |last=David |work=Pittsburgh Post Gazette |date=6 May 2010 |accessdate=7 May 2010 | title=Council formed to plan trail link along Ohio River}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal is spearheaded by the Ohio River Trail Council (ORTC), a [[Volunteering|volunteer-led]], [[non-profit organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohiorivertrail.org |title=Welcome to the Ohio River Trail Council |publisher=Ohio River Trail Council |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ORTC is an [[Internal Revenue Service]] registered [[501(c)(3)]] not-for-profit [[organization]] which relies on corporate, foundation, government, and private [[grants]] and [[donations]] to achieve its stated mission of creating a multi-use trail along the [[Ohio River]] and its [[tributaries]]. The Council is headquartered in [[Monaca, Pennsylvania|Monaca]], Pennsylvania.

== History ==
The Ohio River Trail Project was conceptualized on January 2, 2009, in coordination with [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Beaver County]] Planning Commission's Shared Greenways &amp; [[Environmental Planning|Environmental Planner]] Doniele Andrus; the Borough of Monaca Manager Mario Leone Jr;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11184/1157941-57-0.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Monaca in Beaver County becomes a model of sustainability | date=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dr. Vincent Troia.

On May 26, 2009, the Ohio River Trail Council (ORTC) was incorporated by Dr. Vincent Troia and Mario Leone, for the purpose of establishing a [[trail|multi-use trail]] along the Ohio River to promote the growth in River &amp; Trail towns of [[recreation]], [[health]], [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]], [[transportation]], [[cultural]] and [[historical]] [[amenities]], [[education]], charity, the protection and conservation of [[natural resources]] and to stimulate the local [[economy|economies]].

The Trail and its proposed connections were conceived by Dr. [[Vincent Troia]].

The Ohio River Trail Council began as a grass-roots effort to support a progressing state and national movement to develop greenways, especially since 1987 when [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan's]] Commission on "American Outdoors" recommended establishing a national greenways network.  Pennsylvania's statewide greenways program was established by Governor [[Tom Ridge]] in 2001 to promote and support the greenway efforts occurring in all [[List of counties in Pennsylvania|sixty-seven counties]].

== Proposed trails ==
The trail is proposed to run from the [[Beginning Point of the U.S. Public Land Survey|Point of Beginning]] (mile marker zero) at the OH-PA-WV state line near the Little Beaver Creek Greenway Trail, a segment of the Great Ohio Lake-to-River Greenway, to the [[Beaver River Trail]], the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] Trail via the [[Montour Trail]] in [[Moon Township, Pennsylvania]], the [[Three Rivers Heritage Trail]] in [[Pittsburgh]] and the [[Great Allegheny Passage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiorivertrail.org/attachments/124_Ohio%20River%20Trail%20Development%20in%20Allegheny%20County%202010.pdf |title=Ohio River Trail Council |publisher=Ohiorivertrail.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed ORT is a critical and missing link to nationally significant trail linkages in the [[tri-state area]] and is intended to become an important segment in a "mega-trail" from the [[Great Lakes]] region, through to [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kasp9HkrUs |title=Trail group hits the road |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Tri-state [[Greenway (landscape)|Greenway]], the ORTC also supports that the Ohio River Trail serve as part of the [[U.S. Bicycle Route System]] Route 50 and the [[Adventure Cycling Association]] Underground Railroad, Pittsburgh spur. The Ohio River Trail corridor is part of the [[National Park Service]]  [[Rivers of Steel]] [[National Heritage Area]].

The Ohio River Trail is intended to improve the quality of life of its users by providing [[Physical fitness|fitness]] and [[recreation]] opportunities. In addition, the ORT can serve as an alternative [[transportation]] [[Transport corridor|corridor]] between communities, as well as reducing vehicle [[Traffic congestion|congestion]] and [[pollution]]. Plans also exist to enable the [[disabled]] to comfortably make use of the trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11061/1128932-455.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first=Jon | last=Schmitz | title=Advocates fret new rules for hiking, biking trails | date=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project includes the reallocation of abandoned rail corridors, bridges, [[interurban]] or trolley lines, and canal [[towpath]]s as public multi-use trails. An emphasis exists on showcasing and preserving [[historical]] and [[cultural]] sites along the trail, alongside the establishment of an Ohio River Trail [[Museum]] and endorsement of the revitalization of the surrounding area.

The Trail is composed of thirty-one (31) [[Western Pennsylvania]] communities.

There are twelve (12) Ohio River North Shore communities: [[Glasgow, Pennsylvania|Glasgow]], [[Ohioville]], [[Midland, Pennsylvania|Midland]], [[Industry, Pennsylvania|Industry]], [[Vanport Township, Pennsylvania|Vanport Township]], [[Beaver, Pa|Beaver]], [[Bridgewater, Pennsylvania|Bridgewater]], [[Fallston, Pennsylvania|Fallston]], [[New Brighton, Pennsylvania|New Brighton]], [[Rochester, Pennsylvania|Rochester]], and [[Rochester Township, Pennsylvania|Rochester Township]].

In addition, the Ohio River North Shore Extension includes the eight (8) communities of [[Ambridge, Pennsylvania|Ambridge]], [[Baden, Pennsylvania|Baden]], [[Edgeworth, Pennsylvania|Edgeworth]], [[Freedom, Pennsylvania|Freedom]], [[Glen Osborne, Pennsylvania|Glen Osborne]], [[Harmony Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Harmony Township]], [[Leetsdale, Pennsylvania|Leetsdale]], and [[Sewickley, Pennsylvania|Sewickley]].  The Bradys Run Extension adds [[Patterson Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Patterson Township]] and [[Brighton Township, Pennsylvania|Brighton Township.]]

There are also ten (10) Ohio River South Shore communities: [[Monaca, Pennsylvania|Monaca]], [[Center Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Center Township]], [[Aliquippa, Pennsylvania|Aliquippa]], [[Hopewell Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Hopewell Township]], [[South Heights, Pennsylvania|South Heights]], [[Crescent Township, Pennsylvania|Crescent Township]], [[Moon Township, Pennsylvania|Moon Township]], [[Coraopolis, Pennsylvania|Coraopolis]], and [[Montour Railroad|Montour Junction]].  [[Neville Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Neville Township]] is the tenth community with the extension over the Neville Island Bridge.

The Ohio River Trail Council has also proposed and developed the [[Ohio River Water Trail]].  The Ohio River Water Trail consists of canoe, kayak and rowing access to the Ohio River and its tributaries.  Presently the Little Beaver Creek has access at Lock 57 Park in Ohioville, the Ohio River has access at Monaca, and the Beaver River has access at Bridgewater &amp; Rochester's Riverfront Park.  The ORTC supports the design, construction and the installation of a kayak and canoe launch site in these areas with amenities including signage and a canoe/kayak storage rack.

The project is expected to bring [[economic]] boons to [[Western Pennsylvania]] through the growth of the [[construction]] and maintenance industries, in addition to [[tourism|tourism-related]] opportunities such as [[rafting]] tours, bicycle sales and rentals, restaurants, and lodging.

== Current status ==

The campaign to build the [[rail trail]] that will eventually link [[Lake Erie]] with [[Washington, D.C.]] via [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Beaver County]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/pittsburgh/s_769709.html# |title= Beaver County trail would help connect Erie to nation's capital |first=Karen |last=Kadilak |work= Pittsburgh Post Gazette |location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |date=1 December 2011 |accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; has progressed to the point that the organizers, Vincent Troia and Mario Leone, are prepared to display their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ohiorivertrail.org/attachments/062_Plans%20coming%20together%20for%20Ohio%20River%20Trail.pdf |title=Plans coming together for Ohio River Trail |first=Michael |last=Pound |work=Beaver County Times |date=22 September 2009 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Beaver County Times]] [[journalist]] Michael Pound, regarding the status of the [[Ohio River]] Trail Project, the pair stated they have successfully solicited [[Resolution (law)|resolutions]] of support from the [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Beaver County]] communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reviewonline.com/page/content.detail/id/515711.html/ |title=County supports bike trail extension |first=Tom |last=Giambroni |work=The Review |location=East Liverpool, Ohio |date=21 June 2009 |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; through which the South Shore Trail would pass, and that they will soon have similar resolutions from the [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] communities.

The cost of the South Shore [[feasibility study]] is estimated at $50,000. Leone and Troia stated that the [[not-for-profit organization]] has already put together sufficient money for the match required for a grant from the [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]]. The feasibility study has been awarded to Stromberg, Garrigan &amp; Associates, and it is estimated to require six to ten months to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ohiorivertrail.org/attachments/062_Trail_building%20effort%20picks%20up%20steam.pdf |title=Trail-building effort picks up steam |first=Michael |last=Pound |work=Beaver County Times |date=4 May 2010 |accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 2010, the [[Ohio River]] Trail South Shore [[feasibility study]] began with a project steering committee meeting. The feasibility study for the south shore is expected to be completed in the spring of 2011 at a projected cost of $50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://post-gazette.com/pg/10196/1072829-57.stm |title=Ohio River Trail study nears end |work=Pittsburgh Post Gazette |first=Brian |last=David |date=15 July 2010 |accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10198/1073410-139.stm |title=A lot of good news for bicyclists to cheer about |work=Pittsburgh Post Gazette |first=Larry |last=Walsh |date=17 July 2010 |accessdate=19 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2010, the "Plant a Wish" project took place at the [[Beginning Point of the U.S. Public Land Survey|Point of Beginning]]. The project was intended to raise awareness of the Ohio River Trail effort, with participants from [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[West Virginia]] writing down their wishes on pieces of paper, which were then buried beneath the site of a newly planted tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reviewonline.com/page/content.detail/id/527793.html |title=Plant a Wish |work=The Review |date=10 June 2010 |accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reviewonline.com/page/content.detail/id/527793.html |title=Tri-state united for Plant a Wish |first=Katie |last=Schwendeman|work=The Review |date=13 June 2010 |accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped that the Point of Beginning will also host the beginning of a bike trail that would run up the Ohio River and conclude at [[Montour Trail|Montour Creek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://post-gazette.com/pg/10196/1072803-57.stm |title=Point of Beginning may get bike trail |work=Pittsburgh Post Gazette |first=Brian |last=David |date=15 July 2010 |accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 28, 2010, the Council was awarded a $10,000 grant by the [[Port of Pittsburgh Commission]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiorivertrail.org/attachments/160_ORTC_Port%20of%20Pittsburgh%20Commision%20Grant%2007_06_2010.pdf |title=Ohio River Trail Council |publisher=Ohiorivertrail.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on the understanding that it will be used to develop blueways and build bike and canoe racks at points in Rochester, Monaca, Bridgewater, and Ohioville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ohiorivertrail.org/attachments/124_Ohio%20River%20Trail%20Council%20receives%20$10,000%20grant.pdf |title=Ohio River Trail Council receives $10,000 grant |first=Michael |last=Pound |work=Beaver County Times |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10213/1076518-140.stm |title=Plan for water trail gets funding |first=John |last=Hayes |work=Pittsburgh Post Gazette |date=1 August 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/pittsburgh/s_693530.html |title=River users may get trails in waterways |first=Matthew |last=Santoni |work=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review |date=5 August 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of the North Shore feasibility study is estimated at $56,000.  On October 14, 2010 the Pennsylvania Department of Natural Resources (DCNR) awarded the Ohio River Trail a $29,000 grant for the North Shore Feasibility Study.   The North Shore Feasibility Study began in January 2011.  
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohiorivertrail.org/attachments/124_ORTC_DCNR%20North%20Shore%20Press%20Release%20October%2020,%202010.pdf |title=October 20, 2010 press release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2010 the Ohio River Trail Council (ORTC) and its partner the Borough of Monaca, PA along with three of its partner municipalities, Aliquippa, Coraopolis and Midland has received a grant for a $150,000 [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) Brownfields Area-Wide Planning Program Grant and Assistance to advance our ongoing regional brownfields revitalization. These municipalities have joined to undertake a grass-roots effort to re-think the future of our communities as a way to overcome the loss of a major portion of our manufacturing base and the post-industrial brownfields legacy that remains from that loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiorivertrail.org/attachments/124_ORTC_Monaca%20EPA%20Press%20Release%20February%202,%202011.pdf |title=Ohio River Trail Council |publisher=Ohiorivertrail.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 25, 2010, the [[National Park Service]] (NPS) Rivers, Trails, and Conservation (RTCA) Program approved an application for a technical assistance grant for the Ohio River Trail Council.  Over the next year, the NPS Rivers &amp; Trails staff will assist the ORTC with the completion of a Feasibility Study and to expand public involvement in the project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nps.gov/ncrc/programs/rtca/whatwedo/projects/PA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts are underway to communicate and collaborate with other trail groups, and to establish a Tri-State Trail Alliance in order to increase visibility and success of each smaller trail component of a greater linking trail system. The National Park Service is proud to support such a capable partner and eager to help contribute to the ORT Initiative.  Through the RTCA Program, the NPS helps communities and neighborhoods improve their important local resources, protect river resources, develop new trails and greenways and create and manage open space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiorivertrail.org/attachments/124_ORTC_NPS%20Press%20Release%20January%2018,%202011.pdf |title=Ohio River Trail Council |publisher=Ohiorivertrail.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In September of 2010, a planning grant was awarded to the Friends of the Riverfront to begin an effort to connect the Three Rivers
Heritage Trail from the City of Pittsburgh to Coraopolis. This eight mile segment will traverse through the City of Pittsburgh, McKees
Rocks, Stowe Township, Moon Township, Neville Township and Coraopolis. This effort will compliment the work of the Ohio River Trail Council and Lawrence and Beaver Counties, which have completed trail feasibility work outside of Allegheny County. Once feasibility work from the City of Pittsburgh to Coraopolis is complete, we will have a good understanding of the opportunity for trail development along the Ohio River all the way to Ohio. In Ohio, groups are working to connect to our trail here in Pennsylvania. You will see a lot more activity along the Ohio River in 2011." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friendsoftheriverfront.org/misc_docs/Riverfront%20Report%202010%20Web.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726065752/http://www.friendsoftheriverfront.org/misc_docs/Riverfront%20Report%202010%20Web.pdf |date=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Shore Feasibility Study which began on Jan 6, 2010 was completed in March 2011. The resultant Ohio River South Shore Trail is approximately 15.6 miles from Monaca to the beginning of the Montour Trail.

In 2011, the first year of assistance from the NPS, the RTCA assisted with the development of the Ohio River Water Trail and the Ohio River Land Trail feasibility studies.  In addition, the RTCA supported the ORTC in a multi-state effort,  which included eighteen counties in three states to link a system of trails in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. On March 29, 2011 a Tri-state Trail Alliance meeting of 80 trail advocates and on October 13, 2011 a regional trails meeting hosted by the Power of 32 occurred to support the vision of linking a system of trails in the tri-state area.

On October 25, 2010, the National Park Service (NPS) Rivers, Trails, and Conservation (RTCA) Program awarded a second year of technical assistance to the Ohio River Trail Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiorivertrail.org/attachments/161_ORTC_National%20Park%20Service%20RTCA%20Award%202011.pdf |title=Ohio River Trail Council |publisher=Ohiorivertrail.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the NPS Rivers &amp; Trails staff will focus on identifying an on-the-ground section of the Ohio River Land/Water Trail to develop and continue the oversight for the Tri-State Trail Initiative.

On April 6, 2011 the ORTC received a second grant from the Port of Pittsburgh Commission to establish a small [[watercraft]] [[launch (boat)|launch]] in [[Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiorivertrail.org/attachments/160_ORTC_Port%20of%20Pittsburgh%20Commission%20Grant%2004_06_2011.pdf |title=Ohio River Trail Council |publisher=Ohiorivertrail.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2011 the National Park Service approved the Ohio River Trail Council's application for a second year of technical assistance from the Rivers, Trails and Conservation Assistance Program. In the first year of assistance, RTCA assisted the Ohio River Trail Council (ORTC) with the development of the Ohio River Water Trail and the Ohio River Land Trail Feasibility Studies. In addition, the RTCA helped coordinate the March 29, 2011 Tri-state Trail Alliance meeting of about 80 trail advocates, and the October 13, 2011 regional trails meeting hosted by the Power of 32, to support the vision of linking a system of trails in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In 2012, the NPS Rivers &amp; Trails staff will focus on identifying an on-the-ground section of the Ohio River Land/Water Trail to develop, and continue the oversight for the Tri-State Trail Initiative, a multi-state effort which includes eighteen counties in three states. The Pennsylvania counties include Beaver, Crawford, Erie, Greene, Lawrence, Mercer and Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiorivertrail.org/attachments/124_Ohio%20River%20Trail%20receives%20second%20award%20from%20the%20National%20Park%20Service.pdf |title=Ohio River Trail Council |publisher=Ohiorivertrail.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/12001/1200291-140.stm| work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first=Shannon M. | last=Nass | title=Agencies partner on trail expansion | date=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ohio Counties include Ashtabula, Belmont, Columbiana, Jefferson, Mahoning, Monroe and Trumbull. The West Virginia counties include Brooke, Hancock, Marshall and Ohio.

On December 5, 2011 the Ohio River Trail Council, Beaver County Planning Commission and Midland hosted a public hearing regarding the feasibility study of a bicycle and pedestrian trail along the north side of the Ohio River. The proposed trail would connect with the planned Ohio River South Shore Trail at the Monaca-Rochester Bridge and continue to the Ohio-West Virginia state line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/regional/s_768895.html|title=Trail proposal due for public hearing|work=Pittsburgh Post Gazette |date=24 July 2011 | accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open learning''' is an innovative movement in education that emerged in the 1970s and evolved into fields of practice and study. The term refers generally to activities that either enhance learning opportunities within formal education systems or broaden learning opportunities beyond formal education systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02680510802625443#.UkCUrGRAQpt | title=Open Educational Resources: reviewing initiatives and issues | author=D'Antoni, Susan | journal=Open Learning | year=2009 | volume=24 | issue=1 (Special Issue) | pages=4 | doi=10.1080/02680510802625443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open learning involves but is not limited to: classroom teaching methods, approaches to interactive learning,&lt;ref name=Mason1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=Robin|title=Conference Report.

==Inception==

Open learning as a [[teaching method]] is founded on the work of [[Célestin Freinet]] in France and [[Maria Montessori]] in Italy, among others.
Open learning is supposed to allow pupils self-determined, independent and interest-guided learning. A prominent example is the language experience approach to teaching initial literacy (cf. [[Brügelmann]]/ [[Brinkmann]] 2011).
More recent work on open learning has been conducted by the German pedagogues [[Hans Brügelmann]] (1975; 1999), [[Falko Peschel]] (2002), [[Jörg Ramseger]] (1977) and [[Wulf Wallrabenstein]] (1991). The approach is supposed to face up to three challenges (cf. in more detail Brügelmann/ Brinkmann 2008, chap. 1):
* the vast differences in experiences, interests, and comptencies between children of the same age;
* the constructivist nature of learning demanding active problem-solving by the learner him- and herself;
* the legal requirement of student participation in decisions stipulated by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). of 1989.

'''PennPraxis''' is the "clinical" arm of the School of Design at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and is a [[501(c)|501c(3)]] non-profit subsidiary of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania.  The group offers community collaborative design opportunities for Penn faculty and students to test ideas and theories in practical "real world" applications while offering architectural and planning services to individuals and groups who are either in need or are otherwise unable to procure these services from traditional sources.  In its first 10 years it earned $16m in fees.&lt;ref name=an/&gt;

Requirements for project proposals are that the projects not meet the University's guidelines for "sponsored research projects"; they must also provide educational benefits and/or serve the interests of the (Philadelphia) community.  PennPraxis has been working on ideas for [[urban planning]] for the city of [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania according to a 'civic vision' it has for the city, including the [[Delaware River]] waterfront, and the western banks of the [[Schuylkill River]], where Penn's campus faces.

'''  Personal development planning''' is the process of creating an [[action plan]] based on awareness, values, reflection, [[goal-setting]] and planning for [[personal development]] within the context of a [[career]], education, relationship or for [[self-improvement]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exceptionality Without Relapse|last=Chinoperekweyi|first=Justine|publisher=Notion Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-947752-78-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''PDP''' (personal development plan), also called an IDP (individual development plan) or a PEP (personal enterprise plan), usually includes a statement of one's [[aspiration (long-term hope) | aspiration]]s, strengths or competencies, education and training, and stages or steps to indicate how the plan is to be realized. Personal development plans may also include a statement of one's career and [[lifestyle (sociology) | lifestyle]] priorities, [[career positioning]], analysis of opportunities and risks, and alternative plans (Plan B), and a ''[[curriculum vitae]]'' (CV).

In higher education, personal development plans typically include a portfolio containing evidence of the skills gathered over a particular timeframe. It is presumed{{by whom?|date=August 2015}} in education that undertaking PDPs will assist in creating self-directed independent learners who are more likely to progress to higher levels of [[Educational attainment|academic attainment]]. [[Human-resource management]] also uses PDPs. 

Personal development plans are often{{quantify|date=August 2015}} a requirement for employee CVs. Employees who participate in [[business training]] are often asked{{by whom?|date=August 2015}} to complete a personal development plan.

An individual can often{{quantify|date=August 2016}} develop a five-year personal development plan to organize personal [[goal]]s and to make them achievable within a certain{{which?|date=August 2015}} time-period.

The '''quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns''' ({{lang-fr|querelle des Anciens et des Modernes}}) began overtly as a [[literature|literary]] and artistic debate that heated up in the early 17th century and shook the [[Académie française]].

==Origins of the debate==
It was an essential feature of the European Renaissance to praise recent discoveries and achievements as a means to assert the independence of modern culture from the institutions and wisdom inherited from Classical (Greek and Roman) authorities. From the first years of the sixteenth century, one of the major reasonings used to this end by the most eminent [[Humanism|humanists]] ([[François Rabelais]], [[Girolamo Cardano]], [[Jean Bodin]], [[Louis LeRoy]], [[Tommaso Campanella]], [[Francis Bacon]], etc.) was that of the "Three Greatest Inventions of Modern Times" – the printing press, firearms, and the nautical compass – which together allowed the Moderns to communicate, exert power, and travel at distances never imagined by the Ancients.&lt;ref&gt;Boruchoff, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; When the quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns later arose in France, the "Three Greatest Inventions of Modern Times" would almost invariably be adduced as evidence of the Moderns' superiority.

The debate became known as 'a quarrel' after the frequently made [[pun]] on [[Charles Perrault]]'s title ''Parallel of the Ancients and the Moderns'', the French word 'querelle' being substituted for 'parallele'.

==Debate in France==
On one side of the debate were the Ancients (''Anciens''), led by [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]. The Ancients supported the merits of the ancient authors, and contended that a writer could do no better than imitate them. On the other side were the Moderns (''Modernes''), who opened fire first with [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]'s ''Le siècle de Louis le Grand'' ("The Century of Louis the Great," 1687), in which he supported the merits of the authors of the century of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and expressed the Moderns' stance in a nutshell:

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
::''La docte Antiquité dans toute sa durée
::''A l'égal de nos jours ne fut point éclairée.''
{{col-break}}
Learned [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], through all its extent, &lt;br /&gt;Was never [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened]] to equal our times.&lt;ref&gt;Perrault's poem was published in 1687 in [[François de Callières]]'s ''Histoire poetique de la guerre nouvellement declarée entre les anciens et les modernes'' ("Poetic history of the war recently declared between the ancients and the moderns"),  which was not itself strictly partisan of one side or the other..&lt;/ref&gt;
{{col-end}}

[[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]] quickly followed with his ''Digression sur les anciens et les modernes'' (1688), in which he took the Modern side, pressing the argument that modern scholarship allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge.

In the opening years of the next century, [[Marivaux]] was to show himself a Modern by establishing a new genre of theatre, unknown to the Ancients, the sentimental comedy (''[[comédie larmoyante]]''). In it the impending tragedy was resolved at the end, amid reconciliations and floods of tears. By constraining his choice of subjects to those drawn from the literature of [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], [[Jean Racine]] showed himself one of the Ancients. He also restricted his tragedies by the [[classical unities]], derived by the [[classicism|classicists]] from [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'': the unities of place, time, and action (one scene location, 24 hours, and consistent actions respectively).

==Assessment==
The Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns was a cover, often a witty one, for deeper opposed views. The very idea of Progress was under attack on the one side, and [[Authority]] on the other.  The new [[Antiquary|antiquarian interests]] led to critical reassessment of the products of Antiquity that would eventually bring Scripture itself under the magnifying glass of some Moderns.  The attack on authority in literary criticism had analogues in the rise of scientific inquiry, and the Moderns' challenge to authority in literature foreshadowed a later extension of challenging inquiry in systems of politics and religion.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Analogous 17th–20th century debates==
In the 17th century, [[William Temple (British politician)|Sir William Temple]] argued against the Modern position in his essay ''On Ancient and Modern Learning''; therein he repeated the [[literary topos|commonplace]], originally from [[Bernard of Chartres]], that we see more only because we are dwarves [[standing on the shoulders of giants]].   Temple's essay prompted a small flurry of responses. Among others, two men who took the side opposing Temple were classicist and editor [[Richard Bentley]] and critic [[William Wotton]].

The entire discussion in England was over by 1696, but it was revisited by [[Jonathan Swift]], who saw in the opposing camps of Ancients and Moderns a shorthand of two general orientations or ways of life. He articulated his discussion most notably in his [[satire]] ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]'', composed between 1694 and 1697 and published in 1704 with the famous prolegomenon ''[[The Battle of the Books]]'', long after the initial salvoes were over in France. Swift's polarizing satire provided a framework for other satirists in his circle of the [[Scriblerus Club|Scriblerian]]s.

Two other distinguished 18th-century philosophers who wrote at length concerning the distinction between moderns and ancients are [[Giambattista Vico]] (cf. e.g. his ''[[De nostri temporis studiorum ratione]]'') and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (for whom the moderns see 'more,' but the ancients see 'better').

In 19th-century England, highlighting the distinction between Hellenism ("Athens"/reason or "sweetness and light") and Hebraism ("Jerusalem"/faith), [[Matthew Arnold]] defended the ancients (most notably Plato and Aristotle) against the dominant progressive intellectual trends of his times.  Arnold drew attention to the fact that the great divide between ancients and modernists pertained to the understanding of the relation between liberty/reason and authority.

Countering the thrust of much of 20th-century intellectual history and literary criticism, [[Leo Strauss]] has contended that the debate between ancients and moderns (or the defenders of either camp) is ill understood when reduced to questions of progress or regress.  Strauss himself revived the old "querelle," siding with the ancients (against the modernist position advocated, e.g., by Strauss's friend [[Alexandre Kojève]]).{{cn|date=April 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13286">The '''Rudolf Virchow lecture''' was an annual public [[lecture]] delivered by an eminent researcher in the field of [[Palaeolithic]] [[archaeology]] in [[Neuwied]] ([[Germany]]). The lecture was held in honour of the [[Germany|German]] [[physician]], [[archaeologist]] and [[politician]] [[Rudolf Virchow]] and his contributions to German archaeology, whilst at the same time also honouring the outstanding accomplishments of the invited speaker.
The lecture series was discontinued after 2016, when a new price, THE HUMAN ROOTS AWARD was established to recognise significant achievements that have had an outstanding impact or great influence in understanding the archaeology of [[human evolution|human behavioural evolution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://web.rgzm.de/ueber-uns/presse/pressemitteilungen/pm/article/human-roots-award-an-den-evolutionsbiologen-richard-dawkins-ueberreicht/|title=Human Roots Award« an den Evolutionsbiologen Richard Dawkins überreicht|access-date=2018-03-15|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Background==
[[Laureates]] were chosen based on their contributions to the field of [[Palaeolithic archaeology]] and nomination and presentation of the price were carried out by [[Romano-Germanic Central Museum (Mainz)|Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz]], which had particularly close ties with Virchow. For many years Virchow was member of the board of directors of the museum and campaigned for its [[independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Virchow Vorlesung. Jahrbuch des Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseums 1987, Verlag des Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseums Mainz, Mainz 1989, page 725&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also Virchow, who was largely responsible for the establishment of an [[interdisciplinary]], scientific archaeology. Through his efforts, disciplines such as [[physical anthropology|anthropology]], [[zoology]], [[botany]], [[geology]] and [[chemistry]] were established as accepted means of inquiry within archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Virchow Vorlesung. Jahrbuch des Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseums 1987, Verlag des Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseums Mainz, Mainz 1989, page 725&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the liberal politician also campaigned for social equality and against [[anti-Semitism]].

The Rudolf-Virchow lecture was held at the Schlosstheater Neuwied. To make the lecture accessible to a broad spectrum of the public the lecture is held in [[German language|German]]. It was one of the most long-standing archaeological public lecture series with focus on Palaeolithic archaeology in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.rgzm.de/1507.html, accessed 2012-08-25 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Russian-Armenian University''' ('''RAU''') ({{lang-ru|Российско-Армянский университет}}, РАУ; {{lang-hy|Հայ-Ռուսական համալսարան}}) is an intergovernmental university being under the joint authority of the Russian Federation and Armenia. The university has a status of a higher educational institution in both states. The languages of instruction and communication at the university are [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]].&lt;ref&gt;http://international.rau.am/eng/discoverRAU/historyoverview&lt;/ref&gt;

There are Russian and Armenian education sectors operating at RAU. Upon graduation, students receive two state Diplomas: Armenian and Russian.

==History==
[[File:Սլավոնական համալսարան.JPG|thumb|left|The main building]]
Russian-Armenian University was established following the inter-state agreement between Armenia and Russian Federation in 1997.

In 1999, Academician Levon Mkrtchyan, Doctor of Philology, became university's first Rector.

At present RAU Rector is former Prime-Minister of Armenia, Doctor of Economics, Professor, Corresponding Member of the National Academy of Sciences of Armenia, Armen Darbinyan, who assumed the post in 2001.

The first students were enrolled in February 1999 in Law, Public and Municipal Administration and Journalism. Since then, the university has been constantly growing and encompassing new areas of education and research.

Starting from 2002, scientific centers, institutions and problem research groups have been developing within the university. In the same year RAU opened a post-graduate course.

In 2004 the reconstruction of the main building was finished, while in 2009 RAU opened its own Sports Complex.

On October 15, 2004, the Park of Gratitude was opened on the university premises as a symbol of the Russian-Armenian friendship. This very day has become the day of RAU.

On April 29, 2005 RAU was accredited by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation.[http://international.rau.am/eng/discoverRAU/historyoverview]

The '''Singapore Mathematical Olympiad''' ('''SMO''') is a mathematics competition organised by the [[Singapore Mathematical Society]]. It comprises three sections, Junior, Senior and Open, each of which is open to all pre-university students studying in Singapore who meet the age requirements for the particular section. The competition is held annually, and the first round of each section is usually held in late May or early June. The second round is usually held in late June or early July.

&lt;!--
== History ==
== Eligibility ==
== Format of the Competition ==
--&gt;

== Junior Section ==

The Junior Section consists of 5 multiple-choice questions, each with five options, and 20 open-ended questions, geared towards Lower Secondary students. Topics tested include number theory, calculus, pattern recognition, geometry, simple combinatorics and algebra. Noticeably, trigonometry is not included as a test subject, because trigonometry is not included in the Lower Secondary mathematical curriculum.
Beginning in 2006, a second round was added, based on the Senior Invitational Round, and consists of a 6-question, 3hour long essay/proof.

== Senior Section ==

There are two rounds to the Senior Section: a written round (Round 1) and an invitational round (Round 2).

The exam in Round 1 consists of 5 multiple-choice questions, each with five options, and 20 open-ended questions. The Senior Test is geared towards Upper Secondary students, and topics tested include number theory, combinatorics, geometry, algebra, probability.

The second round, the Senior Invitational Round consists of a 5-question, 4-hour long paper, with each question of varying difficulty. Only the top scorers of Round 1 are invited to take this test, and helps determine the individual rankings of the test takers.

== Open Section ==

Similar to the Senior Section, there are also two rounds, the written round (Round 1) and the invitational round (Round 2).

The paper in Round 1 comprises 25 open-ended questions, and geared towards pre-university students. Topics tested include number theory, combinatorics, geometry, algebra, probability, but of a higher difficulty level than the Senior Section.

The Open Invitational Round consists of a 5-question, 4.5-hour long paper, in which only the top scorers of Round 1 are invited to take. This test will help determine the individual rankings of the scorers, and in addition, it acts as a guideline to select Singaporean or Permanent Resident participants for the National Team training team, whereby a further six will then be selected for the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]].

== Prizes ==

As of 2006, in each of the Junior and Senior sections, prizes are awarded to the 30 individuals with the highest total scores in the first and special rounds, as well as to the 20 [[secondary schools]] with the highest team scores. The team score is computed by summing the three best scores from students of their school in the first round alone. In the Open section, prizes are similarly awarded to the top 30 individuals, as well as to the 10 institutions (secondary schools and [[junior colleges]] with the highest team scores from the first round.

Effective 2012, however, school awards are also awarded based purely on the sum of the 3 highest scorers, including both the first and second round.

The above prizes take the form of cash awards, certificates displaying the individual's/team's ranking, as well as trophies. Individuals who do not place in the top 30 may also receive gold, silver, bronze, honourable mentions or participation, in decreasing order of merit.

'''Strephosymbolia''' is a term coined in 1925 by [[Samuel Orton]] to distinguish between itself and "[[dyslexia|word-blindness]]". No reasons were given for what these distinctions arise from, or what exactly strephosymbolia means other than "a descriptive name for the whole group of children who show unusual difficulty in learning to read".&lt;ref&gt;McClelland, Jane. "Gillingham: Contemporary After 76 Years", ''Annals of Dyslexia'' '''49''' (1989): 3-49.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition was subsequently changed in 1937 to specify that, as a condition, it creates difficulty in seeing the ends of written words in unfamiliar languages, especially those in which the letters look similar to each other such as "b" and "d", "m" and "n" and "p" and "q".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1027">'''Technical informatics''' is a subclass of [[computer engineering]] that combines general [[informatics]] with technology. Particularly in the field of [[electrical engineering]], it has numerous correlations with the engineering sciences. However, the perspective of technical informatics is not marked by the technical disciplines alone but the focus is rather on giving special emphasis to typical aspects of informatics in order to find more general and universal solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-office.fh-koeln.de/english/faculties/overview/f10/courses/u/01602.php Technical Informatics (diploma) description]&lt;/ref&gt;

Torget, currently Assistant Professor of History at the [[University of North Texas]]. It aims to explore the expansion of slavery between the years 1837 and 1845 in the lands in and around what would eventually become the state of Texas. It has been listed as among "the best and most important new work" in the developing digital history medium.&lt;ref name=perspectives&gt;{{Citation

==Project Creation==

The initial creation of the [http://www.texasslaveryproject.org/ ''Texas Slavery Project''] arose from the needs of Andrew J. Torget while writing his doctoral dissertation examining the movement of American slaveholders and their slaves into Mexico during the 1820-1840s. Using the collection of tax information Torget assembled during his research, he created a database of population levels which was adapted into a digital [[MySQL]] format to allow greater control over the information contained in the database. Using the data from this new database, Torget then used [[GIS|Geospatial Information Systems]] (GIS) to visualize the spatial relations reflected in the population information which created highly complicated interactive maps.&lt;ref name=abstract&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's [http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/ ''Digital History''] website, Torget claimed that that use of these digital techniques provided for him "a microscope, of sorts, to look into the data that I already have in ways that, otherwise, I couldn't have done."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Torget |first=Andrew J. |title=Andrew Torget, University of Virginia |format=Interview |publisher=''Digital History'' |location=Lincoln, NE |year=2007 |url=http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/interviews.php#torget |accessdate=October 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421202516/http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/interviews.php |archivedate=April 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their examination of "exemplar" digital history projects in the May 2009 issue of the [[American Historical Society]]'s ''Perspectives on History'', historians Douglas Seefeldt and William G. Thomas heralded the ''Texas Slavery Project'' for its display of "how a digital project might extend, deepen, and launch interpretive aspects of a dissertation."&lt;ref name=perspectives/&gt;

==Project Overview==

According to the project's founder and director, Andrew J. Torget, the ''Texas Slavery Project'' endeavors to use digital technologies such as the MySQL database system and GIS mapping tools in order to analyze the spread of American slavery into the borderlands between Mexico and the United States. Through the use of digital maps, a database of historical population levels, and digitized primary source documents, the project examines the role of slavery in the development of the [[American Southwest]].&lt;ref name=abstract/&gt;

==Project Contents==

===Maps===

The maps contained within the project are, in fact, one decidedly interactive map for the years 1837-1845 which displays slave and slaveholder population statistics of the counties of Texas as well as various layers of data such as U.S. borders, regional rivers, a moveable timeline, and graphs displaying the rate of change in the population data. The information on the map can also be animated to see how the trends change over time. An additional feature graphs the information contained on the map and allows users to control the contents of the graph.  The map and graph are in turn linked directly to the information in the database. For example, clicking on the outline of Nacogdoches County with the timeline demarking 1838 reveals the population information pertinent to Nacogdoches in 1838. This information is also provided by clicking on the point of the Nacogdoches county graph indicating 1838. "As a research and education tool this has the capacity to quickly show historical patterns and correlations that would otherwise have been extremely difficult to identify and illustrate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | issn = 1833-4946 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Database===

The project contains a searchable database of the population information compiled from Texas tax records.  It is searchable by County or County Criteria, both of which allow the user to filter the search results as he or she chooses. The database contains information regarding the total slave population, total master population, masters with 1-4 slaves, masters with 5-9 slaves, masters with 10-19 slaves, masters with 20-49 slaves, masters with 50+ slaves, and the average slaveholding. The search results are downloadable in a text format. There are also a variety of graphs and statistics from data in the population database.

===Primary sources===

The project contains digitized copies of primary source documents from the 1820s through the 1840s.  The documents are organized by the type of document: ''The Laws of Texas'', the Diplomatic Correspondence of the Republic of Texas, the James F. Perry Papers, the ''[[Telegraph &amp; Texas Register]]'' of Houston, and the ''Civilian &amp; Galveston Gazette''. The user has the option of browsing the documents or using the search engine.

==History==
The American University of Iraq, Sulaimani was founded in 2006 by a Board of Trustees who set out to establish an institution dedicated to offering a comprehensive, American-style education in Iraq.&lt;ref name="AMI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EKU"/&gt; The University, modeled after the famous private universities in Cairo and Beirut, was created amid the turmoils of war but in the relatively secure Kurdish region of Iraq. The purpose of founding such a university, according to Dr. [[Barham Salih]] was to stimulate reform in the Iraqi education system. Its location, however, was contested by Arab education officials in Baghdad who argued that the university should be built there and not in a region with historically secessionist ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Wong, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/world/middleeast/03university.html "An American University for Iraq but Not in Baghdad."]  The New York Times, January 3, 2007. Accessed 4 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectuals such as [[Kanan Makiya]], [[Fouad Ajami]] and [[John Agresto]], many of whom supported the 2003 American invasion, supported the establishment of AUIS. John Agresto went on to become the University’s Acting Chancellor for a brief interregnum, after serving as a Coalition Provisional Authority Senior Advisor to the [[Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (Iraq)|Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research]] in Baghdad. Joshua Mitchell, professor of political theory at [[Georgetown University]] became Acting Chancellor in 2008 and remained in his position for two years while on leave from Georgetown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/mitchelj/ Joshua Mitchell], Georgetown University, People. Accessed 4 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2010 to 2013, [[Athanasios Moulakis]] served as Acting President and he continues to hold the title of President Emeritus of the University. In May 2013, the Board of Trustees chose [[Dawn Dekle]] as president. She became the first female president of an Iraqi university when she took up her position at AUIS. She ended her tenure at AUIS in November 2014 due to family circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;AUIS. [http://auis.edu.krd/node/1470 Dr. Dawn Dekle Ends Her Tenure as President of AUIS.] Accessed 4 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Esther Mulnix was chosen to serve as interim president after Dekle’s departure.&lt;ref&gt;AUIS, [http://auis.edu.krd/mulnix_bio Dr. Esther Mulnix.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905110920/http://auis.edu.krd/mulnix_bio |date=2015-09-05 }} Accessed 4 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==

The main campus has 169-hectares of land situated on the Sulaimani-Kirkuk Road, close to the [[University of Sulaymaniyah]].

===Sulaimani Forum===

The Institute of Regional and International Studies (IRIS) at AUIS organises an annual forum to open dialogue and debate on the challenging regional political issues concerning the Middle East. The Sulaimani Forum is held in March/April every year and focuses on the most pressing local and regional issues through in-depth panel discussions and debates.&lt;ref name="sulaimaniforum.com"&gt;[http://sulaimaniforum.com/sulaimaniforum2015/ Sulaimani Forum.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516051841/http://sulaimaniforum.com/sulaimaniforum2015/ |date=2015-05-16 }} Accessed 5 Feb 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The forum invites prominent speakers and specialists on the topic from both within Iraq, the wider region and Europe and the United States. The forum is covered extensively by the local and international media. During the inaugural Forum in 2013, the event trended on Twitter with #SulaimaniForum in Egypt and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cloud.snappages.com/db139e142aed7611bb5b31ed4679c1592eba4e82/Sulaimani%20Forum%202013.pdf "The Inaugural Sulaimani Forum"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205100015/http://cloud.snappages.com/db139e142aed7611bb5b31ed4679c1592eba4e82/Sulaimani%20Forum%202013.pdf |date=2015-02-05 }}.

The first Sulaimani Forum, in March 2013 held at AUIS, explored the changing dynamics of the Middle East. The forum created a very open debate on issues such as Iraq’s internal and external relations, oil, security,  Kurdistan and the Arab Spring, etc. The speakers and panelists included distinguished names such as [[Hoshyar Zebari]], [[Zalmay Khalilzad]], and [[Max Rodenbeck]] among others. “For an Iraqi Kurd and someone who has attended many such events around the world, the Sulaimani Forum provided the most relevant discussions on Iraq, its politics and future” reviewed Kurdish journalist and commentator [[Hiwa Osman]] on his blog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hiwaosman.com/2013/03/in-the-back-rows-of-the-sulaimani-forum-a-hint-of-iraqs-future/ "Thoughts from Iraq: A page that completes the Iraqi story".] Accessed 5 Feb 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 2009, ''[[CounterPunch]]'' ran an article by former English instructor Mark Grueter who stated that the university functioned more as a political tool than as an educational institution.&lt;ref&gt;Grueter, Mark, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/11/06/inside-the-american-university-of-iraq/ Inside the American University of Iraq], ''[[CounterPunch]]'' (November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  Faculty members and students have complained about mismanagement and incompetence.&lt;ref name=Salon /&gt;

In 2010, ''[[AlterNet]]'' ran an article by former English instructor John Dolan which affirmed Grueter's viewpoint and detailed the university's connections to [[Donald Rumsfeld]] via [[John Agresto]].&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, John, [http://www.alternet.org/story/148443/i_was_a_professor_at_the_horribly_corrupt_american_university_of_iraq..._until_the_neocons_fired_me I Was a Professor at the Horribly Corrupt [American University of Iraq]...

'''TrendTopper MediaBuzz College Guide''' is an American-college guide based on what it calls "Internet brand equity" based on Internet data, social media, blogs and the top 75,000 print and electronic media outlets.  It ranks what it calls the Top 300 United States colleges and universities.  The guide includes specialty and for profit schools including Art, Business, Design, Music, and Online Education.  The TrendTopper MediaBuzz College Rankings are produced twice a year by the [[Global Language Monitor]] of [[Austin]], [[Texas]].

== College brand equity==
The TrendTopper MediaBuzz College Rankings are produced twice a year by the [[Global Language Monitor]].  GLM describes their rankings as measuring the Internet “Brand Equity” of the colleges and universities.  [[Time Magazine]] described internet brand equity as "a measure of who's talking about you online, based on Internet data, social media, blogs and the top 75,000 print and electronic media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/01/05/the-most-buzzed-about-university-wisconsin/ The Most Buzzed-About University?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/30/us-universities-topbrands-idUSTRE6BT41J20101230/ Harvard, Yale Beaten]&lt;/ref&gt; 
GLM ranks the schools "according to their online presence -- or internet brand equity ... By focusing on online presence, the Monitor hopes to avoid the biases that characterize other rankings, which commonly rely on the opinions of university officials and college counselors rather than that of the greater public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/10/buzzworthy-schools-which-_n_806809.html#s221586&amp;title=University_of_WisconsinMadison/ The Most Buzz Worthy Schools]&lt;/ref&gt;" GLM believes the rankings provide an up-to-date perspective on which schools have the most popular brand. 
for example, it cites the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania (ranked fifth in 2010 by U.S. News) fared almost equivalently to Penn State (ranked 47th in 2010 by U.S. News), ranking 22nd and 24th respectively." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/10/buzzworthy-schools-which-_n_806809.html#s221586&amp;title=University_of_WisconsinMadison/ Buzzworthy Schools]&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting tool, the group claims, gauges the relative value of the various institutions and how they change over time.

== Inclusion of specialty schools==
The rankings are the only ones that contain specialty schools which are typically assigned to "unranked" or "other' categories. "The rankings include specialty (and for profit) schools as well, such as Art, Business, Design,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pratt.edu/admissions/request_information/facts_and_figures/ Pratt Rankings&lt;/ref&gt; Music, and even Online Education.  Most specialty schools are included in the College category with the exception of the online university, which is assigned to the University category ... 
The MediaBuzz list also compiles the Best of Class (BOC) from among all, the designation being awarded to those schools that are first in terms of brand repute and impact, either in the overall ranking or in a specific classification, such as Top Catholic College&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.HolyCross.edu/ Holy Cross]&lt;/ref&gt; or University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgetown.edu./ Georgetown]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/96516/20101231/harvard-chicago-university-rankings-brand.htm Wisconsin Beats Harvard in Brand Equity]&lt;/ref&gt;"

The TrendTopper MediaBuzz Analysis uses the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]]’s classifications as the basis to distinguish between Universities and Liberal Arts Colleges. The schools were ranked in the last week of December with a mid-year snapshot, and the last day of 2009 as the base.

GLM claims that TrendTopper MediaBuzz utilizes a mathematical model that ‘normalizes’ the data collected from the Internet, social media, and blogosphere as well as the top 75,000 print and electronic media and that the end result is a non-biased analytical tool that provides a gauge of relative values among various institutions, as well as measures of how that value changes over time.  The basics of the methodology are available for download directly from the Global Language Monitor site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.languagemonitor.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
TrendTopper MediaBuzz uses narrative tracking technology, where the words, phrases and concepts are tracked in relation to their frequency, contextual usage and appearance in global media outlets.  This exclusive ranking is based upon GLM's Narrative Tracking technology.  NarrativeTracker analyzes the Internet, blogosphere, the 75,000 print and electronic media, as well as new social media sources (such as Twitter).  NarrativeTracker replaced the controversial PQI index, which had been criticized by a number of linguists, but no media tracking, or computer scientists or other members of the academic community, for its use in the counting of the number of English words.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyID=5390581 Enumerating English],&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Language Monitor also sells the TrendTopper MediaBuzz Reputation Management solution for higher education for which "colleges and universities can enhance their standings among peers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/about/trendtopper/trendtopper-enhances-college-reputation | title=TrendTopper enhances college reputation | publisher=Global Language Monitor | accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Global Language Monitor states that it "does not influence the Higher Education rankings in any way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/college_rankings |title=College Rankings |publisher=[[The Global Language Monitor]] }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons to other rankings==
Milwaukee Magazine stated that "a study by Kiplinger’s that buttresses Global Language Monitor’s findings, researchers conclude that UW-Madison is one of the best values in higher education.  The study ranked schools based on academic caliber – graduation and retention rates, student-to-teacher ratios and the SAT and ACT scores of incoming students – and affordability".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milwaukeenewsbuzz.com/?p=412645 Brand power]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparisons are frequently made between the TrendTopper MediaBuzz College rankings and the ''[[Princeton Review]]'' and the [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] College and University rankings, which suggest that "a brand equity service based on ''buzz'' is certainly important, and reflects a more democratic perspective. It is a good contender against rankings posted by U.S. News &amp; World Report or The Princeton Review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thefosburyflop.com/2011/01/07/edu-brand-equity/ Ed-BrandEquity]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are others who question the value of using brand equity studies with higher education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/agencyspy/university-of-wisconsin-1-in-internet-brand-equity_b12361 Wisconsin No. 1 in Internet Brand Equity]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Jacques attended [[St Joseph's College, Ipswich|St. Joseph's College]], Birkfield, Ipswich, a school run by the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|De La Salle brothers]], from 1967 to 1974. He earned his degree in [[Physics]] from the [[Imperial College London|Imperial College of Science and Technology]] in 1978, thereby becoming an associate of the [[Royal College of Science]] (A.R.C.S.) and graduate the [[Institute of Physics]] (GradInstP.). From 1979, he worked for Seismograph Service Ltd. as a field seismologist off the coast of the [[French Congo]] and [[Gabon]] and in [[England]], for two and a half years, before designing the acceptance test specifications and procedure for the missile management system of a European aircraft for Computing Devices Company, in [[Hastings]], [[East Sussex]]. In 1981, he emigrated to Toronto to work at [[Spar Aerospace]] for nine years on an infrared surveillance system for the Canadian and U.S. navies. Subsequently, he moved to SmartStar and Orapro (database companies) in Toronto, as head of technical support and then director of consulting. He was CIO at [[Stott Pilates]] (now Merrithew Health and Fitness) for three years (1998-2001), and continues to provide IT consulting to the company.

===Later===
He co-founded Toronto’s Safer SM Education seminar series in 1991, along with co-authors of ''On The Safe Edge'', Dr. Dale McCarthy (1937-2007, co-founder of the AIDS Committee of Toronto (ACT)), Michael Hamilton, and Sniffer (the latter being a dentist and teacher at the [[University of Toronto]]), and both organised and presented the seminars for thirteen years (1991-2004). The seminars led to both the publication of ''On The Safe Edge'' and updated versions of ''Safer SM'' (a BDSM safer sex pamphlet published by the AIDS Committee of Toronto).&lt;ref name="SSM21"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://SexResearch.ca/SSSS/PDFs/SaferSM5-PanelPamphlet19951115.pdf |title=Safer SM, 1995 |publisher=The AIDS Committee of Toronto |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSM22"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sexresearch.ca/SSSS/PDFs/SaferSM6-PanelPamphlet19991011.pdf |title=Safer SM, 1999 |publisher=The AIDS Committee of Toronto |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BDSMSKSE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orders.catie.ca/product_info.php?products_id=25523 |title=BDSM: Safer Kinky Sex, 1996, 2009, 2010 |publisher=The AIDS Committee of Toronto |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BDSMSKSF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orders.catie.ca/product_info.php?products_id=25838 |title=BDSM: Jeux 'kinky' plus sécuritaires, 2011 |publisher=The AIDS Committee of Toronto |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacques|first=Trevor|title=Mr. Leatherman Toronto Souvenir Guide|year=2001|edition=2001|author2=Adkin, David |author3=Gowans, Doug |publisher=Mr. Leatherman Toronto Competition, Inc.|location=Toronto|isbn=|issn=1499-5417|pages=56|url=http://TorontoLeatherPride.ca/|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2002,&lt;ref name="MrLT2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacques|first=Trevor|title=Mr. Leatherman Toronto Souvenir Guide|year=2002|edition=2002|author2=Adkin, David |publisher=Mr. Leatherman Toronto Competition, Inc.|location=Toronto|isbn=|issn=1499-5417|pages=64|url=http://TorontoLeatherPride.ca/data/forms/MrLTSouvenirGuide2003.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he edited and published the souvenir guide for the Mr. Leatherman Toronto Competition.

Jacques has contributed articles, interviews, and expert advice to dozens of magazines, newspapers, and radio and television stations in North America and Europe.

Jacques served as an expert witness in the 1998 "[[Terri-Jean Bedford|Bondage Bungalow]]" case in north Toronto. ''On The Safe Edge'' was cited in the submissions by the BDSM community in London, England to the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] as it prepared its report "Consent in the Criminal Law" (consultation paper 139), as a result of the [[Operation Spanner|Spanner case]].

In 2009, Jacques was featured in the fourth Canadian edition of the sexuality textbook ''Understanding Human Sexuality''.&lt;ref name="Understanding Human Sexuality"&gt;[http://www.mcgrawhill.ca/highereducation/products/0070764107/ ''Understanding Human Sexuality''], In Focus 15.2, pp. 476-477. {{ISBN|9780070764101}}, {{ISBN|0070764107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques’s most recent publication is ''BDSM: Safer Kinky Sex'', in both English and French, for the AIDS Committee of Toronto. It is the third major revision of a safer sex education pamphlet created and edited by the Toronto BDSM community, this time large enough to take the form of a booklet. He also edited the two variants of the previous version (see References). Jacques was invited by ACT to launch the French version in Montréal, in May, 2011.

The '''Washington Conservation Guild''' (WCG) is a non-profit organization of conservation professionals.  The WCG serves as a resource for learning about the care of art collections.

== History ==
The Washington Conservation Guild (WCG) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization established in 1967 for professional conservators, students, and others interested in the preservation of art and historic materials.

The idea for the regional conservation group was proposed as early as 1965, when the International Council of Museums (ICOM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icom.museum/|title=ICOM - The International Council of Museums- ICOM|work=icom.museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Committee for Conservation met in Washington, DC.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Washington Conservation Guild |title=Newsletter|date=September 2007|volume=31|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first steering committee met informally in the summer of 1967; here, it was decided that the primary intentions of the group was to provide a public forum where members could meet and "sponsor presentations to promote the exchange of ideas among conservators in all fields in the Washington area."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Bylaws/Code of Ethics for Members ==
Bylaws or Code of Ethics put forward by the WCG to define its governance and for its members as a condition of membership.

== Organization &amp; Governance ==

Based in [[Washington, D.C.]], the WCG draws its members primarily from Washington, Maryland, and northern Virginia.  Members include both professional conservators and non-conservators - from government, state, and private museums; as well as studios, laboratories, and other cultural or academic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington Conservation Guild|url=http://www.conservators-converse.org/2011/06/washington-conservation-guild/|accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are no restrictions on who may apply for membership.

The Washington Conservation Guild is governed by all-volunteered, membership-elected Board of Directors.  The Board is composed of five officers and several directors.  The WCG is also composed of several committees, led by Board-appointed chairs.

Elections for WCG Board Officers and Directors take place May at the Annual Business Meeting.

== Projects ==

===Events===

The WCG holds meetings from October through May each year, generally on the first Thursday of each month.  Once annually, the Guild hosts the 3-Ring Circus event. The '3-Ring Circus' held January 9, 2014 in partnership with the National Museum of African Art, ran with three consecutive sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington Conservation Guild - 3 Ring Circus|url=https://www.iiconservation.org/node/4466|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The themes for the January 2014 3-Ring Circus were "Conservation in Far Flung Places;" "Analytical;" and "Contemporary."

The Guild also holds several monthly events over the course of the year.  These events have included lectures, workshops, and networking sessions.

===Angels Project===

The Angels Project is designed to "promote a broader understanding of the importance of cultural preservation while providing meaningful assistance to important local collections."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angels |url=http://www.conservation-us.org/annual-meeting/angels-project|accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members participating in the Projects work pro-bono, volunteering their time and conservation expertise at a particular historic site.  The Angels Project originally began in 1988 with the WCG's parent group, the American Institute of Conservation, pairing conservators with collections that need care.

===Fire at the Georgetown Public Library===

On April 30, 2007, a three-alarm fire caused significant damage to the Georgetown branch of the DC Public Library.  City officials estimated the cost to repair the library at about $20 million; the renovation included the restoration of exterior doors and windows, stone masonry, and ornamental railings and grates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Klein|first=Allison|title=Investigators Pin the Blame On Paint-Removing Heat Gun|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=May 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the WCG responded and coordinated with the DC library officials to set up disaster recovery efforts.  At its annual meeting days later on May 3, 2007, the WCG held a fundraiser raffle.  The proceeds went to support the conservation of the library's artwork, manuscripts, maps, and documents damaged in the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Washington Conservation Guild holds fundraiser for Georgetown Public Library|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/files/2007/05/0502gtown.pdf|format=PDF|work=Washington Conservation Guild|date=May 2, 2007|accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==

The Washington Conservation Guild published a quarterly newsletter written and edited by volunteers to benefit guild members.  Offered at first only as a printed edition, the newsletter transitioned to an online PDF.  The newsletter was published as a PDF until December 2012, when it was replaced by a continuously-updated blog-style website.  Archived newsletters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtonconservationguild.org/newsletter-archive/|title=Newsletter archive|work=Washington Conservation Guild}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be found on the WCG website.

In 2004, the Washington Conservation Guild published the second edition of its eBook, ''Conservation Resources for Art and Antiques''.  ''Conservation Resources'' is a guide describing how to care for and preserve fine art, antiques, family heirlooms, memorabilia, and personal collections.

The '''Washington-Ireland Program''' for Service and Leadership ('''WIP''') is a six-month program of personal and [[professional development]] that brings  [[university]] students from [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] to [[Washington, DC]] for summer internships and leadership training. The program begins and ends with practical service (usually some form of voluntary work in the [[NGO]] or political sectors) in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It was originally called The Young Leaders Program.

In Washington, participants get first-hand experience with [[U.S. government]] and politics and an immersion in American culture by living with an area host family. Through an eight-week schedule, participants are encouraged to work and learn as a team and to create an environment of mutual respect. The program aims to send students home with enhanced professional and interpersonal skills and a new confidence in their own leadership abilities which they are expected to demonstrate through service to their own communities. Among the 2007 [[Internship]] opportunities were placements in the Senate offices of then [[United States Senator|Senators]] [[Barack Obama]] and [[Hillary Clinton]].

Current [[Taoiseach]] [[Leo Varadkar]] was a member of the Class of 2000.

==About the Program==
Since its inception in 1995, the program has expanded from four to eight weeks, allowing time for both leadership training and work experience. Students are placed in offices across the Washington metropolitan region representing federal and local government, businesses, non-profit organizations, professional services firms and media organizations. Placements have included [[The White House]], Congressional offices, The Northern Ireland Bureau, The [[World Bank]], [[Habitat for Humanity]], [[AFL-CIO]], [[CNN]] and [[CBS]], Library of Congress, Environmental Protection Agency, National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, The Justice Project, Imagination Stage and Solas Nua, among many others.

Participants develop practical leadership abilities by committing to 30 hours of service in their own communities before the summer and 40 hours in a Group Service Project when they return. Students also help launch and run the following year's program by assisting with marketing, recruiting, selecting and mentoring the succeeding WIP class.

Successful candidates must be Irish-born, or Irish or British (NI) citizens with current passports. They must be full-time students in Ireland or the [[United Kingdom]], between the ages of 18 and 25, and passing their subjects at a better than passing grade.  Moreover, they must be willing to demonstrate leadership through service before and after the program, and be ready to participate in diverse leadership teams. Program applicants have represented more than 30 different universities in Northern Ireland, Ireland, England and Scotland.

To date, 300 young adults have graduated from the program. Many WIP graduates have moved into important careers in politics, business, media and education. These include: a research officer to the NI First Minister in Westminster; television and radio news journalists; reporters for major newspapers in Belfast and London; barristers and solicitors; university professors and primary school teachers; consultants with Accenture and PriceWaterhouseCoopers; Dublin PR firm managers; assistant to Members of the NI Assembly and the Irish Parliament; political party operatives in Northern Ireland and the Republic; and Executive Officer for the Home Office in London. Among the notable alumni is [[Taoiseach]] [[Leo Varadkar]].

Initially begun in partnership with the Students' Union at Queen's University, Belfast, WIP has received support from the Irish Government through its Department of Education and the International Fund for Ireland as well as the UK government and the US State Department. The program is now actively developing partnerships with other government departments, universities, businesses, foundations and individuals that will support its core program and help expand alumni programs.

The Washington-Ireland Program is an extension of Project Children, a program that sponsors six-week summer holidays in the U.S. for young people from Northern Ireland. The participants, who stay with American Host Families, range in age from 10–14 years old and come from neighborhoods in which the Protestant-Catholic conflict has taken an especially heavy toll. For most children, these visits provide a first-time opportunity to get to know people from the other side of the sectarian divide. In its 27-year existence, Project Children has had 17,000 participants. Project Children also works with vocational trainees from Northern Ireland and the Republic who get on-site work experience in the U.S. by building homes with Habitat for Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Article originally by Simon Lloyd-Lavery, 2006 team member.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, alumni members of the Washington-Ireland Programme established a charity known as the [[Youth Empowerment Scheme]], a mentoring programme for children aged 11–14 years old from across Belfast. The aim of YES is to promote social inclusion of children from different ethnic, religious, educational and socio-economic backgrounds.

==Notable alumni==
* [[Leo Varadkar]] (Class of 2000), Fine Gael TD for [[Dublin West (Dáil constituency)|Dublin West]] and [[Taoiseach]] (Head of Government) of Ireland since 14 June 2017.

'''''Water Park Tycoon''''' is a sandbox [[video game]] where the player's goal is to create a successful water park. It was developed and published by [[Excalibur Publishing]] Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/water-park-tycoon|title=Water Park Tycoon|website=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/water-park-tycoon/|title=Water Park Tycoon|website=GameSpot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==

[[File:Water Park Tycoon Gameplay.png|left|thumb|350px|A screenshot of the gameplay of Water Park Tycoon, showing many of the core game features.]]
The goal of the game is to build a successful [[water park]]. When a world is launched, there is a large fenced-in space where the player can build their water park, as well as a ticket booth. The park is closed when by default, but the player can open it at anytime, which will cause guests to be able to enter the park. Several types of [[Swimming pool|pools]], [[water slides]], playground rides, food stalls, and [[vegetation]] are available for the player to improve the park. When any of these are bought, the player will lose money. Money is gained when guests buy food or drink, or purchase a park ticket. The player can set the price of both of these, but if the price is too high, guests will not want to purchase an article or ticket, and the park rating will drop.

The park rating is represented by a star with a number in it as well as a percentage on the top right of the screen. The percentage and number start off at 0, but as the water park is expanded and improved, the percentage will go up, causing the number to come up too. Once the percentage gets to 90%, the number will be up to 5, which is the highest it can go. In addition to building attractions and stalls, the player can also hire [[staff of office|staff]]. These staff will perform tasks such as cleaning up the park, improving safety, and watering plants. Staff help improve the park greatly, and will therefore increase the park rating. However, the more staff you hire, the more money you lose at the end of an in-game month.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2992">The '''Winter Pool''' or '''inter-College Pool''' is an important part of the undergraduate application process for [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in [[England]], intended to ensure that the best applicants are offered places if they are not selected by the college to which they applied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/publications/docs/winterpool.pdf Guide to the Winter Pool]&lt;/ref&gt; Just under 20% of undergraduate places are awarded through the Pool.

==Criteria==
Any strong applicant who cannot be offered a place by their first choice college will be placed in the Pool and other colleges will be recommended to consider them. All applicants, except those for Mathematics and Medicine, who meet a minimum academic standard of an average of 93% or more across their three best subjects at [[Advanced Level in the United Kingdom#Curriculum_2000|AS level]] will be automatically pooled even if they did not perform well at interview.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/admissions/handbook/appendices/winterpoolofficers.pdf Undergraduate Admissions WINTER POOL 2011/2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Applicants in the Pool are graded according to four criteria:

:'''A''' — strongly recommended
:'''B''' — looked weaker on paper but impressed at interview
:'''P''' — very good on paper but less impressive at interview (this is the default for automatically pooled applicants)
:'''S''' — in special need of reassessment

The Pool takes place over two days in early January. Pooled applicants who are "fished" by a college may be offered a place immediately or they may be invited for interview.

==Statistics==
Each year about 3,000 applicants receive offers from their preference college and a further 600 to 700 applicants are made an offer by another college through the Pool. On average one in five applicants is pooled and around one in four pooled applicants receives an offer of a place.

Statistics released by the University show that some of the more popular and oversubscribed colleges such as [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]], [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]], [[King's College, Cambridge |King's College]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] rarely take applicants from the Pool while others such as [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton College]], [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge |Murray Edwards College]] (New Hall) and [[Newnham College, Cambridge |Newnham College]] draw a substantial proportion of their undergraduate intake from the Pool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/statistics/colleges.html College applications and admissions statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; The Pool thus provides a means of transferring strong applicants from oversubscribed colleges to undersubscribed ones.

==History==
[[File:Pushkinbuild1.JPG|thumb|The old building on Pushkin Street]]
Yerevan Brusov State University of Languages and Social Sciences is the successor of the ''Russian Language Teachers' Institute'' founded as a 2-year intermediate college on February 4, 1935, by the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Armenia.

In 1936, the section of the German language was opened, followed by the sections of French and English languages in 1937. During the same year, the institute produced its first graduates of teachers of the Russian language. In 1940, the institute became known as the ''Yerevan State Russian Language Teachers' Institute''. In 1955, the institute was given the status of a faculty within the [[Yerevan State University]], simultaneously preserving its structural and academic independence.

However in 1962, it was granted independence to become known as the ''Yerevan State Pedagogical University of Russian and Foreign Languages named after Valery Brusov''. In 1985, the university was awarded with the ''Order of Friendship of Nations'' by the Soviet government.

After the independence of Armenia, the university was restructured in 1993 to become known as the ''Yerevan State Institute of Foreign Languages named after Valery Brusov''.

In 2001, In compliance with the government resolution, the institute was granted the status of university and renamed as the ''Yerevan Brusov State Linguistic University''. In 2014, the university was restructured to become known as the ''Yerevan Brusov State University of Languages and Social Sciences''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1in.am/1271352.html?setoption=desktop&amp;lang=arm Բրյուսովի համալսարանը կդառնա «լեզվահասարակագիտական համալսարան»]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its history, the university has produced more than 18,000 graduates of Russian, English, French, German, Greek, Spanish languages, practical psychology, history, political science and area studies. The process of structural changes is still continuing and in the near future they will provide an opportunity to train professionals who meet the new demands of the republic.
