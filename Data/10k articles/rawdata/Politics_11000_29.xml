The Association of African Air Forces (AAAF) is a voluntary and non-political organization; membership is open to Air Forces or their equivalent within the continent of Africa and the United States of America. The Association is operated with support from the [[United States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa]] (USAFE-AFAFRICA); a [[United States Air Force]] major command (MAJCOM) and a component command of both [[United States European Command]] (USEUCOM) and [[United States Africa Command]] (USAFRICOM).&lt;ref name="usafemil2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usafe.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=20493|title=Factsheets : Fact Sheet: Usafe-Afafrica|date=|publisher=Usafe.af.mil|accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

AAAF exists as a collaborative, decision-making organization to promote African-led air power initiatives that address trans-national threats, and efficient use of air resources to improve air operations across Africa.  During the 5th annual African Air Chief Symposium, AAAF proceedings established that all signatory members "have an equal voice within the association, and will be recognized as the air forces or the equivalent service of every other signing country." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usafe.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/748094/making-history-forming-the-association-of-african-air-forces/|title=Making history: forming the Association of African Air Forces|last=Best|first=Chrissy|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39228">The '''Attorney General of Virginia's climate science investigation''' was a "Civil Investigative Demand" initiated in April 2010 by [[Attorney General of Virginia|Virginia Attorney General]] [[Ken Cuccinelli]] for a wide range of records held by the [[University of Virginia]] related to five grant applications for research work by a leading climate scientist [[Michael E. Mann]], who was an assistant professor at the university from 1999 to 2005. The demand was issued under the Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act in connection with claims by Cuccinnelli that Mann had possibly violated state fraud laws in relation to five research grants, by allegedly manipulating data. No evidence of wrongdoing was presented to support the claim. Mann's earlier work had been targeted by climate change skeptics in the [[hockey stick controversy]], and allegations against him were renewed in late 2009 in the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]] but found to be groundless in a series of investigations.&lt;ref&gt;"no evidence of wrongdoing was given to explain invoking the law, which is intended to prosecute individuals who make false claims in order to access government funds." - ''Nature'' editorial, 13 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NatureEd2010-05-13" /&gt;

Widespread concerns were raised by University of Virginia's faculty and numerous scientists and science organizations that Cuccinelli's actions posed a threat to [[academic freedom]], and would have a chilling effect on research in the state. The university filed a court petition and the judge dismissed Cuccinelli's demand on the grounds that no justification had been shown for the investigation.&lt;ref name="ucsusa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/judge-dismisses-ken-cuccinelli-mann-0437.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902015145/http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/judge-dismisses-ken-cuccinelli-mann-0437.html |archivedate=September 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cuccinelli tried to re-open his case by issuing a revised subpoena,&lt;ref name="cavalier"&gt;''The Cavalier Daily'', October 6, 2010, [http://www.cavalierdaily.com/2010/10/06/cuccinelli-orders-new-investigation/ Cuccinelli orders new investigation]&lt;/ref&gt; and appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court. The case was defended by the university, and the court ruled that Cuccinelli did not have the authority to make these demands. The outcome was hailed as a victory for academic freedom.&lt;ref name="Wapo 020312"&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Kumar | first = Anita | title = Va.

==Background==
While an adjunct assistant professor at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], [[Michael E. Mann]] co-authored with [[Raymond S. Bradley]] and [[Malcolm K. Hughes]] two reconstructions of the [[Temperature record of the past 1000 years|past temperatures in the northern hemisphere]]: MBH98 and MBH99. The latter extended back 1,000 years and was nicknamed the "[[hockey stick graph]]". In 1999 Mann joined the [[University of Virginia]] as an assistant professor. A version of MBH99 featured prominently in the 2001 [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]], and attacks on the graph by those opposing action on global warming became politically prominent in the [[Hockey stick controversy]]. The validity of the research was confirmed by the [[National Academy of Sciences]]. In 2005 Mann moved on to a position as an associate professor at [[Pennsylvania State University]]. The [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]] which began in November 2009 brought renewed scrutiny, and allegations of scientific malpractice. An investigation by Pennsylvania State University determined on 3 February 2010 that there was no evidence of misconduct by Mann.&lt;ref name="NatureEd2010-05-13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mann CV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meteo.psu.edu/~mann/Mann/cv/cv.html |title=Curriculum Vitae for Michael E. Mann |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |accessdate=2010-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629143028/http://www.meteo.psu.edu/~mann/Mann/cv/cv.html |archivedate=June 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, [[Ken Cuccinelli]] took office as Virginia's elected Attorney General. He is a conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] politician and [[global warming denier]],&lt;ref name="ODell2010-07-20" /&gt; who alleges that the evidence of global warming has been skewed by scientists.&lt;ref name="Helderman2010-05-04" /&gt; The following month he filed suit seeking to overturn a finding of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] that [[greenhouse gas]]es endanger public health.&lt;ref name="Cuccinelli2010-02-17" /&gt;

==Cuccinelli's "Civil Investigative Demand"==

Cuccinelli's office served a formal "Civil Investigative Demand" (CID) on the [[University of Virginia]] on 23 April 2010, requiring the university to produce information and documentary materials by 27 May 2010.&lt;ref name="CID 2604"&gt;Office of the Attorney General of Virginia, [http://www.readthehook.com/files/old/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/climategate-2010-04-23-civilinvestigativedemand.pdf Civil Investigative Demand CID No. 2-MM], issued 23 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The civil investigative demand was equivalent to a [[subpoena]] but did not require the Attorney General to file a lawsuit or to obtain the intervention or permission of a court so that he could make the demand.&lt;ref name="Helderman2010-05-04" /&gt;

The CID referred to an investigation by the Attorney General into "possible violations" by Mann of the Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act (FATA). Information required related to Mann having sought grants funded by the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]], and any data or communications Mann had made in connection with five named grants for scientific research. The university was instructed to produce documents dating from January 1999 to the present, including all emailed or written correspondence from, to or relating to Mann and 39 named climate scientists as well as research assistants, secretaries and administrative staff, anything connected with applications for the grants or payment of the grants, and all "documents, drafts, things or data" generated in carrying out the grant assisted research. They also required all "computer algorithms, programs, source code or the like" created or edited by Mann and stored by the university. Where documents were no longer held by the university, the CID required details of who had destroyed or removed them, and their authority for doing so.&lt;ref name="CID 2604" /&gt;

On 29 April ''[[The Hook (newspaper)|The Hook]]'' reported these demands, and the immediate response of the university that they would meet their legal obligation, but this would take time due to the range of documents required:
&lt;ref name="Hook 2904"&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Stuart | first = Courteney | title = Oh, Mann: Cuccinelli targets UVA papers in Climategate salvo | url = http://www.readthehook.com/67811/oh-mann-cuccinelli-targets-uva-papers-climategate-salvo | publisher = ''[[The Hook (newspaper)|The Hook]]'' - Charlottesville's weekly newspaper, news magazine | date = 29 April 2010 | accessdate = 15 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "the university has a legal obligation to answer this request and it is our intention to respond to the extent required by law."&lt;ref name="Helderman2010-05-04" /&gt;
Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for Cuccinelli, initially said "The attorney general's office can neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of a pending investigation".&lt;ref name="usatoday 0305"&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Vergano | first = Dan | title = Science group: Climate science 'witch hunt' underway in Virginia | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2010/04/climate-science-witch-hunt-reprised-in-virginia-/1#.T1-1h2CvLZs | publisher = ''[[USA Today]]'' | date = 3 May 2010 | accessdate = 15 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker2010-05-04" /&gt;

On 4 May the ''[[Washington Post]]'' published Cuccinelli's comments describing the request as part of an "open inquiry" into whether Mann had made "knowing inconsistencies" when applying for research funding. Cuccinelli said "In light of the Climategate e-mails, there does seem to at least be an argument to be made that a course was undertaken by some of the individuals involved, including potentially Michael Mann, where they were steering a course to reach a conclusion". He added that "Our act, frankly, just requires honesty."&lt;ref name="Helderman2010-05-04" /&gt; In a television interview on 5 May he said "We aren't targeting scientific conclusions. That's not the issue. It's the expenditure of taxpayer dollars."&lt;ref name="Helderman2010-05-06b"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Helderman | first = Rosalind   | title = Virginia Politics Blog - Cuccinelli says he is not "targeting scientific conclusions" in U-Va. demand  | url = http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/05/cuccinelli_says_his_not_target.html | publisher = ''Washington Post'' | date = 6 May 2010 | accessdate = 15 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university responded on 5 May with a position statement which noted that four of the five named research grants were from federal organisations outside Virginia.  The CID referred to FATA provisions on financial fraud, but Cuccinelli's comments in the ''Washington Post'' and the unusual nature of the CID "strongly suggest that the investigation is motivated primarily by differences of opinion regarding the scientific basis for current understanding of climate change." They considered his actions inappropriate in scientific inquiry; "His action and the potential threat of legal prosecution of scientific endeavor that has satisfied peer-review standards send a chilling message to scientists engaged in basic research involving Earth’s climate and indeed to scholars in any discipline. Such actions directly threaten academic freedom and, thus, our ability to generate the knowledge upon which informed public policy relies."&lt;ref name="UVA_Position_Statement2010-05-05" /&gt;

== Initial public reaction ==
Cuccinelli's demand prompted an outcry about the case's threat to academic freedom.&lt;ref name="Walker2010-06-29" /&gt; Mann said that he believed that Cuccinelli was "simply trying to smear me as part of a larger campaign to discredit my science".&lt;ref name="Helderman2010-05-04" /&gt; Nineteen professors at Virginia's [[Old Dominion University]] issued a statement saying that Cuccinelli's actions "echo some of the worst offenses of the McCarthy era", alluding to the anti-Communist investigations of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] in the 1950s. They demanded that he "cease and desist from this and further 'witch hunts' driven by partisan political agendas that waste valuable state resources in a difficult economy."&lt;ref name="WalkerWalzer2010-05-08" /&gt; U.Va.'s Faculty Senate issued a statement&lt;ref name="UVA_Position_Statement2010-05-05" /&gt; criticizing the investigation as being politically motivated and "an inappropriate way to engage with the process of scientific inquiry" which "directly threaten[s] academic freedom" by "send[ing] a chilling message to scientists engaged in basic research involving Earth's climate and indeed to scholars in any discipline."&lt;ref name="UVA_Position_Statement2010-05-05" /&gt;

Eight hundred university faculty members across the US signed a petition organized by the Union of Concerned Scientists, which said in a statement: "Much of Virginia's scientific and academic community is appalled that their attorney general has launched such a blatantly political investigation." The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Virginia and the [[American Association of University Professors]] also criticized Cuccinelli's actions,&lt;ref name="Walker2010-05-19" /&gt; commenting in a joint letter that "it is hard to conceive of the Attorney General's request ... as anything but a "fishing expedition" aimed at discrediting Dr. Mann's conclusions, rather than pursuing any reasonable suspicions of malfeasance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint letter to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia|url=http://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/E79B03E1-7EB9-4B13-B8DA-4324E2928CB7/0/Wynneletter.pdf|publisher=ACLU of Virginia &amp; American Association of University Professors|date=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement by the directors of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] said that "scientists should not be subjected to fraud investigations simply for providing scientific results that may be controversial or inconvenient" and that investigations such as those Cuccinelli has initiated against Mann "could have a long-lasting and chilling effect on a broad spectrum of research fields that are critical to a range of national interests from public health to national security to the environment."&lt;ref name="AAAS2010-05-18" /&gt;

The science journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published an editorial describing the investigation as "an ideologically motivated inquisition that harasses and intimidates climate scientists" and noted it had been condemned even by climate change skeptics.&lt;ref name="NatureEd2010-05-13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS_Article2010-08-25" /&gt; Chip Knappenberger, assistant to global warming skeptic [[Patrick Michaels]], said just as he "didn't like it when the politicians came after Pat Michaels," he "[doesn't] like it that the politicians are coming after Mike Mann."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readthehook.com/blog/index.php/2010/04/29/oh-mann-cuccinelli-targets-uva-papers-in-climategate-salvo/ |title=Oh, Mann: Cuccinelli targets UVA papers in Climategate salvo &amp;#124; The Hook News Blog |publisher=Readthehook.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100702231326/http://www.readthehook.com/blog/index.php/2010/04/29/oh-mann-cuccinelli-targets-uva-papers-in-climategate-salvo/| archivedate= 2 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Washington Post]]'' said in an editorial that Cuccinelli had "declared war on the freedom of academic inquiry" and that he had demonstrated "a dangerous disregard for scientific method and academic freedom."&lt;ref name="WaPoEd2010-05-07" /&gt; In a subsequent editorial the newspaper applauded U.Va's decision to resist the demand and highlighted the potential cost of the precedent being set by Cuccinelli, noting that "if researchers at state institutions are unwilling to stick their necks out in case a state official dislikes their findings, scientific progress at the commonwealth's universities will screech to a halt, talented faculty will leave, and the best and brightest students will go elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U-Va. admirably resists Mr. Cuccinelli's fishing expedition|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/28/AR2010052804517.html?nav=rss_opinions|work=Washington Post|date=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Litigation involving original Civil Investigative Demand ==

Many scientists urged the university to resist. On 27 May U.Va. filed a petition with [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]] [[Virginia Circuit Court|Circuit Court]] asking a judge to dismiss Cuccinelli's demand. The university argued that Cuccinelli had issued a vague, non-specific demand that exceeded his statutory authority: "Investigating the merits of a university researcher's methodology, results and conclusions (on climate change or any topic) goes far beyond the Attorney General's limited statutory power". The petition connected Cuccinelli's actions with his ongoing litigation about federal environmental policy and regulation.&lt;ref name="Walker2010-05-28" /&gt; It argued in a subsequent brief that the demand was "fundamentally legally flawed".&lt;ref name="Walker2010-06-29" /&gt;

Cuccinelli filed a brief in response on 11 June asserting that he had a right to demand climate change records, arguing that "neither academic freedom nor the First Amendment have ever been held to immunize a person, whether an academic or not, from civil or criminal actions for fraud, let alone immunized them from an otherwise authorized investigation."&lt;ref name="Walker2010-06-19" /&gt; The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] noted that the brief based its arguments on emails from the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]], but said it misrepresented emails and took them out of context. Shortly afterwards, Penn State university Investigatory Inquiry announced that it had unanimously "determined that there is no substance" to the allegations against Mann.&lt;ref name="dailyprogress 100702"&gt;{{Cite web|last=McNeill |first=Brian |title=Advocacy group: Errors `riddle&amp;#39; Cuccinelli claim on UVa climate papers |url=http://www2.dailyprogress.com/news/cdp-news-local/2010/jul/02/advocacy_group_errors_riddle_cuccinelli_claim_on_u-ar-319064/ |publisher=Daily Progress |date=2 July 2010 |accessdate=20 March 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;br&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ken Cuccinelli Makes Basic Factual Errors About Mike Mann's Research, Stolen Emails in Response to UVA |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/ken-cuccinelli-uvs-respose-mann-0417.html |publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] |date=1 July 2010 |accessdate=20 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422193052/http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/ken-cuccinelli-uvs-respose-mann-0417.html |archivedate=22 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A follow-up brief filed on 13 July again asserted Cuccinelli's authority and questioned Mann's scientific findings,&lt;ref name="Walker2010-07-13" /&gt; asserting that Mann and other scientists had manipulated scientific conclusions to produce results that could be used to support the regulation of [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Helderman2010-07-20" /&gt; The  Union of Concerned Scientists described it as making basic errors based on claims from the [[hockey stick controversy]] taken out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last= |first= |title=Latest Court Filing from Ken Cuccinelli Continues to Make Basic Scientific Errors |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/cuccinelli-court-filing-basic-errors-0430.html#5 |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |date=1 August 2010 |accessdate=20 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331120815/http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/cuccinelli-court-filing-basic-errors-0430.html |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.Va. responded by questioning Cuccinelli's motives, stating that his demand was "aimed squarely at Dr. Mann's scientific conclusions" and that more than a third of the attorney general's brief "is devoted to challenging and criticizing the research and conclusions of Dr. Mann and his co-authors." The University argued that given the importance of protecting academic freedom the court should not permit the attorney general to exceed his statutory power, and that "such a potentially invasive investigative tool should not be permitted to be used to target academics merely because the Attorney General disputes the legitimacy of their research and conclusions."&lt;ref name="ODell2010-07-20" /&gt; It noted that four of the grants queried by Cuccinelli were received from the federal government and were therefore not covered by the Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act, while the fifth was awarded before the statute was enacted in 2003. U.Va. argued that much of the information demanded by Cuccinelli had nothing to do with any of the five grants and was "not even remotely tailored to an investigation of a potential [fraud statute] investigation."&lt;ref name="Helderman2010-06-29" /&gt; The presiding judge, Cheryl V. Higgins, agreed to stay Cuccinelli's demand pending further oral hearings due to take place in late August.&lt;ref name="Helderman2010-06-22" /&gt;

On August 20, 2010, Albermarle Circuit Court Judge Paul Peatross heard argument on when Cuccinelli should get the requested data, including emails between Mann and his research assistants, secretaries and 39 other scientists across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge to rule on Cuccinelli probe of climate study|work=Washington Post|date=August 21, 2010|page=B1|first=Anita|last=Kumar}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the court's ruling issued on August 30, 2010, the judge concluded that the university was a proper subject for a Civil Investigative Demand which could investigate "grants made with Commonwealth of Virginia funds to professors such as Dr. Mann", but not the federal grants. However, the demands did not show "reason to believe" that the university held relevant material, or meet the statute requirements to state "the nature of the conduct" so that "any reasonable person could glean what Dr. Mann did to violate the statute". The court completely rejected the demands, but left it open for the "Commonwealth to proceed according to the law".&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010-08-30%20Opinion%20Granting%20UVA%20Petition.pdf Ruling]. Retrieved 2010-08-31.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, Cuccinelli could either rewrite the civil investigative demand or appeal the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge rejects Cuccinelli's probe of U-Va.|first=Rosalind|last=Helderman|date=August 31, 2010|work=Washington Post|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/breaking/wb/258716 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20100901123111/http://www.roanoke.com/news/breaking/wb/258716 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 1, 2010 |work=Roanoke Times |title=Judge denies Cuccinelli's demand for climate scientist's records; AG not backing down |date=August 30, 2010 |first=Michael |last=Sluss |accessdate=2010-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.dailyprogress.com/news/2010/aug/30/judge-sides-uva-climate-case-dismissing-cuccinelli-ar-479678/{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mann called the ruling a victory "for all scientists who live in fear that they may be subject to a {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated witch hunt when their research findings prove inconvenient to powerful vested interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/breaking/wb/258716 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20100901123111/http://www.roanoke.com/news/breaking/wb/258716 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 1, 2010 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second Civil Investigative Demand ==

On September 29, 2010, Cuccinelli filed a revised CID in order to address some of the shortcomings identified in the August 30 ruling.  The main changes were narrowing the case to the only one of the five original grants which was not a federal grant and stating the specific allegation of fraud: he referred to the Mann, Bradley and Hughes 1998 and 1998 [[hockey stick graph|"hockey stick"]] hemispheric climate reconstructions (MBH98 and MBH99), and said  "Specifically, but without limitation, some of the conclusions of the papers demonstrate a complete lack of rigor regarding the statistical analysis of the alleged data, meaning that the result reported lacked statistical significance without a specific statement to that effect." Mann noted that the grant concerned was for  research into the interaction between the atmosphere and vegetation in the African savannah, and did not relate to climate reconstructions. The University of Virginia announced that it would fight the request, and stated that resisting the Attorney General's demands had already cost it $350,000 in legal fees, paid from private funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/04/AR2010100406825.html|work=Washington Post|title=Virginia fight over climate documents will continue|date=October 5, 2010|first=Rosalind |last=Helderman|accessdate=2010-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 20, 2010, the University of Virginia filed papers requesting that Cuccinelli’s latest demand be “set aside” as well. UVa’s lawyers pointed out that Cuccinelli’s latest CID recites verbatim the first 15 pages of the attorney general’s brief in opposition to UVa’s petition to dismiss the previous CIDs. They stated that the text had already been considered by the court and “found deficient.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.madison-news.com/news/mce-news/2010/oct/21/uva-seeks-dismissal-cuccinellis-latest-demand-ar-577737|work=Madison News|title=UVa seeks dismissal of Cuccinelli's latest demand|date=October 21, 2010|first=Brian|last=McNeil|accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Virginia Supreme Court Ruling ==

In March, 2011, the Supreme Court of Virginia decided to hear Cuccinelli's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.wsls.com/news/2011/mar/12/tdmet02-va-supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-cuccinelli-ar-900621/ |work=WSLS News |title=Va.

Supreme Court will hear U-Va. global warming case|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2011/03/va_supreme_court_will_hear_u-v.html|last=Helderman|first=Rosalind|date=11 March 2011|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March 2012 the Supreme Court ruled that Cuccinelli as Attorney General had no legal authority to demand the records from the university. Mann expressed pleasure at the outcome, but stated that "It's sad that so much money and resources had to be wasted on Cuccinelli's witch hunt against me and the University of Virginia, when it could have been invested, for example, in measures to protect Virginia's coastline from the damaging effects of sea-level rise it is already seeing." The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] applauded the reconfirmation that the demands lacked legal standing, and said that "Academic institutions have the responsibility to protect their faculty's ability to discover new things about our world without fearing harassment. Nobody should expect the rough drafts of their work to be subject to the same level of scrutiny as their published research." The Attorney General's office put out a statement that "From the beginning, we have said that we were simply trying to review documents that are unquestionably state property to determine whether or not fraud had been committed. Today, the court effectively held that state agencies do not have to provide state-owned property to state investigators looking into potential fraud involving government funds."&lt;ref name="Wapo 020312" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Graun 020312" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13302">'''Constructive ambiguity''' is a term generally credited to [[Henry Kissinger]], said to be the foremost exponent of the negotiating tactic it designates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Bill Keller]] |coauthors= |title=Mitt and Bibi: Diplomacy as Demolition Derby |url=http://keller.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/mitt-and-bibi-diplomacy-as-demolition-derby/?hp |quote=This approach is what diplomats call 'constructive ambiguity,' a phrase attributed to Henry Kissinger. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 12, 2012 |accessdate=2012-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the deliberate use of ambiguous language on a sensitive issue in order to advance some political purpose. Constructive ambiguity is often disparaged as [[Wiktionary:fudge#Verb|fudging]]. It might be employed in a negotiation, both to disguise an inability to resolve a contentious issue on which the parties remain far apart and to do so in a manner that enables each to claim obtaining some concession on it.

It warrants further hopes that the ensuing postponement of resolution on this particular point, in a way that causes neither side excessive discomfort, will enable them to make real progress on other matters. If this progress takes place, the unresolved question might be revisited at a later date, if not voided altogether by the passage of time. On the other hand, since ambiguity in agreements can generate subsequent controversy, the likelihood of its employment proving constructive in comparison to further attempts to negotiate the point in question in clear terms is a question best left for historians.

==Examples of constructive ambiguities in diplomacy==
===UN Security Council's Resolution 242===
The [[UN]] [[Security Council]] agreed on the text of the [[Resolution 242]] after the crushing defeat that [[Israel]] inflicted on joint [[Arab]] forces during the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. As a result of bargaining between the powers sitting in the Security Council, the resolution reflected the deeply polarized political opinion. The provision of the resolution which prompted different and incompatible interpretations was the one immediately following the preamble of the text, reading: "establishment of just and lasting peace in the Middle East should include the application of both the following principles:
* withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in recent conflict;
* termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for…territorial integrity…of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries."

The use of an unnatural English construction "territories occupied in recent conflict" without the expected definite article, "the", made it possible to question whether Israel was asked to withdraw from all the territories occupied in the recent conflict, or to withdraw from some, but not all, such territories. Notably, the French translation of the document, unlike the English original, used the definite article, demanding the "retrait des forces armées israéliennes &lt;u&gt;des&lt;/u&gt; territoires occupés lors du récent conflit". Thus the French version, which together with the English version was an official UN version of the document, suggested that Israel must withdraw from all territories that it occupied during the Six-Day War.

Naturally, the French interpretation suited the interests of Arab countries, which made numerous attempts to prove its validity. By contrast, Israel opposed such an interpretation, and the sponsor of the resolution, [[Hugh Foot, Baron Caradon|Lord Caradon]], appears to have had no intention of inserting the definite article into its text. Caradon additionally emphasized the additional and clarifying light that the second part of the first provision shed on its first part, and insisted that it must be given uppermost consideration. According to him, the boundary that existed before the Six-Day War did not satisfy the right of Israel to live within secure and recognised boundaries. Consequently, under this interpretation, Israel did not have to withdraw to its pre–Six-Day War borders.

===The Shanghai Communiqué===
The [[Shanghai Communiqué]] was issued by the [[United States|United States of America]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] on 27 February 1972, during the US President [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Nixon visit to China 1972|visit to China]]. Henry Kissinger acted as the principal US negotiator in this matter. The document contained an ambiguous provision inserted by the United States: "The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the [[Taiwan Strait]] maintain there is but one China and that [[Taiwan]] is a province of China." This provision lent itself to interpretation as the very first expression of American support for the [[one-China policy]], calling for a reintegration of Taiwan into the PRC. But that is not what it meant in its original context.

The fact acknowledged by the US "that the PRC and Taiwan agree that there is "but one China"  does not imply any sort of agreement on internal arrangements for the "one China." On the contrary, for as long as the Taiwan issue has been posed, Chinese governments on either side of the Taiwan Strait have been unable to agree on a formula for their reunification, let alone to have it supported by the US government. Nevertheless, its official endorsement of the term “one China” helped the US to find a proper balance between its relations with the PRC and its relations with Taiwan, without jeopardizing either. Its use reflected a negotiated instance of constructive ambiguity that reduced the immediate risk of open conflict.

===6-Point Agreement===
In the wake of the [[Yom Kippur War]] between Israel and [[Egypt]], both negotiators and belligerents faced the issue of the status of the Egyptian Third Army, surrounded by the [[Israeli Defense Force]] on the eastern side of [[Suez]]. Almost no progress was achieved in the first phase of peace talks held in October. While the talks continued in Washington in November, the UN Security Council issued [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 340|Resolution 340]], which demanded that the Israeli Force withdraw to the lines occupied on October 22, 1973, at 1650 GMT, causing an end to the encirclement of the Egyptian Third Army. However, Israel refused to comply with Resolution 340. Thereafter negotiations fortunately continued and resulted in a so-called "6-Point Agreement", signed on November 11 at Kilometer 101 of the [[Cairo]]-Suez road. It was the first agreement that Israel signed with an Arab country after the outbreak of hostilities between Arabs and Israelis in 1949.

One of the chief mediators to the agreement, Henry Kissinger, US Secretary of State, frequently used the term "constructive ambiguity" during the negotiations, to explain his negotiating strategy as well as the key purpose of the 6-Point Agreement. Provision B of the agreement contained an ambiguity that created an incentive for Israeli negotiators to engage in further talks leading to Israel's compliance with SC Resolution 340 and ensured that talks continue and arrive at a solution that would save the face of one of the two parties. This result could not have been achieved by a quick jump or a fiat.

Provision B says: "Both sides agree that discussions between them will begin immediately to settle the question of the return to the October 22 positions in the framework of agreement on the disengagement and separation of forces under the auspices of the UN." This provided for a syntactical ambiguity that allowed Egyptian and Israeli negotiators to interpret their accord in diametrically opposite ways. Egyptian negotiators interpreted this provision as a clear demand that Israel withdraw its armed force in accordance with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 340]], linking "return to the October 22 positions" and "under the auspices of the UN". By contrast, Israeli negotiators interpreted the provision as calling on the parties to negotiate a "separation of forces" agreement without any specific request to return to the October 22 lines, by linking "discussions... to settle the question" and "under the auspices of the UN".

===Syrian–Israeli peace negotiations===
In the course of the [[Syria]]n–Israeli peace negotiations, the call for a "comprehensive, just, and lasting peace" was replaced by the formula of "full peace for full withdrawal" in May 1993. The former requirement tended to link the Syrian–Israeli talks to the Palestinian and other negotiating tracks, whereas the latter formula of "full peace for full withdrawal" tended to sever such links and ties in favor of a separate settlement that "stands on its two feet", as the Israelis put it. This short-lived "constructive ambiguity" may have witnessed a face-saving attempt by Syrian President [[Hafez Asad]] to maintain coordination among the different Arab-Israeli negotiating tracks while offering Israel a full contractual peace in return for the Golan Heights. The revelation of the [[Oslo Accords]] between Israel and the [[PLO]] in the summer of 1993 effectively ended this ambiguity, whereas the subsequent [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]] of October 1994 rendered it irrelevant. Syria's neighbors, for their part, no longer sought "comprehensive peace".

===Sinn Féin===
[[Sinn Féin]] is a political party in Northern Ireland that was often affiliated with terrorism while pursuing [[United Ireland|Irish unity]]. US [[Northern Ireland]] Special Envoy [[Mitchell Reiss]] has [https://digitalarchive.wm.edu/bitstream/handle/10288/422/VA%20Informer%20February%2013%2c%202008%20Edition.pdf pointed out] its cynical use of constructive ambiguity, when in the 1990s, Sinn Féin adopted a strategy labeled as "TUAS". Within the policy document, this acronym meant "Tactical Use of Armed Struggle"; however, the same acronym was publicly translated to mean "Totally Unarmed Strategy."

== Constructive ambiguities in international trade law ==
Some recent [[bilateral trade agreements]] such as the [[Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement]] (AUSFTA) and [[Republic of Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement]] (KORUSFTA)have produced final texts after contentious and largely unresolved negotiations about whether, for example, [[pharmaceutical]] [[innovation]] (a constructive ambiguity) should be 'valued' (also a constructive ambiguity) through the operation of nominally competitive markets (requiring strong [[anti-trust]] law to be effective) (the United States position) or through expert evidence-based assessment of objectively demonstrated [[cost-effectiveness]] (the Australian and Korean positions).&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA. Reference pricing for pharmaceuticals: is the Australia-United States free trade agreement affecting Australia's pharmaceutical benefits scheme? Med J Aust 2007; 187: 240-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern has been expressed in the academic literature that the inclusion of [[non-violation nullification of benefits]] (NVNB)provisions in such [[bilateral trade agreements]] could encourage ongoing [[lobbying]] by [[multinational corporations]] of domestic policy makers to pass [[legislation]] rewarding their version of the trade deal mentioned constructive ambiguity of [[innovation]] (see Annex 2C.1 of the AUSFTA) causing issues for democratic [[sovereignty]] over domestic policy.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA, Neville W and Anton Wasson A.

The '''Cotton Mill Women's Strikes''' occurred in 1845 through 1848 in [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania|Allegheny City]], now [[Pittsburgh]]. It was an organized effort of the 1,500 women laborers to prevent their employers to force them to work twelve hour work days. It also ended [[Child labour|child labor]] in the mills.&lt;ref&gt;McCollester, Charles and Howard Scott.

[[File:Customs-House-Brisbane-2.jpg|thumb|250px|The Customs House in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]]]

A '''custom house''' or '''customs house''' was a building housing the offices for the government officials who processed the paperwork associated with importing and exporting goods into and out of a country.  Customs officials also collected [[customs (tax)|customs duty]] on imported goods.

The custom house was typically located in a [[seaport]] or in a city on a major river, with access to the ocean.  These cities acted as a [[port of entry]] into a country.  The government stationed officials at such locations to collect taxes and regulate commerce.

Due to advances in electronic information systems, the increased volume of international trade, and the introduction of air travel, the term "custom house" is now often an historical anachronism.  There are many examples of buildings around the world that were formerly used as custom houses but have since been converted for other uses, such as museums or civic buildings.

In the [[United Kingdom]], since 1386, the phrase ''custom house'' has been in use over the term ''customs house''.  This was after a "[[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]]" was erected at Wool Wharf in [[Tower (ward)|Tower Ward]], to contain just the officials of the Great Custom on Wool and Woolfells.  The singular form was used even though in later years the Custom House was the location of other Customs officials as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Smith, Graham |date=1980|title=Something To Declare|page=6|publisher=Harrap &amp; Co.

The [[Parliament of the Czech Republic]] vote of no confidence in the current [[Government of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic government]] of the [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]] [[Bohuslav Sobotka]] was held on Tuesday 26 May 2015.&lt;ref name=VfNC&gt;{{cite news|title=Vote of no confidence scheduled for next week|url=http://praguepost.com/czech-news/47912-vote-of-no-confidence-scheduled-for-next-week|accessdate=24 May 2015|newspaper=[[The Prague Post]]|date=22 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524213453/http://praguepost.com/czech-news/47912-vote-of-no-confidence-scheduled-for-next-week|archivedate=24 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vote was initiated because of opposition concerns about conflicts of interest on the part of Finance Minister [[Andrej Babiš]].&lt;ref name=Slams&gt;{{cite news|last1=Velinger|first1=Jan|title=Opposition slams government, finance minister, in no confidence vote proceedings|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/opposition-slams-government-finance-minister-in-no-confidence-vote-proceedings|accessdate=19 June 2015|work=Radio Prague|date=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vote of no confidence was called by the three opposition political parties - [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|ODS]], [[TOP 09]] and [[Dawn of Direct Democracy|Úsvit]] (''Dawn'') on 21 May 2015 as step against [[Finance Minister of the Czech Republic]] [[Andrej Babiš]].&lt;ref name=ABF&gt;{{cite news|title=Plané gesto nebo zdržování, opozice chce hlasovat o nedůvěře vládě (in Czech)|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/312308-plane-gesto-nebo-zdrzovani-opozice-chce-hlasovat-o-neduvere-vlade/|accessdate=24 May 2015|newspaper=[[ČT24]]|date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Result ==
The vote of no confidence to the Government was unsuccessful as only 47 legislators supported no confidence when 101 were needed. 105 Members of Parliament voted against no confidence and 32 MP's abstained. 16 legislators did not attend the meeting of the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]].&lt;ref name=Result&gt;{{cite news|title=Opozice s vyslovením nedůvěry Sobotkově vládě neuspěla (in Czech)|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/312883-opozice-s-vyslovenim-neduvery-sobotkove-vlade-neuspela/|accessdate=27 May 2015|newspaper=[[ČT24]]|date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Garrard left school at 16 and joined an estate agency.&lt;ref name="RubinsteinJolles2011"/&gt; He co-founded [[Minerva PLC]] with [[Andrew Rosenfeld]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/andrew-rosenfeld-wpd0ffjw3rz|title=Andrew Rosenfeld|author=|date=10 February 2015|work=The Times|accessdate=1 April 2018}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; a property investment and development company, whose shares are quoted in the [[Stock Exchange|London Stock Exchange]] [[FTSE 250 Index]], and served as its [[chairman]] for many years until his retirement in March 2005.&lt;ref name="RubinsteinJolles2011"/&gt; Before co-founding Minerva, Garrard worked as a financial adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2f64a0d4-1678-11e4-a5c7-00144feabdc0|title=Property tycoon Sir David Garrard gives £500,000 to Labour party|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-19|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he set up a venture capital business with his son in law Alexander Salter, but the two fell out when Salter and Garrard's daughter divorced in 2013, leading to a High Court case.&lt;ref name=transfer/&gt;

Garrard was listed by the [[Sunday Times Rich List 2005]] as the joint 451st richest person in the UK, with a fortune in excess of £100 million,{{cn|date=March 2018}} falling to 575th with £95 million [[Sunday Times Rich List 2009|in 2009]].&lt;ref name=st-20090426&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sir-david-garrard-and-family-qlmnxjk7qd3 |title=Sir David Garrard and family|work=The Sunday Times|location=London |date=26 April 2009 |accessdate=1 April 2018}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Garrard was involved in a legal dispute with his former son-in-law related to an alleged attempted transfer of £2.5 million from a bank account and the appointment of [[Jonathan Mendelsohn|Lord Mendelsohn]] as a director of jointly owned companies.&lt;ref name=telegraph-20140716&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/10969400/Labour-donor-tried-to-transfer-2.5m-from-daughter-and-son-in-laws-joint-account.html |title=Labour donor 'tried to transfer £2.5m from daughter and son-in-law's joint account' |last=Rayner |first=Gordon |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=16 July 2014 |accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement with Labour Party==
In 2002 the first [[Academy (English school)|city academy]] under a new Labour programme, [[Business Academy Bexley]], was opened by prime minister [[Tony Blair]] with Garrard as principal sponsor with a financial contribution of £2.5 million. Garrard chaired its governing body.&lt;ref name=bbc-20020910&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2249188.stm |title=Academy opens doors to the future |work=BBC News |date=10 September 2002 |accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph-20040915&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/3344116/Beacon-school-takes-on-Ofsted.html |title='Beacon' school takes on Ofsted |last=Lightfoot |first=Liz |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=15 September 2004 |accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]] Garrard secretly provided the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] with a loan of £2.3&amp;nbsp;million at a time when loans on commercial terms did not have to be declared,&lt;ref name=ft-20140728/&gt; to be repaid on 28 April 2007.&lt;ref name=transfer&gt;{{cite news|last=Rayner|first=Gordon|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/10969400/Labour-donor-tried-to-transfer-2.5m-from-daughter-and-son-in-laws-joint-account.html|title=Labour donor 'tried to transfer £2.5m from daughter and son-in-law's joint account'|date=16 July 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/labfullloandetails.cfm#loan28 |title=Labour Party full details of borrowings |publisher=Electoral Commission |accessdate=2007-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618202318/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/labfullloandetails.cfm#loan28 |archivedate=2007-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the discovery of the loan in the course of the [[Cash for Honours]] political scandal in the UK, Garrard withdrew his nomination for a [[Peerage of the United Kingdom|peerage]].&lt;ref name=ft-20140728/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wintour|first=Patrick|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/mar/21/uk.partyfunding1|title=Labour seeks to damp down scandal by naming sources of £13.9m loans|work=The Guardian|date=21 March 2006|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seib|first=Christine|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/allders-workers-rail-against-peerage-for-garrard-m523kd3sq9m|title=Allders workers rail against peerage for Garrard|work=The Times|date=9 November 2005|accessdate=31 March 2018}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loan was extended, and Gerrard eventually called for it to be repaid in 2015, in a reaction against [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2015|the election of]] [[Jeremy Corbyn]] as leader of the Labour Party.&lt;ref name=times-20151004&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lyons|first1=James|last2=Woolf|first2=Marie|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/top-labour-backer-calls-in-pound2m-loan-as-donors-revolt-bkgkltb7pjk |title=Top Labour backer calls in £2m loan as donors revolt|work=The Times|location=London|date=4 October 2015 |accessdate=1 April 2018}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[digital divide]]''' is an [[economic inequality|economic]] and [[social inequality]] with regard to access to, use of, or impact of [[information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICT).&lt;ref name="NTIA95"&gt;U.S. Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). (1995). ''Falling through the net: A survey of the ''have nots'' in rural and urban America''. Retrieved from, http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fallingthru.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Factors causing the divide can vary depending on the country and culture, as can the potential solutions for minimizing or closing the divide.

The following is a list of countries that have a digital divide along with contributing factors and steps the country is taking to resolve the issue.

== Argentina ==
{{see also|Internet in Argentina}}

The digital divide in Argentina is the term used to describe the technological and connectivity gap between different demographics and regions, specifically the gaps present in the country of Argentina. The availability and access to the Internet in Argentina shows how the trends of a digital divide stay constant, even across different countries and cultures. Age is one of the main factors, and Argentina's statistics show a common disparity between ages. According to TNS Infratest, the age group with the highest rate of daily internet users in 2016 were users under 25. 91% of that age demographic were polled as being daily internet users. In contrast, the age group with the lowest rate were users over 55, with only 68% of that demographic being daily internet users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/339986/daily-internet-usage-age-group-argentina/|title=Daily internet usage in Argentina by age group 2016 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older one is, the less likely they are to use Internet, and these statistics reflect that. The way that users are able to access the Internet can also show the status of Internet and how easily one can utilize it. In Argentina, 48% of users preferred to use a smartphone or tablet to a computer, 29% used them equally, and 16% preferred a computer to a smartphone or tablet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/370255/preferred-devices-for-internet-access-argentina/|title=Preferred devices for internet access in Argentina 2016 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education ===
The quality of life in Argentina is among one of the highest in South and Latin America, according to InterNations. The children are well educated in school, and they are given numerous opportunities to pursue afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.internations.org/argentina-expats/guide/living-in-argentina-15328/education-in-argentina-3|title=Education in Argentina|website=www.internations.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government created a project named "Conectar Igualdad" (Connecting Equality) where they distribute netbooks to students and teachers in primary school, special needs schools, and state institutes. Since the project began nearly 4,000,000 netbooks have been dispersed amongst them to 400 different schools and 7,500 different teachers. The program works in three parts: an internet connection to Wi-Fi, an established internet connection through a reliable network (giving students Internet access anywhere, even at home), and making use of a syntonizer for Digital TV, allowing students access to interactive live programs. In 2011, the Government launched another program named "Escuelas de Innovacion" (Schools of Innovation). The main goal is to guarantee students better access to education and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalstatement.wordpress.com/2014/09/22/argentina-projects-encouraging-digital-education/|title=Argentina: Projects encouraging digital education|date=2014-09-22|work=Global Statement: A blog of the Swiss ERI-Network|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of Argentina creates new and innovative projects each year for students and teachers to have greater access to the Internet. It plays an important role in their education and is a great opportunity for students and teachers to close the gap in the digital divide.

However, only a handful on people and communities are being represented. Underdeveloped geographical locations, like the continent of Africa serves as one of the underrepresented minorities. In a study conducted in 2011, they estimate that internet access is only available to roughly fourteen percent of the African population.&lt;sup&gt;[[Internet in Africa#cite note-8|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; This means that while the world’s population is only composed of fifteen percent of Africans, around six percent of that subscribe to the internet. &lt;sup&gt;[[Internet in Africa#cite note-WorldStats-9|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Education ===
{{Main|Education in Bangladesh}}
The education system in Bangladesh is divided up into three stages of schooling: primary school, secondary school, and a level of more formal education. Primary school lasts for five years for children aged 6 to 10, secondary school lasts for seven years, and the formal education level can last anywhere from two to six years. Government policies have been implanted since 2000 that has caused the [[Information technology|Information Technology (IT)]] industry to grow in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shinkai|first=Naoko|last2=Hossain|first2=Monzur|date=June 2011|title=Productivity and Performance of IT Sector in Bangladesh: Evidence from the Firm Level Data|jstor=23339841|journal=The Bangladesh Development Series|volume=34|issue=2|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students started going to school in order to become a part of this growing workforce, taking lessons in English language, analytical thinking, and software development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The youth of Bangladesh are becoming educated in the technology available, which is a step in ending Bangladesh’s part in the global digital divide. A country can have access to technology but if the people do not understand how to use the technology than there is no difference between having it or not. Satisfaction and gratification from using the technology are key points in bridging the gap because the sense of accomplishment give the people confidence to use the technology.

== Colombia ==
{{see also|Internet in Colombia}}
The digital divide in Colombia refers to the absence of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and how it affects Colombian individuals and its society as a whole. The main lapse of technology and information lies in the physical access realm of things, where it is lacking tremendously. Though Internet in Colombia has made progress compared to recent years, the scholary part of how ICTs are used are still in question. With this being said, government officials have made certain that access to ICTs be a priority in their country. In addition to physical access, literature review and types of internet use have also been main points of focus in regards to a solution for digital divide in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Velasquez|first1=Alcides|title=Digital Divide in Colombia: The Role of Motivational and Material Access in the Use and Types of Use of ICTs|journal=International Journal of Communication|date=2013|volume=7|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/download/2180/969|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of Internet Use (ICT) ===
There is a difference between material or physical access and actual use of ICTs. "According to Hargittai (2008),
differences in the uses of ICTs have important implications for life outcomes". "Rojas and Puig-i-abril (2009) found that the most prevalent activities of Internet users in Colombia were checking e-mail, consuming entertainment content, chatting with friends, and consuming news and information." There are different levels of "use" including, non-use, low use, and frequent use while also taking into consideration the opportunities taken by the users. There is a difference in those who go online just for fun and those who use the internet for the improvement of themselves. 
(International Journal of Communication (19328036)) (Digital Divide in Colombia: The Role of Motivational and Material Access in the Use and Types of Use of ICTs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Velasquez|first1=Alcides|date=2013|title=Digital Divide in Colombia: The Role of Motivational and Material Access in the Use and Types of Use of ICTs|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=f151dc7b-5ad1-4f82-9162-8ebbbbc6f443%40sessionmgr101&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=ufh&amp;AN=99140318|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=7|pages=1768–1783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical Access ===
One digital divide study displayed physical access as "having"/"not having" access to the internet. Those who are less fortunate have been shown to lack educational advantage, due to the fact of not having access to internet as common as those who are more fortunate in wealth. Communities that are more technological advanced offers their communities to expand their knowledge and be able to communicate with other worlds. The intellectual advantage is common for countries, such as Colombia, where the poor communities are lacking the opportunities offered to those who are on the other side of town with more advantage. Poor communities are focusing on trying to make ends meet, and working hard labor without being offered to make a change to better themselves. The internet plays an important role in this, due to the fact that the internet provides opportunities to explore new jobs and to widen individuals' knowledge. In certain areas where the communities are wealthy, the internet is provided at the access of their hands. Being able to access the internet so easily, gives privileged individuals the chance to go beyond their expectations and get their point out into the world.

=== Causes of the Digital Divide in Colombia ===
There is no singular cause of the Digital Divide in Colombia. A number of different factors each contribute to the variance of access to technology within Colombia. These factors include location, economic class, education, and others.

In Colombia, those located in large cities are 69% more likely to use the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Velasquez|first=Alcides|date=January 2013|title=Digital Divide in Colombia|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=6&amp;sid=aa35d002-0e64-4818-aae4-32e576e1d4cb@sessionmgr4007|journal=International Journal of Communication (19328036)|volume=1768|pages=1772–1776|via=Discovery}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high correlation between the use of ICTs and location in large industrial cities is one of the most visible examples of digital divide in Colombia. People located in rural parts of Colombia are significantly less likely to use ICTs and the internet regularly for various reasons. One leading cause is simply because people living in rural parts of the country tend to be less educated which is negatively correlated with technology use. The pastoral parts of Colombia are often much less developed than the large cities. Often, these rustic areas lack the technology and internet providers needed to further bridge the digital divide between large and small cities. A study of the Digital Divide in Colombia concerning residency included a population in which 21.6% of respondents lived in a small or medium-sized city (&lt;1,000,000 inhabitants), while 78.4% lived in larger urban centers. This study showed that the vast majority of ICT usage occurred in large urban areas.

==== Technology Amongst Different Ideals and its Effect on the Economy====
The importance of technology and its relationship with economic development was synthesized by Solow (1987a) when he stated that “technology remains the dominant engine of growth, with human capital investment in second place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solow|first1=R.M.|title=Growth Theory and After|publisher=Stockholm|url=http://content.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=96960681&amp;S=R&amp;D=zbh&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeqLY4zOX0OLCmr0%2BeqLBSrq24S66WxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuslGvr7VMuePfgeyx43zxo%2Bt55%2BQA}}&lt;/ref&gt;” Concerning economic development and moves to improve it, it is an understood phenomena that countries with the highest availability and use of technology are the countries with the best economies. Technology has not advanced in all societies as far as many thought it would be according to today’s societal expectations. This lack of advancement mainly occurs in communities or organizations whose organizational context differentiates from a more skillful and high value profile to a context of autonomy. “In non-industrial contexts, non-computerized societies and organizations maintain more traditional routines, because they simultaneously face the absorption of techniques and instruments, while copying their preexisting idiosyncrasies, environments, and routines. In these cases change is perceived as expensive, time consuming and risky, producing sentiments that facilitate phobic, indifferent or stereotyped attitudes towards technology”.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zapata|first1=Cristian|title=The Digital Divide in the University: The Appropriation of ICT in Higher Education Students from Bogota, Colombia|url=http://content.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=96960681&amp;S=R&amp;D=zbh&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeqLY4zOX0OLCmr0%2BeqLBSrq24S66WxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuslGvr7VMuePfgeyx43zxo%2Bt55%2BQA|website=Media Educacion Research|publisher=Comunicar|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These preconceptions towards technology play a small role in the digital divide in Colombia. Among society’s who are not on the same accord in regards to technology and its benefits, attitudes towards technology show a distinct display of the amount of technological dependence a community has.

====Cultural Preservation vs. Cultural Modernization====
The two ideas of cultural preservation and cultural modernization create a divide amongst the world of industry and the world of agriculture. The industry field often involves research and development. Societies involving research and development often require skill in many different areas with products that's value is highly regarded. Both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the products creates a need for enhanced work material, which oftentimes is the latest and fastest technology. Industrially, in Colombia this is understood and industries strive, strengthening the different industries and corporations all over Colombia. Colombia’s somewhat, partial digital divide stems from areas of Colombia where locals are resistant to change. In 2003, Avgerou found this resistance to change to be due to the uncertainties of technology among the rural population. Gille referred to what was called the Technological System. This idea of Gilles suggested that technology would eventually transform social life all together by connecting technologies and everyday productive routines. Communities often adopt things that are for the betterment of the entire community. Rural populations and communities are often close knit and every one often shares the same views. The idea of technology is not necessarily one that everyone is going to agree with, especially when a community has done with out considerable updates to their prior owned technology for a long period of time. People admire their culture and want to see that it stay the same, with no flaws or inconsistencies. If the technological system adopted by the community is inconsistent or non-competitive, the host is limited by these gaps and builds and inefficient technical rationality.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The combination of reverence of community and culture, and possibilities of technological gaps delays technological advancement into many developing communities and this creates a digital divide. While information technology is thriving in the developed parts of Colombia with industries and corporations using it to their economic advantage, the rural and developing side of Colombia still has some ground to cover. This delayed progress of information technology can be mended through information technology programs that teach and enable developing communities how to use technology. Progress can also be made through built trust and reassurance through the government about modernized technology.

====Information Technology in Education====
Education is oftentimes viewed as the most important aspect of a society. The relationship between quantitative and qualitative productions of learning and the effort invested in the process, measured with respect to the goals set by the educative institution, the available resources and the needs from the environment, educational productivity is defined. Though education levels tend to depend largely on strength of the governments economy, other factors, including educational programs and community involvement can have an impactful effect. The country of Colombia is primarily rural and is mainly represented by remote areas. The general population of Colombia perceives the Internet as not useful and the purchasing power of Colombians is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GITR/2013/GITR_Chapter2.1_2013.pdf|title=Colombia's Digital Agenda: Successes and the Challenges Ahead|last1=Vega|first1=Diego|publisher=Ministry of Information and Communication Technologies of Colombia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This displays that access to technology is not necessarily essential and, or available. Communities from developing territories end up producing superficial changes in their tortuous transition to the new ICT paradigm, unable to keep up the pace in developing computer skills. The problem is not just the access to tools; it includes the construction of a compatible social, cultural and economic logic (Avgerou, 2003), that, due to the resistance to change from some of the local stakeholders, turns into a complex and slow process.&lt;ref name="Information Systems Journal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2575.2001.00095.x).|title=The Significance of Context in Information Systems and Organizational Change|last1=Avgerou|first1=C.|website=The Link between ICT and Economic Growth in the Discourse of Development|publisher=Springer|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves sacrificing some of the distinctive particularities of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=96960681&amp;S=R&amp;D=zbh&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeqLY4zOX0OLCmr0%2BeqLBSrq24S66WxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuslGvr7VMuePfgeyx43zxo%2Bt55%2BQA|title=The Digital Divide in the University: The Appropriation of ICT in Higher Education Students from Bogota, Colombia|last1=Zapata|first1=Cristian|website=Media Educación Research Journal|publisher=Comunicar|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Solutions to Digital Divide in Education ====
The CPE (Country Program Evaluation) allows the transfer of technology to rural areas to be a much smoother one by training teachers to properly use technological information. This knowledge is taken by teachers and aimed to increase levels of incorporation, adaptation, and integration of technologies as required for achievement of sustainable growth in Colombia, ensuring increased productivity and competitiveness while consolidating the quality of the Colombian educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GITR/2013/GITR_Chapter2.1_2013.pdf|title=Colombia's Digital Agenda: Successes and the Challengers Ahead|last1=Vega|first1=Diego|publisher=Ministry of Information and Communication Technologies of Colombia|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Colombia’s information technology presence in public schools are relatively normal. Areas of Colombia where poor educational infrastructure is combined with an economy focused on natural resources and its exploitation, are areas with school systems that focus on technical training concerning the production of basic goods rather than long term knowledge and innovation skills. In regards to higher education and universities in Colombia information technology infrastructure is growing at an alarming rate. From possessing updated technology in the classroom to technological information possessed by those in charge, ICT’s (Information Communication Technology) in the Colombian school system is currently at paramount.

=== Bridging The Digital  Divide ===

====Government Involvement====
In 2010, President Juan Manuel Santos launched ''Vive Digital,'' a government initiative aimed to create jobs, improve economic growth and development, and—most importantly—reduce poverty. ''Vive Digital'' does this all through the embracing of financial opportunities rooted in the production and utilization of technology. Within the past four years, Vive Digital has changed the digital landscape in Colombia. The largest impact has been on the poorest citizens. Colombia has gone from 3.1 million Internet broadband connections in 2010 to 9.9 million in mid-2014, and Internet penetration for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) increased from 7 percent in 2010 to more than 60 percent in 2014. Another initiative the Colombian government has served the people of Colombia with is the National Broadband Policy of the Ministerio de Tecnologías de la Información y las Comunicaciones (Ministry of Information Technology and Communications) which has increased the percentage of Colombian municipalities connected to the Internet from 17 percent in 2010 to 96 percent today.&lt;ref name="America's Quarterly"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vega|first1=Diego Molano|title=Colombia's Internet Advantage|url=http://www.americasquarterly.org/content/colombias-internet-advantage|website=America's Quarterly|publisher=AMERICAS SOCIETY/ COUNCIL OF THE AMERICAS|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"By 2018, the government hopes to have 63 percent of the country connected to broadband. And according to 2013 GSMA mobile economy figures, there are already 43.9 million mobile connections and 24 million mobile users in a country whose 47 million people give it the third largest population in Latin America and third largest Spanish-speaking population in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Egusa|first1=Conrad|title=Colombia Is One Of Latin America’s Most Promising New Tech Hubs|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/22/an-overview-of-colombia-one-of-latin-americas-most-promising-new-tech-hubs/|website=techcrunch.com|publisher=tech crunch|accessdate=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Hughes Network Systems LLC, one of the leading broadband solutions and providing services in the world, was granted a contract for an HX broadband satellite system and terminals by HISPASAT Colombia. This contract came as the result of the ''Vive Digital'' government initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=a0e98037-65de-45ec-a7c0-8757ca242454@sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=14E01172442C11C8&amp;db=edsnbk|title=United States : Hughes Technology Selected by HISPASAT to Bridge Digital Di...: Discovery|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes Network's increased presence within Colombia has exponentially increased the use of information and communication technologies in Colombia.

There are two main issues with the digital divide in Colombia that is being researched on. Those two are: how the information is being delivered and, how the information that is being delivered throughout the academic community is working and communicating. The solutions to these issues is getting everyone to focus on the main idea that the way they are communicating with the community is important and vital to civilization. It is important to send out accurate information, and not inform the community with false accusations. Research has shown that the delivery of information has become a vital aspect to Colombia and it includes the way everyone lives their daily lives. Researchers are focusing on the wide spectrum of how information is being spread, whether it is via internet, digital broadcast, mobile communication, or social media networks. With all of the research, it has also been noted to inform the community with the production of interpersonal communication and improvement in technological developments. The goal of the research is to improve the digital divide for Colombia's community to provide an adequate form of communication via the participating communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gronemeyer|first=M.E.|last2=Condeza|first2=Rayen|date=2013|title=Latin America: A Diversity of Approaches to Explore, Share and Discuss|url=|journal=International Journal Of Communication|volume=7|pages=1892–1895|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital divide in Ethiopia has caused a massive lack of information for many poorer individuals, however, the greatest failure relates to education. Between intense government regulation as well as economic factors, it is nearly impossible for the average person to access the internet. With such a gross lack of access to technology and the internet, education is stunted and children are forced to rely on archaic, biased, and often unreliable sources of information.&amp;nbsp;

The CIA notes that only 15% of the Ethiopian population is connected to the Internet placing the country at 107 of the 217 countries ranked in the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2153rank.html#et|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
In 2016, the Ethiopian government blocked all social media sites after an anonymous user posted copies of university entrance exams online. In an interview with Reuters News Agency, Mohammed Seid at the Office for Government Communications Affairs, said only social media sites were blocked but BBC News received conflicting reports from Ethiopian citizens who claimed that they experienced problems with both mobile networks and fixed line Internet services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40118378|title=Ethiopia blocks internet during exams|date=2017-06-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roughly 40% of schools in Ethiopia have computers. Of that 40% most of the schools are located in Ethiopia'a capital, Addis Ababa. This in turn has created a divide between schools in urban cities like Addis Ababa and schools in rural areas. Most schools that are connected to the Internet have limited access and only use it for email that's solely for administrators. Many universities and higher learning institutions in Ethiopia have computers but the average ratio of students to computer is about 10:1. Only 15% of private universities in Ethiopia participate in Electronic Distance Education which is also known as online school. For many students, online education is a more convenient alternative to pursuing higher education because of their location.&lt;ref name="Ethiopian"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/995541468256142802/pdf/463910BRI0Box31ia010ICTed0Survey111.pdf|title=ICT in Education in Ethiopia|last=Hare|first=Harry|date=June 2007|website=World Bank|access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two major initiatives aimed at bridging the digital divide gap. SchoolNet Ethiopia is a joint initiative between Ministry of Education and the United Nations Development Programme that has equipped 181 schools with 15 networked computer labs. The Distance Learning initiative backed by The Ministry of Education has been working with the Indira Gandhi National Open University in India to provide master's degrees to students from the University of Addis Adaba in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="Ethiopian" /&gt;

=== Effects ===
In a world almost completely reliant on technology and access to the internet, the [[digital divide]] in [[Ethiopia]] poses a major problem for its citizens and the effects are nearly detrimental in the current global economy. Without access to the internet, Ethiopia cannot compete with the rest of the world and this has caused many gradual effects. These include lack of education, continued economic depression, and a gross lack of transparency in the Ethiopian government, as well as many other smaller, trickle down effects.&amp;nbsp;

One of the greatest effects the digital divide has one Ethiopia is the lack of education. Approximately 39% of adult Ethiopians can read and a mere 55% of school aged children actually attend school full-time. With an essentially&amp;nbsp;non-existent public education system in this poverty stricken country, the current lack of digital access does not help this matter. An improved access to the internet could help better educate Ethiopian children and with decreased costs as well.

Another effect of the gross disparity in digital access is the economic impact on [[Economy of Ethiopia|Ethiopia's economy]]. Ethiopia is currently one of 19 remaining countries on earth without a true stock exchange. Without access to capital and investments, Ethiopia’s economy is growing at a snail pace of 5.4% in 2017. The digital divide plays a major factor in this because without access to technology the economy cannot keep up with the rest of the world. &amp;nbsp;

The [[Government of Ethiopia|Ethiopian government]] has a very well established reputation of being suppressive and corrupt throughout the world, and the digital divide also impact this. The few citizens with access to the internet who participate in the media are often heavily censored. With access to the internet, freedom of speech would be more easily accessible and less censored. The Ethiopian government would benefit from this because with more fair media coverage there would be less government corruption thus making Ethiopia a more stable country to invest in.

=== Gender ===
Ethiopian women experience more barriers to overcoming this digital divide than men, resulting in a gender gap. Many of these barriers are socially constructed through discriminating gender roles. Women's time and mobility are restricted by the expectation placed on them to bear the most household chores and management, keeping them too busy for educational or leisurely use of technology. Technological devices such as radios or movie showings are gendered as masculine tools and toys that are unfit for women. The restriction on time and mobility placed on women to work at home also cuts down on female participation in education, making them less comfortable with the idea of using computers and mobile phones because they believe themselves to not be educated enough to understand the devices or software. The risks of exploitation or exposure to pornography or harassment online also discourage the use of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cipesa.org/2017/03/gender-digital-divide-persists-in-africa/|title=Gender Digital Divide Persists in Africa|website=cipesa.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itidjournal.org/itid/article/viewFile/792/333|title=Earphones Are Not for Women: Gendered ICT Use Among Youths in Ethiopia and Malawi|last=Geldof|first=Marije|date=Winter 2011|website=|access-date=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SOAWR"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soawr.org/resources/women_and_ICTs.pdf|title=Bridging the Digital Gender Divide in Africa|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women could benefit from measures to increase their access to technology and close the digital divide between the genders. Access to technology and the internet would provide a wealth of information that is vital to entrepreneurship and practicing democracy. Policies and laws that discriminate against women and other social and political inequalities can be discussed and changed by allowing more effective means of communication and organization for those who fight for women's rights.&lt;ref name="SOAWR" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scidev.net/global/digital-divide/feature/ethiopia-gets-connected.html|title=Ethiopia gets connected|last=SciDev.Net|work=SciDev.Net|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/gaef3432.doc.htm|title=Closing Digital Divide Critical to Social, Economic Development, Delegates Say at Second Committee Debate on Information and Communications Technologies {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Digital Divide refers to the gap in exposure to technology needed to access the internet and online resources amongst a population. This gap leads to a decrease in the standard of living for those without access to technology while the standard of living for those who do have access to technology increases exponentially.&lt;ref name="PRCFrance"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Poushter|first1=Jacob|title=Not everyone in advanced economies is using social media|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/20/not-everyone-in-advanced-economies-is-using-social-media/|website=Pew Research Center|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global digital divide has been an issue for hundreds of years and is far from a new phenomenon. Currently, in most countries, the digital divide is becoming notably less wide due to an increase in availability of affordable electronic devices capable of accessing the internet and has led to an extraordinary increase in competition amongst technological markets. An increase in competition has resulted in increased exposure to new technology with internet access in even the lowest income areas. Despite the increased exposure to technology, there are still other elements of technological access that contribute to the gap. These disparities continue to contribute to the gap that divides nations and prevents historically underprivileged groups from meeting the societal standards that will allow them to thrive in current society.&lt;ref name=Renahy2008/&gt;

The three digital divides in France are characterized as generational, social and cultural differences, according to a report released by the Center for Strategic Analysis in the French government. The generational gap generally affects the elderly since they are the most unfamiliar with newer technologies. The social divide affects the poor since they are less likely to have the budget for technological devices. The cultural divide affects the least educated of the French since they have fewer opportunities for properly utilizing technology.&lt;ref name="LeMonde"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2011/04/20/un-rapport-decrit-les-trois-fosses-numeriques-en-france_1510566_651865.html|title=A report describes the three "digital divides" in France|last=Checola|first=Laurent|date=2011-04-20|website=LeMonde|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey released by the centre de recherche pour l'étude et l'observation des conditions de vie reported that 17% of the people in France do not have a home computer, 19% do not have any access to the internet, and 23% have no internet access at home. They also reported that only 1 in 3 people aged 70 or older can be considered internet users.

=== Internet Accessibility ===
In France, internet accessibility is not equally distributed among the entire population.&lt;ref name="PRCFrance" /&gt; Factors that determine internet accessibility in the French community are age, education, and income. Higher internet availability was found among French residents younger than 30 years of age, completed some level of higher education, and are currently employed or in school.&lt;ref name=Renahy2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Renahy|first1=Emilie|title=Health information seeking on the Internet: a double divide? Results from a representative survey in the Paris metropolitan area, France, 2005–2006|journal=BMC Public Health|date=21 February 2008|volume=8|issue=69|pages=1–10|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-8-69|url=https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1471-2458-8-69?site=bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Age ====
A decrease in internet accessibility correlates with increasing age in France. Those younger than 30 have been recorded to have the highest access to internet. French students retain the highest accessibility. After 30 years of age, accessibility declines. French 59 years and older retain the lowest internet accessibility.&lt;ref name=Renahy2008/&gt;

Less than 17% of people over the age of 75 have a computer at their home. In comparison, more than 90% of people aged 15 to 24 have a home computer. This is quite a large divide with senior citizens who make up about 20% of the population.&lt;ref name="LeMonde" /&gt;

==== Education ====
Higher education correlates to increasing internet accessibility. There is a sharp division between primary and secondary education. [[Secondary education]] graduates have four times the accessibility to internet versus those with only [[primary education]]. [[Post-secondary education]] degrees continue to show an exponential increase in internet accessibility.&lt;ref name=Renahy2008/&gt;

==== Income ====
Households with higher income levels reflect an increased internet accessibility. Residents with higher salaries are more likely to be able to afford internet connection. The trend persists between employed and unemployed residents. The employed population is 40% more likely to have access to internet.&lt;ref name=Renahy2008/&gt;

Of the individuals with lowest incomes in France only 34% have a home computer and only 28% have internet connection.  In contrast, 91% of the individuals with considerable wealth have a home computer and 87% have internet connection.&lt;ref name="LeMonde" /&gt;

=== Language ===
A language system is normally included in [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]]. Certain languages are more prominent in ICT's than others. Data collected in 2007 states that 45% of information on the internet is in English while 4.41% is in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaman|first=Ismail|date=2015|title=Digital divide within the context of language and foreign language teaching|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1877042815005753/1-s2.0-S1877042815005753-main.pdf?_tid=a8f35632-ce41-11e7-bc68-00000aab0f02&amp;acdnat=1511216886_ea6862754fae0ebcf7cc703a377d02bf|journal=Procedia- Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=176|pages=766–771|via=Elsevier science direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate study published by UNESCO in 2009 compared the amount of Wikipedia articles available per language. 2,259,431 articles (23.078%) were available in English and 629,004 articles (6.425%) were available in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Twelve years of measuring linguistic diversity in the Internet: balance and perspectives|last=Pimienta|first=Daniel|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|year=2009|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the total population in France, only 39% speak English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106183351/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-01-06|title=Wayback Machine|date=2016-01-06|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solutions ===
France has made significant impact on closing the digital divide.&lt;ref&gt;Schement, Jorge R., and Brent D. Ruben. Between Communication and Information. Vol. 4, Transaction Publ., 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Technological advancements and government funded programs have led to several innovative solutions and a narrowed gap between social classes within the nation regarding internet access and technological availability.&lt;ref name="Demunter, Christophe 2005"&gt;Demunter, Christophe. “The Digital Divide in Europe.” Statistics in Focus, 10 Dec. 2005, aei.pitt.edu/85501/1/2005.38.pdf?&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the French government began a program to curb the nation’s digital divide and starting offering a computer with high speed internet access to 1.2 million of its poorest citizens for just 1 euro a day. Mainly to ensure they would have access to the growing number of government services available online. Prime Minister Villepin announced the plan after a meeting of the interministerial committee for the Information Society. A similar project also launched in 2004 sought to put internet connected computers into the hands of university students, also for 1 euro a day, and between September 2004 and September 2005 the number of students with laptops rose from 8 to 22 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2657610/networking/france-picks-fight-with-digital-divide.html|title=France Picks a fight with the digital divide|last=Sayer|first=Peter|date=11 July 2006|website=www.Infoworld.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110064730/http://www.infoworld.com/article/2657610/networking/france-picks-fight-with-digital-divide.html|archive-date=2014-11-10|dead-url=no|access-date=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Center for Strategic Analysis released several recommendations for bridging the digital divide in 2011. Since many digital divides exist they have decided to take political actions to close the gaps. They also want to use public information campaigns to educate people.&lt;ref name="AuvF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.strategie.gouv.fr/cas/en/content/digital-divide-france.html|title=The Digital Divide in France|last=Auverlot|first=Dominique|last2=Hamelin|first2=Joel|date=|website=archives.strategie.gouv.fr|access-date=23 October 2017|last3=LeJeune|first3=Eugenia|last4=Rent|first4=Jean-Loup|last5=River|first5=Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt; For poor and uneducated households they will work to lower the costs associated with network access and also help with the cost of various types of devices for people to access those networks. There is an effort to try and better integrate older people into the digital society, by offering them assistance and education when it comes to participating in the digital society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.strategie.gouv.fr/cas/en/content/digital-divide-france-policy-brief-218.html|title=The Digital Divide in France Policy Brief 218|last=Auverlot|first=Dominique|last2=Hemelin|first2=Joel|date=18 April 2011|website=archives.strategie.gouv.fr|access-date=23 October 2017|last3=LeJeune|first3=Eugenia|last4=Rent|first4=Jean-Loup|last5=River|first5=Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will integrate the use of digital technologies in education to highlight good internet practices and to reduce the inequalities in schools. There is a push to showcase 'digital natives', which are those who were born into the digital world, adapting new social behaviors because of the way they integrate new interactive technology into their lives.&lt;ref name="AuvF" /&gt;

=== Minitel System ===
The Minitel System was one of France's earliest attempts to bridge the gap caused by the digital divide. The Minitel System, influenced greatly by the French government, was introduced in 1983 and "laid the groundwork for France's computerized future".&lt;ref name="Mailland, Julien 2017"&gt;Mailland, Julien, and Kevin Driscoll. “Minitel: The Online World France Built Before the Web.” IEEE Spectrum: Technology, Engineering, and Science News, 20 June 2017, spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/cyberspace/minitel-the-online-world-france-built-before-the-web.&lt;/ref&gt; The system provided French telephone users with access to online databases through their own personal phone line for no extra charge. The videotex service was accessed through a text-interface monitor and keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moulaison|first1=H.|date=2004|title=The Minitel and France's legacy of democratic information access|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X03000960?via%3Dihub|journal=Government Information Quarterly|volume=21|issue=1|pages=99–107|doi=|accessdate=24 October 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the system provided access only to things like phone books; however, in little time, users would be able to access numerous online services that allowed them to do things like view and pay bills and online shop. France Telecom made the service more user friendly, bundling users’ online purchases and telephone bills together. The Mintier System continued to grow and was able to provide access to "more than 20,000 online services before the World Wide Web even got off the ground".&lt;ref name="Mailland, Julien 2017"/&gt; By the end of the 1980s, "every adult living in France had access to the network". The system proved to be very successful and continued to provide online content to French phone users until its demise in 2012.&lt;ref name="Mailland, Julien 2017"/&gt;

=== Libraries ===
One in four European internet users access the internet only outside of their home; this means that 1/4 of the current European internet users would not have access to the internet at all if it weren't for places with free public access to the internet such as government funded programs like libraries.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Merklin, Denis. “Is the Library a Political Institution? French Libraries Today and the Social Conflict between Démocratie and République.” LibraryTrends, vol. 65, no. 2, 2016. Academic Search Complete.&lt;/ref&gt; The libraries of France are considered to be largely influenced by their political intentions to level the success and education levels amongst the social classes.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; These libraries are strategically placed in low income areas and on the outskirts of big cities where incomes tend to be lower and crime and unemployment rates tend to be higher.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Unlike the uNited States and comparable nations, French libraries have extended hours and are open on all days of the week.&lt;ref name="Demunter, Christophe 2005"/&gt; Librarians working in these facilities generally have an aspiration to help those of struggling communities enhance their education and learn to use new technology. These facilities have proven to be helpful in bridging the gap between high and low income social classes by exposing French citizens of low income areas to new technology, providing them with access to the internet, and thus lowering unemployment rates.&lt;ref&gt;

Germany's digital divide is impacted by several factors that include age, gender, family structure, education, ethnicity, and motivation. There are still areas in Germany that lack access to high-speed internet and large cities tend to have more access to the internet than rural communities. In 2006, the (N)Onliner Atlas recorded that only 51% of small rural communities (pop. &lt; 5,000) were Internet users, eleven points less than their urban counterparts in large cities (pop. &gt; 500,000), where Internet usage rates averaged 62%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schleife|first=Katrin|date=February 2007|title=Regional Versus Individual Aspects of the Digital Divide in Germany|url=http://www.zew.de/en/publikationen/regional-versus-individual-aspects-of-the-digital-divide-in-germany/|journal=ZEW Discussion Papers|volume=|pages=|via=Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital divide in [[Japan]] is the disparity of access to the Internet by the population of Japan. Multiple factors influence this divide. Cultural aspects of Japanese people contribute to the digital divide in the nation. Contributing cultural factors to the digital divide present in Japan are closing over time. Groups shown to be improving access include women and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2016|title=Japan Profile (Latest data available: 2016)|url=https://www.itu.int/net4/itu-d/icteye/CountryProfileReport.aspx?countryID=120|journal=International Telecommunication Union|volume=|pages=|via=International Telecommunication Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; 97.1% of the households in Japan have Internet access at home while 81% of the households in Japan have personal computers.

The 2015 population census of Japan was released,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stat.go.jp/english/info/news/20161227.htm|title=Statistics Bureau Home Page/News Bulletin December 27, 2016|website=www.stat.go.jp|language=en|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; under 15 years of age are about 16 mil  which is 12.6% of the total population. 76 mil of the population is the age 15–64 years of age which is 60.7% of the total population and 3.3mil are 65 years and higher are 26.6%.

===Cultural cause ===
According to the Japanese Statistics Bureau, MPHPA, and World Internet Project Japan, in 2001, 44% of the population was online, and 41% of that group were females. Additionally, figures point to declining disparity among internet access in various socioeconomic classes and gender. Additionally, figures show that younger Japanese individuals use the internet as compared to older Japanese individuals. All gaps are shown to be narrowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Wenhong|date=Summer 2004|title=The Global Digital Divide –Within and Between Countries|url=|journal=IT&amp;Society|volume=1|pages=18–25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study produced at the University of Buffalo shows that the Japanese consider advanced ICTs a common commodity, not as necessary for advancement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ubir.buffalo.edu/xmlui/handle/10477/46082]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippine Information Literacy website, which had an article based on a forum hosted by ASEAN and Japan about media and information literacy, held a two-day event that discussed “how the youth should cope with the rapidly growing world online—particularly the rise of social media—and how they could protect themselves from its hazards.” It also informed the audience about the advantages of technology and how telecommunications has taken over. 

===Population ===
Japan is divided into territorial divisions and depending on which geographic area that you live in, and everyone either has internet or no one has internet.

According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, there are a total of 39 “Zero Broadband Areas” in Japan. This is where there is no broadband access for even a single household within the district. This means Japanese citizens cannot get broadband even if they wanted to because there is no broadband infrastructure in their neighborhood. For some territorial divisions the coverage is up to 99.8% of the people in this area have access to broadband. This leads to a digital divide, but the divide is more drastic at the ends of the curve depending on where you{{Who|date=January 2018}} live.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is aiming to improve broadband penetration in remote areas of Japan, but businesses aren’t exactly queuing up to provide expensive infrastructure to hook up remote islands and mountain villages. Japan has more than 4000 islands, 260 of which are inhabited. Japan’s land is also 73% mountainous or hilly, and whilst the population is concentrated mainly in the alluvial plains and coastal areas, there are significant populations living in remote valleys deep in the mountains mainly engaged in agriculture or forestry. It is difficult to justify building out a fiber-based infrastructure to a remote island, or to a dead end mountain ravine community miles from anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fukumimi.wordpress.com/2006/06/28/the-digital-divide-in-japan/|title=The Digital Divide in Japan|date=28 June 2006|website=Wordpress.com|access-date=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible solutions ===
The internet users in Japan are increasing at an exponential rate but there are still areas demographically do not receive optimal broadband satellite [[communications in Japan]]. A possible solution for this is to launch more satellites for those areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017|title=Connection The Unconnected Working together to achieve connect 2020 Agenda Targets|url=http://broadbandcommission.org/Documents/ITU_discussion-paper_Davos2017.pdf|journal=International Telecommunication Union (ITU)|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally separated into categories of 58% female(most pronounced in [[Africa]], [[Arab states]] and [[Asia-Pacific]]), 60% rural,poor, illiterate and elderly are offline. [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] provides idea/plans for these focus groups to increase the amount of internet users. Rural areas need to implement a low-cost, given the lower household income is lower in these areas, another idea for rural areas is to provide public buildings with internet access.

=== Reasons for the Divide ===
Wealthier Mexicans are more likely than poorer Mexicans to have access to the internet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of certain dominant players monopolizing the [[telecommunication]] sector in Mexico, the majority of the Mexican population cannot afford the expensive services of television and internet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The digital divide is an issue for countries like [[Morocco]] who are trying to provide improved internet availability to its people. While internet is available to a majority of people in city centers, rural locations are still without access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oafrica.com/ict-policy/the-use-of-the-internet-in-morocco-measuring-the-new-digital-divide/|title=The use of the Internet in Morocco: measuring the second level digital divide|work=oAfrica|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exists some restrictions on [[telecommunication]] services and limited service providers to choose from. This acts as a block for Moroccan internet users because the lack of competition can become costly. The cost associated with internet services also prevents those who are more economically disadvantaged from accessing the same types of services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2016/morocco|title=Morocco|website=freedomhouse.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limitations to Internet Access ===
Some of the main limitations for access are education, gender, and age. People with lower education are less likely to access technology or further their professionalism in the [[information technology]] field. Moroccan women can often find that they do not have the same sort of opportunities to technology professions and internet usage. The [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) was formed to increase opportunities for women and a project called "Achieving E-Quality in the IT Sector in Morocco" has been set up for women to be presented with, increasing their professionalism. Ten universities currently participate in this project in an active effort to close the gender gap within the digital divide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|title=Bridging the Gender Digital Divide|url=https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/global/es_mx/assets/docs/netacadmktglibrary/globalgender.pdf|journal=Cisco Systems|volume=|pages=3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a discernible age gap between individuals who are active on [[social media]] and the internet and those who are not. Those aged 14–25 tend to be more familiar with the different social trends and access them much faster than the older generations. A large attribution to this is the lack of literacy in many adults. In 2010, 56%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.good.is/articles/morocco-women-girls-parents-literacy|title=Solving the Literacy Gender Gap in Morocco|last=|first=|date=|website=good.is|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Morocco's population was illiterate. While children able to go to school are learning to read, write and use various forms of technology; many of their parents do not have access to these same resources and may not have had access while they were growing up. The largest city of Morocco, [[Casablanca]], has a population of 3,544,498 as of 2016. Around 57.6% of the people throughout Morocco had access to the internet in 2016 while the rural population was 39.32%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS?locations=MA|title=Rural Population (% of total population)|last=|first=|date=|website=The World Bank|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a little over half of the population having access to internet many adults that lack literacy skills are currently living in rural areas with minimal access and usage of the internet, yet for their children they have the opportunity to occasionally access the internet through schooling.

=== Solutions ===
The government of Morocco has become increasingly involved in closing the digital divide being experienced by the country. Morocco lags behind in the digital world and steps are actively being taken to fix this. One plan that has been put in place is called “Maroc Numeric 2013”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lematin.ma/journal/2012/NTI_Strategie-de-Maroc-Numeric-2013--un-premier-bilan-globalement-positif/170317.html|title=Le Matin - «Stratégie de Maroc Numeric 2013 : un premier bilan globalement positif»|last=MATIN|first=, LE|work=Le Matin|access-date=2017-10-12|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan was initiated in 2013 in an attempt to get Morocco more involved in the digital world as well as provide some protections for internet users. This plan has the potential to boost the nation's [[Economy of Morocco|economy]] by creating jobs. The plans passed in government legislation also work to reduce some of the costs associated with internet connection and usage by ensuring that internet services can operate on a [[free market]] with little to no control unlike the newspapers and television stations of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.egov.ma/en/ict-infrastructure|title=ICT infrastructure|last=|first=|date=|website=gov.ma e-Government Program Kingdom of Morocco|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite efforts by the Moroccan government there is still some gap in digital connection among its people. The wealthier population still has higher internet access than those that are poorer. There has been some improvement with the help of free market [[Competition (economics)|competition]] to make access to the internet more readily available to all people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.psu.edu/northafricacomm410/2013/12/16/blogging-in-morocco/|title=Digital Divide In Morocco {{!}} North Africa - COMM410 Regional Focus|website=sites.psu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Samuel Lee, Fabian Seiderer and Lida Bteddini, one potential solution could be increasing and improving the lines of communication between the Moroccan government and it’s people who have expressed much interest in being involved with legal [[legislation]] and having more access to [[knowledge]] online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/07/25/digital-citizen-engagement-morocco/|title=The untapped potential of digital citizen engagement in Morocco: a data-driven approach to online participation.|date=2014-07-25|work=Impact of Social Sciences|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final solution might be updating the original plan, “Digital Morocco 2013” that was put in place in an attempt to bridge the digital divide. While the plan has led to some improvement, connectivity and usage of the internet is still limited to the more educated and [[Urban area|urban]] regions of the Moroccan kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2012/10/60931/morocco-digital-divide-persists/|title=Morocco digital divide persists|date=2012-10-14|work=Morocco World News|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Myanmar ==
{{see also|Internet in Myanmar}}

The digital divide in Myanmar is impacted by gender and economic class. Wealthy and powerful persons tend to have better access than those who are poor and men typically have more opportunities to get involved in the tele-infrastructure business. The tele-infrastructure in Myanmar is relatively weak compared to those in surrounding countries. The internet supply doesn't meet the increasing demand; hence the digital divide.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Economic issues===
[[Myanmar]] is a country with low income level and most internet access is on cellphones, because of the low simcard cost. The people who live above the poverty line have all kinds of modern-day access unlike the average or poor who struggle in the everyday necessities.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Invest in Myanmar|url=http://www.investinmyanmar.com/myanmar-tax-rates/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 it was recorded that 0.94 percent of Myanmar's population had cell phone subscriptions, due to low trade and economic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cellphone Subscriptions|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=wb-wdi&amp;met=it_net_user&amp;idim=country:MMR&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=burma+internet+penetration#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=it_cel_sets_p2&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:MMR:USA&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/new-private-companies-spark-mobile-phone-revolution-in-once-isolated-burma/2014/11/21/eb4479c2-6c41-11e4-bafd-6598192a448d_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people who live above the poverty line have all kinds of modern-day access unlike the average or poor who struggle in the everyday necessities.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; In 2016 Myanmar's [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) averaged $1,275.02 US dollars, which contrasts with that of the United States at an average of $57,466.79 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Myanmar GDP|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=MM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US GDP|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Myanmar internet demographics ===
The amount of internet users in Myanmar has increased significantly in the last few years. In 2014, there were 2 million internet users in Myanmar. That number, however, increased to 39 million users by 2016. The cause of this drastic increase in internet users was caused mainly by the massive increase in [[Subscriber identity module|SIM card]] sales recorded through May 2016. This combined with a more aggressive network roll-out by mobile providers to other regions, a decline in SIM card prices, the lowered prices of voice and data plans, and the lowered cost of mobile phones all led to this major increase in mobile sales and subscriptions over that two-year period. Because this market is beginning to reach its maturity stage, significant slowdown is predicted to occur by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/4500253015/Myanmar-internet-gets-boost-with-content-delivery-network|title=Myanmar internet gets boost with content delivery network|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.budde.com.au/Research/Myanmar-Burma-Telecoms-Mobile-Broadband-and-Digital-Media-Statistics-and-Analyses|title=Myanmar (Burma) - Telecoms, Mobile, Broadband and Digital Media - Statistics and Analyses - BuddeComm|website=www.budde.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender digital divide ===
Nearly 30% of women are less likely to have access to a mobile device in Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irex|first1=Irex|title=Ending the Gender Digital Divide in Myanmar|url=https://www.irex.org/sites/default/files/node/resource/overview-gender-digital-divide-myanmar-assessment.pdf|website=Irex.org|publisher=IREX|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cell phone is the main source of internet access in the country. Because of this deficit in internet access between the genders there is a Gender Digital Divide in Myanmar. There is also a significant wage gap between men and woman in addition to limited leadership positions available to be filled. Due to this woman are not as equally represented and often listed as a dependent. This gap contributes to the lack of resources, furthering the lack of digital activity for women. Currently Myanmar is working to close the gap by using more ICT’s in daily life in order to educate women.&amp;nbsp;However, due to the economic difference between to genders, women are less likely to have access to [[Information and communications technology|ICT’s]]. "IREX’s Tech Age Girls (TAG) program is addressing this gap in opportunity, providing more than 100 young women in Myanmar with the technology and leadership skills they need to achieve their goals and become agents of change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reich|first1=Mary Grace|title=How are tech-savvy girls in Myanmar closing the gender digital divide?|url=http://beyondaccess.net/2017/01/17/myanmar-gender-digital-divide/|website=Beyond Access|publisher=Beyond Access|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic Possibilities  ===

==== Rural areas vs. Cities   ====
The Nepal government usually focuses their resources on important necessities such as clean water, roads, and healthcare, as the country is still poor and developing and most of their population lives in rural parts of Nepal. People living in these rural areas are less likely to have access to technology, Internet, or phone lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abdelaal|first1=Abdelnasser|title=Social and Economic Effects of Community Wireless Networks and Infrastructures|date=2013|publisher=IGI Global|pages=57–58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMyeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=digital+divide+nepal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PKSqp5W8zA&amp;sig=kJPoR5zMzSQSMNHEOhLX-5RPI1g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi97by93P3WAhVQziYKHYLeB5s4ChDoAQhmMA0#v=onepage&amp;q=digital%20divide%20nepal&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jha|first1=Sudan|last2=Pandey|first2=Sunil|title=Digital Divide: Exploring National and International Approaches to Bridge the Digital Divide in the Perception of Developing Countries especially in the context of Nepal|journal=International Journal of Latest Trends in Engineering and Technology|volume=7|issue=3|page=373|url=https://www.ijltet.org/journal/147599137549.1067.pdf|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nepali is the national language of Nepal and is spoken by 44.6% of the Nepalese people. However, despite this, Nepal is home to 123 various languages. English is included in this and is spoken fluently at an estimated 2-10%.

== Pakistan ==
{{see also|Internet in Pakistan}}

Pakistan is one of the South Asian countries that does have internet access. Internet access in Pakistan began in the 1990s and has continued to grow over the past decades. In fact, Pakistan has about 32 million internet users. However, according to data collected by the World Bank, Pakistan has an overall population of about 193 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=PK|title=Population, total - Data|website=data.WorldBank.org|access-date=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Pakistan also has about 15 million people who access the internet from their mobile devices. Pakistan has 5 broadband internet providers and 10 DSL. Broadband use through computers is the number one way that people access the internet in Pakistan. The second most popular way that people of Pakistan access the internet is through their cellular devices. Even though there are about 32 million internet user compared to a large population, [[Internet in Pakistan#cite note-1|Internet in Pakistan]] is ranked 20th in the world.

===Cell phone coverage===
Pakistan has five major cell phone providers. The five are (in order from most to fewest subscribers): [[Jazz (mobile network)|Jazz]] 51.88 million; Telenor 39.37 million; Zong 27.71 million; Ufone 18.46 million; and Warid 12 million.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Recently in May 2017, the Pakistani government decided to lower tariffs and taxes on cellular services as well as on mobile phones. The reasons for this decision included years of pressure from the nation's top mobile operators and a [[World Bank]] report pointing out [[Pakistan]]'s high taxing of telecom services in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mobileworldlive.com/asia/asia-news/pakistan-to-cut-taxes-on-mobile-services-handsets/|title=Pakistan to cut taxes on mobile services, handsets - Mobile World Live|date=2017-05-29|work=Mobile World Live|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender and caste===
In rural Pakistan, cell service use is divided along gender lines. Karin Astrid Siegmann pointed out this disparity; 40 percent of female users have to ask permission from the male owners to make calls. Cell phones being in the hands of females is viewed unfavorably in Pakistani culture. According to one participant in the study, from the [[Muzaffargarh|Muzzafargarh]] district in rural Pakistan, "Women don't even know how to dial a number."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan038260.pdf|title=The Gender Digital Divide in Rural Pakistan: How wide is it &amp; how to bridge it?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the percentage of women owning a cell phone is 36% compared to men at 78% overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gallup.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Weekend-Read-42-Mobile-Phone-Usage-and-Access-in-Pakistan-by-Abdullah-Waqar-Tajwar2.pdf|title=Gallup Pakistan History Project's Weekend Read 42: Mobile Phone Usage and Access in Pakistan: An Analysis of Trends in 2015 and 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides gender, there is a distinct divide among [[caste]]s. Newer castes rank much more highly on the [[Digital Access Index]] (DAI) than do the older castes. The same study compared two political parties. One political party, called the [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf|PTI]] ([[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]]), was composed of newer castes [[Khan (caste)|(Khan]], [[Hashmi]], [[Alvi]], and [[Qureshi]]). The [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|Muslim League]] is composed of older castes. The PTI outperformed the Pakistan Muslim League in number of foreign visitors to its web site, with a combined percentage of 12.7%, and in websites linking to it with 450, compared to the Muslim League's 168 (See Table 6 page 354). Ahsan Abdullah elaborates the important background of these findings: "Members of the new caste traditionally have not been farmers; for example, members of the [[Sheikh caste|Sheikh]] caste are traditionally traders, and members of the [[Syed]] caste traditionally hold religious offices, and hence they have to be better educated as compared to the old caste members. The old caste members, who are traditionally farmers, require tacit knowledge more than education to be successful. This observation is supported by the higher literacy rate in new castes as compared to the old caste members, with [[Pathan]], Sheikh, and Syed being the top three educated castes among the 12 castes considered."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=15&amp;sid=a768fe68-af9d-44eb-af35-d77ac5d19ee3%40sessionmgr103|title=Digital Divide and Caste in Rural Pakistan|last=Abdullah|first=Ahsan|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230000000/http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid%3D15%26sid%3Da768fe68%2Daf9d%2D44eb%2Daf35%2Dd77ac5d19ee3%40sessionmgr103|archive-date=2016-12-30|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Private efforts, Public efforts put forth by the Pakistani government would help bridge the digital divide. There is an ambitious undertaking called the Universal Services Fund which would aim to provide broadband coverage to the whole nation by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/devel_e/a4t_e/s2_shah.pdf|title=National Perspectives on bridging the Digital Divide –&amp;nbsp;Permanent Mission of Pakistan to the WTO|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippines about 47 to 50% of the population can and has access to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogwatch.tv/2017/03/what-is-the-digital-divide/|title=What is the digital divide?|date=2017-03-22|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the Philippines only had BBS ([[Bulletin board system]]) access, however after March 29, 1994 the Philippine Network Foundation (PHNet) connected the country to the web via Sprint. As of 2010, 29.3 million Filipinos were using the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoeffel|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Rastogi|first2=Sonya|last3=Ouk Kim|first3=Myoung|last4=Shahid|first4=Hasan|title=The Asian Population: 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-11.pdf|website=Census Bureau|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russell|first1=Jon|title=Philippines named Social Networking Capital of the World|url=https://asiancorrespondent.com/2011/05/philippines-named-the-social-networking-capital-of-the-world-indonesia-malaysia-amongst-top-10/#pWievTJiqvEuvsd2.97|website=Asian Corresponded|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital divide is impacted by several factors that includes income and education. Jim-yong Kim, president of the World Bank Group, has stated that “We must continue to connect everyone and leave no one behind because the cost of lost opportunities is enormous. But for digital dividends to be widely shared among all parts of society, countries also need to improve their business climate, invest in people’s education and health, and promote good governance.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/millions-of-filipinos-suffer-the-social-injustice-of-digital-divide-world-bank-report/|title=Millions of Filipinos suffer the social injustice of digital divide: World Bank report {{!}} BusinessMirror|website=businessmirror.com.ph|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on politics and culture===
Based on Philippines government research, there is a noticeable rise of Internet use in the Philippines after it was first introduced on March 29, 1994.  “They were connected to the internet via [[SprintLink]]”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Internet in the Philippines|url=http://www.dict.gov.ph/the-history-of-internet-in-the-philippines/|website=GOVPH|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; this changed the Philippines culturally and politically. Social media is a leading motive for Internet use in the Philippines, but Internet use also plays a big part in their political communications.  The [[Philippine presidential election, 1998|Philippine presidential election of Estrada]] is where Internet use for politics started to take form.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karan|first1=Kavita|last2=Gimeno|first2=Jacques|last3=Tandoc|first3=Edson|title=Internet and Social Networking Sites in Election Campaigns: Gabriela Women’s Party in Philippines wins the 2007 Elections|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edson_Tandoc/publication/237373309_Internet_and_Social_Networking_Sites_in_Election_Campaigns_Gabriela_Women%27s_Party_in_Philippines_wins_the_2007_Elections/links/0deec53097c4145d06000000/Internet-and-Social-Networking-Sites-in-Election-Campaigns-Gabriela-Womens-Party-in-Philippines-wins-the-2007-Elections.pdf|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the protests, Filipinos used Internet to display charges against Estrada.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

=== Education ===
The Philippines was the only country in the Southeast Asia region that had a declining youth literacy rate between the years of 1990 and 2004, according to data from the United Nations. This prompted major school reforms and in 2012, a K-12 school curriculum was introduced which included a year of kindergarten and two senior school years. The Department of Education in the Philippines (DepEd) goal for students who graduate from the K-12 curriculum is for these students to understand technology works and how they can benefit from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Nick|title=Education in the Philippines|url=https://wenr.wes.org/2015/06/education-philippines|website=World Education News &amp; Reviews|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The curriculum of this program focuses on developing students to be comfortable with using computers and technology. Some examples are that in grade 4 students will learn how to use the basic functions of the computer, including the use of the internet and emailing, in safe ways. In grade 6, students will begin taking art classes to learn how to use technology for digital paintings and graphic designs. In grade 7, students will begin learning how to academically use the internet for journals and searching for academic sources for essays and other similar assignments. In the higher upper level grades, the curriculum will include schools that specialize in computer education as well as science and technology. The Philippines being able to close in on the technology gap after being so behind in the 90's and early 2000's is going to very much improve the graduation rate of the students now that they can study at home and use their sources to their advantage through tablets and computers instead of only being able to access their school work in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cruz|first1=Isagani|title=Technology in K to 12|url=http://www.philstar.com/education-and-home/2015/07/30/1482483/technology-k-12|website=philstar Global|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Saudi Arabia ==
The digital divide in Saudi Arabia is seen through their Internet usage statistics 47.5% of Saudi Arabians use the internet compared to 78.2% of the United States. Of the 47.5%, 83.87% of Saudi households use the internet and only 10% of these households have one internet user&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stats.gov.sa/sites/default/files/en-demographic-research-2016_2.pdf|title=Saudi Arabia Demographic Survey 2016|last=|first=|date=2016|website=General Authority for Statistics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Saudi Arabia, as of 2017, has 96% of women using the internet and 88% of men. In addition, both females and males use the internet almost equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/GenderDigital/SAUDIA_%20ARABIA.pdf|title=Responses to Questions related to "Report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on ways to bridge the Gender Divide from a human right perspective|last=Palais|first=Wilson|date=10 January 2017|website=The Permanent Mission of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== South Africa ==
{{Main|Digital divide in South Africa}}
South Africa's Digital Divide is being bridged by programs like Isifundo. This program provides computer literacy for South Africans who would otherwise not receive any training. They set up centers that provide access to computers and the internet. Their Facebook keeps people up to date with computer related news and other helpful programs in South Africa.

== South Korea ==
{{see also|Internet in South Korea}}
The digital divide in South Korea is mainly caused by the unevenness of economic, regional, physical, or social opportunities, leading to marginalized persons not receiving the benefits that technology can bring. The lack of adaptation to the [[informatization]] of social services, such as administration and welfare, results in limited opportunities for basic daily life and social participation. South Korea's information gap was initially due to economic reasons and the difference in the initial cost for using the Internet or PC, but recently there has been a gap between the users of the information according to the degree of utilization of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=정보격차(Digital Divide)|url=http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&amp;MAS_IDX=101013000769848|website=DooSan Dictionary|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the information society rapidly developed, the distribution of the Internet quickly accelerated in Korea, dividing people into two groups, people who are well adapted to the changes and those who are more familiar with the previous media. Although the percentage of local population with internet access is high in Korea, the average rate of internet usage is 99.9% for the young and 64.3% for the elderly.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Drawbacks of digital divide in Korea ===
[[File:GlobalBandwidthConcentration.jpg|thumb|450px |South Korea has become a more influential country with bandwidth.]]

As transiting society from industrial to de-industrial, information and knowledge can be substituted with capital and product in important social matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=탈공업사회(De-industrial society)|url=https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ED%83%88%EA%B3%B5%EC%97%85_%EC%82%AC%ED%9A%8C|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

However, the nature of information and knowledge, through [[commercialization]] process in [[capitalism]], could make a greater problem than supposition. So, information and knowledge is different from previous product( shoes, clothes, food so on) in that information and knowledge’s cyclic process from creating and application to extinction is most fast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=탈산업화 네이버 지식백과(De-industrialization on Naver 지식백과)|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1521470&amp;cid=42121&amp;categoryId=42121|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, those alteration in quantity and quality is unpredictable. From the nature of information and knowledge, those could make enormous social inequality(ex. class, state, sex, education, region etc.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=고|first1=영복|title=사회학사전(Sociology Dictionary)|url=http://book.naver.com/bookdb/book_detail.nhn?bid=36268|website=Naver Book|publisher=사회문화연구소|accessdate=30 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a global effect feature, one of the information and knowledge’s nature, can deepen global inequality and further sharpen the 2080 society, called [[Pareto principle|Pareto's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pareto's law on HanKyung Dictionary|url=http://dic.hankyung.com/apps/economy.view?seq=4941|accessdate=15 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reasons and correlating variables ===

==== Distribution of hardware ====
The most basic reason is the distribution of hardware. The most basic hardware in the information era is a computer, which creates an information gap between those who have difficulties buying a computer and those who do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital inequalities and why they matter on Taylor &amp; Francis Online|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1012532?journalCode=rics20|access-date=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the '2016 Information Gap Index and Survey' in South Korea, which conducted by the Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC) on 6,300 people nationwide, while only 53.2% of the underprivileged people have personal computer, the average proportion of whole people are nearly 83%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nia.or.kr/viewer/skin/doc.html?fn=a65cf074_3036_42ee_b74e_b10fd82dc456.pdf&amp;rs=/viewer/result//board/81623/|title=2016 Information Gap Index and Survey|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nia.or.kr|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer penetration rates are affected by many correlating variables such as region, education, and income and these variables can issue a complex impact. To overcome this difference, OLPC (One Laptop per child) is developing and also distributing $100 computer. In addition, a project for the free use of the internet such as the fund router project is in progress, but it is not widely available in Korea. As 'ubiquitous' becomes more and more popular, the distribution of small hardware is expected to grow even more and the digital divide is expected to deepen further.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=HanWoo|date=Summer 2007|title=The Digital Divide in South Korea|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan046433.pdf|journal=|volume=1|pages=8|via=journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Education ====
Education is the most relevant part of income in Korea.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|last1=SeHwan|first1=Bak|title=South Korea to offer more education support for low-income groups|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170731000890|website=the Korea Herald|publisher=the Korea Herald|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children whose lower income earners have less educational opportunities than higher incom earners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=C.Taylor|first1=Tess|title=The relationship between education and income on "lovetoknow"|url=http://jobs.lovetoknow.com/career-fields/relationship-between-education-income|website=lovetoknow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the children of low educated are more likely to be a low educated students than those of highly educated people, and this phenomenon leads to a vicious cycle of [[social inequality]].&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; Because the information era is built on [[capitalism]], this vicious circle is likely to lead to current society as well. Education is an important reason of digital divide.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tustin|first1=Rachel|title=Bridging the Digital Divide in Education|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/bridging-the-digital-divide-in-education.html|website=study.com|publisher=study.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without education on information society, it leads to poverty of information which causes to the economic discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexbeard|title=Addressing inequality in the digital era|url=http://www.alexbeard.org/wp/addressing-inequality-in-the-digital-era/|website=alexbeard.org|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of all, considering the characteristics of knowledge which is explosively expanding, if education can not keep up with the pace of the informational change, it can cause education gap to be more severe.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; In order to solve this problem, continuous education is much more required rather than shot term education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=carty|first1=winthrop|title=Public Education's Information Gap|url=https://nacla.org/article/public-educations-information-gap|website=nacla.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Digital divide in Thailand}}
{{see also|Internet in Thailand}}

Thailand's digital divide is impacted by its status as a [[developing country]] within [[Southeast Asia]] as well as several other factors that include income, choice of technologies, and socioeconomic factors.&lt;ref name="srinuan"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinuan|first=Chalita|last2=Erik|first2=Bohlin|date=2011|title=What makes people go on line?

== United States ==
{{Main|Digital divide in the United States}}

The digital divide in the United States has decreased since it was initially detected, however there are still portions of the country and certain groups that have limited or no access. Groups impacted by the digital divide can include certain income brackets, ethnicities, and the less educated. There is also a gap between rural and non-rural areas in America. Rural Americans have made large gains in adopting digital technology in recent years, but they remain less likely than nonrural adults to have home broadband, smartphones and other devices. This is not necessarily because of a financial issue, but because of the lack of access and the poor internet connection due to the lack of towers and phone lines. Mobile technology use among rural adults has risen rapidly, however they are still leaps and bounds behind Americans in larger cities that have more access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/06/26/america-internet-use-digital-divide-pew-research-center/29337085/|title=Digital divide decreasing but not gone|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, approximately 11.5% of the total U.S. population did not have internet access. Out of the 324,118,787 Americans, there were 286,942,362 total internet users (88.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/us/|title=U.S. Internet Users|website=www.internetlivestats.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vietnam ==
{{see also|Internet in Vietnam}}

The digital divide in [[Internet censorship in Vietnam|Vietnam]] stems from sociopolitical, economic, and technological issues, but over the last decade{{When|date=January 2018}} the country has made great strides in providing large-scale Internet access and more lax restrictions in order to bridge this gap. Though the majority of Vietnam is rural, more than half of the country's population has access to the Internet. Despite these limitations on technology, organizations around the world are working directly with the people of Vietnam to close the digital divide.

=== Internet demographics === 
Vietnam has a population of 96 million people, and 34.9%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/vm.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the population is urban. Despite this, 53%&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tuoitrenews.vn/society/39704/up-to-90-of-vietnamese-to-have-internet-access-it-official|title=Up to 90% of Vietnamese to have Internet access: IT official - Tuoi Tre News|last=|first=|date=23 February 2017|work=Tuoi Tre News|access-date=2017-10-17|language=vi-VN}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the country’s population currently has access to the Internet. According to a study conducted by market research company Statista&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/|title=• Statista - The Statistics Portal for Market Data, Market Research and Market Studies|website=www.Statista.com|access-date=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016, more than 91 percent of daily Internet users were between the ages of 25 and 34.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/348252/daily-internet-usage-age-group-vietnam/|title=Daily internet usage in Vietnam by age group 2016 {{!}} Statistic|last=|first=|date=|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the expansion in access, Internet quality remains poor in rural areas, and Vietnam ranks 16th&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; among other Asian countries with the most Internet users. Vietnam also has a slower average data transfer speed than neighbor countries. Compared to [[Singapore]]’s average of 16.5&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, Vietnam’s average is 5.0&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.akamai.com/us/en/about/our-thinking/state-of-the-internet-report/global-state-of-the-internet-connectivity-reports.jsp|title=Global State of the Internet Connectivity Reports {{!}} Akamai|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government censorship=== 
For individuals with access to the Internet, government censorship becomes another obstacle because the three Internet service providers in Vietnam (FPT Telecom,&lt;ref&gt;[https://fpt.com.vn/en/ Telecom]&lt;/ref&gt; Viet Nam Post and Telecommunications Corporation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vnpt.vn/Default.aspx?tabid=188 Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt; and Viettel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vietteltelecom.vn/|title=Viettel|website=ViettelTelecom.vn|access-date=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are owned by the government and military.&lt;ref name="FreedomHouse"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2016/vietnam#sdfootnote5sym|title=Vietnam|last=|first=|date=|website=freedomhouse.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnamese government restricts user access to websites that are critical of the government or feature politically sensitive content, as well as the websites of select human rights organizations.&lt;ref name="FreedomHouse" /&gt; In 2016, [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] were temporarily blocked in an effort by the government to crack down on social media due to rising unrest in [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]].&lt;ref name="mashV" /&gt; Hundreds of citizens protested in city streets regarding the government’s delayed response to an environmental disaster in which millions of dead fish washed ashore. It was believed by locals to be the fault of [[Formosa Plastics Corp|Formosa Plastics]].&lt;ref name="mashV"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mashable.com/2016/05/18/vietnam-blocks-facebook/#qTUYe.DUB5qw|title=Vietnam 'blocks' Facebook over the weekend due to protests over dead fish|last=Ho|first=Victoria|date=|work=Mashable|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increasing information and communication technology ===
In 2011, [[World Bank Group|The World Bank]] extended a project for an additional two years in an attempt to complete the process of installing software and conducting training. This [[technology]] and training would potentially allow for the expansion of small businesses, enhance current operating systems and disseminate information on a larger scale. Due to the slow Internet speeds in Vietnam, obtaining information was difficult. However, this attempt at closing the digital divide was unsuccessful and expensive, totaling 106.97 million US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.worldbank.org/P079344/vietnam-ict-development?lang=en&amp;tab=overview|title=Projects  : Vietnam - ICT Development&amp;nbsp;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;The World Bank|website=projects.worldbank.org|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this project was unsuccessful, organizations{{Who|date=January 2018}} are still working to solve the issue of the digital divide.

A '''diplomatic cable''', also known as a '''diplomatic telegram''' or '''embassy cable''', is a confidential text message exchanged between a [[diplomatic mission]], like an embassy or a consulate, and the [[Foreign minister|foreign ministry]] of its parent country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/29/10/1796-memos-us-embassy-manila-wikileaks-cablegate |title=1,796 memos from US embassy in Manila in WikiLeaks 'Cablegate' |date=29 November 2010 |accessdate=29 November 2010 |publisher=[[ABS–CBN Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Definition of "cable", {{cite book |title=The Macquarie Dictionary |edition=3rd |year=1997 |publisher=Macquarie Library |location=Australia |isbn=0-949757-89-6 |quote=(n.) 4. a telegram sent abroad, especially by submarine cable.

The term ''cable'' derives from the time when the medium for such communications was international [[submarine communications cable]]s. The term ''[[cablegram]]'' is also sometimes used. Due to the importance and sensitive nature of the subject matter, diplomatic cables are protected by the most elaborate security precautions to prevent unfettered access by the public, and unauthorised interception by foreign governments. They are always [[encryption|encrypted]], frequently by unbreakable [[one time pad]] ciphers using key material distributed using [[diplomatic courier]]s.

'''Drug nomenclature''' is the [[nomenclature|systematic naming]] of [[drug]]s, especially [[pharmaceutical drug]]s. In the majority of circumstances, drugs have 3 types of names: [[chemical nomenclature|chemical names]], the most important of which is the [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC name]]; [[trademark distinctiveness#Generic terms|generic or nonproprietary names]], the most important of which are the [[International Nonproprietary Name]]s (INNs); and trade names, which are [[brand|brand names]].&lt;ref name=UCB&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ucb.com/rd/info-centre/drug-naming | title = How drugs are named | publisher = [[UCB (company)|UCB]] | date = 2011-12-09 | accessdate = 2013-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generic names for drugs are nowadays constructed out of [[affix]]es and stems that classify the drugs into different categories and also separate drugs within categories.&lt;ref name=AMA&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-science/united-states-adopted-names-council/generic-drug-naming-explained.page | title = Generic naming | publisher = [[American Medical Association]] | accessdate = 2013-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A marketed drug might also have a company code or [[list of pharmaceutical compound number prefixes|compound code]].&lt;ref name=Pipeline&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2006/10/23/experimental_compound_codes | title = Experimental Compound Codes | date = 23 October 2006 | accessdate = 20 November 2015 | last = Lowe | first = Derek | publisher = Science | authorlink = Derek Lowe (chemist) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Chemical names===
The chemical names are the [[scientific name]]s, based on the [[molecular geometry|molecular structure]] of the drug. There are various systems of [[chemical nomenclature]] and thus various chemical names for any one substance. The most important is the [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC name]]. Chemical names are typically very long and too complex to be commonly used in referring to a drug in speech or in prose documents.&lt;ref name=UCB /&gt; For example, "1-(isopropylamino)-3-(1-naphthyloxy) propan-2-ol" is a chemical name for [[propranolol]]. Sometimes, a company that is developing a drug might give the drug a company code,&lt;ref name=Pipeline/&gt; which is used to identify the drug while it is in development. For example, CDP870 was [[UCB (company)|UCB]]’s company code for [[certolizumab pegol]]; UCB later chose "Cimzia" as its trade name.&lt;ref name=UCB /&gt; Many of these codes, although not all, have [[list of pharmaceutical compound number prefixes|prefixes that correspond to the company name]].

===Nonproprietary (generic) names===
During development, the company will apply for regulatory approval of the drug by the relevant national [[regulatory agency]] such as the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA); and it will apply for a generic (nonproprietary) name for that country, such as the [[United States Adopted Name]] (USAN) or [[Japanese Accepted Name]] (JAN). It will also apply for an [[International Nonproprietary Name]] (INN) through the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). 

Nowadays the national nonproprietary names are usually the same as the INN. The generic names usually indicate via their stems what drug class the drug belongs to.&lt;ref name=Merck&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/drugs/trade-name_and_generic_drugs/overview_of_generic_drugs_and_drug_naming.html | title = Overview of Generic Drugs and Drug Naming | publisher = [[Merck &amp; Co.]] | date = 2007-04-01 | accessdate = 2013-01-01 | last = Silverman | first = HM }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one can tell that [[aciclovir]] is an [[antiviral drug]] because its name ends in the ''-vir'' suffix.

====Combination drug products====
For combination drug products—those with 2 or more drugs combined into 1 [[dosage form]]—single nonproprietary names beginning with "co-" exist in both [[British Approved Name]] (BAN) form and in a formerly maintained [[United States Pharmacopeia|USP]] name called the pharmacy equivalent name (PEN). Otherwise the 2 names are simply both given, joined by hyphens or slashes. For example, suspensions combining [[trimethoprim]] and [[sulfamethoxazole]] are called either [[trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]] or co-trimoxazole. Similarly, [[co-codamol]] is [[codeine]]-[[acetaminophen]], and co-triamterzide is [[triamterene]]-[[hydrochlorothiazide]]. The USP ceased maintaining PENs, but the similar "co"-prefixed BANs are still current.

===Drug brands{{anchor|Trade names}}===
For drugs that make it all the way through development, testing, and regulatory acceptance, the [[pharmaceutical company]] then gives the drug a '''trade name''', which is a standard term in the pharmaceutical industry for a [[brand#Brand name|brand name]] or [[trademark]] name. For example, [[Lipitor]] is [[Pfizer]]'s trade name for [[atorvastatin]], a [[cholesterol]]-lowering medication. Also, Atocor is an Atorvastatin brand in India.

==Legal regulation==
Drug names are often subject to legal regulation, including approval for new drugs (to avoid confusion with existing drugs) and on packaging to establish clear rules about [[adulterant]]s and fraudulent or misleading labeling. A national [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]] is often designated to define drug names (and purity standards) for regulatory purposes. The legally approved names in various countries include:
* [[Australian Approved Name]]
* [[British Approved Name]]
* [[Dénomination Commune Française]] (France)
* [[Denominazione Comune Italiana]] (Italy, generic name)
* [[Japanese Accepted Name]]
* [[United States Adopted Name]]

The [[World Health Organization]] administers the [[international nonproprietary name]] list.

==Publication policies for nonproprietary and proprietary names==

In the [[scientific literature]], there is a set of strong conventions for drug nomenclature regarding the [[letter case]] and placement of nonproprietary and proprietary names, as follows: 
* Nonproprietary names begin in lowercase; trade names begin with a capital. 
* Unbiased mentions of a drug place the nonproprietary name first and follow it with the trade name in parentheses, if relevant (for example, "[[doxorubicin]] (Adriamycin)"). 
** This pattern is important for the scientific literature, where [[conflict of interest]] is disclosed or avoided. The authors reporting on a study are not endorsing any particular brand of drug. They will often state which brand was used, for methodologic validity (fully disclosing all details that might possibly affect [[reproducibility]]), but they do so in a way that makes clear the absence of endorsement.

For example, the 2015 [[American Society of Hematology]] (ASH) publication policies say,&lt;ref name="hematology_2015"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hematology.org/Annual-Meeting/Abstracts/3282.aspx | title=Information for Late-Breaking Abstract Authors | publisher=American Society of Hematology | date=2014 | accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Non-proprietary (generic/scientific) names should be used and should be lowercase."&lt;ref name="hematology_2015" /&gt; ... "[T]he first letter of the name of a proprietary drug should be capitalized."&lt;ref name="hematology_2015" /&gt; ... "If necessary, you may include a proprietary name in parentheses directly following the generic name after its first mention."&lt;ref name="hematology_2015" /&gt;

Valid exceptions to the general pattern occur when a nonproprietary name starts a sentence (and thus takes a capital), when a proprietary name has [[CamelCase|intercapping]] (for example, GoLYTELY, MiraLAX), or when [[Tall Man lettering|tall-man letters]] are used within nonproprietary names to prevent confusion of similar names (for example, predniSONE versus predniSOLONE).

==Generic naming systems and affixes==
The earliest roots of [[standardization]] of generic names for drugs began with [[pharmacopoeia#City pharmacopoeia|city pharmacopoeias]], such as the London, Edinburgh, Dublin, Hamburg, and Berlin Pharmacopoeias. The [[history of chemistry|fundamental advances in chemistry during the 19th century]] made that era the first time in which what we now call [[chemical nomenclature]], a huge profusion of names based on atoms, functional groups, and molecules, was necessary or conceivable. In the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th, city pharmacopoeias were unified into [[pharmacopoeia#National pharmacopoeia|national pharmacopoeias]] (such as the [[British Pharmacopoeia]], [[United States Pharmacopeia]], Pharmacopoeia Germanica (PhG or PG), Italian Pharmacopeia, and [[Japanese Pharmacopoeia]]) and [[formulary (pharmacy)|national formularies]] (such as the [[British National Formulary]], the [[Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary]], and the National Formulary of India). International pharmacopeias, such as the [[European Pharmacopoeia]] and the [[The International Pharmacopoeia|International Pharmacopoeia]] of the  [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), have been the next level.

In 1953 the WHO created the [[International Nonproprietary Name]] (INN) system, which issues INNs in various languages, including Latin, English, French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, and Arabic. Several countries also have national-level systems for creating generic drug names, including the [[British Approved Name]] (BAN) system, the Australian Approved Name (AAN) system, the [[United States Adopted Name]] (USAN) system (which is mostly the same as the [[United States Pharmacopeia]] (USP) system), and the [[Japanese Accepted Name]] (JAN) system. At least several of these national-level Approved Name/Adopted Name/Accepted Name systems were not created until the 1960s, after the INN system already existed. In the 21st century, increasing [[globalization]] is encouraging maximal rationalization for new generic names for drugs, and there is an increasing expectation that new USANs, BANs, and JANs will not differ from new INNs without special justification.

During the first half of the 20th century, generic names for drugs were often coined by [[contraction (grammar)|contracting]] the chemical names into fewer syllables. Such contraction was partially, informally, locally standardized, but it was not universally consistent. In the second half of the 20th century, the nomenclatural systems moved away from such contraction toward the present system of stems and affixes that show chemical relationships.

Generic names are used for a variety of reasons.  They provide a clear and unique identifier for active chemical substances, appearing on all drug labels, advertising, and other information about the substance. Relatedly, they help maintain clear differentiation between proprietary and nonproprietary aspects of reality, which people trying to sell proprietary things have an [[incentive]] to [[obfuscation|obfuscate]]; they help people [[apples and oranges|compare apples to apples]]. They are used in [[New Drug Application]]s for the US [[Food and Drug Administration]], in scientific descriptions of the chemical, in discussions of the chemical in the [[scientific literature]] and descriptions of [[clinical trial]]s.&lt;ref name = AMA/&gt;

[[Biopharmaceutical]]s have posed a challenge in nonproprietary naming because unlike smaller molecules made with [[total synthesis]] or [[semisynthesis]], there is less assurance of complete [[fungibility]] between products from different manufacturers. Somewhat like how [[wine]] may vary by [[strain (biology)|strain]] of yeast and year of grape harvest, each one can be subtly different because living organisms are an integral part of production. The WHO MedNet community continually works to augment its system for biopharmaceuticals to ensure continued fulfillment of the goals served by having nonproprietary names.&lt;ref name="who_inn_bio"&gt;{{Citation |author=World Health Organization |authorlink=World Health Organization |title=INN and Biologicals |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/services/inn/inn_bio/en/ |accessdate=2016-06-16 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years the development of the Biological Qualifier system has been an example.&lt;ref name="who_inn_bio"/&gt;

The [[prefix]]es and [[infix]]es have no pharmacological significance and are used to separate the drug from others in the same class. [[Suffix]]es or [[word stem|stems]] may be found in the middle or more often the end of the drug name, and normally suggest the action of the drug. Generic names often have suffixes that define what class the drug is.&lt;ref name=AMA /&gt;

==Example breakdown of a drug name==
If name of the drug solanezumab were to be broken down, it would be divided into two parts like this: solane-zumab. -Zumab is the suffix for humanized monoclonal antibody.&lt;ref name=EBSCO /&gt; Monoclonal antibodies by definition contain only a single antibody clone and have binding specificity for one particular epitope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piercenet.com/method/antibody-production-immunogen-preparation|title=Antibody Production (Immunogen Preparation)|website=www.piercenet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of solanezumab, the antibody is designed to bond to the [[Beta amyloid|amyloid-β]] [[peptide]]s which make up [[amyloid|protein plaques]] on the [[neuron]]s of people with [[Alzheimer's disease]].

==Pronunciation==
Most commonly, a nonproprietary drug name has one widely agreed pronunciation in each language. For example, ''[[doxorubicin]]'' is consistently {{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ɒ|k|s|oʊ-|ˈ|r|uː|b|ᵻ|s|ɪ|n}} in English.&lt;ref name="MW_Medical"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/medical/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OxfordDictionaries"&gt;{{Citation |author=Oxford Dictionaries |authorlink=OxfordDictionaries.com |title=Oxford Dictionaries Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade names almost always have one accepted pronunciation, because the sponsoring company who coined the name has an intended pronunciation for it.

However, it is also common for a nonproprietary drug name to have two pronunciation variants, or sometimes three. For example, for [[paracetamol]], both {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ær|ə|ˈ|s|iː|t|ə|m|ɒ|l}} and {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ær|ə|ˈ|s|ɛ|t|ə|m|ɒ|l}}&lt;ref name="OxfordDictionaries"/&gt; are common, and one [[medical dictionary]] gives {{IPAc-en|p|æ|ˌ|r|æ|s|ᵻ|ˈ|t|æ|m|ɒ|l}}.&lt;ref name="Dorlands"&gt;{{Citation |author=Elsevier |authorlink=Elsevier |title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |publisher=Elsevier |url=http://dorlands.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the variation comes from the fact that some stems and affixes have pronunciation variants. For example, the aforementioned third (and least common) pronunciation for ''[[paracetamol]]'' reflects the treatment of the ''[[acetyl|acet]]'' affix as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|s|ᵻ|t}} rather than {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|s|iː|t}} (both are accepted for ''[[acetyl]]''&lt;ref name="Dorlands"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MW_Medical"/&gt;). Other variations arise from the degree to which [[spelling pronunciation]] plays a role in individuals' use of the words. When variations interact in speech, it sometimes produces the familiar reaction of "[[Let's Call the Whole Thing Off|You say /təˈmeɪtoʊ/, I say /təˈmɑːtoʊ/]]." Nevertheless, accepted variants for drug names reflect plausibility regarding chemistry and pharmacy. For example, just as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɒ|m|ə|t|oʊ}} is not an accepted third option for ''tomato'', {{IPAc-en|f|ə|ˈ|n|ɒ|θ|i|ə|ˌ|z|iː|n}} is an implausible guess for ''[[phenothiazine]]'', given that ''[[wikt:pheno-|pheno-]]'' and ''[[thiazine]]'' are predictable (thus {{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|iː|n|oʊ-|ˈ|θ|aɪ|ə|z|iː|n}}).

The [[World Health Organization]] does not give suggested pronunciations for its [[International Nonproprietary Name|INNs]], but familiarity with the typical sounds and spellings of the stems and affixes often points to the widely accepted pronunciation of any given INN. For example, ''[[abciximab]]'' is predictably {{IPAc-en|æ|b|ˈ|s|ɪ|k|s|ᵻ|m|æ|b}}, because for INNs ending in ''[[Nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies#Substem for target|-ciximab]]'', the {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|k|s|ᵻ|m|æ|b}} sound is familiar. The [[United States Pharmacopeia]] gives suggested pronunciations for most [[United States Adopted Name|USANs]] in its ''USP Dictionary'', which is published in annual editions. [[Medical dictionary|Medical dictionaries]] give pronunciations of many drugs that are both commonly used and have been commercially available for a decade or more, although many newer drugs or less common drugs are not entered. Pharmacists also have access to pronunciations from various [[clinical decision support system]]s such as [[Lexi-comp]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4625">The '''European Social Movement''' ('''ESM''') was a [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] [[Europe]]-wide alliance set up in 1951 to promote [[pan-European nationalism]]. 

The ESM had its origins in the emergence of the [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI), which established contacts with like-minded smaller groups in Europe during the late 1940s, setting up European Study Center and publishing a magazine ''Europa Unita''.&lt;ref name=p568&gt;Tauber, p. 568&lt;/ref&gt; On the back of this work they organised a conference in [[Rome]] in 1950 which was attended by [[Oswald Mosley]], whose [[Union Movement]] was advocating closer European unity with its [[Europe a Nation]] policy, representatives of the [[Falange]], allies of [[Gaston-Armand Amaudruz]] and other leading figures from the [[far right]].&lt;ref name=p568/&gt; After submitting plans for a centrally organised Europe a second congress followed in 1951 at [[Malmö]], the home of [[Per Engdahl]], where it was agreed that the ESM would be set up as an alliance to this end. Engdahl was chosen as leader of a four-man council to head up the group, also featuring MSI leader [[Augusto De Marsanich]], [[French people|French]] writer [[Maurice Bardèche]] and [[German people|German]] activist [[Karl-Heinz Priester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Very deeply dyed in black: Sir Oswald Mosley and the resurrection of British fascism after 1945 |first=Graham |last=Macklin |publisher=I.B.Tauris |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-84511-284-4 |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Anders |last1=Widfeldt |title=A fourth phase of the extreme right?

The ESM suffered early setbacks however, arguing that a war against [[communism]] was, at least initially, impractical for a united Europe, whilst some delegates felt that [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racialism]] had not been sufficiently underlined as necessary for the new Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Tauber, p. 572&lt;/ref&gt; These problems proved particularly acute for some members of the French ''Comité National Français'', with leading members [[René Binet (neo-Fascist)|René Binet]] and Maurice Bardèche quitting both the French group and the ESM as a whole, before becoming instrumental in the formation of the [[New European Order]].&lt;ref&gt;Tauber, pp. 572-573&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing its activity despite the split, the ESM encountered difficulties in 1956 when a delegate was invited to the annual conference of the MSI. Following his attendance he recommended a total split from the MSI, whom he accused of being too preoccupied with [[Italy|Italian]] politics to be of use to [[pan-European identity|pan-Europeanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Tauber, p. 575&lt;/ref&gt; With divisions growing and competition from other movements biting the movement had largely become moribund by 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Tauber, p. 581&lt;/ref&gt; Its role was later taken over by the similar [[National Party of Europe]], which had many of the same members but was more formalised.

[[File:Panfleto da Frente Negra Brasileira.jpg|thumb|Frente Negra Brasileira Pamphlet]]
'''Frente Negra Brasileira''' (''Black Brazilian Front''), part of the [[Black Movement of Brazil]], was Brazil's first Black political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Jones-de Oliveira|first = Kimberly|date = 2003|title = The Politics of Culture or the Culture of Politics: Afro-Brazilian Mobilization, 1920-1968|url =|journal = Journal of Third World Studies|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in 1931 and active until the November 10, 1937 suspension of political parties by the then president, [[Getúlio Vargas]], the Frente mobilized Brazil's Afro-Descendant community for a project of racial equality. Desegregation campaigns and popular education focusing on literacy were just two of the ways the Frente engaged in activism.

The party was organized by Arlindo Veiga dos Santos following the [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930|Revolution of 1930]]. It was the first national organization of [[Afro-Brazilians]]. The party spread from [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] to most of the major states in Brazil including [[Minas Gerais]], [[Espírito Santo|Espirito Santo]], [[Bahia]], and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. A majority of the chapters were located in São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande do Sul. Many of the chapters were informal and lacked a connection to the main organization.

Frente Negra Brasileira was very active within the community and provided social gatherings and services as well as addressing the political concerns of its members. On December 17, 1931, in the first year of its existence, the Frente Negra Brasileira achieved one of its first success stories, the [[desegregation]] of public skating rinks. This was following protest by the group to police and threats of violence if the rinks were not shut down. As a political party, the Frente Negra Brasileira also would run candidates for political office, and although they never successfully put a candidate in office they were able to dramatically increase the number of registered voters before the [[Brazilian presidential election, 1934|1934 election]]. Outside of the political concerns addressed, Frente Negra Brasileira also provided services to its members including literacy and vocational classes, health clinics, jazz and [[samba]] bands, and legal services. On Sunday nights, the group would host a ''domingueira'' that was a meeting open to the public. These meetings would last roughly 4 hours and became a social gathering for members of the community. During these events, the first part was for business and the directors would speak about what was going on, but afterwards there was time for music and poetry.  Throughout their existence, the Frente Negra Brasileira published a newspaper, ''A Voz da Raça'' (The Voice of the Race), which provided news about black communities in Brazil and around the world.

The '''great grain robbery''' was the July 1972 purchase of 10 million [[ton]]s of United States [[grain]] (mainly [[wheat]] and [[corn]]) by the [[Soviet Union]] at [[subsidized]] prices, which resulted in higher grain prices in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Martha&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great American Grain Robbery &amp; Other Stories | last=Hamilton|first=Martha M.|year=1972|publisher=Agribusiness Accountability Project|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Grain Robbery |last=Trager |first=James |year=1975 |publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |isbn=0345241509 |pages=233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grain prices soon reached 125-year highs in Chicago. In a 10-month span, soybeans went from $3.31 to $12.90 a bushel. Food prices around the world rose 50% in 1973.&lt;!-- blacklisted link &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailyreckoning.com/the-great-grain-robbery/|title=The Great Grain Robbery - Daily Reckoning|date=August 9, 2010|publisher=|access-date=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; The U.S. government spent $300 million and by unwittingly{{Says who|date=July 2016}} subsidizing the Russian purchases, this event helped lead to the U.S. government seeking more information about global agricultural output via infrared satellite intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthzine.org/2015/10/28/the-great-grain-robbery-of-1972/|title=The ‘Great Grain Robbery’ of 1972|date=October 28, 2015|publisher=|access-date=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Great Grain Robbery'' is a pun referring to the "[[Great Gold Robbery|Great Train Robbery]]". Author [[Martha Hamilton]] introduced the term as the title of Chapter VII of her book ''The Great American Grain Robbery &amp; Other Tales'', as part of an allegation that the U.S. government was robbing American taxpayers in order to support grain trading companies.&lt;ref name=Martha /&gt; The terms ''Russian wheat deal'' and ''Soviet wheat deal'' fell into disuse since the sales included corn, barley and oats as well as wheat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5780">[[Image:HanochKali.jpg|thumb|right|Hanoch Kalai]]

'''Hanoch Kalai''' (March 13, 1910 – April 15, 1979) ({{lang-he-n|חנוך קלעי}}) was a member of [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], and an expert on the [[Hebrew]] language. He was ''Deputy Commander in Chief'' of Irgun under [[David Raziel]] and spent three months as ''Commander in Chief'' after Raziel was imprisoned by the British authorities, until his own arrest.

==Early life==
Kalai was born in [[Lithuania]], the son of Joseph and Pessia Strelitz. In 1924, the family moved to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], where family lived on Herzl Street in [[Kfar Saba]] and his father became a bank manager in the town. Following the [[1929 Palestine riots]], Kalai joined the [[Haganah]]. He was also a member of the [[Betar]] movement.

==Membership of Irgun==
On the final night of [[Passover]] in 1933, Betar members were attacked while parading in [[Tel Aviv]]. In retaliation, Kalai and [[Avraham Tehomi]] resigned from Haganah, and together they joined the Irgun. Kalai was appointed Irgun commander for Kfar Saba and [[Herzliya]]. During the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]], Kalai demanded an end to the policy of restraint and the beginning of reprisals against the Arabs.

Following Tehomi's split with Irgun and return to Hagana in 1937, Kalai was appointed commander of the newly formed [[Haifa]] district Irgun under [[Moshe Rosenberg]]. He was later appointed deputy commander of the Jerusalem district under [[David Raziel]]. During this period, Kalai also served as a broadcaster on the Irgun's underground radio station, [[Kol Tsion HaLokhemet]].

Kalai's three brothers were also members of Irgun and Betar. Mordechai Strelitz was an Irgun commander in Israel and abroad, and served as liaison between Irgun and Betar. Menachem Strelitz was a member of the Irgun in Kfar Saba, where he conducted experiments with weapons and explosives. He was killed at age 22 on July 17, 1936 when a grenade exploded in his hands in the family home. Mykhael Strelitz was arrested by the British and tortured. He never recovered from the experience.

===Leadership of Irgun===
Following Raziel's arrest on May 19, 1939, Kalai was appointed as ''Commander in Chief'' of the Irgun. At the first meeting he chaired, Kalai decided to act on two fronts: to continue retaliatory actions against the Arabs, and the commencement of operations against the British government following Parliament's approval of the [[White Paper of 1939]]. In following this policy, Irgun committed acts of sabotage against the infrastructure, including the post office and the government radio station in [[Jerusalem]]. Under Kalai's leadership, the group also assassinated the [[Palestine Police]] CID chief [[Ralph Cairns]], to end his harassment of Irgun and in revenge for his alleged torture of Irgun prisoners.

====First Arrest====
On August 31, 1939, the British arrested him with other key members of Irgun, including [[Avraham Stern]], during a command meeting in Tel Aviv. He was replaced as head of Irgun by [[Benjamin Zeroni]]. The detainees were transferred to the [[Jaffa]] police station, and then to the [[Tzrifin]] detention camp. Kalai and the other prisoners were released on June 18, 1940.

==Membership of Lehi==
Following his release, Kalai and Zeroni joined Avraham Stern who in July 1940 formed the [[Lehi (group)]], where Kalai wrote the new organization's manifesto. Kalai and Zeroni resigned from Lehi in late 1941 following Stern's attempts to form an alliance with [[Nazi Germany]] against the British.

===Second Arrest===
In January 1941, the British police posted a £1000 reward for his arrest, and on February 4, 1942 Kalai and Zeroni surrendered. According to Yehuda Lapidot, one of the reasons they surrendered is that no organization would help them, and they increasingly felt like hunted animals. By agreement with the British police, they were never tried, but instead were transferred directly to a detention camp. On October 19, 1944, Kalai was exiled to a Kenyan detention camp along with 250 other detainees, and returned to Israel only on July 12, 1948.

==Later life==
After Israel gained independence, Kalai became a language lecturer at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He was also an editor and translator to Hebrew from English, German and Yiddish, an editor at the Bialik Institute, a member of the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]], and the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]] plenum member responsible for Hebrew-language broadcasts. He translated [[Zorba the Greek]] into Hebrew, the first title in [[Am Oved]]'s People's Library imprint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/culture/arts-leisure/zorba-the-israeli-1.249353 Zorba the Israeli]&lt;/ref&gt; He also translated [[Virginia Woolf]]'s [[Flush: A Biography]].

Kalai was married to painter and sculptor [[Carmela Kalai]]. His son is noted academic [[Gil Kalai]].

Kalai died in 1979, and was buried on the [[Mount of Olives]] in Jerusalem. In 1999, the [[Jerusalem]] Municipality named a street after him in the Malha district of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/jer_sys/pro/rehovot/rehovot.asp?STREET_KOD=1336 Hanoch Kalai Street]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hazardous Material Emergency Alarm Systems (HMEAS)''' are stand-alone systems for protecting people from exposure to [[dangerous substance]]s in the workplace.

These systems are designed for a wide variety of commercial and industrial environments including [[Refining|refineries]], industrial processes and warehousing, educational and commercial research facilities as well as [[hospital]]s and even [[restaurant]]s.  The systems are designed to both alert and respond – activating warnings and alarms and depending on the extent of the danger, triggering corrective actions that could include material shutoffs, increased [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and the opening or closing of access to the exposed area.

'''Hazardous Material Emergency Alarm Systems (HMEAS)''' should be designed to meet the safety requirements embodied in the Building and Fire Codes used throughout North America and Europe,&lt;ref&gt;

'''Hellenization''' or '''Hellenisation''' is the historical spread of [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Ancient Greece#Culture|culture]], [[Hellenistic religion|religion]] and, to a lesser extent, language, over foreign peoples conquered by Greeks or brought into their [[sphere of influence]], particularly during the [[Hellenistic period]] following the campaigns of [[Alexander the Great]] in the fourth century BC. The result of Hellenization was that elements of Greek origin combined in various forms and degrees with local elements; these Greek influences spread from the [[Mediterranean basin]] as far east as modern-day [[Pakistan]]. In modern times, Hellenization has been associated with the adoption of modern Greek culture and the ethnic and cultural homogenization of Greece.&lt;ref name="Zacharia2008"&gt;{{harvnb|Zacharia|2008|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koliopoulos-Veremis"&gt;{{harvnb|Koliopoulos|Veremis|2002|pp=232–241}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The first known use of verb "to Hellenize" (ἑλληνίζειν) is by [[Thucydides]], who wrote that the Amphilochian [[Argos|Argives]] were linguistically Hellenized by the [[Ambracia|Ambraciots]].&lt;ref name=oup359&gt;{{harvnb|Hornblower|2014|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in [[2_Maccabees]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Maccabees|4:13|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Book of Acts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Acts|6:1|ESV}},{{Bibleverse|Acts|9:29|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise meaning is disputed but scholars believe the meaning of the word was not limited to "Greek-speaking".&lt;ref name=oup359 /&gt;

==Background==
[[File:MacedonEmpire.jpg|thumb|400px|Map of the Hellenized Macedonian Empire, established by the military conquests of Alexander the Great in 334–323 BC.]]
By the [[4th century BC|4th century]] BC the process of Hellenization had started in southwestern Anatolia's [[Lycia]], [[Caria]] and [[Pisidia]] regions. (1st century fortifications at Pelum in [[Galatia]], on Baş Dağ in [[Lycaonia]] and at [[Isaura]] are the only known Hellenistic-style structures in [[central Anatolia|central]] and [[eastern Anatolia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mitchell|1993|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When it was advantageous to do so, places like [[Side, Turkey|Side]] and [[Aspendos]] invented Greek-themed origin myths; an inscription published in [[Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum|SEG]] shows that in the 4th century BC Aspendos claimed ties to [[Argos]], similar to [[Nikokreon of Cyprus]] who also claimed Argive lineage. (Argos was home to the [[Kings of Macedon]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hornblower|1991|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hornblower|2014|p=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Argead]]s, the [[Antigonids]] claimed descent from [[Heracles]], the [[Seleucid]]s from [[Apollo]], and the [[Ptolemies]] from [[Dionysus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Patterson|2010|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seuthopolis inscription BG.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.5|The Seuthopolis inscription]]
The [[Seuthopolis inscription]] was very influential in the modern [[Thracology|study of Thrace]]. The inscription mentions [[Dionysus]], [[Apollo]] and some [[Samothrace|Samothracian gods]]. Scholars have interpreted the inscription as evidence of Hellenization in inland Thrace during the early Hellenisitc, but this has been challenged by recent scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hellenization, however, had its limitations. For example, areas of southern [[Syria]] that were affected by Greek culture entailed mostly [[Seleucid]] urban centres, where [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] was commonly spoken. The countryside, on the other hand, was largely unaffected, with most of its inhabitants speaking [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and clinging to their native traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|Grenet|1975|p=353}}: "South Syria was thus a comparatively late addition to the Seleucid empire, whose heartland was North Syria. Here Seleucus himself created four cities—his capital of Antiochia-on-the-Orontes, and Apamea, Seleucia and Laodicia—all new foundations with a European citizen body. Twelve other Hellenistic cities are known there, and the [[Seleucid army]] was largely based in this region, either garrisoning its towns or settled as reservists in military colonies. Hellenisation, although intensive, seems in the main to have been confined to these urban centers, where Greek was commonly spoken. The country people appear to have been little affected by the cultural change, and continued to speak Syriac and to follow their traditional ways. Despite its political importance, little is known of Syria under Macedonian rule, and even the process of Hellenisation is mainly to be traced in the one community which has preserved some records from this time, namely the Jews of South Syria."&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological evidence alone gives only an incomplete picture of Hellenization; it is often not possible to state with certainty whether particular archaeological findings belonged to Greeks, Hellenized indigenous peoples, indigenous people who simply owned Greek-style objects or some combination of these groups. Thus, literary sources are also used to help researchers interpret archaeological findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|Hammond|1982|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern times===
{{main|Geographical name changes in Greece}}
{{see also|Grecomans}}
In 1909, a commission appointed by the Greek government reported that a third of the villages of [[Greece]] should have their names changed, often because of their non-Greek origin.&lt;ref name="Zacharia2008"/&gt; In other instances, names were changed from a contemporary name of Greek origin to the ancient Greek name. Some village names were formed from a Greek root word with a foreign suffix or vice versa. Most of the name changes took place in areas populated by ethnic Greeks in which a strata of foreign or divergent toponyms had accumulated over the centuries. However, in some parts of northern Greece, the population was not Greek-speaking, and many of the former toponyms had reflected the diverse ethnic and linguistic origins of their inhabitants.

The process of the change of toponyms in modern Greece has been described as a process of Hellenization.&lt;ref name="Zacharia2008"/&gt; A modern use is in connection with policies pursuing "cultural harmonization and education of the linguistic minorities resident within the modern Greek state" ([[the Hellenic Republic]]): the Hellenization of minority groups in modern Greece.&lt;ref name="Koliopoulos-Veremis"/&gt; The term Hellenisation (or Hellenization) is also used in the context of Greek opposition to the use of the [[Macedonian language]] in the Greek province of Macedonia&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, the Greek government abolished all Italian schools in the [[Ionian islands]], which had been annexed to Greece six years earlier. That led to the diminution of the community of [[Corfiot Italians]], which had lived in [[Corfu]] since the Middle Ages; by the 1940s, there were only 400 Corfiot Italians left.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Giulio|2000|p=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regions==
Hellenization reached [[Pisidia]] and [[Lycia]] sometime in the [[4th century BC]], but the interior remained largely unaffected for several more centuries until it came under Roman rule in the [[1st century BC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hornblower|2014|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ionia]]n, [[Aeolians|Aeolian]] and [[Dorians|Doric]] settlers along Anatolia's Western coast seemed to have remained culturally Greek and some of their [[city-states]] date back to the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Period]]. On the other hand, Greeks who settled in the southwestern region of Pisidia and Pamphylia seem to have been assimilated by the local culture.&lt;ref name=mitchell&gt;{{harvnb|Mitchell|1991|pp=119–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crimea===
{{Main|Bosporan Kingdom}}
[[Panticapaeum]] (modern day [[Kerch]]) was one of the [[Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|early Greek colonies in Crimea]]. It was founded by [[Miletus]] around 600 BC on a site with good terrain for a defensive [[acropolis]]. By the time the [[Cimmerian]] colonies had organized into the [[Bosporan Kingdom]] around  much of the local native population had been Hellenized.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|Hammond|1982|pp=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars date the establishment of the kingdom to 480 BC, when the [[Archaeanactid dynasty]]  assumed control of Panticapaeum, but classical archaeologist [[Gocha R. Tsetskhladze]] has dated the kingdom's founding to 436 BC, when the [[Spartocid dynasty]] replaced the ruling Archaeanactids.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsetskhladze|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
{{main|Hellenistic Judaism}}

The Hellenistic [[Seleucid]] and [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] kingdoms that formed after Alexander's death were particularly relevant to the history of [[Judaism]]. Located between the two kingdoms, Israel experienced long periods of warfare and instability. [[Judea]] fell under Seleucid control in 198 BC. By the time  [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] became king of Judea in 175 BC, [[Jerusalem]] was already somewhat Hellenized. In 170 BC, both claimants to the High Priesthood, [[Jason (high priest)|Jason]] and [[Menelaus (High Priest)|Menelaus]], bore Greek names. Jason had established institutions of [[ephebos|Greek education]] and in later years Jewish culture started to be suppressed including forbidding circumcision and observance of the [[Sabbath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|2012|pp=55–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hellenization of members of the Jewish elite included names, clothes but other customs were adapted by the rabbis and elements that violated the [[halakha]] and [[midrash]] were prohibited. One example is the elimination of some aspects of Hellenistic banquets such as the practice of offering [[libations]] to the gods, while incorporating certain elements that gave the meals a more Jewish character. Discussion of [[Scripture]], the singing of sacred songs and attendance of students of the [[Torah]] was encouraged. One detailed account of Jewish-style Hellenistic banquets comes from [[Ben Sira]]. There is literary evidence from [[Philo]] about the extravagance of Alexandrian Jewish banquets and ''The Letter of Aristeas'' discusses Jews dining with non-Jews as an opportunity to share Jewish wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shimoff|1996|pp=440–452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parthia===
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
[[File:Sarbaz Nysa.jpg|thumb|120px|Head of a statue of a [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] wearing a Hellenistic helmet from [[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nisa]]. The Parthians adopted both [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] and Hellenistic cultures.]]

===Pisidia and Pamphylia===
Pamphylia is a plain located between the [[highlands]] of [[Lycia]] and [[Cilicia]]. The exact date of Greek settlement in the region is not known; one possible theory is that settlers arrived in the region as part of [[Bronze Age]] [[maritime trade]] between the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], [[Levant]] and [[Cyprus]], while another attributes it to population movements during the instability of the [[Bronze Age Collapse]]. The Greek dialect established in [[Pamphylia]] by the Classical period was related to [[Arcado-Cypriot]].&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2013|p=532}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mopsus]] is a legendary founder of several coastal cities in southwestern Anatolia, including [[Aspendos]], [[Phaselis]], [[Perge]] and [[Sillyon]].&lt;ref name=wilson /&gt;&lt;ref name=stoneman&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bilingual [[Phoenecian]] and [[neo-Hittite]] [[Luwian]] inscription found at [[Karatepe]], dated to 800 BC, says that the ruling dynasty there traced their origins to [[Mopsus]].&lt;ref name=mitchell /&gt;&lt;ref name=wilson /&gt; Mopsus, whose name is also attested to in [[Hittites|Hittite]] documents, may originally have been an Anatolian figure that became part of the cultural traditions of Pamphylia's early Greek settlers.&lt;ref name=wilson /&gt; Attested to in [[Linear B]] texts, he is given a Greek genealogy as a descendent of [[Manto (mythology)|Manto]] and [[Apollo]].&lt;ref name=stoneman /&gt;

For centuries the indigenous population exerted considerable influence on Greek settlers, but after the 4th century BC this population quickly started to become Hellenized.&lt;ref name=mitchell /&gt;  Very little is known about Pisidia prior to the [[3rd century BC|3rd century]], but there is quite a bit of archeological evidence that dates to the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref name=survey /&gt; Literary evidence, however, including inscriptions and coins are limited.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; During the 3rd and 2nd centuries, native regional tongues were abandoned in favor of [[koine Greek]] and settlements began to take on characteristics of Greek ''[[polis]]''.&lt;ref name=mitchell /&gt;&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{harvnb|Mitchell|2013|pp=97–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Iron Age]] Panemoteichos I may be an early precursor to later regional Hellenistic settlements including [[Selge]], [[Termessos]] and [[Sagalssos]] (believed to be the three most prominent cities of Hellenistic Pisidia).&lt;ref name=mitchell /&gt;&lt;ref name=survey /&gt; The site is evidence of "urban organization" that predates the Greek ''[[polis]]'' by 500 years. Based on Panemoteichos I and other Iron Age sites, including the [[Phrygian Valley|Phrygian]] [[Midas şehri]] and the [[Cappadocian]] fortification of [[Kerkenes]], experts believe that "behind the Greek influence that shaped the Hellenistic Pisidian communities there lay a tangible and important Anatolian tradition."&lt;ref name=survey /&gt; 

According to the writings of [[Arrian]] the population of [[Side, Turkey|Side]], who traced their origins to [[Aeolians|Aeolian]] [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Cyme]], had forgotten the Greek language by the time Alexander arrived at the city in 334 BC. There are [[Numismatic|coins]] and stone inscriptions that attest to a unique script from the region but the language has only been partially deciphered.&lt;ref name=wilson /&gt;&lt;ref name=mitchell /&gt;

===Phrygia===
The latest dateable coins found at the Phrygian capital of [[Gordion]] are from the 2nd century BC. Finds from the abandoned Hellenistic era settlement include imported and locally-produced imitation Greek-style [[terracotta]] figurines and ceramics. Inscriptions show that some of the inhabitants had Greek names, while others had Anatolian or possibly [[Celts|Celtic]] names.&lt;ref name=kealhofer&gt;{{Cite book

Many [[Phrygia]]n cult objects were Hellenized during the Hellenistic period, but worship of traditional deities like the Phrygian mother goddess persisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roller|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek cults attested to include [[Hermes]], [[Kybele]], the [[Muses]] and [[Tyche]].&lt;ref name=kealhofer /&gt;

===Syria===
Greek art and culture reached [[Phoenicia under Hellenistic rule|Phoenicia]] by way of commerce before any Greek cities were founded in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1940|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Hellenization of Syrians in not widespread until it becomes a [[Roman Syria|Roman province]] . Under Roman rule in the 1st century BC there is evidence of Hellenistic style funerary architecture, decorative elements, mythological references, and inscriptions. However, there is a lack of evidence from Hellenistic Syria; concerning this most scholars view it as a case of "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jong|2017|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

===Bactria===
The [[Bactrians]], an Iranian ethnic group who lived in [[Bactria]] (northern [[Afghanistan]]), were Hellenized during the reign of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] and soon after various tribes in northwestern regions of the [[Indian subcontinent]] underwent Hellenization during the reign of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]].

==Early Christianity==
The [[periodization]] of the [[Hellenistic Age]], between the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] up to [[Octavian]]{{'}}s victory at the [[Battle of Actium]], has been attributed to the 19th-century historian [[J. G. Droysen]]. According to this model the spread of Greek culture spread during this period made the rise of [[Christianity]] possible. Later, in the 20th century, scholars questioned this 19th-century [[paradigm]] for failing to account for the contributions of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and other [[Near Eastern]] cultures.&lt;ref name=oup359 /&gt; 

The twentieth century witnessed a lively debate over the extent of Hellenization in the [[Levant]], particularly among the ancient [[Jews]], which has continued until today. Interpretations on the rise of [[Early Christianity]], which was applied most famously by [[Rudolf Bultmann]], used to see [[Judaism]] as largely unaffected by Hellenism, and the Judaism of the diaspora was thought to have succumbed thoroughly to its influences. Bultmann thus argued that Christianity arose almost completely within those Hellenistic confines and should be read against that background, as opposed to a more traditional Jewish background. With the publication of [[Martin Hengel]]'s two-volume study ''Hellenism and Judaism'' (1974, German original 1972) and subsequent studies ''Jews, Greeks and Barbarians: Aspects of the Hellenisation of Judaism in the pre-Christian Period'' (1980, German original 1976) and ''The 'Hellenisation' of Judaea in the First Century after Christ'' (1989, German original 1989), the tide began to turn decisively. Hengel argued that virtually all of Judaism was highly Hellenized well before the beginning of the Christian era, and even the Greek language was well-known throughout the cities and even the smaller towns of Jewish Palestine. Scholars have continued to nuance Hengel's views, but almost all believe that strong Hellenistic influences were throughout the Levant, even among the conservative Jewish communities, which were the most nationalistic.

In his introduction to the 1964 book ''[[Meditations]]'', Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth discussed the profound influence of [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]] on Christianity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Again in the doctrine of the Trinity, the ecclesiastical conception of Father, Word, and Spirit finds its germ in the different Stoic names of the Divine Unity. Thus [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], writing of the supreme Power which shapes the universe, states, 'This Power we sometimes call the All-ruling God, sometimes the incorporeal Wisdom, sometimes the holy Spirit, sometimes Destiny.' The Church had only to reject the last of these terms to arrive at its own acceptable definition of the Divine Nature; while the further assertion 'these three are One', which the modern mind finds paradoxical, was no more than commonplace to those familiar with Stoic notions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The {{nihongo|'''High Treason Incident'''|大逆事件|Taigyaku Jiken}}, also known as the {{nihongo|'''Kōtoku Incident'''|幸徳事件|Kōtoku Jiken}}, was a [[socialist]]-[[anarchist]] plot to assassinate the Japanese [[Emperor Meiji]] in 1910, leading to a [[mass arrest]] of leftists, and the execution of 12 alleged conspirators in 1911.&lt;ref name="Nishcortazzi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nish |first=Ian Hill |author2=Cortazzi, Hugh |title=Britain &amp; Japan: Biographical Portraits |publisher=Japan Society Publications |year=2002 |pages=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
On 20 May 1910, the police searched the room of Miyashita Takichi (1875–1911), a young lumbermill employee in [[Nagano Prefecture]], and found materials which could be used to construct bombs. Investigating further, the police arrested his accomplices, Nitta Tōru (1880–1911), Niimura Tadao (1887–1911), Furukawa Rikisaku (1884–1911) and [[Kōtoku Shūsui]] and his former common-law wife, [[feminist]] author [[Kanno Suga]]. Upon questioning, the police discovered what the prosecutor's office regarded as a nationwide conspiracy against the Japanese monarchy.

In the subsequent investigation, many known leftists and suspected sympathizers were brought in for questioning around the country. Eventually, 25 men and one woman were brought to trial on the charge of violation of Article 73 of the Criminal Code (harming or intending harm to the Emperor or member of the imperial family). Four of those arrested were Buddhist monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Victoria |first=Brian  |title=Zen at War |publisher=Weatherhill, Inc. |year=1997 |pages=38}} &lt;/ref&gt;  The case was tried in a closed court, and the [[prosecutor]] was [[Hiranuma Kiichirō]].

Evidence against the defendants was mainly [[circumstantial evidence|circumstantial]]. Nonetheless, twenty-four of the twenty-six defendants were [[death sentence|sentenced to death]] by [[hanging]] on 18 January 1911, and the remaining two defendants were sentenced to 8 years and 11 years respectively for violation of explosives ordinances.   

Of the death sentences, an Imperial Rescript commuted twelve to [[life imprisonment]] on the following day.  Of the remaining twelve, eleven were executed on 24 January 1911. These included Shūsui,&lt;ref name="Nishcortazzi"/&gt; a prominent Japanese anarchist, Ōishi Seinosuke, a doctor, and [[Uchiyama Gudō]], the only one of the Buddhist priests arrested to be executed.  The last of the condemned defendants, the only woman, [[Kanno Sugako|Kanno]], was executed the next day.

The case was largely used as a pretext by authorities to round up dissidents. Only five or six of those accused and convicted in the trial actually had anything to do with the plot to kill the emperor.  Even the foremost defendant, Shūsui, had not been involved in the plot since the very earliest stages, but his high prestige made him the principal figure to the prosecution.

The High Treason Incident is indirectly related to The [[Red Flag Incident]] of 1908. During the High Treason investigation, anarchists already incarcerated were questioned about possible involvement, including [[Ōsugi Sakae]], [[Sakai Toshihiko]], and Yamakawa Hitoshi.  Being already in jail saved many from facing further charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowen Raddeker |first=Helen |title=Treacherous Women of Imperial Japan |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanno, who was found not guilty during the Red Flag trials, was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death in the High Treason trials.

==Aftermath==
The High Treason Incident created a shift in the intellectual environment of the late [[Meiji period]] towards more control and heightened repression for ideologies deemed potentially subversive. It is often cited as one of the factors leading to the promulgation of the [[Peace Preservation Law]]s.

A plea for a retrial was submitted after the end of the Second World War but this was turned down by the Supreme Court in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members2.jcom.home.ne.jp/anarchism/koutoku-giken.html |script-title=ja:幸徳事件 |language=Japanese |accessdate=2011-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606124643/http://members2.jcom.home.ne.jp/anarchism/koutoku-giken.html |archivedate=June 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was established in 1928 by the Sixth [[Pan-American Conference]] and is composed of one female representative from each Republic in the Union. It was continued in 1933 and in 1938 was made a permanent organization, with the goal of studying and addressing women’s issues in the Americas.&lt;ref name="Inter-American Commission of women"&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Rights Part A|url=http://biblio-archive.unog.ch/dateien/2/d13629.pdf|website=biblio-archive.unog|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=13 July 2015|location=New York|page=59|date=29 February 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first intergovernmental organization designed specifically to address the civil and political needs of women.&lt;ref name="Jain (2005)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Devaki|title=Women, Development, and the UN a Sixty-Year Quest for Equality and Justice.|date=2005|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0-253-11184-5|page=15|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=sQjqWx0ZgekC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first international organization ever to present a resolution for international suffrage for women in 1933. It was the first organization to submit a treaty which was adopted concerning women's rights—the 1933 Convention on the Nationality of Women, which provided that marriage did not affect nationality. The women of the CIM submitted a resolution and attained the first international acknowledgement of women's political and civil rights (1938). They also researched and prepared the first ever resolution on violence against women which was approved as the 1994 [[Convention of Belém do Pará]]. These firsts were based upon a strategy that has been followed by the women delegates of the CIM. By attaining international agreements, they are able to pressure change in their home countries to comply with those resolutions.

==History==
===Founding===
When it became known that one of the three topics to be discussed at the 1930 meeting of the [[League of Nations]] would be the subject of nationality and how that could be codified in international law, [[Doris Stevens]],&lt;ref name="Lee (1929)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Muna |title=The Inter-American Commission of Women |journal=Pan-American Magazine |date=October 1929 |page=1 |url=http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/surgery/IACW.pdf |accessdate=13 July 2015 |postscript=;}} contained in {{cite book |editor1-last=Cohen |editor1-first=Jonathan |title=A Pan-American Life: Selected Poetry and Prose of Muna Lee |date=2004 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison, Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt; a well-known feminist from the United States&lt;ref name="Lee (1929), p 5"&gt;"Lee (1929)", p 5&lt;/ref&gt; determined that the first priority of [[feminists]] should be to study how law effected women's nationality. For example, at the time, upon marrying, a British woman would have lost her British citizenship had she married an Argentine, but as Argentina's law did not confer citizenship upon her for marriage, she became stateless. Stevens worked with [[Alice Paul]] of the [[National Woman's Party]] of the United States to review and prepare a report evaluating how women were effected by various laws. The women compiled a monumental report, which indexed all laws controlling women's nationality from every country in their native language and then translated each law on an accompanying page.&lt;ref name="Lee (1929)" /&gt;

Stevens spent three months in Europe meeting with women leaders and compiling information. She met with Dr. [[Luisa Baralt]] of Havana, Dr. [[Ellen Gleditsch]] of Oslo, [[Chrystal Macmillan]] and [[Sybil Thomas, Viscountess Rhondda]] of the UK, the [[Marquesa del Ter]] of Spain, [[Maria Vérone]] of France and [[Hélène Vacaresco]] of Romania, as well as various officers of the [[International Federation of University Women]] and others. She held public meetings to discuss the question of nationality in Geneva, London and Paris and attended a meeting at the Assembly of the [[League of Nations]] to obtain approval of a resolution for governments to attend a meeting discussing codification of laws and encouraged them to include women in their delegate selections. The resolution was submitted and passed unanimously.&lt;ref name="Lee (1929), p 2"&gt;"Lee (1929)", p 2&lt;/ref&gt; In anticipation of a cooperative meeting between women in Europe and the Americas a conference was held at the Pan American Union to present the topic of women's nationality.&lt;ref name="Lee (1929), p 3"&gt;"Lee (1929)", p 3&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the governing body of the Pan American Union created the Inter-American Commission of Women at their meeting in [[Havana]] on 4 April 1928. The provision called for a commission composed of seven women from the countries of the Americas and that those women should review data and prepare information to allow the Seventh Pan American Conference to consider women's civil and political equality in the region. It also called for expansion of the commission to eventually have one delegate for each country in the Pan American Union.&lt;ref name="Lee (1929), p 3" /&gt; Stevens, who had suggested the commission was appointed as chair and the other six countries were selected by lot. The chosen countries were Argentina, Colombia, El Salvador, Haiti, Panama, and Venezuela and the appointed delegates were Dr. [[Ernestina A. López]] de Nelson from Argentina, [[María Elena de Hinestrosa]] from Colombia, [[María Alvárez de Guillén Rivas]] from El Salvador, [[Alice Téligny Mathon]] from Haiti, [[Clara González]] from Panama and [[Lucila Luciani de Pérez Díaz]] from Venezuela.&lt;ref name="Lee (1929), p 4"&gt;"Lee (1929)", p 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930 Havana meeting===
The headquarters of the CIM were to be located in Washington DC in the offices of the Pan-American Union, but there was no organized staff and only some of the women had the backing of their governments. Most were chosen from the women’s organizations in their countries. To foster on-going unity and continuity, the women decided to meet every two years, in addition to meeting for the scheduled Pan-American Conferences. As such, the first meeting was held in Havana in 1930.&lt;ref name="Towns (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Towns|first1=Ann|title=The Inter-American Commission of Women and Women's Suffrage, 1920-1945|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|date=2010|issue=42|page=793|url=https://www.academia.edu/8578136/The_Inter-American_Commission_of_Women_and_Womens_Suffrage_1920-1945|accessdate=13 July 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members were, [[Flora de Oliveira Lima]] (Brazil), [[Aída Parada]] (Chile), [[Lydia Fernández]] (Costa Rica), [[Elena Mederos de González]] (Cuba), [[Gloria Moya de Jiménez]] (Dominican Republic), [[Irene de Peyré]] (Guatemala), [[Margarita Robles de Mendoza]] (Mexico), [[Juanita Molina de Fromen]] (Nicaragua), [[Clara González]] (Panama), [[Teresa Obregoso de Prevost]] (Peru), and Doris Stevens (USA).&lt;ref name="1930 seminar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seminar on Feminism and Culture in Latin America|title=Women, culture, and politics in Latin America|date=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-0-520-90907-6|page=17|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=dxz36kM7RsEC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As their governments provided no funding for their attendance, only the women from Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Panama, the United States&lt;ref name="Towns (2010)" /&gt; and delegates from [[Alicia Ricode de Herrera]] (Colombia), MMe Fernand Dennis (Haiti), El Salvador by proxy and [[Cecilia Herrera de Olavarría]] (Venezuela)&lt;ref name="1930 meeting members" /&gt; were able to attend, A group of psychiatrists, who had asked if they could attend and observe the meeting, intimidated the women and little was accomplished.&lt;ref name="Towns (2010)" /&gt;

===1933 extension===
At the Seventh Pan-American Conference, held in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay the women presented their analysis of the legal status of women in each of the twenty-one countries in the Pan-American Union. It was the first report ever to study in detail the civil and political rights of women and it had been prepared solely by women. The conference considered and rejected the proposed Treaty on the Equality of Rights for Women, though it was signed by Cuba, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay.&lt;ref name="1933 resolutions"&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's First Treaty of Equality for Women - Montevideo, Uruguay, 1933 |url=http://portal.oas.org/Portal/Topic/Comisi%C3%B3nInteramericanadeMujeres/Historia/TratadosobreigualdadparalaMujerUruguay1933/tabid/660/Default.aspx?language=en-us |website=Organización de los Estados Americanos |publisher=Inter-American Commission of Women |accessdate=13 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160226233818/http://portal.oas.org/Portal/Topic/Comisi%C3%B3nInteramericanadeMujeres/Historia/TratadosobreigualdadparalaMujerUruguay1933/tabid/660/Default.aspx?language=en-us |archivedate=26 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of those states had already granted suffrage to women, and none of the four ratified the Treaty after the conference. However, the women had presented the first international resolution to recommend suffrage for women.&lt;ref name="Towns (2010), p 795"&gt;"Towns (2010)", p 795&lt;/ref&gt;

The women presented their materials which showed the disparity between rights of men and women. For example, in 16 countries of the Americas women could not vote at all, in two countries they could vote with restrictions and in three countries they had equal enfranchisement. In 19 of the American countries, women did not have equal custody over their children, including in 7 US states and only 2 countries allowed joint authority for women of their own children. None of the Latin American countries allowed women to serve on juries and 27 US states prohibited women from participating in juries. Divorce grounds in 14 countries and 28 states were disparate for men and women and a woman could not administer her own separate property in thirteen countries and two US states.&lt;ref name="separate laws part 1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ganzert|first1=Frederic W.|title=Get Half a Loaf|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2915066/1st_12/|accessdate=31 July 2015|publisher=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=27 December 1936|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|page=C5|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="separate laws part 2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ganzert|first1=Frederic W.|title=Get Half a Loaf|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2915118/2nd_part_women_only_get_half_a_loaf_p/|accessdate=31 July 2015|publisher=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=27 December 1936|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|page=C10|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conference reviewed the data and approved the first international agreement ever adopted concerning the women's rights—the Convention on the Nationality of Women. The instrument made it clear that should a woman marry a man of a different nationality, her citizenship could be retained.&lt;ref name="1933 resolutions" /&gt;  The specific language was, “There shall be no distinction based on sex as regards to nationality.” In addition, the conference passed the Convention on Nationality which established that neither marriage nor divorce could affect the nationality of the members of a family, extending citizenship protection to children as well.&lt;ref name="Shepherd (2014)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shepherd|first1=Laura J. (editor)|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-1-134-75252-2|page=326|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=VWAKBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA326&amp;ots|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration argued that the women's job had been completed. Rather than voting for a continuation of the CIM, the Conference voted as a unit, with the exception of Argentina, to block the US proposal to shut down the women.&lt;ref name="Towns (2010), p 796"&gt;"Towns (2010)", p 796&lt;/ref&gt;

===1938 permanent status===
At the 1938 Conference of the Pan-American States, held in Lima, Peru, the US delegation introduced two resolutions. The first, which was actually aimed at wresting control of CIM from Doris Stevens, proposed reorganizing the Inter-American Commission of Women, making it permanent and giving each government the means to appoint their own “official” representative. Disregarding the other delegates’ lack of support, the Roosevelt administration maintained that Stevens was not an official US representative as she had been appointed by the Pan-American Union and appointed [[Mary Nelson Winslow]] of the US Department of Labor’s Women’s Bureau as their delegate.&lt;ref name="Bredbenner (1998)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bredbenner|first1=Candice Lewis|title=A nationality of her own: women, marriage, and the law of citizenship|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-20650-2|pages=246–247| url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=-MipgOSqZkAC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the US initiative was adopted and the CIM was fully reorganized between 1938 and 1940 as a subsidiary commission of the Pan-American Union. It lost its autonomy becoming an official governmental entity bound by state aims, but gained official financing and support.&lt;ref name="Towns (2010), p 799"&gt;"Towns (2010)", p 799&lt;/ref&gt;

The other was a resolution endorsing protective legislation for women.&lt;ref name="Bredbenner (1998)" /&gt; Feminismo Peruano ZAC, the primary suffrage organization in Peru,&lt;ref name="Towns (2010), p 797"&gt;"Towns (2010)", p 797&lt;/ref&gt; publicly took a position similar to the US and split from the oﬃcial position of Stevens and CIM to back the Equal Rights Treaty. The Peruvian women, couched their plea for suffrage in terms of protection of traditional values of the church, the family, charity and honor. Giving women the vote so that they could help protect these fundamental goals of the nation,&lt;ref name="Towns (2010), p 798"&gt;"Towns (2010)", p 798&lt;/ref&gt; the Lima Declaration in favor of Women's Rights proposed that women rights included “political treatment on the basis of equality with men, [and] to the enjoyment of equality as to civil status…to full protection in and opportunity for work, [and] to the most ample protection as mothers”.&lt;ref name="Threlkeld (2014)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Threlkeld|first1=Megan|title=Pan American Women: U.S. Internationalists and Revolutionary Mexico|date=2014|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=978-0-812-29002-8|page=195|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=HusJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA195&amp;lpg=PA195|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was approved&lt;ref name="Jain (2005)" /&gt; and was the first international acknowledgement of women's political and civil rights leading the way for other international organizations to follow suit.&lt;ref name="Threlkeld (2014), 196"&gt;"Threlkeld (2014)", 196&lt;/ref&gt;

===War years and 1940s===
In November 1939, the CIM headquarters were moved to Buenos Aires and the chairmanship of the organization passed from Winslow&lt;ref name="Threlkeld (2014), 197" &gt;"Threlkeld (2014)", 197&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Ana Rosa de Martínez Guerrero]] of Argentina.&lt;ref name="Towns (2010), p 799" /&gt; During the 1940s United States’ backing of women’s political rights supported the emancipation goals of the CIM, which increasingly called for its delegates to adopt proactive roles for suffrage. Voting rights were passed in El Salvador in 1939 and the Dominican Republic in 1942. The CIM delegates drafted multiple resolutions calling on the governments of the Americas to grant women suffrage and the 1943 meeting required delegates to work for both civil and political rights for women in their home countries instead of just observing and reporting on women's statuses. As further incentive, bulletins began to specifically mention delegates' activities, and what progress was being made. The 1944 assembly included women delegates from 19 of the 21 member countries of the Pan-American Union and 1945 saw Guatemala and Panama granting enfranchisement, followed by Argentina and Venezuela in 1947.&lt;ref name="Towns (2010), p 802" &gt;"Towns (2010)", p 802&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1945, the CIM delegation successfully moved that the phrase “the equal rights of men and women” be inserted into the United Nations Charter, citing the precedent of the 1938 Lima Declaration.&lt;ref name="Smith (2008)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Bonnie G. (editor)|title=The Oxford encyclopedia of women in world history|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-195-14890-9|page=596|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&amp;pg=PA596&amp;lpg=PA596|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 9th Pan-American Conference, held in [[Bogotá]], Colombia, in 1948 culminated in the passage of two resolutions: the Inter-American Convention on Granting of Political Rights to Women and the Inter-American Convention on the Granting of Civil Rights to Women.&lt;ref name=background&gt;{{cite web|title=Inter-American Program on the Promotion of Women's Human Rights and Gender Equity and Equality|pages=1–7|url=http://www.oas.org/en/CIM/docs/PIA%5BEN%5D.pdf|website=Organization of American States|publisher=Inter-American Program on Women|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the Conference approval for the creation of the [[Organization of American States]], the CIM was brought under its umbrella and became an international forum for bringing women’s issues into public discourse.&lt;ref name="Smith (2008)" /&gt;

===Mid-century to close of the 20th century===
The push for suffrage of all member states continued to be a focus for the women through the early 1960s, with [[Paraguay]] being the last of the original member states to grant emancipation in 1961.&lt;ref name=suffrage&gt;{{cite web|title=Hemispheric Struggle for Women's Suffrage|url=http://portal.oas.org/Portal/Topic/Comisi%C3%B3nInteramericanadeMujeres/Historia/Luchaporelsufragiofemeninoenelhemisferio/tabid/662/Default.aspx?language=en-us|website=Organization of American States|publisher=Inter-American Commission of Women|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decades from the 1960s to the 1990s also saw the additions of the Nations of the [[Caribbean]] gaining their independence, joining the OAS and sending women delegates to the CIM. With the addition of [[Belize]] and [[Guyana]] in 1990, the organization's membership was representative of all independent nations in the Americas&lt;ref name="adding Caribbean"&gt;{{cite web|title=CIM Expands with the Inter-American System|url=http://portal.oas.org/Portal/Topic/Comisi%C3%B3nInteramericanadeMujeres/Historia/LaCIMcrececonelSistemaInteramericano/tabid/663/Default.aspx|website=Organization of American States|publisher=Inter-American Commission of Women|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; except [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="no cuba"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inter-American Commission of Women|url=http://www.oas.org/en/cim/members.asp|website=Organization of American States|publisher=Inter-American Commission of Women|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada joined as an observer member in 1972, and the focused changed from voting rights to protections against violence, and for health and employment programs.&lt;ref name="adding Caribbean" /&gt; By the 1970s [[gender]] perspectives had emerged with a recognition of gender-bias in terms of cultural, social and historical construction based on the biological basis of sex. There was recognition that biological sex itself does not create disparity, but rather the perceived differences of gender roles as defined by cultures and social tradition. In order for equality to occur, CIM recognized that cultural, economic, political and social systems needed to be evaluated and redesigned so that women and men equally benefit.&lt;ref name=background /&gt; They introduced the Regional Action Plan, targeted to include working class and indigenous women as well as the traditional educated, middle class women of previous decades. The CIM completed around 200 projects, between 1975 and 1985, ranging from entrepreneurship training to animal husbandry, from leadership training to skills development, from development of craft cooperatives to developing of labor unions and from providing legal aids to creating political awareness and participation.&lt;ref name=1976-1985&gt;{{cite web|title=Decade of Women in the Americas - 1976-1985|url=http://portal.oas.org/Portal/Topic/Comisi%C3%B3nInteramericanadeMujeres/Historia/ElDeceniodelaMujerenlasAm%C3%A9ricas19761985/tabid/665/Default.aspx|website=Organization of American States|publisher=Inter-American Commission of Women|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s use of [[Wartime sexual violence|rape as a tool in war]] by official regimes in [[El Salvador]], [[Haiti]], [[Peru]], and other places across Latin America was exposed, forcing violence against women into the forefront of public discourse. As dictatorships fell, women began to pressure their civilian governments to address the systemic violence against women from [[Brazil]] to [[Chile]] to [[Mexico]]. In 1988, CIM strategy followed its model of creating international norms to press for local governmental change. To that end, the women determined to draft an inter-American Convention focusing on violence against women and scheduled a special consultative meeting in 1990. The 1990 [[Inter-American Consultation on Women and Violence]] was the first diplomatic meeting of its kind.&lt;ref name="Meyer &amp; Prügl (1999)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyer|first1=Mary K.

The final instrument,&lt;ref name="Convention of Belém do Pará"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence Against Women - 1994|url=http://portal.oas.org/Portal/Topic/Comisi%C3%B3nInteramericanadeMujeres/Historia/Convenci%C3%B3nsobrelaViolenciacontralaMujer/tabid/666/Default.aspx|website=Organization of American States|publisher=Inter-American Commission of Women|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would become known as the 1994 [[Convention of Belém do Pará]], was the first treaty to ever address violence against women.&lt;ref name="Persadie (2012)" /&gt; It was presented at a Special Special Assembly of CIM delegates in April 1994, who approved it and endorsed its submission to the General Assembly of the OAS. It was adopted at [[Belém do Pará]], Brazil, in June 1994, and has been endorsed by 32 of the 34 member States of the OAS.&lt;ref name="Convention of Belém do Pará" /&gt;

The delegates of the CIM continued to press for international agreements throughout the Americas that effect change and protect women. In 1998, they adopted the Declaration of Santo Domingo, which recognized that women's inalienable rights exist throughout their lifetime and are an "integral, and indivisible part of universal human rights".&lt;ref name=background /&gt;

===21st century beginnings===
In 2000 the first Hemispheric Ministerial Meeting on the Advancement of Women was held and a new plan adopted for the new century. Thirty-three of the member states sent delegates and in addition, the meeting was attended by [[Madeleine Albright]] US Secretary of State; [[Gladys Caballero de Arévalo]], Vice President of Honduras; [[María Eugenia Brizuela de Ávila]], Foreign Minister of El Salvador; [[Indranie Chandarpal]], Guyana’s Minister of Human Services and Social Security and CIM Vice president; [[Graciela Fernández Meijide]], Argentinian Minister of Social Development and the Environment; and [[Marisabel Rodríguez de Chávez]], First Lady of Venezuela. The women adopted the  "Inter-American Program on the Promotion of Women’s Humans Rights and Gender Equity and Equality" with the goal of legal equality between men and women.&lt;ref name="21st century plans"&gt;{{cite web|title=First Hemispheric Ministerial Meeting on the Advancement of Women|url=http://portal.oas.org/Portal/Topic/Comisi%C3%B3nInteramericanadeMujeres/Documentos/ProgramasPlanesdeAcci%C3%B3n/ProgramaInteramericano/tabid/748/Default.aspx|website=Organization of American States|publisher=Inter-American Commission of Women|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current organization==
The current organizational structure calls for the Assembly of Delegates to meet every two years to examine hemispheric issues and evaluate reports of progress or concern. Meetings are held in even years and the elections which occur are effective for two year periods of the following odd years. For example, at the last meeting held in 2014 officers were elected to begin serving in 2015-2017.&lt;ref name="organizational structure"&gt;{{cite web|title=CIM Meetings|url=http://www.oas.org/en/cim/meetings.asp|website=Organization of American States|publisher=Inter-American Commission of Women|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIM Executive Committee has eight delegates elected at the bi-annual Assembly of Delegates meetings. They meet at more regular intervals to address areas of immediate concern. The Executive Committee membership has developed as follows:&lt;ref name="organizational structure" /&gt;

Every four years, CIM organizes the Meeting of Ministers or Meeting of the "Highest-Ranking Authorities responsible for the Advancement of Women in the Member States" (REMIM).  This meeting brings together those highest ranking women from each of the OAS member states for a discussion of policy, key issues, and recommendations of topics for ministerial level meetings, such as the [[Summit of the Americas]].&lt;ref name="organizational structure" /&gt;

At its discretion, the CIM can call discretionary meetings or extraordinary meetings to discuss policy, hold seminars of awareness or other educational or organizational meetings to advance the causes of women.&lt;ref name="organizational structure" /&gt;

'''James Benson''' "'''Jim'''" '''Irwin''' (March 17, 1930 &amp;ndash; August 8, 1991) ([[Colonel (United States)|Col]], [[United States Air Force|USAF]]) was an American [[astronaut]], [[aeronautical engineer]], [[test pilot]], and a [[United States Air Force]] [[Aviator|pilot]]. He served as [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] pilot for [[Apollo 15]], the fourth human lunar landing. Following his retirement from NASA, he became a prominent born-again Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.godreports.com/2011/03/encounter-with-jesus-on-the-moon-left-astronaut-changed/|title=Encounter with Jesus on the moon left astronaut changed {{!}} God Reports|website=blog.godreports.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the [[List of people who have walked on the Moon|eighth person to walk on the Moon]] and the first, and youngest, of those astronauts to die.&lt;ref name="tehabi"&gt;{{cite book | last = Reynolds | first = David West | title = Apollo: The Epic Journey to the Moon | publisher = Tehabi Books | year = 2002 | pages = 166–189 | isbn = 0-15-100964-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Irwin was born March 17, 1930, in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], of [[Scottish American|Scottish]] and [[Irish American|Irish]] descent, to parents James Irwin and Elsa Mathilda Irwin ({{nee|Strebel}}). Irwin's grandparents emigrated to the U.S. from Altmore Parish at [[Pomeroy, County Tyrone|Pomeroy]] in [[County Tyrone]], Ireland (now [[Northern Ireland]]) around 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Sam |title=To Ulster's Credit |origyear=1985 |year=1985 |page=123 |location=Killinchy, UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At about the age of 12, he informed his mother about his desire to go to the Moon, letting her know that he might be the first person to do so&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvSjxlrSAIA&amp;t=2m56s Interview with Jim Irwin's parents after his selection to NASA] (1966, published at YouTube on Jan 17, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; (he ended up being the eighth).  He graduated from [[East High School (Salt Lake City)|East High School]] in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] in 1947. He received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in Naval Science from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1951, and [[Master of Science]] degrees in [[Aeronautical Engineering]] and [[Instrumentation Engineering]] from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="nasabio"&gt;{{cite web | title = Biographical Data: James Irwin | publisher = [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]], [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|date=August 1991| url = http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/irwin-jb.html | accessdate = 2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received initial flight training at [[Hondo Air Base]] and follow-on training at [[Reese Air Force Base]], [[Texas]]. He graduated from the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School|Air Force Experimental Test Pilot School]] (Class 60C) in 1961, and the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School|Aerospace Research Pilot School]] in 1963 (Class IV). Prior to joining [[NASA]], he was chief of the Advanced Requirements Branch at Headquarters [[Air Defense Command]]. During his time in the [[United States Air Force]] he received the [[Air Force Distinguished Service Medal]] and two [[Air Force Commendation Medal]]s. He also received an Air Force [[Outstanding Unit Citation]] while with the [[4750th Air Defense Wing|4750th Training Wing]].&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt;

Irwin was also a developmental test pilot for the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[YF-12]], the Mach 3 fighter-interceptor variant which preceded the [[SR-71 Blackbird]]. His first flight of that aircraft was on the day that one of his five children was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echoesofapollo.com/2011/08/01/living-with-an-american-hero-2/ |title=Living With an American Hero &amp;#124; Latest Space News |publisher=Echoesofapollo.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810054927/http://echoesofapollo.com/2011/08/01/living-with-an-american-hero-2/ |archivedate=2011-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, a student pilot that Irwin was training crashed the plane they were flying on a training mission. They both survived, but Irwin suffered [[compound fracture]]s, [[amnesia]], and nearly lost a leg.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Flight of the Falcon: The Thrilling Adventures of Colonel Jim Irwin&lt;/ref&gt; John Forrest, a U.S. Air Force [[orthopedic surgeon]], was instrumental in preventing the [[amputation]] of Irwin's leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stargazette.com/story/news/2015/09/18/orthopedic-surgeon-john-forrest-life-lived/72391736/|title=From Ike to athletes to Elmirans, surgeon touched many|publisher=Star Gazette|date=September 18, 2015|access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his military service, he accumulated more than 7,015 hours flying time, of which 5,300 hours were in [[jet aircraft]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Irwin was raised in a Christian household but stopped actively practicing the religion at age 10. He became a devout born-again Christian after returning from space.

In 1952, Irwin married his first wife, who was a Catholic. The two had an unhappy marriage made worse by his devotion to his work. By his own account, the marriage failed after two years due to his poor, borderline cruel treatment of her, and he later stated that finding religion again made familial relationships much easier.

In 1959, Irwin married his second wife, the former Mary Ellen Monroe. Irwin's second marriage consisted of two phases: an unhappy period from 1960 to 1971, and a very happy period from 1971 until his death in 1991, during which he was a Christian. Irwin and his wife, who abhorred being in the spotlight as an astronaut's wife, fought excessively during their first ten years of marriage, and they regularly discussed and threatened divorce, even in front of the kids. She once wrote a long list of reasons for divorcing him and gave only two reasons to remain married. Irwin wrote that his marriage did not end simply because his wife, who was moderately religious, never carried through with her plans, and he later accepted blame for the marital tensions. After Irwin became a born-again Christian, he mended relations with his wife, who also became a devout Christian, and the two enjoyed a very happy marriage until his death. In his autobiography, Irwin regretted not converting to Christianity earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/torulenightdisco00irwi|title=To rule the night : the discovery voyage of astronaut Jim Irwin|last=Irwin|first=James B.

==NASA career==
[[File:James Irwin's EVA suit from Apollo 15.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Irwin's Apollo 15 space suit]]
Irwin was one of the 19 [[astronaut]]s selected by NASA in [[List of astronauts by selection#1966|April 1966]]. He was chosen as Commander, with [[John S. Bull]] as Lunar Module Pilot, for [[LTA-8]], an environmental qualification test of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] in a vacuum chamber at the Houston [[Space Environment Simulation Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/roundups/issues/68-01-19.pdf|title=The Moon-Walker's New Clothes|publisher=NASA|volume=7|issue=7|date=January 19, 1968|access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then served as a member of the astronaut support crew for [[Apollo 10]], the first mission to carry the full Apollo stack to the Moon and the dry run for the first manned [[Moon landing]]. Following that assignment, Irwin served as backup Lunar Module Pilot for the second Moon landing mission, [[Apollo 12]].&lt;ref name="nmspacemuseum1" /&gt;

===Apollo 15===
{{Main|Apollo 15|Return of Apollo 15 to Earth}}
[[File:Apollo 15 Lunar Rover and Irwin.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Irwin and the lunar rover during Apollo 15]]
Between July 26 and August 7, 1971 – as the Apollo 15 [[Lunar Module|Lunar Module Pilot]] (LMP) – Irwin logged 295 hours and 11 minutes in space. His [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA) on the Moon's surface amounted to 18 hours and 35 minutes of the mission time (an additional 33 minutes was used to do a stand-up EVA by opening the LM's docking hatch to survey the surroundings and take photographs).&lt;ref name="lunarjourn"&gt;{{cite web| last = Woods| first = David| title = Mountains of the Moon | work = Apollo 15 Lunar Surface Journal| publisher = NASA | date = 2006-09-14| url = http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/a15.html#The_Genesis_Rock| accessdate = 2007-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Irwin and [[David Scott]]'s mission was more science-based than previous missions, which meant that they received intensive geological training to meet the demanding nature of the J-Mission profile.&lt;ref name="tehabi"/&gt;  This extra training is credited with allowing them to make one of the most important discoveries of the Apollo era, the [[Genesis Rock]].&lt;ref name="lunarjourn"/&gt;

[[File:Apollo 15 flag, rover, LM, Irwin.jpg|thumb|right|James Irwin salutes the [[Flag of the United States|United States flag]] on the Moon on August 1, 1971]]

Apollo 15 landed in the Moon's [[Hadley–Apennine (Moon)|Hadley-Apennine]] region, noted for its mountains and [[rille]]s.&lt;ref name="tehabi"/&gt; As a J-Mission, they would spend more time on the moon than previous missions, to allow for three EVAs.  As well, Irwin was the first automobile passenger on the Moon as Scott drove the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] (LRV) carried along for this mission in the [[Lunar Module]] (LM) Falcon's Descent Stage.&lt;ref name="tehabi"/&gt; Scott and Irwin's stay on the Moon was just under three days at 66 hours and 54 minutes.&lt;ref name="tehabi"/&gt;

Once the [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] procedure was completed between ''Falcon'' and the ''Endeavour'' [[Apollo Command/Service Module|CSM]], Irwin and Scott were busy moving items like rock samples into the CSM and preparing the Lunar Module for final separation. During this intense period of work the earliest symptoms of a heart condition appeared.&lt;ref name="chaikin"/&gt; Both Scott and Irwin had been working with no sleep for 23 hours, during which they conducted a final moonwalk, performed the ascent from the lunar surface, rendezvoused with ''Endeavour'', and encountered the problems that delayed the Lunar Module jettison maneuver.&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{cite web | last = Woods | first = David | title = Apollo 15 Flight Summary | work = Apollo Flight Journal | publisher = [[National Aeronautic and Space Administration]] | date = 2004-05-28 | url = http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/ap15fj/a15summary.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070324112052/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/ap15fj/a15summary.htm | archivedate = 2007-03-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The astronauts' [[physiological]] [[vital signs]] were being monitored back on Earth, and the [[flight surgeon]]s noticed some irregularities in Irwin's heart rhythms.&lt;ref name="journal"/&gt; Irwin's heart had developed [[Numbering aberrant rhythms|bigeminy]].&lt;ref name="kraft"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kraft | first1 = Chris| authorlink1 = Chris Kraft | last2= Schefter | first2=James L.| title = Flight: My life in Mission Control| publisher = [[Penguin Group]]|date=March 2001| location = New York| pages = 342–34 | isbn =  0-525-94571-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Charles Berry stated to [[Chris Kraft]], deputy director of the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]] (MSC) at the time: "It's serious, [i]f he were on Earth. I'd have him in [[Intensive Care Unit|ICU]] being treated for a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]."&lt;ref name="kraft"/&gt; However, Berry concluded that since ''Endeavour'''s cabin atmosphere was 100% oxygen when in space, Irwin was in the best of circumstances.&lt;ref name="kraft"/&gt; Specifically, "In truth, ... he's in an ICU.  He's getting one hundred percent oxygen, he's being continuously monitored, and best of all, he's in zero ''g''. Whatever strain his heart is under, well, we can't do better than zero ''g''."&lt;ref name="kraft"/&gt;

During the post-[[trans-Earth injection]] (TEI) phase of the mission there wasn't much more for Irwin to do other than provide help with [[Alfred Worden|Al Worden]]'s EVA to retrieve film magazines from the CSM's SIM bay, by donning a pressure suit and monitoring him. He was able to rest and apparently recover during the rest of the mission.&lt;ref name="chaikin"&gt;{{cite book | last = Chaikin | first = Andrew | authorlink = Andrew Chaikin | title = A Man on the Moon | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | origyear = 1994 | year = 1998| location = Toronto | isbn = 0-14-027201-1  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The flight surgeons continued to monitor his EKG until splashdown, but his heart rhythm was normal.&lt;ref name="kraft"/&gt; This incident was not discussed during the mission debriefing sessions, and the condition did not appear when he returned to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/outreach/SignificantIncidents/assets/apollo_15_crew_debrief.pdf|title=Apollo 15 Technical Crew Debriefing|date=August 14, 1971|publisher=NASA|access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-NASA career==
{{see also|Apollo 15 postage stamp incident}}
After the return of Apollo 15 to Earth, it was discovered that, without authority, the crew had taken 398 commemorative [[First day of issue|first day covers]] to the moon of which a hundred were then sold to a [[German people|German]] [[stamp dealer]]. The profits of the sale were intended to be used to establish trust funds for the Apollo 15 crew's children. NASA had turned a blind eye to similar activities on earlier flights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Worden|first=Al|authorlink=Al Worden|title=Falling to Earth: An Apollo 15 Astronaut's Journey to the Moon|date=July 2011|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|isbn=978-1588343093}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on this occasion the administration reprimanded the astronauts, and they never got any funds from the sales. Irwin had announced his intent to retire from the Air Force and resign from NASA prior to the reprimand.&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/10/us/james-b-irwin-61-ex-astronaut-founded-religious-organization.html|title=James B.

By his own admission, Irwin was not a committed Christian during his years at NASA. After his retirement as a [[Colonel]] in 1972, Irwin founded the High Flight Foundation. He spent the next 20 years as a "Goodwill Ambassador for the Prince of Peace", stating that "Jesus walking on the earth is more important than man walking on the moon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highflightfoundation.org/about_us |title=Colonel James B.

Beginning in 1973, Irwin led several [[Searches for Noah's Ark|expeditions]] to [[Mount Ararat]], [[Turkey]], in search of the remains of [[Noah's Ark]]. In 1982, he was injured during the descent and had to be transported down the mountain on horseback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/18/world/rush-to-climb-ararat-gives-a-town-a-lift.html|title=Rush To Climb Ararat Gives Town A Lift|last=Howe|first=Marvine|work=The New York Times|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''More Than Earthlings'', Irwin wrote expressing his view that the [[Genesis creation narrative]] was real, literal history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Bergman | first1=Jerry | title=Colonel James Irwin: Creationist Astronaut  | url=https://www.icr.org/article/7724/ | date=2013 | publisher=''[[Institute for Creation Research]]'' (from ''Acts &amp; Facts. 42 (11)'') | accessdate=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Irwin|first=James B.|title=More Than Earthlings: An Astronaut's Thoughts for Christ-Centered Living|date=July 1983|publisher=Baptist Sunday School Board|isbn=978-0805452556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Col. James Benson Irwin (18974687520).jpg|thumb|Grave of Col. James Benson Irwin]]
Irwin suffered at least three serious heart attacks. One occurred less than two years after Apollo 15, when Irwin was 43, while he was playing [[handball]]. Irwin suffered another heart attack in 1986, when he collapsed during a run and was found pulseless on a curb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/08/us/ex-astronaut-apparently-has-heart-attack-while-jogging.html|title=Ex-Astronaut Apparently Has Heart Attack While Jogging|work=The New York Times|date=8 June 1986|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors from NASA doubted the incidents were related to space travel, and noted that pre-flight testing indicated a tendency for [[cardiac arrhythmias]] during strenuous exercise.&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"/&gt;

On August 8, 1991, Irwin suffered another heart attack after a bike ride earlier that day. Attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful, and Irwin died later that day in the hospital. He was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|1782|James Benson Irwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his widow, Mary Ellen, to whom he was married to for three decades, and their five children.&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"/&gt;

Of the 12 men who have walked on the moon, Irwin was the first to die. The [[James Irwin Charter High School|James Irwin Charter School]]s were founded in Colorado in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jamesirwin.org/|title=James Irwin Charter Schools|publisher=James Irwin Charter Schools|access-date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A patch cut by Irwin from a backpack abandoned on the Moon during the Apollo 15 mission was auctioned at [[Christie's]] in 2001 for {{US$|310,500}} in a consignment of material from Irwin's estate that garnered "a combined $500,000".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Antiques Roadshow Insider |title=Irwin backpack patch sale|volume=7 |issue=2 |page=11 |date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jewish identity''' is the objective or subjective state of [[Identity (social science)|perceiving oneself]] as a Jew and as relating to being [[Jews|Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=87sx1v9UmlQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=jewish+identity&amp;sig=uWlgMwXei1dyZFhqvXV3RxvWK3I ''Spinoza, Liberalism, and the Question of Jewish Identity'']. [[Yale University Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Under a broader definition, Jewish identity does not depend on whether a person is regarded as a Jew by others, or by an external set of religious, or legal, or sociological norms. Jewish identity does not need to imply religious orthodoxy.  Accordingly, Jewish identity can be [[Cultural Judaism|cultural]] in nature. Jewish identity can involve ties to the Jewish community.  Orthodox Judaism bases Jewishness on matrilineal descent. According to Jewish law ([[halacha]]), all those born of a Jewish mother are considered Jewish, regardless of personal beliefs or level of observance of Jewish law.

[[Atheist Jew|Jews who are atheists]] may have a Jewish identity. While the absolute majority of people with this identity are of Jewish ethnicity, people of a [[Who is a Jew?#"Half-Jewish"|mixed Jewish and non-Jewish background]] or [[gentiles]] of [[Zera Yisrael|Jewish ancestry]] may still have a sense of Jewish self-identity.

==Categories==
Jewish identity can be described as consisting of three interconnected parts:

#'''[[Jewish peoplehood]]''', an ethnic identity composed of [[Jewish ethnic divisions|several subdivisions]] that [[ethnogenesis|evolved]] in the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]].
#'''[[Judaism|Jewish religion]]''', observance of spiritual and ritual tenets of Judaism.
#'''[[Jewish culture]]''', celebration of traditions, [[secular Jew|secular]] and religious alike.

==A cultural/ancestral concept==
Jewish identity can be [[cultural]], religious, and/or through ancestry. There are religious, cultural, and ancestral components to Jewish identity due to its fundamental non-proselytizing nature, as opposed to Christian or Muslim identity which are both "universal" religions in that they ascribe to the notion that their faith is meant to be [[missionary|spread]] throughout all of humanity, regardless of nationality, (and still are, though to a far lesser extent than throughout its history in the case of Christianity).&lt;ref&gt;Galatians 6:11, Romans 16:22, Colossians 4:18, 2 Thessalonians 3:17&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jewish identity is firmly intertwined with Jewish ancestry dating back to the historical [[Kingdom of Israel (United Monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]], which was largely depopulated by the Roman Empire c. first century CE, leading to what is known as today as the [[Jewish Diaspora]].

==In contemporary sociology==
{{see also|Sociology of Jewry}}
Jewish identity began to gain the attention of Jewish sociologists in the United States with the publication of [[Marshall Sklare]]'s "Lakeville studies".&lt;ref&gt;Sklare, Marshall, Joseph Greenblum, and Benjamin Bernard Ringer. The Lakeville Studies. Under the Dir. of Marshall Sklare. Basic books, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other topics explored in the studies was Sklare's notion of a "good Jew".&lt;ref&gt;Sklare, Marshall. "The Image of the Good Jew in Lakeville." Observing America’s Jews. Brandeis University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The "good Jew" was essentially an idealized form of Jewish identity as expressed by the Lakeville respondents. Today, sociological measurements of Jewish identity have become the concern of the Jewish Federations who have sponsored numerous community studies across the U.S.;&lt;ref&gt;Sheskin, Ira M. "Comparisons between local Jewish community studies and the 2000–01 National Jewish Population Survey." ''[[Contemporary Jewry]]'' 25, no. 1 (2005): 158-192.&lt;/ref&gt; policy decisions (in areas such as funding, programming, etc.) have been shaped in part due to studies on Jewish identity.

==Antisemitism and Jewish identity==
According to the social-psychologist Simon Herman, antisemitism plays a part in shaping Jewish identity.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Simon N. Jewish identity: A social psychological perspective. Transaction Pub, (1989): 51.&lt;/ref&gt; This view is echoed by religious leaders such as [[Rabbi]] [[Jonathan Sacks]] who writes that modern Jewish communities and the modern Jewish identity are deeply influenced by [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/09/003-love-hate-and-jewish-identity-12 Love, Hate, and Jewish Identity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414202138/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/09/003-love-hate-and-jewish-identity-12 |date=14 April 2012 }}, by Jonathan Sacks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22775">The '''Lao Veterans of America''', Inc., describes itself as a non-profit, non-partisan, non-governmental, veterans organization that represents Lao- and Hmong-American veterans who served in the U.S. clandestine war in the [[Kingdom of Laos]] during the [[Vietnam War]] as well as their refugee families in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Lao Veterans of America, Inc. http://www.laoveteransofamerica.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vietnam War and the Kingdom of Laos==

Members of the Lao Veterans of America, Inc., (LVA) served in the U.S. clandestine war in the  [[Kingdom of Laos]] during the [[North Vietnamese invasion of Laos]] and Vietnam conflict. These veterans served in the U.S. "Secret Army" in Laos, as well as the [[Royal Lao Army]], and are largely recruits from the ethnic [[Hmong people]], and other Laotian tribal minority peoples, as well as ethnic lowland Lao. They engaged in combat operations, and provided support, for key U.S. covert air and ground operations including [[Operation Barrel Roll]] against the [[North Vietnamese Army]] and [[People's Army of Vietnam]] and communist Pathet Lao forces.  Laotian and Hmong soldiers, first backed and armed by President [[John F. Kennedy]], the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), and U.S. Department of Defense, also interdicted North Vietnamese forces and supplies on the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] in Laos.

== American clandestine and Special Forces advisers==

CIA clandestine and U.S. military leaders, officers, operatives and advisers to the U.S. Secret Army in Laos included notable U.S. national security figures including: [[William Colby]], [[Richard Helms]], [[Theodore Shackley]], [[Anthony Poshepny]], Lawrence Devlin and others.&lt;ref name="highbeam1996"&gt;Scheets, Gary, Washington Times (8 May 1996) "Refugees from Laos mourn a friend, Colby: Tribe worked closely with ex-CIA leader." http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56826837.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lao Veterans of America's members worked in cooperation with many of these figures during the Vietnam War in Laos and its aftermath.&lt;ref name="highbeam1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loeb, Vernon, Washington Post (15 October 2000), "CIA Figure Lobbies for Secret Warriors' Widows; Measure to Aid Naturalization of Lao and Hmong Spouses Is Lodged in Senate" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-555885.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Tens of thousands of Laotian and Hmong veterans, and their families, fled the communist [[Pathet Lao]] takeover of Laos in 1975 as refugees, and were eventually granted political asylum, and resettled in the United States, including Lao Hmong leader General [[Vang Pao]].

Philip Smith, serves as the Washington, D.C. Director and Liaison for the Lao Veterans of America, Inc., and has advocated on a variety of issues for the Laotian and Hmong-American community as well as representing the organization in the [[US Congress]] and on Capitol Hill. Smith has acted as Washington, D.C. Director for the LVA since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Zeller, Shawn, National Journal, (Feb. 20, 1999) "From the K Street Corridor:  Vietnam Warriors"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, (Dec. 1, 2001) "They earned it; Hmong-Americans"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laos Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery==

On May 14–15, 1997, twenty-two years after the end of the Vietnam War in Laos, a monument to the Lao and Hmong veterans and their American advisers who served in the Kingdom in Laos was during the Vietnam War was finally authorized by [[Arlington National Cemetery]].  The Lao Veterans of America, its Washington, D.C. Director, Philip Smith, and others, as well as tens of thousands of LVA members and their families, dedicated the monument in Arlington National Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Charles Q., Washington Times (24 August 1997) "Repaying a debt"&lt;/ref&gt; The LVA's Laotian and Hmong veterans also received national recognition at the Vietnam War Memorial for their covert service.&lt;ref&gt;Hamburger, Tom, Minneapolis Star Tribune (15 May 1997) "Hmong vets, who fought in secret, are honored..." http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62610224.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the United States acknowledged its covert role in Laos and the role of the Lao and Hmong veterans who served in the "U.S. Secret Army."&lt;ref&gt;Branigin, William, Washington Post (15 May 1997)"U.S. Allies in 'Secret War'; 'Long Overdue' Honors Go to Lao, Hmong Vets" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-728766.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Ben, Washington Times (14 May 1997) "Hmong veterans to receive medals: Laotian people became refugees after helping U.S. fight Vietnam War" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56811834.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asian Week (29 May 1997)"Hmong Hold War Recognition in Washington" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-3980026.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of Lao and Hmong-American veterans from across the United States and their families participated in the Arlington and Washington, D.C., national recognition ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Mary Lynn, Minneapolis Star Tribune,(11 May 1997) "Hmong veterans from Twin Cities heading to D.C. to attend tribute; Refugees back bill to ease citizenship requirements" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62610025.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lao Veterans of America, in cooperation with [[The Centre for Public Policy Analysis]], and others, continues to host annual veterans memorial ceremonies in Washington, D.C., and Arlington National Cemetery at the [[Laos Memorial]], each May, to honor the Lao and Hmong-American veterans, their refugee families, and their American U.S. Special Forces and clandestine advisers.&lt;ref name="highbeam2000"&gt;Madigan, Sean, Minneapolis Star Tribune, (10 May 2000) "Hmong to honor fallen soldiers and advocates for veterans' citizenship" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62412375.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;China Weekly News (22 June 2010) "Laos, Hmong Community Concludes National Memorial Ceremonies, Policy Events." http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-229137401.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Defense and Aerospace Week, (29 May 2013) "Laos, Hmong Veterans of Vietnam War Honored At National Ceremonies." http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-331528820.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PRNEWSWIRE, www.prnewswire.com (8 May 2007) "Laos, Hmong Veterans Memorial Ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery" http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/laos-hmong-veterans-memorial-ceremony-at-arlington-national-cemetery-58047832.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nylen, Leah, The Capital Times &amp; Medill News Service,(9 May 2007) "HMONG VETS MARK ANNIVERSARY" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-163178531.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Michael, McClatchy News / Fresno Bee (10 May 2013) "The Hmong, Vietnam era allies, honor their dead from a long-ago war" http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/05/10/190940/the-hmong-vietnam-era-allies-honor.html#.UerbJG3c2E4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Business Wire, www.businesswire.com, (12 May 2013) " Laos, Hmong Veterans of Vietnam War Honored At National Ceremonies" http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130512005048/en/Laos-Hmong-Veterans-Vietnam-War-Honored-National&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, prominent [[Hmong-American]] Dr. [[Cherzong Vang]], a former [[Minnesota]] President of the '''Lao Veterans of America''' was honored at veterans memorial ceremonies held at the Laos Memorial in Arlington by a jointed U.S. Armed Services honor guard along with Members of the [[US Congress]] and other officials.

On May 15, 2015, Lao- and Hmong-American veterans and their families from across the United States held a special 40th anniversary veterans memorial service in Arlington National Cemetery to mourn the fall of the Royal Kingdom of Laos to invading [[North Vietnamese Army]] forces of the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] and [[communist]] Pathet Lao guerrillas.  The ceremony included representatives and [[Green Berets]] of the U.S. [[Special Forces]] Association who served in Laos, Members of Congress and others.&lt;ref&gt;Businesswire.com, Center for Public Policy Analysis, Press Release,(03 June 2015), "Laos, Hmong, Vietnam Veterans, CPPA, Hold National Ceremonies" http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150603006545/en/Laos-Hmong-Vietnam-Veterans-CPPA-Hold-National&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honorary citizenship ==

From its inception in the early 1990s, the Lao Veterans of America, Inc. played a leadership role in the research, development, introduction and passage of the [[Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of 2000]].

In 2000, after a 10-year battle in the U.S. Congress, President [[Bill Clinton]] signed into law the [[Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of 2000]] to grant honorary citizenship to Lao and Hmong-American veterans of the U.S. "Secret Army." &lt;ref name="highbeam2000"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Washington Post, (3 May 2000), "Washington In Brief: House Backs Help For Hmong in Tests"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madigan, Sean, Minneapolis Star Tribune,(27 May 2000) "Clinton signs citizenship bill for Hmong veterans" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62413756.html&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was introduced by U.S. Congressman [[Bruce Vento]] (D-MN) of St. Paul, Minnesota, with bipartisan support from prominent Republicans, including Congressmen [[Lamar S. Smith|Lamar Smith]] (R-TX) of Texas and [[Henry Hyde]] of Illinois (R-IL), and others.  The Lao Veterans of America, and its Washington Director Philip Smith, engaged in a decade-long bipartisan effort in the U.S. Congress, and with Democratic and Republican Administrations in the White House, to promote the bill's passage and final implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Frommer, Frederic, Associated Press (AP), (2 May 2000) "House Approves Hmong Citizen Bill" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-26366831.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Michael, and Madigan, Sean, Minneapolis Star Tribune (24 May 2000) "Hmong citizenship bill wins final congressional OK".http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62413351.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post (3 May 2000) "Washington in Brief: House Backs Help For Hmong in Tests" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-523775.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frommer, Frederic, Associated Press, (23 May 2000) "Citizenship Bill Passes Congress" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-26753643.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wisconsin State Journal (24 May 2000) "BILL TO HELP HMONG GETS FINAL OK IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR MANY LAOTIANS TO GET U.S. CITIZENSHIP." http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-69303152.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seattle Post Intelligencer (24 May 2000)"BILL TO EASE CITIZENSHIP FOR LAOTIAN ALLIES BACKED" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63390423.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Economist (1 December 2001) "They earned it; Hmong-Americans.(Citizenship for Hmong refugees)" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-80511559.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The legislation took years to gain bipartisan U.S. Congressional approval before it was signed into law.  The LVA and Philip Smith worked to organize policy events and rallies on Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C., Virginia, California, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, North Carolina, and other states in support of the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Ben, Washington Times, (15 May 1998), "Hmong army veterans ask for U.S. citizenship"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Greg, Minneapolis Star Tribune, (12 June 1998) "House panel acts to help Hmong vets who fought for CIA gain citizenship." http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62580839.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Greg and Leslie, Lourdes Medrano, Star Tribune, Minneapolis (16 August 2001) "Vets getting their due; But glitch in law delays citizenship for other Hmong"&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] (D-MN) of Minnesota, and a bipartisan coalition, introduced the bill in the U.S. Senate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"/&gt;

Congressman Vento died of lung cancer the year the bill was signed into law. The Lao Veterans of America led efforts to memorialize Congressman Vento's legacy and assistance to the Lao- and Hmong veterans and their refugee families.&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, Andrew, Minneapolis Star Tribune (20 October 2000)"Hmong, Lao communities remember Bruce Vento..." http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-66244428.html&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional bill to assist Lao- and Hmong-American widows of veterans was later introduced and passed into law with the Lao Veterans of America again advocating in Congress and Washington, D.C., for passage of the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Loeb, Vernon, Washington Post (15 October 2000) "CIA Figure Lobbies for Secret Warriors' Widows; Measure to Aid Naturalization of Lao and Hmong Spouses Is Lodged in Senate" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-555885.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to human rights violations==

Working with [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], the [[Lao Human Rights Council]], and other human rights organizations, the Lao Veterans of America, and its Washington D.C. Director Philip Smith, have been active in Washington, D.C., and policy-making circles in staunch opposition to [[human rights]] violations, [[ethnic cleansing]],  and political and [[religious liberty]] and religious freedom [[persecution]] directed against the Lao and Hmong people by the [[Marxist-Leninist]] government of Laos and Socialist Republic of [[Vietnam]] (SRV). In the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, for nearly three decades, the Lao Veterans of America has also been active in opposition to the forced repatriation of Lao and Hmong [[refugees]] from Thailand back to the communist government in Laos that the refugees fled.  In the late 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, the LVA  participated in research missions, along with Members of Congress, and [[the Centre for Public Policy Analysis]] to Lao and Hmong refugee camps along the [[Mekong River]] and the Buddhist temple of [[Wat Tham Krabok]] to help document human rights violations under the [[Marxist]] regime in Laos and to seek to halt and reverse the forced repatriation policy directed against political refugees and asylum seekers in Thailand and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Washington, Wayne, Star Tribune (Minneapolis), (17 April 1996), "Agencies say influx of Hmong will go smoothly".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Ben, Washington Times (22 April 1996), "3,500 Laotians head for U.S. after 20 years in Thailand."&lt;/ref&gt; The LVA has raised repeated concerns about the ongoing role of the SRV and [[Vietnamese People's Army]] (VPA in support of the [[Pathet Lao]] Marxist government in Laos, especially with regard to [[illegal logging]], human rights violations, military attacks against Hmong civilians and political and religious dissident groups, and [[religious persecution]].

The Lao Veterans of America and its Washington Director Philip Smith have raised concerns about Laotian- and Hmong-American citizens who have been abducted or disappeared in Laos at the hand of communist Lao police or military officials including Houa Ly of the Green Bay area of Wisconsin and Michael Vang of Fresno, California who disappeared in April 1999 along the border of Thailand and Laos.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Marc, Washington Post, (29 November 1999), "Missing Tourists as Reprisal Victims? Laotian Refugees in U.S. Suspect Disappearance of Hmong Men Was No Accident."&lt;/ref&gt; Former U.S. Congressman [[Mark Andrew Green]], former Congressman [[George Radanovich]], and former Congressman [[Tom Lantos]],  held various hearings in the U.S. Congress about the Lao government's role in abducting the two Hmong-American men and other serious human rights violations in Marxist Laos and Thailand.  As of 2013, the two Hmong-American men, who are U.S. citizens, are still missing at the hands of communist officials in Laos along with other U.S. citizens, including Mr. Hakit Yang, of St. Paul, Minnesota and additional two of his colleagues, Mr. Cong Shi Neng Yang and Trillion Yunhaison.&lt;ref&gt;Baca, Maria Elena &amp; Ford, Tom, Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN), (4 September 2007), "St. Paul families fear for 3 Hmong men held in Laos"&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Hakit Yang and his two colleagues from Minnesota were held at [[Phonthong Prison]] in [[Vientiane]], Laos.  Human rights advocates [[Kerry and Kay Danes]], [[Amnesty International]], [[The Centre for Public Policy Analysis]], and the LVA helped to draw awareness to their plight and human rights violations in Laos directed against the Lao and Hmong people.

==Official Recognition by the U.S. Congress - House and Senate==

In 2002, the [[US Senate]] and [[US House]] unanimously passed special bills, including H. Con. Res. 406, to honor and recognize the Lao Veterans of America.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Congressional Record, "Honoring and commending the Lao Veterans of America, Laotian and Hmong veterans of the Vietnam War, and their families, for their historic contributions to the United States." https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/406/text&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hmong Veterans' Service Recognition Act &amp; Burial Honors Efforts in US Congress==

Members of Congress, and the Lao Veterans of America, are seeking to further honor Lao- and Hmong-American veterans who served during the Vietnam War and are requesting that the U.S. government authorize these veterans, upon their passing, to be buried in U.S. national veterans cemeteries administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Bills are pending in the U.S. Congress for this purpose introduced by Senator [[Lisa Murkowski]] of Alaska and Congressman [[Jim Costa]] of California.&lt;ref&gt;Business Wire, businesswire.com, (28 July 2010) "Laos, Hmong Veterans of Vietnam War Honored by Congress with National Burial Bill" http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100728006607/en/Laos-Hmong-Veterans-Vietnam-War-Honored-Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scoop Independent News, Auckland, New Zealand,(23 October 2011) "Laos, Hmong Veterans of Vietnam War Fight For Burial Honors" http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1110/S00673/laos-hmong-veterans-of-vietnam-war-fight-for-burial-honors.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Business Wire, businesswire.com, (7 February 2013) "Laos, Hmong Veterans Burial Honors Bill Introduced in U.S. Senate" http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130207006579/en/Laos-Hmong-Veterans-Burial-Honors-Bill-Introduced&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Business Wire, businesswire.com, (16 July 2013) "Senate Slated to Address Laos, Hmong Veterans Burial Honors" http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130716006692/en/Senate-Slated-Address-Laos-Hmong-Veterans-Burial&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Richard, Los Angeles Times, (6 February 2013) "Hmong soldiers who aided U.S. seek burial in national cemeteries" http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/06/nation/la-na-nn-hmong-soldier-cemeteries-20130206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Michael, McClatchy News / Fresno Bee )10 May 2013) "The Hmong, Vietnam era allies, honor their dead from a long-ago war" http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/05/10/190940/the-hmong-vietnam-era-allies-honor.html#.UerbJG3c2E4&lt;/ref&gt;

In May and July 2013, the U.S. Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, led by Senators [[Bernie Sanders]] and [[Richard Burr]], held a full committee hearing of the "Lao Hmong Veterans Burial Honors Bill." The potential Senate passage of legislation addressing, and studying, the plight of the Lao and Hmong veterans of the "U.S. Secret Army" in Laos seeking burial honors at U.S. national veterans cemeteries has been reported in Washington,D.C. and on Capitol Hill &lt;ref&gt;Business Wire, (29 July 2013) "U.S. Senate Nears Passage of Veterans Bill Honoring Laos, Hmong Veterans" http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130729006544/en/U.S.-Senate-Nears-Passage-Veterans-Bill-Honoring&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip Smith, provided testimony on behalf of the Lao Veterans of America at the U.S. Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, U.S. Senate, (15 May 2013), Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, led by [[Bernard Sanders]], and the bill's other Senate cosponsors, included the burial honors bill into a very large. and comprehensive omnibus veterans bill. However, spending disputes about funding the much larger veterans affairs bill led to its defeat. Nevertheless, the stand-alone bill continued to gain bipartisan support and cosponsors in the House and Senate as the result of the Lao Veterans of America and others continuing to raise awareness of the legislation in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Richard, (27 February 2014) Los Angeles Times "Hmong vets suffer setback in quest for burial at U.S. cemeteries" http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-vietnam-war-hmong-20140227-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, in the U.S. House of Representatives, the bill continued to gain bipartisan support, from both Republicans and Democrats, and additional official Congressional cosponsors, who signed on the legislation in significant numbers.  Also, in 2014, the pending legislation was officially named '''"The Hmong Veterans' Service Recognition Act"''' by Members of the [[US Congress]] who introduced and officially cosponsored the bill.

==Support for Filipino veterans of World War II==

Since the 1990s, the Lao Veterans of America, has repeatedly worked with, and supported, the efforts of [[World War II]] veterans of the U.S.-backed forces in the [[Philippines]] to educate the [[US Congress]] about their unique contribution and unique relationship with the [[US Department of Defense]] during the Second World War.  On a numerous occasions, and within the context of the [[Bataan Death March]], and other extraordinary sacrifices during World War II, the LVA has joined in support of the Filipino veterans efforts in Washington, D.C., Congress, and [[Capitol Hill]] to seek U.S. veterans honors and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Congressional Hearing Statement of U.S. Senator Brian Schatz, Hawaii, (12 June 2013) U.S. Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Hearing on Pending Veterans Benefits Legislation, U.S. Government Printing Office, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-113shrg82714/html/CHRG-113shrg82714.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Light of Truth Award''' is a [[human rights]] [[award]] which is presented nearly annually by the [[International Campaign for Tibet]] (ICT), an [[non-governmental organization|NGO]] aiming for the promotion of [[democracy]] and [[human rights]] for the [[Tibetan people]]. The award is presented since 1995 by the fourteenth [[Dalai Lama]], [[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]], to the recipients personally.

The prize consists of a homely Tibetan [[butter lamp]] that serves as a symbol of the extraordinary light that every recipient brought to [[Tibet]]. In 2005 the ICT received an award itself, the ''[[Geuzenpenning]]'', a human rights award from the [[Netherlands]].

The Light of Truth Award is granted to persons and organizations that have publicly contributed substantially to the rise of and battle for human rights and democratic freedoms of the Tibetan people. In one occasion, in 2001, the award was presented to the whole [[people of India]] and it was taken delivery of by president [[R. Venkataraman]].

Low-threshold programs may be contrasted with "high-threshold" programs, which require the user to accept a certain level of control and which demand that the patient accept counselling.&lt;ref name=Waal2000&gt;{{cite web|last=Waal|first=Helge|title=Risk reduction as a component of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to drug abuse problems |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/pompidou/Source/AboutUs/TasksStructure/Sintra/SintraWaal_en.pdf |publisher=The Pompidou Group |accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low-threshold treatment programs are not to be confused with simple [[needle exchange program]]s, and may include comprehensive healthcare and counseling services.&lt;ref name="IslamDay2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rogers2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rogers | first1 = S.

According to that Editorial, low-threshold services for drug users can be defined as those which offer services to drug users; do not impose abstinence from drug use as a condition of service access; and endeavour to reduce other documented barriers to service access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM, Topp, L, Conigrave, KM, and Day, C |title= Defining a service for people who use drugs as ‘low-threshold’: What should be the criteria? |journal=International Journal of Drug Policy |volume=24 |pages=220–222 |year=2013 |pmid= 23567101 |doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2013.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Drug injection|Injection drug]] users (IDUs) are at risk of a wide range of health problems arising from non-sterile injecting practices, complications of the drug itself or of the lifestyle associated with drug use and dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Latt|first=N.; Conigrave, K.; Marshall, J.; Saunders, J.; Marshall, J.; Nutt, D.|title=Addiction Medicine|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199539338|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Medicine/PsychiatryPsychology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199539338|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604154155/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Medicine/PsychiatryPsychology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199539338|archivedate=2011-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, unrelated health problems, such as [[diabetes]], may be neglected because of [[substance dependence|drug dependence]]. However, despite their increased health care needs, IDUs do not have the required access to care or may be reluctant to use conventional services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McCoy | first1 = C. B. | last2 = Metsch | first2 = L. R. | last3 = Chitwood | first3 = D. D. | last4 = Miles | first4 = C. | title = Drug use and barriers to use of health care services | journal = Substance Use &amp; Misuse | volume = 36 | issue = 6–7 | pages = 789–806 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11697611 | doi=10.1081/ja-100104091}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, their health may deteriorate to a point at which emergency treatment is required,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McDonald, P |title=From streets to sidewalks: developments in primary care services for injecting drug users |journal=Australian Journal of Primary Health |volume=8 |pages=65–69 |year=2002|doi=10.1071/PY02010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with considerable costs to both the IDUs and the health system. Accordingly, harm reduction based health care centers, also known as ''targeted health care outlet'' or ''low-threshold health care outlet'' for IDUs have been established across a range of settings utilising a variety of models.&lt;ref name="IslamDay2010"/&gt;  These targeted outlets provide integrated, low-threshold services within a harm-reduction framework targeting IDUs, and sometimes include social and/or other services. Where a particular service is not provided, referral and assistance with access is available. In 2007, for example, 33% of all US needle-syringe programs (NSPs) provided on-site medical care, and 7% provided [[buprenorphine]] treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Des Jarlais | first1 = D. C. | last2 = McKnight | first2 = C. | last3 = Goldblatt | first3 = C. | last4 = Purchase | first4 = D. | title = Doing harm reduction better: Syringe exchange in the United States | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02465.x | journal = Addiction | volume = 104 | issue = 9 | pages = 1441–1446 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19215605 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in many European countries NSP outlets serve as low-threshold primary health care centers targeting primarily IDUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index5778EN.html |title=Low-threshold services |publisher=The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction |accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health care models==
These targeted outlets vary widely and may be either "distributive", providing basic harm reduction services and simple healthcare with facilitated referrals to specialist services, or "one-stop-shops" where a range of services including specialist services are provided onsite. The services being offered by these outlets range from simple needle and syringe provision, to expanded services including basic and preventive primary healthcare, [[hepatitis B]]&amp;nbsp;[[hepatitis A|and&amp;nbsp;A]] vaccinations, [[hepatitis&amp;nbsp;C]] testing, counselling, [[tuberculosis]] screening and sometimes opioid maintenance therapy. Some centers offer hepatitis, HIV treatment and dental care.&lt;ref name=CDC2010&gt;{{Cite journal | author1 = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) | title = Syringe exchange programs --- United States, 2008 | journal = Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | volume = 59 | issue = 45 | pages = 1488–1491 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21085091}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of these outlets is to provide: (1) opportunistic health care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM, Reid, SE, White, A, Grummett, S, Conigrave, KM and Haber, PS |title=Opportunistic and continuing health care for injecting drug users from a nurse-run needle syringe program-based primary health-care clinic |journal=Drug Alcohol Rev. |volume=31 |pages=114–115 |year=2012 |pmid=22145983 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-3362.2011.00390.x/pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1465-3362.2011.00390.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2) increased temporal and spatial availability of health care, (3) trustworthy services of health care, (4) cost-effective mode of health care, (5) targeted and tailored services.&lt;ref name=Islam2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Islam | first1 = M.

In the United States as of 2011, 211 NSPs were known to be operating in 32 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the [[Native Americans in the United States#Current legal status|Indian Nations]].&lt;ref name=amFar2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Syringe Exchange Programs in the United States 2011|url=http://www.amfar.org/uploadedFiles/On_The_Hill/SEPS.pdf?n=3826)|publisher=amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bulk of funding has come from state and local governments,&lt;ref name=CDC2010/&gt; since for most of the last several decades, federal funding for needle exchange programs has been specifically banned.&lt;ref name=HuffPost2012&gt;{{cite news|title=Needle Exchange Programs Lose Federal Funding: Local AIDS Programs Brace For Cuts|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/04/needle-exchange-programs-san-francisco_n_1184420.html|accessdate=25 March 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post - San Francisco|first=Robin|last=Wilkey|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, as of 2008, at least 77 countries and territories offer NSPs with varying structures, aims and goals. Some countries use needle exchange services as part of integrated programs to contain drug use, while others aim simply to contain HIV infection as their top priority, considering reduction in incidence of drug use as a much lower priority.&lt;ref name=Cahill2009&gt;{{cite web|title=Syringe exchange programs around the world: The global context|url=http://www.gmhc.org/files/editor/file/gmhc_intl_seps.pdf|publisher=Gay Men's Health Crisis|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acceptance of NSPs vary widely from country to country. On the one hand, in Australia and New Zealand, electronic dispensing machines are available at selected locations such as the Auckland needle exchange and the Christchurch needle exchange, allowing needle exchange service 24 hours to registered users.&lt;ref name=Anderton2002&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderton|first=Jim|title=Needle and syringe exchange programme saves lives|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/node/15790|publisher=beehive.govt.nz, the official website of the New Zealand Government|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, over half of the countries in Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa retain the death penalty for drug offenses, although some have not carried out executions in recent years.&lt;ref name=IHRA2011&gt;{{cite web |title=Global State of Harm Reduction 2010|url=http://www.ihra.net/files/2010/06/29/GlobalState2010_Web.pdf |publisher=International Harm Reduction Association|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors from the 1997 Vancouver study have, in multiple publications, issued disclaimers against the misuse of their work by opponents of NSPs.  They point out that frequent attendees of the program tended to be young and often indulged in extreme high-risk behaviors.

{{Politics of Haiti}}

The '''National Council of Government''' ({{lang-fr|Conseil National de Gouvernement}}, CNG) was the ruling body of [[Haiti]] from 1986 to 1988. The council was first established on February 7, 1986, as a joint military and civilian [[provisional government]] following the exile of [[President for life]] [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]]. The council consisted of a President, Lieutenant General [[Henri Namphy]], and five Members, three from the military and two civilians. The military Members were Colonels [[Williams Régala]], [[Max Valles]], and [[Prosper Avril]], while the civilian Members were [[Gérard Gourgue]] and [[Alix Cinéas]].

Gourgue resigned from the council less than two months after it was formed, and Colonel Valles, Colonel Avril, and Cinéas were forced to resign soon after. The first National Council was officially dissolved on March 20, 1986. During its short life, the council took two important actions: it dissolved President Duvalier's paramilitary forces, the ''[[Tonton Macoute]]'' ({{lang-fr|Volontaires de la Sécurité Nationale}}, VSN) on February 15, and restored the blue and red [[flag of Haiti]] on February 17.

A second National Council with three constituents was established on March 21, 1986, the day after the first council was dissolved. The two remaining men of the first council, Henri Namphy and Williams Régala, reprised their positions as President and Member, respectively. [[Jacques A François]] joined the council as the second Member. This version of the National Council ruled until February 7, 1988, when [[Leslie François Manigat]] took office as [[President of Haiti]].

The '''Norwegian Heathen Society''' ({{lang-no|Det norske Hedningsamfunn}} (''DnH'') or ''Hedningsamfunnet''  for short) is a non-partisan irreligious society that was established in 1974 and whose main focus is counteracting the [[Church of Norway]] and [[Christian]] influence in [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jan Arild |last=Holbek |title=Hedningsamfunnet søker blasfemi-tiltale |url=http://www2.vl.no/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200441101023 |work=Vårt Land |language=Norwegian |date=2 November 2004 |accessdate=2007-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Heathen Society calls itself a [[humanism|humanist]] [[Antireligion|antireligious]] [[liberation movement]]. The organization advocates freedom of and, if need be, from [[religion]] and opposes [[Christian]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] influence.

From time to time it challenges the so-called "[[blasphemy]] paragraph" in section 142 of the [[Norwegian Penal Code]], which provides for punishment for anyone "who publicly insults or in an offensive manner shows contempt for any religious creed or for the doctrines or worship of any religious community lawfully existing [in Norway]". In 1982 it produced the cartoon ''Jesus Kristus &amp; Co.'', depicting [[Jesus]], which stirred considerable controversy. Charges were filed by the women's branch of the [[Kristelig Folkeparti|Christian Democratic Party]], but later dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Astrid |last=Meland |title=Jezzus!

Another of its actions was its successful demand for the right to call "God does not exist" from the rooftops after [[Oslo]] City Council granted a mosque the right to broadcast [[Adhan]] (prayer calls).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Oslo's rooftoop religious rivalry |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/695725.stm |work=BBC News |date=30 March 2000 |accessdate=2007-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society also supports the [[separation of church and state]].{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

==Purpose==
"The Norwegian Heathens’ Society advocates man as the end and the togetherness of humans as the means of human society. We advocate liberation from authoritarian religions and from faiths belittling and dividing men, which rate the value of humankind according to man’s relation to a deity, and which use norms and dogmata to further inhibit human thoughts and emotions. We promote the freedom of confession and oppose any confession-based discrimination in general, and we oppose The Church of Norway and other religious institutions in particular."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hedning.no/Brosjyre/heathen_whats%20that.html Heathen Society] explanation brochure in English&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nova – Center for Social Innovation''', promotes [[social innovation]] through [[public participation|civic participation]] and intercultural dialogue to help generate alternative socioeconomic models to [[globalization]], a culture of peace based on civil alternatives of defense and a more sustainable and participatory society.

Nova works with organizations and institutions interested in starting projects that promote [[social innovation]] and provide participative tools and services that allow citizens to become actively involved in these processes, including an emphasis on intercultural dialogue wherever possible.

The Nova association was born in the year 2000, but the team behind it has the experience of having taken active part in the Centre d'Estudis Joan Bardina (1983–1991) and EcoConcern (1992–1999), where it organised the Catalan Forum for Rethinking Society (1996–2001) within the framework of the [http://www.alliance21.org Alliance for a Responsible, Plural and United World] (1995–2001). Since 2003, Nova is a member of [[Nonviolent Peaceforce]] and through its NoViolenciaActiva Team (known as "Forces de Pau Noviolentes" until 2006) it promotes activities on the culture of peace and nonviolence, attempting to implement systems of nonviolent intervention and civilian resistance in conflict areas.

Since 2008, Nova has been working on the project [[Barcelona Consensus]]: Intercultural Alternatives to Neoliberal Globalization.

'''Organic farming''' is a phrase coined early in the 20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices to describe what other species use, and used, to farm without synthetic chemicals. Organic farming continues to be developed by various organic agriculture organizations today. It relies on fertilizers of organic origin such as compost [[manure]], [[green manure]], and [[bone meal]] and places emphasis on techniques such as [[crop rotation]] and [[companion planting]]. [[Biological pest control]], mixed cropping and the fostering of insect predators are encouraged. In general, organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally occurring substances while prohibiting or strictly limiting synthetic substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.usda.gov/2012/01/25/organic-101-allowed-and-prohibited-substances/|title=USDA Blog  » Organic 101: Allowed and Prohibited Substances|website=blogs.usda.gov|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, naturally occurring pesticides such as [[pyrethrin]] and [[rotenone]] are permitted, while synthetic [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticide]]s are generally prohibited. Synthetic substances that are allowed include, for example, [[Copper(II) sulfate|copper sulfate]], elemental [[sulfur]] and [[Ivermectin]]. [[Genetically modified organism]]s, [[nanomaterials]], human sewage [[sludge]], [[plant growth regulator]]s, [[hormone]]s, and [[antibiotic use in ]] husbandry are prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/19528/1/Paull2011NanoISOFAR.pdf "Nanomaterials in food and agriculture: The big issue of small matter for organic food and farming"], Proceedings of the Third Scientific Conference of ISOFAR (International Society of Organic Agriculture Research), 28 September – 1 October, Namyangju, Korea., 2:96-99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=9874504b6f1025eb0e6b67cadf9d3b40&amp;rgn=div6&amp;view=text&amp;node=7:3.1.1.9.32.7&amp;idno=7|title=USDA List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances in Organic Agriculture|date=4 April 2016|website=USDA List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances in Organic Agriculture|publisher=USDA|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for advocation of organic farming include advantages in [[sustainability]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arsenault|first1=Chris|title=Only 60 Years of Farming Left If Soil Degradation Continues|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn_9780930031756"&gt;{{Citation |last=Coleman |first=Eliot |year=1995 |title=The New Organic Grower: A Master's Manual of Tools and Techniques for the Home and Market Gardener |edition=2nd |pages=65, 108 |url= |isbn=978-0930031756 |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[openness]], [[self-sufficiency]], [[autonomy]]/[[independence]],&lt;ref name="isbn_9780930031756"/&gt; [[health]], [[food security]], and [[food safety]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of organic farming}}

[[Traditional agriculture|Agriculture]] was practiced for thousands of years without the use of artificial chemicals. [[Artificial fertilizer]]s were first created during the mid-19th century. These [[Fertilizer#History|early fertilizers]] were cheap, powerful, and easy to transport in bulk. Similar advances occurred in chemical [[pesticide]]s in the 1940s, leading to the decade being referred to as the 'pesticide era'.&lt;ref name=Horne2&gt;{{cite book|last=Horne|first=Paul Anthony|title=Integrated pest management for crops and pastures|year=2008|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|isbn=978-0-643-09257-0|page=2|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=dhO4HAQbNU8C|page=2}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new agricultural techniques, while beneficial in the short term, had serious longer term side effects such as [[soil compaction]], [[soil erosion|erosion]], and declines in overall [[soil fertility]], along with health concerns about toxic chemicals entering the food supply.&lt;ref name=Stinner2007&gt;{{Cite book |year=2007 |last=Stinner, D.H |chapter=The Science of Organic Farming |editor=William Lockeretz |title=Organic Farming: An International History |publisher=Oxfordshire, UK &amp; Cambridge, Massachusetts: CAB International (CABI) |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=25QnL3-njZQC%22Organic}} |access-date=30 April 2013|isbn=978-1-84593-289-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} In the late 1800s and early 1900s, soil biology scientists began to seek ways to remedy these side effects while still maintaining higher production.

In 1921, [[Sir Albert Howard|Albert Howard]] and his wife [[Gabrielle Howard]], accomplished [[botanist]]s, founded an Institute of Plant Industry to improve traditional farming methods in India. Among other things, they brought improved implements and improved animal husbandry methods from their scientific training; then by incorporating aspects of the local traditional methods, developed protocols for the rotation of crops, erosion prevention techniques, and the systematic use of composts and manures.&lt;ref&gt;Yeshwant D. Wad, [http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/howard_memorial.html The Work At Indore]&lt;/ref&gt; Stimulated by these experiences of traditional farming, when Albert Howard returned to Britain in the early 1930s&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle Howard had died while the Howards were still in India.&lt;/ref&gt; he began to promulgate a system of natural agriculture.

In July 1939, [[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]], the author of the standard work on biodynamic agriculture (''Bio-Dynamic Farming and Gardening''),&lt;ref name=Paull2011&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paull, John |year=2011 |title=Biodynamic Agriculture: The Journey from Koberwitz to the World, 1924-1938|url=http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:304a24bf-3961-4798-b13c-9e0a1e2aa339|journal=Journal of Organic Systems |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=27–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to the UK at the invitation of [[Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne]] as a presenter at the [[Betteshanger]] Summer School and Conference on Biodynamic Farming at Northbourne's farm in Kent.&lt;ref name=Betteshanger&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/19511/1/Paull2011BetteshangerJOS.pdf "The Betteshanger Summer School: Missing link between biodynamic agriculture and organic farming"], Journal of Organic Systems, 6(2):13-26.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the chief purposes of the conference was to bring together the proponents of various approaches to organic agriculture in order that they might cooperate within a larger movement. Howard attended the conference, where he met Pfeiffer.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenfried E. Pfeiffer, [http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/howard_memorial.html Sir Albert Howard's Deed for Science]&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, Northbourne published his manifesto of organic farming, ''Look to the Land'', in which he coined the term "organic farming." The Betteshanger conference has been described as the 'missing link' between biodynamic agriculture and other forms of organic farming.&lt;ref name=Betteshanger/&gt;

In 1940 Howard published his ''An Agricultural Testament''. In this book he adopted Northbourne's terminology of "organic farming."&lt;ref name=Paull&gt;Paull, John (2006) [http://orgprints.org/10138/1/10138.pdf The Farm as Organism: The Foundational Idea of Organic Agriculture] Elementals ~ Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania 83:14–18&lt;/ref&gt; Howard's work spread widely, and he became known as the "father of organic farming" for his work in applying scientific knowledge and principles to various traditional and natural methods.&lt;ref name=Stinner2007/&gt;{{rp|45}} In the United States [[Jerome Irving Rodale|J.I. Rodale]], who was keenly interested both in Howard's ideas and in biodynamics,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Heckman, [http://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/a-history-of-organic-farming-transitions-from-sir-albert-howards-war-in-the-soil-to-the-usda-national-organic-program/ A History of Organic Farming: Transitions from Sir Albert Howard’s War in the Soil to the USDA National Organic Program]&lt;/ref&gt; founded in the 1940s both a working organic farm for trials and experimentation, [[The Rodale Institute]], and the [[Rodale Press]] to teach and advocate organic methods to the wider public. These became important influences on the spread of organic agriculture. Further work was done by [[Lady Eve Balfour]] (the [[Haughley Experiment]]) in the United Kingdom, and many others across the world.

Increasing environmental awareness in the general population in modern times has transformed the originally supply-driven organic movement to a demand-driven one. Premium prices and some government subsidies attracted farmers. In the developing world, many producers farm according to traditional methods that are comparable to organic farming, but not certified, and that may not include the latest scientific advancements in organic agriculture. In other cases, farmers in the developing world have converted to modern organic methods for economic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John [http://orgprints.org/10949/01/10949.pdf "China's Organic Revolution"], Journal of Organic Systems (2007) 2 (1): 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
Biodynamic agriculturists, who based their work on Steiner's spiritually-oriented [[anthroposophy]], used the term "organic" to indicate that a farm should be viewed as a living organism,&lt;ref name=Kirchmann/&gt;{{rp|17–19}}&lt;ref name=Betteshanger/&gt; in the sense of the following quotation:
{{quote|1="An organic farm, properly speaking, is not one that uses certain methods and substances and avoids others; it is a farm whose structure is formed in imitation of the structure of a natural system that has the integrity, the independence and the benign dependence of an organism"
| 2=[[Wendell Berry]], "The Gift of Good Land"}}

The use of "organic" popularized by Howard and Rodale, on the other hand, refers more narrowly to the use of [[Soil organic matter|organic matter]] derived from plant compost and animal manures to improve the [[humus]] content of soils, grounded in the work of early soil scientists who developed what was then called "humus farming." Since the early 1940s the two camps have tended to merge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nayler|first=Justin|title=Second Thoughts About Organic Agriculture|url=http://www.soilandhealth.org/01aglibrary/Second.Thoughts.pdf|publisher=Soil And Health Library|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Diver|first=Steve|title=Controlled Microbial Composting and Humus Management: Luebke Compost|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/steved/Luebke/Luebke-compost2.html|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic farming methods combine scientific knowledge of ecology and modern [[technology]] with [[Traditional agriculture|traditional farming]] practices based on naturally occurring biological processes. Organic farming methods are studied in the field of [[agroecology]]. While conventional agriculture uses synthetic pesticides and water-soluble synthetically purified fertilizers, organic farmers are restricted by regulations to using natural pesticides and fertilizers. An example of a natural pesticide is [[pyrethrin]], which is found naturally in the [[Chrysanthemum]] flower. The principal methods of organic farming include [[crop rotation]], [[green manure]]s and [[compost]], [[biological pest control]], and mechanical [[Tillage|cultivation]]. These measures use the natural environment to enhance agricultural productivity: [[legumes]] are planted to fix [[nitrogen]] into the soil, [[predation|natural insect predators]] are encouraged, crops are rotated to confuse pests and renew soil, and natural materials such as [[potassium bicarbonate]]&lt;ref&gt;FiBL (2006) [http://www.betriebsmittelliste.ch/fileadmin/documents/de/hifu/stellungnahmen/potassium_bicarbonate_organic.pdf Use of potassium bicarbonate as a fungicide in organic farming]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mulch]]es are used to control disease and [[weed]]s. [[Genetically modified organism|Genetically modified]] seeds and animals are excluded.

While organic is fundamentally different from conventional because of the use of carbon based fertilizers compared with highly soluble synthetic based fertilizers and [[biological pest control]] instead of synthetic pesticides, organic farming and large-scale conventional farming are not entirely mutually exclusive. Many of the methods developed for organic agriculture have been borrowed by more conventional agriculture. For example, [[Integrated Pest Management]] is a multifaceted strategy that uses various organic methods of pest control whenever possible, but in conventional farming could include synthetic [[pesticides]] only as a last resort.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{cite web | title =Integrated Pest Management | work = | publisher =U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | url =http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/tipm.html | doi = | accessdate =1 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crop diversity ===

Organic farming encourages [[Crop diversity]]. The science of [[agroecology]] has revealed the benefits of [[polyculture]] (multiple crops in the same space), which is often employed in organic farming.&lt;ref&gt;Fargione J, and D Tilman. 2002. "[http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/biblio/fulltext/t1868.pdf Competition and coexistence in terrestrial plants]". Pages 156-206 In U. Sommer and B Worm editors, ''Competition and Coexistence''. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; Planting a variety of vegetable crops supports a wider range of beneficial insects, soil microorganisms, and other factors that add up to overall farm health. Crop diversity helps environments thrive and protects species from going extinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wunderground.com/blog/organicfarmingblog/crop-diversity-a-distinctive-characteristic-of-an-organic-farming-met Crop diversity: A Distinctive Characteristic of an Organic Farming Method] - Organic Farming; 15 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soil managements ===

Organic farming relies heavily on the natural breakdown of organic matter, using techniques like [[green manure]] and [[composting]], to replace nutrients taken from the soil by previous crops. This biological process, driven by [[microorganism]]s such as [[mycorrhiza]], allows the natural production of nutrients in the soil throughout the growing season, and has been referred to as ''feeding the soil to feed the plant.'' Organic farming uses a variety of methods to improve soil fertility, including crop rotation, cover cropping, reduced tillage, and application of compost. By reducing tillage, soil is not inverted and exposed to air; less carbon is lost to the atmosphere resulting in more soil organic carbon. This has an added benefit of carbon sequestration, which can reduce green house gases and help reverse climate change.

Plants need [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[potassium]], as well as [[micronutrient]]s and [[symbiotic relationship]]s with [[fungi]] and other organisms to flourish, but getting enough nitrogen, and particularly synchronization so that plants get enough nitrogen at the right time (when plants need it most), is a challenge for organic farmers.&lt;ref name=SoilFertility&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Watson CA, Atkinson D, Gosling P, Jackson LR, Rayns FW | title = Managing soil fertility in organic farming systems | year = 2002 | journal = Soil Use and Management | pages = 239–247| volume = 18 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-2743.2002.tb00265.x }} [http://orgprints.org/8060/ Preprint with free full-text].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crop rotation]] and [[green manure]] ("[[cover crop]]s") help to provide nitrogen through [[legume]]s (more precisely, the ''[[Fabaceae]]'' family), which fix nitrogen from the atmosphere through symbiosis with [[rhizobia]]l [[bacteria]]. [[Intercropping]], which is sometimes used for insect and disease control, can also increase soil nutrients, but the competition between the legume and the crop can be problematic and wider spacing between crop rows is required. [[Crop residue]]s can be [[plough]]ed back into the soil, and different plants leave different amounts of nitrogen, potentially aiding synchronization.&lt;ref name=SoilFertility/&gt; Organic farmers also use animal [[manure]], certain processed fertilizers such as seed meal and various [[mineral]] powders such as [[rock phosphate]] and [[Greensand (geology)|green sand]], a naturally occurring form of [[potash]] that provides potassium. Together these methods help to control [[erosion]]. In some cases [[pH]] may need to be amended. Natural pH amendments include [[Agricultural lime|lime]] and [[sulfur]], but in the U.S. some compounds such as [[Iron(II) sulfate|iron sulfate]], [[aluminum sulfate]], [[magnesium sulfate]], and soluble [[boron]] products are allowed in organic farming.&lt;ref name=Gillman2008/&gt;{{Rp|43}}

Mixed farms with both [[livestock]] and [[Tillage|crops]] can operate as [[ley farming|ley farms]], whereby the land gathers fertility through growing nitrogen-fixing [[forage]] grasses such as [[white clover]] or [[alfalfa]] and grows [[cash crop]]s or [[cereal]]s when fertility is established. Farms without livestock ("stockless") may find it more difficult to maintain soil fertility, and may rely more on external inputs such as imported [[manure]] as well as grain legumes and green manures, although grain legumes may fix limited nitrogen because they are harvested. [[Horticulture|Horticultural]] farms that grow fruits and vegetables in protected conditions often rely even more on external inputs.&lt;ref name=SoilFertility/&gt;

Biological research into soil and soil organisms has proven beneficial to organic farming. Varieties of bacteria and fungi break down chemicals, plant matter and animal waste into productive soil nutrients. In turn, they produce benefits of healthier yields and more productive soil for future crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=298–312|last=Ingram |first=M. |year=2007 |title=Biology and Beyond: The Science of ''Back to Nature'' Farming in the United States |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=97 |issue=2 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8306.2007.00537.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fields with less or no manure display significantly lower yields, due to decreased soil microbe community. Increased manure improves biological activity, providing a healthier, more arable soil system and higher yields.&lt;ref name="Fließbach et al. 2006"/&gt;

=== Weed management ===

Organic [[weed]] management promotes weed suppression, rather than weed elimination, by enhancing crop competition and [[phytotoxic]] effects on weeds.&lt;ref name="extension.iastate.edu"&gt;Kathleen Delate and Robert Hartzler. 2003. [http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/PM1883.pdf Weed Management for Organic Farmers]. Iowa State University Extension Bulletin 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; Organic farmers integrate cultural, biological, mechanical, physical and chemical tactics to manage weeds without synthetic herbicides.

Organic standards require [[Crop rotation|rotation]] of annual crops,&lt;ref&gt;Staff, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. [http://193.194.138.42/en/Sustainability-Claims-Portal/Discussion-Forum/Organic-Standards/ Organic Standards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606214740/http://193.194.138.42/en/Sustainability-Claims-Portal/Discussion-Forum/Organic-Standards/ |date=6 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that a single crop cannot be grown in the same location without a different, intervening crop. Organic crop rotations frequently include weed-suppressive [[cover crop]]s and crops with dissimilar life cycles to discourage weeds associated with a particular crop.&lt;ref name="extension.iastate.edu"/&gt; Research is ongoing to develop organic methods to promote the growth of natural microorganisms that suppress the growth or germination of common weeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kremer | first1 = Robert J. | last2 = Li | first2 = Jianmei | year = 2003 | title = Developing weed-suppressive soils through improved soil quality management | url = http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/11123/PDF | journal = Soil &amp; Tillage Research | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 193–202 | doi=10.1016/s0167-1987(03)00088-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cultural practices used to enhance crop competitiveness and reduce weed pressure include selection of competitive crop varieties, high-density planting, tight row spacing, and late planting into warm soil to encourage rapid crop [[germination]].&lt;ref name="extension.iastate.edu"/&gt;

Mechanical and physical weed control practices used on organic farms can be broadly grouped as:&lt;ref name="extension.org"&gt;Mark Schonbeck, Virginia Association for Biological Farming. Last Updated: 23 March 2010.

* [[Tillage]] - Turning the soil between crops to incorporate crop residues and soil amendments; remove existing weed growth and prepare a seedbed for planting; turning soil after seeding to kill weeds, including [[cultivator|cultivation]] of row crops;
* Mowing and cutting - Removing top growth of weeds;
* Flame weeding and thermal weeding - Using heat to kill weeds; and
* [[Mulch]]ing - Blocking weed emergence with organic materials, plastic films, or [[landscape fabric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Szykitka, Walter|title=The Big Book of Self-Reliant Living: Advice and Information on Just About Everything You Need to Know to Live on Planet Earth|publisher=Globe-Pequot|year=2004|isbn=978-1-59228-043-8|page=343|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=E0bb14gPCZsC|page=343}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics, citing work published in 1997 by David Pimentel of Cornell University,&lt;ref&gt;Pimentel D et al.

Some naturally sourced chemicals are allowed for herbicidal use. These include certain formulations of [[acetic acid]] (concentrated vinegar), [[corn gluten meal]], and [[essential oils]]. A few selective [[bioherbicide]]s based on fungal [[pathogen]]s have also been developed. At this time, however, organic herbicides and bioherbicides play a minor role in the organic weed control toolbox.&lt;ref name="extension.org"/&gt;

Weeds can be controlled by grazing. For example, geese have been used successfully to weed a range of organic crops including cotton, strawberries, tobacco, and corn,&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Geiger and Harold Biellier. 1993. [http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G8922 Weeding With Geese]. University of Missouri Extension Bulletin G8922.&lt;/ref&gt; reviving the practice of keeping [[Cotton Patch Goose|cotton patch geese]], common in the southern U.S. before the 1950s. Similarly, some rice farmers introduce ducks and fish to wet [[paddy field]]s to eat both weeds and insects.&lt;ref name="csmonitor.com"&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0220/p11s01-sten.html?s=widep How to feed the world] By Laurent Belsie (edition of 20 February 2003) The Christian Science Monitor&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controlling other organisms ===

[[File:Chloroxylon from India.JPG|thumb|[[Chloroxylon]] is used for Pest Management in Organic Rice Cultivation in Chhattisgarh, India]]
{{See also|Biological pest control|Integrated Pest Management}}

Organisms aside from weeds that cause problems on organic farms include [[arthropod]]s (e.g., insects, [[mite]]s), [[nematode]]s, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[bacteria]]. Organic practices include, but are not limited to:

* encouraging predatory beneficial insects to control pests by serving them nursery plants and/or an alternative habitat, usually in a form of a [[Windbreak|shelterbelt]], [[hedgerow]], or [[beetle bank]];
* encouraging beneficial microorganisms;
* [[crop rotation|rotating crops]] to different locations from year to year to interrupt pest reproduction cycles;
* planting [[companion planting|companion crops]] and [[List of pest-repelling plants|pest-repelling plants]] that discourage or divert pests;
* using row covers to protect crops during pest migration periods;
* using [[Ecologic pesticides and herbicides|biologic pesticides and herbicides]];
* using [[stale seed bed]]s to germinate and destroy weeds before planting;&lt;ref&gt;Presentation by Ilse A. Rasmussen, Dept. of Crop Protection, Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences. [http://orgprints.org/216/02/Elspeet2000_iar.PDF Sowing time, false seedbed, row distance and [[mechanical weed control]] in organic winter wheat]&lt;/ref&gt;
* using sanitation to remove pest habitat;
* using [[insect trap]]s to monitor and control insect populations; and
* using physical barriers, such as [[row cover]]s.

Examples of predatory beneficial insects include [[Orius (bug)|minute pirate bugs]], [[Geocoris|big-eyed bugs]], and to a lesser extent [[Coccinellidae|ladybugs]] (which tend to fly away), all of which eat a wide range of pests. [[Neuroptera|Lacewings]] are also effective, but tend to fly away. [[Praying mantis]] tend to move more slowly and eat less heavily. [[Parasitoid wasp]]s tend to be effective for their selected prey, but like all small insects can be less effective outdoors because the wind controls their movement. Predatory mites are effective for controlling other mites.&lt;ref name=Gillman2008/&gt;{{Rp|66–90}}

Naturally derived [[insecticide]]s allowed for use on organic farms use include ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (a bacterial toxin), [[pyrethrum]] (a chrysanthemum extract), [[spinosad]] (a bacterial metabolite), [[neem]] (a tree extract) and [[rotenone]] (a legume root extract). Fewer than 10% of organic farmers use these pesticides regularly; one survey found that only 5.3% of vegetable growers in California use [[rotenone]] while 1.7% use [[pyrethrum]].&lt;ref name=Lotter2003&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lotter |first1= D. |year=2003 |url=http://donlotter.net/lotter_organicag.pdf| title= Organic Agriculture |journal=Journal of Sustainable Agriculture | volume = 21 |issue=4 |format = PDF|doi=10.1300/J064v21n04_06|page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} These pesticides are not always more safe or environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides and can cause harm.&lt;ref name=Gillman2008&gt;Gillman J.

=== Livestock ===

[[File:Organic cattle in Ohio, United States.jpg|thumb|right|For livestock, like these healthy cows, vaccines play an important part in animal health since antibiotic therapy is prohibited in organic farming]]
Raising livestock and poultry, for meat, dairy and eggs, is another traditional farming activity that complements growing. Organic farms attempt to provide animals with natural living conditions and feed. Organic certification verifies that livestock are raised according to the USDA organic regulations throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5102526}}&lt;/ref&gt; These regulations include the requirement that all animal feed must be certified organic.

Organic livestock may be, and must be, treated with medicine when they are sick, but drugs cannot be used to promote growth, their feed must be organic, and they must be pastured.&lt;ref&gt;FAO [http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload/230124/CXg_032e.pdf Guidelines for the Production, Processing, Labelling and Marketing of Organically Produced Foods (Gl 32 – 1999, Rev. 1 – 2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19ff}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateN&amp;navID=OrganicStandardslinkNOPConsumers&amp;rightNav1=OrganicStandardslinkNOPConsumers&amp;topNav=&amp;leftNav=NationalOrganicProgram&amp;page=NOPOrganicStandards&amp;resultType=&amp;acct=nopgeninfo|title=Organic Standards - Agricultural Marketing Service|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, horses and cattle were once a basic farm feature that provided labor, for hauling and plowing, fertility, through recycling of manure, and fuel, in the form of food for farmers and other animals. While today, small growing operations often do not include livestock, domesticated animals are a desirable part of the organic farming equation, especially for true sustainability, the ability of a farm to function as a self-renewing unit.

=== Genetic modification ===
{{Main|Genetically modified crops|Genetically modified food|Genetically modified food controversies}}

A key characteristic of organic farming is the rejection of genetically engineered plants and animals. On 19 October 1998, participants at IFOAM's 12th Scientific Conference issued the [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements#IFOAM and GMOs|Mar del Plata Declaration]], where more than 600 delegates from over 60 countries voted unanimously to exclude the use of genetically modified organisms in food production and agriculture.

Although opposition to the use of any transgenic technologies in organic farming is strong, agricultural researchers Luis Herrera-Estrella and Ariel Alvarez-Morales continue to advocate integration of [[transgenic]] technologies into organic farming as the optimal means to sustainable agriculture, particularly in the developing world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=The EMBO Journal | volume=2 |date=April 2001 |author1=Luis Herrera-Estrella |author2=Ariel Alvarez-Morales |title=Genetically modified crops: hope for developing countries? |pages=256–258| doi= 10.1093/embo-reports/kve075 |journal=EMBO Reports |pmid=11306538 |issue=4 |pmc=1083872}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does author and scientist [[Pamela Ronald]], who views this kind of [[biotechnology]] as being consistent with organic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=Oxford University Press |date=April 2008 |author1=Pamela Ronald |author2=Raoul Admachak |title=Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics and the Future of Food|isbn=0195301757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although GMOs are excluded from organic farming, there is concern that the pollen from genetically modified crops is increasingly penetrating organic and [[Heirloom plant|heirloom seed stocks]], making it difficult, if not impossible, to keep these genomes from entering the organic food supply. Differing regulations among countries limits the availability of GMOs to certain countries, as described in the article on [[regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms]].

=== Tools ===

Organic farmers use a number of traditional [[farm tools]] to do farming. Due to the goals of [[sustainability]] in organic farming, organic farmers try to minimize their reliance on [[fossil fuels]]. In the developing world on small organic farms tools are normally constrained to hand tools and [[diesel fuel|diesel]] powered water pumps.

== Standards ==
{{Main|Organic certification}}
Standards regulate production methods and in some cases final output for organic agriculture. Standards may be voluntary or legislated. As early as the 1970s private associations certified organic producers. In the 1980s, governments began to produce organic production guidelines. In the 1990s, a trend toward legislated standards began, most notably with the 1991 [[EU-Eco-regulation]] developed for [[European Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/other/l21118_en.htm|title=EUR-Lex - l21118 - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which set standards for 12 countries, and a 1993 UK program. The EU's program was followed by a Japanese program in 2001, and in 2002 the U.S. created the [[National Organic Program]] (NOP).&lt;ref&gt;USDA [http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/NOP/standards.html NOP Program Standards]. Retrieved 2 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007 over 60 countries regulate organic farming ([[#refWorldStats2007|IFOAM 2007:11]]). In 2005 IFOAM created the [[Principles of Organic Agriculture]], an international guideline for certification criteria.&lt;ref&gt;IFOAM. (2005). [http://www.ifoam.org/about_ifoam/standards/norms.html The IFOAM Norms] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210095156/http://www.ifoam.org/about_ifoam/standards/norms.html |date=10 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the agencies accredit certification groups rather than individual farms.

Organic production materials used in and foods are tested independently by the Organic Materials Review Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omri.org/|title=Welcome to the Organic Materials Review Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Composting ===
Using manure as a fertilizer risks contaminating food with animal gut bacteria, including pathogenic strains of E. coli that have caused fatal poisoning from eating organic food.&lt;ref name=newdaily&gt;[http://thenewdaily.com.au/life/eat-drink/2014/08/29/hidden-dangers-organic-food/ Organic food: the hidden dangers that might surprise you]&lt;/ref&gt; To combat this risk, [[USDA]] organic standards require that manure must be sterilized through high temperature [[Composting#Approaches|thermophilic composting]]. If raw animal manure is used, 120 days must pass before the crop is harvested if the final product comes into direct contact with the soil. For products that don't directly contact soil, 90 days must pass prior to harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=11fd57b422b6314d866dc4b02f1a101d;rgn=div5;view=text;node=7:3.1.1.9.30;idno=7;cc=ecfr|title=National Organic Program Regulations|publisher=|access-date=27 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211185453/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=11fd57b422b6314d866dc4b02f1a101d;rgn=div5;view=text;node=7:3.1.1.9.30;idno=7;cc=ecfr|archive-date=11 December 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==

The [[economics]] of organic farming, a subfield of [[agricultural economics]], encompasses the entire process and effects of organic farming in terms of human society, including [[social cost]]s, [[opportunity cost]]s, [[unintended consequence]]s, [[information asymmetries]], and [[economies of scale]]. Although the scope of economics is broad, agricultural economics tends to focus on maximizing yields and efficiency at the farm level. Economics takes an [[anthropocentric]] approach to the value of the natural world: biodiversity, for example, is considered beneficial only to the extent that it is valued by people and increases profits. Some entities such as the [[European Union]] [[subsidy|subsidize]] organic farming, in large part because these countries want to account for the [[externalities]] of reduced water use, reduced water contamination, reduced [[soil erosion]], reduced carbon emissions, increased biodiversity, and assorted other benefits that result from organic farming.&lt;ref name=Misconcept/&gt;

Traditional organic farming is labor and knowledge-intensive whereas conventional farming is capital-intensive, requiring more energy and manufactured inputs.&lt;ref name=Halberg&gt;{{cite book|last=Halberg|first=Niels|title=Global development of organic agriculture: challenges and prospects|year=2006|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-84593-078-3|page=297|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ij-6DO4kk8gC|page=298}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic farmers in California have cited marketing as their greatest obstacle.&lt;ref&gt;Strochlic, R.; Sierra, L. (2007).

=== Geographic producer distribution ===

The markets for organic products are strongest in North America and Europe, which as of 2001 are estimated to have $6 and $8 billion respectively of the $20 billion global market.&lt;ref name=Lotter2003/&gt;{{rp|6}} As of 2007 [[Australasia]] has 39% of the total organic farmland, including Australia's {{convert|11,80,000|ha}} but 97 percent of this land is sprawling [[rangeland]] ([[#refWorldStats2007|2007:35]]). US sales are 20x as much.&lt;ref name=Lotter2003/&gt;{{rp|7}} Europe farms 23 percent of global organic farmland ({{convert|6,900,000|ha||abbr=on}}), followed by Latin America with 19 percent (5.8 million hectares - 14.3 million acres). Asia has 9.5 percent while North America has 7.2 percent. Africa has 3 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Organic farming by country]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Australia,&lt;ref name="Atlas"/&gt; the countries with the most organic farmland are Argentina (3.1 million hectares - 7.7 million acres), China (2.3 million hectares - 5.7 million acres), and the United States (1.6 million hectares - 4 million acres). Much of Argentina's organic farmland is pasture, like that of Australia ([[#refWorldStats2007|2007:42]]). Spain, Germany, Brazil (the world's largest agricultural exporter), Uruguay, and the England follow the United States in the amount of organic land ([[#refWorldStats2007|2007:26]]).

In the European Union ([[EU25#2004 Enlargement|EU25]]) 3.9% of the total utilized agricultural area was used for organic production in 2005. The countries with the highest proportion of organic land were Austria (11%) and Italy (8.4%), followed by the Czech Republic and Greece (both 7.2%). The lowest figures were shown for Malta (0.2%), Poland (0.6%) and Ireland (0.8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Growth ===

Organic agricultural land increased almost fourfold in 15 years, from 11 million hectares in 1999 to 43.7 million hectares in 2014.&lt;ref name="OrgWorldYearbook2016"/&gt; Between 2013 and 2014, organic agricultural land grew by 500,000 hectares worldwide, increasing in every region except Latin America.&lt;ref name="OrgWorldYearbook2016"/&gt;  During this time period, Europe’s organic farmland increased 260,000 hectares to 11.6 million total (+2.3%), Asia’s increased 159,000 hectares to 3.6 million total (+4.7%), Africa’s increased 54,000 hectares to 1.3 million total (+4.5%), and North America’s increased 35,000 hectares to 3.1 million total (+1.1%).&lt;ref name="OrgWorldYearbook2016"/&gt;  As of 2014, the country with the most organic land was Australia (17.2 million hectares), followed by Argentina (3.1 million hectares), and the United States (2.2 million hectares).&lt;ref name=OrgWorldYearbook2016/&gt; Australia's organic land area has increased at a rate of 16.5% per annum for the past eighteen years.&lt;ref name=oamaps&gt;Paull, John &amp; Hennig, Benjamin (2018) [http://www.academia.edu/37851248/Maps_of_Organic_Agriculture_in_Australia Maps of Organic Agriculture in Australia], Journal of Organics. 5 (1): 29–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the number of organic producers grew by almost 270,000, or more than 13%.&lt;ref name=OrgWorldYearbook2016/&gt; By 2014, there were a reported 2.3 million organic producers in the world.&lt;ref name=OrgWorldYearbook2016/&gt; Most of the total global increase took place in the Philippines, Peru, China, and Thailand.&lt;ref name=OrgWorldYearbook2016/&gt;  Overall, the majority of all organic producers are in India (650,000 in 2013), Uganda (190,552 in 2014), Mexico (169,703 in 2013) and the Philippines (165,974 in 2014).&lt;ref name=OrgWorldYearbook2016/&gt;

=== Productivity ===

Studies comparing yields have had mixed results.&lt;ref name="Welsh, Rick 1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Welsh, Rick | title=Economics of Organic Grain and Soybean Production in the Midwestern United States | journal=Henry A. Wallace Institute for Alternative Agriculture | year=1999 | volume= | pages= | url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/134120}}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences among findings can often be attributed to variations between study designs including differences in the crops studied and the methodology by which results were gathered.

A 2012 meta-analysis found that productivity is typically lower for organic farming than conventional farming, but that the size of the difference depends on context and in some cases may be very small.&lt;ref name=Verena2013&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seufert | first1 = Verena | last2 = Ramankutty | first2 = Navin | last3 = Foley | first3 = Jonathan A. | year = 2012 | title = Comparing the yields of organic and conventional agriculture | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7397/full/nature11069.html | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7397| pages = 229–232 | doi=10.1038/nature11069| bibcode = 2012Natur.485..229S }}&lt;/ref&gt; While organic yields can be lower than conventional yields, another meta-analysis published in Sustainable Agriculture Research in 2015, concluded that certain organic on-farm practices could help narrow this gap. Timely weed management and the application of manure in conjunction with legume forages/cover crops were shown to have positive results in increasing organic corn and soybean productivity.

Another meta-analysis published in the journal Agricultural Systems in 2011 analyzed 362 datasets and found that organic yields were on average 80% of conventional yields. The author's found that there are relative differences in this yield gap based on crop type with crops like soybeans and rice scoring higher than the 80% average and crops like wheat and potato scoring lower. Across global regions, Asia and Central Europe were found to have relatively higher yields and Northern Europe relatively lower than the average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Pont|first=Tomek|last2=Rijk|first2=Bert|last3=van Ittersum|first3=Martin K.|date=19 December 2011|title=The crop yield gap between organic and conventional agriculture|url=|journal=Agricultural Systems|doi=10.1016/j.agsy.2011.12.004|pmid=|volume=108|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1742170507001640 |laysource=New Scientist |laydate=12 July 2007 |laysummary=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12245-organic-farming-could-feed-the-world.html |title=Organic agriculture and the global food supply |year=2007 |last1=Badgley |first1=Catherine |last2=Moghtader |first2=Jeremy |last3=Quintero |first3=Eileen |last4=Zakem |first4=Emily |last5=Chappell |first5=M.

The researchers also found that while in developed countries, organic systems on average produce 92% of the yield produced by conventional agriculture, organic systems produce 80% more than conventional farms in developing countries, because the materials needed for organic farming are more accessible than synthetic farming materials to farmers in some poor countries. This study's methodology and results were contested by D.J. Connor of The University of Melbourne, in a short communication published in Field Crops Research.&lt;ref name="Connor2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Connor | first1 = D. J. | year = 2008 | title = Organic agriculture cannot feed the world | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Connor6/publication/228387654_Organic_agriculture_cannot_feed_the_world/links/0c9605322be1a6f027000000.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Field Crops Res. | volume = 106 | issue = | pages = 187–190 | doi=10.1016/j.fcr.2007.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connor writes that errors in Badgley et al. result in "major overestimation of the productivity of OA".

====Long term studies====
A study published in 2005 compared conventional cropping, organic animal-based cropping, and organic legume-based cropping on a test farm at the [[Rodale Institute]] over 22 years.&lt;ref&gt;Pimentel DP et al. (2005) [http://www.ce.cmu.edu/~gdrg/readings/2007/02/20/Pimental_EnvironmentalEnergeticAndEconomicComparisonsOfOrganicAndConventionalFarmingSystems.pdf Environmental, Energetic, and Economic Comparisons of Organic and Conventional Farming Systems] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601032933/http://www.ce.cmu.edu/~gdrg/readings/2007/02/20/Pimental_EnvironmentalEnergeticAndEconomicComparisonsOfOrganicAndConventionalFarmingSystems.pdf |date=1 June 2013 }} Bioscience 55(7): 573-582.&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that "the crop yields for corn and soybeans were similar in the organic animal, organic legume, and conventional farming systems". It also found that "significantly less fossil energy was expended to produce corn in the Rodale Institute’s organic animal and organic legume systems than in the conventional production system. There was little difference in energy input between the different treatments for producing soybeans. In the organic systems, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides were generally not used". As of 2013 the Rodale study was ongoing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rodaleinstitute.org/our-work/farming-systems-trial/|title=Farming Systems Trial: Overview - Rodale Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a thirty-year anniversary report was published by Rodale in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rodaleinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/FSTbookletFINAL.pdf |title=The Farming Systems Trial Rodale 30 year report|accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A long-term field study comparing organic/conventional agriculture carried out over 21 years in Switzerland concluded that "Crop yields of the organic systems averaged over 21 experimental years at 80% of the conventional ones. The fertilizer input, however, was 34 – 51% lower, indicating an efficient production. The organic farming systems used 20 – 56% less energy to produce a
crop unit and per land area this difference was 36 – 53%. In spite of the considerably lower pesticide input the quality of organic products was hardly discernible from conventional analytically and even came off better in food preference trials and picture creating methods"&lt;ref&gt;Fliessbach, et al. ([[Research Institute of Organic Agriculture]]), [http://www.soilace.com/pdf/pon2004/1.Fliessbach.pdf "D-O-K (Biodynamic-Bioorganic-Conventional): Results From 21 Year Old Field Experiment"].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Profitability ===

In the United States, organic farming has been shown to be 2.7 to 3.8 times more profitable for the farmer than conventional farming when prevailing price premiums are taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moyer|first=Jeff|date=2013|title=Perspective on Rodale Institute’s Farming Systems Trial|url=|journal=Crop Management|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, organic farming is between 22 and 35 percent more profitable for farmers than conventional methods, according to a 2015 meta-analysis of studies conducted across five continents.&lt;ref name="Crowder 7611–7616"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crowder|first=David W.|last2=Reganold|first2=John P.|date=16 June 2015|title=Financial competitiveness of organic agriculture on a global scale|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/24/7611|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=112|issue=24|pages=7611–7616|doi=10.1073/pnas.1423674112|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4475942|pmid=26034271|bibcode=2015PNAS..112.7611C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The profitability of organic agriculture can be attributed to a number of factors. First, organic farmers do not rely on synthetic fertilizer and pesticide inputs, which can be costly. In addition, organic foods currently enjoy a price premium over conventionally produced foods, meaning that organic farmers can often get more for their yield.

The price premium for organic food is an important factor in the economic viability of organic farming. In 2013 there was a 100% price premium on organic vegetables and a 57% price premium for organic fruits. These percentages are based on wholesale fruit and vegetable prices, available through the United States Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/organic-prices.aspx|title=USDA Economic Research Service - Organic Prices|last=Greene|first=Catherine|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Price premiums exist not only for organic versus nonorganic crops, but may also vary depending on the venue where the product is sold: farmers' markets, grocery stores, or wholesale to restaurants. For many producers, direct sales at farmers' markets are most profitable because the farmer receives the entire markup, however this is also the most time and labor-intensive approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Organic Pricing and Costs of Production|last=Post|first=Emily|publisher=NCAT|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been signs of organic price premiums narrowing in recent years, which lowers the economic incentive for farmers to convert to or maintain organic production methods.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McBride|first=William D.|last2=Greene|first2=Catherine R.|date=2013|title=Organic Data and Research from the ARMS Survey: Findings on Competitiveness of the Organic Soybean Sector|url=|journal=Crop Management|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from 22 years of experiments at the Rodale Institute found that, based on the current yields and production costs associated with organic farming in the United States, a price premium of only 10% is required to achieve parity with conventional farming.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A separate study found that on a global scale, price premiums of only 5-7% percent were needed to break even with conventional methods.&lt;ref name="Crowder 7611–7616"/&gt; Without the price premium, profitability for farmers is mixed.&lt;ref name="Lotter2003" /&gt;{{rp|11}}

For markets and supermarkets organic food is profitable as well, and is generally sold at significantly higher prices than non-organic food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/business/18organic.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Sticker Shock in the Organic Aisles |last=Martin|first=Andrew|author2=Kim Severson |date=18 April 2008|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy efficiency ===

In the most recent assessments of the energy efficiency of organic versus conventional agriculture, results have been mixed regarding which form is more carbon efficient. Organic farm systems have more often than not been found to be more energy efficient, however, this is not always the case. More than anything, results tend to depend upon crop type and farm size.&lt;ref name="Pimental 1983 359–372"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Pimental | title=Energy efficiency of farming systems: Organic and conventional agriculture | journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment | year=1983 | volume=9 | pages=359–372 | doi=10.1016/0167-8809(83)90021-X | last2=Berardi | first2=Gigi | last3=Fast | first3=Sarah | issue=4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive comparison of energy efficiency in grain production, produce yield, and animal husbandry concluded that organic farming had a higher yield per unit of energy over the vast majority of the crops and livestock systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dalgaard | title=A model for fossil energy use in Danish agriculture used to compare organic and conventional farming | journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment | year=2001 | volume=87 | pages=51–65 | doi=10.1016/S0167-8809(00)00297-8 | last2=Halberg | first2=Niels | last3=Porter | first3=John R.|display-authors=etal| url=http://orgprints.org/15521/1/15521.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, two studies - both comparing organically- versus conventionally-farmed apples - declare contradicting results, one saying organic farming is more energy efficient, the other saying conventionally is more efficient.&lt;ref name="Pimental 1983 359–372"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reganold et al. 2001 926–930"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Reganold | title=Sustainability of three apple production systems | journal=Nature |date=April 2001 | volume=410 | pages=926–930 | doi=10.1038/35073574 | pmid=11309616 | last2=Glover | first2=JD | last3=Andrews | first3=PK | last4=Hinman | first4=HR | issue=6831|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has generally been found that the labor input per unit of yield was higher for organic systems compared with conventional production.&lt;ref name="Pimental 1983 359–372"/&gt;

=== Sales and marketing ===

Most sales are concentrated in developed nations. In 2008, 69% of Americans claimed to occasionally buy organic products, down from 73% in 2005. One theory for this change was that consumers were substituting "local" produce for "organic" produce.&lt;ref&gt;CNN. [http://money.cnn.com/2008/04/23/news/companies/organics_backlash/index.htm?postversion=2008042308 Consumer surveys show slipping interest in organic products]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartman-group.com/publications/reports/organic-marketplace/ The Hartman Group Organic Marketplace Reports].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distributors ===

The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] requires that distributors, manufacturers, and processors of organic products be certified by an accredited state or private agency.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/192533/vgs32901.pdf|title=Using Vertically Coordinated Relationships To Overcome Tight Supply in the Organic Market|last=Dimitri|first=Carolyn|last2=Oberholtzer|first2=Lydia|date=October 2008|website=|publisher=USDA|access-date=2016-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518010404/http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/192533/vgs32901.pdf|archive-date=18 May 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, there were 3,225 certified organic handlers, up from 2,790 in 2004.&lt;ref name="ers.usda.gov"&gt;Dimitri, Carolyn, and Lydia Oberholtzer. Marketing U.S. Organic Foods: Recent Trends From Farms to Consumers. Economic Information Bulletin No. 58. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Economic Research Service.

Organic handlers are often small firms; 48% reported sales below $1 million annually, and 22% between $1 and $5 million per year.&lt;ref name="Oberholtzer"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2008-september/us-organic-handlers-mostly-small,-focus-on-fruit-and-vegetables.aspx#.VxTnWRMrI6h|title=USDA Economic Research Service - U.S. Organic Handlers Mostly Small, Focus on Fruit and Vegetables|last=Oberholtzer|first=Carolyn Dimitri, Lydia|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=2016-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426205152/http://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2008-september/us-organic-handlers-mostly-small,-focus-on-fruit-and-vegetables.aspx#.VxTnWRMrI6h|archive-date=26 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller handlers are more likely to sell to independent natural grocery stores and natural product chains whereas large distributors more often market to natural product chains and conventional supermarkets, with a small group marketing to independent natural product stores.&lt;ref name="ers.usda.gov"/&gt; Some handlers work with conventional farmers to convert their land to organic with the knowledge that the farmer will have a secure sales outlet. This lowers the risk for the handler as well as the farmer. In 2004, 31% of handlers provided technical support on organic standards or production to their suppliers and 34% encouraged their suppliers to transition to organic.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Smaller farms often join together in [[cooperative]]s to market their goods more effectively.

93% of organic sales are through conventional and natural food supermarkets and chains, while the remaining 7% of U.S. organic food sales occur through farmers' markets, [[foodservice]]s, and other marketing channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/natural-resources-environment/organic-agriculture/organic-market-overview.aspx|title=USDA Economic Research Service - Organic Market Overview|last=Greene|first=Catherine|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Direct-to-consumer sales ====

In the 2012 Census, direct-to-consumer sales equaled $1.3 billion, up from $812 million in 2002, an increase of 60 percent. The number of farms that utilize direct-to-consumer sales was 144,530 in 2012 in comparison to 116,733 in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sustainableagriculture.net/blog/2012-census-organic-local/|title=2012 Census Drilldown: Organic and Local Food {{!}} National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition|website=sustainableagriculture.net|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct-to-consumer sales include farmers' markets, [[Community-supported agriculture|community supported agriculture]] (CSA), on-farm stores, and roadside farm stands. Some organic farms also sell products direct to retailer, direct to restaurant and direct to institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/138324/err128_2_.pdf|title=Direct and Intermediated Marketing of Local Foods in the United States|last=Low|first=Sarah|date=November 2011|website=|publisher=USDA|access-date=2016-04-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518003010/http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/138324/err128_2_.pdf|archive-date=18 May 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2008 Organic Production Survey, approximately 7% of organic farm sales were direct-to-consumers, 10% went direct to retailers, and approximately 83% went into wholesale markets. In comparison, only 0.4% of the value of convention agricultural commodities were direct-to-consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri, Carolyn, Lydia Oberholtzer, and Michelle Wittenberger. The Role of Contracts in the Organic Supply Chain: 2004 and 2007, EIB-69, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, December 2010. http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/134484/eib69.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518004146/http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/134484/eib69.pdf |date=18 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not all products sold at farmer’s markets are certified organic, this direct-to-consumer avenue has become increasingly popular in local food distribution and has grown substantially since 1994. In 2014, there were 8,284 farmer’s markets in comparison to 3,706 in 2004 and 1,755 in 1994, most of which are found in populated areas such as the Northeast, Midwest, and West Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/detail.aspx?chartId=48561&amp;ref=collection&amp;embed=True|title=Number of U.S. farmers’ markets continues to rise|last=Vogel|first=Stephen|date=August 2014|publisher=USDA|access-date=2016-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426162736/http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/detail.aspx?chartId=48561&amp;ref=collection&amp;embed=True|archive-date=26 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labor and employment ===

Organic production is more labor-intensive than conventional production.&lt;ref name=FAOFAQ&gt;Staff, FAO [http://www.fao.org/organicag/oa-faq/oa-faq5/en/ Organic Agriculture FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;  On the one hand, this increased labor cost is one factor that makes organic food more expensive.&lt;ref name=FAOFAQ/&gt;  On the other hand, the increased need for labor may be seen as an "employment dividend" of organic farming, providing more jobs per unit area than conventional systems.&lt;ref&gt;Green M and Maynard R. [http://orgprints.org/10178/1/The_employment_benefits_of_organic_farming.pdf The employment benefits of organic farming]  Aspects of Applied Biology 79, 2006; 51-55&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report suggests that "[a]n increase in investment in green agriculture is projected to lead to growth in employment of about 60 per cent compared with current levels" and that "green agriculture investments could create 47 million additional jobs compared with BAU2 over the next 40 years."&lt;ref&gt;Citation used: UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) also argues that "[b]y greening agriculture and food distribution, more calories per person per day, more jobs and business opportunities especially in rural areas, and market-access opportunities, especially for developing countries, will be available."

=== World's food security ===

In 2007 the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) said that organic agriculture often leads to higher prices and hence a better income for farmers, so it should be promoted. However, FAO stressed that by organic farming one could not feed the current mankind, even less the bigger future population. Both data and models showed then that organic farming was far from sufficient. Therefore, chemical fertilizers were needed to avoid hunger.&lt;ref name=fao&gt;[http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2007/1000726/index.html Organic agriculture can contribute to fighting hunger - But chemical fertilizers needed to feed the world], [[FAO]], 10 December 2007, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; Other analysis by many agribusiness executives, agricultural and ecological scientists, and international agriculture experts revealed the opinion that organic farming would not only increase the world's food supply, but might be the only way to eradicate hunger.&lt;ref name="Halweil"&gt;{{cite web|last=Halweil|first=Brian|title=Can Organic Farming Feed Us All?|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/4060|publisher=World Watch Magazine|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FAO stressed that fertilizers and other chemical inputs can much increase the production, particularly in Africa where fertilizers are currently used 90% less than in Asia.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; For example, in Malawi the yield has been boosted using seeds and fertilizers.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; FAO also calls for using [[biotechnology]], as it can help smallholder farmers to improve their income and food security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/202820/icode/ Overcoming smallholder challenges with biotechnology], FAO, 29 October 2013, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also [[NEPAD]], development organization of African governments, announced that feeding Africans and preventing malnutrition requires fertilizers and enhanced seeds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100304023531/http://www.africafertilizersummit.org/ Meeting Africa's Food Challenge], The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), 9–13 June 2006, Abuja, Nigeria.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 study in ScienceDigest, organic best management practices shows an average yield only 13% less than conventional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can organic food feed the world? New study sheds light on debate over organic vs. conventional agriculture|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120425140114.htm|publisher=Science Daily|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the world's poorer nations where most of the world's hungry live, and where conventional agriculture's expensive inputs are not affordable by the majority of farmers, adopting organic management actually increases yields 93% on average, and could be an important part of increased food security.&lt;ref name="Halweil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=De Schutter|first=Olivier|title=Report submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food|url=http://3x39fmt0aja34zifjfnu4695x.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/20110308_UN_agroecology_report.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capacity building in developing countries ===

Organic agriculture can contribute to ecological sustainability, especially in poorer countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ICapacity Building Study 3: Organic Agriculture and Food Security in East Africa | publisher = University of Essex | url = http://www.unep-unctad.org/cbtf/events/dsalaam2/Organic%20Agriculture%20and%20Food%20Security%20in%20East%20Africa%20FINAL%20May07.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071201140714/http://www.unep-unctad.org/cbtf/events/dsalaam2/Organic%20Agriculture%20and%20Food%20Security%20in%20East%20Africa%20FINAL%20May07.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-12-01 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of organic principles enables employment of local resources (e.g., local seed varieties, manure, etc.) and therefore cost-effectiveness. Local and international markets for organic products show tremendous growth prospects and offer creative producers and exporters excellent opportunities to improve their income and living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/297145982|title=Going organic : mobilizing networks for environmentally responsible food production|last=Lockie, S.|first=|date=2006|publisher=CABI|others=|isbn=9781845931582|location=Wallingford|pages=|oclc=297145982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic agriculture is knowledge intensive. Globally, capacity building efforts are underway, including localized training material, to limited effect. As of 2007, the [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements]] hosted more than 170 free manuals and 75 training opportunities online.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In 2008 the [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) stated that "organic agriculture can be more conducive to food security in Africa than most conventional production systems, and that it is more likely to be sustainable in the long-term"&lt;ref name=UNEP2008&gt;UNEP-UNCTAD. (2008). Organic Agriculture and Food Security in Africa. United Nations. [http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/ditcted200715_en.pdf Free full-text].&lt;/ref&gt; and that "yields had more than doubled where organic, or near-organic practices had been used" and that soil fertility and drought resistance improved.&lt;ref&gt;Howden D. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/organic-farming-could-feed-africa-968641.html Organic farming 'could feed Africa']. The Independent.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Millennium Development Goals ====

The value of organic agriculture (OA) in the achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDG), particularly in poverty reduction efforts in the face of climate change, is shown by its contribution to both income and non-income aspects of the MDGs. These benefits are expected to continue in the post-MDG era. A series of case studies conducted in selected areas in Asian countries by the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) and published as a book compilation by ADB in Manila document these contributions to both income and non-income aspects of the MDGs. These include poverty alleviation by way of higher incomes, improved farmers' health owing to less chemical exposure, integration of sustainable principles into rural development policies, improvement of access to safe water and sanitation, and expansion of global partnership for development as small farmers are integrated in value chains.&lt;ref name="E&amp;S"&gt;[http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/161042/organic-agriculture-and-post-2015-development-goals.]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} Setboonsarng, S.

A related ADBI study also sheds on the costs of OA programs and set them in the context of the costs of attaining the MDGs. The results show considerable variation across the case studies, suggesting that there is no clear structure to the costs of adopting OA. Costs depend on the efficiency of the OA adoption programs. The lowest cost programs were more than ten times less expensive than the highest cost ones. However, further analysis of the gains resulting from OA adoption reveals that the costs per person taken out of poverty was much lower than the estimates of the World Bank,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;World Bank. 2008.

== Disadvantages ==

Agriculture imposes negative externalities (uncompensated costs) upon society through public land and other public resource use, biodiversity loss, erosion, pesticides, nutrient runoff, subsidized water usage, subsidy payments and assorted other problems. Positive externalities include self-reliance, entrepreneurship, respect for nature, and air quality. Organic methods reduce some of these costs.&lt;ref name=Marshall1991&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Marshall | first = G. | year = 1991 | title= Organic Farming: Should Government Give it More Technical Support? |journal = Review of Marketing and Agricultural Economics | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 283–296 | url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/12390/1/59030283.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 uncompensated costs for 1996 reached 2,343 million British pounds or £208 per ha (£84.20/ac).&lt;ref name=Pretty2000&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Pretty| year = 2000| title = An assessment of the total external costs of UK agriculture| journal = Agricultural Systems| volume = 65| issue = 2| pages = 113–136| doi = 10.1016/S0308-521X(00)00031-7| url = http://www.essex.ac.uk/bs/staff/pretty/AgSyst%20pdf.pdf| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5p4udiKF2?url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/bs/staff/pretty/AgSyst%20pdf.pdf| archivedate = 18 April 2010| first1 = J| last2 = Brett| first2 = C.| last3 = Gee| first3 = D.| last4 = Hine| first4 = R.E.| last5 = Mason| first5 = C.F.| last6 = Morison| first6 = J.I.L.| last7 = Raven| first7 = H.| last8 = Rayment| first8 = M.D.| last9 = Van Der Bijl| first9 = G. &lt;!--exactly 9 authors--&gt;| display-authors = etal| deadurl = yes| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of practices in the US published in 2005 concluded that cropland costs the economy approximately 5 to 16 billion dollars ($30–96/ha – $12–39/ac), while livestock production costs 714 million dollars.&lt;ref name=Tegtmeier2005&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Tegtmeier | first1 = E.M. | last2 = Duffy | first2 = M. | year = 2005 | title = External Costs of Agricultural Production in the United States | journal = The Earthscan Reader in Sustainable Agriculture | url = http://www.organicvalley.coop/fileadmin/pdf/ag_costs_IJAS2004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both studies recommended reducing externalities. The 2000 review included reported pesticide poisonings but did not include speculative chronic health effects of pesticides, and the 2004 review relied on a 1992 estimate of the total impact of pesticides.

It has been proposed that organic agriculture can reduce the level of some negative externalities from (conventional) agriculture. Whether the benefits are private or public depends upon the division of property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= New Zealand's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry | title= A Review of the Environmental/Public Good Costs and Benefits of Organic Farming and an Assessment of How Far These Can be Incorporated into Marketable Benefits | work=  | url= http://www.maf.govt.nz/mafnet/rural-nz/sustainable-resource-use/organic-production/organic-farming-in-nz/org10005.htm | accessdate= 20 April 2008 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081015111550/http://www.maf.govt.nz/mafnet/rural-nz/sustainable-resource-use/organic-production/organic-farming-in-nz/org10005.htm | archivedate= 15 October 2008 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several surveys and studies have attempted to examine and compare conventional and organic systems of farming and have found that organic techniques, while not without harm, are less damaging than conventional ones because they reduce levels of biodiversity less than conventional systems do and use less energy and produce less waste when calculated per unit area.&lt;ref&gt;Stolze, M.; Piorr, A.; Häring, A.M. and Dabbert, S.

A 2003 to 2005 investigation by the [[Cranfield University]] for the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] in the UK found that it is difficult to compare the [[Global warming potential]], acidification and eutrophication emissions but "Organic production often results in increased burdens, from factors such as N leaching and N2O emissions", even though primary energy use was less for most organic products. N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is always the largest global warming potential contributor except in tomatoes. However, "organic tomatoes always incur more burdens (except pesticide use)". Some emissions were lower "per area", but organic farming always required 65 to 200% more field area than non-organic farming. The numbers were highest for bread wheat (200+ % more) and potatoes (160% more).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.organicagcentre.ca/ResearchDatabase/res_enviro_burdens.asp Determining the environmental burdens and resource use in the production of agricultural and horticultural commodities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329093718/http://www.organicagcentre.ca/ResearchDatabase/res_enviro_burdens.asp |date=29 March 2014 }}, Williams, A.G. et al., Cranfield University, U.K., August 2006.

Proponents of organic farming have claimed that organic agriculture emphasizes closed nutrient cycles, biodiversity, and effective soil management providing the capacity to mitigate and even reverse the effects of [[climate change]]&lt;ref&gt;Meleca (2008).

Critics of organic farming methods believe that the increased land needed to farm organic food could potentially destroy the rainforests and wipe out many ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Goldberg, Bob | title= The Hypocrisy of Organic Farmers | work=AgBioWorld | url=http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/articles/biotech-art/hypocrisy.html | accessdate=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Leonard, Andrew | title= Save the rain forest -- boycott organic? | work=How The World Works | url=https://www.salon.com/2006/12/11/borlaug/ | accessdate=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nutrient leaching ===

According to a 2012 [[meta-analysis]] of 71 studies, nitrogen leaching, nitrous oxide emissions, ammonia emissions, eutrophication potential and acidification potential were higher for organic products,&lt;ref name=tuomisto/&gt; although in one study "nitrate leaching was 4.4–5.6 times higher in conventional plots than organic plots".&lt;ref name="PNAS 2006-3-21"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0600359103|last1=Kramer|first1=SB|last2=Reganold|first2=JP|last3=Glover |first3=JD|last4=Bohannan|first4=BJ|last5=Mooney|first5=HA|title=Reduced nitrate leaching and enhanced dentrifier activity and efficiency in organically fertilized soils|publisher=[[United States National Academy of Sciences]]|pages=4522–7|issue=12|volume=103 |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|date=21 March 2006|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/103/12/4522#B2|accessdate=30 September 2007|pmid=16537377|pmc=1450204 |bibcode=2006PNAS..103.4522K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excess nutrients in lakes, rivers, and groundwater can cause [[algal blooms]], [[eutrophication]], and subsequent [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]]. In addition, [[nitrate]]s are harmful to aquatic organisms by themselves.&lt;ref name="Science 2001-04-13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Forecasting Agriculturally Driven Global Climate Change|journal=Science|date=21 March 2006 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/292/5515/281?ijkey=bbb4cf6e526430899ecae63af4bbd319d226922e&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha|accessdate=30 September 2007|pmid=11303102|doi=10.1126/science.1057544|last1=Tilman|first1=D|last2=Fargione|first2=J|last3=Wolff|first3=B|last4=d'Antonio|first4=C|last5=Dobson|first5=A|last6=Howarth|first6=R|last7=Schindler|first7=D|last8=Schlesinger|first8=WH|last9=Simberloff|first9=D|volume=292|issue=5515|pages=281–4 |bibcode = 2001Sci...292..281T|last10=Swackhamer|first10=D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Land use ===

The Oxford meta-analysis of 71 studies found that organic farming requires 84% more land for an equivalent amount of harvest, mainly due to lack of nutrients but sometimes due to weeds, diseases or pests, lower yielding animals and land required for fertility building crops.&lt;ref name=tuomisto/&gt; While organic farming does not necessarily save land for wildlife habitats and forestry in all cases,&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; the most modern breakthroughs in organic are addressing these issues with success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rodale Institute Farming Systems Trial|url=http://rodaleinstitute.org/our-work/farming-systems-trial/farming-systems-trial-30-year-report/|publisher=Rodale Institute|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Undersander|first=Dan|title=Pastures for Profit: A Guide to Rotational Grazing|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/A3529.PDF|work=University of Wisconsin|publisher=Cooperative extension publishing|accessdate=24 February 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Undersander|first=Dan|title=Grassland Birds: Fostering Habitats Using Rotational Grazing|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/a3715.pdf|work=University of Wisconsin|publisher=Cooperative extension publishing|accessdate=24 February 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pesticides ===
{{expand section|need content and sources on externalities of pesticide use in organic farming|date=March 2015}}
[[File:Organic Apples Pateros WA cropped.jpg|thumb|A sign outside of an organic [[apple]] orchard in [[Pateros, Washington]] reminding orchardists not to spray pesticides on these trees]]

In organic farming synthetic pesticides are generally prohibited. A chemical is said to be synthetic if it does not already exist in the natural world. But the organic label goes further and usually prohibit compounds that exist in nature if they are produced by [[chemical synthesis]]. So the prohibition is also about the method of production and not only the nature of the compound.

A non-exhaustive list of organic approved pesticides with their [[median lethal dose]]s:

* [[Copper(II) sulfate]] is used as a fungicide and is also used in conventional agriculture ([[Copper(II) sulfate|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 300 mg/kg]]). Conventional agriculture has the option to use the less toxic [[Mancozeb]] ([http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/haloxyfop-methylparathion/mancozeb-ext.html LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 4,500 to 11,200 mg/kg])
* [[Boric acid]] is used as stomach poison that target insects  (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 2660&amp;nbsp;mg/kg).
* [[Pyrethrin]] comes from chemicals extracted from flowers of the genus [[Pyrethrum]] ([http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/pyrethrins-ziram/pyrethrins-ext.html LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 370 mg/kg]). Its potent toxicity is used to control insects.
* [[Lime sulphur]] (aka calcium polysulfide) and sulfur are considered to be allowed, synthetic materials&lt;ref&gt;http://web.pppmb.cals.cornell.edu/resourceguide/pdf/resource-guide-for-organic-insect-and-disease-management.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 820&amp;nbsp;mg/kg)
* [[Rotenone]] is a powerful insecticide that was used to control insects (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 132&amp;nbsp;mg/kg). Despite the high toxicity of Rotenone to aquatic life and some links to Parkinson disease the compound is still allowed in organic farming as it is a naturally occurring compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/rotenone-organic-zb0z1405zsto.aspx|title=Use and Status of Rotenone in Organic Growing - Organic Gardening |publisher=MOTHER EARTH NEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bromomethane]] is a gas that is still used in the nurseries of Strawberry organic farming&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/tomorrowstable/2011/09/25/organic-strawberries-are-not-g/|title=What makes an organically grown strawberry environmentally friendly? |publisher=Tomorrow's Table}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Azadirachtin]] is a wide spectrum very potent insecticide. Almost non toxic to mammals (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; in rats is &gt; 3,540&amp;nbsp;mg/kg) but affects beneficial insects.

=== Food quality and safety ===
{{Main|Organic food}}
While there may be some differences in the amounts of nutrients and anti-nutrients when organically produced food and conventionally produced food are compared, the variable nature of food production and handling makes it difficult to generalize results, and there is insufficient evidence to make claims that organic food is safer or healthier than conventional food.&lt;ref name=2014meta&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barański|first1=M|last2=Srednicka-Tober|first2=D|last3=Volakakis|first3=N|last4=Seal|first4=C|last5=Sanderson|first5=R|last6=Stewart|first6=GB|last7=Benbrook|first7=C|last8=Biavati|first8=B|last9=Markellou|first9=E|last10=Giotis|first10=C|last11=Gromadzka-Ostrowska|first11=J|last12=Rembiałkowska|first12=E|last13=Skwarło-Sońta |first13=K|last14=Tahvonen |first14=R|last15=Janovská|first15=D |last16=Niggli|first16=U|last17=Nicot|first17=P |last18=Leifert|first18=C |title=Higher antioxidant and lower cadmium concentrations and lower incidence of pesticide residues in organically grown crops: a systematic literature review and meta-analyses.|journal=The British Journal of Nutrition|date=26 June 2014|pages=1–18|pmid=24968103 |doi=10.1017/S0007114514001366 |volume=112 |issue=5 |pmc=4141693}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blair1"&gt;Blair, Robert.

=== Biodiversity ===
{{Main|Organic farming and biodiversity}}

The conservation of natural resources and biodiversity is a core principle of organic production. Three broad management practices (prohibition/reduced use of chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilizers; sympathetic management of non-cropped habitats; and preservation of mixed farming) that are largely intrinsic (but not exclusive) to organic farming are particularly beneficial for farmland wildlife.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Using practices that attract or introduce beneficial insects, provide habitat for birds and mammals, and provide conditions that increase soil biotic diversity serve to supply vital ecological services to organic production systems. Advantages to certified organic operations that implement these types of production practices include: 1) decreased dependence on outside fertility inputs; 2) reduced pest management costs; 3) more reliable sources of clean water; and 4) better pollination.&lt;ref name="Agricultural Marketing Service 2016"&gt;"USDSA Guidance Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation"(PDF).

Given the broad scope of natural resources which includes soil, water, wetland, woodland and wildlife, the guidance provides examples of practices that support the underlying conservation principles and demonstrate compliance with USDA organic regulations § 205.200.&lt;ref name="Agricultural Marketing Service 2016"/&gt; The final guidance provides organic certifiers and farms with examples of production practices that support conservation principles and comply with the USDA organic regulations, which require operations to maintain or improve natural resources.&lt;ref name="Agricultural Marketing Service 2016"/&gt; The final guidance also clarifies the role of certified operations (to submit an OSP to a certifier), certifiers (ensure that the OSP describes or lists practices that explain the operator's monitoring plan and practices to support natural resources and biodiversity conservation), and inspectors (onsite inspection) in the implementation and verification of these production practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/NOP%205020%20Biodiversity%20Guidance%20Rev01%20%28Final%29.pdf|title=USDSA Guidance Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation|date=15 January 2016|website=Agricultural Marketing Service, National Organic Program|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|access-date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide range of organisms benefit from organic farming, but it is unclear whether organic methods confer greater benefits than conventional integrated agri-environmental programs.&lt;ref name="Hole et al. 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Does organic farming benefit biodiversity? |journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 122 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–130 | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2004.07.018 |last1=Hole |first1=D.G. |last2=Perkins |first2=A.J. |last3=Wilson |first3=J.D. |last4=Alexander |first4=I.H. |last5=Grice |first5=P.V. |last6=Evans |first6=A.D. |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organic farming is often presented as a more biodiversity-friendly practice, but the generality of the beneficial effects of organic farming is debated as the effects appear often species- and context-dependent, and current research has highlighted the need to quantify the relative effects of local- and landscape-scale management on farmland biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four key issues when comparing the impacts on biodiversity of organic and conventional farming: (1) It remains unclear whether a holistic whole-farm approach (i.e. organic) provides greater benefits to biodiversity than carefully targeted prescriptions applied to relatively small areas of cropped and/or non-cropped habitats within conventional agriculture (i.e. agri-environment schemes); (2) Many comparative studies encounter methodological problems, limiting their ability to draw quantitative conclusions; (3) Our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming in pastoral and upland agriculture is limited; (4) There remains a pressing need for longitudinal, system-level studies in order to address these issues and to fill in the gaps in our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming, before a full appraisal of its potential role in biodiversity conservation in agroecosystems can be made.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hole|first1=D.G.|last2=Perkins|first2=A.J.|last3=Wilson|first3=J.D.|last4=Alexander|first4=I.H.|last5=Grice|first5=P.V.|last6=Evans|first6=A.D.|title=Does organic farming benefit biodiversity?|journal=Biological Conservation|date=March 2005|volume=122|issue=1|pages=113–130|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.07.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition to Labor Standards ===
Organic agriculture is often considered to be more socially just and economically sustainable for farmworkers than conventional agriculture. However, there is little social science research or consensus as to whether or not organic agriculture provides better working conditions than conventional agriculture.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shreck|first=Aimee|last2=Getz|first2=Christy|last3=Feenstra|first3=Gail|date=2006-11-21|title=Social sustainability, farm labor, and organic agriculture: Findings from an exploratory analysis|journal=Agriculture and Human Values|volume=23|issue=4|pages=439–449|doi=10.1007/s10460-006-9016-2|issn=0889-048X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many consumers equate organic and sustainable agriculture with small-scale, family-owned organizations it is widely interpreted that buying organic supports better conditions for farmworkers than buying with conventional producers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Getz|first=Christy|last2=Brown|first2=Sandy|last3=Shreck|first3=Aimee|date=December 2008|title=Class Politics and Agricultural Exceptionalism in California's Organic Agriculture Movement|journal=Politics &amp; Society|volume=36|issue=4|pages=478–507|doi=10.1177/0032329208324709|issn=0032-3292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organic agriculture is generally more labor-intensive due to its dependence on manual practices for fertilization and pest removal and relies heavily upon hired, non-family farmworkers rather than family members. Although illnesses from synthetic inputs pose less of a risk, hired workers still fall victim to debilitating musculoskeletal disorders associated with agricultural work. The USDA certification requirements outline growing practices and ecological standards but do nothing to codify labor practices. Independent certification initiatives such as the Agricultural Justice Project, Domestic Fair Trade Working Group, and the Food Alliance have attempted to implement farmworker interests but because these initiatives require voluntary participation of organic farms, their standards cannot be widely enforced.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Sandy|last2=Getz|first2=Christy|date=May 2008|title=Privatizing farm worker justice: Regulating labor through voluntary certification and labeling|journal=Geoforum|volume=39|issue=3|pages=1184–1196|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2007.01.002|issn=0016-7185}}&lt;/ref&gt;Despite the benefit to farmworkers of implementing labor standards, there is little support among the organic community for these social requirements. Many actors of the organic industry believe that enforcing labor standards would be unnecessary&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;, unacceptable&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;, or unviable due to the constraints of the market.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Thailand ===
In Thailand, the Institute for Sustainable Agricultural Communities (ISAC) was established in 1991 to promote organic farming (among other sustainable agricultural practices). The national target via the National Plan for Organic Farming is to attain, by 2021, 1.3 million rai of organically farmed land. Another target is for 40% of the produce from these farmlands to be consumed domestically.&lt;ref name="chiangmaicitylife.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chiangmaicitylife.com/citylife-articles/thailands-organic-concerns-understanding-the-complexities-of-organic-farming-in-thailand/|title=Chiang Mai Citylife - Thailand’s Organic Concerns: Understanding the complexities of Organic Farming in Thailand|website=www.chiangmaicitylife.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9418">The '''Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[right-wing]] movement, established in 1925 to provide volunteers in the event of a [[general strike]]. During the [[General Strike of 1926]], it was taken over by the government to provide vital services, such as transport and communications.

==Prelude==
On "[[Red Friday]]", 31 July 1925, the government avoided a confrontation with the [[Miners Federation of Great Britain]], which was expected to be followed by secondary [[industrial action]] by the railwaymen of the [[National Union of Railwaymen]], and wider confrontation. However, as [[Stanley Baldwin]] said later, "we were not ready". The government had an emergency plan but inadequate means of implementing it. It thus established a [[Royal Commission]] and provided a subsidy to enable the mineowners to maintain the miners' existing wages and hours of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renshaw |1975 |pp= 122–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mason |1969 |p= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early August, [[Home Secretary]] [[William Joynson-Hicks, 1st Viscount Brentford|William Joynson-Hicks]] reported to the cabinet on the state of preparations, and his recommendations were approved, but the establishment of a volunteer service was deferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips | 1976|p= 95}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The OMS had its public origins in the letters page of ''[[The Times]]'', where many were calling for the formation of a volunteer organisation to take over the jobs of striking workers, in the event of a [[general strike]], which was widely feared by the [[conservatism|conservative]] establishment at the time, as part of a '[[communism|communist]] plot'. The same page was used on 25 September 1925 by the Home Secretary to announce the formation of just such a group, the new OMS.&lt;ref name="Perkins70"&gt;{{harvnb|Perkins| 2006| p= 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he admitted, on 1 October, that he had known of its inauguration for many weeks and that its promoters had consulted him. The government had no objection to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Page Arnot |1926 |p= 54}}  &lt;/ref&gt;  

The organisation, to be run by a committee chaired by [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Lord Hardinge]], was to have branches in every city and to recruit volunteers in five classes, four of which were based on the men's fitness and age. The fifth was for women, who were to be set to work only where they could avoid any "rough handling".&lt;ref name="Perkins70"/&gt; [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Lord Jellicoe]] and other top military men sat on the committee, to give the OMS a military discipline and to instill public confidence in the group that such important figures were involved.&lt;ref name="Renshaw130"&gt;{{harvnb|Renshaw |1975|pp= 130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation was, however, explicitly non-political. [[British Fascists]] were barred from joining unless they changed their name, abandoned their military structure and changed their manifesto. That led to a split in the British Fascists, with several leaders leaving to become the ''loyalists'', an organisation that would be absorbed into OMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benewick |1969 |p= 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, it showed apparent independence by employing nobody in government service.&lt;ref name="Renshaw130"/&gt;

==Reaction==
Whilst the scheme was enthusiastically supported by the right-wing ''[[Daily Mail]]'' it was denounced as a form of [[fascism]] not only by the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] but also by the [[anti-communist]] ''[[Daily Express]]'', which compared the OMS to the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the [[Blackshirts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perkins|1971|pp= 70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early speech by one of the group's leaders was deemed unfit for broadcast by the [[BBC]], which feared that it would compromise their impartiality.&lt;ref name="Perkins71"&gt;{{harvnb|Perkins|1971|p= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brigadier-General [[William Horwood (police commissioner)|William Horwood]], the [[Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police]] also refused to work with what he believed to be a fascist organisation, and by the end of 1925 the government had informed General Sir Robert McCalmont that in the event of any general strike, the OMS would be disbanded and its membership taken over entirely by the government.&lt;ref name="Perkins71"/&gt; 

Still, the OMS had the confidence of some provincial police forces and branches of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] despite its inauspicious start.&lt;ref name="Perkins71"/&gt;

==Development==
The development of OMS was not regarded as wholly favourable by some government officials, who were concerned at rumours that OMS agents were expecting to supplant official organisations in the event of an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renshaw|1975|pp=132–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The junior ministers [[William Mitchell-Thomson, 1st Baron Selsdon|William Mitchell-Thomson]] and [[John Davidson, 1st Viscount Davidson|J.C.C. Davidson]] met the leaders of OMS, who agreed not to establish branches where there were local objections, but to encourage unofficial contacts between the local officials.  OMS would concentrate on recruiting lorry drivers rather than those more likely to be employed by local authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips |1976 |pp= 96–7}}  &lt;/ref&gt;  

OMS was short of funds by March 1926, having failed to gain the commercial backing that it hoped.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips |1976 |p= 97}}  &lt;/ref&gt;   It also lacked the means to train volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renshaw |1975 |p=186 }}  &lt;/ref&gt;   
  
==General Strike==
Following the outbreak of the strike and the introduction by the government of emergency powers, it turned over its membership lists to the new government civil commissioners and so became a state organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perkins|1971|p= 114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the OMS name continued to be used, any notion of independence was abandoned, and it became an arm of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renshaw|1975| p= 131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group had some 100,000 members registered at the commencement of the strike, but the middle class of many of its volunteers meant that they often proved wholly unsuited to the manual work, such as the running railways and ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renshaw|1975|pp= 132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It produced slightly over 5000 volunteers. Car drivers, lorry drivers and power station workers were the largest groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips | 1975|p= 134}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It managed to produce the ''[[British Gazette]]'', a pro-government newspaper, during the strike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-o.htm The Cabinet Papers Glossary - O] from [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fascism==
The [[British Fascisti]] (BF), which maintained transport and communications units to be used in the event of a strike, provided an organisational structure for the OMS, but there was uncertainty at government level about allowing BF members to join the OMS given fears about their potentially revolutionary nature.&lt;ref&gt;Dorril, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the BF were allowed to join only if it agreed to renounce fascism and the BF name, which wss rejected by the majority of the group's controlling committee, under [[Rotha Lintorn-Orman]]. The minority faction, led by Brigadier-General [[R.B.D. Blakeney]] and Rear-Admiral A.E. Armstrong, split to form a new group known as the Loyalists (as well as the Scottish Loyalists under the [[Patrick James Boyle, 8th Earl of Glasgow|Earl of Glasgow]]), which was subsumed into the OMS as soon as the strike began.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benewick|1969|p= 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, individual fascists obtained high rank within the OMS. BF member and later co-founder of the [[National Fascisti]] Colonel Ralph Bingham worked along with [[Peter Howard (journalist)|Peter Howard]], who had published a magazine for fascists in [[Ukraine]] and would later be a member of the [[New Party (United Kingdom)|New Party]].

'''''Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution''''' is a 2002 book by [[Francis Fukuyama]]. In it, he discusses the potential threat to [[liberal democracy]] that use of new and emerging [[biotechnologies]] for [[transhumanist]] ends poses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kazin, Michael|authorlink=Michael Kazin|title=Review of ''Our Posthuman Future''|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|volume=47|issue=1|date=Winter 2004|pages=151–152|doi=10.1353/pbm.2004.0012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|newspaper=The Guardian|date=31 May 2002|title=Review of ''Our Posthuman Future''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jun/01/highereducation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the back cover of the paperback edition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A decade after his now-famous pronouncement of "the [[end of history]]", Francis Fukuyama argues that as a result of biomedical advances, we are facing the possibility of a future in which our humanity itself will be altered beyond recognition. Fukuyama sketches a brief history of man's changing understanding of human nature: from Plato and Aristotle's belief that humans had "natural ends" to the ideals of utopians and dictators of the modern age who sought to remake mankind for ideological ends. Fukuyama argues that the ability to manipulate the DNA of all of one person's descendants will have profound, and potentially terrible, consequences for our political order, even if undertaken with the best of intentions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Human Nature ==
Fukuyama defines human nature as "the sum of the behavior and characteristics that are typical of the human species, arising from genetics rather than environmental factors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49502279|title=Our posthuman future : consequences of the biotechnology revolution|last=Francis.|first=Fukuyama,|date=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=0374236437|edition= 1st|location=New York|pages=130|oclc=49502279}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "typicality" is further defined as a statistical phenomenon of the usual distribution of measured parameters describing human characteristics, such the [[normal distribution]] of height or [[Intelligence quotient|intellectual quotient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49502279|title=Our posthuman future : consequences of the biotechnology revolution|last=Francis.|first=Fukuyama,|date=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=0374236437|edition= 1st|location=New York|pages=130–138|oclc=49502279}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author recognizes that distinguishing "pathological" from "normal" is difficult, but insists that drawing the line between the two is not only possible, but is routinely achieved by regulatory agencies through a legislative process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49502279|title=Our posthuman future : consequences of the biotechnology revolution|last=Francis.|first=Fukuyama,|date=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=0374236437|edition= 1st|location=New York|pages=209–210|oclc=49502279}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It has often seemed to me that the only people who can argue that there is no difference in principle between disease and health are those who have never been sick: if you have a virus or fracture your leg, you know perfectly well that something is wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49502279|title=Our posthuman future : consequences of the biotechnology revolution|last=Francis.|first=Fukuyama,|date=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=209|isbn=0374236437|edition= 1st|location=New York|pages=|oclc=49502279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human Dignity ==
Possession of moral choice, human language, reason, sociability, emotions, sentience, and consciousness constitute distinguishing qualities that differentiate humans from animals. Fukuyama refers to the irreducible totality of these qualities as "Factor X", "the complex whole" as opposed to "the sum of simple parts", which forms the foundation of human dignity. Moreover, he believes that "every member of the human species possesses a genetic endowment that allows him or her to become a whole human being, an endowment that distinguishes a human in essence from other types of creatures." Thus, he squarely places the source of human dignity in human genetics providing the argument against unregulated modification of human germline cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49502279|title=Our posthuman future : consequences of the biotechnology revolution|last=Francis.|first=Fukuyama,|date=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=0374236437|edition= 1st|location=New York|pages=170–172|oclc=49502279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuyama argues that the moral status of human embryos is higher than that of human cells or human tissues because they possess "the potential to become a full human being."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49502279|title=Our posthuman future : consequences of the biotechnology revolution|last=Francis.|first=Fukuyama,|date=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=0374236437|edition= 1st|location=New York|pages=176|oclc=49502279}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that "it is therefore reasonable, on non-religious grounds, to question whether researchers should be free to create, clone, and destroy human embryos at will."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Human Rights ==

Francis Fukuyama argues that informed discussion of human rights requires understanding of human purposes, which themselves rest on a concept of human nature and human dignity. Therefore, biotechnology targeting human nature will inevitably affect the discourse of values and politics. He provides several arguments to defend his human nature-based theory of rights: 
# Classic philosophical accounts by Socrates and Plato argue for the existence of human nature. Fukuyama believes that these classic accounts are too easily dismissed by "thoughtless contemporary commentators [who] sneer at Plato's "simplistic" psychology".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49502279|title=Our posthuman future : consequences of the biotechnology revolution|last=Francis.|first=Fukuyama,|date=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=0374236437|edition= 1st|location=New York|pages=118|oclc=49502279}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# The Fallacy of "Naturalistic Fallacy". In response to the assertion that moral obligations cannot be derived from the observation of natural world ("naturalistic fallacy"), Fukuyama demonstrates that humans routinely use emotions to prioritize values. For example, the fear of violent death produces the basic right of life, which some will consider a value higher than the freedom of religion. 
# Inconsistencies in the views of libertarian legal theorists, John Rawls and Ronald Dworkin. For example, Fukuyama shows that John Rawls in "[[A Theory of Justice]]", appeals to apparent observations of human nature, such as genetically programmed social reciprocity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49502279|title=Our posthuman future : consequences of the biotechnology revolution|last=Francis.|first=Fukuyama,|date=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=0374236437|edition= 1st|location=New York|pages=121|oclc=49502279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald Dworkin, on the other hand, also appears to make assumptions about human nature: the existence of distinct natural human potential that can develop over time, efforts needed to cultivate this potential, and desirable choices of an individual regarding her potential.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Some decisions by the US Supreme Court "suggest priorities among the wide variety of human desires and purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49502279|title=Our posthuman future : consequences of the biotechnology revolution|last=Francis.|first=Fukuyama,|date=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=0374236437|edition= 1st|location=New York|pages=123|oclc=49502279}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Fukuyama suggests that the US Supreme Court decision [[Planned Parenthood v. Casey|Casey vs. Planned Parenthood]] defends "moral autonomy as the most important human right."
# Values make collective action possible. "Human beings also find great satisfaction in the fact that values and norms are shared. Solipsistically held values defeat their own purpose and lead to a highly dysfunctional society in which people are unable to work together for common ends."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49502279|title=Our posthuman future : consequences of the biotechnology revolution|last=Francis.|first=Fukuyama,|date=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=0374236437|edition= 1st|location=New York|pages=125|oclc=49502279}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Political history reveals the failure of political regimes which ignored the limits of human nature. For example, Fukuyama concludes that the ultimate failure of communism was caused by its "failure to respect the natural inclination to favor kin and private property."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49502279|title=Our posthuman future : consequences of the biotechnology revolution|last=Francis.|first=Fukuyama,|date=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=0374236437|edition= 1st|location=New York|pages=127|oclc=49502279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political Control of Biotechnology ==
Fukuyama recognizes that translation of human nature into rights is difficult, but possible through a rational discussion of human ends. In his opinion, control of biotechnology is a political necessity. "Countries must regulate the development and use of technology politically, setting up institutions that will discriminate between those technological advances that promote human flourishing, and those that pose a threat to human dignity and well-being".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49502279|title=Our posthuman future : consequences of the biotechnology revolution|last=Francis.|first=Fukuyama,|date=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=0374236437|edition= 1st|location=New York|pages=182|oclc=49502279}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He rejects the idea that "theology, philosophy, or politics" should not influence the scientific process, because "science by itself cannot establish the ends to which it is put."  "Nazi doctors who injected concentration camp victims with infection agents... were in fact legitimate scientists who gathered real data that could potentially be put to good use."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49502279|title=Our posthuman future : consequences of the biotechnology revolution|last=Francis.|first=Fukuyama,|date=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=0374236437|edition= 1st|location=New York|pages=185|oclc=49502279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, morality is needed to establish the end of science and the technology that science produces, and pronounce on whether those ends are good or bad." Political process that could decide on the legitimate uses of science is enabled by a democratically constituted political community acting through elected and scientifically informed representatives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Fukuyama rejects the notion that biotechnology cannot be controlled. Nuclear weapons, nuclear power, ballistic missiles, biological and chemical warfare, illegal human organ trade, neuropharmacological drugs, genetically modified foods, human experimentation have been the subject of effective international political control. Occasional breaking of the law, cannot be used as an excuse not to pursue legislature at all. "Every country makes murder a crime and attaches severe penalties to homicide, and yet murders nonetheless occur. The fact that they do has never been a reason for giving up on the law or on attempts to enforce it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49502279|title=Our posthuman future : consequences of the biotechnology revolution|last=Francis.|first=Fukuyama,|date=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=0374236437|edition= 1st|location=New York|pages=189|oclc=49502279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author outlines several issues that need to be address to establish an effective international regulation of biotechnology:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49502279|title=Our posthuman future : consequences of the biotechnology revolution|last=Francis.|first=Fukuyama,|date=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=0374236437|edition= 1st|location=New York|pages=188–190|oclc=49502279}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Over-regulation can create inefficiencies, drive up the business costs, and stifle innovation.
# While most regulatory initiatives begin domestically, to be truly effective the regulation needs to be negotiated, harmonized, and enacted on the international level. 
# Risks, benefits, and enforcement costs of biotechnology need to clearly defined.
# Different ethical views of biotechnology throughout the world.
# Different political systems throughout the world.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and introduction to law enforcement:

'''[[Law enforcement]]''' &amp;ndash; subsystem of society that promotes adherence to the [[law]] by discovering and punishing persons who violate rules and [[norm (social)|norm]]s governing that society. Although the term may encompass entities such as [[court]]s and [[prison]]s, it most frequently applies to those who directly engage in patrols or surveillance to dissuade and discover [[crime|criminal]] activity, and those who investigate crimes and apprehend offenders.&lt;ref name="ILE"&gt;Kären M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8125">{{for|the defunct political party founded in 1985|Parti indépendantiste (1985)}}
The '''Parti indépendantiste''' ('''PI''', in [[English language|English]]: Independence Party) was a [[political party]] promoting the [[Quebec independence|independence of Quebec]] from [[Canada]].

==History==
The party was founded in 2007 by Éric Tremblay and Richard Gervais, in the aftermath of the [[Parti Québécois]]'s defeat in the [[Quebec general election, 2007|2007 Quebec election]]. It was registered as an official political party by the [[Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec]] on October 18, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/fr/ppc_liste_partis_candidats.asp?sect=prov#texte Elections Quebec]&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates ran in three [[by-elections]] in [[Bourget (electoral district)|Bourget]], [[Hull (provincial electoral district)|Hull]], and [[Pointe-aux-Trembles]] held on May 12, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monvote.qc.ca/partielles/fr/ monvote.qc.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vigile.net/Le-Parti-independantiste-fera-ses  Le Parti indépendantiste fera ses premières armes aux élections partielles, May 10, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Party founder Richard Gervais, running in Bourget, received 376 votes (2.33%), finishing sixth out of six candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/english/provincial/election-results/by-elections.php?e=5&amp;s=1#s Official Results (Bourget, 2008), Le Directeur général des élections du Québec].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the December [[Quebec general election, 2008|2008 provincial election]], the party nominated 19 candidates, who won a total of 4,227 votes, or 0.13% of the provincial total.

On November 24, 2011 at Université du Québec à Montréal, a debate between independentist parties included the [[Parti Québécois]], [[Quebec solidaire]] and [[Option nationale]], but excluded PI.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vigile.net/Debat-sur-Les-strategies-et-modes&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Quebec general election, 2012|2012 provincial election]], the party nominated ten candidates, who won a total of 1,244 votes, or 0.03% of the provincial total.

In the [[Quebec general election, 2014|2014 provincial election]], the party nominated one candidate, party leader Michel Lepage, who won 126 votes in Borduas riding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resultats.dgeq.org/resultatsSommaires.en.html Directeur général des élections du Québec, April 9, 2014 Final  2:24 pm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409010704/http://resultats.dgeq.org/resultatsSommaires.en.html |date=April 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
According to former leader Éric Tremblay, the [[Parti Québécois]] has given up the will to actively seek the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereignty of Quebec]].  Tremblay considers that, if given a majority of seats at the [[National Assembly of Quebec]], the Parti indépendantiste would have clear mandate to achieve sovereignty, even if it receives less than 50% of the popular vote. Tremblay did not hide his intention to put an end to all public financing of English-language schools and hospitals come his election, even though he would offer unilingual English-speakers health care in their language. The party suggests a reduction of more than half of the number of immigrants admitted, which would be reduced to 20,000, and the selection of immigrants based on the knowledge of French.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.canoe.com/infos/quebeccanada/lequebecvote/archives/2008/11/20081118-162257.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership and support==
Éric Tremblay was the leader from 2008 to 2011, and the leader since 2011 has been Michel Lepage. According to the [[Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec]], donations were  $33792 in 2008 and then fell sharply in 2009 and 2010. Prominent supporters have included:

* Author [[Victor-Lévy Beaulieu]], a disillusioned Parti Québécois supporter, voted for the [[Action démocratique du Québec]] (ADQ) in protest in the [[Quebec general election, 2007|2007 Quebec election]], but has become disappointed with the party. He announced on April 15, 2008 his intention to run for the Parti Indépendantiste in the district of [[Rivière-du-Loup (electoral district)|Rivière-du-Loup]] against ADQ leader [[Mario Dumont]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio-canada.ca/regions/est-quebec/2008/04/15/006-parti-independantiste_n.asp Radio-Canada 15 April 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vigile.net/Pourquoi-j-adhere-au-Parti Vigile.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419235926/http://www.vigile.net/Pourquoi-j-adhere-au-Parti |date=2008-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Former Bloc Québécois [[House of Commons of Canada|Member of Parliament]] [[Ghislain Lebel]] announced on April 30, 2008 that he would be a Parti indépendantiste candidate. 
* Comedian Ghislain Taschereau left the party and became a member of the defunct [[Option nationale]] (ON) party.

'''Peter Stumpp''' (died 1589) (whose name is also spelled as '''Peter Stube''', '''Peter Stubbe''', '''Peter Stübbe''' or '''Peter Stumpf''') was a German farmer, accused of [[werewolf]]ery, [[witchcraft]] and [[cannibalism]]. He was known as 'the Werewolf of Bedburg'.

== Sources ==
The most comprehensive source on the case is a pamphlet of 16 pages published in [[London]] in 1590, the translation of a German print of which no copies have survived. The English pamphlet, of which two copies exist (one in the British Museum and one in the Lambeth Library), was rediscovered by occultist [[Montague Summers]] in 1920. It describes Stumpp's life and alleged crimes and the trial, and includes many statements from neighbours and witnesses of the crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Orenstein, ''Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality, and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale'', p. 91, {{ISBN|0-465-04125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Summers reprints the entire pamphlet, including a woodcut, on pages 253 to 259 of his work ''The Werewolf''.

Additional information is provided by the diaries of Hermann von Weinsberg, a Cologne alderman, and by a number of illustrated broadsheets, which were printed in southern Germany and were probably based on the German version of the London pamphlet. The original documents seem to have been lost during the wars of the centuries that followed.

Contemporary reference was made to the pamphlet by [[Edward Fairfax]] in his firsthand account of alleged witch persecution of his own daughters in 1621.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Fairfax, Daemonologica: A Discourse on Witchcraft, p.97, R. Ackrill: Harrogate, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Peter Stumpp's name is also spelled as ''Peter Stube'', ''Peter Stub'',&lt;ref&gt;Edward Fairfax, Daemonologica: A Discourse on Witchcraft, p.97, R. Ackrill: Harrogate, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Peter Stubbe'', ''Peter Stübbe'' or ''Peter Stumpf'', and other aliases include such names as Abal Griswold, Abil Griswold, and Ubel Griswold. The name "Stump" or "Stumpf" may have been given him as a reference to the fact that his left hand had been cut off leaving only a stump, in German "Stumpf". {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} 
It was alleged that as the "werewolf" had its left forepaw cut off, then the same injury proved the guilt of the man. Stumpp was born at the village of Epprath near the country-town of [[Bedburg]] in the [[Electorate of Cologne]]. His actual date of birth is not known, as the local church registers were destroyed during the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648). He was a wealthy farmer of his rural community.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Serial Killers {{ISBN|1-85648-328-2}} p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1580s he seems to have been a widower with two children; a girl called Beele (Sybil), who seems to have been older than fifteen years old, and a son of an unknown age.

== Accusations ==
During 1589, Stumpp had one of the most lurid and famous [[werewolf]] trials of history. After being stretched on a [[Rack (torture device)|rack]], and before further torture commenced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedrich|first=Otto|title=Going crazy: An inquiry into madness in our time|edition=2nd prt.|year=1976|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0-671-22174-4|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; he confessed to having practiced [[black magic]] since he was twelve years old. He claimed that the [[Devil]] had given him a magical [[Belt (clothing)|belt or girdle]], which enabled him to [[Metamorphosis|metamorphose]] into "the likeness of a greedy, devouring wolf, strong and mighty, with eyes great and large, which in the night sparkled like fire, a mouth great and wide, with most sharp and cruel teeth, a huge body, and mighty paws." Removing the belt, he said, made him transform back to his human form. No such belt was ever found after his arrest.

For twenty-five years, Stumpp had allegedly been an "insatiable bloodsucker" who gorged on the flesh of [[goat]]s, [[sheep|lamb]]s, and [[sheep]], as well as men, women, and children. Being threatened with torture he confessed to killing and eating fourteen children, two [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] women, whose [[fetus]]es he ripped from their wombs and "ate their hearts panting hot and raw,"&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Serial Killers {{ISBN|1-85648-328-2}} p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; which he later described as "dainty morsels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wagner|first=Stephen|title=The Werewolf of Bedburg|url=http://paranormal.about.com/od/werewolves/a/The-Werewolf-Of-Bedburg.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the fourteen children was his own son, whose [[brain]] he was reported to have devoured.

Not only was Stumpp accused of being a serial murderer and [[Cannibalism|cannibal]], but also of having an [[incest]]uous relationship with his daughter,&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Serial Killers {{ISBN|1-85648-328-2}} p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; who was sentenced to die with him, and that he had coupled with a distant relative, which was also considered to be incestuous according to the law. In addition to this he confessed to having had intercourse with a [[succubus]] sent to him by the Devil.

== Execution ==
[[File:Lukas Mayer 1589 Hinrichtung Peter Stump.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Composite [[woodcut]] print by Lukas Mayer of the execution of Peter Stumpp in 1589 at [[Bedburg]] near Cologne.]]
The execution of Stumpp, on October 31, 1589, and of his daughter and mistress, is one of the most brutal on record: he was put to a [[breaking wheel|wheel]], where "flesh was torn from his body", in ten places, with red-hot pincers, followed by his arms and legs. Then his limbs were broken with the blunt side of an axehead to prevent him from returning from the grave, before he was [[decapitation|beheaded]] and his body burned on a pyre. His daughter and mistress had already been flayed and strangled and were burned along with Stumpp's body. As a warning against similar behavior, local authorities erected a pole with the torture wheel and the figure of a wolf on it, and at the very top they placed Peter Stumpp's severed head.

== Background ==
There are a number of details of the text of the London pamphlet that are inconsistent with the historical facts.

The years during which Stumpp was supposed to have committed most of his crimes (1582–1589) were marked by internal warfare in the [[Electorate of Cologne]] after the abortive introduction of Protestantism by the former Archbishop [[Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg]]. He had been assisted by Adolf, Count of [[Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler|Neuenahr]], who was also the lord of [[Bedburg]].

Stumpp was most certainly a convert to Protestantism. The war brought the invasion of armies of either side, the assaults by marauding soldiers and eventually an epidemic of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]].

When the Protestants were defeated during 1587, Bedburg Castle became the headquarters of Catholic mercenaries commanded by the new lord of Bedburg—Werner, Count of [[Salm-Reifferscheid-Dyck|Salm-Reifferscheidt-Dyck]], who was a staunch Catholic determined to re-establish the Roman faith.

So it is not inconceivable that the werewolf trial was but a barely concealed political trial, with the help of which the new lord of Bedburg planned to bully the Protestants of the territory back into Catholicism. If it had only been just another execution of a werewolf and a couple of witches, as occurred about this time in various parts of Germany, the attendance of members of the aristocracy—perhaps including the new Archbishop and Elector of Cologne—would be surprising. Furthermore, the trial remained a singular event.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sunday Herald]], 1 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this does not mean that the charges were without basis in fact. The execution of a mere Protestant convert would have been deeply unlikely to have drawn the aristocratic attention Stumpp's trial did, and while it was unlikely for the elite to attend to any given werewolf or witch trial, the sheer scale of Stumpp's alleged crimes would have made it more visible to the public at large and the nobility.

==In popular culture==

The U.S. metal band [[Macabre (band)|Macabre]] recorded a song about Peter Stumpp, titled "The Werewolf of Bedburg"; it can be found on the ''[[Murder Metal]]'' album.

The German horror punk band [[The Other (band)|The Other]] recorded a song about Peter Stumpp, titled "Werewolf of Bedburg"; it can be found on the ''[[Casket Case]]'' album.

In the [[Pine Deep Trilogy]] of novelist and folklorist [[Jonathan Maberry]], Peter Stumpp is the supernatural villain Ubel Griswold. Since Griswold is actually one of Stumpp's historical aliases, Maberry decided to use the name of Ubel Griswold instead of openly telling people that the villain was the famous werewolf Peter Stumpp until later on in the third book of the series, ''Bad Moon Rising''.

In the [[Jim Butcher]] book ''Fool Moon'' there are several characters that use enchanted wolf pelt belts to transform into a wolf form, similar to the belt Peter Stump claimed to have.

A reference to Peter Stumpp is also in [[William Peter Blatty]]'s book, ''[[The Exorcist (novel)|The Exorcist]]''. When Father Karras and Kinderman talk about Satanism they say "Terrible, was this theory, Father, or fact?" "Well, there's William Stumpf, for example. Or Peter. I can't remember. Anyway, a German in the sixteenth century who thought he was a werewolf".

The direct-to-video ''[[Big Top Scooby-Doo!]]'', uses a portion of Lukas Mayer's woodcut of the execution of Stumpp in 1589, though in the movie no mention of Stumpp is made. The portion used depicts a man cutting off a werewolf's left paw (supposedly Stumpp in werewolf form) and a child being attacked by a werewolf. The woodcut scene shown in the film restores the werewolf's left paw and removes the child in the second werewolf's jaws, making it appear as if the swordsman is fighting one of the werewolves while another flees.

In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' audio drama ''[[Loups-Garoux]]'', Pieter Stubbe was in fact a werewolf. He managed to escape before he was executed and lived for another five centuries. He was defeated by the [[Fifth Doctor]] in Brazil in 2080. It is implied that he ate both the [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]] and [[John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan|Lord Lucan]].

Journalist and fiction writer J.E. Reich partially based her short story "The Werewolves of Anspach," which was nominated for multiple awards, on the life of Peter Stumpp.&lt;ref&gt;http://littlefiction.com/beta/JEReich_TheWerewolvesofAnspach.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Peter Stumpp was also told in episode 3 of the podcast ''[[Lore (podcast)|Lore]]'', released on April 6, 2015. In 2017, the podcast episode was adapted into the fifth episode of the [[Lore (TV series)|TV series adaptation]] of ''Lore'', where he was played by [[Adam Goldberg]].

The case inspired Neil MacKay's novel, 'The Wolf Trial' (Glasgow: Freight Books, 2016. {{ISBN|978-1-910449-72-1}})

Peter Stump is referenced in 'The Werewolf of Bamburg' by Oliver Potzsch. It briefly mentions his execution and crimes.

Gentry received a master's degree in [[physics]] from the [[University of Florida]], and then worked in the defense industry in nuclear weapons research.&lt;ref name=Numbers/&gt; In 1959, he was influenced by a verse he read in the Bible while looking at polonium halos, and subsequently converted to [[Seventh-day Adventism]]. Thereafter, he entered the doctoral program at [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], but left when he was refused permission to work on the [[age of the Earth]] for his dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

By this time he was convinced that [[radiohalos]] might be the key to determining the age of the Earth, and might be capable of vindicating [[flood geology]]. He continued to work on the subject at home using a small microscope and attempted to publish his results (minus his creationist conclusions) in one or more peer reviewed scientific journals. In 1969, while Gentry was affiliated with an Adventist college in Maryland, [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] invited him to use their facilities, as a guest scientist in the hope that his work on radiohalos might lead to discovering super-heavy elements. This relationship was terminated as a result of his participation in ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]''.&lt;ref name=Numbers/&gt;

==Claims and criticism==

Gentry has had strong disagreements with other creationists over some details of flood geology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halos.com/faq-replies/index.htm Exchanges], Earth Science Associates&lt;/ref&gt; A number of creationists, including fellow Seventh-day Adventists, have criticised his work.&lt;ref name=Numbers/&gt;

In the late 1970s, Gentry challenged the scientific community to synthesize "a hand-sized specimen of a typical [[biotite]]-bearing granite" as a test of his claims. The scientific response was dismissive.  Geologist [[G. Brent Dalrymple]] stated:&lt;ref name=Numbers/&gt; "As far as I am concerned, Gentry's challenge is silly. … He has proposed an absurd and inconclusive experiment to test a perfectly ridiculous and unscientific hypothesis that ignores virtually the entire body of geological knowledge."

In 1981, Gentry was a defense witness in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case over the constitutional validity of Act 590 that mandated that "[[creation science]]" be given equal time in public schools with [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Act 590 was ruled to be unconstitutional (a verdict that was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'').

Gentry has devised his own [[creationist cosmologies|creationist cosmology]] and filed a lawsuit in 2001 against [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] and [[Cornell University]] after personnel deleted ten of his papers about his cosmology from the public preprint server [[arXiv]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halos.com/faq-replies/arxiv-lawsuit.htm Lawsuit Filed], Earth Science Associates&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 March 2004, Gentry's lawsuit against arXiv was dismissed by a Tennessee court on the grounds that it lacked [[territorial jurisdiction]], as neither defendant in the case was considered to have a significant presence in the state of Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orionfdn.org/papers/nature-04-01-2004.htm Retribution denied to creationist suing arXiv over religious bias], News in Brief, [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], 1 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

His self-published book ''Creation's Tiny Mystery'' was reviewed by geologist Gregg Wilkerson, who said that it has several logical flaws and concluded that "the book is a source of much misinformation about current geologic thinking and confuses fact with interpretation." Wilkerson also noted that the book contains considerable autobiographical material and he observed that "[i]n general I don't think educators will find it's worth their time to tread through this creationist's whining."&lt;ref&gt;Gregg Wilkerson, "''Creation's tiny mystery'' Review" in ''Reviews of Creationist Books'' ed Liz Rank Hughes, [[National Center for Science Education]], 1992. page 55 {{ISBN|0-939873-52-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism of Gentry's "frequent whining about discrimination" has also been made by fellow creationists, who concluded that "his scientific snubs resulted more from his own abrasive style than from his peculiar ideas", according to critic [[Ronald L. Numbers]], a historian of science.&lt;ref name=Numbers/&gt;

'''Sigurdur Thordarson''' (Sigurður Ingi Þórðarson) was born in 1992 in [[Reykjavík]]. He is known for his involvement with the [[Whistleblowing (ethics)|whistleblowing]] organization [[WikiLeaks]], as well as his interactions with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). In 2010 he was arrested for stealing and leaking classified information about the bank structure in [[Iceland]].&lt;ref name="visir.is"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vísir - Unglingur handtekinn fyrir að stela upplýsingum um Eið Smára|url = http://www.visir.is/unglingur-handtekinn-fyrir-ad-stela-upplysingum-um-eid-smara/article/2010269393239|website = visir.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained the information from a lawyer that aided wealthy people in tax evasion, whose name was Gunnar Gunnarsson.&lt;ref name="dv.is"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hjálpar auðmönnum að sleppa við skattinn - DV|url = http://www.dv.is/frettir/2010/2/15/hjalpar-audmonnum-ad-sleppa-vid-skattinn/|website = DV|access-date = 2016-01-14|language = is-IS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunnar worked for an investment firm called Milestone ehf. Gunnar obtained Sigurdur's services to set up computer systems and delete data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Upplýsingastuldur í rannsókn|url = http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2010/02/01/upplysingastuldur_i_rannsokn/|website = www.mbl.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Sigurdur was arrested he was introduced to [[Julian Assange]], the editor and founder of [[WikiLeaks]]. Sigurdur started his time there in early 2010, and participated in preparing many of [[Information published by WikiLeaks|WikiLeaks's biggest leaks]]. After a year in WikiLeaks service Sigurdur was suspected of embezzling funds from the WikiLeaks online store.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Official WikiLeaks Merchandise Store|url = http://wikileaks.spreadshirt.com/|website = wikileaks.spreadshirt.com|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vísir - Wikileaks kærir piltinn sem var yfirheyrður af FBI fyrir fjárdrátt|url = http://www.visir.is/wikileaks-kaerir-piltinn-sem-var-yfirheyrdur-af-fbi-fyrir-fjardratt/article/2013130209409|website = visir.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks filed criminal charges against Sigurdur with the [[Icelandic Police|Metropolitan Police of Iceland]], who investigated the case and later dropped it due to lack of evidence. Sigurdur later plead guilty to the embezzlement along with other economic crimes, in 2013.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Siggi hakkari ákærður fyrir stórfelld svik|url = http://www.ruv.is/frett/siggi-hakkari-akaerdur-fyrir-storfelld-svik|website = RÚV|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sigurdur was ordered to pay the victims 15 million [[Icelandic króna|ISK]] (roughly [[United States dollar|$]]115,000) &lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Information leaks==
Sigurdur began leaking information about the Icelandic banking system to the media in late 2009. He leaked information about a number of individuals in the Icelandic banking system, information that showed that individuals were committing illegal acts in relation to banking. One of the leaks Sigurdur leaked was regarding a case called "Vafningsmalid." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vafningsmálið í stærra samhengi|url = http://www.ruv.is/frett/vafningsmalid-i-staerra-samhengi|website = RÚV|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; That case involved powerful political persons such as [[Bjarni Benediktsson (born 1970)|Bjarni Benediktsson]] during his time as an MP. Bjarni reported that the case was only a political smear campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Gæti verið farinn í hvert dómsmálið á fætur öðru á móti þessum gæjum" - DV|url = http://www.dv.is/frettir/2013/2/17/eg-gaeti-verid-farinn-i-hvert-domsmalid-faetur-odru/|website = DV|access-date = 2016-01-14|language = is-IS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information published by local news media obtained from Sigurdur also showed that one of Iceland's biggest football stars, [[Eiður Guðjohnsen]], was in deep debt and almost bankrupt. After the information was published, Eiður sued the local newspaper ''[[DV (newspaper)|DV]]'' for publishing this information. ''DV'' lost the case in a lower court, but won an appeal to the Supreme Court of Iceland, stating that the information was a matter for the public. &lt;sup&gt;[&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vísir - Eiður Smári tapaði - DV mátti fjalla um fjármálin|url = http://www.visir.is/eidur-smari-tapadi---dv-matti-fjalla-um-fjarmalin/article/2011111129364|website = visir.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fjármál Eiðs Smára áttu erindi við almenning|url = http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2011/01/07/fjarmal_eids_smara_attu_erindi_vid_almenning/|website = www.mbl.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst other information that Sigurdur admitted to have leaked in an interview with the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The WikiLeaks Mole|url = https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-wikileaks-mole-20140106|website = Rolling Stone|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vísir - Ítarlegt viðtal við Sigga hakkara í Rolling Stone|url = http://www.visir.is/itarlegt-vidtal-vid-sigga-hakkara-i-rolling-stone/article/2014140109546|website = visir.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; was information about local business men Karl Wernersson. He was the owner of the Milestone ehf that was the investment company Sigurdur stole most of the information from. Other names in the documents leaked by Sigurdur included information about [[Birkir Kristinsson]], who was recently convicted of economic crimes while working for [[Glitnir (bank)|Glitnir bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vísir - Birkir Kristinsson dæmdur í fjögurra ára fangelsi|url = http://www.visir.is/birkir-kristinsson-daemdur-i-fjogurra-ara-fangelsi/article/2015151209472|website = visir.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some speculate that information from Sigurdur was used as evidence in that case, Sigurdur also leaked a classified report about one of the bigger aluminum plants in Iceland. The report stated that the plant was paying 1/4 of what other aluminum plants in the world are paying for electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Segir meðalverð greitt fyrir orku|url = http://www.ruv.is/frett/segir-medalverd-greitt-fyrir-orku|website = RÚV|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Landsvirkjun opinberar orkuverð|url = http://www.ruv.is/frett/landsvirkjun-opinberar-orkuverd|website = RÚV|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other information leaked by Sigurdur contained information about other local business men such as Gunnar Gunnarsson,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Slapp við 700 milljónir - DV|url = http://www.dv.is/frettir/2010/5/20/slapp-vid-700-milljonir/|website = DV|access-date = 2016-01-14|language = is-IS}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also has been reported to assist football star [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] in tax affairs.&lt;ref name="dv.is"/&gt; In 2013 Sigurdur got in an argument with [[Birgitta Jónsdóttir]] on [[Twitter]] over the release of the loanbooks of the Glitnir Bank. Sigurdur argued that she had no involvement, but he later stated that he had given her the files years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Siggi hakkari segist hafa látið Birgittu fá Glitnisskjölin fyrir löngu - DV|url = http://www.dv.is/frettir/2014/1/2/siggi-hakkari-segist-hafa-latid-birgittu-fa-glitnisskjolin-fyrir-longu/|website = DV|access-date = 2016-01-14|language = is-IS}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Sigurdur arrived at the offices of the Special Prosecutor, who investigated the [[2008–11 Icelandic financial crisis|bank collapse in Iceland in 2008]]. Sigurdur reportedly gave them all the information he had on Milestone and other local business men, however instead of using some of the information obtained from Sigurdur in investigation the investigators decided to sell the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Viðskiptablaðið - Hætta við rannsókn á lögreglumönnum|url = http://www.vb.is/frettir/haetta-vid-rannsokn-logreglumonnum/80478/|website = www.vb.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Miklu miklu alvarlegra brot en sérstakur lætur í veðri vaka" - DV|url = http://www.dv.is/frettir/2012/5/25/miklu-miklu-alvarlegra-brot-en-serstakur-laetur-i-vedri-vaka/|website = DV|access-date = 2016-01-14|language = is-IS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vísir - Kæran setti lífið úr skorðum|url = http://www.visir.is/kaeran-setti-lifid-ur-skordum/article/2014709139915|website = visir.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leyndarhjúpur um ofurkrimma - DV|url = http://www.dv.is/menning/2013/6/5/leyndarhjupur-um-ofurkrimma-SG0LE9/|website = DV|access-date = 2016-01-14|language = is-IS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case against the two police officers was later dismissed, and it has been reported that the investigators made roughly 30 Million [[Icelandic króna|ISK]] ([[United States dollar|$]]250.000) from the documents. In January 2010 Sigurdur was arrested on suspicion of stealing classified information, that case never made it to the court system and Sigurdur always denied his involvement until the ''Rolling Stone'' interview.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sigurdur was only seventeen years old when he was arrested for leaking the information.&lt;ref name="visir.is"/&gt;

==WikiLeaks connection==
[[Kristinn Hrafnsson]], spokesperson for WikiLeaks, claimed that Sigurdur Thordarson had no involvement&lt;ref name="Vísar öllum tengslum á bug"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vísar öllum tengslum á bug|url = http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2013/02/04/visar_ollum_tengslum_a_bug/|website = www.mbl.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the whistleblowing organization and called Sigurdur a "troubled young teen that was a pathological liar and should be institutionalized", although there are many sources that claim that Hrafnsson wasn’t being truthful. In 2013 the movie [[The Fifth Estate (film)|The Fifth Estate]] was released featuring a character based on Sigurdur, he was played by [[Jamie Blackley]], Sigurdur is also mentioned in Domsheitberg's book, during his time with WikiLeaks he reportedly used the handles PenguinX, Singi201 and "Q".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = First Edition Thus|title = Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange at the World's Most Dangerous Website|publisher = Crown|date = 2011-02-15|location = New York, NY|isbn = 9780307951915|first = Daniel|last = Domscheit-Berg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sigurdur also reportedly saw to it that WikiLeaks came through partially on its promise to give $50.000 to the [[Chelsea Manning]] defense team. Sigurdur managed to get 20% ($10.000) of the funds to Manning's defense team, and was in contact with David Coombs, attorney for Manning, WikiLeaks never donated the rest they had promised. It is unclear what Sigurdur did at WikiLeaks. Many people who are still in the inner circle of WikiLeaks claim that Sigurdur role was minor and that he participated at a very low level in some projects WikiLeaks had, while other sources close to WikiLeaks circle state that his involvement was much greater. One of these people is Tangerine Bolen, the founder of [[Revolution Truth]] and a close friend to film maker [[Michael Moore]]. Tangerine said in an interview with [[RT (TV network)|RT Russia Today]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = FBI Infiltrates Wikileaks {{!}} Think Tank|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4mJhrPpebY|date = 2013-07-04|accessdate = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; that although Sigurdur lied often to her, WikiLeaks is understating his involvement, stating that Sigurdur was her "handle" at WikiLeaks &lt;sup&gt;[32]&lt;/sup&gt;. Many other reports state that Sigurdur was a part of WikiLeaks inner circle. One example of that is that if looked at very closely in this video &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WikiLeaks spoofs MasterCard advert|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/wikileaks/8614990/WikiLeaks-spoofs-MasterCard-advert.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sigurdur Thordarson's name could be seen on the [[MasterCard]] Gold card that Assange cuts in the video. On many occasions during interviews with Sigurdur, Kristinn Hrafnsson has almost always says that Sigurdur is a pathological liar and should not be trusted.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vísar öllum tengslum á bug"/&gt; Kristinn has repeatedly called media outlets such as ''[[Reykjavik Grapevine]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[BBC News]] and [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']] fools for believing the "hype".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kristinn on Siggi: Don't Believe The Hype - The Reykjavik Grapevine|url = http://grapevine.is/mag/articles/2013/07/20/siggi-disclaimer/|website = The Reykjavik Grapevine|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David Kushner]], the reporter who took the ''Rolling Stone'' interview with Sigurdur, Sigurdur provided ''Rolling Stone'' with over 1 terabyte of data (1000 gigabytes ) to the paper about WikiLeaks, and said that either Sigurdur was the real deal or this was the biggest and most elaborate lie in the digital age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also number of photos related to articlesabout the extradition hearings in London July 2011, show Sigurdur escorting Julian to the court house &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Julian Assange: from hero to zero|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/02/assange-hero-zero-swedes-pitiable|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 2011-11-02|access-date = 2016-01-27|issn = 0261-3077|first = Karin|last = Olsson|last2 = Stockholm}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a video where Sigurdur holds the press from Julian while he enters a cab &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = Julian Assange leaves final hearing - as court defers extradition decision - 13/07/2011|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqBjeeF7QKs|date = 2011-07-13|accessdate = 2016-01-27|last = andriuskk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FBI connection==
In August 2011, Sigurdur contacted the [[United States Embassy in Reykjavik]] and claimed he had information about an ongoing criminal investigation in the United States, and requested a meeting. The day after Sigurdur was summoned to the embassy, where he gave diplomatic staff official documents showing that Sigurdur was who he claimed he was. The day after the meeting with the embassy official the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] sent a private jet with eight federal agents and a prosecutor to question Sigurdur. The FBI gave Icelandic authorities notice that they were questioning Sigurdur in relation to an co-investigation that [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] and [[LulzSec]] were about to infiltrate Icelandic government systems. After the authorities found out Sigurdur was being questioned about WikiLeaks, the FBI was asked to leave Iceland. The FBI left the country a few days later but took Sigurdur with them to Denmark where questioning continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WikiLeaks reports the FBI to Danish police|url = http://www.thelocal.dk/20140713/wikileaks|website = www.thelocal.dk|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sigurdur was subsequently allowed to return to Iceland. In 2012 Sigurdur met with the federal agents on a number of occasions, and was flown to [[Copenhagen]] where Sigurdur was provided a room in a luxury hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Siggi hakkari á lúxushótelum|url = http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2013/08/15/siggi_hakkari_a_luxushotelum/|website = www.mbl.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sigurdur was allowed to return to Iceland after every meeting. Sigurdur met with the FBI again in [[Washington D.C.]] and spent a couple of days with them there. The final meeting that Sigurdur said took place with the FBI was during a course Sigurdur was enrolled in at [[Aarhus]] in Denmark, teaching IT Security. Sigurdur met with the agents there and handed over several hard drives. it is reported that Sigurdur got $5,000 for his assistance and that he was on the FBI's payroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WikiLeaks Volunteer Was a Paid Informant for the FBI|url = https://www.wired.com/2013/06/wikileaks-mole/|website = WIRED|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Siggi hakkari' á launaskrá FBI|url = http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2013/06/27/siggi_hakkari_a_launaskra_fbi/|website = www.mbl.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Sigurdur was also summoned to the General Committee of the [[Althing|Icelandic Parliament]] after days of being discussed in the Parliament. There Sigurdur was questioned about his involvement in the FBI case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = mbl.is - mbl.is|url = http://www.mbl.is/frettir/knippi/3044/|website = www.mbl.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then-[[Minister of the Interior (Iceland)|Minister of the Interior]] [[Ögmundur Jónasson]] said in Parliament that Sigurdur was young and the FBI meant him to be a "spy" within the WikiLeaks organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Íslendingurinn hugsaður sem tálbeita|url = http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2013/02/14/hugsadur_sem_talbeita/|website = www.mbl.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the parliament hearing Sigurdur arrived with two bodyguards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vísir - Kom með lífverði á nefndasvið Alþingis|url = http://www.visir.is/kom-med-lifverdi-a-nefndasvid-althingis/article/2013130229823|website = visir.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Spy Computer"==
In January 2011 it was revealed in Icelandic media that a computer had been found within closed sections of the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vísir - Njósnatölva fannst á þingi - hafa Wikileaks grunaða|url = http://www.visir.is/njosnatolva-fannst-a-thingi---hafa-wikileaks-grunada/article/2011956569254|website = visir.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to reports it was alleged that WikiLeaks was suspected of placing the computer inside the Parliament. Bjarni Benediktsson the MP Sigurdur leaked information about comments found on the computer &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bein árás á Alþingi|url = http://www.mbl.is/frettir/sjonvarp/54648/|website = mbl.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sigurdur was questioned about his involvement in this case, but has always denied any involvement in it. ''[[Morgunblaðið]]'', Iceland's largest newspaper published on the front page on January 31, 2011 that a local reporter for the paper ''DV'' was suspected of obtaining the information from Sigurdur. The reporter was said to be under investigation for receiving the information from Sigurdur and manipulating Sigurdur into leaking the information and placing the computer inside Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Blaðamaður DV með réttarstöðu grunaðs manns|url = http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/1366005/|website = www.mbl.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.visir.is/krefur-agnesi-um-haerri-miskabaetur/article/2011842122304|title = Krefur Agnesi um hærri miskabætur|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reporter sued the newspaper for libel and won the case. ''Morgunblaðið'' withdrew the report and issued an apology to the reporter on December 7. There was a report in the Icelandic media that stated that specialists were now checking whether parliament phones were spied on by [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vísir - Hlerun í Alþingi: "Grafalvarlegt ef satt reynist"|url = http://www.visir.is/hlerun-i-althingi---grafalvarlegt-ef-satt-reynist-/article/2013712079921|website = visir.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vísir - Kanna hvort símar Alþingis voru hleraðir|url = http://www.visir.is/kanna-hvort-simar-althingis-voru-hleradir/article/2013131209224|website = visir.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' published chat logs that indicated such.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = It’s Not a WikiLeak: Assange-Manning Chat Logs Surface on Army Website|url = https://www.wired.com/2013/12/wikileaks-assange-manning/|website = WIRED|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is believed to support the claim that Sigurdur is involved with the spy computer somehow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vísir - Wikileaks með hljóðupptökur úr Alþingishúsinu|url = http://www.visir.is/wikileaks-med-hljodupptokur-ur-althingishusinu/article/2013131209295|website = visir.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birgitta Jónsdóttir]] issued a statement stating that she had never heard of any recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vísir - Birgitta aldrei séð né heyrt um hljóðupptökurnar|url = http://www.visir.is/birgitta-aldrei-sed-ne-heyrt-um-hljodupptokurnar/article/2013131209209|website = visir.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anonymous and LulzSec==
During his time at WikiLeaks it has also been reported that Sigurdur ordered attacks on Icelandic governmental infrastructures such as the servers hosting the Ministry's websites www.stjornarradid.is and www.landsnet.is. Those [[DDoS]] attacks were successful for a few hours. This was all done after an Icelandic business man that owns an Icelandic data center asked Sigurdur to do so. It has also been reported that Sigurdur ordered [[Hector Monsegur]] (Sabu) and his team to attack [[Icelandic Police|Icelandic State Police]] servers. This all happened during Sabu's time as an FBI informant. It is reported that Sigurdur obtained the unpublished version of a report about the surveillance unit at the U.S Embassy in Reykjavik.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.innanrikisraduneyti.is/media/2010/Skyrsla-um-konnun-embaettis-rikislogreglustjora.pdf|title = Skýrsla um könnun embættis ríkislögreglustjóra|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ríkissaksóknara send málefni er varða starfsemi eftirlitssveitar við bandaríska sendiráðið á Íslandi {{!}} Fréttir {{!}} Innanríkisráðuneytið|url = https://www.innanrikisraduneyti.is/dmr/frettir/nr/24357|website = Innanríkisráðuneytið|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been reported that Sigurdur Thordarson was WikiLeaks's connection to the hacker world. Many reports have indicated that persons part of Anonymous and LulzSec reported to Sigurdur. That was covered partially in the book ''We are Anonymous''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = We Are Anonymous by Parmy Olson - Books - Random House Books Australia|url = http://www.randomhouse.com.au/books/parmy-olson/we-are-anonymous-9780434022083.aspx|website = Random House Australia|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports state that Sigurdur obtained many leaks through this method that WikiLeaks later published, such as [[Kissinger cables|The Kissinger cables]] and [[Syria Files|The Syria Files]].It is unknown how WikiLeaks or Sigurdur obtained the information, though chat logs between Sigurdur and Hector Monsegur a.k.a. Sabu have surfaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Here's What It Looks Like When Two Hacker FBI Informants Try To Inform On Each Other|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/06/28/heres-what-it-looks-like-when-two-hacker-fbi-informants-try-to-inform-on-each-other/#2715e4857a0b7e486573cc00|website = Forbes|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SABU Hands over the "Syria Files" to Wikileaks staffer Sigurdur Thordarson in WikiLeaks related News|url = http://www.wikileaks-forum.com/-wikileaks-related-news/23/sabu-hands-over-the-syria-files-to-wikileaks-staffer-sigurdur-thordarson/31055/|website = www.wikileaks-forum.com|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people also speculate whether the attack on the website of the Central Intelligence Agency was ordered by Sigurdur as a test to see whether "Sabu" had really as good skills and people as he claimed, it is believed that communications between "Sabu" and Sigurdur escalated after the CIA attack,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rt.com/news/cia-site-claims-attack-807/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public appearance==
In November 2013 Sigurdur went to Norway to speak about his journey for the organization YATA. This is the first and only known time that Sigurdur has spoken about his story in public, except in media interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hvordan en 17-åring ender opp hos Wikileaks og FBI - YATA Norge|url = http://yata.no/hvordan-en-17-aring-ender-opp-hos-wikileaks-og-fbi/|website = YATA Norge|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prison convictions==
In 2012 Sigurdur was questioned about sexual misconduct, accused of purchasing sex from a seventeen year old teenager. At the time Sigurdur was 18 years old. Sigurdur denied the charges but was found guilty in late 2013 and received 8 months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Siggi hakkari dæmdur fyrir að misnota dreng - DV|url = http://www.dv.is/frettir/2013/11/19/siggi-braut-sautjan-ara-pilt-WRMWNX/|website = DV|access-date = 2016-01-14|language = is-IS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 WikiLeaks filed criminal charges against Sigurdur for embezzlement. Sigurdur denied the charges and the case was later dismissed. He was later arrested in the summer of 2013 on charges of financial fraud. At that time the WikiLeaks case was brought back up, and Sigurdur was indicted on charges of embezzlement and financial fraud. In 2014 Sigurdur was ordered to pay WikiLeaks 7 million ISK (roughly $55,000) as well as being sentenced to prison for 2 years for embezzlement and financial fraud. Sigurdur plead guilty to all counts.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.visir.is/grunadur-ad-minnsta-kosti-um-tiu-milljon-krona-fjarsvik/article/2013130609696|title = Grunaður að minnsta kosti um tíu milljón króna svik|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In those cases Sigurdur was ordered to pay the victims 15 million ISK (roughly $115.000),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sigurdur received a two-year prison sentence in those cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vísir - Siggi "The Hacker" receives a two year prison sentence|url = http://www.visir.is/siggi--the-hacker--receives-a-two-year-prison-sentence/article/2014141229831|website = visir.is|access-date = 2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Sigurdur was arrested for trying to blackmail a large Icelandic candy factory, it then turned out that Sigurdur had no involvement in that scheme at all and the case was later dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vísir - Mál á hendur Sigga hakkara fellt niður - tveir aðrir grunaðir um að kúga fé út úr Nóa Síríus|url = http://www.visir.is/mal-a-hendur-sigga-hakkara-fellt-nidur---tveir-adrir-grunadir-um-ad-kuga-fe-ut-ur-noa-sirius/article/2013130829738|website = visir.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 Sigurdur was arrested on charges of sex crimes. He was believed to be a flight risk and possibly sabotaging the investigation and therefore placed in solitary confinement for six weeks. An indictment was later issued and Sigurdur was charged with purchasing sex from a minor and purchasing sex. Initially 11 charges were filed but only nine made it to an indictment. Five of the charges were purchasing sex from a minor and four were purchasing sex from an adult. The victims ranged from the age of 15-20, all male, during which Sigurdur was 18-21. Sigurdur plead guilty to all counts and received 3 years for that,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Siggi hakkari grunaður um alvarleg kynferðisbrot gegn nokkrum piltum|url = http://www.pressan.is/Frettir/Lesa_Innlent/siggi-hakkari-grunadur-um-alvarleg-kynferdisbrot-gegn-nokkrum-piltum?pressandate=20140214|website = Pressan.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Siggi hakkari grunaður um 11 kynferðisbrot|url = http://www.ruv.is/frett/siggi-hakkari-grunadur-um-11-kynferdisbrot|website = RÚV|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sigurður grunaður um fleiri kynferðisbrot|url = http://www.ruv.is/frett/sigurdur-grunadur-um-fleiri-kynferdisbrot|website = RÚV|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sigurdur negotiated the damages to his victims and paid 8.6 million ISK (roughly $66,000) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Siggi hakkari þarf að greiða hátt í tíu milljónir í miskabætur - DV|url = http://www.dv.is/frettir/2015/9/25/siggi-hakkari-tharf-ad-greida-hatt-i-tiu-milljonir-i-miskabaetur/|website = DV|access-date = 2016-01-14|language = is-IS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vísir - Siggi hakkari í þriggja ára fangelsi fyrir kynferðisbrot gegn níu drengjum|url = http://www.visir.is/siggi-hakkari-i-thriggja-ara-fangelsi-fyrir-kynferdisbrot-gegn-niu-drengjum/article/2015150929238|website = visir.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vísir - Dómurinn yfir Sigga hakkara: Bauð unglingspiltum allt að 100 milljónir, bíla og einbýlishús|url = http://www.visir.is/domurinn-yfir-sigga-hakkara--baud-unglingspiltum-allt-ad-100-milljonir,-bila-og-einbylishus/article/2015150929149|website = visir.is|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sigurdur started to serve his sentence of 6 years in 2014. He is incarcerated in [[Litla-Hraun]], Iceland's only maximum security prison, which is located 30 minutes outside of Reykjavik.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fangelsið Litla-Hrauni {{!}} Fangelsi.is|url = http://www.fangelsi.is/fangelsi-rikisins/fangelsid-litla-hrauni/|website = www.fangelsi.is|access-date = 2016-01-19|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160127112748/http://www.fangelsi.is/fangelsi-rikisins/fangelsid-litla-hrauni|archivedate = 2016-01-27|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sigurdur has been ordered to pay roughly 31 millions ISK (roughly $236,000) in total damages. According to reports the sum has been paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Siggi hakkari þarf að greiða fullt af fólki skaðabætur - Nútíminn|url = http://nutiminn.is/siggi-hakkari-tharf-ad-greida-fullt-af-folki-skadabaetur/|website = Nútíminn|access-date = 2016-01-14|language = is-IS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The objects and purpose of the Sons of Confederate Veterans is "to encourage the preservation of history, perpetuate the hallowed memories of brave men, to assist in the observance of [[Confederate Memorial Day]], to aid and support all members, and to perpetuate the record of the services of every Southern soldier".&lt;ref name="Hopkins1926" /&gt;

==Eligibility==
Male descendants of those who served in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] armed forces, or one of the States thereof, to the [[Conclusion of the American Civil War|end of the war]], died in [[Prisoner-of-war camp|prison]] or while in actual service, were [[Killed in action|killed in battle]], or were honorably retired or [[Military discharge|discharged]] are eligible for membership. Membership can be obtained through either [[Lineal descendant|lineal]] or collateral family lines. [[Kinship]] to a veteran must be documented [[Genealogy|genealogically]]. The minimum age for full membership is 12 years, but there is no minimum for [[Cadet]] membership.&lt;ref name="scv-membership" /&gt;

==History==

===Founding===
Forty [[delegate]]s from 24 camps and societies from the various [[Southern United States|Southern states]] were called by the R. E. Lee Camp, No. 1, [[United Confederate Veterans|Confederate Veterans]] (also known as United Confederate Veterans), of Richmond, Virginia, to meet on June 30 and July 1, 1896, at the City Auditorium (present-day [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] (VCU) Cary Street Gym),&lt;ref name="Shaw1997" /&gt; for the purpose of forming a ″national organization, adopting a constitution similar in every respect to that governing the United Confederate Veterans, and permanently organized under the name United Sons of Confederate Veterans″ (USCV). The preamble to the United Sons of Confederate Veterans Constitution reads in part: ″To encourage the preservation of history, perpetuate the hallowed memories of brave men, to assist in the observance of Memorial Day, and to perpetuate the record of the services of every Southern soldier″. Its aims, objects, and purposes are ″not to create or foster, in any manner, any feeling against the North, but to hand down to posterity the story of the glory of the men who wore the gray″.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |editor-last=Hopkins |editor-first=Walter Lee |date=1926 |title=Year Book and Minutes of the Thirty-First Annual Convention of the Sons of Confederate Veterans in the City of Birmingham, Ala., May 18–21, 1926 |url=https://archive.org/details/yearbookminuteso31sons |location=Richmond, Va. |publisher=Dudley Printing Co. |pages=102–105 |lccn=2005204063 |oclc=11733530 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 1, the delegates elected Mr. J. E. B. Stuart, of [[Newport News, Virginia]], son of the famous cavalry leader, [[List of commanders-in-chief of the Sons of Confederate Veterans|commander-in-chief]] of the United Sons of Confederate Veterans.&lt;ref name="Shaw1997" /&gt;

===Constitutional crisis===
In the 1990s, disagreements over the purpose of the organization emerged within the Sons of Confederate Veterans. At issue was an alleged shift in the Sons of Confederate Veterans's mission from "maintaining gravestones, erecting monuments and studying [[American Civil War|Civil War]] history" to more issue-centric concerns. The Sons of Confederate Veterans's new concerns included "fight[ing] for the right to [[Modern display of the Confederate flag#Revival and controversy|display Confederate symbols]] everywhere from schools to statehouses".&lt;ref name="faction"&gt;Dan Gearino, "A Thin Gray Line", ''The News and Observer'' (Raleigh, NC), August 28, 2002; Tracy Rose, [http://www.mountainx.com/news/2003/0205sons.php "The War Between the Sons: Members fight for control of Confederate group"].

Members of the more traditionalist camp alleged that the [[League of the South]] had influenced their organization's new direction. One ally of the activist wing claimed that thousands of Sons of Confederate Veterans members are also League of the South members. News reports state that the activists advocate "picketing, aggressive lobbying, issue campaigning and lawsuits" in favor of what they term "heritage defense" to prevent "heritage violations".&lt;ref name="faction"/&gt; The Sons of Confederate Veterans defines those as "any attack upon our Confederate Heritage, or the flags, monuments, and symbols which represent it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scv.org/heritageReporting.php|title=Reporting a Heritage Violation|date=July 10, 2007|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=2 December 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710212512/http://www.scv.org/heritageReporting.php|archivedate=July 10, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Sons of Confederate Veterans' dissidents formed a new organization, Save the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SSCV), composed of members and former members of SCV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savethescv.org/Introduction.htm|title=SSCV Introduction|website=Savethescv.org|accessdate=2 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060806161141/http://savethescv.org/Introduction.htm|archivedate=August 6, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Save the Sons of Confederate Veterans co-founder Walter Charles Hilderman, "about a hundred or so individuals and groups identified themselves on the Save the Sons of Confederate Veterans web site as supporting Save the SCV" not long after the group was founded, though the current membership numbers for the Save the Sons of Confederate Veterans are not available.&lt;ref name=T&amp;D102504&gt;''The Times and Democrat'', interview of Walter Charles Hilderman, October 25, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd Cathey reported in the ''Southern Mercury'' that most of the dissension had ended by 2003, and the majority of the members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans agreed with the heritage preservation activities espoused by the new Sons of Confederate Veterans leadership.&lt;ref name=Cathey022005&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cathey |first=Boyd D. |title=Principles and Priorities: The Sons of Confederate Veterans and the Battle for Southern Culture |journal=Southern Mercury |volume=3 |issue=1 |date=February 2005 |pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main figures in that new Sons of Confederate Veterans leadership, South Carolina politician and investment advisor [[Ron Wilson (politician)|Ron Wilson]], served as commander-in-chief from 2002 to 2004. In 2012, he was sentenced to prison for running a [[Ponzi scheme]] as part of his investment business; ironically, among those he defrauded were members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sc/pr/ron-wilson-receives-additional-prison-time |title=Ron Wilson Receives Additional Prison Time |website=justice.gov |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2005, the Sons of Confederate Veterans General Executive Council sued to expel Commander-in-Chief Dennis Sweeney from office. The court initially granted the council temporary control of the organization, but its final decision returned power to Sweeney. Thirteen of the twenty-five council members were expelled from the council shortly after Sweeney regained control. Nine of the council members expelled were former commanders-in-chief, a status that heretofore had come with a life membership on the council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Cameron |last=McWhirter |title=Gray vs. Gray: Factions in Sons of Confederate Veterans exchange salvos in latest Civil War battleground |work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=October 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Deborah |last=Fitts |title=SCV Supports Leaders And Ousts Dissidents |work=Civil War News |date=June 2005 |url=http://www.civilwarnews.com/archive/articles/SVC_turmoil.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042210/http://www.civilwarnews.com/archive/articles/SVC_turmoil.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February, Cathey wrote in the ''Southern Mercury'' that most of the Sons of Confederate Veterans's members had united against the War on Southern Culture.&lt;ref name=Cathey022005/&gt; By the SCV's summer 2005 convention, activists firmly controlled the council. They severed much of the Sons of Confederate Veterans' long-standing relationship with the more traditionalist [[Military Order of the Stars and Bars]] (MOSB). The MOSB, founded in 1938, had been closely involved with the Sons of Confederate Veterans, sharing its headquarters since 1992 and co-publishing ''Southern Mercury''. The Military Order of the Stars and Bars Commander General, Daniel Jones, citing "the continuing political turmoil within the SCV", moved the Military Order of the Stars and Bars out of the shared quarters, ended the joint magazine publishing enterprise, and separated the two organizations' finances. In 2006, for the first time, the two organizations held separate conventions.&lt;ref name=DJonesLtr&gt;[http://216.239.51.104/search?q=cache:7cypSVfHys8J:mosbihq.org/2006%2520General%2520Convention/5-22-06%2520Letter%2520from%2520Dan%2520to%2520Membership.pdf+mosb+scv&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=39] {{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
[[File:Memorial for Confederate sacrifices, Baxley, GA, US.jpg|right|thumb|Memorial erected by the SCV in [[Baxley, Georgia]]]]
In 2011, the Mississippi Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, launched a campaign to honor Confederate Lieutenant-General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest|Nathan B. Forrest]] with a specialty license plate. The same year, the organization awarded Arizona Sheriff [[Joe Arpaio]] its "Law and Order" award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/02/14/mississippi.kkk.controversy/|title=Mississippi governor asked to denounce attempts to honor KKK leader|author=Antoinette Campbell|website=Cnn.com|accessdate=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the [[Texas|State of Texas]] denied a request for a [[Confederate Battle Flag]] specialty license plate, a decision later upheld in State court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20131106-appeals-court-to-hear-texas-dispute-over-confederate-flag-license-plate.ece|title=Appeals court hears Texas dispute over Confederate flag license plate|date=November 6, 2013|website=Dallasnews.com|accessdate=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That state court decision was later overturned in Federal court, and the matter was ultimately heard by the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Walker v.

The [[Virginia General Assembly]] had approved a specialty license plate for the Sons of Confederate Veterans in 1999, but lawmakers forbade the group from displaying the Confederate insignia. The organization sued for the right to display the Confederate Battle Flag on the license plate, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|4th Circuit Court of Appeals]] eventually upheld the organization's [[First Amendment]] rights. Specialty plates containing a small Confederate Battle Flag had been offered in Virginia ever since a Federal judge issued a 2001 injunction ruling that banning them would be discriminating against the Sons of Confederate Veterans and limiting their First Amendment right to free speech. In a highly controversial move, Virginia Governor [[Terry McAuliffe]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], announced that the Commonwealth intended to phase out the state-sponsored specialty license plate six days after a racially charged shooting at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina ignited protests against the display of the Confederate Battle Flag and other Confederate symbols. More than 1,600 Virginians had the license plates displaying the confederate flag on their vehicles, and the SOCV challenged the governor's authority to recall the license plates, citing the 2001 injunction, and in a letter addressed to Virginia DMV Commissioner Richard Holcomb and forwarded to the governor, Sons of Confederate Veterans Commander Tracy Clary wrote: "I am aware of no order from the 4th Circuit vacating our right to receive our plates from the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles and on behalf of ALL the citizens of the Commonwealth I insist that you follow the rule of Law." But in August 2015 the Federal judge dissolved the 2001 injunction, referencing the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Texas case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wtvr.com/2015/06/30/sons-of-confederate-veterans-challenge-gov-mcauliffes-authority/|title=Sons of Confederate Veterans challenge Gov. McAuliffe's authority|date=June 30, 2015|website=Wtvr.com|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the ruling, hundreds of members of the Sons of Confedertate Veterans who had the specialty plates refused to remove them from their vehicles and exchange them for new plates despite the fact that the specialty plates displaying the Confederate insignia were no longer valid after October 4, 2015, and it is a class 2 [[misdemeanor]] to drive with a cancelled license plate in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wtkr.com/2015/10/15/suffolk-mans-passion-for-confederate-flag-could-get-him-in-trouble-with-police/|title=Suffolk man's passion for Confederate flag could get him in trouble with police|date=October 15, 2015|website=Wtkr.com|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/virginia-confederate-flag-license-plates-recall-rejected-hundreds-drivers-2146415|title=Virginia Confederate Flag License Plates Recall Rejected By Hundreds Of Drivers|date=October 19, 2015|website=Ibtimes.com|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jefferson Davis Highway]] marker in [[Vancouver, Washington]], was removed from its prominent location in the city in the late 1990s, to an outcry from the local Northwest Chapter of Sons of Confederate Veterans.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/14/us/road-named-for-jefferson-davis-stirs-spirited-debate.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss#|title=Road Named for Jefferson Davis Stirs Spirited Debate|accessdate=May 8, 2009 | work=The New York Times | date=February 14, 2002|quote=Another granite marker proclaiming the road's designation as the Jefferson Davis Highway was erected at the time in Vancouver, Wash., at the highway's southern terminus.

Vancouver city officials continued to pressure for the removal of the stone from any public property so in 2007, the local chapter of Sons of Confederate Veterans purchased land outside nearby [[Ridgefield, Washington]]. They placed the marker stone facing busy Interstate 5 with large Confederate flags surrounding it on prominent display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scvportland.org/jdp_park.html|title=History of the Jefferson Davis Park|website=Scvportland.org|accessdate=October 30, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828062427/http://www.scvportland.org/jdp_park.html|archivedate=August 28, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scvportland.org/jdp_index.html|title=Jefferson Davis Park|website=Scvportland.org|accessdate=October 30, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723181731/http://www.scvportland.org/jdp_index.html|archivedate=July 23, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This brought outcries but little could be done by either the nearby town of Ridgefield or the county,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thereflector.com/news/article_2af35a16-ad35-11e7-a067-43ff7ebcde80.html|title=Confederate monument taken off county historic register |work=The Reflector|last=Bannan|first=Rick|date=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it was located on private property; the prominent location and events in other parts of the nation still make this [[Jefferson Davis Park, Washington|park]] the local focus of strong emotions, especially in the aftermath of the white nationalist [[Unite the Right rally]] in August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Jamie|date=August 16, 2015|url=http://www.kptv.com/story/36153519/some-calling-for-removal-of-confederate-flag-at-ridgefield-park|title=Some calling for removal of Confederate flag at Ridgefield park|work=Fox12 News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Westneat|first=Danny|date=June 24, 2015|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/confederate-flag-is-flying-here-too-along-i-5/|title=Confederate flag is flying here, too, along I-5 |work=[[The Seattle Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vandalism of the stones on August 17, 2017, raised concern for the park managed by SVC, one marker was covered in black tar or paint and the other was covered in red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Littman|first=Adam|date=August 18, 2017|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2017/aug/18/paint-splashed-on-confederate-monuments-in-ridgefield/|title=Confederate monuments in Ridgefield defaced|work=The Columbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2017, the city of Ridgefield formally asked the county historical society to remove the marker from the register and the vote was unanimous to do so, 6–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Solomon|first=Molly|date=October 4, 2017|url=http://kuow.org/post/clark-county-removes-confederate-monument-historic-registry|title=Clark County Removes Confederate Monument From Historic Registry |work=KUOW News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vogt102017&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2017/oct/03/historic-commission-votes-to-remove-davis-memorial-from-registry/|title=Commission votes to remove Davis marker from register|date=October 3, 2017|accessdate=October 18, 2017|last=Vogt|first=Tom|website=Columbian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization took a more active approach after both the election of President Donald Trump in 2017, and moves by some municipalities to remove Confederate monuments and flags from public places because of their racist symbolism and historical connection to white supremacy movements. The organization began installing large Confederate battle "mega flags" on private property overlooking major highways, a project they called "Flags Across the Carolinas". In January 2018 the North Carolina chapter vowed to install one flag in every county. Anti-racist activists, such as Roland Stanton, criticized the project: Stanton, president of the Durham branch of the North Carolina National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), said the Confederate flag: "is a symbol of oppression, genocide and slavery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com/news/local/counties/durham-county/article198175599.html|title=Group plans to fly 100 Confederate battle flags across NC. One for every county.|website=Heraldsun.com|accessdate=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanton described the project as "abominable and shameful" while acknowledging that the mega flag project activities were protected by the First Amendment.

==Mechanized Cavalry==
In 1997, a Sons of Confederate Veterans [[Motorcycle club|motorcycle organization]] was formed by Maryland attorney Reuben Hamby. According to the group's official history, the "SCV Mechanized Cavalry" are members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans who ride motorcycles. Like the parent group, their by-laws forbid racism and their purpose is the preservation of the history of the Civil War, honoring their ancestors who took part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.csascvmc.org/about-us.html |title=  Mechanized Cavalry Heritage Defense About Us |website=csascvmc.org|access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bonnie Blue Society==
[[File:Bonnie Blue flag of the Confederate States of America.svg|thumb|175px|Bonnie Blue Flag]]
The Sons of Confederate Veterans also sponsors the Bonnie Blue Society for authors of southern literature dealing with the veterans of the Confederate States of America. Thus, the Bonnie Blue Society is a recognition and award for persons who have perpetuated the memory of the Confederate soldier or sailor in literary form. Accepted members of the [[literary society]] have researched, written and published a book or article on the Confederacy for the general public. A copy of the book or article will be sent to the permanent collection of the Major General [[William David McCain]] Library at the general headquarters of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scv.org/new/forms-and-documents/bonnie-blue-society-application/ |title=Bonnie Blue Society Application |website=scv.org |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject matter of the written items presented to the Bonnie Blue Society should be written according to the heritage goals of the SOCV by being neither anti-Confederate nor racist. The society uses a version of the Confederacy's [[Bonnie Blue Flag]] as their official membership insignia. This banner was an early, although unofficial, flag of the Confederate States, consisting of a single white star on a dark blue field.

The '''State Security Service'''&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;{{lang-sh|Služba državne sigurnosti}}, Служба државне безбедности; {{lang-mk|Служба за државна безбедност}}; {{lang-sl|Služba državne varnosti}}&lt;/ref&gt; (SDB or SDS), more commonly known by its original name as the '''State Security Administration'''&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;{{lang-sh|Uprava državne sigurnosti}}, Управа државне безбедности; {{lang-mk|Управа за државна безбедност}}; {{lang-sl|Uprava državne varnosti}}&lt;/ref&gt; (UDBA or UDSA), was the [[secret police]] organization of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Best known at all times simply by the acronym '''UDBA''',&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The acronym "UDBA" is derived from the organization's original name in the [[Serbian language|Serbian variant]] of the [[Serbo-Croatian language]]: "''Uprava državne bezbednosti''" ("State Security Administration"); the additional "A" for "''armije''" ("of the Army") signified its being part the [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav Army]]. The acronyms '''SDB''' (Serbian variant) or '''SDS''' (Croatian variant) were used officially after the organization was renamed into "State Security Service".&lt;/ref&gt; in its latter decades it was composed of six semi-independent secret police organizations—one for each of the six Yugoslav federal republics—coordinated by the central federal office.

Although it operated with more restraint than other secret police agencies in the [[communist]] dictatorships of [[Eastern Europe]], the UDBA was nonetheless a feared tool of control. It is alleged that the UDBA was responsible for the "eliminations" of dozens of enemies of the state within Yugoslavia and internationally (estimates about 200 assassinations and kidnappings). Eliminations vary from those of World War II [[Ustaše]] Croat leaders [[Ante Pavelić]] and [[Vjekoslav Luburić]] (in [[Spain]] and [[Argentina]]), to Croatian emigrant writer [[Bruno Bušić]] and Serbian emigrant writer [[Dragiša Kašiković]].&lt;ref name = "schindler"&gt;{{citation |first=John |last =Schindler |title =Doctor of Espionage: The Victims of UDBA |publisher = Slobodna Bosna |date = February 4, 2010 |pages =35–38 |place=Sarajevo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], the breakaway republics went on to form their own [[secret police]] agencies, while the [[State Security Service (FR Yugoslavia)|State Security Service]] of the [[Serbia and Montenegro|FR Yugoslavia]] kept its UDBA-era name.

== Functions ==
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Vitomirmisimovic.PNG|thumb|right|220px|[[Vitomir Misimoviċ]] (taken in the late 1970s) was an UDBA agent that posed as Vitomir Virkez in [[Australia]] to gain the trust of [[Croatia]]n contacts later named the [[Croatian Six]] whom he later admitted to framing]] --&gt;

UDBA formed a major part of the Yugoslav intelligence services from 1946-1991, and was primarily responsible for internal [[state security]]. After 1946 the UDB underwent numerous security and intelligence changes due to topical issues at that time, including: fighting gangs; protection of the economy; [[Cominform]]/[[Informbiro]]; and bureaucratic aspirations. In 1945 and 1946, for instance, the UDB was organized into districts. In 1950, when the administrative-territorial units were abolished as authorities,&lt;ref&gt;see the Act on abolishing of authority, LRS Off. Gazette no. 4/51&lt;/ref&gt; the UDB was reorganized again. During this period the intelligence and security activities concentrated less on intelligence and more on internal security. There was an emphasis on [[collectivism]], brotherhood, social harmony, loyalty, and tolerance towards those with different views. Deviation from this set of values became an immediate issue for security services.

Later, the use of force was mitigated and when the process of "decentralization of people's power" began, intelligence and security services underwent further reorganization in order to decentralise power and increase effectiveness. The Act on Internal Affairs&lt;ref&gt;FNRJ Off. Gaz. No. 30/56&lt;/ref&gt; and the Decree on Organization of State Internal Affairs Secretariat regulated the intelligence security authority as the prerogative of the State Security Directorate within the Ministry of the Interior. The following reorganization addressed issues relating to the competence of the federation (state security, cross-border traffic, foreign citizens, passports, introduction and dissemination of foreign press, and federal citizenship).

== Structure ==
Intelligence and security activity was organized in the following manner:

* After [[OZNA]] ({{lang|sr-Cyrl|Одељење заштите народа}} / Odeljenje zaštite naroda) (En:Department for the People's Protection) was abolished, intelligence activity was divided among various federal ministries: the Federal Ministry of the Interior by the State Security Administration, and the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the [[Service for Research and Documentation]] (SID) which collected foreign political information; military-defense intelligence was handled by the GS 2nd Department - [[KOS (Yugoslavia)|KOS]] (Kontraobaveštajna služba / {{lang|sr-Cyrl|Контраобавештајна служба}} / Counterintelligence Service) of [[Yugoslav People's Army]].
* SDB in the republics was not autonomous, but was tied to the federal service which co-ordinated the work and issued instructions.
* State security was regulated by secret legislation (secret Official Gazette), which prescribed the use of special operations. The SDB performed house searches, covert interceptions inside the premises, telecommunications interception, covert surveillance of people, and covert interception of letters and other consignments.
* Of primary interest to the SDB was domestic security; identifying and obstructing activities of the "domestic enemy" (i.e. the "bourgeois rightwing", clericalists, members of the [[Cominform]], nationalists, and [[separatists]]). Intelligence work abroad was deemed less important and was under federal control.
* The SDB was a "political police", answerable to the party organization from which it received its guidelines and to which it reported. The SDB was so deeply rooted in the political system that one of its tasks was the preparation of "Political Security Assessments"; that is, assessments on literally all spheres of life.
* During its activity, the SDB enjoyed a wide range of power, including classical police powers (identifications, interrogations, and arrests).
* The SDB organization was constantly changing and making improvements, but it remained tied to the central unit in republic capitals and smaller working groups in the field. All information and data flowed into the central unit in the capitals and sent on from there to the users. Field groups had working contacts with the local authorities, but did not answer to them.

==Activities==

===1946–1986 period===
From 1963–1974, security intelligence services dealt with a series of domestic and foreign political events. At home, there were political confrontation both before and after the Brioni Plenum (1966), liberal flareups and massive leftist [[student demonstrations in Belgrade in 1968]], ''Hrvatsko proljeće'' (Croatian Spring) or "[[MASPOK]]" (mass movement) in [[Croatia]] in 1971, a nationalist incursion of the [[Bugojno group]] at Raduša (1972), and a revival of nationalism in Yugoslav republics. The most significant event abroad was the invasion of the [[Warsaw Pact]] troops into [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1968.

These were the circumstances at the time the first act on internal affairs of the individual republics was adopted in 1967. According to this act, internal affairs were handled directly by the municipal administrative bodies and the secretariats of internal affairs of each republic or by their provincial bodies. This was the first time since 1945 that republics gained control and greater influence over their individual security organs and intelligence security services.

The State Security Service (SDB) was defined by law as a professional service within the Republic Secretariat of Internal Affairs (RSUP). Naturally, most of its competence remained within federal institutions, as prescribed by the Act on Handling Internal Affairs Under Competence of Federal Administrative Bodies (1971), which determined that the federal secretariat of internal affairs coordinate the work of the SDB in the republics and provinces. Further steps were taken with the transformation of state administration, adoption of the Federal Act on State Administration (1978), and the Republic Act (1978). The newly adopted act on internal affairs tasked the Republic Secretariat of Internal Affairs (RSUP) with state security issues, which then became RSUP issues and were no longer given special handling "at the RSUP". This resolution remained in force until the 1991 modifications of the act on internal affairs.

===Post–1986 period===
The role of intelligence and security changed after 1986, when a different mentality reigned within the Party and the processes of democratization were initiated. Intelligence security agencies came under attack, and many people started publicly writing about and criticizing the SDB. There were no more taboo subjects. The party organization was abolished in the SDB and the first attempts to introduce parliamentary control began.

The appointment of a commission to monitor the work was one of the most absurd decisions made by the country's intelligence security services during the era of "social democracy", since SDB activity was regulated by federal legislation and regulations published in the secret Official Gazettes. Neither the commission members nor its president had access to these Acts. It was difficult to evaluate information, since the commission had no investigative powers or capability to verify information. The head of the service was tasked simply to deliver requested information, even classified, to the commission. The SDB was also still receiving tasks from the Party, although the supervising commission lacked the powers to control those tasks. The above-mentioned events undermined the unity of the SDB, which formulated its own, unpublished regulations (sub-legal acts, ordinances, etc.). This made any protest about violation of rights impossible, as the regulations were inaccessible to the public.

The first democratic multi party elections in 1990, which enhanced the process of democratization, reverberated within the Federal Secretariat of Internal Affairs (SSUP) and Federal State Security Service (SSDB), which were fighting to maintain control over the individual SDBs in the republics. The latter became increasingly disunited; it was still legally connected to the federal bodies, but was becoming aware of the fact that it operated and worked in their particular republic. Some professional cadres, especially those in the "domestic field" (dealing with the "bourgeois right wing", clericalists, and student movements), began leaving the service. Conflict was increasing, and SDB archives were being systematically destroyed. In its search for new roles, the SDBs also began to limit information they were sending to the SSDB. It ultimately restricted its information to foreign intelligence services.

Along with the weakening of the SSDB position, attempts were made by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] Security Service or [[KOS (Yugoslavia)|KOS]] to strengthen its own strongholds in the different republics and in the individual SDBs. The attempts failed because they depended upon cadres of other nationalities still employed in the SDBs but who had no access to data bases and had no decision-making power due to their "Yugoslav" orientation.

Recently released files contain information on 1 million citizens of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia and other former Yugoslav republics, whose files the UDBA in Slovenia kept records. In 2003 and 2010, it was to possible to see the names of the UDBA agents in Slovenia, some of whom are still active in the Slovenian Military and the Ministry of Interior, at the website udba.net. The government of Slovenia promptly demanded the removal of pages from the website, so they are currently not accessible.

'''''The Frankenfood Myth: How Protest and Politics Threaten the Biotech Revolution''''' is a book written by [[Hoover Institution]] [[research]] fellow [[Henry I. Miller]] and [[List of political scientists|political scientist]] Gregory Conko and published by [[Praeger Publishers]] [[Publishing|published]] in 2004.  In it Conko argues against over-regulation of [[genetically modified food]] and it features a foreword by [[Nobel Peace Prize]]-winner [[Norman Borlaug|Norman Ernest Borlaug]].&lt;ref&gt;[The author] argues that excess regulation of genetically modified food unnecessarily frightens the public and impedes research. Erika Jonietz, [http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=13775&amp;ch=biotech ''Technology Review'', September 15, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Conko described ''Frankenfood Myth'' as follows:

:"It's not a point-by-point refutation of all the misconceptions that are being spread about agricultural biotechnology. The primary mess that we tackle has to do with an attitude that is being spread by both opponents of [[biotechnology]] and by a lot of its supporters that it is somehow uniquely risky and therefore should be subject to special caution and special regulatory oversight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/13775/ |accessdate=June 8, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Barron's'' reviewer wrote:
:"The heated debate over so-called Frankenfoods is not only about the pros and cons of genetically manipulating crops to improve their nutritional value and resistance to disease; it also concerns [[intellectual honesty]]. For years, activists opposed to the new science have been spreading unfounded and inaccurate horror stories, threatening to derail progress vitally needed to feed the world. ''The Frankenfood Myth'' by Henry Miller and Gregory Conko takes a long, hard look at both the new [[agricultural biotechnology]] and the [[policy debate]] surrounding it."{{fact|date=March 2015}}

The '''United National Liberation Front''' (UNLF), also known as the '''United National Liberation Front of Manipur,'''&lt;ref name="T–Nitin"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A life roughed–out in the jungle |url=http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main14.asp?filename=Ne100105A_life_roughed.asp |author=Nitin A.

==Background==
The United Nation Liberation Front's movement manifested as a result of several similar movements of the same political agenda. The outfit was founded on 24 November 1964&lt;ref name="T–Nitin"/&gt; with the following key personalities as its central committee members:

# Kalalung Kamei, President
# Thankhopao Singsit, Vice-President
# Arambam Samarendra, General Secretary
# Longjam Manimohan, Member
# Laishram Kanhai, Member
# Nongmeikapam Sanajaoba, Member
# [[Nongmaithem Pahari]], Member

==Ideology and Aim==
{{Quote box|width=15em|align=right|quote=UNLF have nothing to demand from the [[Government of India]] but instead it is fighting to regain the lost sovereignty [of Manipur].|source=UNLF&lt;ref name="Sify–28Sep"/&gt;|salign=right}}
The [[National Investigation Agency]] (NIA), in September 2012, acknowledged that "the activities carried out by the United National Liberation Front (UNLF) are for bringing [[sovereignty]] in the state of Manipur." The UNLF has viewed the statement as "a big political victory."&lt;ref name="Sify–28Sep"&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=UNLF activities are for bringing sovereignty in Manipur |url=http://www.samachar.com/unlf-activities-are-for-bring-sovereignty-in-manipur-nia-mj4ci8chggb.html |newspaper=[[Imphal Free Press]] |publisher=Sify |date=28 September 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNLF chairperson, R. K. Meghan ''alias'' Sanayaima, has been charged for "waging war" against India by the NIA, but the UNLF leader has voiced that the UNLF does not view India or its [[army]] as enemies, and "the UNLF only resist the Indian armed forces stationed in Manipur and to resist those people who engaged in [[Colonialism|colonial]] [[Political repression|repression]]."&lt;ref name="Sify–28Sep"/&gt;

Sanayaima believes that Manipur is "under [[martial law]]," and has questioned the character and worthiness of the elections that had been held in Manipur. He further believes that "the most [[democracy|democratic]] means to resolve [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] is [[plebiscite]]."&lt;ref name="Sify–28Sep"/&gt;

==Organisation==
The UNLF is one of the oldest insurgent organisation in the Northeast India. E. N. Rammohan, the former [[Director General]] of the [[Border Security Force]], once wrote, "Of the five major (Imphal) valley underground groups, the UNLF's ideology is by and large intact. The senior leadership is well educated and has good organisational control."&lt;ref name="T–Nitin"/&gt;

===Manipur People's Army===
Manipur People's Army was formed on 9 February 1987 as an Army Wing of UNLF. In 1991, the UNLF picked up arms, and its first armed action against IOF carried on 15 December of 1991 at Lamdan on a CRPF Convoy. In 2005, the strength of the MPA was estimated to about 2,000 armed cadres.&lt;ref name="T–Nitin"/&gt; According to the UNLF, by 2005, the UNLF was engaged in battle against about 50,000 armed personnel from the [[Indian Army]], that are deployed against the organisation in the forest regions of Manipur.&lt;ref name="T–Peace"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Want peace? travel the roads not taken |url=http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main14.asp?filename=Ne100105Want_peace.asp |author=Nitin A. Gokhale |publisher=[[Tehelka]] |location=Hong Kong |date=1 October 2005 |accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cadres of the group are drawn largely from the [[Meitei people|Meiteis]].

The territory inhabited by the Nagas, consisting of four districts of [[Manipur]], is the operating ground of [[Naga people|Naga]] groups such as the NSCNs, who are predominantly Christian. The Imphal valley, consisting of four districts, is the operating ground of Meiteis groups such as [[People's Liberation Army of Manipur|PLA]] and [[PREPAK]], who predominantly follow [[Vaishnav]] [[Hinduism]].

==Strategy and Tactics==
The UNLF is known to be heavily involved with Extortion, Arms Trading, and Income Generating Projects to finance their armed movements.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} They have several organized training camps within the northeast sector of India and the neighbouring countries of Myanmar and Bangladesh.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Ningtam Meira is the primary media outlet they use to make publications.

===Four–point proposal to Indian government===
The UNLF had put forward four [[condiciones sine quibus non]] before the government of India if it is willing to initiate dialogue and ink a peace accord with the organisation, which are:&lt;ref name="T–Peace"/&gt;
#"A plebiscite under [[UN]] supervision to elicit the people's opinion on the core issue of restoration of Manipur's independence."
#"Deployment of a [[UN Peacekeeping Forces|UN peacekeeping force]] in Manipur to ensure the process is free and fair."
#"Surrender of arms by the UNLF to the UN force, matched by the withdrawal of Indian troops."
#"Handing over of [[political power]] by the UN in accordance with the results of the plebiscite."

==Arrest of chairperson==
On 4 December 2010, Sanayaima was produced by the NIA, who claimed to have arrested Sanayaima from [[Motihari]] in [[Bihar]]; while, Sanayaima has proclaimed that he was abducted by the Bangladeshi agencies on 29 September 2010 and "handed over" to the agencies of India. Sanayaima has been booked by the NIA for "waging war against the Indian Union under section 120 (B) [[Indian Penal Code|IPC]], 121, 121 (A), 122 IPC and 16, 17, 18, 18 (A), 18 (B) &amp; 20 [[Unlawful Activities Prevention Act]], 1967 as amended in 2008."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Sanayaima to be produced in court |url=http://www.samachar.com/Sanayaima-to-be-produced-in-court-mixsONbhhai.html |newspaper=[[Imphal Free Press]] |publisher=Sify |date=22 August 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the arrest, he said that "in a multi-community region, the idea of peace cannot be achieved without considering the collateral damages of the secondary conflict that emerges out of the meaningless peace process."&lt;ref name="Sify–8Nov"/&gt;
{{Quotation|The Indian government ploy in the so called peace process in 'Western South East Asia' (WESIA) [Indian northeast region] is aimed at transforming the conflict between the peoples of the region with the government of India into a [[Ethnic conflict|conflict between the peoples on ethnic lines]].| Sanayaima, in 2012&lt;ref name="Sify–8Nov"&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=India transforming conflict on ethnic lines |url=http://www.samachar.com/India-transforming-conflict-on-ethnic-lines-mloiMEifiei.html |newspaper=[[Imphal Free Press]] |publisher=Sify |date=8 November 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Drawing inspiration from the "charged political atmosphere" during the "[[Naxalite–Maoist insurgency|Naxalbari uprising]]", he had dropped out of the higher studies at the [[Jadavpur University]] in Kolkata, and "picked up a gun and vanished into the forest" about 4 decades ago; and had remained underground since then.&lt;ref name="T–Nitin"/&gt;

==Controversies==
Civil rights activist Babloo Loitongbom, said that "there was an allegation that certain members of the UNLF had raped 20 women. We formed a multi-ethnic fact finding team to go to the place. Unfortunately, we were not allowed to go inside the camp, we were not given any medical evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barandbench.com/content/212/%E2%80%9Cif-you-go-hunting-be-ready-meet-tiger%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-human-rights-activist-and-scholar-babloo|publisher=BarandBench|title="If you go hunting, be ready to meet the tiger" — Human rights activist and scholar, BablooLoitongbam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
Mounted [[Watchman (law enforcement)|watchmen]] of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|United States Department of Commerce and Labor]] patrolled the border in an effort to prevent illegal crossings as early as 1904, but their efforts were irregular and undertaken only when resources permitted. The inspectors, usually called "mounted guards", operated out of [[El Paso, Texas]]. Though they never totaled more than 75, they patrolled as far west as [[California]] trying to restrict the flow of illegal Chinese immigration.

In March 1917, Congress authorized a separate group of mounted guards, often referred to as "mounted inspectors". Most rode on horseback, but a few operated automobiles, motorcycles and boats. Although these inspectors had broader arrest authority, they still largely pursued Chinese immigrants trying to avoid the [[National Origins Act]] and [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882. These patrolmen were Immigration Inspectors, assigned to inspection stations, and could not watch the border at all times. [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] soldiers along the southwest border performed intermittent border patrolling, but this was secondary to "the more serious work of military training." Immigrants encountered illegally in the U.S. by the Army were directed to the immigration inspection stations. [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] were also sporadically assigned to patrol duties by the state, and their efforts were noted as "singularly effective".

The first Border Patrol station began operations in Detroit, Michigan in June 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-patrol-sectors/detroit-sector-selfridge-angb-michigan/detroit-station|title=Detroit Station {{!}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection |website=www.cbp.gov|access-date=September 21, 2016|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215232051/https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-patrol-sectors/detroit-sector-selfridge-angb-michigan/detroit-station|archivedate=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second station in El Paso, Texas began operations in July 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-patrol-sectors/el-paso-sector-texas|title=El Paso Sector Texas {{!}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection|website=www.cbp.gov|access-date=September 21, 2016|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215234918/https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-patrol-sectors/el-paso-sector-texas|archivedate=December 15, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional operations were established along the Gulf Coast in 1927 to perform crewman control to ensure that foreign crewmen departed on the same ship on which they arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_sectors/detroit_sector_mi/detroit_welcome.xml|work=CBP|title=Detroit Welcome|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304075347/http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_sectors/detroit_sector_mi/detroit_welcome.xml|archivedate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, the Border Patrol was divided into two offices. Mexican border operations were directed from [[El Paso, Texas]] and Canadian border operations were directed from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. The Canadian border operations from Detroit employed more men than the El Paso operations along the Mexican border because of a focus on the prevention of liquor smuggling during prohibition. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s Executive Order 6166 formed the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS) in 1933 by consolidation of the Bureau of Immigration and the Bureau of Naturalization. Following the outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe, Border Patrol staffing doubled to 1,500 in 1940, and the INS was moved from the Department of Labor to the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.borderpatrolmuseum.com/history/border-patrol-history.html|title=A History of the United States Border Patrol |publisher=National Border Patrol Museum|accessdate=April 10, 2013|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908070136/http://borderpatrolmuseum.com/history/border-patrol-history.html |archivedate=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional stations were temporarily added along the Gulf Coast, Florida and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]] during the 1960s after Fidel Castro triumphed in the [[Cuban Revolution]] and that was followed by the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. INS was decommissioned in March 2003 when its operations were divided between CBP, [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]], and [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]].

In the wake of the attacks of September 11, the Border Patrol was placed under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security, and preventing terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United States was added to its mission. The Border Patrol's traditional mission continued: deterring, detecting and apprehending illegal immigrants and individuals involved in the illegal drug trade who generally entered the United States at places other than through designated [[ports of entry]]. The Border Patrol also erected{{when|date=June 2014}} 33 permanent [[United States Border Patrol Interior Checkpoints|interior checkpoints]] near the southern border of the United States.

For fiscal year 2017, the nationwide total of Border Patrol agents was 19,437.&lt;ref name=FY2017staffing&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2017-Dec/BP%20Staffing%20FY1992-FY2017.pdf|title=United States Border Patrol Agent Nationwide Staffing by Fiscal Year|website=U.S. Customs and Border Protection|publisher=U.S. Department of Homeland Security|access-date=June 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Southwest border sectors were patrolled by 16,605 agents, while 2,048 other agents staffed northern border sectors and 212 were assigned to coastal border sectors.&lt;ref name=FY2017staffing/&gt; Agents primarily patrol the [[Mexico–United States border]], where they control drug trafficking and illegal immigration.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who we are and what we do |date=September 3, 2008|publisher=U.S. Customs and Border Protection |url=http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/who_we_are.xml|accessdate=June 1, 2009 |work=CPB.gov|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510084324/http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/who_we_are.xml|archivedate=May 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==

===1986: Employer sanctions and interior enforcement===
[[File:United States Border Patrol Mexico.jpg|thumb|right|Border Patrol Agents with a [[Hummer]] and [[Eurocopter AS350 Écureuil|Astar]] patrol for illegal entry into the United States]]
The Border Patrol's priorities have changed over the years. In 1986, the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act]] placed renewed emphasis on controlling illegal immigration by going after the employers that hire illegal aliens. The belief was that jobs were the magnet that attracted most illegal aliens to come to the United States. The Border Patrol increased interior enforcement and Form I-9 audits of businesses through an inspection program known as "employer sanctions". Several agents were assigned to interior stations, such as within the [[Livermore Sector (U.S. Border Patrol)|Livermore Sector]] in Northern California.

Employer sanctions never became the effective tool it was expected to be by Congress. Illegal immigration continued to swell after the 1986 amnesty despite employer sanctions. By 1993, Californians passed [[Proposition 187]], denying benefits to illegal aliens and criminalizing illegal aliens in possession of forged green cards, identification cards, and Social Security numbers. It also authorized police officers to question non-nationals as to their immigration status and required police and sheriff departments to cooperate and report illegal aliens to the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]]. Proposition 187 drew nationwide attention to illegal immigration.

====Checkpoint stations====
[[United States Border Patrol Interior Checkpoints]] are inspection stations operated by the USBP within {{convert|100|mi}} of an international border (with Mexico or Canada) or any U.S. coastline, or in the [[Florida Keys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tina|last=Starr|title=Local man's film highlights plight of migrant farm workers|url=https://www.vermontfolklifecenter.org/exhibits-feed/the-golden-cage |location=Barton, Vermont|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====El Paso Sector's Operation Hold the Line====
[[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] Sector Chief Patrol Agent [[Silvestre Reyes]] started a program called "Operation Hold the Line". In this program, Border Patrol agents would no longer react to [[illegal entry|illegal entries]] resulting in apprehensions, but would instead be forward deployed to the border, immediately detecting any attempted entries or deterring crossing at a more remote location. The idea was that it would be easier to capture illegal entrants in the wide open deserts than through the urban alleyways. Chief Reyes deployed his agents along the [[Rio Grande]], within eyesight of other agents. The program significantly reduced illegal entries in the urban part of El Paso, however, the operation merely shifted the illegal entries to other areas.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

====San Diego Sector's Operation Gatekeeper====
[[File:Border patrol at the beach, San Diego county.jpg|thumb|right|Patrolling the beach in San Diego County, California]]
San Diego Sector tried [[Silvestre Reyes]]' approach of forward deploying agents to deter illegal entries into the country. Congress authorized the hiring of thousands of new agents, and many were sent to San Diego Sector.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In addition, Congressman [[Duncan Hunter]] became a major proponent of border fencing; surplus [[Marston Mat|military landing mats]] were obtained to use as an initial border fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=With Congress's Blessing, a Border Fence May Finally Push Through to the Sea|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/04/us/with-congresss-blessing-a-border-fence-may-finally-push-through-to-the-sea.html |newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 4, 2005|access-date=December 8, 2015|issn=0362-4331|first=John M.|last=Broder|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028081350/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/04/us/with-congresss-blessing-a-border-fence-may-finally-push-through-to-the-sea.html|archivedate=October 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stadium lighting, ground sensors and infra-red cameras were also placed in the area.

Retrieved on July 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Northern border staffing had been increased by 1,128 agents to 1,470 agents by the end of fiscal year 2008, and is projected to expand to 1,845 by the end of fiscal year 2009, a sixfold increase. Resources that support Border Patrol agents include the use of new technology and a more focused application of air and marine assets.

The northern border sectors are (west to east): Blaine (Washington), Spokane (Washington), Havre (Montana), Grand Forks (North Dakota), Detroit (Selfridge ANGB, Michigan), Buffalo (New York), Swanton (Vermont), and Houlton (Maine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-patrol-sectors|title=Border Patrol Sectors {{!}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection|website=www.cbp.gov|access-date=September 21, 2016|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830194302/https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-patrol-sectors |archivedate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The new strategy===
[[File:US Mexico border surveillance.jpg|right|thumb|Cameras add "Smart Border" surveillance.]]

In November 2005, the U.S. Border Patrol published an updated national strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/national_bp_strategy.ctt/national_bp_strategy.pdf|title=National Border Patrol Strategy|accessdate=November 28, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051112235923/http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/national_bp_strategy.ctt/national_bp_strategy.pdf|archivedate=November 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this updated strategy is operational control of the United States border.  The strategy has five main objectives:
#Apprehend terrorists and terrorist weapons illegally entering the United States;
#Deter illegal entries through improved enforcement;
#Detect, apprehend, and deter smugglers of humans, drugs, and other contraband;
#Use "smart border" technology; and
#Reduce crime in border communities, improving quality of life.

[[File:Border Patrol ATV IMG 5278.jpg|thumb|right|Border Patrol all-terrain vehicles]]
The United States border is a barely discernible line in uninhabited deserts, canyons, or mountains. The Border Patrol utilizes a variety of equipment and methods, such as electronic sensors placed at strategic locations along the border, to detect people or vehicles entering the country illegally. Video monitors and night vision scopes are also used to detect illegal entries. Agents patrol the border in vehicles, boats, aircraft, and afoot. In some areas, the Border Patrol employs horses, all-terrain motorcycles, bicycles, and snowmobiles. Air surveillance capabilities are provided by [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web

The primary activity of a Border Patrol Agent is "Line Watch". Line Watch involves the detection, prevention, and apprehension of terrorists, illegal aliens and smugglers of aliens at or near the land border by maintaining surveillance from a covert position; following up on leads; responding to electronic sensor, television systems and aircraft sightings; and interpreting and following tracks, marks, and other physical evidence. Major activities include traffic check, traffic observation, city patrol, transportation check, administrative, intelligence, and anti-smuggling activities.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;

Traffic checks are conducted on major highways leading away from the border to detect and apprehend illegal aliens attempting to travel further into the interior of the United States after evading detection at the border, and to detect illegal narcotics.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;

Transportation checks are inspections of interior-bound conveyances, which include buses, commercial aircraft, passenger and freight trains, and marine craft.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;

Marine Patrols are conducted along the coastal waterways of the United States, primarily along the Pacific coast, the Caribbean, the tip of Florida, and Puerto Rico and interior waterways common to the United States and Canada. Border Patrol conducts border control activities from 130 marine craft of various sizes. The Border Patrol maintains watercraft ranging from blue-water craft to inflatable-hull craft, in 16 sectors, in addition to headquarters special operations components.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;

Horse and bike patrols are used to augment regular vehicle and foot patrols. Horse units patrol remote areas along the international boundary that are inaccessible to standard all-terrain vehicles. Bike patrol aids city patrol and is used over rough terrain to support linewatch.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt; Snowmobiles are used to patrol remote areas along the northern border in the winter.

In 1992, the United States Border Patrol had approximately 4,139 Patrol Agents on the job.  Attrition in the Border Patrol was normally at 5%.  From 1995–2001 annual attrition rose to above 10%, which was a period when the Border Patrol was undergoing massive hiring.  In 2002 the attrition rate climbed to 18%.  The 18% attrition was largely attributed to agents transferring to the [[Federal Air Marshals]] after [[9/11]]. Since that time the attrition rate has decreased. Congress increased journeyman Border Patrol Agent pay from a [[General Schedule (US civil service pay scale)|GS-9 rate to a GS-11 rate]] in 2002.   The Border Patrol Marine Position was created in 2009 (BPA-M).  This position will be updated to a GS-12 position sometime in 2010 or 2011.  Border Patrol Field Training Officers may possibly be updated in 2010 to a temporary GS-12 pay rate.  In 2005, Border Patrol attrition dropped to 4% and remains in the area of 4% to 6% as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nuñez-Neto|first=Blas|title=Border security: The role of the U.S. Border Patrol|publisher=Congressional Research Service|date=January 25, 2006|format=PDF |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs//data/2006/upl-meta-crs-8464/RL32562_2006Jan25.pdf|page=35|accessdate=June 1, 2009 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030025902/http://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs//data/2006/upl-meta-crs-8464/RL32562_2006Jan25.pdf|archivedate=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act]] of 2004 (signed by President Bush on December 17, 2004) authorized hiring an additional 10,000 agents, "subject to appropriation".

The [[Secure Fence Act of 2006|Secure Fence Act]], signed by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2006, has met with much opposition. In October 2007, environmental groups and concerned citizens filed a restraining order hoping to halt the construction of the fence, set to be built between the United States and Mexico. The act mandates that the fence be built by December 2008. Ultimately, the United States seeks to put fencing around the {{convert|1945|mi|km|adj=on}} border, but the act requires only {{convert|700|mi|km}} of fencing. DHS secretary Michael Chertoff has bypassed environmental and other oppositions with a waiver that was granted to him by Congress in Section 102 of the act, which allows DHS to avoid any conflicts that would prevent a speedy assembly of the fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Coyle|first=Marcia|title=Waivers for border fence challenged: Environmental groups take their complaints to Supreme Court|newspaper=The Recorder|date=March 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/02/us/02fence.html|title=Government issues waiver for fencing along border|author=Archibold, Randal C.|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 2, 2008|accessdate=April 2, 2008|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927063615/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/02/us/02fence.html|archivedate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This action has led many environment groups and landowners to speak out against the impending construction of the fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Conservation groups call for an immediate halt to construction of border fence in San Pedro National Conservation Area |newspaper=US Newswire|date=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environment and wildlife groups fear that the plans to clear brush, construct fences, install bright lights, motion sensors, and cameras will scare wildlife and endanger the indigenous species of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Gordon, David George|title=A 'grande' dispute|magazine=National Geographic World|date=May 2000|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmentalists claim that the ecosystem could be affected because a border fence would restrict movement of all animal species, which in turn would keep them from water and food sources on one side or another. Desert plants would also feel the impact, as they would be uprooted in many areas where the fence is set to occupy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Cohn, Jeffrey P.|title=The environmental impacts of a border fence|journal=BioScience|year=2007|volume=57|issue=1|page=96|doi=10.1641/B570116 |url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.1641/B570116|accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Property owners in these areas fear a loss of land. Landowners would have to give some of their land over to the government for the fence. Citizens also fear that communities will be split. Many students travel over the border every day to attend classes at the University of Texas at Brownsville. Brownsville mayor Pat Ahumada favors alternative options to a border fence. He suggests that the Rio Grande be widened and deepened to provide for a natural barrier to hinder illegal aliens and drug smugglers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

"Operation Gatekeeper" was launched in 1994 to stop migrants from crossing illegally into the United States.  The strategy included increased enforcement and extensive fencing near border cities, with the twofold purpose of deflecting migrants to remote areas where they could more easily be detected and apprehended, as well as using the formidable mountains, deserts, and [[Rio Grande]] as a deterrent to easy passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://citation.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/3/7/1/5/pages237154/p237154-11.php|title=Prevention-Through-Deterrence and Death Mitigation: Fantasy and Fetishes in Border Law's Symbolic Order|last=Fan|first=Mary D.|publisher=All Academic |accessdate=September 21, 2016|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060010/http://citation.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/3/7/1/5/pages237154/p237154-11.php|archivedate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The newly erected [[Mexico–United States barrier]]—which at some remote locations is no more than a fence—has also forced migrants and human traffickers to seek out remote desert locations in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas where they may attempt crossing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Border Patrol Southwest Border Fence Maps |publisher=U.S. Customs and Border Protection|date=February 13, 2013 |url=http://nemo.cbp.gov/borderpatrol/2435_southwest.pdf |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923085638/http://nemo.cbp.gov/borderpatrol/2435_southwest.pdf |archivedate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolb|first=Joseph J.|title=Fort Hancock, Texas: Where a fence and hope for illegals ends |publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|date=July 1, 2013|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/07/01/fort-hancock-texas-where-fence-and-hope-for-illegals-ends/|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922222449/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/07/01/fort-hancock-texas-where-fence-and-hope-for-illegals-ends/|archivedate=September 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "funnel effect" created by both these strategies has contributed to the [[Migrant deaths along the Mexico–United States border|deaths]] of thousands of migrants, whose remains are often found in the hot desert or freezing mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Continued Humanitarian Crisis at the Border: Undocumented Border Crosser Deaths Recorded by the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner, 1990–2012|publisher=University of Arizona|year=2013 |url=http://bmi.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/border_deaths_final_web.pdf|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920111514/http://bmi.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/border_deaths_final_web.pdf |archivedate=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1998, the former [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] implemented the Border Safety Initiative in response to concerns about the number of migrants injured or killed while attempting to cross the border. It was noted that Border Patrol agents routinely supplied water, food, and medical care to migrants.&lt;ref name="GAO"&gt;{{cite web |title=Border-Crossing Deaths Have Doubled Since 1995; Border Patrol’s Efforts to Prevent Deaths Have Not Been Fully Evaluated|publisher=U.S. Government Accountability Office |date=August 2006|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/260/251173.pdf|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930091636/http://www.gao.gov/assets/260/251173.pdf |archivedate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Border Patrol, Search, Trauma and Rescue]] (BORSTAR), a specialized unit trained in emergency search and rescue, was established with the purpose of assisting injured or stranded migrants at remote locations.&lt;ref name="BP-A"&gt;{{cite web|title=Border Patrol Search, Trauma, and Rescue (BORSTAR) |publisher=U.S. Customs and Border Protection |date=May 2009 |url=http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/newsroom/fact_sheets/border/border_patrol/borstar.ctt/borstar.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926195059/http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/newsroom/fact_sheets/border/border_patrol/borstar.ctt/borstar.pdf |archivedate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We know that beacons work: CBP has already saved dozens of people based entirely on beacon alerts."&lt;ref name="Polliard"/&gt; The Border Patrol frequently publishes reports about stranded and injured individuals rescued at beacon locations.

During a 12-month period in 2011–12, Border Patrol agents made 1,312 rescues along the Mexico-United States border, nearly half occurring in the Tucson Sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Border Patrol Sector Profile – Fiscal Year 2012|publisher=U.S. Customs and Border Protection|date=February 4, 2013 |url=http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/usbp_statistics/usbp_fy12_stats/usbp_sector_profile.ctt/usbp_sector_profile.pdf|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130303081836/http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/usbp_statistics/usbp_fy12_stats/usbp_sector_profile.ctt/usbp_sector_profile.pdf |archivedate=March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Border Patrol Sectors==

[[File:Border Patrol in Montana.jpg|thumb|right|Border Patrol in Montana.]]
There are 20 Border Patrol sectors, each headed by a Sector Chief Patrol Agent.

==Training==
All Border Patrol agents spend a minimum of 13 weeks at the Border Patrol Academy (if they are fluent in Spanish) in [[Artesia, New Mexico]], which is a component of the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]] (FLETC).  Those who are not fluent in Spanish spend an additional eight weeks at the Academy for a total of 21 weeks. Border Patrol Agent Trainees are instructed in courses including; criminal law, nationality law, and administrative immigration law, police sciences, self-defense and arrest techniques, firearms training with pistol, shotgun and rifle, police vehicle driving, and other Border Patrol / federal law enforcement subjects.

Once they arrive back at their duty station, Trainees then must graduate from the Field Training Officer (FTO) program, an on-the-job training program, which varies in length from a minimum of 12 weeks to a maximum of over 16 weeks long, depending on the practical demands of the duty station and local management.  They must also successfully complete the Post Academy Training Program, an extension of the Border Patrol Academy where Trainees complete additional classroom-based training over the course of their first nine months back at their duty station.

The marksmanship skills of Border Patrol agents ranks among the best in the United States.  At the National Police Shooting Championships in 2012, Border Patrol agents placed first, second or third in each of the 29 shooting matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://npsc.nra.org/past-results.aspx|title=Past National Police Shooting Championships Results |publisher=National Rifle Association of America|access-date=|accessdate=September 21, 2016|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126064759/http://npsc.nra.org/past-results.aspx|archivedate=November 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
[[File:CBP female officers going aboard a ship.jpg|thumb|right|Officers boarding a ship that's entered US waters]]
===Uniforms===
The Border Patrol, c. 2007, wore the following types of uniforms:
[[File:CBP Officers pay tribute 2007.jpg|thumb|right|A color guard composed of CBP officers and USBP agents at a Washington, D.C. ceremony in May 2007.]]
*Summer Dress uniform – The summer dress uniform consists of a short-sleeve, olive-green dress shirt (which may or may not have blue shoulder straps), brass [[nameplate]], badge, olive-green [[slacks]] with a blue stripe running the length of the seam, and black dress shoes or dress boots. A green, straw [[campaign hat]] is worn with this uniform.
* Winter Dress uniform – The winter dress uniform consists of a long-sleeve, olive green dress shirt, navy-blue [[clip-on tie]] with a brass [[tie tack]], olive-green [[ike jacket]] with blue accents (shoulder straps and cuffs), brass nameplate, badge, olive-green slacks with a blue stripe running the length of the seam, and black dress shoes or dress boots. a green, felt campaign hat with a black, leather [[hat band]] is worn with this uniform.
*Ceremonial Dress uniform – Worn primarily by border patrol [[Guard of honour|honor guard]] agents, the ceremonial dress uniform is roughly identical to the winter dress uniform, with the exception that a [[tunic]] is worn with this uniform, rather than an ike jacket. White, cloth gloves are also worn with this uniform. 
* Rough duty uniform – The rough duty uniform consists of a green, long-sleeve or short-sleeve work shirt, green [[cargo pants]], and black work boots. a green [[baseball cap]] is typically worn with this uniform.
**There are also specialized rough duty uniforms for marine patrol (riverine), northern border cold weather, horse patrol and bike patrol agents.
* Highland Uniform – Worn by members of the United States Border Patrol Pipes and Drums in the performance of their official duties, this uniform includes a kilt made of the official Border Patrol Tartan, custom made ceremonial coat, glengarry, sporran and spats.
* Organization patches – The Border Patrol wears two:
** The CBP patch is worn on the right sleeves of the uniform. It contains the DHS seal against a black background with a "keystone" shape. A "keystone" is the central, wedge-shaped stone in an arch, which holds all the other stones in place.
** Border Patrol agents retain the circular legacy Border Patrol patch, which is worn on the left sleeve.

The Border Patrol uniform is getting its first makeover since the 1950s to appear more like military fatigues and less like a police officer's duty garb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2007/08/17/news/sandiego/18_64_318_16_07.txt|title=Border Patrol uniform gets first makeover since the 1950s|author=Spagat, Elliot|date=August 16, 2007|newspaper=North County Times|accessdate=June 1, 2009|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626063521/http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2007/08/17/news/sandiego/18_64_318_16_07.txt|archivedate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leather belts with brass buckles are being replaced by nylon belts with quick-release plastic buckles, slacks are being replaced by lightweight cargo pants, and shiny badges and nameplates are being replaced by cloth patches.

===Newton-Azrak Award for Heroism===
The Border Patrol's highest honor is the Newton-Azrak Award for Heroism.  This Award is bestowed to Border Patrol Agents for extraordinary actions, service; accomplishments reflecting unusual courage or bravery in the line of duty; or an extraordinarily heroic or humane act committed during times of extreme stress or in an emergency.

===Weapons===
[[File:CBP M14.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A Border Patrol Honor Guard Agent carrying an [[M14 rifle]].]]
Border Patrol agents are issued the [[H&amp;K P2000]] double action LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) pistol in [[.40 S&amp;W]] caliber. It can contain as many as 13 rounds of ammunition (12 in the magazine and one in the chamber). Up until 1994 the Border Patrol issued its Patrol Agents a .357 Magnum revolver as their duty sidearm, a [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] or [[Ruger]] model large frame, six shot revolver.  The Border Patrol preferred this weapon because it did not jam in harsh conditions, like those of the southwestern border, and also because of the strong "stopping" power of the .357 Magnum cartridge. Although up until 1994 Patrol Agents could purchase a weapon from the agency list of approved authorized personal weapons for duty carry. This list included the Glock Models 17 and 19 pistols in 9mm, the [[SIG Sauer P220]] pistol in .45 ACP caliber, the [[Colt Python]] .357 Magnum revolver, and the [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 19|Smith &amp; Wesson Model 19/66]] .357 Magnum revolver. The Border Patrol adopted the [[Beretta 92|Beretta Model 96D]], a .40 S&amp;W caliber semi-automatic pistol (modified for Double-Action Only) (with 11-round capacity magazines) as its duty issue sidearm in 1995.  The .40 S&amp;W caliber jacketed hollow-point cartridge was adopted because of its excellent "stopping" power and its superior ballistic characteristics over the 9mm cartridge. In late 2006 the H&amp;K P2000 pistol was adopted as the Border Patrol's primary duty sidearm.  The H&amp;K Model USP Compact pistol, H&amp;K Model P2000SK (sub-compact) and Beretta M96D .40 S&amp;W caliber pistols are authorized as secondary sidearms.

Like many other law enforcement agencies, the 12 [[gauge (bore diameter)|gauge]] [[Remington Model 870]] is the standard pump-action shotgun. The Border Patrol issue Model 870 has been modified by Scattergun Technologies to Border Patrol specifications including: a 14-inch barrel, a five-shot capacity magazine, a composite stock with pistol grip, and night sights with a tactical "ghost-ring" rear sight. The old Border Patrol "anti-bandit" units used to use a 12-gauge, semi-automatic shotgun with a sawed-off barrel. This weapon had the designated name of a "Sidewinder."  The USBP anti-bandit units were decommissioned in the late 1980s.

Border Patrol agents also commonly carry the [[.223 Remington|.223]] caliber Colt [[M4 Carbine|M4 Carbine (M4A1)]] and the [[H&amp;K UMP]] .40 caliber [[submachine gun]]. The [[.308 Winchester|.308]] caliber [[M14 rifle]] is used for ceremonial purposes and by agents who are qualified with the rifle and [[BORTAC]].

As less than lethal options, the Border Patrol uses the FN 303 Launcher.  The FN 303 fires plastic pellet balls containing OC (Oleoresin Capsicum) Pepper dust.  The plastic pellet balls burst on impact spraying the suspect with OC Pepper dust and also act as an impact projectile. The Border Patrol also issues its agents OC Pepper spray canisters, tasers and a collapsible/telescopic (or telescoping) steel police baton.

[[File:South Texas, Border Patrol Agents, McAllen Horse Patrol Unit.jpg|thumb|right|A USBP Horse Patrol in southern Texas.]]
Unlike in many other law enforcement agencies in the United States, the Border Patrol operates over 10,000 [[SUV]]s and pickup trucks, which are known for their capabilities to move around in any sort of terrain. These vehicles may have individual revolving lights (strobes or LEDs) and/or light bars and sirens and/or have their bumpers removed or have off-road suspension and tires. An extensive modernization drive has ensured that these vehicles are equipped with wireless sets in communication with a central control room. Border Patrol vehicles may also have equipment such as emergency first aid kits. Some sectors make use of sedans like the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]] or the [[Dodge Charger (LX)#Police package version|Dodge Charger]] as patrol cars or high speed "interceptors" on highways. The border patrol has approx 2,000 sedans. The Border Patrol also operates all-terrain vehicles, motorcycles, snowmobiles, and small boats in riverine environments.

In 2005, all Border Patrol and ICE aircraft operations were combined under CBP's [[Office of Air and Marine]].  All CBP vessel operations within the Customs Waters and on the high seas are conducted by Marine Interdiction Agents of the Office of Air and Marine.

Color schemes of Border Patrol vehicles are either a long green stripe running the length of the vehicle (older vehicles) or a broad green diagonal stripe (newer vehicles) on the door. Most Border Patrol vehicles are painted predominantly white. During the 1960s to mid-1980s Border Patrol vehicles were painted a light green.

The Border Patrol also extensively uses horses for remote area patrols. {{As of|2005}}, the [[U.S. Border Patrol]] has 205 horses. Most are employed along the [[Mexico–United States border]]. In [[Arizona]], these animals are fed special processed feed pellets so that their wastes do not spread non-native plants in the national parks and wildlife areas they patrol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Armed incursions==
On August 7, 2008, [[Mexican Army|Mexican troops]] crossed the border into Arizona and held a U.S. Border Patrol Agent at gunpoint. Agents stationed at [[Ajo, Arizona]] said that the Mexican soldiers crossed the border into an isolated area southwest of Tucson and pointed rifles at the agent, who has not been identified. The Mexicans withdrew after other U.S. agents arrived on the scene.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

On March 14, 2000, 16 Mexican soldiers in two humvees chased a Border Patrol agent near Santa Teresa, New Mexico, while another agent came under gunfire. Backup arrived and the soldiers were detained. The Mexican government said the soldiers got lost. The U.S. State Department ordered them sent back to Mexico along with their weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsmax.com/insidecover/mexican_troops_border/2008/08/06/119516.html|title=Mexican troops cross border, hold border agent |author=Meyers, Jim|publisher=Newsmax.com|date=August 6, 2008|accessdate=June 1, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822095841/http://www.newsmax.com/insidecover/mexican_troops_border/2008/08/06/119516.html|archivedate=August 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ramos and Compean===
In February 2005, Border Patrol Agents [[Ignacio Ramos]] and [[Jose Compean]] were involved in an incident while pursuing a van in [[Fabens, Texas]]. The driver, later identified as Aldrete Davila, was shot by Agent Ramos during a scuffle. Davila escaped back into Mexico, and the agents discovered that the van contained a million dollars worth of marijuana (about 750 pounds). None of the agents at the scene orally reported the shooting, including two supervisors: Robert Arnold, first-line Supervisor and Jonathan Richards, a higher ranking Field Operations Supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2006/08/28/Uproar-over-US-Border-Patrol-shooting/UPI-58451156792824/|title=Uproar over U.S. Border Patrol shooting|publisher=UPI|date=August 28, 2006|accessdate=March 8, 2012 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210004405/http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2006/08/28/Uproar-over-US-Border-Patrol-shooting/UPI-58451156792824/|archivedate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/219384/Ramos-and-Campean-Court-Appeal|title=Ramos and Campean – court appeal|accessdate=June 1, 2009|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724041451/http://www.scribd.com/doc/219384/Ramos-and-Campean-Court-Appeal|archivedate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of abuse===

Various civil society and human rights organizations have alleged that abuses of migrants by Border Patrol agents occur frequently:

*Between 2010 and 2011 alleged excessive use of force by Border Patrol and Field Operations agents led to the death of six Mexican citizens. A PBS report, ''Crossing the Line'', released in July 2012, profiled the case of Hernández-Rojas who died after being beaten and while in custody of the USBP, ICE, and CBP in May 2010.&lt;ref name="Meyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DOJ_2015" /&gt; In 2012, in a letter to President Obama posted on the website of the Washington Office on Latin America, 118 civil society organizations criticized the Border Patrol for failing to thoroughly investigate the incident and stated that the Border Patrol "is operating with very little transparency and virtual impunity, especially in the southern border region where Border Patrol and other CBP agents regularly violate the human and civil rights of those who call the border region home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Organizations Urge President Obama to Address Border Patrol Abuses |url=http://www.wola.org/news/us_organizations_send_letter_to_president_obama_on_customs_and_border_protection_abuses|publisher=Washington Office on Latin America|accessdate=August 23, 2012|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108064131/http://www.wola.org/news/us_organizations_send_letter_to_president_obama_on_customs_and_border_protection_abuses|archivedate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*From 2008–2011, the Arizona organization [[No More Deaths]] interviewed nearly 13,000 migrants who had been in Border Patrol custody, in the Arizona border towns of Naco, Nogales, and Agua Prieta. Their report, ''A Culture of Cruelty'', documents alleged abuses including denial of or insufficient water and food; failure to provide medical treatment; verbal, physical and psychological abuse; separation of family members and dangerous repatriation practices. In February 2012, Border Patrol Chief Michael Fisher stated in congressional testimony that the Border Patrol takes allegations of abuse seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Michael |title=Testimony of Chief Michael Fisher |url=http://www.micevhill.com/attachments/immigration_documents/hosted_documents/112th_congress/TranscriptOfHouseAppropriationsSubcommitteeHearingOnFY13CBPBudgetRequest.pdf|work=Transcript of House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland  Security Hearing on the Proposed Fiscal 2013 Appropriations  for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection|publisher=House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland  Security|accessdate=August 23, 2012|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412145047/http://www.micevhill.com/attachments/immigration_documents/hosted_documents/112th_congress/TranscriptOfHouseAppropriationsSubcommitteeHearingOnFY13CBPBudgetRequest.pdf|archivedate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, No More Deaths testified before the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights in March 2012 and stated that in spite of raising their concerns for several years, "the agency has taken the position that such abuses simply do not occur."&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt;
*There are allegations of abuse by the United States Border Patrol such as the ones reported by Jesus A. Trevino, that concludes in an article published in the ''Houston Journal of International Law'' (2006) with a request to create an independent review commission to oversee the actions of the Border Patrol, and that creating such review board will make the American public aware of the "serious problem of abuse that exists at the border by making this review process public" and that "illegal immigrants deserve the same constitutionally-mandated humane treatment of citizens and legal residents".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

*In 1998, [[Amnesty International]] investigated allegations of ill-treatment and brutality by officers of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]], and particularly the Border Patrol. Their report said they found indications of [[human rights]] violations during 1996, 1997 and early 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|date=May 19, 1998 |url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engAMR510031998|title=United States of America: Human rights concerns in the border region with Mexico|accessdate=June 1, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021020708/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engAMR510031998 |archivedate=October 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An article in ''Social Justice'' by Michael Huspek, Leticia Jimenez, Roberto Martinez (1998) cites that in December 1997, John Case, head of the INS Office of Internal Audit, announced at a press conference that public complaints to the INS had risen 29% from 1996, with the "vast majority" of complaints emanating from the southwest border region, but that of the 2,300 cases, the 243 cases of serious allegations of abuse were down in 1997. These serious cases are considered to be distinct from less serious complaints, such as "verbal abuse, discrimination, extended detention without cause."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huspek|first=Michael|author2=Roberto Martinez|author3=Leticia Jimenez|title=Violations of human and civil rights on the U.S.-Mexico border, 1995 to 1997: a report |journal=Social Justice|format=Reprint|volume=25|issue=2|year=1998|issn=1043-1578 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3427/is_n2_v25/ai_n28711340/|accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;p&gt;The data compiled in this report suggest that law enforcement in the southwest region of the United States may be verging on lawlessness. This statement receives fuller support from announcements emanating from the INS. In December 1997, John Chase, head of the INS Office of Internal Audit, announced at a press conference that public complaints to the INS had risen 29% from 1996, with the "vast majority" of complaints emanating from the southwest border region. Over 2,300 complaints were filed in 1997 as opposed to the 1,813 complaints filed in 1996. Another 400 reports of "minor misconduct" were placed in a new category. Chase was quick to emphasize, however, that the 243 "serious" allegations of abuse and use of excessive force that could warrant criminal prosecution were down in 1997, as compared with the 328 in 1996. These "serious" cases are considered to be distinct from less serious complaints, such as "verbal abuse, discrimination, extended detention without cause.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1830">'''Village Design Statement''' (VDS) is a term of English rural planning practice. A VDS is a document that describes the distinctive characteristics of the locality, and provides design guidance to influence future development and improve the physical qualities of the area. Due to the rural bias of many communities and the large urban majority in the UK its often considered in the context of [[urban planning]] although it was developed for the rural setting. 

Drawing up the VDS provides an opportunity for communities to describe how they feel the physical character of their [[parish]] can be enhanced.

[[Rural Community Council]]s support local communities in the production of Village Design Statements.

Originally the VDSs focused on only the built environment, but due to development in the surveying methods they began to include elements of service provision and have largely been superseded by Village Action Plans.
