The '''1960 Writers Guild of America strike''' was the second longest writers strike in the history of the Writers Guild.  It lasted {{Age in weeks and days |day1=16 |month1=1 |year1=1960 |day2=10 |month2=6 |year2=1960}}, just one week less than the [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|1988 writers strike]].  The strike against the producers lasted from January 16, 1960, until June 10, 1960 (agreement reached June 10, but not signed until June 12).  The strike against the networks began on March 19.  Negotiations were between the [[Writers Guild of America, west]], the [[Writers Guild of America, East]], and the [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers|Association of Motion Picture Producers]].

For a time, the actors were on strike at the same time, but they had returned to work before the writers reached a compromise with the movie companies.

The conflict was about writer's right to receive a share of revenue of the studios from the lease or sale of movies to television.

Seven of the eight major studios struck a deal: [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]], [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth-Century Fox]], [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney]], and [[Warner Bros.]]  The eighth, [[Universal Studios|Universal International]], had reached an agreement before the strike broke out.  The settlement included having the studios pay into the writers' pension and health funds in the amount of $600,000.  They also agreed to give 5% of the studio's income from movies pre-1960 which were on television.  On post-1960 movies, writers got 2% of income.  If the film was shown on pay-TV, they would not receive additional income.  The minimum rates were also increased to $350 a week and writers would get a 10% raise for the first two years and then 5% for the next year and a half.

For television writers, minimum wages increased 100 percent for the first two years and 100 for the next two.  Writers for low-budget half hour shows would get $935 instead of $850.  High budget writers would get $1,200 instead of $1,100.  Writers would get a 4% royalty domestically and internationally on all reruns "in perpetuity".  In the past, writers were paid on only the first five domestic reruns (they got 140% of their minimum pay scale for that).  They also agreed to create a health and welfare fund.

The '''opening ceremony for the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]]''' was held at [[Celtic Park]] in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, between 21:00 and 23:40 BST, on 23 July 2014.

==Parade of Nations==
The ceremony was directed by [[David Zolkwer]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/24/commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-glasgow-review |title=Commonwealth Games opening ceremony review – no lack of heart but a lack of oomph |last=Gardner |first=Lyn|authorlink=Lyn Gardner|date=24 July 2014|website=[[theguardian.com]]|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included the [[2014 Commonwealth Games Parade of Nations]] where 71 athletes, bearing the flags of their respective nations and territories, led their national delegations as they paraded into the stadium. The games were formally opened by [[Her Majesty (style)|Her Majesty]] [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. She referred to the Commonwealth's "shared ideals and ambitions" and the "bonds that unite" its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duncanson|first=Hilary|date= 23 July 2014|title=Queen tells of 'shared ideals' at Commonwealth Games opening ceremony|url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/queen-tells-of-shared-ideals-at-commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-30455671.html|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|agency=[[Press Association]]|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programme==

The programme, which included about 2,000 performers, featured [[Karen Dunbar]], [[John Barrowman]], [[Amy Macdonald]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Susan Boyle]], [[Nicola Benedetti]], [[Julie Fowlis]], [[Pumeza Matshikiza]], [[Eric Whitacre]] and the [[National Youth Choir of Scotland]], as well as a message from the [[International Space Station]]. The ceremony began with a countdown and a recorded video message from Scottish actor [[Ewan McGregor]], explaining the partnership between the Games and [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/commonwealth-games/commonwealth-games-2014-opening-ceremony-ewan-mcgregor-launches-unicef-charity-fundraiser-during-performance-9624536.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the arrival of the Queen there was a [[flypast]] by the [[Red Arrows]] display team. The venue featured the largest LED video screen in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Withnall |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/commonwealth-games/commonwealth-games-2014--on-your-marks-glasgow-ready-for-opening-ceremony-as-scotland-promises-to-show-what-were-made-of-9623129.html |title=Commonwealth Games 2014 – on your marks: Glasgow ready for opening ceremony as Scotland promises to show ‘what we’re made of’ – Commonwealth Games – Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=19 March 2014|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; supplied by Sports Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow2014.com/media-centre/press-releases/sports-technology-showcase-all-bigscreen-action-glasgow-2014 |title=Sports Technology to showcase all the big-screen action of Glasgow 2014 &amp;#124; Glasgow 2014 – Commonwealth Games |publisher=Glasgow 2014 |date= |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland's then First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] welcomed the participants and spectators, and introduced a moment of silence in memory of the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] disaster.

The final part of the [[Queen's Baton Relay]] was run by 32 Scottish volunteers nominated for giving their time to developing the nation's youth through sport. The baton was then passed to [[Chris Hoy|Sir Chris Hoy]], who delivered  it to President of the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] HRH [[Tunku Muda Serting Imran|Prince Imran]] and the Queen. The display of the message concealed within the baton was delayed by a difficulty in opening the device.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

The Games were launched in partnership with UNICEF, to save and change children’s lives. The unique partnership aimed "to use the power of sport to reach every child in Scotland and benefit children in every Commonwealth nation and territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow2014.com/about-us/our-sponsors/unicef |title=Unicef &amp;#124; Glasgow 2014 – Commonwealth Games |publisher=Glasgow 2014 |date= |accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mad30.jpg|thumb|Neuman on ''Mad'' 30]]

'''Alfred E. Neuman ''' is the fictitious [[mascot]] and cover boy of the American humor magazine ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]''. The character's face had drifted through U.S. [[Iconography#iconography and popular culture|iconography]] for decades (it appeared in the early 1930s on a presidential campaign postcard with the caption, "Sure I'm for Roosevelt") before being claimed by ''Mad'' editor [[Harvey Kurtzman]] in 1954 and later named by the magazine's second editor [[Al Feldstein]] in 1956. Since his debut in ''Mad'', Neuman's likeness has appeared on the cover of all but a handful of the magazine's 550+ issues, distinguished by [[Protruding ear|jug ears]], a missing front tooth, and one eye lower than the other. His face is rarely seen in profile; he has virtually always been shown in front view, directly from behind, or in silhouette. 

==History==
[[Harvey Kurtzman]] first spotted the image on a postcard pinned to the office bulletin board of [[Ballantine Books]] editor [[Bernard Shir-Cliff]]. "It was a face that didn't have a care in the world, except mischief", recalled Kurtzman. Shir-Cliff was later a contributor to various magazines created by Kurtzman.&lt;ref&gt;Shir-Cliff, Bernard. "The Karate Lesson". ''Help!'', October 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1954, Neuman made his ''Mad'' debut on the front cover of Ballantine's ''The Mad Reader'', a paperback collection of reprints from the first two years of ''Mad''. The character's first appearance in the comic book was on the cover of ''Mad'' #21 (March 1955), in a tiny image as part of a mock advertisement. A rubber mask bearing his likeness with "idiot" written underneath was offered for $1.29.

[[File:MAD Magazine (no. 21, front cover).jpg|thumb|First cover appearance of Neuman, on ''Mad'' #21 (third from viewer's left of the six faces approx. 40% down the viewer's-right side)]]
''Mad'' switched to a magazine format starting with issue #24, and Neuman's face appeared in the top, central position of the illustrated border used on the covers, with his now-familiar signature phrase "What, me worry?" written underneath. Initially, the phrase was rendered "What? Me worry?" These borders were used for five more issues, through ''Mad'' #30 (December 1956).

The character was also shown on page 9 of Mad #24 as "Melvin Coznowski" and on page 65 as "Melvin Sturdley". In later issues he appeared as "Melvin Cowsnofsky" or "Mel Haney". In ''Mad'' #25, the face and name were shown together on separate pages as both Neuman and Mel Haney. The crowded cover shot on ''Mad'' #27 marked Neuman's first color appearance.

When [[Al Feldstein]] took over as ''Mad''{{-'}}s editor in 1956, he seized upon the face:

{{bquote|I decided that I wanted to have this visual logo as the image of ''Mad'', the same way that corporations had the [[Jolly Green Giant]] and the [[Nipper|dog]] barking {{sic}} at the gramophone for [[RCA]]. This kid was the perfect example of what I wanted. So I put an ad in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that said, "National magazine wants portrait artist for special project". In walked this little old guy in his sixties named [[Norman Mingo]], and he said, "What national magazine is this?" I said "Mad," and he said, "Goodbye." I told him to wait, and I dragged out all these examples and postcards of this idiot kid, and I said, "I want a definitive portrait of this kid. I don't want him to look like an idiot—I want him to be loveable and have an intelligence behind his eyes. But I want him to have this devil-may-care attitude, someone who can maintain a sense of humor while the world is collapsing around him." I adapted and used that portrait, and that was the beginning.}}

Mingo's defining portrait was used on the cover of ''Mad'' #30 in late 1956 as a supposed write-in candidate for the Presidency, and fixed his identity and appearance into the version that has been used ever since. In November 2008, Mingo's original cover art featuring this first official portrait of Neuman sold at auction for $203,150. Mingo painted seven more Neuman covers through 1957, and later returned to become the magazine's signature cover artist throughout the 1960s and 1970s.  Mingo produced 97 ''Mad'' covers in total, and also illustrated dozens of additional cover images for ''Mad'''s many reprint Specials and its line of paperbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madcoversite.com/allthumbs2.html|title=Doug Gilford's Mad Cover Site - All Special Thumbs|website=www.madcoversite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madcoversite.com/pbthumbs.html|title=Doug Gilford's Mad Cover Site - Paperback Thumbs|website=www.madcoversite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Mingo's absence, [[Frank Kelly Freas]] rendered Neuman for ''Mad'' from 1958 to 1962.  Mingo's total surpassed Freas' in 1965, and his leading status endured until 2016, when current contributor [[Mark Fredrickson]] became the most prolific ''Mad'' cover artist with his 98th cover.

Neuman has appeared in one form or another on the cover of nearly every issue of ''Mad'' and its spinoffs since that issue and continuing to the present day, with a small handful of exceptions. Two such departures were ''Mad'' #233 (September 1982) which replaced Neuman's image with that of [[Pac-Man]], and ''Mad'' #195 (December 1977) which instead featured the message "Pssst! Keep This Issue Out of the Hands of Your Parents! (Make 'Em Buy Their Own Copy!)". Even when Neuman is not part of the cover gag, or when the cover is entirely text-based, his disembodied head generally appears in miniature form. The most notorious Neuman-free cover was #166 (April 1974), which featured a human hand giving the profane "middle [[finger (gesture)|finger]]" gesture while declaring ''Mad'' to be "The Number One Ecch Magazine".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madcoversite.com/mad166id.jpg Cover image to ''Mad'' #166 at madcoversite.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Some newsstands that normally carried ''Mad'' chose not to display or sell this issue.

Conversely, the two covers that featured Neuman the most times were #502 (January 2010), and #400 (December 2000).  #502 featured a human hand giving the "[[thumbs down]]" signal, while wearing a silver-spangled glove in the style of singer [[Michael Jackson]].  Each individual spangle, more than 300 in all, was a tiny Alfred E. Neuman face.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madcoversite.com/mad502id.jpg Cover image to ''Mad'' #502 at madcoversite.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  The cover of issue #400 was a [[photomosaic]] of Neuman's face, composed of more than 2,700 images of previous ''Mad'' covers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madcoversite.com/mad400id.jpg Cover image to ''Mad'' #400 at madcoversite.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuman's ubiquity as a grinning cover boy grew as the magazine's circulation quadrupled, but the single highest-selling issue of ''Mad'' depicted only his feet. The cover image of issue #161,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madcoversite.com/mad161id.jpg Cover image to ''Mad'' #161 at madcoversite.com]&lt;/ref&gt; spoofing the 1972 film ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'', showed Neuman floating upside-down inside a life preserver.  The original art for this cover was purchased at auction in 1992 for $2,200 by Annie Gaines, the widow of ''Mad'' founder and publisher [[William Gaines]], and subsequently given on permanent loan to ''Mad'' writer [[Dick DeBartolo]].&lt;ref&gt;DeBartolo, Dick. ''Good Days and Mad: A Hysterical Tour Behind the Scenes at Mad Magazine''. New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The image was copied in 1998 for issue #369 spoofing the hit film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.

A female version of Neuman, named "Moxie Cowznofski", appeared briefly during the late 1950s, occasionally described in editorial text as Neuman's "girlfriend". Neuman and Moxie were sometimes depicted side-by-side, defeating any speculation that Moxie was possibly Neuman in female guise. Her name was inspired by [[Moxie]], a soft drink manufactured in [[Portland, Maine]], which was sold nationwide in the 1950s and whose logo appeared as a running visual gag in many early issues of ''Mad''.

In late 1959, ''Mad'' released a [[single (music)|45 rpm single]] entitled "What—Me Worry?" ([[ABC-Paramount]] 10013), by "Alfred E. Neuman and His Furshlugginer Five", featuring an uncredited voice actor singing as Neuman. (The B-side of the single, "[[Potrzebie]]", is an instrumental.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''Mad'' routinely portrays Neuman in the guise of another character or inanimate object for its cover images.

Since his initial unsuccessful run in 1956, Neuman has periodically been re-offered as a candidate for [[President of the United States|President]] with the slogan, "You could do worse... and always have!"

[[File:Alfred E. Neumann.jpg|left|thumb|Early image of the "Me Worry?" kid, from the early 1950s]]
Along with his face, ''Mad'' also includes a short humorous quotation credited to Neuman with every issue's table of contents. (Example: ''"It takes one to know one... and vice versa!"'')  Some of these quotations were collected in the 1997 book ''Mad: The Half-Wit and Wisdom of Alfred E. Neuman'', which was illustrated by [[Sergio Aragonés]].

Neuman is now used exclusively as a mascot and iconic symbol of the magazine, but before this status was codified, he was referenced in several early articles. In one, Neuman answered a letter from a suicidal reader by giving "expert advice" on the best technique for tying a hangman's knot.  Other articles featured the school newspaper of "Neuman High School", and a bulletin from "Alfred E. Neuman University". An article entitled "Alfred E. Neuman's Family Tree" depicted historical versions of Neuman from various eras. Since then, Neuman has appeared only occasionally inside the magazine's articles. A recurring article titled "Alfred's Poor Almanac" (a parody of [[Poor Richard's Almanac]]) showed his face atop the page, but otherwise the character had no role in the text. In a 1968 article, Neuman's face was assembled, feature by feature, from parts of photographs of well-known politicos, including then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (left ear), [[Richard Nixon]] (nose), [[Oregon]] [[Governor of Oregon|Governor]] [[Mark Hatfield]] (eyes), and [[Ronald Reagan]] (hair). The gap in his teeth (which was otherwise the grin of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]) came from "The '[[Credibility Gap]]' Created by Practically All Politicians".

Neuman's famous [[motto]] is the intellectually incurious "What, me worry?" This was changed for one issue to "Yes, me worry!" after the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979. On the cover of current printings of the paperback ''The Ides of Mad'', as rendered by long-time cover artist Norman Mingo, Neuman is portrayed as a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] bust with his catch phrase engraved on the base, translated into [[Dog Latin]]—''Quid, Me Anxius Sum?''

Neuman's surname is often misspelled as "Newman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22alfred+e.+newman%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=|title=Google search for "Alfred E. Newman"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuman's most prominent physical feature is his gap-toothed grin, with a few notable exceptions. On the cover of issue #236 (January 1983), Neuman was featured with [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]. The cover showed E.T. using his famous "healing finger" to touch Neuman's mouth and cause the missing tooth to appear. The cover of issue #411 (November 2001), the first to be produced following the [[9/11 attacks]] in the United States, showed a close-up of Neuman's face, but his gap was now filled with an [[American flag]]. A text gag on the cover of issue #263 (June 1986) claimed that the [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] was really a "Close-up Photograph of Neuman's Missing Tooth".

Neuman also appeared as himself in a political cartoon{{vague|date=December 2018}}, after ''[[Newsweek]]'' had been criticized for using computer graphics to retouch the teeth of [[McCaughey septuplets|Bobbi McCaughey]]. The cartoon was rendered in the form of a split-screen comparison, in which Neuman was featured on the cover of ''Mad'' with his usual gap-toothed grin, then also featured on the cover of ''Newsweek'', but with a perfect smile.

Despite the primacy of Neuman's incomplete smile, his other facial features have occasionally attracted notice.  Artist [[Andy Warhol]] said that seeing Neuman taught him to love people with big ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/m/mad_magazine/index.html |title=MAD Magazine News |work=The New York Times |first=David |last=Hajdu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, ''Mad'' published letters from several readers noting the resemblance between Neuman and England's [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], then nine years old.&lt;ref&gt;"Letters Dept". ''Mad'' 38 (March 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, an angry letter under a [[Buckingham Palace]] letterhead arrived at the ''Mad'' offices: "Dear Sirs No it isn't a bit—not the least little bit like me. So jolly well stow it! See! Charles. P." The letter was authenticated as having been written on triple-cream laid royal stationery bearing an official copper-engraved crest. The postmark indicated it had been mailed from a post office within a short walking distance of [[Buckingham Palace]]. Unfortunately, the original disappeared years ago while on loan to another magazine and has never been recovered.&lt;ref name=maria&gt;Reidelbach, Maria. ''Completely Mad'', New York: Little Brown, 1991. {{ISBN|0-316-73890-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, ''Mad'' sold prints of the official portrait of Neuman through a small house ad on the letters page of the magazine. In the early years, the price was one for 25 cents; three for 50 cents; nine for a dollar; or 27 for two dollars. The ad stated that the prints could also be used for wrapping fish.

A live-action version of Neuman—an uncredited actor wearing a mask—appears briefly in the 1980 film ''[[Up the Academy]]'' which was originally released to theaters as ''Mad Magazine Presents Up the Academy''. ''Mad'' later pulled its support from the film, and all footage of the Neuman character was excised from North American home video and television releases, although it was reinstated for the 2006 DVD release.

Neuman appeared occasionally in the early seasons of ''[[MADtv]]'' during sketches and interstitials, and briefly appeared in the animated TV series ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]''.

==Genesis==
[[File:The New Boy - Los Angeles Herald.jpg|thumb|The New Boy—1894]]

Neuman's precise origin is shrouded in mystery and may never be fully known.  A collection of early Neumanesque images can be found in [[Maria Reidelbach]]'s comprehensive work, ''Completely Mad: A History of the Comic Book and Magazine'' (Little, Brown, 1991). ''Mad'' publisher [[Bill Gaines]] gave Reidelbach total access to the magazine's own files, including the collection of Neuman-related images that had been assembled for a 1965 copyright infringement lawsuit.&lt;ref name="lawsuit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/342/143/248360|title=Helen Pratt Stuff, Plaintiff-appellant, v. E. C. Publications, Inc., William M. Gaines, Independent News Co., Crown Publishers, Inc., Ballantine Books, Inc., Defendants-appellees, 342 F.2d 143 (2d Cir. 1965)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest image cited in Reidelbach's book is from an advertisement for Atmore's Mince Meat, Genuine English Plum Pudding.  She wrote that, "[d]ating from 1895, this is the oldest verified image of the boy....  The kid's features are fully developed and unmistakable, and the image was very likely taken from an older archetype..."&lt;ref name="maria" /&gt; After the publication of the book, an older "archetype" was discovered in an advertisement for the comical stage play, ''The New Boy'', which debuted on Broadway in 1894.  The image is nearly identical to what later appears in the Atmore's ads.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Peter Jensen Brown, ''The Real Alfred E'', http://therealalfrede.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-real-alfred-e.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A description of the stage play's advertisement was published in the December 2, 1894, ''[[Los Angeles Herald]]''. Using words that could easily be describing the character of Alfred E. Neuman, the paper reported that the "comic red-headed urchin with a joyous grin all over his freckled face, whose phiz [face] is the trademark of the comedy, is so expressive of the rollicking and ridiculous that the New York Herald and the Evening Telegram have applied it to political cartoon purposes."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Elements of the plot of the play explain why the character has adult and childlike features, why the character is dressed as he is, and how he may have lost his teeth.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The original ''New Boy'' image was published with a two-part phrase that is similar in tone to Neuman's, "What? Me Worry?" catch phrase: "What's the good of anything?—Nothing!"&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The ''New Boy'' advertising image was copied widely in advertising for "painless" dentistry and other products.  It is also possible that the image influenced the look of [[The Yellow Kid]], the 1890s character from [[Richard F. Outcault]]'s strip ''Hogan's Alley''.  The image was used for a variety of purposes nearly continuously until it was adopted by ''Mad''.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
[[File:YellowKid.jpeg|thumb|[[The Yellow Kid]], 1897]]
[[File:Antikamnia neuman.jpg|thumb|1908 Antikamnia Tablet Calendar]]
[[File:Me worry? No, I buy auto parts from James Evans Parts Co., 337 West Tyler St., Longview, Texas.jpg|thumb|Postcard from 1930 to 1945 with a similar boy and slogan to ''Mad''{{'}}s Neuman]]

Similar faces turned up in advertising for "painless" dentistry. According to Gaines, 'Alfie' has his origin in Topeka with the Painless Romine Topeka Dental College, actually a dental group at 704 Kansas Avenue, at the office of Dr. William Romine—often misspelled as Romaine—a dentist who resided and practiced in Wichita.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG6tPem4-zc&amp;t=528s&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kshs.org/index.php?url=kansapedia/painless-romine/12186&lt;/ref&gt; A face virtually identical to Neuman's appears in the 1923 issue of the [[University of Minnesota]] humor magazine ''The Guffer'' above the caption "Medic After Passing Con Exam in [[Physical chemistry|P. Chem.]]" Another identical face shows up in the logo for Happy Jack Beverages, a soda drink produced by the A. B. Cook company in 1939. An almost-identical image appeared as "[[nose art]]" on an [[United States|American]] [[World War II]] [[bomber]], over the motto "Me Worry?" (this painted face was sometimes referred to as "The Jolly Boy").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nose-art.net/315th-III/315th-3.htm |title=315th III |publisher=Nose-art.net |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100621051706/http://www.nose-art.net/315th-III/315th-3.htm| archivedate= 21 June 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Neuman's image was also used negatively, as a "supporter" of rival political candidates, with the idea that only an idiot would vote for them.  In 1940, those opposing [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s third-term reelection bid distributed postcards with a similar caricature bearing the caption, "Sure I'm for Roosevelt".  In some instances, there was also the implication that the "idiot" was in fact a [[Jew]]ish caricature. [[Carl Djerassi]]'s autobiography claims that in [[Vienna]] after the [[Anschluss]], he saw posters with a similar face and the caption ''Tod den Juden'' ("Kill the Jews").

The [[EC Comics|EC]] editors grew up listening to radio, and this was frequently reflected in their stories, names and references. The name "Alfred E. Neuman" derived from comedian [[Henry Morgan (comedian)|Henry Morgan]]'s "Here's Morgan" radio series on Mutual, ABC and NBC. One character on his show had a name that was a reference to composer [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]], who scored many films and also composed the [[20th Century Fox#Logo and fanfare|familiar fanfare]] that accompanies [[20th Century Fox]]'s opening film logo.&lt;ref name=kurtzman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://potrzebie.blogspot.com/2008/03/in-early-1950s-bill-gaines-and-harvey.html|title=Kurtzman, Harvey. "That Face on ''Mad'''', February 6, 1975.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible inspiration for Henry Morgan was that [[Laird Cregar]] portrayed Sir [[Henry Morgan]] in ''[[The Black Swan (film)|The Black Swan]]'' (1942) with [[Tyrone Power]], and the Oscar-nominated score for that film was by Newman. Listening to the sarcastic Morgan's brash broadcasts, the ''Mad'' staff took note and reworked the name into Neuman, as later recalled by Kurtzman:

{{bquote|The name Alfred E. Neuman was picked up from [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]], the music arranger from back in the 1940s and 1950s. Actually, we borrowed the name indirectly through ''The Henry Morgan Show''. He was using the name Newman for an innocuous character that you'd forget in five minutes. So we started using the name Alfred Neuman. The readers insisted on putting the name and the face together, and they would call the "What, Me Worry?" face Alfred Neuman.&lt;ref name=kurtzman/&gt;}} Morgan later became a ''Mad'' contributor, with "The Truth about Cowboys" in issue #33.

When ''Mad'' was sued for copyright infringement by a woman claiming to hold the rights to the image, the magazine argued that it had copied the picture from various materials dating back to 1911 (which pre-dated the plaintiff's own claim). The lawsuit was unsuccessful, and the boy's face is now permanently associated with ''Mad''—so much so, in fact, that according to ''Mad'' writer [[Frank Jacobs]], the [[US Post Office]] once delivered a letter to the ''Mad'' offices bearing only a picture of Neuman, without any other address or identifying features.

In 2008, [[Eastern Michigan University]] held an exhibit and symposium on the evolution of Neuman images, dating back to 1877.&lt;ref name="madmumblings.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madmumblings.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3592|title=Mad Mumblings :: View topic – Alfred E.

Several pre–''New Boy'' images that bear some resemblance to Neuman have also been identified.  A number may be seen on John Adcock's ''Mysteries of Melvin'' blog-posting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John |last=Adcock |title=Mysteries of Melvin|url= http://john-adcock.blogspot.com/2010/02/mysteries-of-melvin_17.html}}

In 2012, longtime editor [[Nick Meglin]] offered a streamlined, exasperated version of Neuman's origins:
{{bquote|Oh, don't ask me about Alfred E. Neuman.  That story is so old and so meaningless.  Does the average ''[[Playboy]]'' reader care about where the rabbit came from?

We had 20, and that's the one we settled on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.menafn.com/menafn/05067360-756a-4cd7-b74e-ab3922d3da42/Durham-resident-Meglin-to-speak-about-his-MAD-life?src=main |title=Durham resident Meglin to speak about his MAD life |access-date=2012-12-03 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128124056/http://www.menafn.com/menafn/05067360-756a-4cd7-b74e-ab3922d3da42/Durham-resident-Meglin-to-speak-about-his-MAD-life?src=main |archive-date=2013-01-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Cultural impact==
[[File:Crazy44.jpg|thumb|Alfred E. Neuman has become so closely associated with ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' that the image has even been used to parody the long-running satire magazine itself.]]Over the decades, Neuman has frequently been referenced in outside media, and his face has often appeared in political cartoons as a shorthand for unquestioning stupidity. During the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|administration]] of [[United States]] President George W. Bush, Neuman's features were frequently merged with those of Bush by editorial cartoonists such as [[Mike Luckovich]] and [[Tom Tomorrow]]. The image has also appeared on magazine covers, notably ''[[The Nation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/issue/november-13-2000|title=''The Nation'' November 13 2000|date=13 November 2000|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large Bush/Neuman poster was part of the Washington protests that accompanied Bush's 2001 inauguration. The alleged resemblance between the two has been noted more than once by [[Hillary Clinton]]. On July 10, 2005, speaking at the Aspen Institute's Ideas Festival, she said, "I sometimes feel that Alfred E. Neuman is in charge in Washington," referring to Bush's purported "What, me worry?" attitude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2005/07/12/2005-07-12_gop_big_mad_over_hil_zinger.html Joe Mahoney.

Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner]], then-Presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] joked, "It's often been said that I share the politics of [[Alfred E. Smith]] and the ears of Neuman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/us/politics/17smith.html | work=The New York Times | title=At Dinner, McCain and Obama Share Some Laughs. No Joke | first1=Michael | last1=Cooper | first2=Jeff | last2=Zeleny | date=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neuman's features have also been compared to others in the public eye, including [[Prince Charles]], [[Ted Koppel]], [[Oliver North]] and [[David Letterman]].

Freas painted the August 1971 cover of ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' which merged Neuman's features with those of the court-martialed [[Vietnam War]] murderer [[William Calley]], complete with the phrase, 'What, [[My Lai]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marksverylarge.com/issue-index/1971-08/|title=''National Lampoon'' Issue #17 – Bummer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Neuman's motto has also been referenced in a non-pejorative fashion, as at the [[Woodstock]] Music Festival in 1969. [[Jimi Hendrix]] spoke to the audience about the various changes of personnel in his band, and their lack of rehearsal time, while saying "What, me worry?"  The tenth ''[[American Idol]]'' winner, [[Scotty McCreery]], has a striking resemblance to Neuman.  When judge [[Steven Tyler]] pointed this out on the show, McCreery replied, "What, me worry?"

In an extended sequence of the comic strip ''[[Peanuts]]'' from 1973 (later recreated in the 1983 TV special ''It's An Adventure, Charlie Brown''), [[Charlie Brown]] becomes so obsessed with baseball that everything round starts looking like a baseball to him. Soon his own round head develops a rash that makes the back of his skull look like a baseball, and he starts wearing a paper bag on his head to hide it. Ironically, while hidden from view, his popularity and respect increase. He is referred to by the other campers as "Mr. Sack" or "Sack", but is also voted camp president and is widely admired. The rash eventually fades from his head, but Charlie Brown still fears that the next round thing he expects to see—a sunrise—may continue to look like a baseball. When the sun does rise, it instead looks like Neuman, with a halo reading: "What! Me Worry?"! &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peanuts.com/comicstrips/3261561/|title=Peanuts, July 5, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationnation.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=8;t=001436;p=|title=Animation Nation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuman also appeared as a sight gag in the March 27, 1967 installment of the comic strip ''[[Beetle Bailey]]'', as an inspector general.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Mort. ''I Don't Want to be Out Here Any More Than You Do, Beetle Bailey''. New York: Tempo books, 1970. {{ISBN|0-448-12256-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He can also be spotted in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #300, helping [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] move into their new house, while saying, "Darn! I'm missing the [[New Jersey Nets|Nets]] game! That makes me Mad!" Similarly, when, in 1959's ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #126, [[Superman]] decides to test [[Lois Lane]] by removing a rubber Superman mask in order to reveal his "real" identity, his identity is none other than Neuman. [[DC Comics]]' "[[Joker (comics)|Emperor Joker]]" storyline includes a cult that worships a deity named Alfred E.; the high priest of this cult wears a mask identical to Neuman's face.

Neuman and ''Mad'' have been referenced several times on the animated series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. In the episode "[[Marge in Chains]]", [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] is arrested and in prison she meets an inmate called Tattoo Annie who has a [[Mad fold-in|fold-in]] tattoo that reveals Neuman with the text: "What me Worry?". The original phrase was "What kind of slime would I marry?". In the episode "[[The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson]]", [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] comes into contact with Neuman during a visit to the ''Mad'' offices. Neuman demands to see "Kaputnik and Fonebone" (which are references to deceased long-time ''Mad'' artists [[Dave Berg (cartoonist)|Dave Berg]] and [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]], respectively) for their work on ''New Kids on the Blecch'' (which would later become the title of another episode), and requests some "furshlugginer [[pastrami]] sandwiches". An awestruck Bart announces that he will "never wash these eyes again". In the episode "[[New Kids on the Blecch]]", Bart's boy band is booked to play a gig on an aircraft carrier, but their band manager plots to use the craft's weaponry to destroy the ''Mad'' offices when he discovers the magazine plans to publish a defamatory article about the band. ''Mad'''s New York headquarters were depicted as a skyscraper similar to the [[Chrysler Building]] with a giant three-dimensional replica of Neuman's head mounted on the roof.  In the episode "[[Father Knows Worst]]", Homer and Bart visit a hobby shop which includes an [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora model]]-style kit of Neuman holding several protest signs.

In a segment of his 1958 television special, [[Fred Astaire]] danced while wearing a rubber Neuman mask.&lt;ref&gt;Reidelbach, Maria, ''Completely Mad'', pg. 203, Little Brown &amp; Co., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' made multiple references to Neuman, including episode #602 featuring ''[[Invasion U.S.A. (1952 film)|Invasion U.S.A.]]'' Upon seeing director [[Alfred E. Green]]'s name in the film's opening credits, [[Crow T. Robot]], in a slightly idiotic tone, riffs "What? Me direct?" An animated 1996 sketch on ''[[MADtv]]'' combining ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'' with ''[[The Godfather]]'' was credited to "[[Mario Puzo|Alfred E. Puzo]]" and "[[Francis Ford Coppola|Francis E. Neuman]]".

Another homage to the name was "Al Freddy Newham", as used on the cover of the April 1967 issue of the amateur radio enthusiast's ''[[73 (magazine)|73 Magazine]]'', preparing to ineptly solder the frayed cord of a soldering gun with the same damaged gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolabworks.com/73mag/73_6.html|title=73 Magazine – Mad Parody Cover|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neuman appears briefly, in clay animated form, in Jimmy Picker's 1983 stop motion animated film, ''Sundae in New York''.  He also makes a cameo in the 1988 [[Daffy Duck]] cartoon ''[[The Night of the Living Duck]]''. A [[doodle]] of Neuman appears on a soldier's helmet in [[Oliver Stone]]'s 1986 Vietnam film ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]''.  Lyrically, Neuman is invoked by the [[Beastie Boys]] on their song "[[Shadrach (Beastie Boys song)|Shadrach]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sklar.com/page/article/shadrach |title=A Postmodern Analysis of Beastie Boys' "Shadrach" |publisher=sklar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1980 ''[[Password Plus]]'' episode featured Neuman's name as an answer, using the clues "Freckles", "Mad", "Magazine", "Cover", and "Kid". ([[Elaine Joyce]] solved the puzzle after "Cover"). He can be glimpsed holding a fish on the cover of the album ''[[Slow Motion (Man album)|Slow Motion]]'' by [[Man (band)|Man]].

A statue of Neuman can be found at the [[Dort Mall]] in [[Flint, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/the_mel/9363398782/in/photolist-fgpSf3-DwZzT |title=Statue of Neuman at the Dort Mall in Flint, Michigan |publisher=flickr.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amateur television''' ('''ATV''') is the transmission of [[broadcast quality]] [[video]] and [[sound reproduction|audio]] over the wide range of frequencies of [[radio wave]]s allocated for [[radio amateur]] (Ham) use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/spectrum/spectrum-policy-area/spectrum-management/UK-FAT-Table-2008/ukfat08.pdf|title=United Kingdom Frequency allocation table |work=Publication date 2008 (Issue No. 15)|publisher=Ofcom|accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ATV is used for [[non-commercial]] experimentation, pleasure, and public service events. Ham TV stations were on the air in many cities before [[commercial television]] stations came on the air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlytelevision.org/1940_home_camera.html Kowalewski, Anthony, "An Amateur's Television Transmitter"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924185654/http://www.earlytelevision.org/1940_home_camera.html |date=2011-09-24 }}, ''Radio News'', April 1938. Early Television Museum and Foundation Website. Retrieved 19 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Various transmission standards are used, these include the broadcast transmission standards of [[NTSC]] in [[North America]] and [[Japan]], and [[PAL]] or [[SECAM]] elsewhere, utilizing the full [[refresh rate]]s of those standards. ATV includes the study of building of such [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]], and the study of [[radio propagation]] of signals travelling between transmitting and receiving stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsgb.org/propagation/|title=HF - Propagation Predictions from the United Kingdom|work=Publication date November 2010|publisher=Radio Society of Great Britain|accessdate=26 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101024041458/http://www.rsgb.org/propagation/| archivedate= 24 October 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATV is an extension of [[amateur radio]]. It is also called HAM TV or fast-scan TV (FSTV), as opposed to [[slow-scan television]] (SSTV). SSTV is a method of transmitting still images over radio, when it is not possible to send video.

==North American context==
In [[North America]], [[Amateur radio frequency allocations|amateur radio bands]] that are suitable for a television signal ([[wideband|wide]] enough to fit such a signal) are higher in frequency than VHF broadcast TV. The lowest frequency ham band suitable for television transmission is [[70 centimeters]], which is between broadcast channels 13 and 14. While outside of broadcast television channels, this frequency falls into [[Cable television|CATV]] [[North American cable television frequencies|frequencies]], on channels 57 to 61 [[North American television frequencies#Incrementally-related carriers .28IRC.29|(IRC)]] (420–450&amp;nbsp;[[Megahertz|MHz]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jneuhaus.com/fccindex/cablech.html|title=Cable TV Channel Frequencies|last=Neuhaus|first=John|date=2005-10-19|publisher=John Neuhaus|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, ATV transmissions can be viewed by setting a television or analog cable-box to cable input and attaching an outdoor antenna. For more sensitive reception, some users may use a purposely-built ATV down-converter, which is a kind of [[set-top-box]]. Other bands are also used for ATV, most of them in the [[UHF]] region on frequencies higher than UHF broadcast TV. [[33 centimeters]] and [[23 centimeters]] are two other commonly used bands for ATV, but reception of these higher bands requires the use of a down-converter.

Most ATV signals are transmitted in either [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulation (AM)]] or [[Single-sideband modulation#Vestigial sideband (VSB)|vestigial sideband (VSB)]] [[NTSC]] (North American analog TV broadcast modulation standard){{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. DSB AM and VSB AM signals are inherently compatible with each other, and most televisions can receive either. DSB-AM signals consists of the carrier and both upper and lower sidebands. VSB-AM is where DSB-AM is filtered and the lower sideband is highly attenuated at frequencies more than 1.25&amp;nbsp;MHz from the carrier signal. A VSB filter can be added to a DSB-AM transmitter to make it a VSB signal. The filters, depending on power usage, will cost anywhere from US$100–1,000. For practical reasons, most individual ATV users transmit in DSB-AM, and VSB is transmitted by repeater stations. On the 33&amp;nbsp;cm and higher bands, [[frequency modulation|frequency modulation (FM)]] ATV may be used, and on the [[Super high frequency|SHF]] and [[Extremely high frequency|EHF]] ham bands, FM is more commonly used than VSB or AM. FM ATV is incompatible with AM/VSB ATV, and a separate [[demodulator]] is necessary to receive signals.

===2 m band===
The [[2-meter band]] (144-148&amp;nbsp;MHz), while too narrow in [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] for an analog video signal, is often used by ATV operators for coordination with each other via FM voice transmissions. Operators seeking an ATV contact might first attempt calling on a regionally recognized ATV liaison-frequency, commonly 144.34&amp;nbsp;MHz, then agree to an ATV frequency to use for the video transmissions. The 2 meter frequency may be used throughout the contact to talk back to the current station transmitting video. The receiving station(s) may suggest adjustments the sending station can make, such as antenna direction, to improve the quality of the video received. The band lies within cable channel 18.

===70 cm band===
The [[70-centimeter band]] (420-450&amp;nbsp;MHz) is the most commonly used ham band for ATV. Signals transmitted on this band usually propagate longer distances than on higher frequency bands, for a given transmitter power and antenna gain. The band falls between [[North American television frequencies#Channel frequencies|broadcast TV channels]] 13 and 14, which are 210–216&amp;nbsp;MHz and 470–476&amp;nbsp;MHz respectively. Propagation is similar to the lowest UHF TV Broadcast channels.

Additionally, this band can be easily received by simply tuning any cable-ready analog television or cable-box to the cable TV channels below and connecting an outdoor TV antenna. Amateur TV signals are much weaker than broadcast TV, so a [[preamplifier]] is often used to improve reception.

Usage notes:
# In Canada and areas of the US north of a designated "Line A" boundary, amateurs are not allowed to transmit on these channels.&lt;ref&gt;''Line A'' is defined in the US Federal Code of Regulations Part 47,[https://books.google.com/books?id=OiJ06kZsytsC&amp;pg=PA455&amp;dq=FCC+%22Line+A%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=29N4TuHaD8ic0QXLzcCGDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=FCC%20%22Line%20A%22&amp;f=false] and runs from Aberdeen, Washington to Searsport, Maine , roughly parallel to the Canada–US border in several segments.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITUv1p38"&gt;{{cite book|title=ITU Radio Regulations, Volume 1|date=2012|publisher=International Telecommunications Union|page=38|edition=2012, Volume 1|url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-s/oth/02/02/S02020000244501PDFE.PDF|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Usually used as an ATV repeater output. Expensive VSB filters must be used on this channel to keep the signal inside the ham band.
# Channels 58 and 59 are often offset in frequency to limit [[Radio frequency interference|interference]] to the [[weak-signal]] and [[amateur radio satellite]] sub-bands (431–433 &amp; 435–438&amp;nbsp;MHz respectively). Many modern CATV receivers can still lock-on to frequencies offset as much as 1&amp;nbsp;MHz.
# Rarely used today due to heavy FM repeater use in this range.
# For technical reasons, a maximum of two channels may be simultaneously used within a given geographic area, and the video carrier frequencies must be at least 12&amp;nbsp;MHz apart for the signals not to interfere with each other.

===33 cm band===
The [[33-centimeter band]] (902-928&amp;nbsp;MHz) is next highest frequency ham band available for ATV in North America. This ham band is unique to [[International Telecommunication Union region|ITU Region 2]], and it is rarely available for amateur use in ITU Regions 1 or 3.&lt;ref name="ITUv1-33cm"&gt;{{cite book|title=ITU Radio Regulations, Volume 1|date=2012|publisher=International Telecommunications Union|pages=96–98|edition=2012, Volume 1|url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-s/oth/02/02/S02020000244501PDFE.PDF|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This band is also shared with many users, including [[ISM band|ISM]] devices and unlicensed [[Part 15]] users, so interference issues are more likely than on other bands.

These channels can be received by many newer analog cable-boxes and televisions, which can tune to channels above 125.

Usage notes:
# Available, but no known usage.
# In portions of [[Colorado]] and [[Wyoming]], amateurs are not allowed to transmit ATV on this channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Regulatory/Part%2097%20-%2004-28-2011.pdf 47 C.F.R. §97.303(n)3 as of 14 Feb 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
# May interfere with growing FM use on the 927–928&amp;nbsp;MHz sub-band.
# For technical reasons, a maximum of two channels may be simultaneously used within a given geographic area, and the video carrier frequencies must be at least 12&amp;nbsp;MHz apart for the signals not to interfere with each other.

Additionally 33&amp;nbsp;cm is the lowest frequency band on which higher-quality [[frequency modulation|frequency modulated]] amateur TV occurs. This format gives better picture quality than standard AM television. The FM television format used is identical to [[TVRO|big dish analog satellite]] television and can be received by some tuners which can tune this low in frequency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qsl.net/ki7cx/aatv_f.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise a specialized FM amateur TV receiver is needed.

===23 cm band===
The [[23-centimeter band]] (1240-1300&amp;nbsp;MHz) is the third highest frequency band available for ATV. Analog big-dish satellite television ([[TVRO]]) receivers may be re-purposed for inexpensively receiving ATV in this band. Such receivers can decode FM television when an outdoor antenna is connected to the [[Low noise block-downconverter|LNB]] input. Due to the low cost and ease of repurposing old analog satellite receivers, this is the most popular band for FM amateur TV.

Commonly used 23&amp;nbsp;cm FM channels:
*1,255&amp;nbsp;MHz
*1,265&amp;nbsp;MHz

This band is also used for AM/VSB television, although this requires a specialized receiver.

Usage notes:
# Expensive VSB filters must be used on this channel to keep the signal inside the ham band.
# All of the video carrier frequencies are 12&amp;nbsp;MHz apart to allow for each channel to be used simultaneously in a given geographic area without causing interference to each other.

===Other amateur radio bands===
In addition to the above, there are other ham bands which are less commonly used for ATV:

*On the [[13-centimeter band]]:
**2,417.5&amp;nbsp;MHz is used for ATV links.
**2,441.5&amp;nbsp;MHz is the band's most used FM ATV frequency. A 6.0&amp;nbsp;MHz audio [[sub-carrier]] and 4&amp;nbsp;MHz deviation are used.
*The [[9-centimeter band|9 centimeter (3 GHz)]] and [[5-centimeter band|5 centimeter (5 GHz)]] bands have ATV links in some areas.
*On the [[3-centimeter band]], 10.4&amp;nbsp;GHz is a wideband FM channel, and it may be used as an ATV repeater input.

===Other information===
The distance record for ATV is between Hawaii and California (2518 miles) on 434&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hamtv.com/atvdxrecord.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments with [[Digital television|digital modes]] have lagged somewhat behind those in Europe, but have taken on some new urgency given the [[DTV transition in the United States|transition of broadcast television]]. WR8ATV currently has an output using [[DVB-S]], which is believed to be the first DATV repeater in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atco.tv/|title=Amateur Television in Central Ohio|publisher=ATCO|accessdate=2009-05-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090427005206/http://www.atco.tv/| archivedate= 27 April 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is now a DATV downlink on the ISS operating in the amateur 2.4 GHz band.

==European context==
In [[Europe]], which generally has a narrower [[70-centimeter band|70 cm]] allocation than the USA, the majority of amateur television operation is currently [[frequency modulated]] on {{nowrap|1.2 GHz}} and above. The frequencies in use depend on national permissions. In most of mainland Europe, the most common frequency is 1255&amp;nbsp;MHz. Other bands commonly used for ATV are the [[13-centimeter band|13cm]] ({{nowrap|~2.3–2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz}}) and [[3-centimeter band|3-cm]] ({{nowrap|~10 GHz}}) bands, although ATV is used on most of the microwave bands.

In several countries [[Crossband operation|cross-band]] [[repeater]]s are used, with [[Amplitude Modulation|AM]] inputs on 430&amp;nbsp;MHz and [[Frequency modulation|FM]] outputs on {{nowrap|1255 MHz}}, others have FM-ATV inputs on {{nowrap|13 cm}} and outputs on {{nowrap|3 cm}}.

In the [[United Kingdom]], much activity occurs using [[in-band]] [[repeater]]s. These generally have an input of 1248, 1249 or 1255&amp;nbsp;MHz and typically output at 1308, 1312 or 1316&amp;nbsp;MHz, although other frequencies are also used. [[Simplex]] operation occurs on these or other frequencies chosen to avoid interference with other users of the band, e.g. {{nowrap|1285 MHz}}. Recent [[experiment]]s have been done with [[digital television|digital]] modes following widely adopted [[DVB-S]] and [[DVB-T]] standards. These new DATV transmissions need less spectrum bandwidth than FM-ATV and offer superior picture quality. However, the unavoidable processing delays caused by the temporal compression mean that DATV signals have a second or more of time lag, which can make real-time video conversations feel much less natural than the 'instantaneous' analogue system.

==Transmission characteristics==
[[File:Hanoverbars without PAL delay.png|thumb|right|Typical fast scan test card showing "Hanover bars" (colour banding) effect in Pal S (simple) signal mode of transmission.]]
Typically [[frequency modulated]] [[television|TV]] is used on frequencies above 1,240&amp;nbsp;MHz (1.24&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|GHz]]), where there is enough [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] for such [[wideband]] [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]]s. This is often used as a repeater's input [[frequency]], with output being standard [[Single-sideband modulation#Vestigial sideband (VSB)|VSB]] on the four channels listed above.

In a nutshell
* below 1.24&amp;nbsp;GHz: Vestigial Sideband
* above 1.24&amp;nbsp;GHz: [[frequency modulation|FM]], [[Phase-shift keying|PSK]] etc...

The quality of transmission is expressed as a "p level"; "p" standing for "picture". P levels range from zero to five, increasing as the picture becomes more viewable. P-0 signifies a state in which [[sync bar]]s are visible, but the picture is too snowy to be seen; this occurs at a minimum signal strength of 3&amp;nbsp;dB. Each level represents an increase of 6&amp;nbsp;dB over the previous; P-5 is 30&amp;nbsp;dB above P-0 and represents a perfectly clear picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.atco.tv/plevel.aspx |title=ATV P level illustration |access-date=2009-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617225854/http://www.atco.tv/plevel.aspx |archive-date=2009-06-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Range===
As transmission frequency increases, atmospheric [[path loss]]es become greater, particularly at frequencies above 10&amp;nbsp;GHz. Additionally, long-distance propagation by [[F region|F-layer]] ionospheric skip over the horizon does not typically occur at higher frequencies, and terrain and man-made structures can affect propagation of signals, blocking or redirecting signals. Factors such as [[E-skip|E-layer skip]] propagation, [[Tropospheric propagation|tropospheric enhancement]], and [[Knife-edge effect|knife-edge diffraction]] can extend the useful range of signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The ARRL Handbook For Radio Communications | edition = 82nd | year = 2005 | publisher = [[American Radio Relay League]] | isbn = 0-87259-928-0 | pages = 20.3, 20.6 | chapter = Propagation of RF Signals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
[[File:Hanover bars with PAL delay.png|thumb|right| Test transmission signal for chrominance and luminance signals check using Pal D (delay line) encoding - colour "hanover Bars" effect no longer visible.]]
Content produced by ATV has included:

*From 1968 to about 2004 amateur TV provided behind-the-scenes co-ordination for the annual New Year's Day [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] in Pasadena, CA.
*HAM TV—as it is also called—provides video co-ordination of many public service events and, along with traditional amateur radio, provides much needed "eyes" in natural disasters.
*U.S. stations often retransmitted [[NASA TV]] while they were not in use, especially when there were [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space exploration|missions]].
*In recent history, amateur TV has found renewed interest in the radio-controlled hobby world as a method for transmitting [[First-person view (radio control)|FPV video]], for use when flying remote control aircraft or piloting other RC vehicles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3992">The '''Art School Cheerleaders''' were a [[performance art]] troupe that used cheerleading as a medium for satirical, political and social commentary on the arts and their place in our society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smfa.edu/Gateways/Alumni/Alumni_Profiles/Alumni_Profile_Rebecca_Goldberg_Oliver.asp SMFA Boston - Alumni Profile: Rebecca Goldberg Oliver&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516173106/http://www.smfa.edu/Gateways/Alumni/Alumni_Profiles/Alumni_Profile_Rebecca_Goldberg_Oliver.asp |date=2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Style Weekly May 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally existing as the SMFA Cheerleaders at the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|School of the Museum of Fine Arts]] from 1996-1998, the SMFA Cheerleaders performed at venues such as Banned In Boston, a benefit which included city luminaries such as the mayor of Boston, and the ''[[Car Talk]]'' anniversary show: A Tribute to Click and Clack: Celebrating 20 years of Bad Car Advice. They were featured in numerous publications including the Sunday Boston Globe, the Sunday New York Times, and the August 1997 issue of Playboy, which featured an anti-[[censorship]] cheer that they had penned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/03/education/a-new-tactic-for-rousing-and-razzing-arts-crowd.html | work=New York Times|date= August 4, 1997|title=A New Tactic for Rousing and Razzing Arts Crowd|author=TONY MARCANO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boston Sunday Globe, March 2, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle for Higher Education, April 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Playboy, Aug 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boston Herald, March 24, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The SMFA Cheerleaders also performed on the main stage at the Art Now! March on Washington in support of the arts during the massive 1997 [[National Endowment for the Arts]] budget cuts.

Several of the Art School Cheerleaders were also members of [[Bad Girrls Studios]], a popular artist-run Boston gallery that hosted numerous public art events.

The Art Cheerleaders were resurrected in 2007 in [[Richmond, Virginia]] by one of the co-founders of the SMFA group, Rebecca Goldberg, who pulled together and worked with Richmond artists from many genres to advocate for arts funding in the Richmond area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://styleweekly.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=EF80E7024DF94CD8B7C07D52BB7FAD8E |work=Style Weekly|date= May 30, 2007|title=Give Me an "M-F-A!"}}&lt;/ref&gt; This iteration of the group received a Muse Award for Creativity in Business from the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmfa.museum/muse_winners.html | title=2008 VMFA Muse Award Winners|publisher=Virginia Museum of Fine Arts|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314004247/http://www.vmfa.museum/muse_winners.html|archivedate=March 14, 2008 |date=March 7, 2008|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was featured as the cover story for Richmond Style Weekly's 2007 year-in-review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://styleweekly.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=70D180B897F040D7982D2C5543EE27BF |work=Style Weekly|date= December 26, 2007|title=The Score|author=Scott Bass}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group separated in late 2008 after leading a parade through the City of Richmond commemorating the 30th anniversary of Richmond's oldest non-profit space for new art, the 1708 Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readthehook.com/blog/index.php/2008/09/03/inlight-richmond-celebrates-1708-gallerys-30th-anniversary/ |work=The Hook|date=September 3, 2008|title="InLight Richmond" celebrates 1708 Gallery's 30th Anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Asphalt 7: Heat''''' is a {{vgy|2012}} [[racing video game]], developed and published by [[Gameloft]]. It is part of the [[Asphalt (series)|''Asphalt'' series]]. It was released on June 21, 2012 for the [[iOS]]&lt;ref name="Slide" /&gt; and marks the first time in the series that a game is the same for both the [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]]. The game was launched for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] on June 25,&lt;ref name="Androidrelease" /&gt; for [[BlackBerry 10]] on February 21, 2013,&lt;ref name="blackberry" /&gt; for [[Windows Phone 8]] on February 27,&lt;ref name="Windows" /&gt; for [[BlackBerry PlayBook]] on April 3,&lt;ref name="PlayBook" /&gt; and for [[Windows 8]] (via [[Windows Store]]) on August 22.,&lt;ref name="Windows 8" /&gt; [[Windows 10]] on July 29, 2015. The game was pulled from the app stores at an unknown date.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Asphalt 7 gameplay.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Gameplay in ''Asphalt 7''. The player is currently [[Drifting (motorsport)|drifting]].]]
Gameplay in ''Asphalt 7'' is very similar to that of previous games in the ''Asphalt'' series, with the player given the option of tilting the device, touching the side of the screen, or using an onscreen virtual steering-wheel to steer. The game also has an [[Multiplayer online game|online multiplayer]] mode, both [[Local area network|local]] through [[Wi-Fi]] and [[Bluetooth]], and [[Global network|global]] through an [[Internet access|internet connection]].

The five star rating system for each race, the use of primary and secondary objectives and the "Adrenaline mode" from ''[[Asphalt 6: Adrenaline]]'' have all been retained in ''Asphalt 7''.

===Cars===
There are 80 licensed cars available in the game, divided into 7 tiers. The player starts with one car in each tier; the [[Fiat 500 (2007)#Special versions|Abarth 500 ESSEESSE]] (Tier 1), the [[BMW 1 Series (E87)#1M Coupé|BMW 1 Series M Coupé]] (Tier 2), the [[Dodge Challenger#SRT8|Dodge Challenger SRT8]] (Tier 3), the [[Cadillac CTS-V#CTS-V Coupe|Cadillac CTS-V Coupé]] (Tier 4), the [[Nissan GT-R]] (Tier 5), the [[Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZR1|Chevrolet Corvette ZR1]] (Tier 6) and the [[Ruf Rt 12|Ruf Rt 12 S]] (Tier 7).

Other cars to become available as the player progresses include, in Tier 1, the [[Range Rover Evoque]], [[DeLorean DMC-12]], [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class#SportCoupé (CL203, 2000–2008)|Mercedes-Benz Classe C Coupé]] and [[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Tesla Roadster]]; in Tier 2, the [[Plymouth Prowler]], [[Chevrolet Camaro (fifth generation)|Chevrolet Camaro GS]], [[Dodge Charger (LX)#Police package version|Dodge Charger SRT8 Police]] and [[Lotus Exige#Exige S (2006-2007)|Lotus Exige S]]; in Tier 3, the [[Lotus Evora|Lotus Evora S]], [[BMW M6|BMW M6 Coupé]], [[Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione|Alfa Romeo 8C]] and [[Lamborghini Sesto Elemento]]; in Tier 4, the [[Dodge Viper#Viper ACR-X|Dodge Viper ACR-X]], [[Lamborghini Countach#25th Anniversary Countach|Lamborghini Countach 25th Anniversary]], [[Ferrari California]] and [[Mazda Furai]]; in Tier 5, the [[Cadillac CTS-V#CTS-V Coupe|Cadillac CTS-V Coupé Race Car]], [[Ferrari 458|Ferrari 458 Italia]], [[Lamborghini Gallardo#LP 570-4 Spyder Performante|Lamborghini Gallardo LP 570-4 Spyder Performante]], [[Marussia B2]] and [[Ferrari 575M Maranello]]; in Tier 6, the [[McLaren MP4-12C]], [[Enzo Ferrari (automobile)|Ferrari Enzo]], [[Lamborghini Reventón]] and [[Aston Martin One-77]]; and in Tier 7, the [[Ferrari 288 GTO]], [[Ruf CTR3]], [[McLaren F1]] and [[Bugatti Veyron#Bugatti Veyron Super Sport|Bugatti Veyron Super Sport]]. The fastest car available to the player is the [[Koenigsegg Agera#Koenigsegg Agera R|Koenigsegg Agera R]] (Tier 7)

Due to [[Electronic Arts]]' ownership of the [[Porsche]] license, there are no Porsche vehicles, although there are tuned variants by [[Ruf Automobile|Ruf]].

===Locations===
''Asphalt 7'' features almost all of the locations from ''Asphalt 6: Adrenaline'', as well as adding new tracks, forming a total of 15 tracks. The locations are [[New York City|New York]], [[Hawaii]], [[Havana]], [[Los Angeles]],  [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], [[Paris]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Tokyo]], [[Moscow]], [[New Orleans]], [[Reykjavík]], [[London]], [[Alps]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Miami]].

Upon its release, ''Asphalt 7'' received generally favorable reviews. The iOS version holds an aggregate score of 83 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]], based on seventeen reviews,&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/asphalt-7-heat|title=Asphalt 7: Heat (iOS)|publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a score of 81% on [[GameRankings]], based on seven reviews.&lt;ref name="GR"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gamerankings.com/iphone/674894-asphalt-7-heat/index.html|title=Asphalt 7: Heat for iOS|publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IGN]]'s George Roush was enthusiastic about the game, awarding a score of 8 out of 10, and concluding "If you're as much of a fan of the ''Asphalt'' series as I am then you're going to love ''Heat''. It's nice to see that Gameloft is improving each entry while managing to keep the cost low. Race junkies are going to love looking for shortcuts, catching air and blasting their way through the beautiful looking tracks to the sound of energetic [[techno]] music."&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ie.ign.com/articles/2012/07/19/asphalt-7-heat-review|title=Asphalt 7: Heat Review |publisher=[[IGN]]|first=George |last=Roush|date=July 18, 2012|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; TouchGen's Dave LeClair was also impressed, scoring the game 4 out of 5; "Overall, this is a great racing game. It has a couple of minor flaws, but nothing gamebreaking. The social sharing hooks after every race can be a little annoying, and they delay the time getting to the next race. Still, slight problems aside, fans of racing games will enjoy the total package offered in ''Asphalt 7: Heat''."&lt;ref name="Touch Gen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touchgen.net/asphalt-7-heat-review |title=Asphalt 7: Heat Review |publisher=TouchGen |first=Dave |last=LeClair |date=June 21, 2012 |accessdate=June 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605165637/http://www.touchgen.net/asphalt-7-heat-review |archivedate=June 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Caplan of 148Apps also scored it 4 out of 5, praising the graphics and controls, although criticizing the gameplay as being very similar to its predecessors; "for the price ''Asphalt 7'' is one of the best arcade racers on iOS. What it lacks in originality it makes up for in polish."&lt;ref name="148Apps"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.148apps.com/reviews/asphalt-7-heat-review/|title=Asphalt 7: Heat Review |publisher=148Apps|first=Lisa|last= Caplan|date=June 22, 2012|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slide to Play's Nadia Oxford was somewhat less impressed, feeling the game wasn't differentiated enough from the previous games in the series, an argument Andrew Podolsky had made in his review of ''Asphalt 6'' for the site. As with both ''[[Asphalt 5]]'' and ''Asphalt 6'', the game was scored 3 out of 4. Oxford wrote "The ''Asphalt'' series needs someone to open the windows and let some fresh air in, but it's still impossible to go really go wrong with ''Asphalt 7: Heat''. If you're still happy with ''Asphalt 6'' and you want to save that dollar for ice cream, go ahead and hang onto ''Adrenaline''. You'll live without ''Heat''. But if you don't own an ''Asphalt'' game, or if any upgrades to the series makes you happy, regardless of how small those upgrades are, go ahead and grab ''Asphalt 7: Heat''. It's still money well-spent."&lt;ref name="Slide"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.slidetoplay.com/story/asphalt-7-heat-review|title=Asphalt 7: Heat Review |publisher=Slide to Play|first=Nadia|last= Oxford |date=June 21, 2012|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[MacLife]]''{{'}}s Matt Clark scored the game 3 out of 5, also criticizing its similarity to earlier games in the series, but praising the graphics; "if there's one way that ''Asphalt 7'' improves the series, it's the visual presentation. The vehicles and environments look fantastic on the [[Retina Display]]."&lt;ref name="Mac"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.maclife.com/article/reviews/asphalt_7_heat_review|title=Asphalt 7: Heat Review |publisher=''[[MacLife]]'' |first=Matt|last= Clark|date=August 3, 2012|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan Whitwam of AndroidPolice was less enthused and was heavily critical of several aspects, such as the need to be online for the game to work, the use of real world money and, especially, the graphics; "the deal breaker for me is the overwhelming mediocrity of the graphics. Judging from the screenshots on the [[Google Play|Play Store]] page, this should be a gorgeous game. Instead, it's just average. Even then, only on some devices. On the [[Google Nexus#Nexus 7|Nexus 7]] the texture [[Display resolution|resolution]] is absolutely terrible. Everything in the environment looks muddy. The cars aren't bad, but there is noticeable [[aliasing]] along the edges."&lt;ref name="Android"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2012/07/28/asphalt-7-review-a-racing-game-that-never-quite-makes-it-off-the-starting-line/|title=Asphalt 7 Review: A Racing Game That Never Quite Makes It Off The Starting Line |publisher=Android Police|first=Ryan |last=Whitwam |date=July 28, 2012|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wired (website)|Wired.com]]'s Ryan Rigney was even more critical, scoring the game 6 out of 10 and criticising the implementation of in-app purchases; "I can't imagine anyone ever spending money on them. Even if you buy the $100 pack of 200 stars, that still won't unlock everything in the game; not by a long shot. So what's the point?" Rigney did however, praise the graphics, arguing that the game has a "polish that would be impressive for an [[Xbox Live Arcade]] game. No other arcade racer on the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] comes close to matching ''Asphalt 7''{{'}}s presentation quality."&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/06/review-asphalt-7-heat/|title=Review: Obnoxious Social Features Put the Brakes on Asphalt 7|publisher=[[Wired (website)|Wired.com]] |first=Ryan|last= Rigney |date=June 28, 2012|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tech blogger Thomas Baekdal calculated that "unlocking everything in the game will cost you almost $3,500."&lt;ref name="Baekdal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baekdal.com/opinion/optimizing-your-industry-to-the-point-of-suicide/|title=Optimizing Your Industry to the Point of Suicide|publisher=Baekdal.com |first=Thomas|last= Baekdal |date=August 30, 2012|accessdate=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''B.A.T.''''' (expanded: '''''Bureau of Astral Troubleshooters''''') is a futuristic [[point and click]] [[adventure game]] with some [[role-playing video game]]  elements. It was released in 1989 and available on several home computer platforms. It was developed by [[Computer's Dream]] and published by [[Ubi Soft]]. A sequel, ''[[B.A.T. II – The Koshan Conspiracy]]'', was released in 1992.

==Atari ST dongle==
The Atari ST version shipped with a dongle purporting to be a 16-channel sound card. This was required to play the game, but resulted in no sound being transmitted to the attached monitor or television, and to get any sound at all the user was forced to either play the game wearing headphones plugged into the dongle, or purchase external speakers. It is also dubious whether the dongle produced higher quality sound, since the music did not feature any more channels than regular sound-chip music.

The card actually contained a 12-bit DAC, giving the dynamic range for 16 simultaneous 8-bits samples at the expense of the CPU given the lack of DMA.  The game audio itself only used up to 4 simultaneous samples.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' praised the NPCs and graphics of the Amiga version of ''B.A.T.'', but criticized the combat, puzzles, user interface, and arcade sequences. The magazine advised traditional RPG fans to avoid the game.{{r|cgw199106}}

==Reception==
The TV critic for ''Sydney Morning Herald'' thought there was an uneasy co-existence between the depiction of the Ned Kelly gang "as young hoodlums of today in a dream-setting" and "conventional and "Patriot" type inserts of the haughty, high-cravatted police official Captain Standish" and the "slapstick" bank holdup scene. He added that John Bell "played his role with fine command and energy, but had all too little chance to develop his subject or do it justice" and felt the play had "little to say either about Kelly or his story" and "often moved sluggishly and unconvincingly."&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wHtWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MeYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3310%2C4860783|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|title=Ballad of One Gun|date=18 July 1963|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"'''Booby Trap'''" is the sixth episode of the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 3)|third season]] of the American [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', the 54th episode overall, first broadcast on October 30, 1989.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] starship ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]''. In this episode, the ''Enterprise'' discovers a derelict centuries-old alien battlecruiser and becomes trapped along with it.

==Plot==
While the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] starship ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]'', under the command of Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]], investigates the asteroid-laden sector of space of the final battle between the Menthars and the Promellians, it receives a distress call from a Promellian battlecruiser: Captain Picard directs the ship to investigate. They find the ancient battlecruiser adrift but intact, and Picard, anxious to see the ship for himself, joins the away team as they transport over. They find the crew - all long dead, but still at their posts - while a recording by their captain suggests the ship was caught in a Menthar trap. With their investigation complete, the away team returns to the ''Enterprise'' to continue on, when they begin to suffer a series of power losses that prevent the use of either [[Impulse drive|impulse]] or [[Warp drive (Star Trek)|warp drive]], and are bombarded by radiation that threatens to drain their shields and kill the crew. Picard orders Chief Engineer [[Geordie La Forge|La Forge]] to find a way to restore power while a second away team searches for more clues on the Promellian vessel. They discover that the Menthars had previously used [[aceton assimilators]] to absorb an enemy ship's energy and redirect it back as hazardous radiation, and that the ''Enterprise'' is stuck in the same trap.

La Forge realizes that the only way to restore power is to reconfigure the warp drive and traces the warp drive's design back to the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s construction and blueprints created by Dr. [[Leah Brahms]]. La Forge enters the ship's [[holodeck]] to help figure through the engine reconfiguration, whereupon the computer takes an off the cuff remark by Geordi literally and creates a holographic representation of Brahms herself to assist him in his work. As Geordi does so, he asks the computer to update the hologram with Dr. Brahms' personality profile, and slowly gains romantic feelings for her. Despite the holo-Brahms' help, La Forge is unable to find a way to safely maneuver the ''Enterprise'' away, and when Picard orders all extraneous power systems (including the holodeck) shut down to conserve power, La Forge convinces the captain to allow the holodeck to continue to run.

After power is restored, the simulated Dr. Brahms recognizes a solution which is to allow the computer to take control of the ship, allowing it to make rapid adjustments to compensate for the trap. La Forge then finds an alternate solution to the problem which is to completely reduce the power output from the ''Enterprise'' and maneuver it out of the field by manual control with only two thrusters. Picard and La Forge decide that computers cannot account for human intuition and elect to go with the manual approach. Picard takes the helm himself to skilfully carry out the operation, successfully moving the ''Enterprise'' from the trap. Once free and with power restored, the ''Enterprise'' destroys the Promellian craft to prevent others from falling into the trap.

'''''Busker Alley''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with music and lyrics by the [[Sherman Brothers]] and a book by [[AJ Carothers]], based on the 1938 [[United Kingdom|British]] film, ''[[Sidewalks of London|St. Martin's Lane]]'', which was inspired by the 1905 novel, ''[[Small Town Tyrant]]'', by [[Heinrich Mann]].

In the 1995 touring production, [[Tommy Tune]] played the lead character, "Charlie Baxter", a [[Busking|busker]] in love with another busker, who leaves Charlie to follow her dream of becoming a star.  The musical toured the US in 1995 but did not open on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].

==Background and history==
Brothers [[Robert and Richard Sherman]] had written the scores to several [[Disney]] movies such as ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' and ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''.  In the mid 1960s, Disney staff scriptwriter, [[AJ Carothers]] rediscovered the motion picture ''St. Martin's Lane'' and approached the Sherman brothers with the idea of purchasing the rights to the film and making a stage musical out it.  The Shermans and AJ Carothers did just that in 1969, writing the musical ''Piccadilly''.  But nothing more became of it until 1982 when interest was rekindled, and the project was rewritten and renamed, ''Blow Us a Kiss''.  Still, nothing happened with the property until later in the same decade when interest was again sparked, and [[Tommy Tune]] became attached to the show.

=== 1995 U.S. tour ===
With a major Broadway star behind the project, the show was finally launched in 1995 with yet a new name: ''Busker Alley''.  The musical opened in April 1995 at the Macauley Theatre, [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]] as the start of a 16-city tour.  It starred Tune and Darcie Roberts, [[Brent Barrett]], [[Marcia Lewis]], and The Huber Marionettes.  [[Jeff Calhoun (choreographer)|Jeff Calhoun]] directed and choreographed, and sets were by [[Tony Walton]].&lt;ref name=willis&gt;Willis, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gXB9YVdGK1YC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Louisville,+Kentucky+%22Busker+Alley%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Sq7H0TrEvX&amp;sig=lBuK21acqWJsJacbLEBcKKlG8zU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjngJ2I8__WAhXI5IMKHQLPA50Q6AEIWjAN ''Busker Alley''] ''Theatre World 1995-1996'', Hal Leonard Corporation, 1998, {{ISBN|1557833230}}, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The producers planned to bring the production to Broadway in November 1995 at the [[St. James Theatre]]. Artist [[LeRoy Neiman]] created a 40-foot mural for ''Busker Alley'' on the façade of the theater, and the cast performed a number from the show at the [[49th Tony Awards|1995 Tony Awards]] ceremony. The production had numerous setbacks during the tour as well as two more name changes, including ''Stage Door Charley'' (unilaterally chosen by the producer's wife). The show finished its pre-Broadway tour as ''Buskers''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117904233.html?categoryid=33&amp;cs=1 Review] ''Variety'', June 29, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' reported on September 1, 1995: "Neither show [''Victor, Victoria'' and ''Busker''] received unqualified raves during months-long out-of-town tryouts, but judging from the reviews, the problems on ''Busker,'' in which Mr. Tune plays a street entertainer in prewar London, were more severe. Last month, the show returned to New York to put in the rewrites by Peter Stone, and for a retooling by Mr. Tune, whose associate Jeff Calhoun directed and choreographed the show.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Peter. [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/01/theater/on-stage-and-off.html?pagewanted "On Stage, and Off"] ''The New York Times'', September 1, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Six weeks prior to moving to New York City, Tune broke his foot during one of the performances in [[Tampa]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Peter.

The tour ended on October 8, 1995 in Tampa.&lt;ref name=willis/&gt;

===Subsequent events===
In 2003 AJ Carothers and the Sherman Brothers revised their book and song score, changing the name back to ''Busker Alley''.

[[Image:DaleClose.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Jim Dale]] and [[Glenn Close]] in 2006 performing Busker Alley.]]
On November 13, 2006 the [[York Theatre Company]] presented a one-night-only benefit concert performance of ''Busker Alley'' at the Kaye Playhouse at [[Hunter College]]. [[Jim Dale]] starred as "Charlie Baxter".  [[Glenn Close]] appeared as "Dame Libby St. Albans" framing the show's main plot. (Dale and Close originated the roles of [[P.T. Barnum]] and his wife, Charity Barnum, in ''[[Barnum (musical)|Barnum]]'' in 1980.) Also in the cast were: Jessica Grové, [[George S. Irving]], [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]], Noah Racey, John Bolton, Robert Fitch, [[Anne Rogers]], Michael Lane Trautman, Cristy Candler, Diane Wasnak and Bonzer the dog.  [[Tony Walton]] directed the production, with Lisa Shriver as choreographer.  Aaron Gandy was the conductor, and Mark York the pianist.&lt;ref&gt;News Desk.

On August 25, 2009, the producers announced that they all were leaving the production, and, in a statement said (in part), "We will be returning all of the money to our investors and release all of our sponsors from their obligations."&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.

'''''CBS Children's Film Festival''''' (also known as '''''CBS Children's Hour''''') was a television series of live action films from several countries that were made for children (several of them [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] into [[English language|English]]).  Originally a sporadic series airing on Saturday mornings, Sunday afternoons, or weekday afternoons beginning in February 1967, it became a regularly scheduled program in 1971 on the CBS Saturday-morning lineup, running one hour with some films apparently edited down to fit the time slot. The program was hosted by 1950s television act ''[[Kukla, Fran and Ollie]]'', a.k.a. puppeteer [[Burr Tillstrom]] and actress [[Fran Allison]].

Kukla, Fran and Ollie were dropped from the series in 1977 and the program was renamed ''CBS Saturday Film Festival''.&lt;ref name=tvg&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/cbs-childrens-film-festival/200412/ ''CBS Children's Film Festival''] at [[TV Guide|TVGuide.com]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150906204734/http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/cbs-childrens-film-festival/200412/ Archived] from the original on September 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 CBS canceled the show in favor of the youth-targeted magazine ''[[30 Minutes (CBS TV series)|30 Minutes]]'' which was modeled after its adult sister show ''[[60 Minutes]]''. CBS canceled ''30 Minutes'' in 1982 and brought back ''Saturday Film Festival'' which ran for two seasons until CBS cancelled it for good in 1984.

Perhaps the most famous "episode" of the series was the 1960 British film ''[[Hand in Hand (film)|Hand in Hand]]'', the story of a deep friendship between two elementary school students, one a [[Roman Catholic]] boy and the other a [[Jewish]] girl.

In addition to many [[United States|American]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] films, the series also featured motion pictures from [[Russia]], [[France]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Japan]], [[Sweden]], [[Italy]], [[China]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], and [[Czechoslovakia]], as well as several other countries.

Other films that aired during the series run include the [[Academy Awarding]]-winning French film ''[[The Red Balloon]]''' ''[[Skinny and Fatty]]'' from Japan; ''[[Digby, the Biggest Dog in the World]]'' from Great Britain; ''[[Tillie, the Unhappy Hippopotamus]]'' from Czechoslovakia; and ''[[Mi-Mi, the Lazy Kitten]]'' from China.

Actor [[Ray Bolger]], a star of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', served as narrator for some of the episodes during the show's 1980s run.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

'''''Cities in Motion 2''''' is a 2013 [[business simulation game]] that was developed by [[Colossal Order (video game developer)|Colossal Order]] and published by [[Paradox Interactive]] and is the sequel to the popular mass transit simulation game ''[[Cities in Motion]]''.&lt;ref name="CiM2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.paradoxplaza.com/games/cities-in-motion-2 | title = Cities in Motion 2 | author = Paradox Interactive | date = 14 August 2012 | accessdate = 23 March 2013 | publisher = paradoxplaza.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with its predecessor, the goal of the game is to create efficient public transport systems in different major cities of the world. In this edition, there are several new features that the developers introduced based on community feedback about the previous game, including day/night cycles, rush hours and the ability to create timetables. The additions also include dynamic cities where players' decisions have a notable impact on city growth, and the inclusion of [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and competitive multi-player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.paradoxplaza.com/press/2012/8/paradox-interactive-unveils-cities-in-motion-2 | title        = Paradox Interactive Unveils Cities in Motion 2 | author = Paradox Interactive | date = 14 August 2012 | accessdate = 16 August 2012 | publisher = paradoxplaza.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coon songs''' were a [[Music genre|genre of music]] that presented a [[African-American stereotypes|stereotyped image of black people]]. They were popular in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] from around 1880&lt;ref name="d452"/&gt; to 1920,&lt;ref&gt;Reublin, ''Parlor Songs'', April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; though the earliest such songs date from [[minstrel shows]] as far back as 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard-Brown, Janet; ''Scott Joplin: Composer'';  Chelsea House; New York:  2006.  p.22.  {{ISBN|0-791-092-119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise and fall from popularity==
The first explicitly coon-themed song, published in 1880, may have been "The Dandy Coon's Parade" by [[J.P. Skelley]].&lt;ref name="d452"&gt;Dormon, 452.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other notable early coon songs included "The Coons Are on Parade", "New Coon in Town" (by [[J.S. Putnam]], 1883), "Coon Salvation Army" (by [[Sam Lucas]], 1884), "Coon [[Schottische]]" (by William Dressler, 1884).&lt;ref name="d452"/&gt;

By the mid-1880s, coon songs were a national [[Fad|craze]]; over 600 such songs were published in the 1890s.&lt;ref name="d453"&gt;Dormon, 453.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="l106"&gt;Lemons, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most successful songs sold millions of copies.&lt;ref name="d453"/&gt;  To take advantage of the fad, composers "add[ed] words typical of coon songs to previously published songs and rags".&lt;ref name="reublin"&gt;Reublin &amp; Maine.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Every race has a flag but the coon.jpg|Sheet music to "Every Race Has a Flag But the Coon"|thumb|180px]]
After the turn of the century, coon songs began to receive criticism for their racist content.&lt;ref name="a35"&gt;Abbott, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1905, [[Bob Cole (composer)|Bob Cole]], an African-American composer who had gained fame largely by writing coon songs, made somewhat unprecedented remarks about the genre.&lt;ref name="a35"/&gt; When asked in an interview about the name of his earlier comedy ''[[A Trip to Coontown]]'', he replied, "That day has passed with the softly flowing tide of revelations."&lt;ref name="a35"/&gt; Following further criticism the use of "coon" in song titles greatly decreased after 1910.&lt;ref name="a35"/&gt;

On August 13, 1920, the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]] created the [[Pan-African flag|Red, Black and Green flag]] as a response to the song "[[Every Race Has a Flag but the Coon]]" by [[Will A. Heelan|Heelan]] and [[J. Fred Helf|Helf]]. That song along with "[[Coon, Coon, Coon]]" and "[[All Coons Look Alike to Me]]" were identified by [[H.L. Mencken]] as being the songs which firmly established the derogatory term "coon" in the American vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mencken|first1=H. L.|title=Designations for Colored Folk (1944)|url=http://www.virginia.edu/woodson/courses/aas102%20(spring%2001)/articles/names/mencken.htm|website=www.virginia.edu|accessdate=18 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally in the 1830s, the term had been associated with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].  The Whigs used a raccoon as its emblem, but also had a more tolerant attitude towards blacks than the other political factions.  The latter opinion is likely what transformed the term "coon" from mere political slang into a racial slur.&lt;ref&gt;Sotiroupoulos, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the popularity of coon songs may be explained in part by their historical timing: coon songs arose precisely as the [[popular music]] [[music industry|business]] exploded in [[Tin Pan Alley]].&lt;ref name="d453"/&gt; However, James Dormon, a former professor of history and [[American studies]] at the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette|University of Southwestern Louisiana]], has also suggested that coon songs can be seen as "a necessary sociopsychological mechanism for justifying [[racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] and subordination."&lt;ref name="d466"&gt;Dormon, 466.&lt;/ref&gt;  The songs portrayed Blacks as posing a threat to the American social order, and implied that they had to be controlled.&lt;ref name="d466"/&gt;

==Composers==
[[File:Allcoonslookaliketome.jpg|Sheet music to [[Ernest Hogan]]'s "[[Ernest Hogan#Creation of ragtime genre|All Coons Look Alike to Me]]".|thumb|180px]][[File:Mahoneygal.jpg|Sheet music to "Ma Honey Gal". Coon songs suggested that the most common living arrangement for Blacks was a "honey" relationship (unmarried [[cohabitation]]), rather than marriage.|180px|thumb]]
At the height of their popularity, "just about every songwriter in the country" was writing coon songs "to fill the seemingly insatiable demand".&lt;ref name="reublin"/&gt;  Writers of coon songs included some of the most important [[Tin Pan Alley]] composers, including [[Gus Edwards (songwriter)|Gus Edwards]], [[Fred Fisher]] (who wrote the 1905 "If the Man in the Moon Were a Coon", which sold three million copies),&lt;ref&gt;Lemons, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Irving Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamm, 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even one of [[John Philip Sousa]]'s assistants, [[Arthur Pryor]], composed coon songs.&lt;ref name="reublin"/&gt;  (This was meant to ensure a steady supply to Sousa's band, which performed the songs and popularized several coon song melodies.&lt;ref name="reublin"/&gt;)

Many coon songs were written by whites, but some were written by African-Americans.&lt;ref name="l106"/&gt;  Important black composers of coon songs include [[Ernest Hogan]] (who wrote "[[All Coons Look Alike to Me]]", the most famous coon song);&lt;ref name="d459"&gt;Dormon, 459.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lemons, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Lucas]] (who wrote the most racist early coon songs by modern standards);&lt;ref name="d452"/&gt; minstrel and songwriter Sidney L. Perrin (who wrote "Black Annie," "Dat's De Way to Spell Chicken," "Mamma's Little Pumpkin Colored Coons," "Gib Me Ma 15 cents," and "My Dinah"); [[Bob Cole (composer)|Bob Cole]] (who wrote dozens of songs, including "I Wonder What The Coon's Game Is?" and "No Coons Allowed"); and [[Bert Williams]] and [[George Walker (vaudeville)|George Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;Lemons, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even classic [[ragtime]] composer [[Scott Joplin]] wrote at least one coon song (''I Am Thinking of my Pickaninny Days''), and may have composed the music for several more, using lyrics written by others.&lt;ref&gt;Blesh, Rudi and Harris, Janet; ''They All Played Ragtime''; Alfred P. Knopf;  New York:  1950.;  p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Coon songs almost always aimed to be funny and incorporated the [[syncopated]] rhythms of [[ragtime]] music.&lt;ref name="d453"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dvorak"/&gt;  A coon song's defining characteristic, however, was its [[African-American stereotypes|caricature of African Americans]]. In keeping with the older [[Minstrel show|minstrel]] image of blacks, coon songs often featured "[[Watermelon stereotype|watermelon]]- and chicken-loving rural buffoon[s]".&lt;ref name="d455"&gt;Dormon, 455.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, "blacks began to appear as not only ignorant and indolent, but also devoid of honesty or personal honor, given to drunkenness and gambling, utterly without ambition, sensuous, libidinous, even lascivious."&lt;ref name="d455"/&gt;  Blacks were portrayed as making money through [[gambling]], [[theft]], and [[hustling]], rather than working to earn a living,&lt;ref name="d455"/&gt; as in the Nathan Bivins song "Gimme Ma Money":

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Last night I did go to a big Crap game,
How dem coons did gamble wuz a sin and a shame...
I'm gambling for my Sadie,
Cause she's my lady,
I'm a hustling coon, ... dat's just what I am.&lt;ref name="d456"&gt;Dormon, 456.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coon songs portrayed blacks as "hot", in this context meaning promiscuous and libidinous.  They suggested that the most common living arrangement was a "honey" relationship (unmarried [[cohabitation]]), rather than marriage.&lt;ref name="d458"&gt;Dormon, 458.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blacks were portrayed as inclined toward acts of provocative violence.  [[Straight razor|Razors]] were often featured in the songs and came to symbolize blacks' wanton tendencies.&lt;ref name="d455"/&gt;  However, violence in the songs was uniformly directed at blacks instead of whites (perhaps to discharge the threatening notion of black violence amongst the coon songs' predominantly white consumers).  Hence, the spectre of black-on-white violence remained but an allusion.&lt;ref name="d460"&gt;Dormon, 460.&lt;/ref&gt;  The street-patrolling "[[bullying|bully]] coon" was often used as a stock character in coon songs.&lt;ref&gt;Dormon, 460–461.&lt;/ref&gt;

The songs showed the social threats that whites believed were posed by blacks.  [[Passing (racial identity)|Passing]] was a common theme,&lt;ref&gt;Dormon, 461.&lt;/ref&gt; and blacks were portrayed as seeking the status of whites, through education and money.&lt;ref&gt;Dormon, 462.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, blacks rarely, except during [[dream sequence]]s, actually succeeded at appearing white; they only aspired to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Dormon, 463.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in theater==

Coon songs were popular in [[vaudeville]] theater, where they were delivered by "coon shouters", who were typically White females.&lt;ref name="reublin"/&gt;  Notable coon shouters included [[Artie Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sophie Tucker]], [[May Irwin]], [[Mae West]], [[Fanny Brice]], [[Fay Templeton]], [[Lotta Crabtree]],  [[Marie Dressler]], [[Emma Carus]], [[Nora Bayes]], [[Clarice Vance]], [[Elsie Janis]], [[Trixie Friganza]], [[Eva Tanguay]] and [[Julia Gerity]].&lt;ref name="reublin"/&gt; [[File:Artie Hall.jpg|Portion of sheet music cover to "Jessamine" (c) 1906 Jerome H. Remick &amp; Co. NY, NY. [[Artie Hall]] was killed in the collapse of the Orpheus Theatre at San Francisco during the great earthquake of April 18, 1906 | thumb|180px]]

As with minstrel shows earlier, a whole genre of skits and shows grew up around coon songs, and often coon songs were featured in legitimate theater productions.&lt;ref name="reublin"/&gt;

==Effects on African-American music==
Coon songs contributed to the development and acceptance of authentic [[African-American music]].&lt;ref name="d467"&gt;Dormon, 467.&lt;/ref&gt;  Elements from coon songs were incorporated into turn-of-the-century African American folk songs, as was revealed by [[Howard W. Odum]]'s 1906-1908 [[ethnomusicology]] fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, coon songs lyrics influenced the vocabulary of the [[blues]], culminating with [[Bessie Smith]]'s singing in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="d467"/&gt;

Black songwriters and performers who participated in the creation of coon songs profited commercially, enabling them to go on to develop a new type of [[African American musical theater]] based at least in part on African-American traditions.&lt;ref name="d467"/&gt; Coon songs also contributed to the mainstream acceptance of [[ragtime]] music, paving the way for the acceptance of other African-American music.&lt;ref name="d467"/&gt;  [[Ernest Hogan]], when discussing his "[[Ernest Hogan#Creation of ragtime genre|All Coons Look Alike to Me]]" shortly before his death, commented:
{{quote|(That) song caused a lot of trouble in and out of show business, but it was also good for show business because at the time money was short in all walks of life. With the publication of that song, a new musical rhythm was given to the people. Its popularity grew and it sold like wildfire... That one song opened the way for a lot of colored and white songwriters. Finding the rhythm so great, they stuck to it ... and now you get hit songs without the word 'coon.' ... [Ragtime music] would have been lost to the world if I had not put it on paper.&lt;ref name="Dvorak"&gt;Peress, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In Britain==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
Coon songs became tremendously popular in Britain after the 1880s. The role of racial stereotyping in Britain was different from what it was in America, in that the theatre audiences listening to the song often did not see Black people on a day-to-day basis in their lives.

In Britain, the most important stars to popularize coon songs were [[Eugene Stratton]], [[G. H. Elliott]] and [[G. H. Chirgwin]]. "Coon imitators" singing these songs were a staple part of British music-hall until at least 1920. Initially reserved to male artists; however, a small number of women and children increasingly began to sing coon songs at the beginning of the twentieth century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3060">'''George Tzavellas''', also rendered '''Giorgos Tzavellas''', '''Yiorgos Tzavellas''', or '''Yorgos Javellas''' ({{lang-el|Γιώργος Τζαβέλλας}}, 1916, [[Athens]] – October 18, 1976),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0419485/ | title = Yorgos Javellas  | publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate = 2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Greece|Greek]] film director, screenwriter, and playwright. His filmmaking was particularly influential, with critic [[Georges Sadoul]] considering him "one of the three major postwar Greek directors" (along with [[Michael Cacoyannis]] and [[Nikos Koundouros]]).&lt;ref name=Sadoul&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | article = Tzavellas, Georges | encyclopedia = Dictionary of Film Makers | author = [[Georges Sadoul]] |author2=trans.

Tzavellas wrote at least 26 plays, in addition to writing the scripts for all of his films.&lt;ref name=Sadoul /&gt; Among his notable films are  ''[[Marinos Kontaras]]'' (1948), the drama ''[[O methystakas]]'' (1950), and ''[[Antigone (film)|Antigone]]'' (1961), a cinematic adaptation of the Sophocles tragedy.&lt;ref name=Sadoul /&gt; His adaptation of ''Antigone'' reimagined it in the language of realist cinema, omitting stylized elements of Greek stageplay such as the [[Greek chorus|chorus]], and attempting to convey the same information via setting and dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Kenneth MacKinnon | title = Greek Tragedy Into Film | publisher = Fairleigh Dickinson University Press | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-8386-3301-3 | pages = 72–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 he was a member of the jury at the [[14th Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Berlinale 1964"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1964/04_jury_1964/04_Jury_1964.html |title=Berlinale 1964: Juries |accessdate=2010-02-16 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His masterpiece, however, is the 1955 film ''[[The Counterfeit Coin]]'' (''I kálpiki líra''), a film in four parts, linking the stories of several people through their transactions of a single counterfeit [[Sovereign (British coin)|gold coin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3326">'''Gretl Aicher''' (July 19, 1928 &amp;ndash; March 14, 2012) was the [[Artistic Director]] of the [[Salzburg Marionette Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/General_News/2012-03-19/40307/Puppet_Theatre_boss_Gretl_Aicher_dies |title=Puppet Theatre boss Gretl Aicher dies - General News - Austrian Times Online News - English Newspaper |publisher=Austriantimes.at |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Logan, D, ''Puppetry'', p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Billington, M p.164"&gt;Billington, M, ''Performing Arts: A Guide To Practice And Appreciation'', p.164&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Gretl Aicher took over the position of Artistic Director of the famous Salzburg Marionette Theatre in 1977 on the death of the former director, [[Hermann Aicher]].&lt;ref name="Billington, M p.164"/&gt; With her father she has been linked for a considerable time with the success of the company. Her grandfather, [[Anton Aicher]] founded the company in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, D, ''Puppetry'', p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Currell, D, ''The Complete Book of Puppetry'', p.12&lt;/ref&gt; To mark the 70th birthday of Gretl Aicher and the 85th anniversary of the Salzburg Marionette Theatre, a special exhibition of marionettes was opened at the Salzburg Hohensalzburg Fortress.

Aicher has commented on her last passion with puppetry,

{{Cquote|What, then, is the fascination of life with marionettes? Is it the pleasure of performing? The appeal of mastering an "instrument" to the point of virtuosity? The transformation of one's own self? For me, it is the process of empathising with mind and soul, of feeling at one with music and movement that bring these much loved creatures to life. The marionette makes possible undreamt of effects of dramatic imagination, which can never be achieved on the full-size "human" stage.&lt;ref&gt;''Salzburg Marionetten Theater'', p.5-6&lt;/ref&gt; }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2377">'''Guerrilla Burlesque''' has become a part of [[San Francisco]] [[burlesque]] culture since 2005.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} "Guerrilla Burlesque" occurs when a burlesque act happens spontaneously at a show or when burlesque performers descend upon a show to which they were uninvited, thereby finding their way onto the stage. The term was coined in the summer of 2005 by Cherry Lix,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cherry Lix Burlesque Home |url=http://cherrylix.com/ |website=cherrylix.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206033155/http://cherrylix.com/ |archivedate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a burlesque solo artist based in San Francisco.

The first guerrilla burlesque event was performed with Cherry Lix's suggestion by Diamond Daggers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diamonddaggers.com |title=diamonddaggers.com|work=diamond daggers|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a San Francisco burlesque troupe, at Jim Sweeney's (Kingfish) 2005 birthday party at the [[DNA Lounge]] in San Francisco.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The Kingfish is one of the largest burlesque producers in San Francisco.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} After the troupe was successful with the Kingfish, Daisy Delight suggested that they guerrilla the [[Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence]]'s [[Easter]] [[Picnic]] in the Park, a yearly event in San Francisco's [[Dolores Park]]. Later that fall, four members of Diamond Daggers "guerrillaed" on various street corners in [[the Castro]], a popular gay neighborhood in San Francisco.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In February 2006, Cherry Lix and Daisy Delight started Twilight Vixen Revue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twilightvixen.com |title=The Twilight Vixen Revue|work=twilightvixen.com|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new gay burlesque troupe, and they have continued the guerrilla burlesque tradition, most recently descending upon Miz Margo's birthday party at the DNA Lounge in July 2006.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

This style of burlesque epitomizes the "[[Neo-Burlesque]]" or "new burlesque" style of performance, by taking traditional-styled burlesque performance and aggressively bringing it to unsuspecting, modern crowds.

'''''Happy Days''''' is a play in two acts, written by [[Samuel Beckett]].&lt;ref name="Beckett"&gt;Beckett, S., ''The Grove Centenary Edition'' Vol III Dramatic Works (New York: Grove Press, 2006), pp 279-307. Also: Beckett, S., ''The Complete Dramatic Works'' (London: Faber &amp; Faber Ltd, 2006), pp 135-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winnie, buried to her waist, follows her daily routine and prattles to her husband, Willie, who is largely hidden and taciturn. Her frequent refrain is “Oh this ''is'' a happy day.” Later, in Act II she is buried up to her neck, but continues to talk and remember happier days.

==Plot summary==

===Act I===
Winnie is embedded waist-deep in a low mound under blazing light, with a large black bag beside her. She is awakened by a piercing bell and begins her daily routine with a prayer. Talking incessantly to herself, she brushes her teeth, drinks the last of a bottle of tonic, and puts on her hat. She struggles to read the writing on the toothbrush. She awakens her husband Willie, who is hidden by the mound, and prattles to him. He occasionally responds with headlines from his newspaper, one of which reminds her of her first kiss. They both look at an apparently saucy postcard. Winnie explains that Willie’s listening enables her to go on talking, and is delighted when he responds even briefly to one of her many questions. From her bag she pulls out a revolver, recalls how Willie asked her to take it away from him, and puts it on the ground beside her. She puts up a parasol to protect her from the sun, but it catches fire. She finds a music box in her bag, to which Willie briefly sings. Winnie files her nails and remembers the last people who passed, a Mr. and Mrs. Shower (or perhaps Cooker), who asked what she was doing stuck in the ground. She prepares her bag for the night and instructs Willie on how to crawl backwards into his hole. Winnie wishes that he would come round and live where she could see him better.

===Act II===
Winnie is now embedded up to her neck, still wearing her hat, still with the bag and revolver beside her. She is awakened by the bell, which rings again each time she falls back asleep. She senses that Willie is looking at her but cannot see him, and he does not respond to her calls. She continues to talk, recalling a time when a little girl called Mildred undressed her doll in the nursery at night, but is interrupted by anxiety about Willie and further memories of Mr. and Mrs. Shower. Willie crawls out from behind the mound, smartly dressed, which reminds her of the day he asked her to marry him. She encourages him as he tries to crawl up the mound towards her, and is delighted when he grunts "Win". She sings the music-box tune, a love song.

==Characters==

===Winnie===

{{quote|Winnie is one of those parts, I believe, that actresses will want to play in the way that actors aim at [[Hamlet]]—a 'summit' part.
– Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]&lt;ref&gt;Dame Peggy Ashcroft interviewed by Katharine Worth in Ben-Zvi, L., (Ed.) ''Women in Beckett: Performance and Critical Perspectives'' (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Winnie is a "woman of about fifty", who passes her time between "the bell for waking and the bell for sleep"&lt;ref name="Beckett"/&gt; by following a very exact daily routine. in Act 1, after she methodically removes the items from her bag{{mdash}}a comb, a toothbrush, toothpaste, a bottle of [[patent medicine]], lipstick, a nail file, a [[revolver]] and a [[Musical box|music box]]. The routine is raised to the level of ceremony. Beckett's instructions to [[Billie Whitelaw]] in 1979 emphasize this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The bag is all she has—look at it with affection … From the first you should know how she feels about it … When the bag is at the right height you peer in, see what things are there and then get them out. Peer, take, place. Peer, take, place. You peer more when you pick things up than when you put them down. Everything has its place.&lt;ref&gt;Fehsenfeld, M., "From the Perspective of an Actress/Critic: Ritual Patterns in Beckett’s Happy Days" in Burkman, K. H., (Ed.) ''Myth and Ritual in the Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London and Toronto: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1987), p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the end of the day she carefully collects her possessions{{mdash}}bar the gun{{mdash}}and places them back in the bag. Winnie never plumbs (never dares plumb) the bottom ("The depths in particular, who knows what treasures"),&lt;ref name="Beckett"/&gt; so it is also her hope chest.

The items in her bag also have secondary functions, they serve as ''[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/aide-memoire aides-mémoire]''.  But more, like Krapp’s tapes or [[Lucky (Waiting for Godot)|Lucky’s]] bones they provide her with what Mary Doll describes as "touchstones of [[Existentialism|existential]] meaning".&lt;ref&gt;Doll, M. A., "Walking and Rocking: Ritual Acts in ''Footfalls'' and ''Rockaby''" in Davis, R. J. and Butler, L. St J., (Eds.) ''{{'}}Make Sense Who May': Essays on Samuel Beckett's Later Works'' (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988), p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Winnie's perception of these objects connects her to the memories of specific days and important incidents within them.

Her possessions are all wearing out or running out. At the start of Act I she takes the last swig of her medicine before throwing away the bottle, her toothbrush has hardly any hairs left and the lipstick, to use Beckett's expression, is "visibly ''zu ende''", the parasol is faded with a "mangy fringe" and even her pearl necklace is "more thread than pearls".&lt;ref&gt;Reading University Library MS 1396/4/10, pp. 80–83. Quoted in Pountney, R., ''Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett's Drama'' 1956–1976 (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988), p 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Winnie is the eternal [[Optimism|optimist]]{{mdash}}[[Robert Brustein]] called her a "hopeful futilitarian"&lt;ref&gt;Robert Brustein in ''New Republic'', 2 October 1961, p. 45. Reprinted in Graver, L. and Federman, R. (Eds) ''Samuel Beckett: The Critical Heritage'' (London: Routledge, 1997), p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;{{mdash}}but the available sources of her optimism are being used up and she has to work harder and harder to keep up her positive front which is already wafer-thin when we first meet her. Her effortful optimism is expressed in her carefully precise, self-correcting refrain, "Oh this ''is'' a happy day, this will have been another happy day. After all. So far."&lt;ref name="Beckett"/&gt;

Beckett described her as being "like a bird"&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, R., ''Back to Beckett'' (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1973), p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; and she makes every effort to rise above her predicament but she keeps getting pulled down. She never questions or explains why she finds herself in the predicament she is in, but her dream is that she will "simply float up into the blue … And that perhaps some day the earth will yield and let me go, the pull is so great, yes, crack all round me and let me out."&lt;ref name="Beckett"/&gt;

===Willie===

Willie is a man of "about sixty".&lt;ref name="Beckett"/&gt; In marked contrast to Winnie's [[wikt:loquacity|loquacity]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/loquacity&lt;/ref&gt; the henpecked Willie is [[:wiktionary:laconic|laconic]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/laconic&lt;/ref&gt; to a fault. In the whole of the second act Willie utters only one, barely audible monosyllabic word. Much of his dialogue consists of him reading notices from his paper; his responses to Winnie—when he can be bothered to respond at all—are terse and barely communicative. He functions mainly as something for her to talk at—being used as a [[wikt:stooge|stooge]] by the old [[music hall]] pro that Winnie is—"just to know that in theory you can hear me though in fact you don't is all I need."&lt;ref name="Beckett"/&gt;

He keeps himself out of Winnie's gaze, only occasionally surfacing from his tunnel. His only interest is to bury himself, figuratively, in an old newspaper or erotic picture postcards, or literally, underground in his cave asleep and seemingly unaffected by the bell that jars Winnie.

There is a childlike, if not exactly innocent, quality to him and there are many times in the play one might think Winnie was talking to a young boy rather than a grown man. Winnie also serves as his protector, the custodian of "Brownie" the revolver&lt;ref&gt;Beckett is quite specific when he says revolver. He does not mean a [[John Browning#Products|Browning pistol]]. He is linking its name to a line by the poet [[Robert Browning|Browning]], "not because there is a weapon of that name. If the line was by another poet", he wrote, "the revolver wd. be called by the name of that other poet." – Letter to Alan Schneider, 3 September 1961 in Harmon, M. (Ed.) ''No Author Better Served: The Correspondence of Samuel Beckett &amp; Alan Schneider'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1998), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; she keeps safe from him in case he uses it on himself.

Whereas Beckett aligns Winnie with a bird, albeit one with oil on its feathers, he likens Willie to a "[[turtle]]"&lt;ref&gt;Martha Fehsenfeld in Ben-Zvi, L., (Ed.) ''Women in Beckett: Performance and Critical Perspectives'' (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1992), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; although many of the metaphors in the play associate him with pigs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]n Act I Winnie speaks of envying "the brute beast" only a moment before Willie's "''hairy forearm''" appears above the mound; throughout the play Willie never rises to his feet, but crawls on all fours; and when Winnie notes that the bristles on her toothbrush are "pure ... hog's ... [[seta]]e" Willie gives this comment a sexual dimension by revealing that a hog is a "[[Castration|Castrated]] male swine." In context, this phrase seems to relate to Willie, since various hints are made that he has been metaphorically [[Emasculation|emasculated]] by his domineering wife.&lt;ref&gt;Acheson, J., 'Beckett's ''Happy Days'' and Schopenhaurr' in Halio, J. L. and Siegel, B. (Eds) ''Comparative Literary Dimensions: Essays in Honor of Melvin J. Friedman'' (University of Delaware Press, 2000), p. 95 n. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origin==

Beckett began the play on 8 October 1960&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, J., ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p. 475&lt;/ref&gt; and the English version was completed on 14 May 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, C. R., ''Samuel Beckett'', MacMillan Modern Dramatists (London: MacMillan Education, 1983), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett finished the translation into French by November 1962 but amended the title. In a moment of inspiration, he borrowed the title '''''Oh les beaux jours''''', from [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]]'s poem, "''Colloque sentimental''".&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, J., ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyril Cusack]] claimed that ''Happy Days'' was, by Beckett's own admission, "influenced" by Cusack's wife, Maureen Cusack's request that he "write a happy play" after ''[[Krapp's Last Tape|Krapp]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Cusack stand", ''Magill'' magazine, December 1984, http://politico.ie/archive/cusack-stand&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckett confided to Brenda Bruce what was going through his mind as he sat down to write the play:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He said: "Well I thought that the most dreadful thing that could happen to anybody, would be not to be allowed to sleep so that just as you're dropping off there'd be a 'Dong' and you'd have to keep awake; you’re sinking into the ground alive and it's full of ants;&lt;ref&gt;In the play only a single egg-carrying ant—Winnie uses the archaic term [[Ant#Etymology|emmet]]—finds its way into the text.&lt;/ref&gt; and the sun is shining endlessly day and night and there is not a tree … there’s no shade, nothing, and that bell wakes you up all the time and all you've got is a little parcel of things to see you through life." He was referring to the life of the modern woman. Then he said: "And I thought who would cope with that and go down singing, only a woman."&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Brenda Bruce, 7 April 1994. Quoted in Knowlson, J., ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p. 501&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Happy Days'' was first published by [[Grove Press]] in 1961 followed by [[Faber and Faber|Faber]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="Beckett"/&gt; By this stage in his writing career Beckett was becoming more aware of the importance of revising his work in actual performance and so wrote to Grove Press about ''Happy Days'' on 18 May 1961 to advise them that, "I should prefer the text not to appear in any form before production and not in book form until I have seen some rehearsals in London. I can't be definitive without actual work done in the theatre."&lt;ref&gt;Gontarski, S. E., "Revising Himself: Performance as Text in Samuel Beckett's Theatre" in ''Journal of Modern Literature'', Vol. 22, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==

Winnie is embedded in a "low mound",&lt;ref name="Beckett"/&gt; "the [[Mother Nature|mother earth]] symbol to end all other mother earth symbols".&lt;ref&gt;Brater, E., ‘Intertextuality’ in Oppenheim, L., (Ed.) ''Palgrave Advances in Samuel Beckett Studies'' (London: Palgrave, 2004), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; She lives in a deluge of never-ending light from which there is no escape: even the [[Umbrella|parasol]] she unfolds at one point ignites, leaving her without protection. We learn that she has not always been buried in this way but we never discover how she came to be trapped so.

A number of suggestions have been put forth to explain where the idea for the original imagery originated.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S., ''Trilogy'' (London: Calder Publications, 1994), p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; James Knowlson has suggested images from [[Luis Buñuel]]’s 1928 film, ''[[Un chien andalou]]'' or a photograph by [[Angus McBean]] of [[Frances Day]].

Beckett required the set to have "a maximum of simplicity and [[Symmetry#In aesthetics|symmetry]]" with a "very [[pompier]] [[trompe-l'oeil]] backcloth to represent unbroken plain and sky receding to meet in far distance".&lt;ref name="Beckett"/&gt; "What should characterise [the] whole scene, sky and earth", he wrote, "is a pathetic unsuccessful realism, the kind of tawdriness you get in a 3rd rate [[Musical theatre|musical]] or [[pantomime]], that quality of ''pompier'', laughably earnest bad imitation."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Alan Schneider, 17 August 1961 in Harmon, M. (Ed.) ''No Author Better Served: The Correspondence of Samuel Beckett &amp; Alan Schneider'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1998), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene is reminiscent of a [[Postcard#British seaside postcards|seaside postcard]] &lt;ref&gt;"Madeline Renaud really did go for sand: it was the seaside for her, with sand castles." – Dame Peggy Ashcroft interviewed by [[Katharine Worth]] in Ben-Zvi, L., (Ed.) ''Women in Beckett: Performance and Critical Perspectives'' (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1992), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; with Winnie buried in the sand and Willie with his knotted handkerchief and his [[Boater (hat)|boater]]. The fake backdrop calls to mind also the kind used by photographers that feature a painted body on a sheet of wood with a hole cut out where the head belongs popular at holiday venues. Even the title of the play, "Happy Days", is the kind of expression typically used when reminiscing about these kinds of holidays. Of note is the fact that he worked on the play while in the [[Seaside resort#British seaside resorts|English seaside resort]] of [[Folkestone]] during the two weeks he was obliged to be resident in the area before his marriage to [[Suzanne Deschevaux-Dumesnil|Suzanne]] could officially take place.

The play is also reminiscent of the [[music hall]]. The boater Willie sports at a "[[Rake (character)|rakish]] angle"&lt;ref name="Beckett"/&gt; places his character clearly in the music hall tradition as does his [[formal wear]] in the second half of the play. Historically boaters were fashionable headgear up till about the 1920s at which time [[Sun tanning|sunbathing]] started to become fashionable; prior to this ladies would commonly be seen making use of parasols to protect their white skin from the sun's harmful rays.

==Themes==

This play, with Winnie embedded in the earth and Willie crawling on it, is evidently strange. "Strangeness," Beckett informs us, "was the necessary condition of the play{{mdash}} of Winnie’s plight in the play."&lt;ref&gt;Martha Fehsenfeld, Rehearsal Diary of the 1979 Royal Court Theatre, London production. Quoted in Fehsenfeld, M., ‘From the Perspective of an Actress/Critic: Ritual Patterns in Beckett’s Happy Days’ in Burkman, K. H., (Ed.) ''Myth and Ritual in the Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London and Toronto: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1987), p 54&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Berlin]] rehearsals he said, "In this play you have the combination of the strange and the practical, the mysterious and the factual. This is the [[wikt:crux|crux]] of both the comedy and the tragedy of it."&lt;ref&gt;Hübner, A., ''Samuel Beckett inszeniert Glückliche Tage, Probenprotokoll Von Alfred Hübner'' (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1976). Quoted in Fehsenfeld, M., ‘From the Perspective of an Actress/Critic: Ritual Patterns in Beckett’s Happy Days’ in Burkman, K. H., (Ed.) ''Myth and Ritual in the Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London and Toronto: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1987), p 54&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of "What does it mean?" is voiced in the play by the passer-by Mr Shower (or Cooker). Beckett explained this in a letter to Alan Schneider:

: Shower &amp; Cooker are derived from German "''schauen''" &amp; "''gucken''" (to look). They represent the onlooker (audience) wanting to know the meaning of things.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Alan Schneider, 17 August 1961 in Harmon, M. (Ed.) ''No Author Better Served: The Correspondence of Samuel Beckett &amp; Alan Schneider'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1998), p 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Winnie comments sourly, "Usual drivel". But Mrs Shower provides an oblique answer: "What’s the idea of you, she says, what are you meant to mean?".&lt;ref name="Beckett"/&gt;

The play resists answers. When Kay Boyle asked Beckett why Willie reaches up towards Winnie, he replied:

: The question as to which Willie is ‘after’ – Winnie or the revolver – is like the question in ''[[All That Fall]]'' as to whether Mr Rooney threw the little girl out of the railway-carriage or not. And the answer is the same in both cases – we don’t know, at least I don’t. All that is necessary as far as I’m concerned – technically and otherwise – less too little, more too much – is the ambiguity of motive, established clearly I hope by Winnie, ‘Is it me you’re after, Willie, or is it something else? Is it a kiss you’re after, Willie, or is it something else?’ and by the conspicuousness of revolver requested in the stage-directions at beginning of Act II. To test the doubt was dramatically a chance not to be missed, not be bungled either by resolving it."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett to Kay Boyle, 7 October 1961. Quoted in Knowlson, J., ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 485&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the central metaphor is clear: Winnie is sinking inexorably in the slow [[Sands of time (idiom)|sands of time]] and disappointment.

: In ''Happy Days'' the existential condition of the characters is visualized in the mound tightening around Winnie who is sinking deeper and deeper. The nearer she gets to the end, the slower does Winnie sink, and never does the end come to release her from the pain of being smothered in the mound. What Beckett wants to represent is the endless repetition of dying moments rather than death itself. His characters wish to finish life but the end never comes because the clock becomes slower and slower. There is still time, always.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, R., [http://www.blesok.com.mk/tekst.asp?lang=eng&amp;tekst=402&amp;str=1 ‘The Concept of Time and Space in Beckett's Dramas ''Happy Days'' and ''Waiting for Godot''’] in ''[[Blesok]]'' issue 25, March–April, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-act structure emphasises the passing of time. Act II is bleaker than Act I, and Winnie knows it: "To have been what I always am – and so changed from what I was."&lt;ref name="Beckett"/&gt; By Act II she can no longer imagine any relief, and she can no longer pray, as she did at the play’s start. Although she still intones the phrase ‘happy day’, it no longer triggers her smile."&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, R., ‘The Femme Fatale on Beckett’s Stage’ in Ben-Zvi, L., (Ed.) ''Women in Beckett: Performance and Critical Perspectives'' (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1992), p 166&lt;/ref&gt;

The play, like life, has a strong sexual undercurrent. “In the ''Happy Days'' of 1979, Beckett very particularly played upon the physical attractiveness of [Billie] Whitelaw … Where most Winnies, such as Peggy Ashcroft and [[Irene Worth]], look rather [[matron]]ly, Beckett made Whitelaw’s Winnie into a [[siren (mythology)|siren]], with black, low cut gown, haunting eyes, exaggerated lipstick … a woman, who while not any longer young, still manifests a powerful erotic dimension.”&lt;ref&gt;Simone, R. T., ‘Beckett’s Other Trilogy: ''Not I'', ''[[Footfalls]]'' and ''[[Rockaby]]''’ in Davis, R. J. and Butler, L. St J., (Eds.) ''‘Make Sense Who May’: Essays on Samuel Beckett’s Later Works'' (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988), pp 59,60&lt;/ref&gt; Her memories often have a sexual edge: sitting on Charlie Hunter’s knees; her first kiss; the two balls; an encounter in a [[Shed|toolshed]]; when handed the erotic postcard from Willie, she takes time to examine it before returning it in feigned offense and the story she tells of the small girl Mildred’s (Beckett’s original name for Winnie) sexual curiosity is genuinely disturbing. A [[mouse]], in Freudian terms, is a [[Phallus#In psychoanalysis|phallic symbol]] and Beckett’s protagonists often speak autobiographically in the [[Third-person narrative|third person]]. Also the doll wears a pearl necklet, as does she. It should not be taken from this that the terrified child (assuming the story is figurative) has become the [[Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder|frigid wife]]; she talks knowledgeably about sex and early drafts of the play even show how their sex life has dwindled over the years. It does appear that sexual relations between her and [[wikt:Wikisaurus:penis#Synonyms: Most Commonly Used Slang and Vulgarisms|Willie]] – a common British [[euphemism]] for penis – have been lacking, at least from her perspective:

: There was a time when I could have given you a [[wikt:handjob|hand]] … And then a time before that again when I did give you a hand … You were always in dire need of a hand, Willie.&lt;ref name="Beckett"/&gt;

Perhaps this is why she teases him with her recollection of other men, to bring him out both sexually and imaginatively. The play is full of [[Innuendo|sexual innuendo]]. "And it is sex which is responsible for the contuation of the life that plunges man inevitably into suffering. The sexual innuendos contrast, then, with images of [[Infertility|sterility]] or ‘discreation.’"&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, J. and Pilling, J., ''Frescoes of the Skull'' (London: John Calder, 1979), p 104. The term ‘discreation’ is used by D. Alpaugh of ''All That Fall'' in ‘The Symbolic Structure of Samuel Beckett’s ''All That Fall''’ in ''Modern Drama'', IX, December 1966, p 328&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==

Many of the play’s jokes are plays on language. There is a running joke about the writing on Winnie’s toothbrush. She struggles to read it, starting with “pure”, and progressively seeing more adjectives but not the key noun. Finally learning that it is made of “hog’s setae”, she presses Willie to define “hog”. His definition (“Castrated male swine. Reared for slaughter”) encapsulates his plight. They ignore the more unusual word: “[[seta]]e” are stiff bristles, whose purpose on a worm is to grip the surface and help the worm move without going backwards.

Winnie struggles to recall quotations from the [[classics]] in contrast to Willie’s quotes from the popular press:

: In Beckett’s selection of quotation and oblique references, virtually every historical epoch is represented: pre-Christian [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophies]], the blind religiosity and [[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Christian idealism]] of the [[Middle Ages]], [[Renaissance]] [[Humanism]], eighteenth-century [[Rationalism]] and nineteenth-century [[romanticism]]. The philosophers, literature and religions of [[Western world|Western man]] comprise the fragmented mythology against which Winnie fails and suffers and like a jeweller’s [[Metal leaf|foil]], mythology highlights the suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Gontarski, S., ''Samuel Beckett’s Happy Days: A Manuscript Study'' (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1977), p 73. Quoted in ‘The Ritual of Human Teché in ''Happy Days''’ in Burkman, K. H., (Ed.) ''Myth and Ritual in the Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London and Toronto: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1987), p 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking is Winnie's ''[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]]''; words flow from her in an endless stream. She uses "[[cliché]]s to insulate [herself] from the harshness of existence".&lt;ref&gt;Rabinovitz, R. ‘Samuel Beckett's Revised Aphorisms’ in ''Contemporary Literature'' 36.2 (1995), p 211&lt;/ref&gt; In Beckett’s texts, language conceals the world and provides comfort by insulating the individual. “Language generally in Beckett’s world is not a means of conveying meaning, but a balm for the sores of existence.”&lt;ref&gt;Gontarski S., ''Beckett’s Happy Days: A Manuscript Study'' (Columbus, Ohio: The Ohio State University Libraries, 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

The final song is the [[waltz]] [[duet]], ‘I love you so’ from ''[[The Merry Widow]]''.

==Performance history==

The first production was at the [[Cherry Lane Theatre]], [[New York City]] on 17 September 1961, directed by [[Alan Schneider]] with [[Ruth White (actress)|Ruth White]] as Winnie (for which she won an [[Obie Award|Obie]]) and [[John C. Becher]] as Willie. The first [[London]] production was at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] on 1 November 1962 directed by [[George Devine]] and [[Tony Richardson]] with [[Brenda Bruce]] as Winnie and Peter Duguid as Willie.

When ''Happy Days'' was first performed in London there were disagreements about every aspect of the text and production. Even [[Kenneth Tynan]], one of the saviours of ''[[Waiting for Godot|Godot]]'', felt that ''Happy Days'' was "a [[metaphor]] extended beyond its capacity",&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]]'', 4 November 1962, p 29. Quoted in Graver, L. and Federman, R. (Eds) ''Samuel Beckett: The Critical Heritage'' (London: Routledge, 1997), p 25&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, he admitted Beckett's strange, insinuating power and urged his readers to buy tickets for the play.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Billiewhitelaw.jpg|frame|left|Billie Whitelaw in the BBC television presentation of the production of ''Happy Days'' which was performed at the Royal Court Theatre, London in May 1979. Shown as part of the `In Performance' series.]] --&gt;

More recent revivals on stage have occurred in 2008 at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] in New York City, directed by [[Deborah Warner]] and starring [[Fiona Shaw]] as Winnie and [[Tim Potter]] as Willie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brantley|first=Ben|title=Cast in Stone|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2008/01/11/theater/reviews/11happ.htmll|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014 at the [[Young Vic]], starring [[Juliet Stevenson]], and in New York City ([[The Flea Theater]]) and Pasadena (Boston Court Theatre) in 2015 starring [[Tony Shaloub]] and [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]].

In 2016 The [[Yale Repertory Theatre]] mounted a production with [[Dianne Wiest]] as "Winnie" and [[Jarlath Conroy]] as "Willie", directed by James Bundy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/theater/review-happy-days-an-unsettling-glimpse-into-the-existential-abyss.html&lt;/ref&gt;  That production subsequently transferred to downtown [[Brooklyn]], New York's [[Theatre for a New Audience]] with Wiest and Conroy reprising their roles in April &amp; May 2017.

[[Maxine Peake]] will play the role of Winnie at the [[Royal Exchange Theatre]] in 2018, directed by [[Sarah Frankcom]].

==Film==

The film version of ''Happy Days'' was produced in 2001 as part of the [[Beckett on Film]] project. The film was directed by [[Patricia Rozema]] and starred [[Rosaleen Linehan]] as Winnie.

[[Lord Voldemort]] is tightening his grip on both the wizarding and Muggle worlds, kidnapping [[Ollivander]] from [[Diagon Alley]] and destroying the [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]]. The Malfoy family is disgraced when [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]] is apprehended and sent to [[Azkaban]] for his involvement with the [[Death Eaters]]. Voldemort instead chooses [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] to carry out a secret mission at [[Hogwarts]]. Draco's mother [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]] and aunt [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] seek help from [[Severus Snape]], who claims to have been acting as a mole within the [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]] all along. Snape makes an [[Unbreakable Vow]] with Narcissa to protect Draco and fulfill the assignment if he fails.

[[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], now 16 years old, accompanies [[Albus Dumbledore]] from [[Surbiton]] to the village of Budleigh Babberton to visit former Potions professor [[Horace Slughorn]]. Slughorn, who has been in hiding, agrees to return to teach at Hogwarts. Dumbledore then takes Harry to [[The Burrow (Harry Potter)|The Burrow]], where Harry reunites with his best friends, [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]]. The three visit [[Fred and George|Fred and George Weasley's]] new joke shop at Diagon Alley and see Draco entering [[Knockturn Alley]] with a group of Death Eaters including [[Fenrir Greyback]]. Harry believes Voldemort has made Draco a Death Eater, but Ron and Hermione are sceptical. On the [[Hogwarts Express]], Harry hides in the [[Slytherin]] carriage using his [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Invisibility Cloak)|Invisibility Cloak]], but is  spotted and [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrified]] by Malfoy. Harry is found and saved by [[Luna Lovegood]].

At Hogwarts, Harry and Ron borrow textbooks for Slughorn's Potions class, and Harry is stuck with a copy that turns out to be filled with helpful notes and spells left by the "Half-Blood Prince". Harry uses the book to excel in the class and impresses Slughorn, winning a [[Potions in Harry Potter#Felix Felicis|Liquid Luck potion]]. Ron becomes Keeper of the [[Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch]] team and forms a romantic relationship with [[Lavender Brown (Harry Potter)|Lavender Brown]], upsetting Hermione. Harry consoles Hermione and admits that he now has feelings for Ron's younger sister, [[Ginny Weasley]].

Harry spends the Christmas holidays with the Weasleys. On Christmas Eve, Harry discusses his suspicions about Draco to the Order of the Phoenix. His suspicions are dismissed, but [[Arthur Weasley]] later tells Harry privately that the Malfoys may have been interested in a [[Magical Objects in Harry Potter#Vanishing Cabinet|Vanishing Cabinet]]. Bellatrix and Greyback attack and burn down the Burrow, drawing Harry into a battle. He saves Ginny before the Order arrive and fight off the Death Eaters. At Hogwarts, Dumbledore reveals to Harry that Slughorn possesses a memory of Voldemort that Dumbledore desperately needs. He asks Harry to confront Slughorn and retrieve the real memory, after being given an altered version that made it appear as though Slughorn did not know anything. Harry is unable to convince Slughorn.

After Ron accidentally ingests a [[Potions in Harry Potter#Amortentia|love potion]] intended for Harry, Harry cures him with Slughorn's help. The trio celebrate with [[mead]] that Slughorn had intended to gift to Dumbledore. The mead poisons Ron, and Harry is forced to save his life after Slughorn hesitates. Ron murmurs Hermione's name while recovering in the infirmary, causing Lavender to end their relationship. Harry confronts Draco about the mead and a cursed necklace, and the two duel. Harry uses a curse from the Half-Blood Prince's potion book to severely injure Malfoy, who is rescued and healed by Snape. Fearing the book may be filled with more [[Dark Magic]], Ginny and Harry hide it in the [[Room of Requirement]] and share their first kiss.

Harry decides to use his Liquid Luck potion to convince Slughorn to give up the memory Dumbledore needs. Harry views the memory with Dumbledore and learns that Voldemort wanted information for creating [[Horcrux]]es, magical objects that could contain pieces of a wizard's soul and make them immortal. Dumbledore concludes that Voldemort successfully divided his soul into seven pieces by creating six Horcruxes, two of which have already been destroyed: [[Tom Riddle's diary]] by Harry and [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Marvolo Gaunt's Ring|Marvolo Gaunt's ring]] by him. The two travel to a seaside cave where Harry aids Dumbledore in drinking a potion that hides another Horcrux, [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Salazar Slytherin's Locket|Slytherin's locket]].

A weakened Dumbledore defends them from [[Inferius|Inferi]] and [[apparate]]s back to Hogwarts. Bellatrix, Greyback, and more Death Eaters enter Hogwarts with Draco's help through the Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement that Draco managed to connect to the one he had been working on in Knockturn Alley. Dumbledore instructs Harry to hide and not interfere under any circumstance. Draco arrives in the Astronomy Tower and disarms Dumbledore revealing that he has been chosen by Voldemort to kill the headmaster. Snape arrives, and casts the [[Avada Kedavra|killing curse]] on Dumbledore when Draco is unable to bring himself to do it, killing the Headmaster. He then overpowers Harry and reveals himself as the Half-Blood Prince before escaping.

Harry returns to Hogwarts, where the students, staff, and a few guests mourn Dumbledore's death. He later reveals to Ron and Hermione that the locket Horcrux was a fake. The locket contains a message from "[[Death Eater#Regulus Black|R.A.B.]]", stating that he has stolen the real Horcrux with the intent of destroying it. Rather than returning for their final year at Hogwarts, the three decide to leave and track down the remaining Horcruxes.

===Development===
Before [[David Yates]] was officially chosen to direct the film, many directors had expressed an interest in taking the helm. [[Alfonso Cuarón]], the director of the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|third film]], stated he "would love to have the opportunity" to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewreview.net/article.php?id=912|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214152821/http://www.jewreview.net/article.php?id=912|archivedate=14 December 2007 |title=Alfonso Cuaron To Return To Harry Potter? |date=18 November 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2006 |work=JewReview.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]'' director [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]] declined a spot to direct the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|fifth film]], and was not approached for this one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''Phoenix'' Rising |date=6 April 2007 |work=Entertainment Weekly |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20016352,00.html |last=Daly |first=Steve |accessdate=1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guillermo del Toro]] turned down the chance to direct the film in order to direct ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/harry-potter/5767262/Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-50-facts.html |work=The Telegraph |title=Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: 50 facts |date=2009-07-07 |accessdate=2018-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terry Gilliam]] was Rowling's personal choice to direct ''Philosopher's Stone''. When asked whether he would consider directing a later film, Gilliam said, "Warner Bros. had their chance the first time around, and they blew it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1543143/10132006/story.jhtml |work=MTV |title=Terry Gilliam on Depp, ''Potter'' And The Film He Panhandled To Promote |date=16 October 2006 |accessdate=16 October 2006 |last=Carroll |first=Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Dark Horizons]], Yates said that "I was still working on ''Order of the Phoenix'' when they asked me to do ''Half-Blood Prince''. So they were really delighted with the material that they were seeing while we were in post-production, and the conversations happened before the movie was released, because I had to start pre-production on it while ''Order of the Phoenix'' was being promoted. It was just something they see in the work that they really liked, and responded to."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/features/1448/david-yates-for-harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince |title=Exclusive Interview: David Yates for "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" |publisher=Paul Fischer, Dark Horizons |date= 13 July 2009 |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yates described ''Half-Blood Prince'' as being "a cross between the chills of ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' and the fantastical adventure of ''Goblet of Fire''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/movies/movieextras/top10s/potter-hbp-rumours.php |title=Ten Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince facts |publisher=Virgin Media |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emma Watson considered not returning for the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/735/735556p1.html |title=Hermione Gets Cold Feet |accessdate=20 October 2007 |date=26 September 2006 |publisher=IGN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215032457/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/735/735556p1.html |archivedate=15 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually decided that, "the pluses outweighed the minuses," and could not bear to see anyone else play Hermione. Composer [[Nicholas Hooper]] returned from the last film; he included a reworking of [[John Williams]]'s "[[Hedwig's Theme]]", which has recurred in all scores. Also maintained were [[costume design]]er Jany Temime, [[visual effects]] supervisor Tim Burke, creature and make-up effects designer Nick Dudman, and [[special effect]]s supervisor John Richardson from the third film.&lt;ref name="hbp-casting-complete"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=213122 |title=Casting Is Complete on "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" |date=16 November 2007 |accessdate=16 November 2007 |publisher=[[Warner Bros.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yates and Heyman have noted that some of the events of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' influenced the script of ''Half-Blood Prince''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=21818 |title=Yates and Heyman on Harry Potter 6 |accessdate=7 August 2007 |first=Heather |last=Newgen |date=10 July 2007 |publisher=Comingsoon.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sets===
[[Stuart Craig]], the [[production designer]] of the first five films, stayed on to design all the sets in ''Half-Blood Prince''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith |first=Sean |title=Now, Watch Very Carefully |work=Newsweek |date=17 February 2007 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/68436 |accessdate=11 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several new sets are introduced, including Tom Riddle's Orphanage, Astronomy Tower and the Cave. Craig noted that the film used several CGI sets, noticeably the interior of the Cave where Harry and Dumbledore both go to hunt Horcruxes. The exterior of the cave scene was filmed at the [[Cliffs of Moher]] in the west of Ireland, the only location to be filmed outside of the United Kingdom throughout the film series. The interior of the cave is made up of geometric crystal formations. Craig noted "Apart from the point at which Harry and Dumbledore first arrive and the island formation on which everything inside the cave happens, the set is entirely virtual, designed in the computer. We'd had our first totally virtual set on the last film, so we approached this one with a bit more confidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writingstudio.co.za/page2661.html|title=The Writing Studio|accessdate=12 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501200531/http://www.writingstudio.co.za/page2661.html|archivedate=1 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinematography===
Due to cinematographer [[Bruno Delbonnel]]'s use of de-focussing and soft wipes in the digital grade, Warner Bros. asked director David Yates to add more colours to the film. Yates didn't want to lose the "very European look" of the film, but after retouching the picture, he said, "It's not what you wanted, but we're happy with it." After five minutes of watching the film, the studio were pleased with the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.directors.uk.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=313%3Afeatured&amp;Itemid=21 |title=Q&amp;A with David Yates |work=[[Directors UK]] |date=13 July 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006083154/http://www.directors.uk.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=313:featured&amp;Itemid=21 |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.movies.ie/movies/features/Video_Interview_with_David_Yates |title=Interview with David Yates |publisher=Movies.ie |accessdate=2 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719160935/http://www.movies.ie/movies/features/Video_Interview_with_David_Yates |archivedate=19 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Total Film]]'', Yates said that "the choice of angles, the extreme close-ups, [and] the pacing of the scenes" made the film "incredibly rich".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-3/page:3|title=Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: We go on set for the latest Potter picture (page 3)|work=[[Total Film]]|date=1 April 2009|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The palette and lighting was heavily inspired by the Dutch painter [[Rembrandt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/harry-potter-the-half-blood-prince-david-yates-interview |title=Harry Potter &amp; The Half-Blood Prince – David Yates interview |publisher=IndieLondon |accessdate=4 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Half-Blood Prince'' is the only film in the series to be nominated for the Best Cinematography accolade at the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy Awards]].&lt;ref name="academy awards"/&gt;

One of the major challenges for Delbonnel was lighting the film. In an interview with the Academy, he said, "Some of the sets are there since the very first ''Potter''. How could I light them in a different way? This question brought another one based on the series itself… I thought it would be interesting to have those very intimate stories amidst this very dark mood. As if the school was a dark character. That's when I suggested to go for this (again) dark moody variations of greys. Fortunately David Yates, and the producers liked the idea." In reference to the cave scene Delbonnel said, "I wanted to have some kind of 'dynamism' with the light. I thought it could be interesting and more dramatic if the light was floating, circling above the characters faces: sometimes lighting them, sometimes hiding them in a very random and unpredictable way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oscar.go.com/html/util/question.html?img=Cinematography_HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince|title=Nominations Questionnaire: Bruno Delbonnel|accessdate=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual effects===
Tim Burke and Tim Alexander were the visual effects supervisors for the film. Tim Alexander said that completing the [[Inferius|Inferi]]-attack scene took several months. He said, "It's certainly much bolder and scarier than we imagined that they'd ever go in a 'Potter' movie. Director David Yates was cautious of not making this into a [[zombie]] movie, so we were constantly trying to figure out how not to make these dead people coming up look like zombies. A lot of it came down to their movement – they don't move fast, but they don't move really slow or groan and moan. We ended up going with a very realistic style." He also noted that Inferi are skinnier than zombies, waterlogged and grey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2009/06/harry-potter-countdown-scaring-up-the-inferi.html |title='Harry Potter' countdown: Scaring up the Inferi |work=Los Angeles Times |date=18 June 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About Dumbledore's ring of fire, he noted that the effect would look as if someone sprayed propane and then lit it. He added, "We did a lot of research on molten volcanoes, which have a lot of heat going on but no actual flames, and collected a bunch of other references, including flares that burn underwater, and showed them to the Potter folks." The visual effects team emulated these six fire parameters: heat ripples, smoke, buoyancy, viscosity, opacity, and brightness. Since the whole fire scene was very time consuming, computer graphics artist Chris Horvath spent eight months finding a faster way to conjure flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hart |first=Hugh |url=https://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/magazine/17-07/pl_screen |title=Quest for Fire: Look for Searing FX on the Next Harry Potter |work=Wired  |date=4 January 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postmagazine.com/Publications/Post-Magazine/2009/July-1-2009/COVER-STORY-HARRY-POTTER-AND-THE-HALF-BLOOD-PRIN.aspx |title=Cover Story: 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' |work=Post Magazine |accessdate=1 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening scenes of the Death Eaters' attack on Diagon Alley and London was created by Double Negative, led by VFX Supervisor Paul Franklin.  Double Negative spent six months surveying and documenting the environment around the River Thames and Trafalgar Square to create the swooping views of the city.  Double Negative also contributed the Pensieve sequences, developing complex directed fluid simulations to realise the swirling world of memory and the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dneg.com/news/double_negative_attacks_millenium_bridge_for_harry_potter_and_the_half-blood_prince_199.html|title=Double Negative attacks Millenium Bridge for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|date=4 December 2009|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204141929/http://www.dneg.com/news/double_negative_attacks_millenium_bridge_for_harry_potter_and_the_half-blood_prince_199.html|archivedate=4 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from the book==
&lt;!--Please do not add small unsourced detail--&gt;
While at the middle of the series in length, the film ''Half-Blood Prince'' did add or change events in the literary canon. The book begins with a scene involving the [[Muggle Prime Minister]]. Yates and his crew debated over this scene, as well as the character [[Rufus Scrimgeour]], but gave up the beginning of the movie to events described but not seen in the book.&lt;ref name="IGNdiff"&gt;{{cite web|last=Utichi|first=Joe|title=Half-Blood Prince: What Made the Cut|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/100/1002604p1.html|publisher=IGN|date=10 July 2009|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yates thought it would give the audience a feel for what the Death Eaters were doing if they showed the collapse of the [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]] rather than simply describe it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Utichi|first=Joe|title=David Yates Interview|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/100/1003769p2.html|publisher=IGN|date=15 July 2009|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as was done with the Brockdale Bridge in the book). As with ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]'', the [[Dursleys]] were cut, which Steve Kloves did to "break the pattern".&lt;ref name=IGNdiff /&gt; Further background of Tom Riddle was removed, such as the [[Gaunt family|Gaunts]] because they felt it more important to concentrate on Riddle as a young boy, and an additional action scene at the Burrow was added to keep with the tone of the franchise.&lt;ref name=IGNdiff /&gt; Yates felt that they needed "an injection of jeopardy and danger" and that without it there was too much comedy and lightness.&lt;ref name=DYinterview /&gt; A small battle scene at Hogwarts which happened during the end of the book was cut; Heyman commented that it was removed to "[avoid] repetition" with the forthcoming adaptation of the Battle of Hogwarts in ''Deathly Hallows''.&lt;ref name=IGNdiff /&gt; Dumbledore's funeral was removed as it was believed it did not fit with the rest of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/exclusive-david-heyman-talks-dumbledore-s-funeral-hogwarts-battle-more-update-4-a-59248/ |title=Exclusive: David Heyman talks Dumbledore's funeral, Hogwarts battle &amp; more |accessdate=20 September 2008 |date=19 September 2008 |work=SnitchSeeker}}{{Dubious|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth film was simultaneously released in regular cinemas and IMAX 3D everywhere but the United States, due to a conflicting agreement in which ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'' was given a four-week window by itself in IMAX in that country.

The first review of the film came three weeks before the official release.

He highly praised the performance of Sir Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman and Daniel Radcliffe.

Chris Tilly of [[IGN]] UK commented on the length of the film, saying "while on occasion it drags, the 153-minute run-time never feels too long, thanks in no small part to the astonishing visuals and (largely) marvellous performances," and goes on to say, "This is by far the best-looking of the Potter films thus far," commending the "beautiful" Quidditch match and the "stunning" finale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tilly |first=Chris |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/100/1001519p1.html |title=IGN: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Review |publisher=Movies.ign.com |date=7 July 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dave Golder of [[SFX magazine]] found some aspects of the film to be a disappointment, largely due to the large number of opportunities the director and screenwriter had sacrificed to devote "huge swathes of the film to subplots of Harry and his chums' teenage romances," but nevertheless found the film to be a large enjoyment, praising the performances of Jim Broadbent and Alan Rickman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2009/07/08/film_review_harry_potter_and_the_half_blood_prince/ |title=FILM REVIEW: Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince |publisher=SFX |date=8 July 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Stratton]], of ''Margaret and David at the Movies'', gave the film a 2.5 out of a possible 5 stars, remarking, "For non-readers [of the Harry Potter series] the films are now borderline incomprehensible", and that the film was "a little tedious" and "generally less interesting visually than its predecessors."

Hawkeye was introduced as a reluctant villain in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #57 (September 1964). After two more appearances as a villain in ''Tales of Suspense'' #60 and #64 (December 1964 and April 1965), Hawkeye joins the ranks of the Avengers in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #16 (May 1965). He became a perennial member of the team and has made numerous appearances in all five volumes (Vol. 1 (1963–1996), Vol. 2 (1997), Vol. 3 (1999–2004), Vol. 4 (2010–2013), Vol. 5 (2013–present)), including specials and annuals, as well as in ''[[The Ultimates]]''. However, Hawkeye would be absent from the Avengers - both the team and the series - for nearly a decade starting in early 1973. [[Steve Englehart]], the ''Avengers'' writer at the time of Hawkeye's departure, explained, "When I had Hawkeye quit the Avengers, I liked him, but I wanted to try a different approach, so his leaving fit in with what I was trying to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeAngelo|first=Daniel |date=July 2013|title=The Not-Ready-For-Super-Team Players: A History of the Defenders|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65|page=5 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
'''Clint Barton''' was born in [[Waverly, Iowa]]. At a young age he lost both of his parents in a car accident. After six years in an orphanage, Clint and his brother [[Barney Barton|Barney]] ran away to join the Carson Carnival of Travelling Wonders.&lt;ref name="Hawkeye1"&gt;''Hawkeye'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Clint soon caught the eye of the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]], who took the young boy on as his assistant. Along with the help of [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]], the Swordsman trained Clint to become a master [[Archery|archer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Solo Avengers'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; Clint later found the Swordsman embezzling money from the carnival. Before he could turn his mentor over to the authorities, Clint was beaten and left for dead, allowing the Swordsman to escape town.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #19&lt;/ref&gt; Clint's relationship with his brother Barney and Trick Shot soon deteriorated as well.&lt;ref name="Hawkeye: Blindspot #1"&gt;''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Clint adapted his archery skills to become a star carnival attraction, a master archer called "Hawkeye", otherwise known as "The World's Greatest Marksman". He spent some time as a member of [[Ringmaster (comics)|Tiboldt]]'s Circus,&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye'' Vol.3 #7-8&lt;/ref&gt; before joining the [[Coney Island]] Circus. He witnessed [[Iron Man]] in action and was inspired to become a costumed hero. However, after a misunderstanding on his first outing, Hawkeye was accused of theft and believed to be a criminal. On the run, the naive Hawkeye met the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], a spy for the [[Soviet Union]], with whom he fell in love. Blindly following the Black Widow, Hawkeye aided her attempts to steal technology developed by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. In one of their battles with Iron Man, the Black Widow was seriously injured. Hawkeye rescued her and fled the battle to save her life. But before Hawkeye could take her to a hospital, the Black Widow disappeared. Hawkeye decided to be a "straight-shooter" from then on.&lt;ref&gt;''Tales of Suspense'' #57 (1964), #60 + 64 (Dec. 1964 and Apr. 1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avengers===
Hawkeye later rescues [[Edwin Jarvis]] and his mother from a mugger. In gratitude, Jarvis invites Hawkeye to [[Avengers Mansion]] and stages a confrontation to allow the archer to clear his name and gain the trust of the Avengers.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #2 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkeye is then sponsored by his former enemy Iron Man, who sees that he is serious about becoming a hero. Led by [[Captain America]], Hawkeye joins the team along with [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] to form the second incarnation of the Avengers.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #16 (May 1965)&lt;/ref&gt; Almost straight away, Hawkeye clashes with his fellow Avengers. His romantic intentions towards the Scarlet Witch are met with hostility from her brother, Quicksilver. Hawkeye rebels against Captain America's leadership (due to his past problems with authority figures), but over time comes to respect him as a mentor and a friend.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #55&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] attempted to join the Avengers, Hawkeye warned them of his previous history with the villain.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #19 (Aug. 1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avengers no. 63 (Marvel Comics - 1969).jpg|thumb|180px|left|Clint Barton sheds his Hawkeye identity to be the second [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]] on the cover of ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #63 (April 1969). Art by [[Gene Colan]].]]
Hawkeye enjoys many adventures with the Avengers and proves himself a hero on numerous occasions. However, when his bow breaks during a crucial moment in a battle, Clint decides to adopt a new costume and identity by succeeding [[Hank Pym]] as the new [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #63 (Apr. 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkeye (as Goliath) was later approached by his brother [[Barney Barton|Barney]], who had become a big-time racketeer. Barney had learned of [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]]'s plans to construct an orbiting laser death-ray to extort money from the United States and came to the Avengers for help. The Avengers confronted Egghead and his allies, the Mad Thinker and the Puppet Master. Tragically, Barney died in the ensuing battle.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #64–65 (May–April 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; (It was later revealed that Barney Barton was actually an undercover FBI agent.)&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye'' Vol.3 #6&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after this encounter, Egghead hires the Swordsman to capture Goliath (thinking him to be Hank Pym instead of Clint). Clint defeats and captures both criminals, finding justice for his brother at last. At the conclusion of the [[Kree-Skrull War]] Clint resumes the identity of Hawkeye with a new costume. After several adventures, Hawkeye quits the Avengers after a bitter rift with the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)#Silver Age|Vision]] over the affections of the [[Scarlet Witch]]. Hawkeye returns to his original costume and strikes out on his own.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #109 (Mar. 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time, Hawkeye drifts from one adventure to the next. He attempts to return to the Black Widow and briefly battles her current love, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #99 (May 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkeye later assists the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] against the monster [[Zzzax]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hulk'' #166 (Aug. 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; He then follows the Hulk back to the [[Sanctum Sanctorum|mansion]] of [[Doctor Strange]], where after a skirmish, Hawkeye joins the "non-team" the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] for a short period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steve Englehart]] (w), [[Sal Buscema]] (p), ''Defenders'' #7–10 (Aug.–Nov. 1973), [[New York City|New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]&lt;/ref&gt; He returns briefly to the Avengers to attend the wedding of the Vision and the Scarlet Witch.&lt;ref&gt;''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4 (Jun. 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the [[Two-Gun Kid]] and [[Ghost Rider]], Hawkeye defeats the monster the Manticore.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Shooter]] (w), [[Don Perlin]] (p), ''Ghost Rider'' #27 (December 10, 1977), [[New York City|New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkeye returns to the Avengers when the current members of the team begin to mysteriously disappear.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #172 (Jun. 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining Avengers discover it to be the work of the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] of the [[Elders of the Universe]]. After his teammates were all defeated, Hawkeye single-handedly defeats the Collector,&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #174 (Aug. 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; and joins the team for the final battle against [[Korvac]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #175–177 (Sept.–Nov. 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Hawkeye's victory is dashed when the Avengers' new government liaison [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], limits the roster and replaces him with the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], in an attempt to make the team more "politically acceptable". After initially failing to find work in his civilian identity, Hawkeye gains employment with [[Cross Technological Enterprises]] as the Head of Security. He defends the company against the [[Shi'ar]] villain [[Deathbird]],&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #189 (Nov. 1979)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mister Fear]],&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Team-Up'' #92&lt;/ref&gt; and sabotages a plot by C.T.E. employee Ambrose Connors.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Fanfare'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkeye then returns to Avengers mansion several months later for a brief visit "induced" by the heroine [[Moondragon]]&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #211 (Sep. 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; before rejoining for a sustained period.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #222 (Jul. 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkeye returns to Carson Carnival of Travelling Wonders to aid Marcella Carson, the owner's daughter, against the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]. He defeats the villain with the help of [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #223&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Hawkeye inadvertently avenges the death of his brother. The villain [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]], having been exposed for framing [[Henry Pym]], attempts to shoot Pym but Hawkeye jams the barrel of the weapon with an arrow. The weapon is an energy pistol and explodes, killing Egghead instantly.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #229 (Mar. 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage to Mockingbird===
Returning to work for [[Cross Technological Enterprises]] as Head of Security, Hawkeye meets the former [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Barbara "Bobbi" Morse, also known as the hero [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]. Together, they discover that [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]], cousin of the company's original owner, was hatching a plot to destroy the superhero community via an aggression-inducing sonic weapon. Hawkeye and Mockingbird manage to defeat him (although Hawkeye is rendered 80% [[deaf]] when he uses a sonic arrow to counter Crossfire's weapon) and the two heroes get married shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye'' #1–4&lt;/ref&gt; At the direction of then-Avengers chair the Vision, Hawkeye (now using a [[hearing aid]]) and Mockingbird travel to [[Los Angeles]] to establish a west coast branch of the Avengers, known as the [[West Coast Avengers]].&lt;ref&gt;''West Coast Avengers'' #1–4&lt;/ref&gt; While searching for a base of operations, Hawkeye and Mockingbird battle a vengeful Crossfire, who had recently broken out of prison. They manage to defeat the supervillain, aided by former actress [[Moira Brandon]], who later allows her mansion to become the new Avengers Compound.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers West Coast'' Vol.2 #100&lt;/ref&gt; On one of the West Coast Avengers adventures, when the team was lost in time, Mockingbird was kidnapped by an [[American Old West|Old Western]] hero called Lincoln Slade, the [[Phantom Rider]]. The Phantom Rider drugs Mockingbird, convinces her that they are in love, and forces her to engage in a sexual relationship. Mockingbird soon regains her senses. In the resulting battle between the two, Mockingbird allows the Phantom Rider to fall to his death.&lt;ref&gt;''West Coast Avengers'' Vol.2 #17-23&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, when Mockingbird confesses what she did, Hawkeye is stunned that his wife would allow a man to die instead of facing justice. Their relationship becomes frayed as Mockingbird leaves the West Coast Avengers and separates from Hawkeye.&lt;ref&gt;''West Coast Avengers'' Vol.2 #37&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkeye is challenged to a duel to the death by his former mentor [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]]. Hawkeye reluctantly accepts the challenge and wins. Trick Shot reveals that he is dying of cancer and wants to die honorably in battle. Hawkeye, instead of granting his former mentor's wish, promises to fund his medical care.&lt;ref&gt;''Solo Avengers'' #3-5&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] places a bounty on Hawkeye's right arm, Trick Shot (whose cancer had gone into remission) returns to aid his former pupil. Along with Mockingbird, the two archers defeat an army of supervillains looking to lay claim to the bounty.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Spotlight'' #22-25&lt;/ref&gt; After this altercation with Crossfire, Hawkeye tells Mockingbird that he was wrong to blame her for what happened with the Phantom Rider. The pair soon reconcile.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Spotlight'' #25&lt;/ref&gt; After being shot while confronting criminals, Hawkeye adopts an armoured version of his costume to battle the gangs of [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Spotlight'' #30-35 (May–Oct. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

The West Coast Avengers are then caught in the middle of a supernatural battle between [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Satannish]]. The team are able to defeat the two demons and force them back to their own realms. However, Mephisto retaliates by firing energy blasts at the escaping West Coast Avengers. Mockingbird sacrifices herself to save Hawkeye and dies in her husband's arms.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers West Coast'' Vol.2 #100 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Embittered by Mockingbird's death, Hawkeye leaves the team, which is disbanded almost immediately afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers West Coast'' #102 (Jan. 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkeye isolates himself in the Canadian Rockies to separate himself from the world. He is soon forced to battle the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]]. He manages to defeat [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]], the leader of the Secret Empire, and her hired supervillains, [[Javelynn (comics)|Javelynn]] and his old mentor [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye'' #1–4 (Jan.–Apr. 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkeye returns to the Avengers&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #397 (Apr. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; just prior to the battle with the entity [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], in which the Avengers (including Hawkeye) are apparently killed.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #402 (Sep. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], however, transported them all to a [[pocket universe]] where the heroes led altered lives.&lt;ref&gt;''Heroes Reborn: Avengers'' #1 (Nov. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; The heroes eventually learned the truth and they were returned to their own universe. Hawkeye's hearing was fully restored because, when Franklin Richards recreated the heroes in the new universe, he based them on how he remembered them.&lt;ref&gt;''Heroes Reborn: The Return'' # 1–4 (Nov. 1997–Feb. 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thunderbolts===
Hawkeye remains with the Avengers for numerous adventures. He aids Avenger trainees [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]] and [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] to defeat the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Albino (comics)|Albino]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye: Earth's Mightiest Archer'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkeye later resigns the Avengers to assume leadership of the first generation of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], who had broken away from the influence of [[Baron Helmut Zemo]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #12 (vol. 3, Jan. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkeye trains the team in the fashion of former teammate Captain America, and shapes the team into a cohesive fighting unit. The Thunderbolts take on threats like the [[Masters of Evil]],&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #24&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]],&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #27-30&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #49&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkeye begins a romantic relationship with fellow Thunderbolts member [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], who Hawkeye is proving to be a good influence on.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #30 (Sep. 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Hawkeye and the Thunderbolts travel to Hell to save the soul of Mockingbird. They defeat the demonic [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], but Hawkeye is unable to find his wife.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' Annual 2000&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that his Thunderbolts are given full pardons, Hawkeye allows himself to be arrested in their place. The Thunderbolts' past crimes are erased on the condition that they retire from costumed heroics. The team reluctantly agrees.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #50&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when Hawkeye had gotten out of prison, the team comes back together to defeat Graviton once again. Convinced that they are ready to be heroes in their own right, Hawkeye hands leadership of the Thunderbolts to [[Citizen V]] (whose mind was actually under the control of Baron Helmut Zemo) and leaves the team.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #51–75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and House of M===
Hawkeye joins the Avengers once more, and begins a brief romantic relationship with team member the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #489–503 vol. 3, (Oct. 2003–Nov. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; He also embarks on some solo adventures where he uncovers a plot to steal an ancient artifact in Laos,&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye Vol.3 #1–6''&lt;/ref&gt; and investigates the murder of a former Soviet colonel.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye Vol.3 #7-8''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scarlet Witch]], driven mad by her powers, causes a [[Kree]] warship to appear over the skies of New York. The Avengers, surprised by the appearance of the spacecraft, spring into battle. During the battle, Hawkeye's quiver of arrows is set on fire. Knowing that the explosive arrows were going to blow faster than he could remove them, Hawkeye flies into the engines of the Kree warship, destroying the spacecraft and sacrificing himself to save his teammates.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' Vol.3 #502&lt;/ref&gt; A past version of Hawkeye is also plucked from time by the [[Time Variance Authority]] to serve as a juror in a case involving former Avengers teammate [[She-Hulk]]. She-Hulk tries unsuccessfully to warn Hawkeye as to his future.&lt;ref&gt;''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #2 (Jan. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Scarlet Witch inadvertently [[House of M|alters reality]], Hawkeye is resurrected with no memory of previous events.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christos Gage]] (w), [[Mike Perkins]] (p), ''House of M: Avengers'' #2–5 (Nov. 2007–Feb. 2008), [[New York City|New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]&lt;/ref&gt; When a young mutant named [[Layla Miller]] gives several heroes (including Hawkeye) the ability to remember, he is horrified at the Scarlet Witch's actions. Hawkeye shoots Wanda in the back with an arrow. In retaliation, one of her recreated children wipes Hawkeye from existence, killing him once more. When the Scarlet Witch's reality is eventually undone, Hawkeye is still presumed dead. However, the recently formed [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] find his bow and arrows on the site of the old Avengers Mansion, pinning up an article about his death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Michael Bendis]] (w), [[Oliver Coipel]] (p), ''House of M'' #1–8 (Jun. 2005–Jan. 2006), [[New York City|New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return and New Avengers===
Unknown to the New Avengers, Hawkeye is resurrected once reality was restored. He seeks out [[Doctor Strange]], who offers Hawkeye shelter while he comes to terms with his new life. Against the advice of Dr. Strange, Hawkeye eventually travels to [[Wundagore|Wundagore Mountain]] and finds the [[Scarlet Witch]] living a normal life with no memory of her past and apparently without mutant abilities. The two become intimate and Hawkeye then leaves Wanda to her normal life.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #26 (Jan. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the United States, Hawkeye learns about the assassination of [[Captain America]]. He confronts [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], who then offers Hawkeye the Captain America shield and costume to continue the legacy. Hawkeye is later inspired by the words of [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate Bishop]], whom he met while hiding his identity, and rejects Stark's offer.&lt;ref&gt;''Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America'' #3 (July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkeye returns to see Dr. Strange and meets the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]. The team invites Hawkeye to join the team. Hawkeye accepts, and accompanies the team on a mission to Japan to rescue [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]]. However, leaving behind his Hawkeye identity, Clint Barton takes on the disguise of [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #26-30 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Echo, the original Ronin, later gives Barton her blessing to adopt her old identity.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #33 (Aug. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Clint later meets Kate Bishop again, but this time reveals his true identity, much to Kate's surprise. Impressed with Kate's skill with a bow, and the fact she reminds him of himself at her age, Clint blesses Kate to continue using the Hawkeye codename.&lt;ref&gt;''Young Avengers Presents'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

Clint (as Ronin) was part of the New Avengers team that head to the [[Savage Land]] after a tip from [[Veranke|Spider-Woman]] that a Skrull ship had crash landed there. Emerging from the crashed ship was a selection of heroes claiming to have been abducted, one of which was Mockingbird. Clint believes that she is the real Mockingbird until [[Mister Fantastic]]'s invention proves that the heroes from the Skrull ship were all imposters. Later, after the war for Earth was won, Clint is reunited with the real Mockingbird, who was revealed to have been held captive by the Skrulls for years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Bendis]] (w), [[Leinil Francis Yu]] (p), Mark Morales (i), ''Secret Invasion'' #1–8 (June–Jan. 2008), [[New York City|New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark Reign and Siege===

Clint attempts to help Mockingbird as she tries to adapt to life back on Earth. He accompanies her to Zaragoza, Spain, to battle [[Monica Rappaccini]] and the hordes of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] in an effort to deactivate a "dirty bomb" designed by the evil scientific group. Despite their years apart, Clint and Mockingbird battle with comfort and understanding. They manage to defeat A.I.M. and foil their evil plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim McCann (writer)|Jim McCann]] (w), [[Jo Chen]] (p), [[David Lopez (artist)|David Lopez]] (p), ''New Avengers: The Reunion'' #1–4 (March–June 2009), [[New York City|New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the conclusion of the Skrull war, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] is dissolved and [[Norman Osborn]] is placed in power of national security.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Invasion'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; Osborn creates his own team of [[Dark Avengers|villainous Avengers]] by stealing the costumed identities of previous Avengers. The supervillain assassin [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] joins the team and takes on the mantle of Hawkeye.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Watching the Avengers news coverage on television with the rest of the New Avengers, Clint is stunned to see the events taking place. Clint unmasked himself on network television and publicly denounces [[Norman Osborn]] and his regime.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers #50 (Apr. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He is later elected as the leader of the New Avengers and makes toppling Osborn and the Hood from power his number one priority.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #51 (May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Clint argues that the only way to beat Osborn is to kill him, although the rest of the team disagrees. Clint attempts to storm Avengers Tower single-handedly to achieve his goal. He defeats the Dark Avengers, but is captured and arrested when, after failing to kill Norman Osborn, he is attacked from behind by [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Reign: The List - Avengers'' (Nov. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Clint was imprisoned and tortured at the hands of [[Mentallo]]. He was later freed by his teammates, and apologized for his actions.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers Annual'' #3 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Clint aids [[Bucky Barnes|Captain America]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] as they battle the Red Skull and his henchmen to rescue [[Sharon Carter]] and the time-displaced [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America: Reborn'' #3-6&lt;/ref&gt; Captain America later leads the New Avengers (including Clint) against Norman Osborn's forces as they attempted to lay [[Siege (comics)|siege]] to Asgard.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #62-64 (Apr.-Jun. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heroic Age===
After the events of Siege, Steve Rogers puts together a new team of Avengers. Clint joins the team and returns to his Hawkeye identity&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' vol. 4 #1 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; (although he encourages [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate Bishop]] to keep the Hawkeye identity as well).&lt;ref&gt;''I Am an Avenger'' # 1&lt;/ref&gt; He and Mockingbird are also members of the New Avengers,&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #1&lt;/ref&gt; although Hawkeye later leaves the New Avengers when he receives an Avengers priority call from the main team, claiming that he was only there to spend time with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #5&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkeye aids Mockingbird and her anti-terrorist organization, the [[World Counter-terrorism Agency]]. Together, they thwart [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]]'s illegal arms operation, and encounter Lincoln Slade's descendant, Jaime Slade, who later goes onto become the new [[Phantom Rider]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye &amp; Mockingbird'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Crossfire and the new Phantom Rider team-up to battle the heroes. This feud has its casualties with Mockingbird's mother being severely wounded&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye &amp; Mockingbird'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; and the death of Hamilton Slade,&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye &amp; Mockingbird'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; both at the hands of Crossfire. Hawkeye leaves the W.C.A. after it becomes clear that his relationship with Mockingbird has become too strained. However, he quickly rejoins after being informed by Steve Rogers that a kill list of international spies includes Mockingbird.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye &amp; Mockingbird'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkeye and Mockingbird team up with the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] to take on the mysterious new [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]] and the Dark Ocean Society.&lt;ref&gt;''Widowmaker'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; The new Ronin is later revealed to be Alexei Shostakov, the former [[Red Guardian]] and ex-husband of the Black Widow.&lt;ref&gt;''Widowmaker'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; During the final battle with the new Ronin, Hawkeye receives a strong blow to the head. When the battle is won, he assures Mockingbird and Black Widow that he suffered no ill effects from the blow.&lt;ref&gt;''Widowmaker'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; The blow to the head that Hawkeye received proves to be more serious than first thought. While battling the [[Lethal Legion]] with the Avengers, Hawkeye's aim is shown to be faltering. After the battle, [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Donald Blake]] and [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] examine Hawkeye to discover what is causing it. Their diagnosis is that Hawkeye is steadily losing his sight and will soon go blind. Iron Man provides Hawkeye with technology that should stall the blindness. Later, [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]] arrives at [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] on the brink of death. Trick Shot tells Hawkeye that he was forced to train another archer, one who was as good as Hawkeye, before dying in his arms.&lt;ref name="Hawkeye: Blindspot #1"/&gt; Hawkeye was later ambushed by his brother Barney (who was revealed to have been the one trained by Trick Shot) who now goes by the name Trickshot.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; Barney manages to subdue Hawkeye and bring him to Baron Zemo.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; Baron Zemo had the brothers duel to the death. Hawkeye (despite going blind from a previous injury with the third [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]]) managed to best Trickshot in battle. Before teleporting away, Baron Zemo transferred Trickshot's criminal funds over to the "victor" Hawkeye, then taunted the hero for turning his brother against him. In custody, Trickshot agreed to a bone marrow transplant to save his brother's sight, but only so he could battle Hawkeye again in the future.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shattered Heroes===
[[File:Hawkeye 2012 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Hawkeye displaying his redesigned costume on the cover of ''Hawkeye'' Vol. 4 (2012) #2. Art by [[David Aja]].]]
Following the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, the [[Avengers Academy]] is reopened in [[Palos Verdes]] at the former West Coast Avengers headquarters, where Barton accepts an offer to become a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Academy'' #21 (November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The character receives a new costume in ''Avengers'' vol. 4, #19 (November 2011).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Cullen Bunn]], writer of ''Captain America &amp; Hawkeye'', stated the costume was influenced slightly by ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sunu |first=Steve |date=2012-01-11 |title=Cullen Bunn on "Captain America &amp; Hawkeye" |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=36364 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Hawkeye becomes the leader of the [[Secret Avengers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Avengers'' #22 (February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 [[Matt Fraction#Awards|critically acclaimed]] ''Hawkeye'' vol 4 solo series,&lt;ref&gt;http://ew.com/article/2015/03/02/farewell-bro-how-matt-fractions-hawkeye-changed-marvel-comics/&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on Hawkeye defending an apartment building from the Russian mob with the assistance of Kate and his brother Barney.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye'' vol. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkeye became a member of the New Avengers led by Sunspot at the request of S.H.I.E.L.D., who are suspicious of Sunspot's activities and want Clint to spy on them. However, during a conflict, Hawkeye is fired from S.H.I.E.L.D. due to deciding to side with the New Avengers against them and following Songbird's betrayal of the team as a S.H.I.E.L.D. double agent.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Civil War II===
During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Hawkeye shoots Bruce Banner in the head with an arrow in light of [[Ulysses (comics)|Ulysses]]' vision of a rampaging Hulk standing over the corpses of the dead superheroes. During the Avengers-presided trial, Hawkeye stated that Bruce Banner approached him and asked for Hawkeye to kill him if he ever became Hulk again.&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War II'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; He is acquitted of all charges and his actions heavily divided the superhero community in the Ulysses conflict.&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War II: The Accused'' one-shot (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War II'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupy Avengers===
After Civil War II, Clint starts traveling the country and focuses his efforts towards helping the underprivileged with community based problems in an effort to redeem his actions from the event, beginning with the water supply in Santa Rosa. He eventually gains the aid of the [[Red Wolf (comics)|Red Wolf]] of Earth-51920 to help him fight for those who cannot defend themselves.&lt;ref&gt;''Occupy Avengers'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secret Empire===
After Captain America leads Hydra's takeover of Earth as part of the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Hawkeye is one of the leaders for the few free heroes left on Earth (others are either trapped outside Earth's atmosphere, trapped in New York behind a Darkforce shield, or working with Hydra).&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Empire'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; After Rick Jones is able to send information to the heroes revealing that Captain America has been "brainwashed" by the Cosmic Cube [[Kobik]] to believe that he has been a Hydra agent since childhood, Hawkeye is one of the heroes favoring the idea that they can recover the fragmented cube and use it to restore Rogers to normal, in opposition to the Black Widow's plan to just kill Rogers and stop him.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Empire'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their opposing viewpoints, Hawkeye falls back in love with Black Widow and is devastated by her supposed death at the hands of the evil Steve Rogers.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Empire'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tales of Suspense===
Shortly after Natasha's supposed death, a number of her enemies have been killed off. Hawkeye and Winter Soldier start investigating the trail of bodies left behind to uncover the mysterious assassin and determine if Black Widow is still alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Tales of Suspense'' #100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skills and abilities==
While Hawkeye has no superhuman powers (with the exception of the period when using [[Henry Pym|Pym particles]] to become Goliath), he is at the very peak of human conditioning. He is an exceptional fencer, acrobat and marksman, having been trained from childhood in the circus and by the criminals [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]] and [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne|Swordsman]]. This includes considerable strength, as a supervillain found out when he tried to use the superhero's {{convert|250|lb-f|N|lk=on|abbr=off}} draw-weight bow and found that he could not draw back the string to launch an arrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruenwald|first=Mark|author2=Layton, Bob|title=Till Death Do Us Part|year=1983|volume=1|series=Hawkeye|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkeye has also been thoroughly trained by Captain America in tactics, martial arts, and hand-to-hand combat. Hawkeye excels in the use of ranged weapons, especially the bow and arrow, and carries a quiver containing a number of customized [[Trick arrows#Hawkeye's trick arrows|"trick arrows"]]. In his role as Ronin, Barton shows great proficiency with the [[katana]] and other [[melee]] weapons. He has gained a reputation for being able to "turn any object into a weapon", and has been seen using items such as tin plates, coins, sticks and other debris to great effect against his enemies.

Hawkeye is also known to use a "Sky-Cycle" as his mode of transportation. The Sky-Cycle is modelled after a commercial snowmobile and is fitted with anti-gravitational technology. It is voice-operated and has an auto-pilot steering system. The original Sky-Cycle was custom made for Hawkeye by Jorge Latham while he was employed by [[Cross Technological Enterprises]].&lt;ref name="Hawkeye1"/&gt; Latham was later employed by the [[West Coast Avengers]] and built several more.&lt;ref&gt;''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #1''&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth volume of ''Hawkeye'' has received favorable reviews for its focus on what Hawkeye does when he's not an Avenger, playing up his status as the "[[everyman]]" on the team. Praising the series in an article titled, "How did Hawkeye become Marvel's best comic?", ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote, "Spider-Man has long been considered Marvel's superhero everyman, but Hawkeye has stolen that title with this series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/how-did-ihawkeye-ibecome-marvels-best-comic-89607 |title=How did Hawkeye become Marvel's best comic? |last=Sava |first=Oliver |date=7 Dec 2012 |publisher=''The A.V.

One of the series' most well received issues was the "Pizza Dog" issue (No. 11), which is told from the perspective of Barton's dog, [[Lucky the Pizza Dog|Lucky]]. ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' said of the issue, "The conceit is a high-concept, high-wire act for a comic to carry off, but Fraction and Aja stick the landing with a poise and grace that deserves full marks ... It manages to be both a functional murder mystery loaded with noir sensibilities – from the bloody paw prints that blot across the cover to a rooftop gun scuffle with neighborhood thugs – and a book that is as entertaining as it is experimental and worth reading a time or ten."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2013/06/fraction-hawkeye-pizza-dog/ |title=The Best Superhero Comic of the Year Is About a Crime-Solving Dog Who Loves Pizza |last=Hudson |first=Laura |date=27 June 2013 |publisher=''Wired'' |accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the mother of 4-year-old Anthony Smith contacted [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] because her son would not wear his hearing aid, as superheroes do not have to. Marvel responded with a custom comic book of the superhero [[Blue Ear (comics)|Blue Ear]] for Anthony, and also pointed out that for years Hawkeye was deaf and used hearing aids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxboston.com/story/18597572/2012/05/22/marvel-comics-creates-superhero-in-honor-of-nh-boy |title=Marvel Comics creates superhero in honor of NH boy |publisher=MyFoxBoston |date=2012-05-22 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation''' ({{lang-el|Ελληνική Ραδιοφωνία Τηλεόραση}}, ''Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi'' or '''ERT''' (ΕΡΤ) is the state-owned public radio and television broadcaster for [[Greece]].

==History==
===Overview===
ERT began broadcasting in 1938 as the Radio Broadcasting Service or YRE (Υπηρεσία Ραδιοφωνικής Εκπομπής, ΥΡΕ).

Following a government decision, the original company was abolished on 11 June 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[[#et-b-2013|Government Gazette (11 June 2013)]].&lt;/ref&gt; with its 2,656 employees protesting against the closure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greek public broadcaster ERT to be shut down, reopened with fewer employees|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_11/06/2013_503874|publisher=ekathimerini.com|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing broadcasting via a satellite transmission using [[European Broadcasting Union]] equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/12/ert-shutdown-european-broadcasting-union-makeshift-studio-greece | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Lisa | last=O'Carroll | title=ERT shutdown: European Broadcasting Union sets up makeshift studio | date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EBU also began providing Internet streaming of the ERT broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.ebu.ch/cms/en/sites/ebu/contents/news/2013/06/monitor-ert-online.html Monitor ERT online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612212642/http://www3.ebu.ch/cms/en/sites/ebu/contents/news/2013/06/monitor-ert-online.html |date=12 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June 2013, the Greek government proposed a successor organization,  '''[[New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television]]''' (Νέα Ελληνική Ραδιοφωνία, Ίντερνετ και Τηλεόραση), shortened to [[NERIT]] (ΝΕΡΙΤ),&lt;ref name="Nea ert"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minpress.gr/minpress/nea_ert.pdf |title=Νέα Ελληνική Ραδιοφωνία, Ίντερνετ και Τηλεόραση |trans-title=New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television |date=12 June 2013 |publisher=www.minpress.gr |accessdate=12 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626172912/http://www.minpress.gr/minpress/nea_ert.pdf |archivedate=26 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which launched in August 2013 as "[[Dimosia Tileorasi|Public Television]]" (Δημόσια Τηλεόραση).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.com/2013/06/12/fallout-in-athens-and-brussels-over-greek-tv-shutdown/ Fallout in Athens and Brussels over Greek TV shutdown | euronews, world news&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As protests against the decision of the government (Coalition of New Democracy, PASOK, DIMAR) continued, on 15 June Prime Minister Samaras proposed returning ERT to service immediately, by having an emergency committee rehire selected employees. This offer was rejected by the ERT employees and Samaras' coalition partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/15/greek-pm-climbdown-over-ert-broadcaster | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Helena | last=Smith | title=Greek prime minister backtracks on decision to close public broadcaster | date=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 June 2013, following an appeal by ERT's employees to the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] (Greece's highest administrative court), the Council suspended the government's decision to interrupt broadcasting and shut down ERT's frequencies and ordered the Finance Minister and the minister responsible for media, signing the decision, to take "all necessary organisational measures for the continuation of transmission of broadcasting services and operation of internet websites by a public broadcaster for the period until the establishment and operation of a new operator that will serve the public's interest". In his ruling, the Council's President found that the government's decision violated Law 1730/1987 which requires "the contribution by a public broadcaster to informing, educating and entertaining the Greek people and the diaspora".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ste.gr/portal/page/portal/StE/ProsfatesApofaseis#a268 Temporary Injunction of 17.6.2013 by the President of the Council of State (in Greek)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905025409/http://www.ste.gr/portal/page/portal/StE/ProsfatesApofaseis |date=5 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's appellate division upheld the original Temporary Injunction three days later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ste.gr/portal/page/portal/StE/ProsfatesApofaseis#a269 Decision of 20.6.2013 by the appellate division of the Council of State (in Greek)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905025409/http://www.ste.gr/portal/page/portal/StE/ProsfatesApofaseis |date=5 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 24 October 2013, ERT's employees were able to offer the television programmes of NET (also simulcast in HD as 'ERT-HD') and ET3, and the radio programmes of ERA Athens, ERA Thessaloniki and Third Programme through conventional means (analogue and digital TV, [[FM broadcasting|FM]], medium and shortwave radio broadcasts) as well as over the Internet. At approximately 18:11 [[Greece Summer Time|EEST]], ERT lost their satellite capacity on the [[Astra 23.5°E]] [[Astra 3B]] satellite after successful lobbying by the Greek government to the capacity provider [[SES S.A.]] That halted most conventional TV and radio broadcasts that received the feed from the satellite, but did not affect the regional ERA affiliates that produced their programming locally, nor a large part of [[Athens]] which is served by a [[DVB-T transmitter]] located within the ERT HQs in Ayia Paraskevi. Web streaming wasn't affected at all.&lt;ref name="ERT Sat Withdrawn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ertopen.com/eidiseis/item/7744-h-kybernhsh-katebase-to-doryforiko-shma-ths-ert#.UmlCCFQsG2h |title=Η κυβέρνηση κατέβασε το δορυφορικό σήμα της ΕΡΤ  |trans-title=The Government pulled ERT's satellite signal |date=24 October 2013 |publisher=http://www.ertopen.com |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 24 March 2014, more than nine months after the decision to close down ERT, the striking workers still run 17 radio stations (15 regional, two national) and a single TV channel (ET3), from the regional radio studios, and the ET3 Television Building in [[Thessaloniki]]. FM and AM transmissions continue throughout Greece with some interruptions and [[Shortwave radio|shortwave]] transmissions continue with a weaker transmission power. All radios are also available as webstreams. The TV channel is sporadically transmitted in conventional means (analogue transmitters in Thessaloniki), and is always available as a webstream.

In April 2015, the Hellenic Parliament approved the draft of re-opening ERT S.A. and also voted and approved the draft of re-opening this broadcaster.

As of 11 June 2015, ERT started broadcasting again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.in.gr/culture/article/?aid=1500003967 Ξεκίνησε τη λειτουργία της η ΕΡΤ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1938–2013===
ERT began broadcasting in 1938 as the Radio Broadcasting Service or YRE (Υπηρεσία Ραδιοφωνικής Εκπομπής, ΥΡΕ), initially limited to radio services from [[Athens]], with the [[Athens Radio Station]] based in the [[Zappeion]]. During the [[Axis occupation of Greece]], the service was renamed as the Limited Hellenic Radio Company or AERE (Ανώνυμη Ελληνική Ραδιοφωνική Εταιρεία, ΑΕΡΕ). After Liberation, in 1945 the service was reorganized as the [[National Radio Foundation]] or EIR (Εθνικό Ίδρυμα Ραδιοφωνίας, ΕΙΡ), still based at Zappeion. The radio services were expanded to three national radio services as well as international radio services for emigrant Greeks. EIR was one of 23 founding broadcasting organisations of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] in 1950.

Test television broadcasts began in 1965 and full TV service began in 1966. In 1970, the company was renamed National Radio and Television Foundation or EIRT (Εθνικό Ίδρυμα Ραδιοφωνίας-Τηλεόρασης, ΕΙΡΤ). In 1966, the [[Greek Armed Forces]] began their own TV station, the Armed Forces Television or TED (Τηλεόρασις Ἐνόπλων Δυνάμεων, ΤΕΔ), renamed in 1970 as the [[Armed Forces Information Service]] or YENED (Ὑπηρεσία Ἐνημερώσεως Ἐνόπλων Δυνάμεων, ΥΕΝΕΔ). Television was prominently used as a propaganda medium by the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]]. YENED its name and military orientation until the early 1980s, when it was renamed '''ERT2''' by the then [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] government. On 1 September 1987, a third station was added – [[ET3 (Greece)|ET3]], based in [[Thessaloniki]], with mostly regional programming focused on [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and the rest of [[Voreia Ellada|Northern Greece]].

During the first 20 years of TV services in [[Greece]], ERT broadcasting was limited, starting at around 5{{nbsp}}pm to between midnight and 2{{nbsp}}am. Since 1997 the three ERT TV channels are known as ET1, NET and ET3, and broadcast round the clock. ET1 is an entertainment channel whereas NET is focused on news services. ET3 is still focused on Northern Greece issues, although it broadcasts nationwide.

ERT was a major national sponsor and the official broadcaster of the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic Games]] in Athens. It has been broadcasting the [[Olympic Games]] in Greece since the [[1968 Summer Olympics|Mexico City Games]] of 1968. It also broadcasts [[IAAF]] games while it is shown on privately owned channels mainly in the [[United States]]. Today it broadcasts documentaries, some from the private sector, and a few [[animate]]d shows. With the introduction of independent privately owned channels in Greece in the late 1980s, programme quality changed to a more commercial variety, in order to survive the fierce competition for ratings. This was a major shift in the network's principles that was dominated by wider variety{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}, alleged "higher quality" programmes including documentaries and World Cinema.

On 19 August 2011 the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation announced a planned restructuring of the company; ERT's main channels became [[New Hellenic Television|NET]] and [[ET3 (Greece)|ET3]], while [[ET1 (Greece)|ET1]] was incorporated into the program of NET and ET3. Additionally the digital channels Cine+ and Sport+ ceased broadcasting, and their programming were again incorporated into that of the company's two major domestic channels. [[ERT World]] also saw changes in its programming to reflect the needs of the [[Greek diaspora]] as identified by a survey conducted by ERT. The [[Minister of State (Greece)|Minister of State]] also said that the company would become ''public'' but no longer ''state-owned''.&lt;ref name="Aneksartiti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ert.gr/index.php/eidiseis/ellada/koinwnia/16681-2011-08-19-09-02-38.html |title=Δημόσια και ανεξάρτητη ΕΡΤ |trans-title=A public and independent ERT |date=19 August 2011 |publisher=www.ert.gr |accessdate=19 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926231142/http://www.ert.gr/index.php/eidiseis/ellada/koinwnia/16681-2011-08-19-09-02-38.html |archivedate=26 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Closure===
At 17:45 [[Eastern European Time|EEST]] (UTC+3) on 11 June 2013, the Greek spokesperson, Simos Kedikoglou, announced ERT would close by the end of the day. ERT shutdown caused the loss of 2,500 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/12/ert-shutdown-european-broadcasting-union-makeshift-studio-greece|title=ERT shutdown: European Broadcasting Union sets up makeshift studio|last=O'Carroll|first=Lisa|date=2013-06-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERT was dissolved by a Common Ministerial Decision that was enacted by virtue of Article 14B of Law 3429/2005 (regarding the dissolution, merger and restructuring of public companies) as amended by an urgent government Legislative Ordinace (FEK 139/11.06.2013, Issue A').&lt;ref&gt;Article 44 of the Greek Constitution allows the President following a Cabinet proposal "under extraordinary circumstances of an urgent and unforeseeable need" to issue legislative ordinances which have immediate effect but must be submitted to Parliament within 40 days and ratified within three months following their submission.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite running a budget surplus on income from a license fee outside the state budget, in a televised statement, Simos Kedikoglou, the minister responsible for media and the government's spokesperson, said that the ERT was a "haven of waste" that cost more and had fewer viewers than private stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/state-broadcaster-ert-shut-down-greece|title=Greece shuts down state broadcaster in search for new savings|publisher=Guardian|date=12 June 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the evening, some of ERT workers managed to continue the broadcasting via [[Ustream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/12/greek-journalists-close-state-broadcaster-ert|title=Greek journalists defy government order to close state broadcaster|last=O'Carroll|first=Lisa|date=2013-06-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police forced their way into at least one of the transmitting stations,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} and all ERT transmitters were closed down around Greece, as was eventually the worldwide ERT World feed. Using satellite offices and other spaces that had not been closed down, ERT journalists continued to broadcast to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;http://international.radiobubble.gr/2013/06/the-shutdown-of-ert-live-blog-12-june.html&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest ERT Transmitters to Athens closed at approximately 23:17 local time. 20 seconds later, channel 902TV (the communist party channel) retransmits the ERT signal, although a few minutes later, the Greek government called Digea, the digital television service, to close the signal [902's] due to rebroadcasting the signal without permission, and so 902 was closed for a period of time. This action was deemed unacceptable by the citizens of Greece due to the Government not consulting the National Council of Radio and Television, the official body of Radio and Television in Greece.

On 12 June at noon local time, the AS and IP range of ERT,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} the official domain names "ert.gr", "ert3.gr", and "voiceofgreece.gr" were cancelled in the Greek Internet registry, meaning that live broadcasts on the Internet (ERT LIVE) have stopped, as well as the publication of all news articles. Emails sent to the broadcasters are no longer delivered. Other Internet assets registered by ERT are at risk of being closed (because their owner and contact address are no longer valid), notably the official [[Facebook]] page and [[Twitter]] account. ERT LIVE is relayed by other sites, such as the University of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://university-greece.blogspot.gr/2013/06/live.html ERT LIVE] relayed by the University of Greece, on Blogspot. 12 June 2013.

The European Broadcasting Union was quick to criticise the closure, issuing a statement the same evening where they expressed "profound dismay on behalf of Europe’s entire public service media" and urged the prime minister to reverse the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.ebu.ch/cms/en/sites/ebu/contents/news/2013/06/ebu-urges-greek-government-to-re.html|title=EBU urges Greek government to reverse decision on ERT|publisher=EBU|date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EBU made the ERT stream available on satellite to its members, declaring as well that "to be in the EBU, you must be a broadcaster, and so we will continue keeping ERT on the EBU council" as said by the director, Ingrid Delterne. 

Alexis Tsipras, the leftwing opposition leader, expressed dismay in regards of ERT shutdown and described it as "illegal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/12/greek-journalists-close-state-broadcaster-ert|title=Greek journalists defy government order to close state broadcaster|last=O'Carroll|first=Lisa|date=2013-06-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NERIT===
{{main|New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television}}
On 12 June 2013 a Greek government spokesperson, Simos Kedikoglou, announced the formation of a new public service broadcaster, New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television (NERIT). The company's services were expected to launch on 29 August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.com/2013/06/12/the-next-day-of-ert/ ERT: the day after | euronews, world news&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The service provider was supposed to employ between 1,000 and 1,200 and will continue to be funded by advertising and tax contributions.

ERT is mainly funded by a license fee, paid with the electricity bill (along with other applicable taxes) which represents the vast majority of the resources of the public group. The fee was 4.74 euros per month in 2013, but was reduced to 3 euros per month upon the launch of ERT. It is not connected with actual ownership of a TV set.

There are modest grants from the government for contributing to educational public missions. And since 2008, some commercial resources from advertisers (even though the channels have lost significant parts of audiences) and the economical crisis in Greece has severely impacted the profitability of advertising and of commercial cooperation for the joint production of programs, as well as the collection of license fees on electricity bills.

The opening bars of ''Tsopanakos Imouna'' ({{lang-el|Τσοπανάκος ήμουνα}}) is ERT’s corporate [[theme tune]], as well as their [[interval signal]] on radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kernick|first1=David|title=Greece|url=http://www.intervalsignals.net/countries/greece.htm|website=Interval Signals Online|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERT is the holder of the biggest audiovisual archive in Greece, which includes also significant moments of the modern Greek history.

'''''Hex Frvr''''' (stylized '''''Hex FRVR''''') is a [[puzzle video game]] released in 2015, created by [[indie developer]] Chris Benjaminsen. The player is given an empty hexagon-shaped board, and must strategically place pieces on it to fill in lines of tiles. It started as a test, but unexpectedly went viral after Benjaminsen released it.

== Gameplay ==

The player can choose one of three pieces to add onto an empty board at a time, made up of several small tiles. Linking tiles in a line from one edge of the board to another will remove all the tiles in the completed line, and finishing several lines at once will create a combo for extra points.&lt;ref name=VB&gt;https://venturebeat.com/2015/10/14/meet-hex-frvr-the-new-puzzle-game-thatll-take-over-your-life/&lt;/ref&gt; The game ends when the player can no longer place anymore tiles.&lt;ref name=PCG&gt;https://www.pcgamer.com/hex-frvr-the-perfect-procrastination-puzzle-game/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

''Hex Frvr'' was created by [[Chris Benjaminsen]] as a way to test his [[HTML5]] skills. His first game was a version of [[solitaire]], so he "wanted something different."&lt;ref name=cnet&gt;https://www.cnet.com/news/hex-frvr-set-to-become-the-new-2048/&lt;/ref&gt; The game was based off a [[minigame]] in ''[[Second Life]]''.&lt;ref name=PCG/&gt; According to Chris Benjaminsen, "Quite a lot of my friends started losing sleep to the game, which is a pretty good indicator that you have a success on your hands." He also commented that "the game got even more addictive when sounds and music were added to the game".&lt;ref name=VB/&gt; The game was released on [[Facebook]] and web browsers in August 2015, with the mobile versions releasing 4 October of the same year.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

== Reception ==

When the game's creator Chris Benjaminsen promoted the game on [[Reddit]], it got over 1,500 comments and started to go viral.&lt;ref name=cnet/&gt; According to Benjaminsen, the Reddit post was "definitely what made the game explode. While I have been successful with distribution before, I have never done anything like this."&lt;ref name=VB/&gt; After five days of being released, Chris Benjaminsen revealed that "players have spent just above 4 full years (1,598 days) playing the game".&lt;ref name=cnet/&gt;

Tom Senior wrote an article for [[PC Gamer]] titled "Hex FRVR: the perfect procrastination puzzle game", stating "It's so quick and simple that I can't stop playing it."&lt;ref name=PCG/&gt; The game has been noted by many players to be addictive.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

'''Kota the Triceratops''' is an [[animatronic]] toy [[dinosaur]] made by [[Hasbro]] and [[Playskool]]. It is modeled after a [[triceratops]], and intended for children aged 3 to 6.

The toy debuted at the [[New York City|New York]] Toy Fair in February 2007, building on the reception of Ugobe's earlier [[Pleo]] robotic dinosaur toy, and went on sale in October 2007 for approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]300 as listed by the company website. A review by [[IEEE Spectrum]] indicated that it had 11 sensors over its body to sense touch and pressure, and makes appropriate noises (like roars) or movements (like tail-wagging) in response. It has some functionality to accept a folded "leaf" food and move its jaw and make appropriate chomping noises.

The term '''memorial reconstruction''' refers to the hypothesis that the scripts of some 17th century plays were written down from memory by actors who had played parts in them, and that those transcriptions were published.&lt;ref name="BL"&gt;British Library [http://www.bl.uk/collections/panizzi.html#Memorial ''Publishing Drama in Early Modern Europe''] Retrieved: 10 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is suggested as an explanation for the so-called "[[bad quarto]]" versions of plays, in which the texts differ dramatically from later published versions, or appear to be corrupted or confused.

The theory however is facing growing criticism by a number of scholars for being overly applied, and for being an elaborate theory, yet with little evidence to support it.&lt;ref&gt;Sams, Eric. ''The Real Shakespeare; Retrieving the Early Years''. Meridian. (1995) {{ISBN|0-300-07282-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russ McDonald, ed., ''Shakespeare: An Anthology of Criticism and Theory, 1945-2000'', London, Blackwell, 2004; pp. 308-309.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1623, the preface to the [[First Folio]] of Shakespeare's works specifically marketed its content as correct, in contrast to the garbled texts of "stolen and surreptitious copies" published previously. Memorial reconstruction has been supposed to be one of the ways in which texts were "stolen". Examples of possible memorial reconstructions are [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|early editions]] of Shakespeare, including the second quarto (1598) of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' and the [[Hamlet Q1|1603 first quarto]] of ''[[Hamlet]]''.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt; It has been theorized that the only version to survive of [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'' is a text obtained in this way,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Probes|first=Christine McCall|title=Placing the plays of Christopher Marlowe: Fresh Cultural Contexts|editor=Deats, Sara Munson |editor2=Logan, Robert A|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, England|year=2008|page=149|chapter=Senses, signs, symbols and theological allusion in Marlowe's ''The Massacre at Paris''|isbn=0-7546-6204-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is no persuasive evidence to support this assertion.

The theory has been used to explain the content of some quartos, and also to suggest identities of the actors responsible, on the assumption that they would get their own parts right, along with cue-lines and possibly other lines performed when they were onstage, but would most likely make more errors when reconstructing scenes in which their character was not present. The cast members of an Elizabethan dramatic production had their own parts written out for them, with relevant entrances and cues, but they did not have their own individual copies of the play text as a whole.

The theory has, however, been criticised on various grounds; that it is not based on serious research into the way actors actually remember or misremember lines; that texts may have been "stolen" by other means; and that the so-called "bad" quartos are early or alternative versions of plays that were later revised.

==Theory==
[[File:Merry Wives tp.jpg|thumb|The "bad" quarto of ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'', the first text analysed by using the method.]]
The theory first appeared during the 19th century, and it was more fully defined by [[W. W. Greg]] in 1909, when he analysed the quarto text of ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' by systematically comparing the divergences from the Folio version. He concluded that scenes with the character of the Host are much closer to the Folio version than the other scenes are. He therefore deduced that the actor playing the Host had played a significant role in creating the text of the quarto publication.&lt;ref name = "gab"&gt;Gabriel Egan, "The Rise and Fall of the Theory of Memorial Construction", ''The Struggle for Shakespeare's Text: Twentieth-Century Editorial Theory and Practice'', Cambridge University Press, 21 Oct 2010, p100ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, Henry David Gray analysed the [[Hamlet Q1|first quarto of ''Hamlet'']] using the same method. He concluded that the actor who played Marcellus was responsible for the reconstruction. He explained the fact that the "mousetrap" scene in which Marcellus does not appear was also accurate by suggesting that the same actor must have also played one of the roles in that scene.

Both Gray and Greg argued that hired actors playing minor roles would be more susceptible to bribery, as they had much less to lose, than established actors in the company. They also suggested that an anonymous writer filled out the missing verses.&lt;ref name = "gab"/&gt;

The theory became popular and was used to explain the textual oddities of many Elizabethan and Jacobean plays. There was debate about which plays may have been surreptitiously recorded by shorthand during a performance, which by memorial reconstruction and which by a combination of the two. Shakespeare's contemporary [[Thomas Heywood]] appeared to complain about the former practice when he attacked "mangled" versions of his works "copied only by the ear".&lt;ref&gt;Mowbray Velte, ''The Bourgeois Elements in the Dramas of Thomas Heywood'', Ardent Media, 1966, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shorthand method would be unlikely to involve major differences in accuracy from one scene to the next. [[John Dover Wilson]], for example, argued that the ''Hamlet'' bad quarto was mainly based on a transcript but with additions from the actor playing Marcellus. There was much discussion of the first quarto of ''[[King Lear]]'', leading to the conclusion by some that it was based on a transcript and not an actor's memory, as divergences from the Folio version appeared consistently throughout and were not bunched by scene.&lt;ref name = "gab"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics have argued that memorial reconstruction is not as prevalent as has been presumed (some use the term "memorial reconstruction" loosely to refer to both the supposed methods of illicit reconstruction from both actors and auditors).&lt;ref name = "burt"/&gt; In 1975, Michael Warren argued that the quarto version of King Lear is not a "bad" text but that the later Folio version differed because it was a revised version.&lt;ref name = "burt"&gt;Richard Burt, ''Shakespeare After Mass Media'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2002, p.276.&lt;/ref&gt; Later scholars such as [[James S. Shapiro]] have developed the argument.

Likewise, it has been argued that the quarto of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' was printed from a reduced and simplified version, designed for provincial productions.&lt;ref&gt;David Farley-Hills, "The 'Bad' Quarto of ''Romeo and Juliet''", ''Shakespeare Survey'', Volume 49 edited by Stanley Wells, Cambridge University Press, 28 Nov 2002, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; The argument has also been made for the published version of Marlowe's ''Massacre at Paris'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marlowe-society.org/marlowe/work/massacre/downloads/MarloweSocietyMassacreOverview.pdf The Marlowe Society, ''An Overview of Marlowe's Works: The Massacre at Paris'']&lt;/ref&gt; and the first quarto of ''Hamlet''.

In 1996, Laurie Maguire of the Department of English at the University of Ottawa published a study&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, L. ''Shakespeare's Suspect Texts: the 'Bad' Quartos and their context'' Cambridge Univ Press (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; of the concept of memorial reconstruction, based on the analysis of errors made by actors taking part in the BBC TV Shakespeare series, broadcast in the early 1980s. She found that actors typically add, drop or invert single words. However, the larger-scale errors, which would be expected if actors were attempting to piece together the plays some time after their performance, failed to appear in most of the bad quartos. The study, however, uncovered some [[circumstantial evidence]] for memorial reconstruction in the bad quartos of ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' and ''[[Pericles]]''. According to Maguire, virtually all the bad quartos appear to be accurate renditions of original texts that "merit our attention as valid texts in their own right".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Sunday Telegraph'' 17 March 1996 p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of memorial reconstruction has since been questioned by other scholars. In ''Shakespeare: An Anthology of Criticism and Theory, 1945-2000'', Paul Werstine asserts that the theory has "yet to be empirically validated with reference to any extant Shakespeare quarto" and that "there is no documentary evidence that any actor ever memorially reconstructed a play".&lt;ref&gt;Russ McDonald, ed., ''Shakespeare: An Anthology of Criticism and Theory, 1945-2000'', London, Blackwell, 2004; pp. 308-309.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberty Freillerat, in ''The Composition of Shakespeare’s Plays'', suggests that "it is odd that all actor-reporters should make similar mistakes and report inconsistently" and he concludes that the theory of memorial reconstruction is "as disappointing as that of stenographic reconstruction".&lt;ref&gt;Alberty Freillerat, ''The Composition of Shakespeare’s Plays'', New Haven, Yale University Press, 1953; pp. 40-43, 52-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The National Day of Listening''' is an [[List of unofficial observances by date|unofficial day of observance]] where Americans are encouraged to set aside time to record the stories of their families, friends, and local communities. It was first launched by the national oral history project [[StoryCorps]] in 2008 and now recurs on the Friday after [[Thanksgiving Day]], when families are more likely to spend time together. It was proposed as an alternative to "[[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]", a day many businesses see as a high volume pre-Christmas sale day.

Tens of thousands of Americans interviewed one another as part of the National Day of Listening in 2008 [http://www.storycorps.org/national-day-of-listening/press], including President [[George W. Bush]] and his wife [[Laura Bush|Laura]], who were interviewed by President Bush's sister [[Dorothy Bush Koch]].[https://www.npr.org/about/press/2008/112408.NationalDayListening.html][https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/11/20081128.html] National Public Radio personalities including [[Scott Simon]], [[Liane Hansen]], [[Steve Inskeep]], [[Renée Montagne]], [[Frank Deford]], [[Susan Stamberg]], and [[Noah Adams]] also conducted National Day of Listening interviews and broadcast them on the air. [https://www.npr.org/multimedia/2008/11/ndol/ndol.html][http://www.radioworld.com/article/70596][http://www.kgou.org/newsletter_nov08vol1.php]

There are no restrictions on who may conduct an interview as part of the National Day of Listening or what type of interview format may be used. [[StoryCorps]] provides [http://www.storycorps.org/diy/ Do-It-Yourself Resources] and [http://www.storycorps.org/national-day-of-listening/equipment-recommendations equipment recommendations] to guide people through the interview process. guides are available to help teachers and librarians to incorporate The National Day of Listening into the classroom and library.

[[StoryCorps]] is a national nonprofit organization modeled after the [[Federal Writers' Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration]] of the 1930s.[http://www.newsweek.com/id/183675/page/1] In addition to collecting and archiving interviews at the [[American Folklife Center]] at the Library of Congress, StoryCorps helps Americans engage with [[oral history|oral histories]] at the grassroots level. [https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-11-27-oralhistory_N.htm]

[[StoryCorps]]' first book, ''Listening Is an Act of Love: A Celebration of American Life from the StoryCorps Project'', was released in 2007.

'''''Once Upon a Time in Shaolin''''' is a [[double album]] by the [[New York City|New York]] [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Wu-Tang Clan]] that was limited to a single copy sold in 2015. It is the most expensive single album ever sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2015/11/24/new-details-emerge-on-wu-tang-clan-secret-album-sale/|title=New Details Emerge On Wu-Tang Clan Secret Album Sale|first=Zack O'Malley|last=Greenburg|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One double-CD of the album, which was recorded in secret over six years, was pressed in 2014 and stored in a secured vault at the Royal Mansour Hotel in [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]]. The album was auctioned to the highest bidder through auction house [[Paddle8]] in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tshepo Mokoena |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/08/wu-tang-clan-once-upon-time-shaolin-auction-paddle8 |title=Wu-Tang Clan: unique copy of album will be sold by online auction |work=The Guardian |date=January 8, 2015 |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was subsequently revealed the winning bid of $2 million was placed by American businessman [[Martin Shkreli]].  A legal agreement with the purchaser states the album cannot be commercially exploited until 2103, although it can be released for free or played during listening parties.&lt;ref name="musictimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/30821/20150306/wu-tang-clan-statement-once-upon-time-shaolin-release.htm |title=Wu-Tang Clan Issue Statement to Clarify 'Once Upon a Time in Shaolin' Release |work=Music Times |author=Shawn Christ|date=March 6, 2015 |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been argued by some artists involved with the project that producer Cilvaringz misrepresented to some affiliates of the group what they were contributing their work to and that it is not a true Wu-Tang Clan album, but rather a con job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-martin-shkreli-wu-tang-album-20170914-story.html|title=Did Martin Shkreli pay $2 million for a fake Wu-Tang Clan album?|last=Leonard|first=Devin|date=September 14, 2017|website=Chicago Tribune|access-date=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wu-Tang Clan founder [[RZA]] however quickly discredited the accusations by tweeting "It's funny to hear 2 journalists, 2 managers &amp; 2 of my students think they can define a 'real' Wu-Tang Clan album better than the founder???" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RZA/status/909874638963933187|title=RZA Discredits Wu-Tang Album Fraud|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shkreli shared the intro and part of two tracks after threatening to destroy the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Lars Brandle |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6858388/martin-shkreli-destroy-leaving-wu-tang-clan-shaolin-album |title=Martin Shkreli Considers Destroying or Leaving Wu-Tang Clan's 'Shaolin' in a Remote Place |work=Billboard |date=January 28, 2016 |accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 Shkreli allegedly livestreamed a portion of the album to [[YouTube]] after a verdict was reached in a criminal case against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Saul |first=Emily |date=August 4, 2017 |title='Pharma Bro' plays $2M Wu-Tang Clan album to celebrate verdict |url=https://nypost.com/2017/08/04/pharma-bro-plays-2m-wu-tang-clan-album-to-celebrate-verdict/ |work=New York Post |location=New York |access-date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, 2017, Shkreli placed the album up for auction via [[eBay]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/Wu-Tang-Clan-Once-Upon-A-Time-In-Shaolin-Rare-CD/132319745117 |title=Wu-Tang Clan - Once Upon A Time In Shaolin - Rare CD! |date=September 15, 2017 |website=[[EBay]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120005440/https://www.ebay.com/itm/Wu-Tang-Clan-Once-Upon-A-Time-In-Shaolin-Rare-CD/132319745117 |archive-date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it received 343 bids, with a winning bid of $1,025,100 USD. However, the sale was never completed, and in March 2018, the album was ordered by a judge to be forfeited as a result of the seizure of Shkreli's assets following his conviction for securities fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/06/martin-shkreli-wu-tang-clan-album-shaolin-seized-federal-court|title=Martin Shkreli's $2m Wu-Tang Clan album seized by federal court|last=Beaumont-Thomas|first=Ben|date=March 6, 2018|website=the Guardian|access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[Wu-Tang Clan]] producer [[Cilvaringz]] conceived the idea of a musical work in a single form based on music exploitation as a commissioned commodity in the [[Baroque]], [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Renaissance]] ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrx-K8u7xu8|title=Forbes Asks Cilvaringz How The Idea For One Copy Conceptualized|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was developed with Wu-Tang de facto leader [[RZA]] into a concept presentable to the public. The album reportedly features singer [[Cher]] as a guest on two of the album's tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/62262-wu-tang-clans-one-of-a-kind-album-once-upon-a-time-in-shaolin-has-been-sold/|title=Wu-Tang Clan's One-of-a-Kind Album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin Has Been Sold|author=Evan Minsker|work=Pitchfork|date=November 24, 2015|accessdate=December 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was auctioned through auction house [[Paddle8]] in 2015. A winning bid for the album was accepted on May 3, 2015, followed by months of legal diligence. Due to the unprecedented nature of the sale, new and unique legal structures were written for the sales agreement. The sale was completed on August 26, 2015, at a price "in the millions" to a "private American collector".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2015/11/24/wu-tang-clan-secret-album-sold-by-paddle8-but-to-whom/|title=Wu-Tang Clan Secret Album Sold By Paddle8, But To Whom?|author=Zack O'Malley Greenburg|work=Forbes|date=November 24, 2015|accessdate=December 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 9, 2015, ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' identified the buyer as Turing pharmaceutical CEO [[Martin Shkreli]].&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-martin-shkreli-wu-tang-clan-album/|title=Who Bought The Most Expensive Album Ever Made?|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date=December 9, 2015|last1=Leonard|first1=David|last2=Hordern|first2=Annmarie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual sale price was not revealed, but Bloomberg reported&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; and Shkreli confirmed that he had purchased the album for $2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hiphopdx.com/interviews/id.2825|title=Martin Shkreli Plans To Bail-Out Bobby Shmurda|author=Justin Hunte|date=December 16, 2015|work=[[HipHopDX]]|accessdate=December 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement emailed to Bloomberg, RZA said that the sale had been agreed upon before Shkreli's controversial price hike of [[Daraprim]], an anti-infective agent most commonly used in immunocompromised patients with [[toxoplasmosis]]. RZA added that the group had donated a "significant portion" of the proceeds to charity upon learning who the buyer was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-martin-shkreli-wu-tang-clan-album|title=Pharma’s Bad Boy Exec Paid $2 Million for Wu-Tang Clan’s New Record|author1=Devin Leonard|author2=Annmarie Hordern|journal=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=December 9, 2015|accessdate=December 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the charities Wu-Tang Clan donated to were the Children's Literacy Society, the Hip Hop Chess Federation and TTAC, an institution focused on showcasing [[Alternative medicine|alternative cures]] for cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CUrFJIxWEAAcpKt.jpg|title=TTAC Confirms Donation Wu-Tang Clan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
[[file:Wu-Tang Clan - Once Upon A Time In Shaolin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ornate casing for the album]]
Many fans reacted negatively to the news of the single-copy album, believing the album would not be available to the public until 2103. Wu-Tang member [[Method Man]] spoke out against the 88-year commercial ban, blaming fellow member RZA and producer Cilvaringz. RZA replied that the 88-year ban was necessary to maintain the integrity of the album as a work of art and to deflect any notions of a grand marketing or [[publicity stunt]]. According to him, the number 8 bears symbolic significance because there were eight original members of the Wu-Tang Clan, the numbers of the year 2015 add up to eight, Paddle8 has eight in its name, and a rotated eight is the symbol for [[infinity]], which was used on their second album ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=George Palathingal |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/wutang-clans-method-man-slams-stupid-release-plan-for-once-upon-a-time-in-shaolin-20150306-13wtxk.html |title=Wu-Tang Clan's Method Man slams 'stupid' release plan for Once Upon a Time in Shaolin |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=February 20, 2014 |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wu-Tang later released an official statement saying that, although the music may not be sold to the public until 2103, the owner may exhibit or distribute the music for free.&lt;ref name="musictimes1"/&gt;

The ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' certified ''Once Upon a Time in Shaolin'' as the most valuable album in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Guinness World Records]]|title=Guinness World Records 2016|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1910561027|pages=187|date=September 1, 2015|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NuFfCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA187|accessdate=November 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; surpassing records by [[Elvis Presley]] and the [[The Quarrymen|Quarrymen]] (later the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]). On March 3, 2015, the album was detained at [[JFK Airport]] for three hours while border control determined the contents of its box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker |first=Soren |url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.32842 |title=Wu-Tang Clan's 'Once Upon A Time In Shaolin' Album Seized At Airport |work=HipHopDX |date=March 6, 2015 |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, artist Jason Koza sued RZA, Cilvaringz, Paddle8 and Shkreli in the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]] for the alleged unauthorized use of his artwork on the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gardner |first1=Eriq |title=Wu-Tang Clan's $2 Million Album a Target in Copyright Lawsuit |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/wu-tang-clans-2-million-863413 |accessdate=February 10, 2016 |work=Hollywood Reporter |date=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Koza_v_Diggs_et_al_Docket_No_116cv00956_SDNY_Feb_09_2016_Court_Do?1455149569 |title=Koza v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1307">'''Progress Film''' was an East German [[film distribution company]]. Progress was established to handle the release of films produced by [[DEFA]], the state-controlled production outfit of [[Communist]] [[East Germany]]. Like DEFA, Progress Film was a [[monopoly]] company and its films were carefully vetted by the regime for their content. Progress took over this role in the early 1950s from [[Sovexport]], a Soviet-controlled company which operated during the period following the [[Battle of Berlin]] in 1945 and the [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied Occupation]] of Germany.

Progress also distributed foreign film imports, particularly those from other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. In 1950 the company handled the release of the [[Stalinist]] epic ''[[The Fall of Berlin (film)|The Fall of Berlin]]'' in East Germany.

After [[German reunification]], DEFA ceased producing films and Progress fell into abeyance. However it enjoyed a revival as many of the former East German films were re-released and became cult classics.&lt;ref&gt;Heiduschke p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:RTF1959.svg|200px|right|thumb|Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française second logo, used between 1959 and 1964]]
'''Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française''' ('''RTF''' – ''French Radio and Television Broadcasting'') was the French national [[public broadcasting]] organization established on 9 February 1949 to replace the post-war [[Radiodiffusion Française|"''Radiodiffusion Française''" (RDF)]], which had been founded on 23 March 1945 to replace [[Radiodiffusion Nationale (France)|''Radiodiffusion Nationale'' (RN)]], created on 29 July 1939. It was replaced in its turn, on 26 June 1964, by the notionally less-strictly government controlled [[Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française]] (ORTF), which itself lasted until the end of 1974.

RTF was both state-owned and state-controlled. With a budget set by the [[French National Assembly]] under the direction of the [[Ministry of Information (France)|Ministry of Information]], all of its spending and investment plans had to be directly agreed by the Minister of Information and the [[Minister of Finance]].

[[Alain Peyrefitte]], Minister of Information, speaking in a debate in the National Assembly on 26 May 1964,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.assemblee-nationale.fr/2/cri/1963-1964-ordinaire2/027.pdf French National Assembly archives]&lt;/ref&gt; described RTF as "the government in every Frenchman's dining-room" – ''La RTF, c'est le gouvernement dans la salle à manger de chaque Français''.

==History==
A public monopoly on broadcasting in France had been established with the formation of Radiodiffusion Française (RDF) in 1945. RDF was renamed "Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française" (RTF) in 1949 and ORTF in 1964. 
From the beginning, the public broadcaster experienced fierce competition from the "peripheral stations": French-speaking stations aimed at the French public but transmitting on [[longwave]] from neighbouring countries, such as [[Radio Monte Carlo]] (RMC) from [[Monaco]], [[Radio Luxembourg (French)|Radio Luxembourg]] (later [[RTL Group|RTL]]) from [[Luxembourg]], and [[Europe 1]] from Germany (exceptionally, in 1974, RMC was allowed to set up a transmitter on French territory).

==Offices==
RTF's head offices were located in the avenue de Friedland in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris]]. Its television studios and technical buildings were at 13–15 rue Cognacq-Jay.

==Channels==
By the start of the 1960s, the RTF had established five radio and two television channels:

===Radio===
*France I (later [[France Inter]]) on [[long wave]]
*France II (regional programmes, closed on 8 December 1963 and replaced by ''Inter Variétés'' – a variation of ''France Inter'' for older listeners) on high-power [[medium-wave]] transmitters
*France III (later [[France Culture]]) on low-power medium-wave transmitters
*France IV (later [[France Musique]]) on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] only
*France V (formerly Radio Alger, a name which it was to resume on 5 July 1962 when it ceased to be part of RTF following the independence of [[Algeria]])

===Television===
*''La première chaîne'' ("The First Channel"), broadcast in black and white from 25 July 1948 on VHF [[819 line]]s, and until 3 January 1956 on [[441 lines]]. For a period, experimental 625-line transmissions (test cards) in colour using the French [[SECAM]] system (see below) were made on the channel's VHF network each Tuesday morning. 
*''La deuxième chaîne'' ("The Second Channel"), created on 21 December 1963 and broadcast on UHF 625 lines, initially in black and white only. Colour transmissions in [[SECAM]] were introduced (on this channel only) on 1 October 1967.
 
====Regional television====
Regional television, for areas outside Paris, was slow to develop compared with the situation in the United States of America and the United Kingdom.

The first regional station, known as Télé-Lille, began broadcasting on 10 April 1950 with two hours a day of programming for [[Lille]] and its surrounding area. The station's main news programme was called ''Images du Nord'' ("Images of the North"). Télé-Lille's signal did not stop at the country's borders, with the result that the station had five times more viewers in the Belgian provinces of [[West Flanders]], [[East Flanders]], and [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] than it had in northern France. By February 1952, the establishment of a co-axial link with the RTF's studios in Paris meant that Télé-Lille, when not televising its own programmes, could relay RTF's main Paris-originated programming.

In an attempt to counter the spread in [[Alsace]] of the viewing of programmes from regional television in the neighbouring German ''[[States of Germany|Land]]'' of [[Baden-Württemberg]] – the inhabitants of [[Strasbourg]] had, for example, been able to watch the coronation in June 1953 of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] only on West German television – Télé-Strasbourg began broadcasting on 15 October 1953.

[[Marseille]] followed on 20 September 1954, [[Lyon]] on 8 November 1954, [[Toulouse]] in August 1961, [[Bordeaux]] on 25 January 1962, and most other regional centres opened shortly thereafter.

From late 1963, the regional programmes were also broadcast on ''La deuxième chaîne'' by using optical standard conversion in the regional centres (a 625 lines camera aimed at an 819 lines monitor with a special CRT) in order to better adapt the regional coverage to the new "regions" created in France, and they remained even after the opening of ''La troisième chaîne'' (The Third Channel) under the ORTF on 31 December 1972, all three networks broadcasting the regional news, sometimes from two or even three different production centres (e.g. Niort broadcasting Poitiers on networks 1 and 3, and Nantes on network 2).

&lt;!-- Please do not replace "Reddit" with "reddit", per MOS:TM --&gt;
'''Reddit''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|d|ɪ|t}}, stylized in its logo as '''reddit''') is an American [[social news]] [[Social network aggregation|aggregation]], web content [[rating site|rating]], and [[Internet forum#Discussion|discussion]] website. Registered members submit content to the site such as links, text posts, and images, which are then voted up or down by other members. Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called "subreddits", which cover a variety of topics including news, science, movies, video games, music, books, fitness, food, and image-sharing. Submissions with more up-votes appear towards the top of their subreddit and, if they receive enough votes, ultimately on the site's front page. Despite strict rules prohibiting harassment, Reddit's administrators spend considerable resources on moderating the site.&lt;ref name=Ohlheiser/&gt;

As of February 2018, Reddit had 542 million monthly visitors (234 million unique users), ranking as the #3 most visited website in U.S. and #6 in the world, according to [[Alexa Internet]], with 57.4% of its user base coming from the [[United States]], followed by the [[United Kingdom]] at 7.5% and [[Canada]] at 6.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com |title= Reddit.com Site Info | publisher= [[Alexa Internet]] |accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across 2015, Reddit saw 82.54 billion pageviews, 73.15 million submissions, 725.85 million comments, and 6.89 billion upvotes from its users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Reddit in 2015 | url = http://www.redditblog.com/2015/12/reddit-in-2015.html | date = December 30, 2015 | website=Reddit | accessdate = January 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reddit was founded by [[University of Virginia]] roommates [[Steve Huffman]] and [[Alexis Ohanian]] in 2005. [[Condé Nast Publications]] acquired the site in October 2006. Reddit became a subsidiary of Condé Nast's parent company, [[Advance Publications]], in September 2011. As of August 2012, Reddit operated as an independent entity, although Advance was its largest shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://redditblog.com/2013/08/reddit-myth-busters_6.html#independent-reddit-inc|title=myth: Condé Nast owns Reddit.|website=Reddit|date=August 6, 2013|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reddit is based in San Francisco, California. In October 2014, Reddit raised $50 million in a funding round led by [[Sam Altman]] and including investors [[Marc Andreessen]], [[Peter Thiel]], [[Ron Conway]], [[Snoop Dogg]], and [[Jared Leto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/with-reddit-deal-snoop-dogg-moonlights-as-a-tech-investor/ |title=With Reddit Deal, Snoop Dogg Moonlights as a Tech Investor |last=Alden |first=William |date=October 1, 2014 |website=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their investment valued the company at $500 million then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/08/reddit-reportedly-raising-50m-at-a-500m-valuation/ |title=Reddit reportedly raising $50M at a $500M valuation |last=Cheredar |first=Tom |date=September 8, 2014|accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://recode.net/2014/09/07/reddit-raising-a-big-round-and-some-y-combinator-players-are-in-the-mix/ |title=Reddit Raising a Big Round, and Some Y Combinator Players Are in the Mix |last1=Kafka |first1=Peter | first2=Kara |last2=Swisher |date=September 7, 2014|accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, Reddit raised $200 million for a $1.8 billion valuation, with Advance Publications remaining the majority stakeholder.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian|title=Reddit raised $200 million in funding and is now valued at $1.8 billion|last=Wagner|first=Kurt|date=2017-07-31|website=[[Recode]]|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The site is a collection of entries submitted by its registered users, essentially a [[bulletin board system]]. The name "Reddit" is a [[play-on-words]] with the phrase "read it", i.e., "I read it on Reddit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq|title=Reddit Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=April 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's content is divided into numerous categories, and the most popular posts from these 'subreddits' are visible on the front page to those who browse the site without an account. {{As of | May 2016}}, 
there are over 11,400 active subreddits.&lt;ref name="2016-update"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blog.reddit.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://redditblog.com/2013/06/browse-future-of-reddit-re-introducing.html|title=Browse the Future of Reddit: Re-Introducing Multireddits|date=June 7, 2013|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="is an admin"&gt;"Active" is defined as [https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1fvovq/browse_the_future_of_reddit_reintroducing/cae97qu?context=1 "subreddits that had at least 5 posts or comments in the past day"], according to /u/chromakode who [https://www.reddit.com/about/team is an admin]&lt;/ref&gt;

When items (links or text posts) are submitted to a subreddit, the users, called "[[#Users|redditors]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/redditor Redditor – definition of Redditor] Oxford Dictionaries Online&lt;/ref&gt; can vote for or against them (upvote/downvote). Each subreddit has a front page that shows newer submissions that have been rated highly. Redditors can also post comments about the submission, and respond back and forth in a conversation-tree of comments; the comments themselves can also be upvoted and downvoted. The front page of the site itself shows a combination of the highest-rated posts out of all the subreddits a user is subscribed to.

Front-page rank—for both the general front page and for individual subreddits—is determined by the age of the submission, positive ("upvoted") to negative ("downvoted") feedback ratio and the total vote-count.&lt;ref name="SEOmoz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seomoz.org/blog/reddit-stumbleupon-delicious-and-hacker-news-algorithms-exposed|title=Reddit algorithm|website=[[seomoz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of submissions cycle through these front pages daily.

The site's logo and its mascot is a line drawing of an alien nicknamed "Snoo". Subreddits often use themed variants of Snoo relevant to the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redditblog.com/2013/06/whats-snoo.html|title=blog.reddit -- what's new on reddit: What's Snoo?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most of the site functions like a bulletin board or [[message board]], each subreddit has the option of having an associated [[wiki]] that can provide supplementary material like instructions, recommended reading, or collaboration for real-life events.

=== Users ===
Registering an account with Reddit is free and does not require an [[email]] address. {{As of|June 2015}}, there were 36 million user accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redditblog.com/2015/06/happy-10th-birthday-to-us-celebrating.html Happy 10th birthday to us celebrating] Reddit&lt;/ref&gt; While logged in, Reddit users (known as redditors) have the ability to vote on submissions and comments to increase or decrease their visibility and submit links and comments. Users with enough experience and accumulated points can also create their own subreddit on a topic of their choosing, and interested users can add it to their front page by subscribing to it. Reddit comments and submissions are occasionally abbreviated and peppered with [[jargon]], ranging from OP (for "[[Original Poster]]"—the user who posted the submission being commented upon) to [[Not safe for work|NSFW]] (for "not safe for work"—indicating the post has graphic or sexually explicit content).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moreadvertising.com/blog/2012/12/07/glossary-of-reddit-terms-and-abbreviations/ |title=Reddit Terms and Abbreviations |publisher=Moreadvertising.com |accessdate=December 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819034418/http://www.moreadvertising.com/blog/2012/12/07/glossary-of-reddit-terms-and-abbreviations/ |archivedate=August 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Reddit gold|Karma}} Users earn "post karma" and "comment karma" points for submitting text posts, link posts, and comments, which accumulate on their user profile. "Post karma" refers to karma points received from text and link posts, while "comment karma" refers to karma points received from comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=What is karma? | website=Reddit Help | date=2016-07-19 | url=http://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204511829-What-is-karma- | access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users may also be gifted "Reddit gold" if another user particularly valued the comment or post, generally due to humorous or high-quality content; this process is known as "gilding". "Reddit gold" unlocks several features not accessible to regular users, such as comment highlighting, ad-blocking, exclusive subreddits, and a personalized Snoo (known as a "snoovatar").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=What is Reddit Gold—and why do people keep giving it away? | website=The Daily Dot | date=2017-07-24 | url=https://www.dailydot.com/debug/what-is-reddit-gold/ | access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Create your own reddit alien avatar with reddit gold|url=https://redditblog.com/2015/01/07/create-your-own-reddit-alien-avatar-with-reddit-gold/|website=redditblog.com|accessdate=4 November 2017|date=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reddit also created a system of points called "creddits". Reddit gold creddits are like gift certificates: each creddit allows a user to give one month of Reddit gold to someone else. Creddits confer status, not perquisites. They serve as a badge of honor for a user among their peers, although redditors have attempted to redeem points before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://redditblog.com/2009/06/weve-got-mail.html |title=We've Got Mail!|website=Reddit |accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reddit allows submissions that do not link externally. These are called "self posts" or "text submissions". Many discussion-based subreddits allow solely text submissions such as "AskReddit"—where users are only allowed to pose broad, discussion based questions to the community at large. Self posts at first did not accumulate karma points for the submitter.  {{as of|July 2016}}, however, these text-only posts also generate post karma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4tmb16/karma_for_textposts_aka_selfposts/|title=Karma for text-posts (AKA self-posts) : announcements|website=Reddit|author=powerlanguage|date=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reddit Mr. Splashy Pants.png|thumb|right|[[Mister Splashy Pants]] logo used on November 27, 2007]] Reddit communities occasionally coordinate Reddit-external projects such as skewing polls on other websites, like the 2007 incident when [[Greenpeace]] allowed web users to decide the name of a humpback whale it was tracking. Reddit users voted en masse to name the whale "Mr. Splashy Pants", and Reddit administrators encouraged the prank by changing the site logo to a whale during the voting. In December of that year, [[Mister Splashy Pants]] was announced as the winner of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Feature story |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/splashy-101207/ |title=Mister Splashy Pants the whale – you named him, now save him |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date=December 10, 2007 |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the site, redditors commemorate their "cake day" once a year, on the anniversary of the day their account was created. Cake day adds an icon of a small slice of cake next to the user's name for 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/cakeday |title=Enjoy your complimentary karma |website=Reddit |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redditors can "friend" one another, which gives a redditor quick access to posting and comments of their friend list. The commenting system and friend system, along with a certain "Reddit ethos" (called ''reddiquette'' on Reddit), lend Reddit some aspects of a [[social networking service]], though not to the extent of [[Facebook]], [[Google+]], or other social networking websites. The Reddit community socializes at meetings held at local parks and bars around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/ |title=Reddit Worldwide Meetups |website=Reddit |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many localized subreddits for local in-person meetings exist.

=== Subreddits ===
&lt;!--DO NOT ADD INFORMATION ON ANY SUBREDDITS TO THIS SECTION WITHOUT CITING A RELIABLE SECONDARY SOURCE THAT ESTABLISHES NOTABILITY OF THAT SUBREDDIT--&gt;
[[File:American Chemical Society - What Chemists Do - Nathan Allen.webm|thumbtime=15|thumb|right|Nathan Allen speaks about /r/science to the [[American Chemical Society]]]]

Reddit entries are organized into user-created&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Re: Can I make my own subreddit? |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/hmddo/can_i_make_my_own_subreddit/c1wlqgu |date=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; areas of interest called "subreddits". Originally, there was a primary "main-reddit", and other areas were "subreddits". There is no longer a single main-reddit. Initially it was replaced by a group of "default subreddits". {{As of|June 2017}}, an introductory page was substituted prompting users to customize their "subscriptions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reddit's new signup experience|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/6eh6ga/|accessdate=June 2, 2017|date=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subscribed subreddits appear on a user's front page and on a top navigation bar, and can deal with a large range of topics—such as video games, books, discussion, and music.

There are over 11,400 active total subreddits to peruse,&lt;ref name="2016-update"&gt;[http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/reddit-stats/ By the Numbers: 60+ Amazing Reddit Statistics] expandedramblings.com, Digital Tracking Blog, downloaded 10/23/2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blog.reddit.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="is an admin"/&gt; including the former default set of 50 subreddits. This includes an aggregation of content termed "/r/popular", featuring top ranked posts across all of Reddit, with the exception of controversial subreddits (including both pro and anti-Trump communities, as well as those related to [[Gamergate controversy|Gamergate]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Menegus|first1=Bryan|title=Reddit Is Finally Fixing its Trump Spam Problem|url=https://gizmodo.com/reddit-is-finally-fixing-its-trump-spam-problem-1792061056|accessdate=February 2, 2018|publisher=Gizmodo|date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This replaced "/r/all", which doesn't filter controversial topics; it is still accessible via an "All" link at the top of /r/popular.

In an interview with [[Memeburn]], Erik Martin, Reddit GM, remarked that their "approach is to give the community moderators or curators as much control as possible so that they can shape and cultivate the type of communities they want".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Atagana|first1=Michelle|title=Creating a more curious generation through memes: Q&amp;A with Reddit GM|url=http://memeburn.com/2014/08/creating-a-curious-generation-through-memes-qa-with-reddit-gm/|accessdate=September 11, 2014|publisher=Memeburn.com|date=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular subreddits include:

==== April Fools' Day ====
{{Main|The Button (Reddit)|Place (Reddit)}}
On [[April Fools' Day]] 2015, a [[social experiment]] subreddit called /r/thebutton appeared. It displayed a button and a 60-second countdown timer. User accounts created before that day were eligible to participate. A user could only click the button once, or opt not to click it. If a user clicked the button the timer was globally reset to 60 seconds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2015/4/10/8383165/reddit-button-explained|title=The button: the fascinating social experiment driving Reddit crazy|first1=Timothy |last1=Lee |date=April 14, 2015 |website=Vox |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |accessdate=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the user's "flair" (an icon next to the user's name) changed color. Colors were assigned based on a gradient from purple to red with purple signifying up to 60 seconds and red as low as 0 seconds. The countdown reached zero several times due to technical problems but eventually expired without further problems on June 5, 2015, after which the subreddit was archived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redditblog.com/2015/06/the-button-has-ended.html|title=The button has ended|author=powerlanguage |date=June 8, 2015|website=Reddit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For April Fools' Day 2016, another experiment was launched involving the "Robin" chat widget. After clicking a titular button, an [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]-like chat window was opened with one other user, and allowed a certain time to pick among three options, "Grow," "Stay" and "Leave".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-robin-what-it-is-and-how-it-works-2016-4 Reddit's 'Robin' is a brilliant social experiment that pits millions of internet users against each other] Business Insider April 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; "Grow" would join the chat with another group, "Stay" would close the group chat and create a subreddit with that group as moderators and "Leave" would close the group chat.

April Fools' Day 2017 featured a social experiment based on /r/place. The subreddit contained a collaborative [[pixel]] art canvas, where a user could place a pixel every five minutes (the timer was temporarily ten and twenty minutes for a few hours on April 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reddit's new 'Place' is forcing millions of users to work together to make something great|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/reddit-place-april-fools-experiment-canvas-2017-3?r=US&amp;IR=T|accessdate=1 April 2017|website=Business Insider|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people worked together to create large graphics, such as flags or symbols. Often subreddits would come together as a group to add a graphic from that community to place.

For April Fools Day' 2018, an experiment launched on the subreddit /r/circleoftrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Looking back at r/CircleofTrust |url=https://redditblog.com/2018/05/22/looking-back-at-r-circleoftrust/ |website=Upvoted |publisher=Reddit |accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon clicking a button, each user was given one "circle" that they could entrust to others with the circle's password key to unlock and join the circle. While each user received one personal circle, they could join or betray any other user circles. Clicking the "join" button on another's circle would cause the owner's circle to grow bigger, while the "betray" button would cause the owner's circle to no longer function (having "betrayed" the owner's trust). On the /r/circleoftrust subreddit, all users have a "flair" next to their username that displays the number of users who've joined their personal circle, followed by the number of other circles the user has joined. Those who had betrayed another user's circle have a [[null sign]] ("∅") next to their numbered flair. The experiment ended on April 6, 2018.

In May 2012, Reddit joined the [[Internet Defense League]], a group formed to organize future protests.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetdefenseleague.org/members|title=The Internet Defense League - Protecting the Free Internet since 2012|website=internetdefenseleague.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 14, 2013, Reddit began accepting the digital currency [[Bitcoin]] for its Reddit Gold subscription service through a partnership with bitcoin payment processor [[Coinbase]].&lt;ref name=RedditGold&gt;{{cite web|last=Olanoff|first=Drew|title=Reddit Starts Accepting Bitcoin for Reddit Gold Purchases Thanks To Partnership With Coinbase|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/14/reddit-starts-accepting-bitcoin-for-reddit-gold-purchases-thanks-to-partnership-with-coinbase/|publisher=Techcrunch|accessdate= February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Reddit announced Redditmade, a service which allowed moderators to create merchandise for their subreddits.

Reddit launched a new blocking tool in an attempt to curb [[online harassment]] in April 2016. The tool allows a user to hide posts and comments from selected redditors in addition to blocking private messages from those redditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Reddit Launches New Block Tools To Help Temper Harassment|url=http://www.hngn.com/articles/195447/20160406/reddit-launches-blocking-tool-fight-trolling-harassment.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A redditor is blocked by clicking an inbox button.

In 2015, Reddit had about 100 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/reddit-survived-meltdown-can-fix/|title=Inside Reddit’s Plan to Recover From Its Epic Meltdown|last=Hempel|first=Jessi|date=2015|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-08-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2017, their number had increased to around 140, then rising to 230 in July.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In April 2018, Reddit rolled out a new website design. The old design can still be accessed at old.reddit.com.

=== Technology ===
Reddit was originally written in [[Common Lisp]] but was rewritten in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] in December 2005.&lt;ref name="reddit.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=steve [spez] |url=https://redditblog.com/2005/12/on-lisp.html |title="On lisp" blog post by Reddit founder "spez", detailing the reasons for switching to python from lisp |publisher=Blog.reddit.com |date=December 5, 2005 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The switch was for wider access to [[Library (computing)|code libraries]] and greater development flexibility. The Python web framework that former Reddit employee Swartz developed to run the site, ''web.py'', is available as an open-source project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webpy.org/ |title=Official web.py site |publisher=Webpy.org |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2009|11|10|df=US}}, Reddit uses [[Pylons web framework|Pylons]] as its web framework.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.pylonshq.com/display/pylonscommunity/Sites+Using+Pylons Sites Using Pylons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913152149/http://wiki.pylonshq.com/display/pylonscommunity/Sites+Using+Pylons |date=2008-09-13 }} – Pylons Community&amp;nbsp;– PythonWeb&lt;/ref&gt;

From June 18, 2008 until September 2017, Reddit was an [[open source]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=steve [spez] |url=https://redditblog.com/2008/06/reddit-goes-open-source.html |title=Reddit goes open source |publisher=Blog.reddit.com |date=June 17, 2008 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, all of the code and libraries written for Reddit were freely available on [[GitHub]], with the exception of the anti-spam/cheating portions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki |title=Reddit GitHub |accessdate=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2017|09|01|df=US}}, Reddit's main code repositories, backing its desktop and mobile websites, are no longer open source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An update on the state of the reddit/reddit and reddit/reddit-mobile repositories|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/6xfyfg/an_update_on_the_state_of_the_redditreddit_and/|website=Reddit|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reddit is killing off access to its main source code, because open source is bad for competition|url=https://betanews.com/2017/09/04/reddit-open-source-changes/|website=BetaNews|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2009|11|10|df=US}}, Reddit decommissioned their own servers and migrated to [[Amazon Web Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=jeremy [jedberg] |url=https://redditblog.com/2009/11/moving-to-cloud.html |title=Moving to the cloud |publisher=Blog.reddit.com |date=November 10, 2009 |accessdate=December 4, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410193437/http://www.redditblog.com/2009/11/moving-to-cloud.html |archive-date=April 10, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reddit uses [[PostgreSQL]] as their primary datastore and is slowly moving to [[Apache Cassandra]], a column-oriented datastore. It uses [[RabbitMQ]] for offline processing, [[HAProxy]] for load balancing and [[memcached]] for caching. In early 2009, Reddit started using [[jQuery]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://redditblog.com/2009/01/reddit-now-powered-by-jquery.html What's new on Reddit: Reddit now powered by jQuery] – Posted by Chris Slowe (keysersosa) (Friday, January 30, 2009) – blog.reddit&lt;/ref&gt; On June 7, 2010, Reddit staff launched a revamped mobile interface featuring rewritten [[CSS]], a new color scheme, and a multitude of improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://redditblog.com/2010/06/better-mobile-reddit-for-all.html |title=A better mobile Reddit for all |website=Reddit |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2010, Reddit outsourced the Reddit search engine to Flaptor, who used its search product IndexTank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://redditblog.com/2010/07/new-search.html |title=Reddit Blog post announcing the use of IndexTank search engine}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2012|7|12|df=US}}, Reddit uses [[Amazon CloudSearch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/wqx7o/does_reddit_using_amazon_cloud_search/c5fut4i |title=Does Reddit using Amazon Cloud Search? |workreddit.com= |date=July 17, 2012 |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several unofficial applications that use the Reddit [[API]] in the [[Google Play]] store, and [[F-Droid]] repository.

== Community and culture ==
The website is known for its open nature and diverse user community that generate its content.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/ama-how-a-weird-internet-thing-became-a-mainstream-delight/282860/ AMA how a weird internet thing became a mainstream delight] [[The Atlantic]] January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Its demographics allows for wide-ranging subject areas, or main subreddits, that receive much attention, as well as the ability for smaller subreddits to serve more niche purposes. For example, the University of Reddit, a subreddit that exists to communally teach, emerged from the ability to enter and leave the online forum, the "classroom", at will, and classes ranging from computer science to music, to fine art theory exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ureddit.com/ |title=The University of Reddit |publisher=UReddit |accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unique possibilities that subreddits provide create new opportunities for raising attention and fostering discussion across many areas. In gaining popularity in terms of unique users per day, Reddit has been a platform for many to raise publicity for a number of causes. And with that increased ability to garner attention and a large audience, users can use one of the largest communities on the Internet for new, revolutionary, and influential purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blueglass.com/blog/could-reddit-be-the-worlds-most-influential-website/ |title=Could Reddit be the world's most influential website? |publisher=BlueGlass |accessdate=April 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504154827/http://www.blueglass.com/blog/could-reddit-be-the-worlds-most-influential-website/ |archivedate=May 4, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the userbase of Reddit has given birth to other websites, including [[image sharing]] community and [[image hosting service|image host]] [[Imgur]], which started in 2009 as a gift to Reddit's community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/7zlyd/my_gift_to_reddit_i_created_an_image_hosting/|title=My Gift to Reddit: I created an image hosting service that doesn't suck.

In 2016 the Pew Research Center published research showing that 4% of U.S. adults use reddit, of which 67% are men. 78% of users get news from Reddit.&lt;ref name=journalism&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.org/2016/02/25/reddit-news-users-more-likely-to-be-male-young-and-digital-in-their-news-preferences/ |title=Seven-in-Ten Reddit Users Get News on the Site |last=Barthel |first=Michael |last2=Stoking |first2=Galen |last3=Holcomb |first3=Jesse |last4=Mitchell |first4=Amy |quote=While just 4% of U.S. adults report using Reddit, about seven-in-ten of these users (78%) get news on the site.|date=February 25, 2016|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Users tend to be significantly younger than average with less than 1% of users being 65 or over.&lt;ref name=journalism/&gt;

Its popularity has enabled users to take unprecedented advantage of such a large community. Its innovative socially ranked rating and sorting system drives a method that is useful for fulfilling certain goals of viewership or simply finding answers to interesting questions. User sentiments about the website's function and structure include feelings about the breadth and depth of the discussions on Reddit and how the site makes it easy to discover new and interesting items. Almost all of the user reviews on Alexa.com, which rates Reddit's monthly unique traffic rating 125th in the United States, mention Reddit's "good content" as a likable quality. However, others raise the negative aspects of the potential for Reddit's communities to possess a "hive mind" of sorts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com |title=Reddit.com Site Info |publisher=Alexa.com |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; embodying some negative aspects of group interaction theories like [[crowd psychology]] and [[collective consciousness]].

=== Philanthropy ===
Reddit and its subreddits have conducted multiple charity projects, some short-term and others ongoing. Among the events:
* In early October 2010, a story was posted on Reddit about a seven-year-old girl, Kathleen Edward, who was in the advanced stages of [[Huntington's disease]].

==== Internet privacy, neutrality and anonymity ====
Many reddit users are highly engaged in the defense of [[Internet privacy]], [[net neutrality]] and [[Internet anonymity]]. In advance of legislation that endangers these redditors typically set up pages to organize protest, create or curate content, call responsible authorities and inform about their issues and e.g. relevant tools and organizations.

On January 11, 2012, Reddit announced that it would be participating in a 12-hour sitewide blackout in protest of the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]].&lt;ref name="gamepolitics.com"/&gt; The blackout occurred on January 18 and coincided with the blackouts of Wikipedia and several other websites. In May 2012, Reddit joined the [[Internet Defense League]], a group formed to organize future protests.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Reddit effect ===
{{Main|Slashdot effect}}
Also known as the "[[Slashdot]] effect", the Reddit effect occurs when a smaller website has a high influx of traffic after being linked to on Reddit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/newseditors/2012/08/the-reddit-effect.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101224936/http://blogs.abc.net.au/newseditors/2012/08/the-reddit-effect.html|title=The Reddit effect |author=abc blog |publisher=ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |date=August 31, 2012 |accessdate=October 1, 2013|archivedate=November 1, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also called the "Reddit Hug of Death" among the website's users. Because Reddit is such a large site, the traffic is immense and can easily crash smaller sites. In order for users to see crashed websites, several Reddit bots have been created that take a snapshot of the website before large amounts of traffic flood the affected website.

=== "Restoring Truthiness" campaign ===
As a response to [[Glenn Beck]]'s August 28, 2010, [[Restoring Honor rally]] (heavily promoted by him in his [[Fox News]] broadcasts during the summer), in September 2010 Reddit users started a movement to persuade satirist [[Stephen Colbert]] to have a counter-rally in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Colbert Rally"&gt;{{cite news|last=Friedman |first=Megan |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/09/14/reddit-campaign-for-colbert-rally-breaks-charity-records/ |title=Reddit Campaign for Colbert Rally Breaks Donation Record |publisher=Time NewsFeed |date=September 14, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement, which came to be called "Restoring Truthiness", was started by user mrsammercer, in a post where he described waking up from a dream in which Stephen Colbert was holding a satirical rally in D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=mrsammercer |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/d7ntl/ive_had_a_vision_and_i_cant_shake_it_colbert/ |title=I've had a vision and I can't shake it: Colbert needs to hold a satirical rally in DC |website=Reddit |date=August 31, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes, "This would be the high water mark of American satire. Half a million people pretending to suspend all rational thought in unison. Perfect harmony. It'll feel like San Francisco in the late 60s, only we won't be able to get any [[LSD|acid]]."

The idea resonated with the Reddit community, which launched a campaign to bring the event to life. Over $600,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=39361 |title=Restoring Truthiness donor page |publisher=Donorschoose.org |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was raised for charity to gain the attention of Colbert. The campaign was mentioned on-air several times, and when the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]] was held in Washington, D.C. on October 30, 2010, thousands of redditors made the journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schiraldi |first=Mike |url=https://redditblog.com/2010/11/buy-shirts-remember-rally-question.html |title=Buy Shirts, Remember the Rally, Question Colbert, and Smile |publisher=blog.reddit |date=November 12, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a post-rally press conference, Reddit co-founder Ohanian asked, "What role did the Internet campaign play in convincing you to hold this rally?" [[Jon Stewart]] responded by saying that, though it was a very nice gesture, he and Colbert had already thought of the idea and the deposit for using the [[National Mall]] was already paid during the summer, so it acted mostly as a "validation of what we were thinking about attempting".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaite.com/tv/jon-stewart-and-stephen-colbert-hold-post-rally-to-restore-sanity-press-conference/ Rally to Restore Sanity – Press Conference – Video] [[Mediaite]]. October 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In a message to the Reddit community, Colbert later added, "I have no doubt that your efforts to organize and the joy you clearly brought to your part of the story contributed greatly to the turnout and success."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ee20j/stephen_colbert_has_answered_your_questions/ |title=Stephen Colbert has answered your questions : IAmA |website=Reddit |date=November 30, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who break the rule are subject to a site-wide ban, and their posts and even entire communities may be removed for breaking the rule.

In late October 2013, the moderators of the "politics" subreddit banned a large group of websites.

Also in August 2014, moderators and administrators removed a sizeable amount of content related to the [[Gamergate controversy]]; one thread in the "gaming" subreddit lost almost 24,000 comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/2dz0gs/totalbiscuit_discusses_the_state_of_games/|title=TotalBiscuit discusses the state of games journalism, Steam Greenlight, ethics, DMCA abuse and Depression Quest. : gaming|website=reddit}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This included the subreddit "ZoeQuinnDiscussion", which was banned for violating the Reddit rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/ZoeQuinnDiscussion|archive-url=https://archive.is/20160225022422/https://www.reddit.com/r/ZoeQuinnDiscussion|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 25, 2016|title=ZoeQuinnDiscussion: banned|website=Reddit|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administrators attributed the bans to [[4chan]] for raiding threads and causing harm, the accuracy of which was debated by some redditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/2ecvrb/latest_zoe_quinn_drama_explodes/cjypzmn|title=cupcake1713 comments on Latest Zoe Quinn drama explodes.

On December 18, 2014, Reddit took the unusual step of banning a subreddit, "SonyGOP," that was being used to distribute [[Sony Pictures hack|hacked Sony files]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldman|first1=David|title=Reddit takes down Sony hack forum|url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/17/technology/security/reddit-sony-hack-forum-ban/|accessdate=January 4, 2015|date=December 29, 2014|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2015 ===
After [[Ellen Pao]] became CEO, she was initially a target of criticism by users who objected to her lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Celarier|first1=Michelle|title=Users lash out at Reddit boss for 'deleting' posts on hubby's lawsuit|url=https://nypost.com/2015/03/18/users-lash-out-at-reddit-boss-for-deleting-posts-on-hubbys-lawsuit/|publisher=New York Post|accessdate=June 27, 2015|date=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on June 10, 2015, Reddit shut down the 150,000-subscriber "fatpeoplehate" subreddit and four others citing issues related to harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Griffin|first=Andrew|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/reddit-bans-communities-including-fat-people-hate-as-users-say-anti-harassment-policies-could-be-10312251.html|title=Reddit bans communities including 'Fat People Hate' as users say anti-harassment policies could be 'beginning of the end'|date=2015-06-11|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=2017-02-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move was seen as very controversial; some commenters said that the bans went too far, while others said that the bans did not go far enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woollacott|first1=Emma|title=Users Flock To Voat As Reddit Shuts Harassing Groups|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2015/06/11/users-flock-to-voat-as-reddit-shuts-harassing-groups/2/|website=Forbes|accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the latter complaints concerned a subreddit that was "expressing support" for the perpetrator of the [[Charleston church shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wendling|first=Mike|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-33288367|title=What should social networks do about hate speech?|website=BBC News|accessdate=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to the accusations of "skewed enforcement", Reddit reaffirmed their commitment to free expression and stated that "There are some subreddits with very little viewership that get highlighted repeatedly for their content, but those are a tiny fraction of the content on the site."

On July 2, 2015, Reddit began experiencing a series of blackouts as [[Internet forum#Moderators|moderators]] set popular subreddit communities to private, in an event dubbed "AMAgeddon," a [[portmanteau]] of AMA ("ask me anything") and [[Armageddon]]. This was done in protest of the recent firing of Victoria Taylor, an administrator who helped organize citizen-led interviews with famous people on the popular "Ask me Anything" subreddit. Organizers of the blackout also expressed resentment about the recent severance of the communication between Reddit and the moderators of subreddits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-33379571 |title=Reddit in uproar after staff sacking |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=July 3, 2015 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |access-date=July 3, 2015 |quote="About 100 chat sections, or sub-reddits, that together have millions of readers are believed to have been shut. Reddit's only comment about the issue has been to say that it did not talk about 'individual employee matters'. The protests were led by the volunteer moderators of the AMA section, which said in an explanatory posting that they needed Ms Taylor to keep the sub-reddit functioning. Ms Taylor helped organise guests for AMAs and worked to verify that people due to answer questions were who they said they were. There had been no explanation of why she was suddenly sacked, said the administrators."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blackout intensified on July 3 when former [[Online community manager|community manager]] David Croach gave an AMA about being fired. Before deleting his posts, he stated that Ellen Pao dismissed him with one year of health coverage when he had cancer and did not recover quickly enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reddit: Laute Rufe nach Absetzung von CEO Ellen Pao|url=http://derstandard.at/2000018574154/Reddit-Laute-Rufe-nach-Absetzung-von-CEO-Ellen-Pao|accessdate=July 5, 2015|date=July 4, 2015|quote=Zwar sind einige Foren wieder entsperrt, trotzdem ist Pao weiterhin Ziel vielerlei Angriffe.

In September 2016, a Redditor named ''mormondocuments'' released thousands of administrative documents belonging to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], an action driven by the ex-Mormon and atheist communities of that site.

Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/reddit-bans-alt-right-subreddit/|title=Reddit shuts down 'alt-right' subreddit|newspaper=CNET|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/02/01/reddit-bans-alt-right-group.html|title=Reddit Bans Alt-Right Group|last=Resnick|first=Gideon|date=2017-02-02|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forum's users and moderators accused Reddit administrators of having political motivations for the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weinberger|first=Matt|date=February 2, 2017|title=Reddit bans a major alt-right community — and there may be a very good reason|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-reddit-banned-alt-right-2017-2|newspaper=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/02/reddit-bans-far-right-groups-altright-alternativeright|title=Reddit bans far-right groups altright and alternativeright|last=Hern|first=Alex|date=2017-02-02|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2018 ===
In March 2018, it was revealed that Reddit's CEO had hidden Russian troll activity from users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/reddit-rises-up-against-ceo-for-hiding-russian-trolls|title=Reddit Rises Up Against CEO for Hiding Russian Trolls|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12 the creator and head moderator of the GamerGate subreddit /r/kotakuinaction, removed all of the moderators and set the forum to private, alleging it to have become "infested with racism and sexism". A Reddit employee restored the forum and its moderators an hour later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inquisitr.com/opinion/4985599/opinions-are-split-on-the-attempt-to-shut-down-popular-subreddit-r-kotakuinaction/|title=Opinions Are Split On The Attempt To Shut Down Popular Subreddit r/KotakuInAction [Opinion]|date=2018-07-14|work=The Inquisitr|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/13/17568556/kotakuinaction-reddit-mod-shut-down-administrator|title=Reddit employee saves GamerGate subreddit, KotakuInAction, after founder closes it|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:P. T. Selbit sawing a woman in half trick.png|thumb|Magician [[P. T. Selbit]] performing a version of the trick in 1937]]
'''Sawing a woman in half''' is a generic name for a number of stage [[magic trick]]s in which a person (traditionally a [[magician's assistant|female assistant]]) is apparently sawn or divided into two or more pieces.

==History==
There remains a debate about the origin of sawing illusions, with some sources saying a magician named Torrini may have performed the first version in front of [[Pope Pius VII]] in 1809.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web
 |first       = Gary R

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is more likely that the story is a fiction which has its roots in the writings of the famous French magician [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin|Jean Robert-Houdin]]. In his ''Memoirs'', written in 1858, Robert-Houdin described a sawing illusion performed by a magician named Torrini.

Modern magic inventor and historian [[Jim Steinmeyer]] has concluded that there was probably no real Torrini and the story was merely a way for Robert-Houdin to play with ideas.&lt;ref name="steinmeyer"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested during a court case in 1922 that the trick can be traced back to ancient Egypt; however, this claim has not been substantiated.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clarion"&gt;''Goldin v. Clarion Photoplays'', New York (Dec 1922) [https://web.archive.org/web/20151104073050/http://www.jstor.org/stable/789035 |The Yale Law Journal], Vol. 32, No. 2, p.201&lt;/ref&gt; Wherever the idea originated, until the 1920s it remained just an idea for an effect, rather than a practical application of a method.

It is generally accepted that the first public performance of a sawing illusion was achieved by British magician [[P.T. Selbit]] in January 1921 at the Finsbury Park Empire theatre in London. In fact Selbit had previously performed the illusion in December 1920 before a select audience of promoters and theatrical agents at the [[St. George's Hall, London]], to try to persuade one of them to book his new act for public shows.&lt;ref name="steinmeyer"/&gt; His trick, which he billed as "Sawing Through A Woman", was significantly different from what a modern audience would expect. Selbit's assistant was locked inside a closed wooden crate and could not be seen. The impression that she could not evade the saw was created by the confined space in the box and by ropes tied to her hands, feet, and neck, which were held throughout the illusion by spectators from the audience.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;&lt;ref name="steinmeyer"/&gt;

The question of who was the first woman to be sawn in half has received much less publicity than the question of which magician first presented the illusion. According to Jim Steinmeyer the woman who participated in the December 1920 demonstration was Jan Glenrose, who was Selbit's main assistant at that time and who was also the partner of magician [[Fred Culpitt]].&lt;ref name="steinmeyer"/&gt; In the public performance the role of victim was taken by principal assistant, Betty Barker.&lt;ref name="artandartifice"&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Horace Goldin sawing illusion.png|thumb|A later iteration of Horace Goldin's version of the trick, with a buzzsaw blade]]
Later in 1921, [[Horace Goldin]], a magician working in the United States, presented the first version which might look familiar to modern audiences. Goldin's assistant lay in a box from which her feet, head and hands protruded. Goldin sawed through the middle of the box, inserting metal sheets to cover the cut ends, and then pushed the two halves a little way apart. This process was then reversed, and the assistant released unharmed. Goldin later developed a sawing illusion that dispensed with boxes and used a large buzzsaw.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; The success of Selbit and then Goldin led to more and more magicians trying to imitate them with copies or improved versions of sawing illusions. By November 1921 the Thayer magic company in America was advertising a version for sale. A complete prop from Thayer would cost $175 or they would sell plans for $5.&lt;ref name="steinmeyer"/&gt;

==Effects and variations==
There are many sawing tricks with significant differences in their basic effect. In some, the illusion is merely of a blade passing through an [[magician's assistant|assistant's]] body, while in others it appears that the assistant is severed into two pieces that are moved apart. Some so-called "sawing" illusions do not actually involve a saw but instead use plain blades or blunt dividing panels.

One major group of tricks involves an [[magician's assistant|assistant]] in a box, which conceals her body from view while any cutting takes place. This group includes the "Selbit", "Wakeling" and "Thin Model" tricks as well as several versions associated with [[Horace Goldin]]. Most "box" sawings give the illusion of the two halves of the assistant being moved apart, although there are versions where the effect is simply that a blade must have passed through the assistant's body. In some versions the box completely covers the assistant while in others the assistant's head, hands and feet remain in view during the trick.

===The Selbit sawing===
Several volunteers are recruited from the audience. One or more of these people are invited to tie ropes around the assistant's wrists, ankles and neck. The assistant then steps into a wooden crate or box, which is similar in proportion to but slightly larger than a coffin. The ropes are threaded through holes in the box and the ends are given to volunteers, who are instructed to pull them tight and keep hold of them (the neck rope has an added knot to prevent the assistant being strangled). The assistant is thus secured in a standing [[spreadeagle (position)|spreadeagle]] position in the box. The box is then closed and lifted into a horizontal position on a set of trestles. The magician then slides glass plates through the crate (and apparently through his assistant).

The magician then saws right through the centre of the box, dividing it into two. The sections are pulled slightly apart and the assistant's torso is visible. The impression is that the saw blade must have passed through the assistant's midriff. The assistant is then released from the box and is revealed to be unharmed. This was the illusion performed at the Finsbury Park Empire theatre in London on 17 January 1921.&lt;ref name="bbcmagic"/&gt;

===Goldin's box sawings===
Goldin presented several sawing illusions that involved a box. To audiences  they all appeared largely similar but they involved differing methods, which were steadily improved as time went on and as earlier methods were exposed.&lt;ref name="uspatent"&gt;{{US Patent|1,458,575}} filed 1923
accessdate = 2007-04-03
&lt;/ref&gt; His first performance was at the [[Society of American Magicians]] annual banquet at the McAlpin Hotel, New York, on 3 June 1921. On that occasion the trick was not well received. The box he used was large and not very deceptive and instead of an attractive woman he employed a bellboy as an assistant. The impression given was that he was clumsily and hurriedly trying to cash in on Selbit's success in Britain. However, fellow magician [[Howard Thurston]], who was in the audience, realised the potential of the trick and persuaded Goldin to let him help in its development.

Thurston employed an established magician and prop builder named [[Harry Jansen]] to perfect the illusion. Jansen's improved version of the apparatus featured a smaller box from which the victim's head and feet would protrude during the sawing. Goldin, Thurston and various other magicians employed by Goldin toured the United States performing this trick with great success at theatres belonging to the Keith-Orpheum group.&lt;ref name="steinmeyer"/&gt; Goldin had great promotional acumen and was fond of resorting to legal action to block anyone else, including Selbit, from competing with him in the USA. As a result, Goldin was sometimes wrongly credited as the originator of the sawing illusion.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

The basic form of Goldin's box sawings was as follows. The magician presents a box which is similar in size and proportion to that used in the Selbit sawing but which is already in a horizontal position. An assistant climbs into the box and lies down. In the process her head and hands are seen to emerge from holes in one end of the box and her feet from the other. The box is closed and then sawn through across the middle. Dividers are placed into the box either side of the cut and it is then pulled apart so the sections can be seen clearly separated. The assistant's head and hands are seen sticking out of one section and her feet out of the other. The box is then pushed together again and opened and the assistant emerges unharmed.

===Wakeling===
The magician presents a rectangular table just big enough to accommodate a person lying upon it. An assistant is introduced and several assistants are recruited from the audience. The magician presents a set of restraints consisting of a sturdy collar and a pair of ankle straps, each attached to a length of chain or rope. The assistant sits on the table with her legs stretched out and volunteers are invited to fasten the restraints around her neck and ankles.

The ropes or chains are threaded through holes in the table and the ends given to volunteers, who are instructed to pull them tight and hold them that way throughout the illusion. The assistant is thus pulled down onto her back and secured in that position. Two halves of a large box are presented and fixed in place over the assistant, covering her completely. Side panels are opened to show the assistant is still in place lying flat on her back. The assistant is then divided into two. Sometimes the division is accomplished merely by pushing two metal dividing panels into slots near where the two halves meet.

Sometimes the cutting of the assistant is emphasised by sawing between the two halves of the box before sliding the dividers into place. Catches are released to allow the table to be separated into two halves along with the box. The halves are parted and the assistant thus appears to have been cut into two completely disconnected pieces. The box and table are then pushed together, the restraints are released and the box is opened to allow the assistant to emerge unharmed.

This version of the trick is generally associated with magician and inventor [[Alan Wakeling]]. Whilst Wakeling performed this illusion and perfected aspects of it, the general configuration and method have been attributed to an earlier magician, Virgil Harris Mulkey (1900–1989), aka. "The Great Virgil", who first performed it in 1942 and later passed on the idea to Wakeling.&lt;ref name="charvet"&gt;{{Cite document

===The thin model===
The thin model sawing is one of the most common variants performed by contemporary magicians. The basic arrangement and sequence of events is similar to that described for the Goldin box sawings (see above). However, the box appears very shallow in comparison to Goldin's, which was large by modern standards. The ends of the box are initially open when the assistant climbs in. Once the assistant is lying down she is secured in place by having stocks placed over her neck and ankles. The stocks form the ends of the box. The shallow box adds to the impression that the assistant could not possibly find room to evade the saw blade even if she could release herself from the stocks and try to curl up in one half of the box.

===Transparent boxes===
Magician Les Arnold is reported to have been the first to have devised a clear box sawing (known as the "Crystal Sawing") as far back as 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Mulhern performing the UK TV debut of the Les Arnold Crystal Sawing on ITV's Magic Numbers [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpIScNQ6P8]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pendragons]] performed a variation called "[[Clearly Impossible]]", in which the box used is both particularly slim and also transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Double sawing===
The "double sawing illusion" is a way of adding an extra effect to box-type sawings. It is generally associated with the "thin-model" sawing apparatus. The magician saws two people in half using two sets of apparatus. The people are usually chosen or dressed so as to be clearly distinguishable. For example, they might be in different colored costumes, of different skin colors, or of different genders. After the box halves are separated they are jumbled up and then re-assembled so that the bottom half of one box is matched to the top of the other and vice versa. When the victims emerge, each appears to have been given the other's lower half.

The creation of this version has been credited to magician [[Alan Wakeling]], who devised it for fellow magician [[Channing Pollock (magician)|Channing Pollock]] to perform.&lt;ref name="Lawton"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jigsaw===
An assistant lies down on a table. A frame is placed over her middle. The magician then presents an electric [[Jigsaw (power tool)|jigsaw]] and proceeds to align the blade into a slot in the frame. The magician switches on the saw and apparently uses it to slice through the assistant's waist, which remains obscured by the frame. The saw emerges from the opposite side of the frame. Once the sawing is finished the frame is removed and the assistant is revealed to be in one piece.

===Bow saw===
This variant begins in a similar way to the jig sawing, with the assistant lying on a table and having a frame fixed over her midriff. The magician then presents a [[bow saw]] and proceeds to saw through the assistant, with the blade guided within the frame. Once the blade has apparently passed all the way through the assistant the frame is released and removed. It is then revealed that the assistant is encircled by the handle and blade of the bow saw. Then he/she will have a member of audience come up and look at the props.

===Buzzsaw===
A large apparatus is presented, consisting of a sturdy frame supporting a large [[buzzsaw]] or [[circular saw]] and a table sufficiently large to carry a person lying flat. It is shown that the table travels beneath the saw, leaving little or no gap, so that anything placed upon it in the path of the saw would be sliced through. The table is moved either by an electric mechanism or by some form of manual crank. The buzzsaw is generally driven by an electric motor. To demonstrate the saw is completely genuine, a piece of wood is placed on the table and sliced in two in full view. An assistant is introduced and placed in a horizontal position on the table.

Sometimes the magician might give the impression of hypnotizing the assistant into a rigid trance before having her lifted onto the table. She is secured in place with two metal "straps" that close over her waist and which align close to the plane of the saw. She might also be further secured with straps or manacles at her wrists and ankles. A strip of wood is pushed beneath her waist in line with the saw. The saw is then started and the table set in motion. The saw visibly passes through the assistant and generally sounds like it is sawing through something.

Once the table reaches the end of its travel and the saw is switched off the assistant is released and shown to be in one piece and uninjured. The strip of wood that had been placed beneath her is shown to have been sawn into two strips, thus reinforcing that the saw really did cut in the manner it appeared to. [[Harry Blackstone, Sr.]] was performing this effect in the United States in the 1930s.

===Death Saw===
The ''Death Saw'' is presented as an escape gone wrong. Its best known performer is [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]]. The performer is secured to a table beneath a large buzzsaw or blade, which is set to descend upon them under the control of a timing mechanism. After being secured with various manacles the performer is enclosed in a box. The saw is then set going.

After a while the sides of the box fall away to reveal the performer struggling to escape the manacles. Finally the saw drops before the performer has time to escape. The blade slices right through the performer's body. The two halves of the table are rolled apart so that the performer is clearly separated into two sections. The performer then appears to command the whole process to reverse: The body halves go back together, the saw rises, the box closes. Finally the performer emerges unharmed from the box.

Copperfield has claimed exclusive rights to this illusion; however, others, including Tennessee-based illusion builder Jeff Davis, have asserted that the method and effect were previously published in two magazine articles during the 1960s. The March 1965 edition of ''The Linking Ring'' contains text and diagrams from an Indian author called B. Rakshit giving the basic sawing method. An article in the September 1969 ''Genii Magazine'' outlines the routine including the idea of the saw descending a tower.&lt;ref name="rakshit"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Modern Art===
{{other uses|Modern art (disambiguation)}}
Although not generally classified as a "sawing" illusion, ''Modern Art'' is sometimes billed as an "upright dividing the lady in two". The prop is a vertical cabinet which stands alongside a table-like structure that is half its height. The assistant enters the cabinet through a door in the side away from the table structure. The assistant's face can be seen peering from an opening at the top of the cabinet and a panel at the bottom of the front of the cabinet is opened to show the assistant's legs. A sword or blade is then placed into a slot at the point where the top of the half-height table meets the cabinet. The top of the cabinet then slides across onto the table, giving the impression that the top half of the assistant has been moved sideways and in the process been severed from the legs by the blade. Panels in the front of the cabinet are opened to show the top and bottom halves of the assistant apparently separate. The top of the cabinet is then slid back into its original position and the assistant emerges unharmed. The effect and method are credited to designer Jim Steinmeyer.&lt;ref name="modart"&gt;{{cite web

===Criss Angel's pulling a woman apart===
[[Criss Angel]] performed a trick in which he appeared to pull a woman in half with his hands during an outdoor performance and half of her crawled away.&lt;ref name="Criss Angel 1"&gt;{{cite web

==Methods and exposure==
[[Image:Goldin's illusion 1.svg|thumb|right|Variant 1.]]
[[Image:Goldin's illusion 2.svg|thumb|right|Variant 2.]]
As suggested by the various effects, detailed above, there are numerous methods for accomplishing sawing illusions. Over the years a number of these have been exposed and several have been published and are easily obtainable.

[[Exposure (magic)|Publishing of magic methods]] has proved a controversial subject at times. It has involved battles between those determined to expose methods and magicians, who have sometimes resorted to [[Intellectual rights to magic methods#Court cases|legal action]] to try to preserve secrecy. The sawing illusion has had a prominent role in the history of such battles and has thus contributed to case law.

In September 1921, motivated by concerns about preventing competition from other magicians who might copy him, Horace Goldin forwent secrecy and applied for a patent for ''Sawing a woman in half''. He was awarded U.S. patent number 1,458,575 on 12 June 1923.&lt;ref name="uspatent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="googlepatent"&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT1458575
 |title = ''Illusion Device''
 |publisher = Google
 |accessdate = 2007-04-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is an outline summary the patent:

:One variant presents the front of the box to the audience (A). Expecting the box is the size of an ordinary chest, they may assume that the "victim" is arranged (B), crossing the path of the saw. In reality, the box may be deeper (which the audience cannot see from their perspective), and the "victim" curled up to clear the blade (C).

:Another variant has a false table on which the box rests. This allows the carved out table to be used as a place for the woman to crawl up in and avoid the saw. Her feet are replaced with fakes that are moved with electric motors. These motors have the ability to move the feet, but only slightly, as no technology exists to make realistic-looking feet of flesh or the ability to move the toes of the feet;{{dubious|date=January 2011}} this means that all fake feet must be wearing shoes during the performance. This method is generally not in use today, as the false table must be extremely thick to conceal the assistant.

[[Penn and Teller]] use the second variant of this trick on a regular basis in Las Vegas. They have also performed this trick on [[television]] at least twice: on ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' and during the 2007 [[NBA All-Star Weekend]]. They always reveal how the trick is done.

==Famous performances and depictions==
A number of performances or depictions of sawing illusions have achieved particular fame or notoriety.
* [[P.T. Selbit]]'s original performances in London in January 1921 were special because the effect was new and shocking to audiences of the time. Such was the impact of Selbit's creation that, for decades afterwards, other magicians would try to emulate and improve on what he had done, thus affecting the course of stage magic history.&lt;ref name="bbcmagic"&gt;This performance was recreated in the final episode of the six-part [[BBC Television]] documentary series ''Magic'', originally broadcast in 2004. See {{imdb title|id=0432238|title=Magic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1956, Indian illusionist [[P. C. Sorcar]] used a buzzsaw to cut his wife in two during a televised performance. Just when he had divided her the host quickly signed off and the show ended. This caused horrified viewers to believe she had accidentally been killed. In reality, it was a [[live television]] broadcast and time had run out.&lt;ref&gt;Dawes, A. E., et al. ''Making Magic''. London: Multimedia Books, Ltd, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1957 [[Friz Freleng]] cartoon ''[[Show Biz Bugs]]'', [[Bugs Bunny]] asks for a volunteer for this trick, and [[Daffy Duck]] happily obliges, throughout attempting to expose the fraud of this trick. After the trick is over, Daffy tries to show the audience he isn't cut in half, only for his upper and lower halves to jump whenever he is angry. (His response: "Hmmph. It's a good thing I got [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association|Blue Cross]].")
* Live performances by Peruvian magician [[Richiardi Jr]] are often cited as the most horrific presentations of a sawing illusion. Richiardi used a buzzsaw prop similar to that employed by Sorcar but he greatly added to the shock value by incorporating fake blood and entrails, which were sprayed over the stage (and sometimes beyond it) as the saw went to work.
*The 1962 ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' episode "[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Alfred Hitchcock Presents)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]" depicted sawing a woman in half. The [[NBC television|NBC Television Network]] and sponsor [[Revlon]] determined the episode was too gory and chose not to air it.

==Critical responses and twists==
Jim Steinmeyer has argued that Selbit's introduction of the sawing illusion was a turning point in the history of magic after which gentler styles represented by the likes of [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] were in irreversible decline to be replaced by more sensational presentations that owed something to the shock effect of [[Grand Guignol]] theatre. In particular, Steinmeyer identifies the sawing illusion as the beginning of a fashion for magic featuring female assistants in the role of victim. He says the cliche of "pretty ladies teased and tortured by magicians" was not a cliche prior to Selbit's illusion.

Male assistants were common in magic history and in the Victorian era; the cumbersome clothes imposed on women by the fashions of the time made it impractical for them to squeeze into confined spaces required by some tricks. Changing fashions in the early 20th century made Selbit's choice of a female victim a practical proposition. It was also true that an illusion designed for a lithe woman might be more compact and deceptive than one tailored to fit a man. However, more controversially, a combination of the emancipation of women and a population desensitized by war and exposed to new entertainment phenomena meant Selbit's choice struck a chord in the public imagination. In Steinmeyer's words: "beyond the practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment".&lt;ref name="steinmeyer"/&gt;

Modern magicians, including female performers, have responded by placing a male performer in the role originally filled by a woman. Magician [[Dorothy Dietrich]], who established herself as a leading magician as a teenager has been called the "First woman to saw a man in half."&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;The New York Times {{cite web

Australian magician [[Sue-Anne Webster]] performs a variation on the "thin model" sawing in which she saws husband [[Tim Ellis]] in two with a chainsaw.&lt;ref&gt;The topic of assistants portrayed as victims in violent illusions was featured in "Violent magic" the final episode of the six-part [[BBC]] television documentary series ''Magic'' in 2004, see {{cite web

'''Scenic bios''' is the state of physicality that a performer generates in the act of performance. It is a state of readiness and energy that is above and beyond the daily. Daily energy is that which we all employ during ordinary activity. It is usually the minimum required for practical requirement. Extra daily energy on the other hand, is that which the performer employs by various means such as balance, anatomical alteration, and other less obvious devices such as extra awareness and understanding of certain principles, in the very act of performance. 

Some of these principles, first recognized and formulated in empirical studies by [[Eugenio Barba]], may be learned or they may be inherent. Such principles as [[wikt:equivalence|equivalence]], [[Wiktionary:dilation|dilation]], rhythm and timing, all seem like second nature, and the performer may not know that she is applying them in any strict sense. But, Barba has demonstrated that through physical training and exercises of his devising these principles can become fruitfully exploited by the actor in her endeavours.  

All these principles are believed by Barba to exist in the actors [[pre-expressive]] being. This pre-expressivity is otherwise known as scenic bios, or stage 'presence'.

'''SeeSaw''' was an [[Internet television]] service, born out of the BBC-led [[Kangaroo (video on demand)|Project Kangaroo]] and launched in the UK on 17 February 2010.&lt;ref name="Launch"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/7223006/SeeSaw-chief-executive-looks-forward-to-launch.html| title=SeeSaw chief executive looks forward to launch | publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| date=2010-02-14 | location=London | first=Emma | last=Barnett | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired by the [[Criterion Capital Partners|Criterion Media Group]] in July 2011 but the agreed investment never materialised. The service was shut down on 28 October 2011.&lt;ref name="SeeSaw Shuts PCUK" /&gt; At its peak the site was able to attract 2&amp;nbsp;million users a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/8858698/Criterion-puts-final-nail-in-coffin-for-Project-Kangaroo.html| title=Criterion puts final nail in coffin for Project Kangaroo | publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| date=2011-10-31| location=London| first=Katherine| last=Rushton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
SeeSaw used part of the technology that was originally built for [[Kangaroo (video on demand)|Project Kangaroo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/news/bulletin/mediaam/article/939880/?DCMP=EMC-MediaAMBulletin| title=Arqiva prepares to unveil its SeeSaw VoD content service| publisher=Media Week| date=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the now defunct project owned by [[BBC Worldwide]], [[Channel 4]] and [[ITV plc]]. Project Kangaroo was blocked by the [[Competition Commission]] in February 2009. In September 2009 Project Kangaroo's technology and assets were bought by Arqiva for approximately £8m.&lt;ref name="Launch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/04/project-kangaroo-blocked-by-competition-commission| title=Project Kangaroo blocked by Competition Commission| publisher=[[The Guardian]]| date=2009-02-04 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SeeSaw brand was announced on 3 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/nov/03/seesaw-online-tv-idents| title=SeeSaw online TV service unveils idents| publisher=[[The Guardian]]| date=2009-11-03 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ioko]] developed the software and the user experience for the site, having already developed the software for [[Project Kangaroo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2010/jan/05/online-tv-iplayer| title=YouTube, iPlayer, Sky?

===Beyond the browser===
At launch, SeeSaw CEO Pierre-Jean Sebert confirmed that the company was in talks with set-top box manufacturers, TV manufacturers and game console manufacturers with a view to extending its service to additional screens.&lt;ref name="Set-top box"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2010/02/17/seesaw-in-set-top-box-talks/| title=SeeSaw in set-top box talks| publisher=Broadband TV News| date=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former parent company Arqiva is a member of [[YouView]] which is building an open, internet-connected television platform for the UK market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.projectcanvas.info/index.cfm/news/?mode=alias&amp;alias=Project-Canvas-submits-merger-analysis-to-OFT-as-Arqiva-join-as-partner|title=Project Canvas submits merger analysis to OFT, as Arqiva join as partner|publisher=Project Canvas|date=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, SeeSaw made its first foray away from the computer by making its ad-supported content available through [[Boxee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.reghardware.com/2011/01/28/seesaw_boxee/| title=SeeSaw streams UK TV through Boxee | publisher=reghardware| date=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior Technical Architect, Ben Gidley, acknowledged looking into [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] solutions, although a lack of [[Digital rights management|DRM]] stalled development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.getsatisfaction.com/seesaw/topics/why_while_making_a_new_site_write_it_with_technology_from_the_90s#reply_2675236| title=Apple iPhone and iPad support - why Flash| publisher=[[Get Satisfaction]]| date=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Platforms supporting Adobe Flash were expected to work and Gidley was able to confirm [[Android (operating system)|Android]] compatibility on 15 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://blog.gidley.co.uk/2010/06/seesaw-works-on-android.html| title=SeeSaw works on Android| publisher=Gidley's Gossipings| date=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International licensing===
On 2 August 2010, Pierre-Jean Sebert, said SeeSaw was in late-stage negotiations with media companies in two countries to license its technology. "It started as an opportunity, but we have now equipped ourselves in a strategy to deal with international expansion, on a business-to-business basis through partnerships," Mr Sebert said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/seesaw-in-surprise-talks-on-international-licensing-deals-2041248.html| title=SeeSaw in 'surprise' talks on international licensing deals| publisher=[[The Independent]]| date=2010-08-02 | location=London | first=Nick | last=Clark | accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Sebert revealed that one of the deals was in Europe and the other was in a country "very far away", it was understood that one of the deals could have involved taking the SeeSaw brand name as well.

==Content==
On 2 December 2009, SeeSaw announced a content deal with BBC Worldwide, so shows such as ''[[Cranford (TV series)|Cranford]]'', ''[[Lark Rise to Candleford (TV series)|Lark Rise to Candleford]]'', ''[[That Mitchell and Webb Look]]'' and classic ''[[Doctor Who]]'' would be available for viewers at launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a189515/seesaw-agrees-bbc-worldwide-deal.html| title=SeeSaw agrees BBC Worldwide deal| publisher=[[Digital Spy]]| date=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/dec/02/seesaw-bbc-worldwide-deal| title=SeeSaw signs BBC Worldwide deal| publisher=[[The Guardian]]| date=2009-12-02 | location=London | first=Chris | last=Tryhorn | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 January 2010, SeeSaw announced several deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a200212/seesaw-announces-more-content-deals.html| title=SeeSaw announces more content deals| publisher=[[Digital Spy]]| date=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/29/seesaw-footballers-wives-the-apprentice| title=SeeSaw online TV service gains The Apprentice and Footballers' Wives| publisher=[[The Guardian]]| date=2010-01-29 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; SeeSaw would carry programmes from Channel 4, including shows such as ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'', ''[[The Inbetweeners]]'', ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'' and ''[[Grand Designs]]'' and also from [[Five (TV channel)|Five]], including programmes such as ''[[The Gadget Show]]'', ''[[Neighbours]]'' and ''[[Home and Away]]''. SeeSaw reached a separate agreement with UK independent distributor Digital Rights Group, which resulted in [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] dramas, such as ''[[Doc Martin]]'' and ''[[Kingdom (2007 TV series)|Kingdom]]'' being made available. SeeSaw also agreed separate deals with independent production firm [[Shed Media]] (through its distribution arm [[Outright Distribution]]) and [[Talkback Thames]] for a variety of programming including ''[[Footballers' Wives]],'' ''[[Bad Girls (TV series)|Bad Girls]]'', ''[[Waterloo Road (TV series)|Waterloo Road]]'' and ''[[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]]''. In addition, the firm agreed the "first of many" planned US content deals with [[RHI Entertainment]] for 50 made-for-TV movies.

SeeSaw launched to the public on 17 February 2010 with over 3,000 hours of free content, supported by 60-second pre and mid-roll advertising.&lt;ref name="Launch" /&gt; June 2010 saw the addition of a pay-per-programme feature, with a 48-hour viewing window.&lt;ref name="Launch2"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2010/feb/18/seesaw-video-on-demand| title=Will SeeSaw's business model work?| publisher=[[The Guardian]]| date=2010-02-18 | location=London | first=Maggie | last=Brown | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May 2010, SeeSaw launched its paid-for service offering 1,000 hours of premium content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a220854/seesaw-premium-service-goes-live.html| title=SeeSaw premium service goes live| publisher=[[Digital Spy]]| date=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform had already agreed a deal with [[MTV Networks]] for [[Comedy Central]] shows such as ''[[South Park]]'' and [[MTV]] properties such as ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'', ''[[My Super Sweet 16]]'' and ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County|Laguna Beach]]''. A range of BBC Worldwide shows were also available to rent, including ''[[The Royle Family]]'', ''[[Gavin &amp; Stacey]]'', ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'' and [[Louis Theroux]] documentaries. The firm said that "several" other agreements were in the pipeline with "major Hollywood studios" to offer around 2,000 hours of premium content in the coming months.

On 18 August 2010, SeeSaw agreed a content deal with [[NBC Universal Television Distribution]] to make shows such as ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', ''[[30 Rock]]'' and ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' available on its video on-demand website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a263381/seesaw-agrees-nbc-universal-deal.html| title=SeeSaw agrees NBC Universal deal| publisher=[[Digital Spy]]| date=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multi-year deal enabled SeeSaw users to rent individual episodes or full series of a range of US series, including ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' and ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''.

==Takeover==
On 19 January 2011, Arqiva announced plans to find an investment partner for SeeSaw, with options for a sale of the online TV service believed to be under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a298838/arqiva-seeks-partner-for-seesaw-venture.html| title=Arqiva seeks partner for SeeSaw venture| publisher=[[Digital Spy]]| date=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arqiva completed a strategic review of SeeSaw in October 2010 and was seeking an investment partner to help with the "aim of accelerating the development of the service".

However, on 27 May 2011, an announcement on the SeeSaw blog confirmed that "next month will be the end of the road for SeeSaw",&lt;ref name="Closure 2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://blog.seesaw.com/2011/05/important-news-about-seesaw.html |title=Important News About Seesaw |publisher=SeeSaw |date=2011-05-27 |location=London |last=The SeeSaw team |accessdate=2011-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530022706/http://blog.seesaw.com/2011/05/important-news-about-seesaw.html |archivedate=30 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Arqiva directly announcing that SeeSaw would close on 20 June 2011, after failing to find an investment partner or buyer.&lt;ref name="Closure"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/27/seesaw-online-tv-venture-to-close| title=SeeSaw online TV venture to close | publisher=[[The Guardian]]| date=2011-05-27 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney | accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the site remained open, with Arqiva in talks to sell SeeSaw to US investment firm [[Criterion Capital Partners]],&lt;ref name="Seesawbuyout"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/21/seesaw-bebo-criterion-bought|title=SeeSaw targeted by Bebo buyers|last=Sweney|first=Mark|work=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=21 June 2011|location=London|date=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although only a limited selection of free content from BBC Worldwide, Channel 4 and Channel 5 remained available. On 14 July 2011, it was announced that a consortium of investors, including Criterion Capital Partners, had purchased a 75% stake in SeeSaw for more than £10m.&lt;ref name="Seesawbuyout2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/news/1080121/Bebo-owner-buys-SeeSaw-10m/|title=Bebo owner buys SeeSaw for more than £10m|last=McCabe|first=Maisie|work=Media Week|accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arqiva retained a 25% stake, while Criterion Media Group, a division of Criterion Capital Partners, took majority ownership of SeeSaw. Criterion Capital Partners said the deal pulled together a number of investors: entertainment executives, new media entrepreneurs, institutional funds, and private equity partners.

As part of the deal, Criterion was required to raise a multimillion-pound round of funding to drive the rejuvenation of SeeSaw and set up its 28 staff in new headquarters by 31 August.&lt;ref name="SeeSaw loses Channel 4"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/01/seesaw-channel-4|title=SeeSaw loses Channel 4 shows in funding hitch|last=Sweney|first=Mark|work=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=1 September 2011|location=London|date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Criterion's plan to bring profitability was to renegotiate nearly 20 programme content deals. However SeeSaw failed to renegotiate its content deals with Channel 4 and Channel 5, losing two of its key partners.&lt;ref name="Execs Leave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SeeSaw loses Channel 4" /&gt; In September 2011 Criterion was understood to have run into problems with the lead backer in the investment consortium, Weston Capital.&lt;ref name="Jackson walks away"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/02/michael-jackson-seesaw|title=Michael Jackson walks away from SeeSaw|last=Sweney|first=Mark|work=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=2 September 2011|location=London|date=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delay meant that Arqiva was no longer contractually bound to run the venture, including providing ongoing funding. However the company and its remaining 15 members of staff were able to move out of Arqiva into a new office.&lt;ref name="Execs Leave" /&gt;

On 28 October 2011 SeeSaw was closed down after investors failed to provide the committed funding. Any users visiting the SeeSaw website are told "Thanks for your support but SeeSaw is no longer available."&lt;ref name="SeeSaw Shuts PCUK"&gt;{{cite news|last=Andrews|first=Robert|title=SeeSaw Shuts After Buy-Out Cash Fails To Arrive|url=http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-seesaw-shuts-after-buy-out-cash-fails-to-arrive/|accessdate=28 October 2011|newspaper=paidContent:UK|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been produced [[Off-Broadway]] at [[59E59 Theaters]] in 2014&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.59e59.org/moreinfo.php?showid=151 ''Woodsman'' (2014 production)], [[59E59 Theaters]] (accessed 2016-09-27).&lt;/ref&gt; and 2015,&lt;ref name="NYT2015"&gt;Laura Collins-Hughes, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/theater/the-woodsman-tells-the-tin-mans-tale.html "Led by a Tender Heart, Before It Is Ripped Out: ‘The Woodsman’ Tells the Tin Man’s Tale"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[New World Stages]] in 2016.&lt;ref name="NYT2016"&gt;Laura Collins-Hughes, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/22/theater/review-in-the-woodsman-a-love-lost-in-oz-under-a-witchs-spell.html "Review: In ‘The Woodsman,’ a Love Lost in Oz Under a Witch’s Spell"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The play has received critical praise, and won a 2016 [[Obie Award]] for Ortiz's puppet design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obieawards.com/events/year-2016/ 2016 Obie Award winners], accessed 2016-09-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zoe Beery, [http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/the-tin-man-of-oz-gets-a-refit-in-the-woodsman-8652154 "The Tin Man of Oz Gets a Refit in 'The Woodsman'"], ''[[The Village Voice]]'', May 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 2, 2016, a filmed performance of the work was broadcast by [[PBS]] stations, as part of the ''Theater Close-Up'' series produced by [[WNET]] in association with [[BroadwayHD]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thirteen.org/uncategorized/theater-close-woodsman/ "Theater Close-Up: The Woodsman"], [[WNET]] (accessed 2016-09-27).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The play focuses on the story of [[Nick Chopper]], a mortal woodsman who falls in love with a young woman whose guardian is the [[Wicked Witch of the East]]. (The witch's rule has made everyone afraid to speak aloud, so people mainly communicate in noises.) The witch curses his axe and he begins to lose pieces of himself.  As he falls apart, he is replaced piece by piece with metal, while trying to hold on to his love and identity.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;Marilyn Stasio, [https://variety.com/2016/legit/reviews/the-woodsman-review-play-1201700228/ "Off Broadway Review: Oz Backstory ‘The Woodsman’"], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', February 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[New York Times]]'' critic Laura Collins-Hughes praised the 2015 production, especially for Hardy's music and for Ortiz's puppet design, while noting that the visual, nonverbal storytelling of the hour-long production was not always clear to the audience.&lt;ref name="NYT2015"/&gt;  Collins-Hughes found the 2016 production to be less rushed and "more assured", with an increased "visual lushness", but felt that "mechanics get in the way of fantasy" during part of the show.&lt;ref name="NYT2016"/&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'''s Marilyn Stasio cited the production's "haunting beauty", while Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' described the "charming and disturbing", minimalist production as the antithesis of ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'', the massively successful big-budget Oz-based musical playing a block away.&lt;ref name="THR"/&gt;

The '''Trinidad &amp; Tobago Film Company Limited (FilmTT)''' '''i'''s the [[Government agency|state agency]] established in 2006 to facilitate the growth and development of the film and audio-visual sector in [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad &amp; Tobago]]. As a [[subsidiary]] of the Trinidad and Tobago Creative Industries Company Limited, FilmTT works on all aspects of film sector development, promotes Trinidad &amp; Tobago as a film production location, and provides Film Commission services to local and incoming productions. FilmTT’s mission is to maximise the economic and creative potential of Trinidad and Tobago’s screen industries for the benefit of the country and its people.

** Champion the film industry’s potential to diversify the economy and contribute to GDP to Government, investors, service suppliers, local and international partner agencies, and industry stakeholders.

FilmTT came under the purview of the [[Trinidad and Tobago Creative Industries Company]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film, music and fashion to fall under Creative TT|url=http://www.news.gov.tt/archive/index.php?news=13024|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917144637/http://www.news.gov.tt/archive/index.php?news=13024|archivedate=2016-09-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film Commission Services==

===Industry Liaison ===
FilmTT is responsible for coordinating the necessary permits for crews to film. As a state agency, FilmTT organizes with various ministries within the government for clearance for various aspects of the production process. 

===Location Scouting===
FilmTT researches and proposes a range of locations in and around Trinidad and Tobago to production crews for filming. The agency executes the legal negotiations involved in the acquisition of locations for filming.

==Projects/Initiatives==

===Producers Talk===
The inaugural installment of Producers Talk facilitated a conversation between FilmTT and the producers of the last three feature films in which the film company invested both grant and equity funds – ''Moving Parts'' (2018) by Emilie Upczak, Play the Devil (2016) by Maria Govan (represented by producer Abigail Hadeed), and The Cutlass (2016) by Darisha Beresford (represented by producer Teneille Newallo). The intention was for the first-time producers to share information about their experiences producing these films with an audience of other producers, directors, production crew, and other members of the film producing community.

Topics included sales and distribution, exhibition, filming in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and funding, among others.

===Film Festival Season ===
Film Festival Season is an annual film industry event that occurs from September – November when Trinidad and Tobago's three major film festivals take place - trinidad+tobago film festival (ttff), Animae Caribe Animation and Digital Media Festival and Green Screen Environmental Film Festival. In 2018, the season runs from 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; September to 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; November. 

For FilmTT, strategically investing in film festivals is one direct way of facilitating industry development, through structured, well-managed partnerships, while encouraging T&amp;T’s mass audience’s growing tastes for more indigenous content. As a strategic marketing communications campaign, Film Festival Season seeks to not only create greater awareness of the activities taking place within the film and animation sectors, but also to create a sense of anticipation and pride in local creative products.

=== Small Marketing and Development Grants ===
In May 2017, FilmTT awarded small Film Marketing and Development Grants to nine T&amp;T filmmakers to advance their productions and careers. These grants are investments in the marketing and development of projects, including (but not limited to) attending regional or international film festivals, markets, incubators, labs or workshops. All projects will take place during the period May 1 – December 31, 2017. Based on evaluation, the following projects were selected to receive Government funding:

The '''Xeric Foundation''' is a private, nonprofit corporation based in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], which for twenty years [[List of Xeric grant winners|awarded self-publishing grants]] to [[comic book]] creators, as well as qualified charitable and [[nonprofit]] organizations. The Xeric Foundation was established by [[Peter Laird]], co-creator of the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.

== Mission and operation ==
Laird founded the Foundation after considerable thought, as "an appropriate way to give back something extra to the comics world," by providing grants for self-publishers.&lt;ref name="Rebels"&gt;Wiater, Stanley &amp; Bissette, Stephen R. (ed.s) ''Comic Book Rebels: Conversations with the Creators of the New Comics'' (Donald I. Fine, Inc. 1993) {{ISBN|1-55611-355-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Laird stated that the Xeric Foundation is "actually two foundations in one. One half of it is for charitable organizations, and the other half is for creators who want to [[self-publish]] their comics."&lt;ref name="Rebels"/&gt; That latter half being what the foundation is best known for.&lt;ref name="Rebels"/&gt;

=== Self-publishing grants ===
The Xeric Foundation supported work of an [[Alternative comics|alternative]] or non-"mainstream" nature, reasoning that if a comic had strong commercial appeal, it would be picked up by one of the major publishers. The Foundation was an extremely valuable supporter of "art for art's sake" comics, and helped launch the careers of a number of "literary" cartoonists.&lt;ref name=comicsalliance /&gt;

The Foundation assisted comic book creators with some of the costs in self-publishing their work; it was not the Foundation's intention to fully support an artist/writer through the entire process of self-publishing, but rather to encourage creators to experience the learning process involved in working towards such a goal.

The creative side of the Foundation involved the usual application process, but in addition, the Foundation began with "an advisory committee made up of three ... people working in the industry" whose input is sought on how best to proceed with each application.&lt;ref name="Rebels"/&gt; Submissions were evaluated prior to Laird's involvement, and then he made the ultimate decisions based on their recommendations.&lt;ref name="Rebels"/&gt;

== History ==
Laird founded the Xeric Foundation in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Laird Starts Artist-Aid Foundation," ''The Comics Journal'' #151 (July 1992), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; the name "originat[ing] out of a [[Scrabble]] game with [Laird's] brother Don," "'''Xeric'''" simply being "a word [he] like[d]," ostensibly meaning "[[Xeric|dry and desertlike]]" — but which ultimately "has absolutely no direct connection with the foundation."&lt;ref name="Rebels"/&gt;

The Foundation's first grant cycle was in September 1992,&lt;ref&gt;[http://xericfoundation.org/index.html Xeric Foundation website.] Retrieved July 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; with the first recipients being [[Robert Eaton (comics)|Robert Eaton]], [[Michael Kasper]], [[Jeff Nicholson]], and [[Wayne Wise]] &amp; [[Fred Wheaton]].

In 1993 Laird discussed the Foundation's projected lifespan:

{{quote|... knock on wood, God willing, and [[the creek don't rise]], if we go on for another couple of decades, and I'm able to put more money into the basic funding of the Xeric Foundation, then the amount of money that can be given out can really be raised significantly.&lt;ref name="Rebels"/&gt;}}

He hoped that ultimately the figure can be raised from "thousands of dollars" to "hundreds of thousands of dollars," to support an increasing number of large and small projects.&lt;ref name="Rebels"/&gt;

In July 2011, the Foundation announced it would no longer award publishing grants, instead, focusing on charitable work, including fostering environmentalism, literacy, and the arts.&lt;ref name=comicsalliance&gt;{{cite web|last=Goellner|first=Caleb|title=After 20 Years The Xeric Foundation Ends Cartooning Grants, Shifts Focus to Charity|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/07/18/xeric-foundation-ends-comic-grants/#ixzz1Sa9TRsOv|publisher=Comics Alliance|date=July 18, 2011|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the changing nature of the comics industry, and specifically the ability of cartoonists to publish their work online, founder Laird announced the shift.&lt;ref name="changedfocus" /&gt; According to the organization's website, one round of final grants will be awarded in 2012, giving applicants until May 2012 to complete their work.&lt;ref name="changedfocus"&gt;Laird, Peter. [http://www.xericfoundation.org/xernews.html "The Xeric Foundation's upcoming 20th anniversary will bring a changed focus in grant-giving,"] Xeric Foundation (July 14, 2011). Accessed July 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; (The Foundation cancelled the scheduled November 2011 review.)&lt;ref name="changedfocus" /&gt;

Altogether, the Xeric Foundation has awarded in excess of $2,500,000 since its first grant cycle.&lt;ref name=comicsalliance /&gt;
