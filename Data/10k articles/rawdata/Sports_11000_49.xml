The '''2008 Milan–San Remo''' [[cycling race]] took place on March 22, 2008, and was won by [[Fabian Cancellara]]. It was the 99th edition of the [[Milan–San Remo]] [[classic cycle races|monument classic]]. It was three&amp;nbsp;kilometres longer than 2007, at 298&amp;nbsp;km, following the addition of the Le Mànie climb, which was due to roadworks along the previously planned route. The race concluded on Lungomare Italo Calvino and not on the traditional Via Roma due to construction and the Easter weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2008/mar08/mar06news2 |title='Maniac' enters Milano-San Remo |date=2008-03-06 |accessdate=2008-03-21 |work=cyclingnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 it posted the best record in the [[Úrvalsdeild karla (handball)|Úrvalsdeild karla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Akureyri deildarmeistari |url=http://www.visir.is/section/MEDIA99&amp;fileid=VTVFEF16DEF-BD67-42B4-B2A3-17C6A3CC1E96 |accessdate=25 July 2018 |work=[[Vísir.is]] |date=29 March 2011 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Ívar Benediktsson |title=Akureyri er deildarmeistari |url=https://www.mbl.is/frettir/forsida/2011/03/28/akureyri_er_deildarmeistari/ |accessdate=25 July 2018 |work=[[Morgunblaðið]] |date=28 March 2011 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It made it to the 2011 Úrvalsdeild finals where it lost to [[FH Hafnarfjördur|FH]] in front of a record crowd of 2950 people in [[Kaplakriki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FH Íslandsmeistari|url=http://www.ruv.is/frett/fh-islandsmeistari|accessdate=11 February 2018|work=[[RÚV]]|date=4 May 2011|language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the club was relegated from the Úrvalsdeild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Arnar Geir Halldórsson |title=Akureyri átt handboltalið í efstu deild síðustu 33 ár |url=http://www.kaffid.is/akureyri-att-handboltalid-efstu-deild-sidustu-33-ar/ |accessdate=25 July 2018 |work=kaffid.is |date=4 April 2017 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly after, KA decided to break off from the cooperation and fielded their own team starting from 2017-2018.

[[File:Manuel argues with umpire.jpg|thumb|[[Charlie Manuel]] discusses a call with umpire [[Fieldin Culbreth]].]]In [[baseball]], an '''appeal play''' occurs when a member of the defensive team calls the attention of an [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] to an infraction which he would otherwise ignore.

==Appeal play situations==
A runner shall be called [[out (baseball)|out]], after a successful live ball appeal, if he:
* failed to [[tag up]] on a batted ball caught in-flight,
* failed to touch a base the last time he passed it, or
* failed to touch all previous bases in order
To properly execute a live ball appeal, a fielder must, with a [[live ball (baseball)|live ball]], tag the runner or base in question and communicate to the umpire what the infraction was and which runner committed the infraction. Such communication may be non-verbal, implicit, or assumed—so long as the intent of the fielder is clear to the umpire. Contrary to popular belief, an appeal out is not a [[force play|force out]] unless it is regarding a missed [[force base]]. For example, if a runner from third base [[tag up|tags up]] and scores, but a runner from second base leaves too early, failing to tag up, and then is put out on the appeal, the run counts if it was scored before the appeal by the fielders. Rare situations with a viable appeal on a runner who misses his [[force base]] require the umpire to recognize an apparent [[fourth out]].

==Legal and viable appeals==
Fielders have the right to appeal any runner at any base he has reached or passed, at any time while the ball is alive, subject to the following restrictions:
* No live ball appeal may occur on a runner who misses home base (when not forced) and immediately attempts to correct his mistake; this runner must be [[tag out|tagged]] in order to be put out. (In running or sliding for home base, the runner fails to touch home base and makes no attempt to return to the base, appeal can be made and touching home base will suffice.)
* When a running infraction occurs and then all playing action becomes relaxed, any live ball appeal must occur before the next pitch, play, or attempted play. An appeal itself does not count as an attempted play for the purposes of subsequent appeals.
* Once a fielder properly executes a legal live ball appeal on a runner, that runner may not again be appealed at that base, even if the appeal is for a different reason.

An appeal is ''legal'' if the fielder 
* has the right to appeal a runner at a base,
* clearly communicates to the umpire what the infraction was, ''and''
* tags the runner or base in question with a live ball.

Umpires will only rule on legal appeals. A potential appeal is ''viable'' if the appeal is legal and the umpire knows that the runner has indeed committed an infraction and will be called out if the appeal is executed by a fielder.

==Example: Multiple appeals==
Suppose that runners are on first and third base, and the batter hits a fly ball. The runner on third tags up, leaving third base immediately after the outfielder touches the ball. The runner seems to score, beating the throw home, but failing to touch home plate. He proceeds into his dugout without again attempting to touch home base. The runner on first base stays at first base, and action becomes relaxed while the ball is in the infield. 

The fielders now suspect that the runner left third base too early and also missed the plate. Suppose that a fielder, with the live ball, touches third base and tells the nearest umpire, "I think he left too early." This is a proper legal appeal, and the umpire should rule with a safe signal, perhaps saying, "No, he was fine." Now no legal appeal may again occur on that runner at third base. Suppose then that a fielder, with the live ball, touches home base and says to the nearest umpire, "I think he never touched home." This is a legal and viable appeal, and so the umpire should call the runner out and direct that his run shall not count. 

Since the ball was live (and indeed must be for appeals to be legal), the runner from first could have attempted to advance at any time during the appeals. If the defense attempts to play on that runner, their opportunity to appeal the runner from third base is lost, and the run would count regardless of any subsequent attempt to appeal.

==Other appeals==
A member of the defensive team may appeal to the umpire when a batter [[batting out of turn|bats out of turn]]. The umpire then enforces the penalty for batting out of turn, if any. The ball must be live for this as for any appeal. After the appeal is made, the umpire will usually signal "Time" and figure out whether the appeal is successful.

When a batter appears to have swung at a pitch, but the [[Umpire (baseball)|plate umpire]] calls it a [[ball (baseball statistics)|ball]], a member of the defensive team (by rule the [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] or [[catcher]], though the [[pitcher]] often appeals and is usually recognized) may appeal for information from a [[Umpire (baseball)|base umpire]] with a better view of the pitch on whether the batter swung. The field umpire then signals whether the batter swung, and such a judgment must, by rule, prevail. The umpire asked is usually the first-base umpire (or third-base, if the batter is left-handed). The plate umpire is not required to ask for assistance if he believes the request is making a farce of the game. If the bat barely left the shoulder of the batter and the catcher appeals the "no-swing" call, the umpire will probably deny the appeal. This procedure was introduced because it is commonplace for a plate umpire to be unable to see some swings. A manager may ask an umpire to request assistance on other plays where another umpire had a better view, but the umpire is not required to do so. Such requests are common when a close [[home run]] or [[foul ball]] call is disputed, or when determining the accuracy of a close [[Catch (baseball)|catch]] or no catch call. 

An appeal may be executed if a [[fair ball]] becomes dead by leaving the playing field or becoming unplayable ([[home run]], [[ground rule double]], wild throw into stands/dugout, stuck in fence) if the defense believes a baserunner failed to touch a base before touching the next base to which he is entitled. For example, if the batter hits a ball which goes over the outfield fence in fair territory (whether a home run or ground rule double) but fails to touch first base before touching second base, he may not return to first base to correct his mistake once he has touched second, and he is out at first base if the defensive team appeals. In such a case, the plate umpire would put a new ball in play, and after the ball became live by rule, the defense could appeal the missed base. Again, the ball must be live.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/07_the_runner.pdf Divisions Of The Code&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In U.S. high school games or other games governed by [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] rules, the defense may execute any of the live ball appeals above during a [[dead ball (baseball)|dead ball]] by simply communicating the infraction to the umpire, so it is never necessary to attempt a live ball appeal; it is always safer for the defense to ask for [[time (baseball)|time]] to make the ball dead, and then make any requests to the umpire.

[[File:Sanjev Rajaram Assist.gif|thumb|A shot taken from a pass that if successful would count as an assist for the passer]]
In [[basketball]], an '''assist''' is attributed to a player who passes the ball to a teammate in a way that leads to a score by [[field goal (basketball)|field goal]], meaning that he or she was "assisting" in the basket. There is some judgment involved in deciding whether a passer should be credited with an assist. An assist can be scored for the passer even if the player who receives the pass makes a basket after dribbling the ball. However, the original definition of an assist did not include such situations,&lt;ref&gt;Hal Bock, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20020428/ai_n10784766 Give an assist to NBA]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}, ''The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'', April 28, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; so the comparison of assist statistics across eras is a complex matter.

Only the pass directly before the score may be counted as an assist, so no more than one assist can be recorded per field goal (unlike in other sports, such as [[ice hockey]]). A pass that leads to a shooting foul and scoring by [[free throws]] does not count as an assist in the [[NBA]], but does in [[FIBA]] play (only one assist is awarded per set of free throws in which at least one free throw is made).

[[Point guard]]s tend to get the most assists per game (apg), as their role is primarily that of a passer and ballhandler. 

[[Center (basketball)|Centers]] tend to get fewer assists, but centers with good floor presence and court vision can dominate a team by assisting. Being inside the key, the center often has the best angles and the best position for "dishes" and other short passes in the scoring area. Center [[Wilt Chamberlain]] led the NBA in assists in 1968. A strong center with inside-scoring prowess, such as former NBA center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], can also be an effective assistor because the defense's [[Double team|double-teaming]] tends to open up offense in the form of shooters.

The NBA single-game assist team record is 53, held by the Milwaukee Bucks, on December 26, 1978.&lt;ref name=nba.com&gt;{{cite web | title=Regular Season Records: Assists| website = NBA.com | publisher = NBA Media Ventures, LLC |url=http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_assists.html| accessdate=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBA single-game assist individual record is 30, held by [[Scott Skiles]] of the Orlando Magic on December 30, 1990.

The NBA record for most career assists is held by [[John Stockton]], with 15,806, Stockton also holds the NBA single season assist per game record with 14.5 during the 1989-1990 regular season.  The highest career assist per game average in NBA history is held by [[Magic Johnson]], with 11.2 assist per game.

The '''Authorized Protective Eyewear List (APEL)''' is a list of [[Eye protection|protective eyewear]] tested and approved by the [[U.S. Military]] for use by its soldiers. It was created in 2006 because statistics showed that about 10% of battlefield injuries at that time included eye injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wamc.amedd.army.mil/Documents/AUTHORIZEDPROTECTIVEEYEWEARLISTOCT2006v2.pdf APEL list with details as of October, 2006.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131075546/http://www.wamc.amedd.army.mil/Documents/AUTHORIZEDPROTECTIVEEYEWEARLISTOCT2006v2.pdf |date=January 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''APEL''' is updated periodically and there are usually more than a dozen types of non-prescription and prescription spectacles and goggles on the list for different duty situations and soldier preferences. In 2010, the '''APEL''' was placed under the oversight of the Military Combat Eyewear Protection (MCEP) program under the office of [[PEO Soldier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/pmice/IndustryInfo/APBIMay10/Army_Eyewear_MCEP_2010.pdf PEO Soldier Military Combat Eye Protection (MCEP) Program]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and selection==
Soldiers serve in different situations with different types of risk for eye injury, from ballistic projectiles to fragments to dust and sand in addition to ultraviolet light and laser light. Therefore, the APEL includes spectacles and goggles optimized for different situations. The APEL also includes different styles to accommodate soldier preferences, with the goal of increasing the use of eye protection. Approved protective eyewear includes both military standard and commercial styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.health.mil/Libraries/101101_TCCC_Course_Materials/0504-PEO-Soldier-Authorized-Protective-Eyewear-List-poster-110620.pdf |title=APEL summary poster 2010 |access-date=2012-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119071858/http://health.mil/Libraries/101101_TCCC_Course_Materials/0504-PEO-Soldier-Authorized-Protective-Eyewear-List-poster-110620.pdf |archive-date=2011-11-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some styles can accommodate prescription lenses. Several types of goggles are available because they are optimized for certain purposes, such as regular use, use in vehicles, or use with [[Night vision device|night vision goggles]]. Some fit over regular eyeglasses, some can accommodate prescription lenses, and others are designed for those who do not wear eyeglasses.&lt;ref&gt;

==Performance==
Eyewear that is put on the APEL must first meet the standards established by the Army Vision Conservation and Readiness Program. For ballistic resistance, this program requires that eyewear meet the current [[Ballistic eye wear#Performance standards|ANSI Z87 civilian standard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/p40_506.pdf The Army Vision Conservation and Readiness Program] Department of the (U.S.) Army, 2009, pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Then the U.S. military standard (MIL-PRF-31013) must also be met.

The U.S. civilian standard for protective eyewear was revised in 2010. The previous version from 2003 was organized by the type of protector. The Z87.1-2010 version is organized by the type of hazard such as droplet and splash, impact, optical radiation, dust, fine dust, and mist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domesticpreparedness.com/userfiles/reports/MSA_ANSI-ISEA10.pdf ANSI/ISEA Z87.1-2010: Frequently Asked Questions about the New Standard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426011928/http://www.domesticpreparedness.com/userfiles/reports/MSA_ANSI-ISEA10.pdf |date=2012-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the 2003 version specified that protective products be marked as providing “Basic” or “High Impact” protection. In the Z87.1-2010 standard, there is no longer a distinction between levels of ballistic protection. Products are either non-impact or impact protectors. Products marked as impact protectors must pass all high-impact testing requirements and are marked as “Z87+”. Non-impact protectors are those which do not pass all high-impact testing requirements and are therefore marked only with “Z87” (no “+” sign).

The U.S. military standard (MIL-PRF-31013), requires (at a minimum) that [[Ballistic eye wear|ballistic eyewear]] can always withstand a 0.15 caliber, 5.8 grain, T37 shaped projectile at a velocity of 640 to 660 feet per second (approximately 3.8&amp;nbsp;mm 0.376 g at a velocity of 195 – 201&amp;nbsp;m/s). Goggles are required to stop a 17-grain fragment simulating projectile moving at a speed of 550 feet per second (approximately twice the energy impact of spectacles). For testing, the velocity of the projectile must be verified using sound or optical chronograph methods. The eyewear is put on an Alderson 50th percentile male headform. A 0.002&amp;nbsp; inch thick aluminum foil “witness sheet” is placed behind the area of impact. This sheet shows whether any small pieces penetrate or come off of the eyewear during the test. The eyewear being tested is hit one time straight on slightly toward the outside of the center of the lens. The eyewear fails the test if the aluminum foil witness sheet is punctured or if the eyewear is cracked.

In addition to ballistic performance, the U.S. military standard includes requirements for optical clarity, protection from UV rays, fit, chemical resistance, and environmental stability (properties won’t be changed by exposure to a range of temperatures or levels of humidity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-PRF/MIL-PRF-030000-79999/MIL-PRF-31013_20540/ MIL-PRF-31013] Performance Specification: Spectacles, Special Protective Eyewear Cylindrical System (SPECS), 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Though soldiers are increasingly exposed to explosive threats, there is currently no testing or performance requirements for blast resistance of approved eyewear.

A '''bobblehead''', also known as a '''nodder''', '''wobbler''' or '''bobble head''', is a type of [[Collectable|collectible]] [[doll]]. Its head is often oversized compared to its body. Instead of a solid connection, its head is connected to the body by a spring or hook&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A370126|title=h2g2 - Nodding Dogs - Edited Entry|author=Not Panicking Ltd|date=2 January 2012|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in such a way that a light tap will cause the head to bobble, hence the name.

==History==
During the seventeenth-century, figurines of Buddha and other religious figures called "temple nodders" were produced in Asia.&lt;ref name=Hoffman&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bV9HAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT22|page=22|title=Dictionary of Toys and Games in American Popular Culture|author=Frank Hoffmann, Frederick J Augustyn, Jr, and Martin J Manning|publisher=Routledge|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known Western reference to a bobblehead is thought to be in [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s 1842 short story "[[The Overcoat (short story)|The Overcoat]]", in which the main character's neck was described as "like the necks of plaster cats which wag their heads".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oBXBDBe1knoC&amp;pg=PT205|page=205|title=The 34-Ton Bat: The Story of Baseball as Told Through Bobbleheads, Cracker Jacks, Jockstraps, Eye Black, and 375 Other Strange and Unforgettable Objects|author=Steve Rushin|publisher=Little Brown|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the nineteenth-century, bisque-based bobbleheads were being made in limited quantities for the US market.&lt;ref name=Hoffman /&gt; Many of the bobbleheads in the US were produced in Germany, with an uptick in imports during the 1920s and 30s.&lt;ref name=McClelland&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/features_entertainment/jean-mcclelland-bobblehead-figurines-a-fun-beginning-for-collectors/article_c14ff2de-ee16-57c3-bf00-71e5766f3775.html|publisher=Herald Dispatch|title=Bobblehead figurines a fun beginning for collectors |date=February 7, 2016|author=Jean McClelland}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1950s, bobbleheads had a substantial surge in popularity, with items made of either plastic or bisque.&lt;ref name=Hoffman /&gt;

By 1960, [[Major League Baseball]] had gotten in on the action and produced a series of [[Papier-mâché]] bobblehead dolls, one for each team, all with the same cherubic face, and a few select players over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/espn/wire/_/section/mlb/id/3028949 |publisher=ESPN |author=Associated Press |title=Bobblehead collection SRO at Minute Maid Park |date=September 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Series]] held that year brought the first player-specific baseball bobbleheads, for [[Roberto Clemente]], [[Mickey Mantle]], [[Roger Maris]], and [[Willie Mays]], still all with the same face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/294074111.html|title=Bobbleheads signify a dream come true for Brewers|author=Blane Ferguson|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next decade bobbleheads were also created with ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidseideman/2015/06/03/record-price-for-bobbing-head-doll-60k-leaves-collectors-shaking-their-heads/#3346254aa6a2|publisher=Forbes Magazine|date=June 3, 2015 |title=Record Price For Vintage Yankees Bobbing Head Doll, $60k, Signals Hot Memorabilia Market |author=David Seineman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few years, they would be produced for other sports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.mcall.com/2007-09-25/features/3777764_1_bobblehead-doll-collectors|date=September 25, 2007|title=A big $500 nod for 1962 football bobblehead doll|author=Harry Rinker|publisher=The Morning Call}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as cartoon characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQtTF0CAq7AC&amp;pg=PA193|page=193|title=The Baseball Fan's Bucket List: 162 Things You Must Do, See, Get, and Experience Before You Die|author=Robert Santelli, Jenna Santelli|publisher=Running Press|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous bobbleheads of all time also hails from this era: [[The Beatles]] bobblehead set,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gee0Bb0sKAC&amp;pg=PA38|page=39|title=Warman's Beatles Field Guide: Values and Identification|author=Tim Neely|publisher=Krause Publications|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a valuable collectible today.&lt;ref name=McClelland /&gt;

The next increase in popularity took place during the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbTUorcuXkoC&amp;pg=PA47|page=47|title=Toys and American Culture: An Encyclopedia|author=Sharon M. Scott|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although older bobbleheads like the baseball teams and The Beatles were sought after by collectors during this period, new bobblehead dolls were few and far between. What finally prompted their resurgence was cheaper manufacturing processes, and the main bobblehead material switched, this time from ceramic to plastic. It was now possible to make bobbleheads in the very limited numbers necessary for them to be viable collectibles. On Aug. 2, 1997, the minor league [[Birmingham Barons]] gave away Barons Bobblehead Doll bobbleheads at a game.&lt;ref&gt;Ticket Information, Birmingham News, Apr. 3, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The first major league baseball team to offer a bobblehead giveaway was the [[San Francisco Giants]], which distributed 35,000 Willie Mays head nodders at their May 9, 1999 game.[http://www.bobbleheadhall.com/portfolio-view/willie-mays-1999-giants-giveaway/13]

The variety of bobbleheads has grown to include even relatively obscure popular culture figures and notable people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/local/columnists/daniel-finney/2016/10/14/iowa-man-can-put-your-face-bobblehead/91843544/|publisher=The Des Moines Register|title=This Iowa man can put your face on a bobblehead|author=Daniel P.

Thanjavur dolls are a type of Indian bobblehead dolls known as "Thanjavur Thalayatti Bommai" in the [[Tamil language]], meaning "Tanjore Head-Shaking Doll". They are a native art form in the [[Thanjavur]] region of [[Tamil Nadu]] state in [[South India]]. These dolls are usually 6" to 12" tall (15 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm). They are made of clay or wood and painted over in bright colors, and are often dressed up in fancy clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/316015/elegance-motion.html|publisher=Deccan Herald|title=Elegance in motion|author=Trisha Bhattacharya|date=March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They form a part of an elaborate display of dolls known as "[[Golu]] (kolu)", exhibited in Indian houses during the "[[Navratri|Dasara]] (Navaratri)" festival in Sep-Oct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/twin-treat-for-the-chennaiities/article7636917.ece|publisher=The Hindu|title=Heralding Navaratri|author=Lalithaa Krishnan|date=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In pop culture==
* Sports teams sometimes give away bobbleheads at their games, for example the [[Los Angeles Kings]] gave away some honoring [[Luc Robitaille]] on his induction to the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kings.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=508310|title=Practice Your Bobble!|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1986 "[[Let's Go Mets Go|Let's Go Mets]]" music video, there is a scene where [[Joe Piscopo]], standing outside the [[New York Mets]]' dugout at [[Shea Stadium]], taps four Mets bobblehead dolls, then goes into the dugout and taps the heads of four actual Mets players ([[Howard Johnson (baseball)|Howard Johnson]], [[Bob Ojeda]], [[Rick Aguilera]], [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]]) who "bobble" their heads in a similar fashion.  Piscopo then attempts to tap a fifth player ([[Lee Mazzilli]]) but is rebuffed and subsequently tackled by all of the players.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N4VIXM1RJk.  Bobblehead sequence begins at 2:15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2001, [[Audi]] broadcast commercials in Europe featuring an Elvis impersonator and a [[prototypical]] [[Wackel-Elvis]] ("Wobble Elvis" or "Wobbly Elvis") dashboard figure with a wobbling left arm and hip. Due to subsequent demand 165,000 Wackel-Elvis dashboard figures were produced. The figure depicts Elvis wearing the jumpsuit he wore in the 1973 [[Aloha from Hawaii]] TV broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article456186/Wackel_Elvis_von_Audi_Fans_stehen_Schlange.html Fans Waiting in Line for Release of Wackel-Elvis, 06/11/2001, ''Die Welt'' (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQo95oI4nXY|title=Elvis Audi Werbung|date=26 May 2008|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1czNu9pTzM|title=Wackel Elvis|date=22 July 2007|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Carol Eckman Award''' is an award given annually since 1986 to the women's [[college basketball]] coach that "best demonstrates the character of the late [[Carol Eckman]], the mother of the collegiate women's basketball national championship". Given by the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association#Coaches Awards|Women's Basketball Coaches Association]] (WBCA), the award is named for former women's [[head coach]] Carol Eckman, best known for establishing in 1969 the first National Invitational Women's Intercollegiate Basketball Tournament.&lt;ref name="Miller2002"/&gt;

Eckman, who served as head coach at West Chester State College, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Lock Haven State College, started the national tournament while at West Chester State College. She started the sixteen team tournament in 1969. Eckman invited 15 teams to the West Chester campus, charging each $25 to cover officials and awards.&lt;ref name="VanDerveer"&gt;{{harvnb|VanDerveer|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tournament served as a springboard for the formation of the [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women|AIAW]] two years later, which administered national championships for many sports, including basketball, from 1971 until 1982, when the NCAA became involved in women's sports.&lt;ref name="Ikard2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieberman-ClineRoberts1996"/&gt;

The criteria for the award include:&lt;ref name=WBCA/&gt;

'''Charles Sackville, 2nd Duke of Dorset''' &lt;small&gt;[[Privy Council of Great Britain|PC]]&lt;/small&gt; (6 February 1711 &amp;ndash; 5 January 1769), styled as the '''Earl of Middlesex''' from 1720 until 1765, was a British nobleman, politician, opera impresario and [[cricket]]er.  He was styled Lord Buckhurst from 1711 to 1720 and Earl of Middlesex from 1720 to 1765.

==Early life==
Sackville was the eldest son of [[Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset|Lionel Sackville, 7th Earl of Dorset]], created [[Duke of Dorset]] in 1720. He was educated at [[Westminster School]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], receiving an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|MA]] in 1730. He then embarked on a [[grand tour]] to Italy, which lasted from 1731 to 1733. While in [[Florence]] in 1733, he established the first [[Freemasonic]] lodge in all of Italy.

==Politics==
He was bitterly opposed, politically, to his father, and ventured to oppose his candidates in the boroughs he controlled. He became an ally of [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]]. In the [[British general election, 1734|1734 election]], he was defeated at [[Kent (UK Parliament constituency)|Kent]], but was returned as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East Grinstead (UK Parliament constituency)|East Grinstead]]. He was appointed Captain of [[Walmer Castle]] in September. He continued to sit for East Grinstead until 26 May 1741, when he accepted the office of High Steward of the Honour of [[Otford]].

He was returned for [[Sussex (UK Parliament constituency)|Sussex]] in a by-election in 1742, and for [[Old Sarum (UK Parliament constituency)|Old Sarum]] at the [[British general election, 1747|1747 election]]. He served as a [[Lord of the Treasury]] from 1743 until 1747, and was appointed a [[deputy lieutenant]] of [[Sussex]] on 20 October 1745. He was appointed [[Master of the Horse]] to the Prince of Wales in 1747, and served until Frederick's death in 1751. Middlesex married [[Grace Sackville, Countess of Middlesex|Hon. Grace Boyle]], daughter and heir of [[Richard Boyle, 2nd Viscount Shannon]], on 30 October 1744, but they had no children.

During the [[British general election, 1754|1754 election]], he unsuccessfully contested [[Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster]], and held no seat until the next election. He returned to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] as Member for East Grinstead from 1761 until 1765.

In that year, he succeeded his father as [[Duke of Dorset]], and also as [[Lord Lieutenant of Kent]], and was made a [[Privy Council of Great Britain|Privy Councillor]] in 1766. However, he did not long enjoy the ducal honours. Upon his death in 1769 in London, he was succeeded by his nephew, [[John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset|John Sackville]].

==Opera==

After a second [[grand tour]] to continental Europe in 1737 and 1738, he returned to England in January 1739 and staged an opera, [[Angelico e Medoro]], with music by [[Giovanni Battista Pescetti]] from a libretto by [[Metastasio]] at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]]. This was intended as a showcase for the (apparently limited) talents of the [[soprano]] [[Lucia Panichi]], ''La Muscovita'', who was Middlesex's mistress from about 1739 to about 1742. He also had the ambition to revive full-scale Italian opera in London, which [[John James Heidegger|Johann Jakob Heidegger]] had recently abandoned at the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre, Haymarket]] because of its expense. Middlesex staged a season in 1739–40 at the [[Haymarket Theatre|Little Theatre, Haymarket]], but he was unable to raise enough subscriptions to continue the next year. For the 1741–42 season he entered into partnership with seven other noblemen (the second [[Opera of the Nobility]]) and they were able to continue for three years at the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre, Haymarket.]]

==Cricket==
Like other members of his family, particularly his brother and his nephew, Sackville had an interest in [[cricket]] but did not achieve their level of involvement, probably because of his political activity.  He is known to have played for [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] during the [[1734 English cricket season]] in the match against [[Sussex county cricket teams|Sussex]] which is the earliest known game at [[Sevenoaks Vine]].&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;  His brother [[Lord John Sackville]] played alongside him for Kent, who won the game; and [[Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet|Sir William Gage]] played for Sussex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1731.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140105/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1731.html# |archive-date=29 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}.

The '''Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame''' (''Salón de la Fama del Béisbol Cubano'') is a [[hall of fame]] that honors eminent baseball players from Cuban baseball. Established in 1939 to honor players, managers, and umpires in the pre-[[Cuban revolution|revolution]] [[Cuban League]], by 1961 it had honored 68 players, managers, and umpires whose names are shown on a marble plaque at [[Havana]]'s [[Estadio Latinoamericano]].&lt;ref&gt;The name shown on the plaque in Havana is ''Salón de la Fama del Base-Ball Profesional de Cuba'' (Cuban Professional Baseball Hall of Fame) (see Alfonso 2007), but this longer name is not commonly used in histories of Cuban baseball.&lt;/ref&gt; After the revolution, however, the Hall of Fame languished for more than 50 years, seldom mentioned or acknowledged and with no new inductees. Following a campaign led by Cuban filmmaker [[Ian Padrón]], a meeting was held on November 7–8, 2014 to reformulate the Hall of Fame and to propose a museum in which it would be housed. The reformulated Hall recognized the original 68 members, and a jury of 25 people selected 10 new inductees—five from the pre-revolution period and five representing for the first time the post-revolution [[Cuban National Series]]. The planned site for the new museum is in the José Antonio Echeverría Workers' Social Club (also known as the Vedado Tennis Club).&lt;ref name="Refoundation"&gt;{{citation | last=Sené | first=Ismael | title=Refoundation of Cuba's Baseball Hall of Fame | date=12 February 2015 | website=oncubamagazine.com | publisher=OnCuba | url=http://oncubamagazine.com/sports/refoundation-of-cubas-baseball-hall-of-fame/ | access-date=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Pre-revolution (1939 to 1961)===
The Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame was established by the DGND (''Dirección General Nacional de Deportes''), a government agency supervising sports activities in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;González Echevarría 1999, pp. 205–206, 277.&lt;/ref&gt; The hall was inaugurated on July 26, 1939—about six weeks after the June 12 dedication and opening of the U.S. [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] in [[Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown]]—by placing a bronze plaque at Havana's [[La Tropical Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso 2007. González Echevarría 1999, p. 277. {{cite news | last=Brietz | first=Eddie | title=Stars Compete in Baseball Anniversary | newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] | page=6 | date=June 13, 1939 | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TY0vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6tsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6563,4875355 | accessdate=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ten inductees were selected by former and current baseball writers and the DGND's baseball advisers (''asesores de baseball''). The inaugural class included 19th-century Cuban stars ([[Antonio María García]], [[Valentín González (baseball)|Valentín González]], [[Adolfo Luján]], and [[Carlos Royer]]), black players who had achieved success in the U.S. [[Negro league baseball|Negro leagues]] ([[Luis Bustamante (baseball)|Luis Bustamante]], [[José Méndez|José de la Caridad Méndez]], [[Gervasio González]], and [[Cristóbal Torriente]]), and white players who had played [[Major League Baseball]] ([[Rafael Almeida]] and [[Armando Marsans]]).&lt;ref&gt;González Echevarría 1999, pp. 275, 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Méndez and Torriente, along with later inductee [[Martín Dihigo]], subsequently were also recognized by the U.S. Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Dihigo, Martin | publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum | url=http://baseballhall.org/hof/dihigo-mart | accessdate=April 13, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}{{cite web | title=Mendez, Jose | publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum | url=http://baseballhall.org/hof/mendez-jose | accessdate=April 13, 2010}}{{cite web | title=Torriente, Cristobal | publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum | url=http://baseballhall.org/hof/torriente-cristobal | accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bronze plaque was subsequently replaced by a marble plaque that hangs on a wall "in a poorly lit corner" of Havana's Estadio Latinoamericano.&lt;ref name="Toot 2004, p. 171"&gt;Toot 2004, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Before listing the names of the inductees, the introductory section of the plaque reads, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Cuban Professional Baseball Hall of Fame
List of players that have been selected as
BASEBALL IMMORTALS
And have deserved this just recognition for their distinguished work
maintaining an undying memory of what they were in this
sport&lt;ref name="Toot 2004, p. 171"/&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
While all of the inductees were recognized as baseball players, in several cases their distinction reflected, at least in part, accomplishments achieved after their playing careers. For example, Emilio Sabourín, [[Tinti Molina|Agustín Molina]], and [[José Rodríguez (infielder)|José Rodríguez]] were long-time managers who won championships, as also were more celebrated players such as Dihigo, [[Mike González (catcher)|Miguel Angel González]], [[Dolf Luque|Adolfo Luque]], and Marsans.&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman 2005, pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Francisco A. Poyo and Eustaquio Gutiérrez served as umpires.&lt;ref&gt;Poyo 2009, p. 560. {{cite web | title=Baseball: The King of Sports | publisher=Dominicana On Line | url=http://www.dominicanaonline.org/Portal/english/cpo_beisbol.asp | accessdate=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos Zaldo, Eugenio Jiménez, and Molina entered the business side of baseball as stadium developer, promoter, and league administrator.&lt;ref&gt;González Echevarría 1999, pp. 91, 122, 125, 410.&lt;/ref&gt; Wenceslao Gálvez wrote a history of baseball in Cuba, published in 1889, which according to [[Roberto González Echevarría]] "may very well be the first history of the game ever written anywhere".&lt;ref&gt;González Echevarría 1999, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other inductees achieved distinction outside of baseball. For example, Juan Antiga, who played in the Cuban League for just two seasons prior to completing medical school, became a notable intellectual, [[homeopathy|homeopath]], government official, and diplomat, serving as ambassador to Switzerland and delegate to the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Delgado-García 2005, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; The type of post-playing distinction most often recognized by the hall, however, is military service, especially during the [[Cuban War of Independence]] that was fought from 1895 to 1898. [[Alfredo Arango]], Eduardo Machado, and Carlos Maciá served as officers in the Cuban revolutionary army and Sabourín, [[Juan Manuel Pastoriza]], and Ricardo Cabaleiro died in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez 1999, p. 83. Figueredo 2003, p. 33. Figueredo 2005, pp. 16–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, opportunities to play in the United States became increasingly important to Cuban players. Some of the earliest opportunities to play in the U.S. came in nearby [[Key West, Florida|Key West]] beginning about 1890. Key West had an independent baseball league with considerable participation by Cuban emigrants, and Cuban League players were recruited to play there during the off season. Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Molina and Poyo began their baseball careers in Key West before moving on to the Cuban League.&lt;ref&gt;Poyo 2009, pp. 548–556.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, a Cuban all-star team, the [[All Cubans]], undertook their first barnstorming tour of the United States. The team, which was racially integrated (reflecting the racial integration of the Cuban League) played against professional and semi-professional teams, white and black, until 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Burgos 2007, pp. 81–82. Hogan, pp. 88–89. Kuntz.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the U.S. [[Baseball color line|color line]] soon affected Cuban players. By 1904, white Cubans, such as [[Juan Violá]], were playing in the [[Minor league baseball|minor leagues]], and in 1911 [[Rafael Almeida]] and [[Armando Marsans]] broke into the [[Major League Baseball|majors]] with the [[Cincinnati Reds]].&lt;ref&gt;Burgos 2007, pp. 94–98. Toot 2004, pp. 31–45.{{cite web | title=Juan Violat Minor League Statistics &amp; History | publisher=Baseball-Reference.com | url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=violat001jua | accessdate=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Cubans with darker complexions played in the Negro leagues for teams such as the [[Cuban Stars (West)]], the [[Cuban Stars (East)]], and the [[New York Cubans]]. Some Cuban players moved on to success with U.S. teams, such as [[José Méndez]] with the [[Kansas City Monarchs]] and [[Cristóbal Torriente]] with the [[Chicago American Giants]].&lt;ref&gt;Riley 2002, pp. 203, 545–546, 580, 787–788.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extensions created by Cubans in the United States===
After the closing of the Cuban League in 1961, inductions to the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame ceased in Havana for more than five decades. The players who had migrated to the United States, however, formed an organization, the Federation of Professional Cuban Baseball Players in Exile (''Federación de Peloteros Profesionales Cubanos en el Exilio'') which held elections in [[Miami]] to add new members to the hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cubans in Baseball Halls of Fame | publisher=cubanball.com | url=http://www.cubanball.com/halloffame.html | accessdate=April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These additional members are not universally recognized; they are not recognized in Cuba,&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Alfonso 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; nor are they included in lists of Hall of Fame inductees shown in reference books by historians Peter Bjarkman and Jorge Figueredo.&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman 2005, p. 65. Figueredo 2003, pp. 508–509.&lt;/ref&gt; The Miami elections continued in three phases—1962 through 1986, 1997 through 1998, and 2007—ultimately declaring more than 200 additional individuals as inductees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame Phase 2 | publisher=cubanball.com | url=http://www.cubanball.com/cubahall2.html | accessdate=April 15, 2010}}{{cite web | title=Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame Phase 3 | publisher=cubanball.com | url=http://www.cubanball.com/cubahall3.html | accessdate=April 15, 2010}}{{cite web | title=Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame Phase 4 | publisher=cubanball.com | url=http://www.cubanball.com/Images/History/HallofFame/Cubahall4/cubahall4.html | accessdate=April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformulation of the Hall of Fame since 2014===
In August 2014, Cuban filmmaker and baseball fan Ian Padrón brought together a group of 12 prominent fans to create a group called Enthusiasts for the Refoundation of the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame. The group developed a set of rules to govern a reformulated hall which would recognize the 68 original members, provide for regular elections of additional professional and amateur players from both the pre-revolution and post-revolution periods, and would help arrange for the hall to be part of a Cuban baseball museum. With support from the National Institute of Sport, Physical Education, and Recreation (INDER), a meeting of sports commentators was held on November 7–8, 2014. The meeting approved the draft rules, selected a jury of 25 people to select the inductees, and planned for subsequent annual elections. Four players and an umpire were honored from the pre-revolution era—[[Connie Marrero|Conrado (Connie) Marrero]], [[Minnie Miñoso|Orestes (Minnie) Miñoso]], [[Camilo Pascual]], [[Steve Bellán|Esteban (Steve) Bellán]], and umpire [[Amado Maestri]]. Five players were also honored the post-revolution era, the first players from that period to be recognized—[[Omar Linares]], [[Orestes Kindelán]], [[Antonio Muñoz (baseball)|Antonio Muñoz]], [[Luis Casanova (baseball)|Luis Casanova]], and [[Braudilio Vinent]].&lt;ref name="Refoundation"/&gt;

The '''Estadio José María Minella''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Mar del Plata]], [[Argentina]]. It is owned and administrated by the Municipality of [[General Pueyrredón Partido|General Pueyrredón]].

==History==

Argentina was chosen as the host [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] of the nation by FIFA in London, England on 6 July 1966, and Mar del Plata, as one of the most touristic cities in the country, was selected as a venue. The stadium has the distinction of being the southernmost stadium to host a World Cup matchThe organizing committee, under supervision of the [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship]] that ruled Argentina since [[1976 Argentine coup d'état|1976]], decided to build a new stadium on the same spot as 40 years earlier it had been the Mar del Plata hippodrome. The construction began in 1976 and the stadium was opened on May 21, 1978 with a friendly match between a team formed by players from [[Mar del Plata]] and another one with players from [[Tandil]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mardelplata-ayer.com.ar/deportes.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The sports journalist Mario Trucco proposed the name to honour [[José María Minella]], a renowned former [[midfielder]] from Mar del Plata, who played during the 1930s and 1940s for the [[Club Atlético River Plate]] and the [[Argentina national football team]], and later manager of the River Plate team from 1945 to 1959 in what became one of the team's most successful eras.
[[File:José-María-Minella-Stadium present.JPG|thumb|left|The Pan America Cauldron was installed for the [[1995 Pan American Games|12th Pan American Games]].]]

During the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] Mar del Plata hosted six Fifa World Cup matches, three [[1978 FIFA World Cup Group 1|Group 1]] and three [[1978 FIFA World Cup#Group 3|Group 3]] matches.

As the city of Mar del Plata is a very important tourist destination and the biggest seaside beach resort in Argentina, since its construction this stadium has been the main host of the many annual [[Torneos de Verano (Argentina)|Summer Tournaments]].

On February 24, 1993, the stadium played host to the second, and final, Intercontinental Cup for Nations (known as the [[Artemio Franchi Trophy]]) match between the then-defending [[Copa América|South American football champions]], [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], and reigning [[UEFA European Football Championship|European champions]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. The match ended 1–1 after extra time, but Argentina went on to win 5 – 4 on [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalties]].

From March 12 to March 26, 1995 Mar del Plata hosted the [[1995 Pan American Games|12th Pan American Games]], and the José María Minella was venue for the opening and closing ceremonies, and the [[Football at the 1995 Pan American Games|football tournament]].

Since [[2015 Argentine Primera División|2015]] [[Aldosivi]] plays on [[Argentine Primera División|first division]] and uses this stadium for its home matches, while [[Club Atlético Alvarado]], currently playing on [[Torneo Federal A|third division]], uses it.

==Facilities==

The José María Minella offers parking lots for 250 cars, a 590 m2 lounge and 245 m2 VIP area, conference room and two 550 m2 gyms. It is part of the "[[Teodoro Bronzini]]" Municipal Sports Park, a 35 hectares area with several sport venues, including the [[Polideportivo Islas Malvinas]], the [[Julio Polet]] Municipal Velodrome, the Pan American Field Hockey Stadium, the "[[Alberto Zorrilla]]" Natatorium, the "Justo Roman" Athletic stadium and the [[Patinódromo Municipal]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mardelplata.gob.ar/7001010000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sporting Events==

The stadium was built for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] and during June 1978 it hosted six matches, three [[1978 FIFA World Cup Group 1|Group 1]] matches and three [[1978 FIFA World Cup#Group 3|Group 3]] matches.

The '''FIDE World Chess Championship 2002''' was held in [[Moscow, Russia]]. The first six rounds were played between 27 November and 14 December 2001, and the final match started on 16 January and ended on 23 January 2002. The [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[Ruslan Ponomariov]], aged 18, won the championship and became the youngest FIDE World Champion.

==Background==
At the time of this championship, the World title [[World Chess Championship#Split title (1993 - 2006)|was split]]. The Classical World Champion, [[Vladimir Kramnik]], did not participate, as well as the previous Classical Champion and world's highest-rated player, [[Garry Kasparov]]. However, all other strongest players of the world took part, including the top seed and winner of the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2000|previous FIDE World Championship]] [[Viswanathan Anand]].

==Playing conditions==
The championship was a knockout tournament similar to other FIDE World Chess Championships between 1998 and 2004: the players were paired for short matches, with losers eliminated. The field of 128 participants was reduced to one winner over seven rounds.

Rounds 1–5 consisted of a two game match, followed by tie breaks at faster time controls if required. The time control for regular games was 75 minutes for the first 40 moves and 15 minutes for the rest of the game, with 30 seconds added after each move. Tie breaks consisted of two rapid chess games (20 minutes each + 10 seconds per move); followed by two blitz games if required (5 minutes + 10 seconds per move); followed by a single [[Armageddon chess]] game if required (white has 6 minutes and must win, black has 5 minutes and only needs to draw). The semifinals (round 6) were best of four games, and the final was best of eight games, with the same conditions for the tie-breaks.

In addition to previous criticisms of the knockout format (see [[FIDE World Chess Championship 1998#Controversies]]), this tournament was criticised by [[Garry Kasparov]] for using a faster time control, which Kasparov claimed was lowering the standard of the games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chesscenter.com/twic/twic377.html The Week in Chess 377 - 29 January 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

All players are [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmasters]] unless indicated otherwise.

'''C.''' During prostration, the rigidity of the extended and flexed arms is retained for several seconds as flaccidity gradually returns.]]
The '''fencing response''' is a peculiar position of the arms following a [[concussion]]. Immediately after moderate forces have been applied to the [[brainstem]], the forearms are held flexed or extended (typically into the air) for a period lasting up to several seconds after the impact. The fencing response is often observed during athletic competition involving contact, such as [[American football]], [[Ice hockey|hockey]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[rugby league]], [[Australian rules football]] and [[combat sports]]. It is used as an overt indicator of injury force magnitude and midbrain localization to aid in injury identification and classification for events including, but not limited to, on-field and/or bystander observations of sports-related head injuries.&lt;ref name="psychtoday"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mouse-man/200908/youtube-helps-identify-new-tool-in-the-evaluation-brain-injury | title=Youtube helps identify a new tool in the evaluation of brain injury | publisher=Psychology Today | date=August 28, 2009 | accessdate=April 4, 2015 | author=Newton, Phil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to fencing reflex and posturing==
The fencing response designation arises from the similarity to the [[asymmetrical tonic neck reflex]] in infants. Like the reflex, a positive fencing response resembles the [[Fencing#Equipment|''en garde'' position]]&lt;!--Link shows three varieties of position--&gt; that initiates a fencing bout, with the extension of one arm and the flexion of the other.

Tonic posturing (see [[abnormal posturing]]) preceding [[convulsion]] has been observed in sports injuries at the moment of impact&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCrory|first1=PR|last2=Berkovic|first2=SF|title=Video analysis of acute motor and convulsive manifestations in sport-related concussion|journal=Neurology|date=2000|volume=54|issue=7|pages=1488–1491|doi=10.1212/WNL.54.7.1488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCrory|first1=PR|last2=Bladin|first2=PF|last3=Berkovic|first3=SF|title=Retrospective study of concussive convulsions in elite Australian rules and rugby league footballers: phenomenology, aetiology, and outcome|journal=BMJ|date=1997|volume=314|issue=7075|pages=171–171|doi=10.1136/bmj.314.7075.171}}&lt;/ref&gt; where extension and flexion of opposite arms occur despite body position or gravity. The fencing response emerges from the separation of tonic posturing from convulsion and refines the tonic posturing phase as an immediate forearm motor response to indicate injury force magnitude and location.

==Pathophysiology==
{{incomprehensible|section=1|date=June 2016}}
The neuromotor manifestation of the fencing response resembles reflexes initiated by vestibular stimuli. Vestibular stimuli activate [[primitive reflexes]] in human infants, such as the [[asymmetric tonic neck reflex]], [[Moro reflex]], and [[parachute reflex]], which are likely mediated by vestibular nuclei in the brainstem. The [[lateral vestibular nucleus]] (LVN; Deiter’s nucleus) has descending efferent fibers in the vestibulocochlear nerve distributed to the motor nuclei of the anterior column and exerts an excitatory influence on ipsilateral limb extensor motoneurons while suppressing flexor motoneurons. The anatomical location of the LVN, adjacent to the cerebellar peduncles (see [[cerebellum]]), suggests that mechanical forces to the head may stretch the cerebellar peduncles and activate the LVN. LVN activity would manifest as limb extensor activation and flexor inhibition, defined as a fencing response, while flexion of the contralateral limb is likely mediated by crossed inhibition necessary for pattern generation.

In simpler terms, the shock of the trauma manually activates the nerves that control the muscle groups responsible for raising the arm.

==Injury severity and sports applications==
In a survey of documented head injuries followed by unconsciousness, most of which involved sporting activities, two thirds of head impacts demonstrated a fencing response,&lt;ref name="Hosseini"&gt;Hosseini AH, Lifshitz J. Brain Injury Forces of Moderate Magnitude Elicit the Fencing Response. ''Med. Sci. Sports Exerc.'', 2009;41(9):1687–97.&lt;/ref&gt; indicating a high incidence of fencing in head injuries leading to unconsciousness, and those pertaining to athletic behavior. Likewise, animal models of diffuse brain injury have illustrated a fencing response upon injury at moderate but not mild levels of severity as well as a correlation between fencing, blood brain barrier disruption, and nuclear shrinkage within the LVN,&lt;ref name="Hosseini"/&gt; all of which indicates diagnostic utility of the response. 
The most challenging aspect to managing sport-related concussion (mild [[traumatic brain injury]], TBI) is recognizing the injury.&lt;ref name="Guskiewicz"&gt;Guskiewicz KM, Bruce SL, Cantu RC, et al. National Athletic

==Further application==
The fencing response may also have the potential to indicate traumatic brain injury for soldiers in military settings, specifically with regard to [[blast injury]] and subsequent [[shell shock]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} There are currently no studies or data to determine the utility of the fencing response in such an arena.

==Notable fencing displays==

'''Gilmore Field''' was a [[minor league baseball]] park in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], that served as home to the [[Hollywood Stars]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]] from 1939–57 when they, along with their intra-city rivals, the [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Los Angeles Angels]], were displaced by the transplanted [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] of the [[National League]].

==History==
Gilmore Field opened on May 2, 1939 and was the home of the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League until September 5, 1957. The stadium had a [[seating capacity]] of 12,987 people. It was there on September 23, 1948, that Ronald Reagan introduced President Harry S. Truman at a campaign rally, the first time that Reagan personally met a U.S President.

===Location===
The ballpark was located on the south side of [[Beverly Boulevard]] between Genesee Avenue and The Grove Drive, just east of where [[CBS]] Television City is currently located. A couple hundred meters to the west was [[Gilmore Stadium]], an oval-shaped venue built several years earlier, which was used for football games and midget auto racing. To the east was the famous [[Pan-Pacific Auditorium]]. Both facilities were built by Earl Gilmore, son of Arthur F. Gilmore and president of A. F. Gilmore Oil, a California-based petroleum company which was developed after Arthur struck oil on the family property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.projectballpark.org/history/pcl/gilmore.html| title= Gilmore Field| publisher=Project Ballpark| accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was rich in petroleum, which was the source of the "tar" in the nearby [[La Brea Tar Pits]]. Later, the Gilmore Drive-In Theater was built, just south of the ballpark and east of the Farmers Market.

===Field===
The field had intimate quarters from the spectator standpoint – first and third bases were 7.2 meters (24 feet) from the first row of seats. Home plate was 10.2 meters (34 feet) from the stands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmersmarketla.com/history/marketfacts.html The Sporting Life (Farmer's Market)], Retrieved June 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The outfield gave the pitchers more of a break with foul lines 101 meters (335 feet) long, power alleys about 116 meters (385 feet), and 123 meters (407 feet) to center field. (Ritter, p.&amp;nbsp;75) The power alleys were thus 12 meters (40 feet) deeper than in the cross-town counterpart, [[Wrigley Field (Los Angeles)|Wrigley Field]]. The diamond was situated in the northwest corner of the field.

==Baseball==
===Hollywood Stars===
[[File:LA Hollywood Stars baseball team memorobilia 1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Hollywood Stars memorabilia]]
In 1938 Herbert Fleishaker, owner of the [[Mission Reds]] moved his team to Los Angeles, and took the name of the [[Hollywood Stars]] after the city's previous [[Pacific Coast League|PCL]] franchise. After but one season, the team was sold to new owners, among them Bob Cobb of [[Brown Derby]] Restaurant fame and the inventor of the [[Cobb salad|California Cobb Salad]]. In their salad days, as it were, the Stars attracted glamorous actors and other celebrities or anyone else who wanted to be "seen", much as [[Dodger Stadium]] would later. One of the L.A. Angels players, [[Chuck Connors]], made a successful move from one side of the box seat railing to the other, becoming the star in "The Rifleman", a popular 1950's TV show. The Stars would play at Gilmore Field through the 1957 season.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
In 1948, Gilmore Field became the spring training location for the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]].

==Football==
The [[Hollywood Bears]] football team of the [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]] played at the stadium in 1940–1942 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailynews.com/2010/10/24/an-la-history-of-pro-football/|title=An L.A. history of pro football|publisher=dailynews.com|accessdate=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movies==
Although L.A.'s Wrigley Field seemed to get the lion's share of Hollywood screen time, Gilmore Field also had its moments on celluloid. It was featured in a 1949 movie called ''[[The Stratton Story]]'', starring [[James Stewart]] and [[June Allyson]], the true story of a promising pitcher ([[Monty Stratton]]) whose career was curtailed due to a hunting accident that left him with an artificial leg. Stratton's [[major league baseball]] career was over, but he made a comeback at the minor league level. The scenes at the end of the movie were set elsewhere, but were filmed at Gilmore Field. The layout of the outfield, and especially the exceptionally high left and right field corners, help to identify it.

In [[The Atomic City]] (1952) Gilmore Field plays the site of a "Communist spy drop" during a game with  the still new televising of the game providing the FBI agents with close ups.

Gilmore Field was also seen in the movie ''[[711 Ocean Drive]]'' (1950). Half of the [[neon]] [[art deco]] "Hollywood Stars" sign, above the stadium entrance, is clearly visible.

==Demolished==
The ballpark site was abandoned after 1957. Gilmore Field was razed in 1958, beginning soon after an announcement in the Los Angeles ''Times'' of January 17. Much of the site is now occupied by a parking lot at [[CBS Television City]], near the Farmers Market.  In September 1997, the Pacific Coast League Historical Society, CBS, and the A.F. Gilmore Company dedicated a bronze plaque in commemoration of Gilmore Field on a wall outside CBS Studio 46. "The Ferris Wheel", one of the episodes of "Rescue 8", a syndicated United States television series broadcast in September 1958, was filmed at the demolition of Gilmore Field and includes many views of the stadium as it was being razed.

'''Harlow Stadium''' is a [[greyhound racing]] track located in [[Harlow]], [[Essex]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Track Search|url=http://www.gbgb.org.uk/tracks.aspx|publisher=Greyhound Board of Great Britain|accessdate=24 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225034358/http://www.gbgb.org.uk/tracks.aspx|archivedate=25 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium also has executive suites, a restaurant, a number of bars and conference and banqueting facilities. 

Racing takes place every Monday afternoon, Wednesday evening and every Friday and Sunday morning with Saturday Morning Meetings starting from 17th November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbgb.org.uk/Results.aspx|title=Latest results|publisher=Greyhound Board of Great Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opening ==
Harlow Stadium opened on Wednesday 15 March 1995. The site chosen for racing was an area north east of the town known as the Pinnacles just off the Roydon Road and directly west of the football stadium. Access to the track is on Stadium Way past the Scimitar industrial park. Toni Nicholls bought the land from receivers when the new football stadium was being built in 1993 and constructed the new facilities including executive suites, a restaurant and conference and banqueting facilities. In addition a large car park was constructed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fry|first=Paul|title=The Official NGRC Greyhound Racing Yearbook, page 215|year=1995|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=186054-010-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ever trial session, in preparation for the opening was held in October 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.co.uk/remember-when-october-2/|title=Remember When - October 1994|publisher=Greyhound Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first Racing Manager was former trainer Stan Gudgin who was replaced by Mark Schellenberg after Gudgins retirement. In 2005 Nicholls’s company Leaside Leisure Ltd came to an agreement with Barclay Entertainment to sell the track. The new stadium owner was Dave Barclay joint-owner of a successful building contractors business in the Essex area. Despite offers from developers Barclay continues to invest into the track and has achieved some notable successes for Harlow Greyhound Stadium. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hobbs|first=Jonathan|title=Greyhound Annual 2008, page 187|year=2007|publisher=Raceform|isbn=978-1-905153-53-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the closure of [[Walthamstow Stadium]] in 2008 Chris Page arrived as General Manager with five trainers; John Coleman, Mark Wallis, Mick Puzey, Graham Sharp and Kelly Mullins. Mark Wallis brought the ultimate prize to the track after winning the [[2009 English Greyhound Derby]] with Kinda Ready. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/cmlink/harlow_herald_2_1062/sport/wallis_makes_mark_in_greyhound_derby_1_396468|title=Wallis makes Mark in Greyhound Derby|publisher=Harlow Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harlow was rewarded with a first [[Sky Sports]] televised meeting in 2011 and Barclay brought in Greyhound Sales in 2013.

In 2018 the stadium signed a deal with [[Satellite Information Services|SIS]] to race every Monday and Wednesday evening and every Friday and Sunday morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sis.tv/news/sis-announces-schedule-sis-british-greyhound-service-2018/|title=SIS announces schedule for SIS British Greyhound Service for 2018|publisher=SIS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The football program offers a residency program and year-round camps ranging from three days to five weeks in length and was previously led by former [[National Football League|NFL]] [[quarterback]] [[Chris Weinke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-03-19/news/os-img-academies-john-madden-football-0319_1_img-academies-florida-state-quarterback-football-program |title=IMG Academies launches John Madden football academy - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel |website=Articles.orlandosentinel.com |date=2010-03-19 |accessdate=2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The academy fielded a high school football team for the first time in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imgacademies.com/madden-football-academy/news/img-academy-to-field-a-high-school-football-team-in-2013/1456/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831100448/http://www.imgacademies.com/madden-football-academy/news/img-academy-to-field-a-high-school-football-team-in-2013/1456/ |date=August 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, MaxPreps called IMG Academy the "nation's top high school football facility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Spiewak |url=http://www.maxpreps.com/news/GZqTevVQyk-pjG-hsNGJmQ/behind-the-scenes-photos-from-img-academy.htm |title=Behind the scenes photos from IMG Academy |website=MaxPreps.com |date=2013-10-03 |accessdate=2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMG Academy named Kevin Wright the head coach in spring 2015 after Weinke accepted a position as quarterbacks coach with the [[Los Angeles Rams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IMG Academy names Steve Walsh as director of football and Kevin Wright as coach|url = http://usatodayhss.com/2015/img-academy-names-steve-walsh-as-director-of-football-and-kevin-wright-as-coach|website = USA Today High School Sports|access-date = 2016-02-17|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright guided the program to its first undefeated regular season (9–0) in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IMG Academy Football Top Performers|url = http://www.bradenton.com/sports/article53849335.html|website = bradenton|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Earnest Byner]], the running backs coach is featured in ''NFL Undiscovered'', which featured overseas prospects who have little or no prior knowledge of the game since 2016.

===Soccer===
IMG Academy offers an Academy soccer program and year-round soccer camps. IMG Academy was home to [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer's]] full-time residency program for the United States' U-16 and U-17 men's national teams. Started in 1999 and closed in 2017, it was an integral in developing the United States' top youth [[soccer]] prospects. The original idea of the residency program was to give elite players the opportunity to train in a professional environment as most [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] clubs did not have a substantial youth academy system in place prior to 2009.  The Bradenton Academy has grown from an initial 20 players to 30 in 2002 and then to 40 in 2003.  The program is now split into a U-16 squad and a U-17 squad.

A typical day for the student-athlete at Bradenton consists of academic classes in the morning followed by sports training in the afternoon.  Students at the academy take accelerated courses and graduate high school a year early, making the players who do not turn pro immediately some of the most heavily recruited prospects in [[college soccer]]. The academy can trace its roots back to [[Project 2010]] which highlighted ways U.S. Soccer could make the senior men's national team a legitimate threat to win the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] by the end of the decade.  Two programs that were born from Project 2010 were [[Generation Adidas]] (previously called ''Project-40'') and the Bradenton academy.  The academy was started in January 1999 with the backing of [[International Management Group|IMG]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], but will be closed in 2017 due to the proliferation of U.S. Development Academy programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2017/03/17/19/22/20170317-news-u17mnt-after-fulfilling-mission-us-soccer-residency-program-to-complete-final-semester|title=U.S. Soccer Residency Program Set to Complete Final Semester After 18 Years|website=www.ussoccer.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baseball===
IMG Academy has an Academy baseball program and year-round camps, in addition to summer Wood Bat Leagues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imgacademies.com/baseball-academy/wood-bat-league/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211014454/http://www.imgacademies.com/baseball-academy/wood-bat-league/ |date=December 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basketball===
IMG Academy's post graduate program played in their only appearance in the 2016 National Prep Championship in New Haven, Connecticut. Among the teams were Brewster Academy, [[DME Academy]], Elev-8 Sports Institute, Fork Union Military Academy, Hargrave Military Academy, IMG Academy, Northfield Mount Hermon School, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Prep Championship Field Announced|url=http://www.newenglandrecruitingreport.com/news/national-prep-championship-field-announced-2|website=New Englang Recruiting Report|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head coach of IMG’s national high school team is Sean McAloon, who previously was the head coach at [[St. John's College High School|St. John’s College High School]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]  

Its basketball alumni include [[Dallas Mavericks]] forward Dwight Powell and [[Orlando Magic]] forward [[Jonathan Isaac]], the 6th overall pick of the 2017 NBA draft. In 2017, IMG Academy had its first two selections to the McDonald's All American Game, [[Trevon Duval]] was selected to the boys game and Rellah Boothe was selected to the girls game. In 2018, [[Anfernee Simons]] would enter directly from the academy to the [[2018 NBA Draft]], being the second player in the academy's history to do so and the third overall player to be drafted directly out of the high school.

During the preparation for the [[2017 NBA Draft]], the IMG Academy hosted their first ever draft combine. The Professional Basketball Combine would be held as an alternative (mainly for seniors) to measure their abilities and potentially give them the chance to enter the [[NBA]], if not allow them the chance to play in the [[NBA G League]] or even overseas, with nearly every participant that year doing exactly that. Currently, four players that participated in the event signed [[two-way contract]]s to enter the NBA properly, with eight of them going overseas and 11 players entered the G League.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.professionalbasketballcombine.com/2017-pbc-participants.html&lt;/ref&gt; The event would be held once again in 2018, gaining more popularity that year with the participation of former [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] player and current professional player [[LiAngelo Ball]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.si.com/nba/2018/05/21/pro-basketball-combine-nba-draft-liangelo-ball-lavar-ball&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golf===
IMG Academy has an Academy golf program and offers summer camps. The students and camp participants play on two golf courses in Sara Bay Country Club and IMG academy Golf Club. IMG's practice facilities include a big range which is open to golf students most of the day and a little range which is open to everyone 24/7.

===Lacrosse===
IMG Academy has an Academy lacrosse program and year-round camps. IMG Academy launched a high school team in 2012, featuring a new women's program made in 2018. Notable alumni include [[Tehoka Nanticoke]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncaa.com/news/lacrosse-men/article/2018-05-22/college-lacrosse-memory-grandparents-fuels-tehoka-nanticokes&lt;/ref&gt;, Marc-Antoine Pion&lt;ref&gt;https://www.collegecrosse.com/2017/7/27/16050180/college-crosse-prospectus-former-harvard-crimson-defenseman-johns-hopkins-marc-pion-mercer-island&lt;/ref&gt;, Zack Pinney and Nick Wood. Prior to that, IMG Academy hosted their first full-time lacrosse student-athlete, Matthew Xirinachs, starting in September 2010. Xirinachs went on to join the Drexel Men's Lacrosse Team in the fall of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://insidelacrosse.com/news/2012/06/20/img-academy-field-first-lacrosse-team |title=IMG Academy to Field First Lacrosse Team |publisher=Inside Lacrosse |date=2012-07-23 |accessdate=2015-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623040332/http://insidelacrosse.com/news/2012/06/20/img-academy-field-first-lacrosse-team |archivedate=June 23, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jamsil Students' Gymnasium''' ({{ko-hhrm|잠실학생체육관|蠶室學生體育館}}) is an [[indoor arena|indoor sporting arena]] located in [[Seoul, South Korea]].  The capacity of the arena is 7,500 and was built from November 1972 to December 1976 to host [[Boxing at the 1988 Summer Olympics|Boxing]] events at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], and wheelchair basketball events at the [[1988 Summer Paralympics]].

==Events==
Jamsil has held a number of [[Esports]] events, including the [[StarCraft]] competitions the [http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/10th_SonicTV_Starleague|2015 10th SonicTV Starleague] and [http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/2012_Tving_OSL|2012 Tving OSL].

PWF Korea Life Attack Pro wrestling event will be held on April 27, 2014 at this venue.  A historical moment in Korean culture history as a lost sport has regained its popularity in this country.  Aside from the Olympics, it also hosted boxing events at the [[1986 Asian Games]], and is the home stadium for the [[Seoul SK Knights]] of the [[Korean Basketball League]].

On 15 March 2012, general cable broadcaster [[JTBC]] held a public shoot and press conference at the Gymnasium, to showcase their new programme ''[[Shinhwa Broadcast]]'', hosted by six-member boyband [[Shinhwa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Ji-yeon|title=Shinhwa on ''Shinhwa Broadcast''|url=http://global.mnet.com/news/newsdetail.m?searchNewsVO.news_id=201203161015_4386|accessdate=12 November 2012|newspaper=Mnet News|date=16 March 2012|agency=CJ E&amp;M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian rules football==

===Early years===
Football has been played on Kardinia Park since the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne|date=29 September 1884|page=7|title=Football}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prior to the 1940s, Kardinia Park was the secondary football venue in the city of Geelong; [[Corio Oval]] was the primary venue, and the [[Geelong Football Club]] played its [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] games at that venue until 1940. Kardinia Park served as the home ground for the [[Geelong Association Football Club|Geelong (A.) Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] from 1922&lt;ref name="3DecemberAustralasian"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|publication-place=Melbourne|date=3 December 1921|title=Football – turning the tables|author=J.W.|volume=CXI|issue=2905}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1925, before that club moved to the Western Oval in [[Geelong West, Victoria|Geelong West]];&lt;ref name="admit"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne|date=7 January 1926|page=11|title=Football – New Association clubs}}&lt;/ref&gt; local and district football was played regularly on the ground.

The Geelong Football Club began playing its home games at Kardinia Park in 1941 after Corio Oval was commandeered by the military during [[World War II]], and it became its permanent home venue thereafter.

===Recent history===
On 23 May 2002, Kardinia Park hosted a visit from the [[Dalai Lama]], who again visited the stadium in June 2007.

Kardinia Park is regarded as a proverbial graveyard for teams playing against Geelong, which has an especially good record at the ground in recent years. Geelong did not lose a single match played at the venue between 26 August 2007 and 27 August 2011. Geelong's [[Jimmy Bartel]] credited the home field advantage to the fact that Geelong is one of the few clubs which practices on the same field that it plays on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/all-power-to-the-cats-on-home-turf-20110410-1d9cn.html|title=All Power to the Cats on home turf |date=11 April 2011|publisher=[[The Age]]|accessdate=2001-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June 2011, it was announced the stadium would have a new name in 2012. After 10 years as naming rights sponsor of Skilled Stadium, [[Skilled Group]] decided to relinquish these rights as of 31 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The stadium is nicknamed "The Cattery" by the club's supporters.

Floodlights were installed prior to the [[2013 AFL season]], and the venue staged its first night match during the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeol.com.au/databases/news/simonds_stadium_lights_up_without_a_hitch.php|title=Simonds Stadium lights up without a hitch|work=AEOL|date=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its current layout Kardinia Park consists of the following seating areas: the Reg Hickey Stand, Players Stand, Premiership Stand, Brownlow Stand, Ford Stand/Fred Flanagan Room and the Gary Ablett Terrace, with the latter containing the main standing room section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kardiniapark.vic.gov.au/the-stadium/seating-plans|title=Kardinia Park Seating Plans|date=1 May 2017|work=Kardinia Park Stadium Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kardinia Park was included in the [[Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid]], with a proposed upgrade to 44,000 seats analogous to the later mooted stage 5 of redevelopment, with the new multi tiered stand stretching all the way from the southern end, around the western side and the northern Ablett stand, however the bid lost out to Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AUSTRALIAN WORLD CUP STADIUMS|url=http://www.austadiums.com/australiaworldcup/|publisher=austadiums.com|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
During the late 1920s and early 1930s when [[Motorcycle speedway]] was becoming popular throughout Australia, Kardinia Park was home to a dirt track speedway known as the Geelong Velodrome. The Velodrome hosted the inaugural [[Victorian Individual Speedway Championship|Victorian Solo Speedway Championship]] in 1926/27 and followed up with the second championship held in 1927/28. Both championships were won by [[Billy Pilgrim (speedway rider)|Billy Pilgrim]].

==Cricket==
In 2016, it was announced that international cricket would be played at the ground for the first time. The ground hosted second [[Twenty20 International|T20 International]] between [[Sri Lankan cricket team in Australia in 2016–17|Australia and Sri Lanka]] on February 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-v-sri-lanka-2016-17/engine/match/1001351.html | title=Sri Lanka tour of Australia, 2nd T20I: Australia v Sri Lanka at Geelong, Feb 19, 2017 | publisher=ESPNcricinfo | accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground witnessed memorable match between two nations, where Sri Lanka won the match by 2 wickets at the end. Sri Lanka chased 173 runs at the last ball of the match, where [[Asela Gunaratne]] smashed 46-ball unbeaten 84 runs to seal the match and series for Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-v-sri-lanka-2016-17/content/story/1083287.html | title=Gunaratne 84* caps stunning series win for Sri Lanka | publisher=ESPNcricinfo | accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 January 2018 the ground hosted a [[Women's Big Bash League]] and [[Big Bash League]] double header with the [[Melbourne Renegades]] taking on the [[Sydney Sixers]] with the Renegades winning in both matches.

The ground has been confirmed as one of the venues to be used in the [[2020 ICC T20 World Cup]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/604922|title=Eight cities throughout Australia to host ICC World T20 2020|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Redevelopments==
[[File:Aerial perspective of Kardinia Park stadium.jpg|thumb|Aerial perspective of Kardinia Park stadium. Taken August 2018.]]
A {{A$}}28 million redevelopment of the ground was announced in 2003, with A$13.5 million in funding from the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian Government]], A$4.5 million from the Geelong Football Club, and A$2 million from the [[Australian Football League|AFL]]. The redeveloped ground was opened on 1 May 2005 during the first home game of the 2005 season which includes a new western entry and membership area, as well as a new five-level grandstand with a capacity of approximately 6,000 spectators on the eastern side of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austadiums.com/stadiums/stadiums_redevelopment.php?id=101|title=Simonds Stadium Redevelopment|date=1 January 2017|work=Austadiums|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519064604/http://www.austadiums.com/stadiums/stadiums_redevelopment.php?id=101|archivedate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/132549/Part_4_Annual_Report.pdf|title=Department for Victorian Communities 2004–05 Annual Report|date=1 July 2005|work=Victorian Government|quote=Refer to pp. 57|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519064448/http://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/132549/Part_4_Annual_Report.pdf|archivedate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A favourite for the honour of the naming of the new stand was [[Bob Davis (Australian rules footballer)|Bob Davis]], coach of the Cats' premiership side in 1963. On 15 June 2005, [[City of Greater Geelong]] councillors granted the club its wish to change the name of the new eastern stand to the [[Reg Hickey]] Stand, while the southern stand became the [[Doug Wade]] Stand. The northern terrace became known as the [[Gary Ablett Sr.|Gary Ablett]] Terrace while the western gate was renamed the Bob Davis Gate.

In September 2007, Skilled Stadium received a further total of A$25 million towards the rebuilding of the Ross Drew Stand on the south western side of the ground. Funding for the project included A$14 million from the Federal Government and A$6 million from the Victorian Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases/2007/097.htm&amp;pageID=003&amp;min=phc&amp;Year=&amp;DocType=0|title=Geelong Scores a Win with Funding for Skilled Stadium|date=21 September 2007|work=Australian Government|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519065258/https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases%2F2007%2F097.htm&amp;pageID=003&amp;min=phc&amp;Year=&amp;DocType=0|archivedate=19 May 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new stand, known as the Premiership Stand, features seating for 4,500 supporters, including up to 800 corporate guests on match days. The stand opened on 10 April 2010 and was officially unveiled in round four of the [[2010 AFL season]], coinciding with the unveiling of the 2009 premiership flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.de-air.com.au/completed-projects-sports-leisure/skilled-stadium-premiership-stand|title=Skilled Stadium Premiership Stand (d&amp;e)|work=de-air.com.au|date=1 January 2011|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170519071157/http://www.de-air.com.au/completed-projects-sports-leisure/skilled-stadium-premiership-stand|archivedate=19 May 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.watpac.com.au/project/skilled-stadium-premiership-stand/|title=Skilled Stadium Premiership Stand (Watpac Limited)|date=1 January 2011|work=Watpac.com.au|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170519071040/https://www.watpac.com.au/project/skilled-stadium-premiership-stand/|archivedate=19 May 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A$50,000 was also spent on a new 600-seat temporary stand between the Reg Hickey and Doug Wade stands.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In May 2009 it was revealed that the City of Greater Geelong as stadium owner had approached a number of Melbourne-based AFL clubs discussing the financial advantages of playing home games at the ground. The ground could see clubs earning A$30 a patron at Skilled Stadium, compared to A$7 earned at [[Docklands Stadium|Etihad Stadium]] in Melbourne. The Geelong Football Club had first floated Skilled Stadium as a potential home game venue for Melbourne clubs in 2006.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In April 2011, plans for the third stage of redevelopment were revealed. Under the plans, the Doug Wade stand at the southern end of the stadium was pulled down at the end of the [[2011 AFL season]]. The works included the demolition of the old Doug Wade stand and the construction of a new 9,000 (approx.) seat Southern Grandstand. The new Grandstand also included:&lt;ref name=Stage3Info&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtpartnership.com/sector/simonds-stadium-stage-3-redevelopment-lighting-upgrade-projects-geelong/|title=Simonds Stadium Stage 3 Redevelopment|date=1 January 2014|work=WTPartnership|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170519073339/http://www.wtpartnership.com/sector/simonds-stadium-stage-3-redevelopment-lighting-upgrade-projects-geelong/|archivedate=19 May 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Improved spectator amenities
* A Community Wellness and Education Centre – a purpose built training facility for community sporting groups
* A new 'Past Players' room
* Constructed concurrently to the Grandstand were five new light towers which comply with Australian Broadcast requirements. The new light towers allow the ground to host night AFL and cricket matches.

The redevelopment saw the stadium increase in capacity to 34,500. The redevelopment cost $33 million, of which $11.7 million was spent on the new lighting.&lt;ref name="Stage3Info"/&gt;

[[Image:Kardinia Park at night, Aug 2014.jpg|right|thumb|360px|An AFL night match at Simonds Stadium (2014)]]

Significant miscalculations were made with respect to the budget required for the stage 3 redevelopment and consequently several aspects of the plans were scaled back by the Geelong Football Club in November 2011, including the removal of a proposed supporters lounge and decreasing capacity by 1,000 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2011/11/23/292851_news.html|title=Stadium renovations still on track|work=Geelong Advertiser|date=23 November 2011|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120917183804/http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2011/11/23/292851_news.html|archivedate=17 September 2012|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new grandstand was named the Players Stand in August 2012 and from 1 November 2011, the venue became known as Simonds Stadium, after homebuilding group Simonds Homes signed a five-year naming rights deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austadiums.com/news/news.php?id=490|title=Simonds Stadium new name for Kardinia Park|work=Austadiums|date=4 October 2011|archivedate=19 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519083901/http://www.austadiums.com/news/news.php?id=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Players Stand was officially opened on 1 June 2013, prior to Geelong's first proper home match of the [[2013 AFL season]] against [[Gold Coast Football Club|Gold Coast]]. The match was the first to be played under the new floodlights and was played before 30,082 fans, the largest crowd at the stadium at that time since the first stage of the re-development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geelongcats.com.au/news/2013-06-01/talking-points-cats-and-suns|title=Talking points: Cats and Suns|date=1 June 2013|work=Geelong Cats|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519075613/http://www.geelongcats.com.au/news/2013-06-01/talking-points-cats-and-suns|archivedate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, then Victorian opposition leader [[Daniel Andrews]] promised $70 million to complete stage four of the upgrade of the oval in the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party's]] successful election campaign. The stage funded involves demolishing the Brownlow and Jennings stands and replacing them with a new stand, for a total capacity of 36,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/geelong/labor-pledges-100-million-on-upgrades-for-simonds-stadium-and-gpac/story-fnjuhovy-1227052255475|title=Labor pledges $100 million on upgrades for Simonds Stadium and GPAC|work=Geelong Advertiser|date=9 September 2014|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170519080024/http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/geelong/labor-pledges-100-million-on-upgrades-for-simonds-stadium-and-gpac/news-story/e24ed8b77acdf0124790ac57958f4333|archivedate=19 May 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new stand, eventually named the Brownlow Stand (in honour of the club's [[Brownlow Medal]] winners and Mr [[Chas Brownlow|Charles Brownlow]]) was opened on 18 May 2017.

The total cost of the fourth stage of redevelopment was $91 million, of which $75m came from the [[Victorian Government]], $6m from the [[City of Greater Geelong]], $6 million from the Geelong Football Club and $4 million from the [[Australian Football League|AFL]].&lt;ref name="BrownlowStandOpened"/&gt; The total capacity of Kardinia Park after the stage 4 redevelopment is technically 36,000;&lt;ref name=Austadiums2017&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austadiums.com/news/news.php?id=589|title=Kardinia Park: New Brownlow Stand unveiled|date=18 May 2017|work=Austadiums|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170616141820/http://www.austadiums.com/news/news.php?id=589|archivedate=16 June 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, given the way the stadium is configured for AFL matches, its capacity is said to be unable to exceed 34,000.&lt;ref name="CapacityReddit"/&gt;

In April 2017, the Victorian Government announced an investment of $3.9 million in the upcoming state [[Government budget|budget]] to fund the planning and design stage for Stage 5 of the redevelopment. The proposed redevelopment would be the final part of the more than decade-long process to increase the capacity of Kardinia Park to 40,000 and will result in the Ford Stand and Gary Ablett Terrace being removed for the new stand to ring around the remaining open-air section of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kardiniapark.vic.gov.au/2017/04/media-release-2|title=Media Release: Labor Kick Starts Next Upgrade of Geelong's Kardinia Park|work=Kardinia Park Stadium Trust|date=27 April 2017|archivedate=19 May 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170519083508/https://www.kardiniapark.vic.gov.au/2017/04/media-release-2|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kardiniapark.vic.gov.au/2017/04/media-release|title=Media Release: Kardinia Park Stadium Trust welcomes stadium budget boost|work=Kardinia Park Stadium Trust|date=27 April 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170519083106/https://www.kardiniapark.vic.gov.au/2017/04/media-release|archivedate=19 May 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Keystone Centre''' is a multi-purpose facility located in [[Brandon, Manitoba]]. Its main 5,102-seat arena which is known as Westoba Place is the home of the [[Brandon Wheat Kings]] of the [[Western Hockey League]] and the annual [[Royal Manitoba Winter Fair]]. 

==History==
The original structure was built in 1973 and was known as the Keystone Centre. It was a joint venture between the City of Brandon, the Government of Manitoba, and the [[Provincial Exhibition of Manitoba]], which organizes the Royal Fair each March. The Keystone Agricultural and Recreation Centre Inc., a non-profit corporation formed by the three parties, owns and operates the complex and grounds.  The Provincial Exhibition of Manitoba contributed the original land and assets. The City of Brandon and the Province of Manitoba have agreed to cover any operating deficits of the Keystone Centre.

The [[Canad Inns]] hotel replaced the [[Manex Arena]], the former home of the Wheat Kings. The complex underwent through an interior redesign in the summer of 2007. The Keystone Centre also features an exhibition hall for trade shows and agricultural events, two smaller hockey arenas, and the [[Brandon Curling Club]].

On May 1, 2007, Westman Communications Group purchased the [[naming rights]] to the main arena and viewing lounge. Westman Communications Group ended their naming rights to the main arena in October, 2017, and signage was removed in January, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brandonsun.com/local/westman-communications-group-place-out-as-name-for-keystone-centre-arena-471717084.html|title=Westman Communications Group Place out as name for Keystone Centre arena|date=2018-01-30|website=Brandon Sun|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 2, 2018, Westoba Credit Union purchased the naming rights to the main arena and viewing lounge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wheatkings.com/article/keystone-centre-to-become-westoba-place|title=WESTMAN PLACE TO BECOME WESTOBA PLACE|date=2018-02-02|website=Brandon Wheat Kings|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The Westoba Place hosted the [[2010 Memorial Cup]].&lt;ref name="Brandon Wheat Kings to host"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whl.ca/news/?id=10297 |title=Brandon Wheat Kings to host 2010 MasterCard Memorial Cup |accessdate=October 16, 2008 |date=October 16, 2008 |publisher=Western Hockey League |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021055949/http://www.whl.ca/news/?id=10297 |archivedate=October 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brandon wins bid"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2008/10/15/memorial-cup-brandon.html|title=Brandon wins bid to host 2010 Memorial Cup|accessdate=October 17, 2008|date=October 15, 2008|work=CBC Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major events held at the Keystone Centre include the [[1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]] (co-hosted with [[Winnipeg]]), the [[1995 Ford World Men's Curling Championship|1995 Ford Men's]] and [[1995 Ford World Women's Curling Championship|Women's]] [[World Curling Championships]], the [[1982 Labatt Brier]], the [[1993 Scott Tournament of Hearts|1993]] and [[2002 Scott Tournament of Hearts]], the [[1997 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials]], and the [[1994 Air Canada Cup]]. On October 13, 2017, Curling Canada announced that the [[2019 Tim Hortons Brier]] will take place at the Keystone Centre from March 2nd to 10th.&lt;ref name="Brandon to host 2019 Tim Hortons Brier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curling.ca/blog/2017/10/13/brandon-to-play-host-to-2019-tim-hortons-brier/|title=Brandon to play host to 2019 Tim Hortons Brier |accessdate=April 2, 2018 |date=October 13, 2017 |publisher=Curling Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Western Canadian Junior "B" Hockey Championship, the [[Keystone Cup]], is named after the Keystone Centre as it was the alternate site used by the original tournament in 1983 that took place in [[Portage la Prairie, Manitoba]].

[[WWE]] held their flagship [[Monday Night Raw]] event on October 23, 1995.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9065">Over the course of the game's history, several incidents relating to '''match-fixing in English football''' have taken place.

==19th Century Test match collusion==
From 1893–1898, a form of play-offs known as ''test matches'' were used to decide [[promotion and relegation]] between the two divisions of the [[Football League]]. Initially they were direct ties between two teams, but from 1896 a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format was used. In the 1898 test matches, earlier results meant [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]] and [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] went into the final test match knowing a draw would result in promotion for both teams. In their 0–0 draw, the pair made little attempt to hide their collusion. The ''Athletic News'' reported that "the teams could have done without goalkeepers, so anxious were the forwards not to score". The Football League resolved the ensuing scandal by expanding the First Division from 16 to 18 clubs, allowing promotion for all four of the clubs who participated in the test matches. The test match system was then abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=League Football and the Men Who Made It|first=Simon|last=Inglis|publisher=Willow Books|year=1988|isbn=0-00-218242-4|pages=43–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season, Burnley's [[Jack Hillman]] offered [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] players £2 each to "take it easy" in a match between the teams. Hillman was suspended for a year for his actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Roll-call of shame: the history of British match-fixing| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/rollcall-of-shame-the-history-of-british-matchfixing-1611272.html| publisher=Independent | accessdate=5 February 2013| location=London| first=David| last=Aaronovitch| date=15 March 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Billy Meredith bribery suspension==
On the final day of the 1904–05 season, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] played a particularly bad-tempered game, in which a number of fights broke out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester The City Years |publisher=James Ward |location=Halifax |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-9558127-7-4|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four months later, it emerged that Villa captain [[Alec Leake]] had come forward with an accusation: that City's [[Billy Meredith]] had offered him £10 to allow City to win. The Football Association suspended Meredith until April 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harding |first=John |title=Football Wizard – The Billy Meredith Story |publisher=Robson Books |location=London |year=1998 |isbn=1-86105-137-9|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meredith, who had not been permitted to give evidence at the hearing, protested his innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, ''Football Wizard'', p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, however, while engaged in a dispute with Manchester City over whether he should be paid during his suspension, he spoke out on the matter. He admitted the bribery attempt, but intimated that others were involved, saying "I was only the spokesman of others equally guilty".&lt;ref&gt;Harding, ''Football Wizard'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1915 betting scandal==
{{main|1915 British football betting scandal}}
A 1915 match between [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] aroused suspicions owing to the apparent lack of effort on the part of the Liverpool players. The match finished 2–0 to a relegation-threatened Manchester United.

After the match, [[Flyer (pamphlet)|handbills]] started to appear, alleging that a large amount of money had been bet at odds of 7/1 on a 2–0 win to United.&lt;ref name="Sharpe"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharpe|first=Graham|title=Gambling's Strangest Moments: Extraordinary But True Stories from Over 200 Years of Gambling's History|year=2005|publisher=Robson|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1861058640|pages=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An investigation by [[the Football Association]] was launched and found that players from both sides had been involved in rigging the match: [[Sandy Turnbull]], [[Arthur Whalley]] and [[Enoch West]] of United, and [[Jackie Sheldon]], [[Tom Miller (footballer)|Tom Miller]], [[Bob Pursell (footballer born 1889)|Bob Pursell]] and [[Thomas Fairfoul]] of Liverpool; Sheldon was a former United player himself and was found to be the plot's ringleader. Some players, such as Liverpool's [[Fred Pagnam]] and United's George Anderson refused to take part. Pagnam had threatened to score a goal to ruin the result, and indeed late in the match hit the crossbar, causing his teammates to publicly remonstrate with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Phillips, Oliver|title=The Golden Boys: A study of Watford's Cult Heroes|publisher=Alpine Press|page=49|year=2001|isbn=0-9528631-6-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later testified against his team-mates at the FA hearing. At the same hearing, United player Billy Meredith denied any knowledge of the match-fixing, but stated that he became suspicious when none of his teammates would pass the ball to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tibballs|first=Geoff|title=Great Sporting Scandals: From Over 200 Years of Sporting Endeavours|year=2003|publisher=Robson Publishing|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1861056869|pages=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

All seven players were banned from playing for life in a decision handed down on 27 December 1915. The FA concluded that it had been a conspiracy by the players alone – no official from either club was found guilty of wrongdoing, and neither club was fined or had points deducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=Peter|title=Swifter Than the Arrow: Wilfred Bartrop, Football and War|year=2008|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|location=United Kingdom|isbn=9781848760684|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|1964 British betting scandal}}

==Accrington Stanley–Bury, 2008==
Unusual betting patterns were reported for a match between [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] on the final day of the 2007–08 season. A Football Association investigation resulted in five players, four of whom played for Accrington Stanley and the other for Bury, being charged with betting on a Bury win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/07/football-betting-accrington-five-charged |title=Five players charged in League Two betting scandal |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2009-04-07 |accessdate=2013-02-04 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jay Harris (footballer born 1987)|Jay Harris]] was banned from playing for a year, [[David Mannix]] for ten months, [[Robbie Williams (footballer born 1979)|Robert Williams]] and [[Peter Cavanagh]] for eight months, and [[Andrew Mangan]] for five months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/8162844.stm|title=Four players banned over betting|date=22 July 2009|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/leaguetwo/6004978/Accrington-defender-Peter-Cavanagh-suspended-after-betting-probe.html|title=Accrington's Pater Cavanagh banned for betting on Bury match|date=2009-08-10|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=2013-02-04|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each player was also fined between £2,000–5,000.

==Europol investigation==
{{Main|2013 Europol match-fixing investigation}}
A [[Europol]] investigation into match-fixing by criminal syndicates published its initial findings in February 2013. Of 380 matches in Europe alleged to be fixed, one took place in England. The match, a [[UEFA Champions League]] tie from the "last three or four years", was not named due to "ongoing judicial proceedings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21319807|title=Match-fixing: Champions League tie played in England 'was fixed'|date=4 February 2013|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/feb/04/europol-investigation-football-matchfixing|title=Europol: investigators identify 380 fixed football matches|date=4 February 2013|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 February 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Knirscherschiene.jpg|thumb|An example of a mouthguard used in the treatment of [[bruxism]]]]

A '''mouthguard''' is a protective device for the [[mouth]] that covers the teeth and gums to prevent and reduce injury to the [[teeth]], arches, [[lip]]s and [[Gingiva|gum]]s. A mouthguard is most often used to prevent injury in [[contact sports]], as a treatment for [[bruxism]] or [[Temporomandibular joint disorder|TMD]], or as part of certain dental procedures, such as [[tooth bleaching]] or [[sleep apnea]].  Depending on application, it may also be called a '''mouth protector''', '''mouth piece''', '''gumshield''', '''gumguard''', '''nightguard''', '''occlusal splint''', '''bite splint''', or '''bite plane'''.

==History==
The exact origins of the mouthguard are unclear. Most evidence indicates that the concept of a mouthguard was initiated in the sport of [[boxing]]. Originally, boxers fashioned rudimentary mouthguards out of cotton, tape, sponge, or small pieces of wood. Boxers clenched the material between their teeth. These boxers had a hard time focusing on the fight and clenching their teeth at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Knapik JJ, Marshall SW, Lee RB, Darakjy SS, Jones SB, Mitchener TA, Jones BH | year = 2007 | title = Mouthguards in Sport Activities | doi = 10.2165/00007256-200737020-00003 | journal = Sports Medicine | volume = 37 | issue = 2| page = 120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since these devices proved impractical, Woolf Krause, a British dentist, began to fashion mouthpieces for boxers in 1892. Krause placed strips of a natural rubber resin, [[gutta-percha]], over the [[maxillary incisors]] of boxers before they entered the ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reed RV | year = 1994 | title = Origin and early history of the dental mouthpiece | doi = 10.1038/sj.bdj.4808485 | journal = British Dental Journal | volume = 176 | issue = | page = 479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Phillip Krause, Woolf Krause’s son, is often credited with the first reusable mouthpiece. Phillip Krause’s invention was highlighted in a 1921 championship fight between [[Jack Britton]] and [[Ted "Kid" Lewis]]. Lewis was a school friend of Krause and the first professional to utilize the new technology, then called a ‘gum shield.’ During the fight, Britton’s manager successfully argued that the mouthpiece was an illegal advantage. Philip Krause was an amateur boxer himself and undoubtedly used his device before 1921.&lt;ref name="Knapik et al., 2007, p. 120"&gt;Knapik et al., 2007, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been other claims to the invention of the mouthguard as well. In the early 1900s, Jacob Marks created a custom-fitted mouthguard in London.&lt;ref&gt;Pontsa, Peter T. (2008). Mouth Guards Prevent Dental Trauma in Sports. The Dent-Liner 12 (3).&lt;/ref&gt;  An American dentist, Thomas A. Carlos, also developed a mouth guard at approximately the same time as Krause. Carlos claimed that he made his first mouthpiece in 1916 and later suggested his invention to the United States Olympian Dinnie O’Keefe in 1919. Another dentist from Chicago, E. Allen Franke, also claimed to have made many mouth guards for boxers by 1919.&lt;ref name="Knapik et al., 2007, p. 120"/&gt;  
The mouthguard’s relevance was again brought to the center of attention in a 1927 boxing match between [[Jack Sharkey]] and [[Mike McTigue]]. McTigue was winning for most of the fight, but a chipped tooth cut his lip, and he was forced to forfeit the match. From that point on, mouthguards were ruled acceptable and soon became commonplace for all boxers.&lt;ref name="Knapik et al., 2007, p. 121"&gt;Knapik et al., 2007, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1930, descriptions of mouthguards first appeared in dental literature. Dr. Clearance Mayer, a dentist and boxing inspector for the [[New York State Athletic Commission]], described how custom mouthguards could be manufactured from impressions using wax and rubber. Steel springs were even recommended to reinforce soft materials.&lt;ref name="Knapik et al., 2007, p. 121"/&gt;

In 1947, a Los Angeles dentist, Rodney O. Lilyquist, made a breakthrough by using transparent acrylic resin to form what he termed an "acrylic splint".  Molded to fit unobtrusively over the upper or lower teeth, the acrylic mouthguard was a distinct improvement over the thick mouthguard worn by boxers.  It meant that the athlete could talk in a normal manner while the mouthguard was in place.  In the January 1948 issue of the Journal of the American Dental Association, the procedure for making and fitting the acrylic mouthguard was described in detail by Dr. Lilyquist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = | year = 1948 | title = Acrylic Splints for Athletes:  Transparent Slip Casings for the Teeth as a Protection From Blows | url = | journal = Journal of the American Dental Association | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 109–110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He immediately received nationwide recognition as the father of the modern mouthguard for athletes.&lt;ref&gt;"Protecting Athletes' Teeth."  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 21.162 (Feb. 6, 1948) 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first athlete to wear the acrylic mouthguard was a member of the UCLA basketball team, Dick Perry, who modeled the device at a convention of the Southern California Dental Association.  Another early wearer was Frankie Albert, quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers.
[[File:Football mouthguard.jpg|thumb|American Football mouthguard]]
In the 1940s and 1950s, dental injuries were responsible for 24-50% of all injuries in American football.&lt;ref name="Knapik et al., 2007, p. 121"/&gt;  In 1952, Life magazine did a report on [[Notre Dame football]] players without incisors.&lt;ref&gt;The fighting Irish look tough again. Life Magazine 1952; 33: 60-63.&lt;/ref&gt;  The article drew a lot of public attention and led to the inclusion of mouthguards in other contact sports. In the 1950s, the [[American Dental Association|American Dental Association (ADA)]] began researching mouthguards and soon promoted their benefits to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = | year = 2006 | title = Using Mouthguards to Reduce the Incidence and Severity of Sports-related Oral Injuries | url = | journal = Journal of the American Dental Association | volume = 137 | issue = 12| pages = 1712–1720 | doi=10.14219/jada.archive.2006.0118}}&lt;/ref&gt;    In 1960, the ADA recommended the use of latex mouthguards in all contact sports. By 1962, all high school football players in the United States were required to wear mouthguards. The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)]] followed suit in 1973 and made mouthguards mandatory in college football. Since the introduction of the mouthguard, the number of dental injuries has decreased dramatically.&lt;ref name="Knapik, et al., 2007, p. 121"&gt;Knapik, et al., 2007, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mouthguards have become a standard in many sports. In addition to football, the NCAA currently requires mouthguards in [[ice hockey]], [[field hockey]], and [[lacrosse]]. The ADA shows that mouthguards are extremely effective in preventing facial injury in contact and non-contact sports. The ADA recommends mouthguards be used in 29 sports: [[acrobatics]], [[basketball]], [[bicycling]], [[boxing]], [[equestrianism|equestrian]], [[American football|football]], [[gymnastics]], [[team handball|handball]], ice hockey, [[inline skating]], lacrosse, [[martial arts]], [[racquetball]], [[rugby football]], [[shot putting]], [[skateboarding]], [[skiing]], [[skydiving]], [[soccer]], [[softball]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[surfing]], [[volleyball]], [[water polo]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] and [[wrestling]].&lt;ref name="Knapik, et al., 2007, p. 121"/&gt;

==Types==

===Stock or ready made===
Manufactured in a pre-formed shape in various sizes but with nearly no adjustment to fit the user's mouth. The only adjustment possible is minor trimming with a knife or scissors.

===Mouth adapted or "boil and bite"===
A thermoplastic material manufactured in a pre-formed shape in various sizes that can be adapted to fit more closely to an individual's teeth and gums by heating and molding such as boiling then placing in the mouth. Some are now available that incorporate special fins within the fitting zones which increase retention and give an improved fit over traditional boil and bite mouth types. Guards are usually made of [[Ethylene-vinyl acetate]][http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5339832.html][http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4044762.html], commonly known as EVA. Some of the newer technologies offer an alternative, stronger thermo-polymer that allows for lower molding temperatures, below 140F to prevent burning by scalding hot water. This is the most popular mouthguard used by amateur and semi-professional sportsmen, providing adequate protection but relatively low comfort in comparison to the custom-made guard.&lt;ref name="b-and-b"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zadik Y, Levin L |title= Does a free-of-charge distribution of boil-and-bite mouthguards to young adult amateur sportsmen affect oral and facial trauma? |journal=Dent Traumatol |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=69–72 |date=February 2009 |pmid=19208013 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-9657.2008.00708.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Custom-made===
[[File:Vacuum-form mouth guard.jpg|thumb|Vacuum form mouthguard made from an impression using dental alginate.]]

An impression of the user's teeth is used by specialist manufacturers to create a best-fit mouth protector. The impression may be obtained by using a specially designed impression kit that uses dental putty, or from a dentist who will take an impression in dental [[Alginic acid#Sodium alginate|alginate]] material. The resulting impression is sent to a lab that makes a guard from the impression.  In the [[EU]], the guard must be sold with a [[CE mark]] and the guard must have passed an EC Type-Examination test, performed by an accredited European Notified Body. Applying a CE mark without such certification is a criminal offense.{{where?|date=October 2012}}

*'''Vacuum Form'''
**Custom-made mouth guards using this type of machine produce single layer mouth guards
**Fit not as good as pressure laminated but offers more protection than boil and bite
*'''Pressure Laminated'''
**Custom-made mouth guards using this type of machine produce multi-layer mouth guards
**Offers superior fit, comfort and more protection
*'''Impressionless'''
**Made from a medical-grade thermo polymer, the guards are activated with hot (not boiling water) and create a custom comfort fit, completely unique to the shape of the mouth.
**1.6&amp;nbsp;mm thin, Remoldable, Works with braces, Stays secure in mouth during the entire game or practice
**Allows athletes to talk, breathe and drink naturally

===Dentistry===
[[File:Aufbissschiene.jpg|thumb|Occlusal splint]]

Occlusal splints (also called bite splints, bite planes, or night guards) are removable dental appliances carefully molded to fit the upper or lower arches of teeth.

They are used to protect tooth and restoration surfaces, manage mandibular (jaw) dysfunction [[Temporomandibular joint disorder|TMD]], and stabilize the jaw joints during [[occlusion (dentistry)|occlusion]] or create space prior to restoration procedures. People prone to nocturnal [[bruxism]], or nighttime clenching, as well as [[morsicatio buccarum]] may routinely wear occlusal splints at night. However, a meta-analysis of occlusal splints used for this purpose concluded "There is not enough evidence to state that the occlusal splint is effective for treating sleep bruxism. An indication of its use is questionable concerning sleep outcomes, but there may be some benefit with regard to [[tooth wear]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The effectiveness of occlusal splints for sleep bruxism | pmid=18364692 | doi=10.1038/sj.ebd.6400569 | volume=9 | issue=1 | year=2008 | journal=Evid Based Dent | pages=23 | last1 = Jagger | first1 = R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occlusal splints are typically made of a heat-cured acrylic resin. Soft acrylic or light cured composite, or vinyl splints may be made more quickly and cheaply, but are not as durable, and are more commonly made for short-term use. Soft splints are also used for children because normal growth changes the fit of hard splints.

They cover all the teeth of the upper or lower arch, but partial coverage is sometimes used. Occlusal splints are usually used on either the upper or the lower teeth, termed maxillary splints or mandibular splints respectively, but sometimes both types are used at the same time. Maxillary splints are more common, although various situations favor mandibular splints.

Stabilizing or Michigan-type occlusal splints are generally flat against the opposing teeth, and help jaw muscle relaxation, while repositioning occlusal splints are used to reposition the jaw to improve occlusion.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Usage==
*'''[[Dental trauma]]'''
**Mouthguards are used in sports where deliberate or accidental impacts to the face and jaw may cause harm. Such impacts may occur in many sports including [[baseball]], [[boxing]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[puroresu]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[wrestling]], [[association football|football (soccer)]], [[gridiron football]], [[Australian football]], [[lacrosse]], [[basketball]], [[figure skating]], [[ice hockey]], [[underwater hockey]], [[field hockey]], [[water polo]], [[skiing]], and [[snowboarding]]. Mouthguards may also prevent or reduce harm levels of [[concussion]] in the event of an injury to the jaw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzda.org.nz/pub/index.php?id=43 NZ Dental Association advice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629063538/http://www.nzda.org.nz/pub/index.php?id=43 |date=2007-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjsm.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/35/2/81 "Do mouthguards prevent concussion?"]&lt;/ref&gt; In many sports, the rules of the sport make their use compulsory,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rugbysmart.co.nz/plan/protectiveequipment.html "...mouthguards became compulsory in 1997..."] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20051202015904/http://www.rugbysmart.co.nz/plan/protectiveequipment.html |date=2005-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or local health laws demand them. Schools also often have rules requiring their use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oralmart.com/mouthguards-mandatory-for-basketball-wrestling-teams-middle-upper-schools/ "...mouthguards will be mandatory for all basketball and wrestling teams in the middle and upper schools...."]&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in various high risk populations for [[Teeth|dental]] injuries are repeatedly reporting of a low [[Compliance (medicine)|compliance]] of individuals for the regular using of mouthguard during activities.&lt;ref name="PREVENTION"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zadik Y, Jeffet U, Levin L |title=Prevention of dental trauma in a high-risk military population: the discrepancy between knowledge and willingness to comply |journal=Mil Med |volume=175 |issue=12 |pages=1000–1003 |date=December 2010 |pmid=21265309 |doi=10.7205/MILMED-D-10-00150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, even with regular use, effectiveness in prevention on [[dental trauma]] is not complete, and injuries can still occur even when mouthguards are used as users are not always aware of the best makes or size, which inevitably result in a poor fit.&lt;ref name="ELITE"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zadik Y, Levin L |title=Orofacial injuries and mouth guard use in elite commando fighters |journal=Mil Med |volume=173 |issue=12 |pages=1185–1187 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19149336 |doi=10.7205/milmed.173.12.1185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Patriotas was founded in 2003 by the then-governor of [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] Miguel Ángel Bermúdez, together with then [[Coldeportes]]' chairman and the owners of hardware business G&amp;J. In its first year in the [[Categoría Primera B|Primera B]], the club reached the semifinals, where was eliminated by [[Boyacá Chicó F.C.|Bogotá Chicó]].

In 2004 the team advanced again to the Semifinals, where the team played against [[Deportivo Antioquia]], [[Centauros Villavicencio]] and [[Tigres F.C.|Expreso Rojo]], but did not qualify. In 2005 Patriotas was second in the general table but in the Semifinals was eliminated by [[Rionegro Águilas|Bajo Cauca]]. In 2009 some changes were implemented in the tournament. Patriotas was first in Group B but was eliminated again in the Semifinals and ended up in third place.

In 2011 the team was promoted to the [[Categoría Primera A]] after beating [[América de Cali]] by penalties. In 2016, the team qualified for the Knockout phase for the first time, after placing 8th in the First Stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publimetro.co/co/noticias/2016/11/20/clasificados-8-liga-aguila-millonarios-santa-fe-medellin-cali-atletico-nacional-tolima-patriotas-bucaramanga.html|title=Millonarios y Patriotas, entre los 8 que disputarán la Liga Águila|author=|date=|website=Publimetro Colombia|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the team also managed to qualify for the [[2017 Copa Sudamericana]], which was the first participation of the team in an international competition, reaching the second stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caracol.com.co/radio/2016/12/05/deportes/1480947897_884827.html|title=Harold Rivera no continuará en la dirección técnica del Patriotas|first=Caracol|last=Radio|date=|website=Caracol Radio|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Purchase''' (1757 – 1837) was an English [[cricket]]er who played for the [[Hambledon Club]].

He was only 16 when he made his debut in 1773.

Born in [[Liss]], [[Hampshire]], he played for his county in 1773 and 1774 but then did not appear again until 1781.  He was possibly in the armed forces at the time or otherwise working away from Hampshire.

He was an all-rounder noted as a slow bowler who maintained good line and length and a "fair hitter".  He played regularly from 1781 till the end of his career in 1803, making 113 known first-class appearances.

It was built in 1949 and opened on May 30, 1952. According to Marty Himes, auto racing historian and founder of the Himes Museum of Motor Racing Nostalgia in Bay Shore, John Evers and Harry Rambo purchased the land, which was originally swampland. With the help of Harold G. Seaman of Riverhead and others, they cleared it of trees and filled in the swamp. The Riverhead Raceway opened as a 1/5 of a mile, high bank clay track, made with clay trucked in from Greenport. A local driver, Ronnie Matson, won the new raceway’s first event. The track is a high-banked, [[asphalt]] oval a quarter mile around. It also features a [[Figure 8 racing|Figure 8]] course.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1596">'''[[Rugby union]] in [[Mozambique]]''' is a minor but growing sport. 

==History==
As a former Portuguese colony, rugby has been a late arrival to Mozambique. Although rugby has been played in Portugal for decades, it has never become a major sport, and it did not transfer it to its colonies.

[[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] used to play a series against [[rugby union in Malawi|Nyasaland]] sides during the 1930s called the [[Woury Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;Bath, Richard (ed.) The Complete Book of Rugby (Seven Oaks Ltd, 1997 {{ISBN|1-86200-013-1}}) p71&lt;/ref&gt;

Rugby is centred on the national capital and main city, [[Maputo]]. Mozambique's poverty and lack of infrastructure make it difficult to maintain a proper national league structure.

However, the country borders South Africa, where rugby is a major sport, and also neighbours Madagascar and Zimbabwe where the game is popular, as well as Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia, all of which have had a historical rugby presence.

Rugby also has extensive TV coverage on satellite networks in Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.travbuddy.com/travel-blogs/7106/Rugby-and-Saris-Nampula-72&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1998, Chinese Internet company SRSNet (四通利方) built and operated the official Chinese language online portal for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. Later that year, [[SRSNet]] acquired Hua Yuan Online and changed the name to Sina.com, and  the sports platform became known as SINA Sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 新浪公司动态|url = http://corp.sina.com.cn/chn/sina_info_1998.html|website = corp.sina.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, Chinese sports fans quickly adopted the platform as a preferred way to access sports around the world. SINA Sports has had the following milestones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 新浪公司动态|url = http://corp.sina.com.cn/chn/sina_info_1998.html|website = corp.sina.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:

Not to be confused with the [[split jump]] used by [[dancers]], [[gymnasts]] and [[figure skaters]]) is a form of [[exercise]] which focuses on the upper leg muscles, especially the [[quadriceps]]:
#assume an upright [[squatting position]] with one foot forward and the other back
#with a jumping motion, simultaneously move the rear foot forward and the front foot back, ending as position 1 with the feet reversed
#repeat

The exercise is often used in [[soccer]] training.

'''Tangolates''' (also known in Buenos Aires as '''Tango-Pilates''' and '''Pilates-Tango'''), involves body exercises that draw on  characteristics from [[Tango (dance)|Tango dancing]] and [[Pilates]]. It utilizes a partner method rather than individual exercises and incorporates aerobic and cardio elements. Tangolates is usually performed on a specially designed apparatus, on a mat, or on a Pilates apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argentinaindependent.com/life-style/tango-pilates-tangolates/|title=The Argentina Independent|website=Argentinaindependent.com|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.it/salute/benessere/news/a847845/tangolates/|title=Tangolates|date=9 November 2012|website=Elle.it|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Tangolates originated in 2004 in a public hospital for patients with motor disorders.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} In order to help patients with their workouts, each one was coupled with an instructor in partner exercises.  

==Research==
In order to assess the effects of these exercises on patients, a preliminary test of efficacy was conducted at the Tamara Di Tella’s Pilates Room. The results of this research were presented at the 10th International Congress of Internal Medicine, held on 24-27 August 2004, in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uba.ar/comunicacion/p_electronicas/uu/anteriores/septiembre04/notas/02a.php] {{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients were convoked for 325 sessions, over a period of three months. Afterwards, patients asserted that the exercises helped them “not only to move better but also to feel better”. Their evaluations led to the conclusion that Tangolates partner exercises help patients improve, not only their movement but also their quality of life.

According to Di Tella, the fact that Tangolates requires a rapport between two people is a very interesting subject of research. Partner work may help stimulate the brain and could become an alternate pathway to successful movement. “It is that internal ignition that may just work for some brain disorder patients”, says Di Tella. Indeed, Tango’s strong and focused beat and the fact that it is done in close coordination with a partner is an excellent stimulus to initiate movement. “Tango stimulates cooperation and creates bond like no other dance, and this is an extraordinary motivator for some patients”, says Di Tella.

==Principles==
Tangolates combines the coordination and core stability that is inherent to Pilates with the cardio or aerobic element of Tango.

The [[National Hockey League]] (NHL)'s '''[[Toronto Maple Leafs]]''' has been the point of subject for a number of media in [[Culture of Canada|Canadian]] '''[[popular culture]]''', including artworks, books, novels, and songs.

==Film==
[[File:MikeMyersJune07.jpg|thumb|upright|Comedian [[Mike Myers]] has often included references to the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in his films.]]
References to the Toronto Maple Leafs have been made typically in association with the city of [[Toronto]], such as the case in the beginning of the 2010 spy film ''[[Fair Game (2010 film)|Fair Game]]''. During the scene, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent [[Valerie Plame]] was being questioned by a suspicious weapons trafficker. He asks her if she is an American, and after responding that she is Canadian, he asks her about the Leafs. She replies that she is not a fan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Covert|first=Colin|title=Review: ‘Fair Game,’ a riveting real-life spy drama|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2010/11/03/review-fair-game-a-riveting-real-life-spy-drama/|newspaper=The Mercury News|publisher=First Digital Media|date=November 3, 2010|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Canadiens–Maple Leafs rivalry|rivalry]] between the Maple Leafs and the [[Montreal Canadiens]] was also featured in the [[National Film Board of Canada]]'s adaptation of ''[[The Hockey Sweater]]'' by [[Roch Carrier]]. Completed a year after the book's publication, the [[National Film Board of Canada]] adapted the story into a ten-minute [[Animated cartoon|animated short film]] called ''The Sweater''. It was animated by [[Sheldon Cohen (artist)|Sheldon Cohen]] and voiced by Carrier.&lt;ref name="CBCDigitalArchives"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/sports/hockey/the-spirit-of-hockey/the-hockey-sweater.html |title=The Hockey Sweater |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2013-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film became one of the National Film Board's most popular works and has won numerous awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Marshall |first=Suzanne |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/the-hockey-sweater |title=The Hockey Sweater |publisher=The Historica-Dominion Institute of Canada |accessdate=2013-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named the Best Animated Film at the [[35th British Academy Film Awards|1981]] [[British Academy Film Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.bafta.org/awards-database.html?sq=The+Sweater |title=Awards Database: Film - Animated Film - 1981 |publisher=British Academy of Film and Television Arts |accessdate=2013-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another film where the hockey club was heavily featured was in ''[[Face-Off (1971 film)|Face-Off]]'', a Canadian film about a rookie Maple Leafs player and his romance with a musician. The film featured several players from the NHL, including [[Bobby Orr]], [[George Armstrong (ice hockey)|George Armstrong]], and [[Gordie Howe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metronews.ca/features/toronto/maple-leafs-playoffs-2013/2013/04/22/3-movies-inspired-by-the-toronto-maple-leafs.html|title=3 movies inspired by the Toronto Maple Leafs|publisher=Free Daily News Group Inc|work=Metro Toronto|accessdate=2 March 2018|last=Cross|first=Jessica Smith|date=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 film ''Gross Misconduct'' focused on the life of former Maple Leafs [[winger (ice hockey)|left wing]] [[Brian Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gross Misconduct|publisher=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107047/|accessdate=September 18, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901160800/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107047/|archivedate=September 1, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hockey club was also featured in the 2006 [[television documentary]] series ''[[Hockey: A People's History]]'', by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]].

Comedian [[Mike Myers]], a fan, often included references and even an entire plot line in his films. In ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'', the ticker below the news item on a television reads, "Maple Leafs win Stanley Cup". In another scene, the character [[Mini-Me]] wears a Maple Leafs sweater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Granatstein|first=Rob|title=Myers is groovy, baby!|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/M/Myers_Mike/2002/08/23/pf-760477.html|publisher=Canoe|date=August 22, 2002|accessdate=September 24, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713161820/http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/M/Myers_Mike/2002/08/23/pf-760477.html|archivedate=July 13, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the references included in several films, the Maple Leafs also played a central role in Myers' 2008 film ''[[The Love Guru]]'', where he played a guru hired to help the Maple Leafs' star player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Love Guru|publisher=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811138/|accessdate=September 18, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912033429/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811138/|archivedate=September 12, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
[[File:Roch Carrier as a child.jpg|thumb|[[Roch Carrier]], author of ''[[The Hockey Sweater]]'', as a child in a Maple Leafs sweater. ]]
References to the Leafs in literature includes [[Foster Hewitt]] juvenile hockey novel, ''He Shoots, He Scores!''. Published in 1949, it featured the members of the team, including actual managers and players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=He Shoots, he scores|last=Hewitt|first=Foster|year=1949|publisher=Thomas Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Scott Young wrote ''A Boy at the Leafs' Camp'', a children's book giving a behind-the-scenes insight into the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Boy at the Leafs' Camp|publisher=Goodreads.com|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2175182.A_Boy_at_the_Leafs_Camp|accessdate=September 18, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111020952/http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2175182.A_Boy_at_the_Leafs_Camp|archivedate=November 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several books concerning the Maple Leafs have been written, and later readapted into film. In 1971, Young and George Robertson co-wrote an adult hockey-romance novel, ''[[Face-Off (1971 film)|Face-off]]'', about the experiences of a star rookie player, Billy Duke, with the Leafs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Face-off|last1=Young|first1=Scott|last2=Robertson|first2=George|year=1971|publisher=MacMillan of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel became a movie in 1971 with [[Art Hindle]] as Billy Duke. The film featured many of the players. [[Jim McKenny]], body-doubled for Hindle for the on-ice action scenes because of his resemblance to Hindle. Owner Ballard had a part as the team doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Face-Off|publisher=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068564/|accessdate=September 18, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828212606/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068564/|archivedate=August 28, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1979, [[Roch Carrier]] wrote the short story ''[[The Hockey Sweater]]'' about a Montreal Canadiens fan who is mistakenly sent a sweater of their rival, the Maple Leafs. Originally published in French as "''Une abominable feuille d'érable sur la glace''" ("An abominable maple leaf on the ice"), it referred to the Maple Leafs sweater a mother forced her son to wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/canadiens-versus-leafs-two-rivals-meet-again-but-theyve-changed/wcm/10396669-554f-42a1-b45e-99e84ec294a3|title=Canadiens versus Leafs: Two rivals meet again, but they’ve changed|date=April 6, 2012|accessdate=July 14, 2017|work=National Post|publisher=Postmedia Network Inc.|last=O'Connor|first=Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boy is forced to weat the sweater and faces persecution of his peers and coach, also fans of the Canadiens.

==Radio shows==
In 1946, the comedy team of [[Wayne and Shuster]] performed a sketch on their CBC [[Radio programming|radio program]] in which the imaginary hockey team, the Mimico Mice, competed against the Leafs. Foster Hewitt provided the play-by-play of the game, with real player names used for the Leafs and Wayne and Shuster voiced the entire Mimico team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wayne and Shuster: Canadian comedy act|publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications|author=Ross A.

==Song==
In the video for the hit [[Leo Sayer]] song “[[When I Need You]]” (1976), he walks on the beach in Brighton, U.K. wearing a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater under his half done-up jacket. In 1990 live videos for the song "F*!#in' Up", [[Neil Young]] sports a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey. In 1992, Canadian rock band [[The Tragically Hip]] released the song "[[Fifty Mission Cap]]", which memorialized [[Bill Barilko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.pe.ca/living/the-fabulously-rich-a-tribute-to-the-tragically-hip-shares-frontmans-music-vision-for-truth-and-reconciliation-182525/|title=The Fabulously Rich, a tribute to The Tragically Hip, shares frontman’s music vision for truth and reconciliation|work=The Guardian|publisher=Saltwire Network|last=Cole|first=Sally|date=February 1, 2018|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barilko scored the series winning goal for the [[1950 Stanley Cup Finals]] before disappearing months later. On October 17, 2017, several days after the death of The Tragically Hip's lead singer [[Gord Downie]], the Maple Leafs held a [[moment of silence]] prior to their game, as well as lower the banner of Barilko's retired number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-maple-leafs-remember-gord-downie-1.4361289|title=Maple Leafs honour Gord Downie before game at ACC|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=March 2, 2018|date=October 18, 2017|work=CBCNews Toronto|last=McLaughlin|first=Amara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Fennex''' (born c.1763 at [[Gerrards Cross]], Bucks; died 4 March 1838 at [[Stepney]], London) was a famous English [[cricket]]er.  He was a noted all-rounder and right arm fast bowler.  As a batsman, Fennex was reputed to be one of the first to use forward play and was said to be a good driver of the ball.

His playing career began with [[Berkshire county cricket teams|Berkshire]] in 1785 but he was chiefly associated with [[Middlesex county cricket teams|Middlesex]] and was keeper of the ground at [[Uxbridge]].  He made 85 known first-class appearances until 1800 and then played occasionally, making nine more appearances from 1802 to 1816.

He played for the Players in the inaugural [[Gentlemen v Players]] match in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/0/316.html CricketArchive – scorecard of inaugural Gentlemen v Players match]&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[William Beldham]], he subsequently provided [[James Pycroft]] with his reminiscences.
