The '''1967 Oil Embargo''' began on June 6, 1967, the second day of the [[Six-Day War]], with a joint [[Arab]] decision to deter any countries from supporting [[Israel]] militarily.  Several [[Middle Eastern]] countries eventually limited their [[oil]] shipments, some [[embargo]]ing only the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], while others placed a total ban on oil exports.  The Oil Embargo did not significantly decrease the amount of oil available in the United States or any affected [[Europe]]an countries, due mainly to a lack of solidarity and uniformity in embargoing specific countries.  The embargo was effectively ended on September 1 with the issuance of the [[Khartoum Resolution]].

== Oil Ministers' Conference ==
During the June 9–18 Oil Ministers' Conference in [[Baghdad, Iraq]], several Arab countries issued a [[communiqué]]&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State, [[Foreign Relations Series|''Foreign Relations of the United States'']], 1964–1968, Vol. XXXIV:  [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v34 Energy Diplomacy and Global Issues] (Washington: GPO, 1986), Document 232.&lt;/ref&gt; that two resolutions were unanimously passed:

# ''"Arab oil shall be denied to and shall not be allowed to reach directly or indirectly countries committing aggression or participating in aggression on sovereignty of any Arab state or its territories or its territorial waters, particularly the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]"''
# ''"The involvement of any country directly or indirectly in armed aggression against Arab states will make assets of its companies and nationals inside the territories of Arab countries subject to the [[laws of war]]. This includes the assets of oil companies."''

Invitees included [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Kuwait]], [[Libya]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Algeria]], [[Bahrain]], [[Abu Dhabi]], and [[Qatar]]. [[Iraq]] sent copies of the Council resolution to the Embassies of [[Iran]] and [[Indonesia]], and sought the support of [[Venezuela]].

== Oil Embargo ==
The Baghdad Resolutions were important because Egypt broadcast claims of US aircraft support on June 6.  Iraq was the first country to limit its oil shipments, embargoing the United States and the United Kingdom on June 6.  Iraq, Kuwait, Algeria, and Bahrain eventually embargoed the United States and the United Kingdom.  Syria stopped all oil exports, rather than just embargoing specific countries, in order to avoid declaring specific nations as aggressors.
&lt;!-- This list of countries above is incomplete --&gt;
&lt;!-- Below is a list of countries that limited their shipments of oil to specific countries, sorted by date begun.

* Iraq (June 6-September 1): United States, United Kingdom, West Germany
* Kuwait (June 6-September 1): United States, United Kingdom, West Germany
* Libya (June 7-September 1): United States, United Kingdom
* Libya (June 7-August 9): West Germany
 --&gt;

The United States advocated emergency measures in [[OECD]] meetings and supported the establishment of an International Industry Advisory Board.  The Advisory Board was critical in efficiently apportioning limited tanker resources and managing the distribution of the limited oil resources.  This was an effective measure to negate the oil embargo as there was no consensus on what countries to embargo, and more importantly, oil shipped to a European country could then be shipped to any of the embargoed countries.  Some Arab countries encouraged the oil companies to circumvent the embargo, as the [[List of emirs of Kuwait|Amir]] of Kuwait even proposed to the US ambassador that companies simply alter [[Bill of lading|shipping manifests]] to ship oil to prohibited countries.

&lt;!-- Expand section below at some point --&gt;
Egypt sought to bend not only international political policy but also the policies of more moderate governments,&lt;ref&gt;This is substantiated in several cables from several different foreign and domestic officials, available in the [[Foreign Relations Series|FRUS volumes]] (cited above).&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to [[export of revolution|export the socialist revolution]] to neighboring moderate (i.e. conservative) countries. The embargo resulted in public pressure on Middle Eastern leaders to support [[Pan Arabism|Arab solidarity]].  [[Nasser]] effectively limited moderate countries' political options lest they risk a revolution.&lt;ref&gt;This is substantiated in the June 30 briefing by [[Director of Central Intelligence|DCI]] [[John McCone]] to [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]], about the danger and effectiveness of constant propaganda from Egyptian State Radio in Cairo. Available in the [[Foreign Relations Series|FRUS volumes]], Vol XXXIV Doc 252 (link above).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Khartoum Resolution ==
{{main|Khartoum Resolution}}
The Khartoum Resolution issued on September 1 allowed the moderate oil-producing nations (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Libya) to resume oil exports and regain this critical source of revenue without risking disquiet or even overthrow from their more radical citizens. In exchange, these countries agreed to give annual aid to "victims of [[Zionist]] aggression", namely Egypt and [[Jordan]] ($266 million and $112 million, respectively).

The 1967 oil embargo was the main reason for the formation of [[OAPEC]], which would provide a forum for the discussion of using oil politically. The organization's next embargo had a much stronger impact, triggering the [[oil crisis of 1973–74]].

[[Image:Astm hq west conshohocken 019.png|thumb|right|ASTM HQ in West Conshohocken, PA, as seen from a nearby bridge]]
'''ASTM International''', formerly known as '''American Society for Testing and Materials''', is an international [[standards organization]] that develops and publishes voluntary consensus technical [[International standard|standard]]s for a wide range of materials, products, systems, and [[Service (economics)|services]]. Some 12,575 ASTM voluntary consensus standards operate globally. The organization's headquarters is in [[West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Philadelphia]].

Founded in 1898 as the American Section of the International Association for Testing Materials, ASTM International predates other standards organizations such as the [[British Standards|BSI]] (1901), [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] (1906), [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] (1917), [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] (1918), [[Association Française de Normalisation|AFNOR]] (1926), and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] (1947).

== History ==
A group of [[scientist]]s and [[engineer]]s, led by [[Charles Benjamin Dudley]] formed ASTM in 1898 to address the frequent [[rail tracks|rail]] [[fracture|breaks]] affecting the fast-growing [[Rail transport|railroad]] industry. The group developed a standard for the steel used to fabricate rails. Originally called the "American Society for Testing Materials" in 1902, it became the "American Society for Testing and Materials" in 1961 before it changed its name to “ASTM International” in 2001 and added the tagline "Standards Worldwide". In 2014, it has changed the tagline to "Helping our World Work better". Now, ASTM International has offices in Belgium, Canada, China, Peru, and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerard|first1=Barbara|title=What is ASTM International?|url=http://info.craftechind.com/blog/what-is-astm-international|website=Craftchind: Craftech Industries|accessdate=1 February 2017|date=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership and organization ==
Membership in the organization is open to anyone with an interest in its activities.&lt;ref name=membership&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astm.org/MEMBERSHIP |title=Membership|publisher=ASTM International}} &lt;/ref&gt;  Standards are developed within committees, and new committees are formed as needed, upon request of interested members. Membership in most committees is [[Volunteering|voluntary]] and is initiated by the member's own request, not by appointment nor by invitation. Members are classified as users, producers, consumers, and "general interest". The latter includes academics and consultants. Users include industry users, who may be producers in the context of other technical committees, and end-users such as consumers. In order to meet the requirements of [[antitrust]] laws, producers must constitute less than 50% of every committee or subcommittee, and votes are limited to one per producer company. Because of these restrictions, there can be a substantial waiting-list of producers seeking organizational memberships on the more popular committees. Members can, however, participate without a formal vote and their input will be fully considered.

As of 2015, ASTM has more than 30,000 members, including over 1,150 organizational members, from more than 140 countries.&lt;ref name=DetailedOverview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astm.org/ABOUT/full_overview.html|title=Detailed Overview|publisher=ASTM International}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/BOD/ASTM|title=ASTM International Board of Directors|publisher=ASTM International}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members serve on one or more of 140+ ASTM Technical Committees. ASTM International has several awards for contributions to standards authorship, including the [[ASTM International Award of Merit]] (the organization's highest award)&lt;ref name="ASTM International Award of Merit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astm.org/MEMBERSHIP/socawards.htm#Award |title=Society Awards|publisher=ASTM International}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASTM International is classified by the United States [[Internal Revenue Service]] as a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization.

== Standards compliance ==
ASTM International has no role in requiring or enforcing compliance with its standards. The standards, however, may become mandatory when referenced by an external contract, corporation, or government.&lt;ref name=DetailedOverview /&gt;

* In the United States, ASTM standards have been adopted, by incorporation or by reference, in many federal, state, and municipal government regulations. The [[National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act]], passed in 1995, requires the federal government to use privately developed consensus standards whenever possible. The Act reflects what had long been recommended as best practice within the federal government.
* Other governments (local and worldwide) also have referenced ASTM standards &lt;ref name=TC&gt;[http://www.tc.gc.ca/tdc/summary/14000/14063e.htm Transport Canada use of ASTM] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119212130/http://www.tc.gc.ca/tdc/summary/14000/14063e.htm |date=November 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Corporations doing international business may choose to reference an ASTM standard.
* All toys sold in the United States must meet the safety requirements of ASTM F963, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Toy Safety, as part of the [[Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act]] of 2008 (CPSIA). The law makes the ASTM F963 standard a mandatory requirement for toys while the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) studies the standard's effectiveness and issues final consumer guidelines for toy safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astmnewsroom.org/default.aspx?pageid=1663|title=Safer Children's Toys – ASTM F963 Toy Safety Standard Required by U.S. Law|publisher=ASTM International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acoustic cleaning''' is a maintenance method used in [[Material handling equipment|material-handling]] and storage systems that handle [[Bulk material handling|bulk granular or particulate materials]], such as [[grain elevator]]s, to remove the buildup of material on surfaces.   Acoustic cleaning apparatus, usually built into the material-handling equipment,   works by generating powerful [[sound wave]]s which shake particulates loose from surfaces, reducing the need for manual cleaning.

==History and design ==
An acoustic cleaner consists of a sound source similar to an [[air horn]] found on trucks and trains, attached to the material-handling equipment, which directs a loud sound into the interior.  It is powered by compressed air rather than electricity so there is no danger of sparking, which could set off an explosion.  It consists of two parts:
*The acoustic driver.  In the driver, compressed air escaping past a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] causes it to vibrate, generating the sound.  It is usually made from solid machined [[stainless steel]].  The diaphragm, the only moving part, is usually manufactured from special aerospace grade titanium to ensure  performance and longevity.
*The bell, a flaring horn, usually made from spun 316 grade stainless steel. The bell serves as a sound [[resonator]], and its flaring shape couples the sound efficiently to the air, increasing the volume of sound radiated.
The overall length of acoustic cleaner horns range from 430&amp;nbsp;mm to over 3 metres long.  The device can operate from a pressure range of 4.8 to 6.2 bars or 70 to 90 psi. The resultant sound pressure level will  be around 200&amp;nbsp;dB.

There are generally 4 ways to control the operation of an acoustic cleaner. 
*The most common is by a simple timer.
*[[SCADA]] (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition).
*PLC ([[programmable logic controller]]).
*Manually by [[Ball valve]].

An acoustic cleaner will typically sound for 10 seconds and then wait for a further 500 seconds before sounding again. This ratio for on/off is approximately proportional to the working life of the diaphragm. Provided the operating environment is between −40&amp;nbsp;C and 100&amp;nbsp;°C, a diaphragm should last between 3 and 5 years. The wave generator and the bell have a much longer life span and will often outlast the environment in which they operate.

The older bells which were made from  cast iron were susceptible to [[rust]]ing in certain environments. The new bells made from 316 spun steel have no problem with rust and are ideal for sterile environments such as found in the food industry or in pharmaceutical plants.

Acoustic cleaning began in the early 1970s with experiments using  ship horns or [[air raid siren]]s.  The first acoustic cleaners  were made from [[cast iron]]. From 1990 onwards the technology became commercially viable and began to be used in dry processing, storage, transport, power generation and manufacturing industries. The latest technology uses 316 spun stainless steel to ensure optimum performance.

==Operation and performance==
The majority of acoustic cleaners operate in the audio frequency range from 60 [[hertz]] up to 420 Hz. However a few operate in the [[infrasonic]] range, below 40 Hz, which is mostly below the human hearing range, to satisfy strict [[noise control]] requirements.
There are three scientific fields which converge in the understanding of acoustic cleaning technology.
*Sound propagation. This relates to an understanding of the nature of the sound waves, how they vary and how they will interact with the environment.
*Mathematics of the environment. [[Materials science]], surface [[friction]], [[distance]] and areas familiar to a mechanical engineer.
*[[Chemical engineering]]. The chemical properties of the powder or substance to be debonded. Especially the auto adhesive properties of the powder.
An acoustic cleaner will  create a series of very rapid and powerful sound induced pressure fluctuations which are then transmitted into the solid particles of ash, [[dust]], granules or powder. This causes them to move at differing speeds and debond from adjoining particles and the surface that they are adhering to. Once they have been separated then the material will fall off due to [[gravity]] or it will be carried away by the process gas or air stream. 

The key features which determine whether or not an acoustic cleaner will be effective for any given problem are the particle size range, the [[moisture content]] and the [[density]] of the particles as well as how these characteristics will change with temperature and time.
Typically particles between 20 micrometres and 5&amp;nbsp;mm with moisture content below 8.5% are ideal. Upper temperature limits are dependent upon the melting point of the particles and acoustic cleaners have been employed at temperatures above 1000 C to remove ash build-up in boiler plants.

It is important to match the operating frequencies to the requirements. Higher frequencies can be directed more accurately whilst lower frequencies will carry further, and are generally used for more demanding requirements. A typical selection of frequencies available would be as follows:

*420 Hz for a small acoustic cleaner which might be used to clear bridging at the base of a silo.
*350 Hz will be more powerful and this frequency can be used to unblock material build-up in ID (induced draft) fans, filters, cyclones, mixers, dryers and coolers.
*230 Hz. At this frequency, the power involved is sufficient to use in most [[electricity generation]] applications.
*75 Hz and 60 Hz. These are generally the most powerful acoustic cleaners and are often used in large vessels and [[Storage silo|silo]]s.

==Health and safety==
The introduction of acoustic cleaners has been a significant improvement in many areas of [[health and safety]]. For instance in [[Storage silo|silo]] cleaning - the previous solutions tended to be intrusive or destructive. Air cannons, [[soot blower]]s, external vibrators, hammering or costly man entry are all superseded by noninvasive sonic horns.
An acoustic cleaner requires no down time and will operate during normal usage of the site.
Taking the example of silo cleaning a little further, there are two typical problems.

===Bridging===
This is when the silo blocks at the outlet. Previously the problem was addressed by manual cleaning from underneath the silo which in its turn introduced significant risk from falling material when the blockage was cleared. An acoustic cleaner is able to operate from the top of a silo through in situ material to clear the blockage at the base.

===Rat holing===
Compaction on the side of a silo. This not only reduces the operating volume in a silo but it also compromises quality control by disrupting the first in first out cycle. Older material compacted on the side of a silo can also start to degrade and produce dangerous gases. An acoustic cleaner will produce sound waves which will make the compacted material resonate at a different rate to the surrounding environment resulting in debonding and clearance.

==Advantages of acoustic cleaners==
*Repetitive use during operations means that there are fewer unscheduled shut downs.
*Improved material flow by the elimination of hang-ups, blocking and bridging.
*Minimisation of cross contamination by ensuring complete emptying of the environment.
*Improved cleaning and reduction of health and safety risks.
*Increased energy efficiency. Reducing the buildup on heat exchange surfaces results in lower energy usage.
*Extended plant life. Aggressive cleaning regimes are avoided.
*Ease of operation. It is easy to automate the horns either at regular intervals or to tie the sounding in to changes in their environment such as pressure or flow rates.
*Importantly they prevent the material buildup problem from occurring in the first place.

These advantages mean that the financial payback is often very quick.

It is also possible to compare acoustic cleaners directly to alternative solutions.

*Air cannons. These are well established but are expensive with limited coverage thus requiring multi unit purchase. They are also noise intrusive and have a high compressed air consumption.
*Vibrators. These are easy to fit to an empty silo but can cause structural damage as well as contributing to powder compaction.
*Low friction linings. These are very quiet but are expensive to install. Also they are prone to erosion and can then contaminate the environment or product.
*Inflatable pads and liners. Again these are easy to install in an empty silo. They help side wall buildup but have no impact on bridging. They are also hard to maintain and can cause compaction.
*Fluidisation through a 1 way membrane. This can help already compacted material. However they are expensive and difficult to install and maintain. They can also contribute to mechanical interlocking and bridging.

==Specific applications for acoustic cleaners==
*[[Boiler]]s. Cleaning of the heat transfer surfaces.
*[[Electrostatic precipitator]]s. Acoustic cleaners are being used for cleaning hoppers, turning vanes, distribution plates, collecting plates and electrode wires.
*[[Super heater]]s, economisers and air heaters.
*Duct work. 
*Filters. Acoustic cleaners are used on reverse air, pulse jet and shaker units. They are effective in reducing pressure drop across the collection surface which will increase bag life and prevent hopper pluggage. Generally they can totally replace the both reverse air fans and shaker units and significantly reduce the compressed air requirement on pulse jet filters.
*ID fans.   Acoustic cleaning helps to provide a uniform cleaning pattern even for inaccessible parts of the fan. This maintains the balance of the fan.
*[[Kiln]] inlet. Acoustic cleaners help to prevent particulate buildup at the [[kiln]] inlet and this will minimise nose ring formation.
*Mechanical pre Collectors. Acoustic cleaners help prevent buildup around the impellers and between the tubes.
*Mills. Acoustic cleaners help maintain material flow and also prevent blockages in the pre grind silos. They also help prevent material buildup in the downstream separators and fans.
*Planetary Coolers. Acoustic cleaners help prevent bridging and ensure complete evacuation.
*Precipitator. Acoustic cleaners help clean the turning vanes, distribution plates, collecting plates and electrode wires. They can either assist or replace the mechanical rapping systems. They also prevent particulate buildup in the under hoppers which would otherwise result in opacity spiking.
*Pre heaters.  Used in towers, gas risers, cyclones and fans.
*Ship cargo holds. Used both to clean and de aerate current loads.
*[[Silo cleaning|Silos and hoppers]].  To prevent bridging and rat holing.
*Static cyclones. Acoustic cleaners will work both within the cyclone and with the associated duct work.

The '''Association française de mécanique (AFM)''', French Association of Mechanics, was created in 1997 by the union of 17 scientific and engineers societies covering the disciplines of [[mechanics]]. It was promoted by the High Mechanical Committee (HCM), with the decisive support of the [http://www.fim.net/fr/sites-fim/accueil Federation of Mechanical Industries (FIM)], the [http://www.cetim.fr/fr Technical Center of Mechanical Industries (CETIM)] and the University Association in Mechanics (AUM) for the academic part. It is a forum for information, exchange and reflection for the mechanical community: business leaders, [[engineer]]s, technicians, researchers, professors, mechanical experts. Its main objective is to promote activities and achievements in the main fields of mechanics.

The AFM's operating mode, through its 19 scientific and technical groups (GST) and Commissions, its transversal thematic groups (GTT), the organization of conferences, congress, publication of newsletters and an indexed international journal [http://www.mechanics-industry.org Mechanics &amp; Industry], aims at the transfer of knowledge and more particularly promotes the "transfer of technologies" from research to industry. It is also meant to represent French mechanics in front of its foreign counterparts. AFM is the referring partner of the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research for all research activities in Mechanics and in close collaboration with the [https://cnfm.wordpress.com French National Committee of Mechanics] (CNFM) which is the link for France with IUTAM (International Union of theoretical and Applied Mechanics).

The AFM organizes every two years a national conference entitled [https://cfm2017.sciencesconf.org French Congress of Mechanics] gathering more than 1000 participants. It is at the initiative of a [http://www.edp-open.org/images/stories/books/fulldl/livre-blanc-de-la-recherche-en-mecanique.pdf " Livre blanc de la Mécanique "], which identifies the scientific and technological locks remaining to be lifted in the field.

== The presidents of Association Française de Mécanique ==
Since 1997, eight presidents have successively headed the association. The current president is Eric Arquis, elected in March 2016.

'''Blast chilling''' is a method of cooling food quickly to a low temperature that is relatively safe from [[bacteria]]l growth. Bacteria multiply fastest between +8&amp;nbsp;°C (46&amp;nbsp;°F) and +68&amp;nbsp;°C (154&amp;nbsp;°F). By reducing the temperature of cooked food from +70&amp;nbsp;°C (158&amp;nbsp;°F) to +3&amp;nbsp;°C (37&amp;nbsp;°F) or below within 90 minutes, the food is rendered safe for storage and later consumption. This method of preserving food is commonly used in food [[catering]] and, recently, in the preparation of 'instant' foods, as it ensures the safety and the quality of the food product.&lt;ref name=Bassett&gt;{{cite book|last=Bassett|first=W.H. (ed.)|title=Clay's Handbook of Environmental Health|year=1999|publisher=E &amp; FN Spon|location=London|isbn=0419229604|edition=18th|page=622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blast chiller is a cousin of the [[refrigerator]], another appliance designed to store food between +3&amp;nbsp;°C and +5&amp;nbsp;°C, but the blast chiller is a higher grade and more expensive appliance and is usually only found in commercial kitchens. As of 2013, in the UK, blast chillers are typically priced from [[GBP]] 2,000 to GBP 8,000 excluding VAT.

Use of blast chillers is prescribed for the restaurants of the [[European Union]], e.g. in the regulations 852/2004&lt;ref&gt;Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:139:0001:0054:en:PDF pdf])&lt;/ref&gt; or 853/2004.&lt;ref&gt;Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for the hygiene of foodstuffs ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:139:0001:0054:en:PDF pdf])&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[combustion]], a '''Burke–Schumann flame''' is a type of [[diffusion flame]], established at the mouth of the two concentric ducts, by issuing fuel and oxidizer from the two region respectively. It is named after S.P. Burke and T.E.W. Schumann,&lt;ref&gt;Burke, S. P., and T. E. W. Schumann. "Diffusion flames." Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry 20.10 (1928): 998–1004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeldovich, I. A., Barenblatt, G. I., Librovich, V. B., &amp; Makhviladze, G. M. (1985). Mathematical theory of combustion and explosions.&lt;/ref&gt; who were able to predict the flame height and flame shape using their simple analysis of infinitely fast chemistry (which is now called as [[Burke–Schumann limit]]) in 1928.

==Mathematical description&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. (2018). Combustion theory. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. (1965). Combustion Theory: the fundamental theory of chemical reacting flow systems. Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;==
Consider a cylindrical duct with axis along &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction with radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; through which fuel is fed from the bottom and the tube mouth is located at &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt;. Oxidizer is fed along the same axis, but in the concentric tube of radius &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; outside the fuel tube. Let the [[Fuel mass fraction|mass fraction]] in the fuel tube be &lt;math&gt;Y_{Fo}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]] of the oxygen in the outside duct be &lt;math&gt;Y_{Oo}&lt;/math&gt;. Fuel and oxygen mixing occurs in the region &lt;math&gt;z&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. The following assumptions were made in the analysis:
* The average velocity is parallel to axis (&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction) of the ducts, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}= v \mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;
*The mass flux in the axial direction is constant, &lt;math&gt;\rho v=\mathrm{constant}&lt;/math&gt;
*Axial diffusion is negligible compared to the transverse/radial diffusion
* The flame occurs infinitely fast ([[Burke–Schumann limit]]), therefore flame appears as a '''reaction sheet''' across which properties of flow changes
* Effects of gravity has been neglected

Consider a one-step irreversible [[Arrhenius law]], &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Fuel}+s\mathrm{O}_2\rightarrow (1+s)\mathrm{Products}+q&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of oxygen required to burn unit mass of fuel and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of heat released per unit mass of fuel burned. If &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the number of moles of fuel burned per unit volume per unit time and introducing the non-dimensional fuel and mass fraction and the Stoichiometry parameter,

:&lt;math&gt;y_F = \frac{Y_F}{Y_{Fo}},\quad y_O = \frac{Y_O}{Y_{Oo}},\quad S = \frac{sY_{Fo}}{Y_{Oo}}&lt;/math&gt;

the governing equations for fuel and oxidizer mass fraction reduce to
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\rho D_T}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r\frac{\partial y_F}{\partial r}\right) - \rho v\frac{\partial y_F}{\partial z} = \frac{\omega}{Y_{Fo}} \\
\frac{\rho D_T}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r\frac{\partial y_O}{\partial r}\right) - \rho v\frac{\partial y_O}{\partial z} = S\frac{\omega}{Y_{Fo}} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where [[Lewis number]] of both species is assumed to be unity and &lt;math&gt;\rho D_T&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be constant, where &lt;math&gt;D_T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermal diffusivity]]. The boundary conditions for the problem are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\text{at}\, &amp;z=0,\, 0&lt;r&lt;a,\, y_F=1,\, y_O=0,\\
\text{at}\, &amp;z=0,\, a&lt;r&lt;b,\, y_F=0,\, y_O=1,\\
\text{at}\, &amp;r=b,\, 0&lt;z&lt;\infty,\, \frac{\partial y_F}{\partial r}=0,\, \frac{\partial y_O}{\partial r}=0.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The equation can be linearly combined to eliminate the non-linear reaction term &lt;math&gt;\omega/Y_{Fo}&lt;/math&gt; and solve for the new variable

:&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{Sy_F-y_O+1}{S+1}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''mixture fraction'''. The mixture fraction takes the value of unity in the fuel stream and zero in the oxidizer stream and it is a scalar field which is not affected by the reaction. The equation satisfied by &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r\frac{\partial Z}{\partial r}\right) - \frac{\rho v}{\rho D_T}\frac{\partial Z}{\partial z}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the following coordinate transformation

:&lt;math&gt;\xi = \frac{r}{b}, \quad \eta = \frac{\rho D_T}{\rho v} \frac{z}{b^2}, \quad c= \frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;

reduces the equation to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\xi}\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi}\left(\xi\frac{\partial Z}{\partial \xi}\right) - \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \eta}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding boundary conditions become

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\text{at}\, &amp;\eta=0,\, 0&lt;\xi&lt;c,\, Z=1,\\
\text{at}\, &amp;\eta=0,\, c&lt;\xi&lt;1,\, Z=0,\\
\text{at}\, &amp;\xi=1,\, 0&lt;\eta&lt;\infty,\, \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \xi}=0.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The equation can be solved by separation of variables

:&lt;math&gt;Z(\xi,\eta) = c^2 + 2c \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\lambda_n} \frac{J_1(c\lambda_n)}{J_0^2(\lambda_n)} J_0(\lambda_n \xi)e^{-\lambda_n^2\eta}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J_1&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Bessel function of the first kind]] and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_n&lt;/math&gt; is the nth root of &lt;math&gt;J_1(\lambda)=0.&lt;/math&gt; Solution can also be obtained for the planar ducts instead of the axisymmetric ducts discussed here.

==Flame shape and height==
In the [[Burke-Schumann limit]], the flame is considered as a thin reaction sheet outside which both fuel and oxygen cannot exist together, i.e., &lt;math&gt;y_Fy_O=0&lt;/math&gt;. The reaction sheet itself is located by the stoichiometric surface where &lt;math&gt;Sy_F=y_O&lt;/math&gt;, in other words, where

:&lt;math&gt;Z_s = \frac{1}{S+1}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z_s&lt;/math&gt; is the stoichiometric mixture fraction. Therefore, for given values of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, the flame shape &lt;math&gt;f(\xi,\eta)=0&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the following equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{S+1}=c^2 + 2c \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\lambda_n} \frac{J_1(c\lambda_n)}{J_0^2(\lambda_n)} J_0(\lambda_n \xi)e^{-\lambda_n^2\eta}.&lt;/math&gt;

The reaction sheet separates fuel and oxidizer region. On the fuel side of the reaction sheet &lt;math&gt;y_F = (Z/Z_s-1)/S,\, y_O=0&lt;/math&gt; and on the oxidizer side &lt;math&gt;y_F=0,\, y_O = 1-Z/Z_s.&lt;/math&gt; When &lt;math&gt;S\gg 1&lt;/math&gt;, the flame extends from the mouth of the inner tube to some height at the outer tube ('''under-ventilated case''') and when &lt;math&gt;S\rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt;, the flame starts from the mouth of the inner tube and joins at the axis at some height away from the mouth ('''over-ventilated case'''). Similar results are obtained when &lt;math&gt;S&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. The flame height can be estimated approximately by keeping only the first term of the series (it give accurate results because it appears in the exponential) by setting &lt;math&gt;\xi=0&lt;/math&gt; for the over-ventilated case and &lt;math&gt;\xi=1&lt;/math&gt; for the under-ventilated case. This approximation predicts the flame height to be

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\eta &amp;= \frac{1}{\lambda_1^2}\ln \left[\frac{2c J_1(c\lambda_1)}{(Z_s-c^2)\lambda_1 J_0(\lambda_1)}\right],\quad \text{under-ventilated} \\
\eta &amp;= \frac{1}{\lambda_1^2}\ln \left[\frac{2c J_1(c\lambda_1)}{(Z_s-c^2)\lambda_1 J_0^2(\lambda_1)}\right],\quad \text{over-ventilated},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1=3.83.&lt;/math&gt; The inner structure of the reaction sheet is described by [[Liñán's equation#Large Damköhler number|Liñán's equation]].

CBERS-2 was a {{convert|1450|kg|lb|adj=on}} spacecraft built by the [[China Academy of Space Technology]] and based on the [[Phoenix-Eye 1]] [[satellite bus]].&lt;ref name="gsp"/&gt; The spacecraft was powered by a single solar array, which provided 1,100&amp;nbsp;watts of electricity for the satellite's systems.&lt;ref name="EOP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbers.inpe.br/ingles/satellites/description_cbers1_2_2b.php|title=CBERS-1, 2 and 2B Description|publisher=INPE|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument suite aboard the CBERS-2 spacecraft consisted of three systems: the Wide Field Imager (WFI) produced visible-light to near-infrared images with a resolution of {{convert|260|m}} and a swath width of {{convert|890|km}}; a high-resolution CCD camera was used for multispectral imaging at a resolution of {{convert|20|m}} with a swath width of {{convert|113|km}}; the third instrument, the Infrared Multispectral Scanner (IMS), had a resolution of {{convert|80|m}} and a swath width of {{convert|120|km}}.&lt;ref name="cameras"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbers.inpe.br/ingles/satellites/cameras_cbers1_2_2b.php|title=CBERS-1, 2 and 2B Cameras|publisher=INPE|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Long March 4B|Chang Zheng 4B]] carrier rocket, operated by the [[China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology]], was used to launch CBERS-2. The launch took place at 03:16 UTC on 21 October 2003, using [[Taiyuan Launch Complex 7|Launch Complex 7]] at the [[Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center|Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre]].&lt;ref name="launchlog"/&gt; The satellite was successfully placed into a [[sun-synchronous orbit]].&lt;ref name="UCS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nwgs/UCS_Satellite_Database_7-1-10.txt|title=UCS Satellite Database|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate=1 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909133456/http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nwgs/UCS_Satellite_Database_7-1-10.txt|archivedate=9 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the launch of [[CBERS-2B]] in 2007, CBERS-2 was retired from service.&lt;ref name="EOP"/&gt; As of 1 December 2013, the dericict satellite remains in orbit, with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|780|km|mi}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|782|km|mi}}, 98.17&amp;nbsp;degrees inclination and a [[orbital period|period]] of 100.33&amp;nbsp;minutes. Its orbit has a [[semimajor axis]] of {{convert|7152.64|km|mi}}, and [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.0001886.&lt;ref name="n2yo"/&gt;

'''Clock Software''' is a private limited company developing software and hardware [[solution]]s for the [[hospitality industry]] - property management system, restaurant point of sale, online booking engine, channel manager, self-service kiosk, mobile hotel app. Its headquarters is in London, UK.

== History ==
Clock Software was incorporated in 1994 in [[Varna]], [[Bulgaria]], under the name Clock Ltd (Клок ООД). Initially, the company specialized in selling hardware and peripherals but soon switched its focus to the development of hotel software. In 1996 Clock launched their first property management system - ClockFront for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. At the time, a huge privatisation was going on as part of the transition of the country to [[democracy]] and [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ivanov|first1=Stanislav H|last2=Dimitrova|first2=Miroslava|title=Tourism Management and Planning in Bulgaria|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228245420_Tourism_Management_and_Planning_in_Bulgaria|website=Researchgate|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All hotels, previously owned by the state, were changing ownership and needed new software to replace previous, often centralised, management systems. Clock Software took the chance to offer their software to the newly privatised hotels.&lt;ref name="Clockwork Evolution"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Spasov, Spas|title=Еволюция по часовник|trans-title=Clockwork Evolution|url=http://www.capital.bg/biznes/predpriemach/2010/11/26/1000860_evoljuciia_po_chasovnik/|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=www.capital.bg|issue=Entrepreneur|date=November 26, 2010|language=bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Clock Software started to expand to countries outside Bulgaria and opened offices in Romania (2007) and Croatia (2008). The first markets where their products were adopted were Romania, Macedonia and Croatia.&lt;ref name="Clockwork Evolution" /&gt;

In 2010 Clock took the decision to create a completely new hospitality software suite based on [[cloud technology]]. The new product was built around the idea of consolidation of separate applications into one cloud-based platform and switching from data-focused to guest-centered software model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Традиционният хотелски софтуер е мъртъв|trans-title=Traditional hotel software is dead|url=http://www.horemag.bg/print.php?storyid=1014935|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=HOtels &amp; REstaurants MAGazine|date=December 21, 2010|language=bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cloud Hotel PMS: A paradigm shift from managing rooms to engaging with guests|url=https://www.raconteur.net/business/cloud-hotel-pms-a-paradigm-shift-from-managing-rooms-to-engaging-with-guests|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=Future of Hospitlaity report|publisher=Raconteur Media|date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new branch was registered in [[London, UK]] under the name of Clock Software Ltd. to take over the international development and the distribution of the cloud-based software products, while the Bulgarian branch remained in charge of software development and support.
Clock Software launched their first cloud product, the free Internet reservation system InnHand, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clock launched new online booking software (in Bulgarian)|url=http://www.subway.bg/admin/resources/uploaded/News/CapitalDaily-2012-06-14-103.pdf|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=CapitalDaily|date=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Prabu, Karthick|title=InnHand brings mobile, web and Facebook reservation system for B&amp;Bs, guest houses, villas - Tnooz|url=https://www.tnooz.com/TLabs-InnHand-mobile-web-Facebook-reservation-system-for-Bed-Breakfast-inns-guest-houses-villas|work=Tnooz|issue=The TLabs Showcase|date=February 26, 2013|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 they launched the hotel management platform Clock PMS. A year later InnHand was discontinued and the company focused entirely on the new system. In 2016, the company released their first hardware device, a self-service kiosk.

== Distribution and partners ==
Its Windows-based installable software solutions Clock Software offers in Eastern Europe, while the latest cloud-based hotel management platform, Clock PMS, is available globally. Clock PMS has customers in 50+ countries (as of end of 2016) with [[Lark Hotels]] and [[McMillan Hotels]] among them. In 2015 Clock PMS was featured in the annual report by [[Software Advice]] "Hotel Software User View report - 2015"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Short|first1=Taylor|title=Hotel Management Software UserView - 2015|journal=Software Advice|date=April 13, 2015|url=http://www.softwareadvice.com/hotel-management/userview/report-2015/|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 Clock Software was included in the [[Grant Thornton]]'s report "Emerging clouds in hotel technology | Spotlight on cloud-based PMS"  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Emerging clouds in hotel technology - Spotlight on cloud-based PMS|publisher=[[Grant Thornton]] UK LLP|page=9|url=http://www.grantthornton.co.uk/globalassets/1.-member-firms/united-kingdom/pdf/publication/2016/emerging-clouds-in-hotel-technology.pdf|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="797">'''Constrained-layer damping''' is a mechanical engineering technique for suppression of vibration.  Typically a [[viscoelastic]] or other [[damping]] material, is sandwiched between two sheets of [[stiffness |stiff]] materials that lack sufficient damping by themselves. The ending result is, any vibration made on either side of the constraining materials (the two stiffer materials on the sides) are trapped and evidently dissipated in the [[viscoelastic]] or middle layer.

'''Craster kippers''' are [[kipper]]s from the [[Northumberland]] village of [[Craster]]. They have been acclaimed as the best British kipper.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Background==

Like the [[Newmarket sausage]] or the [[Stornoway black pudding]], the Craster kipper (sometimes called by aficionados simply "the Craster"&lt;ref name="wfi"&gt;{{cite book|title=Waitrose Food Illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60wsAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=6 December 2012|date=January 2001|publisher=John Brown Contract Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
) is a British food named after, and strongly associated with, its place of origin. Although the [[herring]]s used for Craster kippers may not be strictly local,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Northumbria Papers (Great Britain Guides)
| page = 23
| quote = Craster oak-smoked kippers are famous, but the fresh fish is bought in from elsewhere
| first = David
| last = Winpenny
| year = 1997
| publisher = McGraw-Hill
| isbn =978-0-8442-4882-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the defining characteristic of the Craster kipper is that the [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking process]] takes place in a smokehouse located in or around the village of [[Craster]].

[[Clarissa Dickson Wright]] has named Craster as the birthplace of the kipper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| first =Clarissa
| last = Dickson Wright
| authorlink=Clarissa Dickson Wright
| title = Clarissa's England: A gamely gallop through the English counties
| publisher = Hodder &amp;amp; Stoughton
| quote = If you go up the coast further you will come to Craster, the birthplace of the kipper
| year = 2012
| isbn = 978-1-444-72909-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is. however. some dispute over this&amp;nbsp;– [[Kipper#Origin|other places]], including the nearby town of [[Seahouses]], also claim this distinction.

==Preparation and characteristics==

Although a long-standing tradition in Craster, commercial kipper production is currently only continued there by L. Robson &amp;amp; Sons, using their 100-year-old smokehouses.&lt;ref name="Gogarty2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Gogarty|title=The Coast Road: A 3,000 Mile Journey Round the Edge of England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GHa5dd_2IAC&amp;pg=PA194-IA6|accessdate=6 December 2012|date=28 April 2008|publisher=Anova Books|isbn=978-1-905798-09-4|pages=194–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The preparation process begins with selected raw [[North Sea]] herrings, known locally as "silver darlings".&lt;ref name="Country Life"&gt;{{cite book|title=Country Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AnJBAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 December 2012|date=May 2002|publisher=Country Life, Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are split, gutted and washed,&lt;ref name="Griffiths2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bill Griffiths|title=Stotty 'n' Spice Cake: The Story of North East Cooking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJukEurOHLkC&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=6 December 2012|year=2006|publisher=Northumbria University Press|isbn=978-1-904794-13-4|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; soaked in [[brine]], and then taken to the smokehouse where they are cured over smouldering oak and white wood shavings for sixteen hours.&lt;ref name="Hall2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gemma Hall|title=Bradt Slow Northumberland &amp;amp; Durham: Including Newcastle, Hadrian's Wall and the Coast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5MrGPQVf3MoC&amp;pg=PA78%7Caccessdate%3D6+December+2012%7Cdate%3D18+September+2012%7Cpublisher%3DBradt+Travel+Guides%7Cisbn%3D978-1-84162-433-4%7Cpages%3D78%E2%80%93%7D%7D%3C%2Fref%3E|accessdate=6 December 2012|date=18 September 2012|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-433-4|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous smokehouse is unmistakable — a stone building often with white plumes pouring out of the wooden vents in the roof.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

In appearance a Craster kipper is still recognizably a fish; the head is preserved and the natural colours of the skin are tanned golden by the oak smoke.&lt;ref name="wfi"/&gt; The flesh has a distinctive reddish-brown colour.&lt;ref name="McCloyWhitehorne2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew McCloy|author2=Stephen Whitehorne|title=Coastal Walks Around Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_DeVm9-SIt8C&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=6 December 2012|date=30 January 2009|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=978-1-84773-127-2|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gastronomic properties==

It has been said that comparing the Craster kipper with a common commercial processed kipper is like "comparing a fillet steak with a cheap burger",&lt;ref name="wfi"/&gt; and that "on the tongue, the [Craster] kipper is as delicate, as sophisticated, as the finest smoked salmon in the world and costs but a fraction of the price."&lt;ref name="conn"&gt;{{cite journal
| journal = The Connoisseur
| year=1984
| volume = 214
| issue = 863-868
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craster kippers have been described as "the best",{{cn|date=September 2016}} although that claim has also been made of other British kippers such as [[Loch Fyne]] kippers.&lt;ref name="RoseMacaroon2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lesley Anne Rose|author2=Michael Macaroon|author3=Vivienne Crow|title=Frommer's Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5FCopF4sjlkC&amp;pg=PA28|accessdate=6 December 2012|date=28 November 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-97259-4|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5550">A '''cryogenic oxygen plant''' is an industrial facility that creates [[molecular oxygen]] at relatively high purity. [[Oxygen]] is the most common [[Chemical element|element]] in the earth's crust&lt;ref&gt;Nave, R. [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tables/elabund.html Abundances of the Elements in the Earth's Crust], Georgia State University&lt;/ref&gt; and the second largest industrial gas. This process was pioneered by [[Carl von Linde|Dr. Carl von Linde]] in 1902.
[[File:LOX80.JPG|thumb|300px|Liquid Oxygen plant with production rate of 80 Nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/hour]]

==Purpose==
The cryogenic air separation achieves high purity oxygen of more than 99.5%. The resulting high purity product can be stored as a liquid and/or filled into [[Gas cylinder|cylinders]]. These cylinders can even be distributed to customer in the medical sector, [[welding]] or mixed with other gases and used as breathing gas for [[Scuba diving|diving]].
Typical production ranges from 50  [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|normal m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]/hour up to 860,000 Nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/hour ([[Ras Laffan]] refinery).

==Plant modules==
A cryogenic oxygen plant comprises:

===Warm end (W/E) container===
*[[Gas compressor|Compressor]]
*[[Air receiver]]
*Chiller ([[Heat exchanger]])
*Pre-[[Air filter|filter]]
*[[Air purification unit]] (APU)

===Coldbox===
*Main [[heat exchanger]]
*[[Boiler]]
*[[Fractionating column|Distillation column]]
*Expansion brake [[turbine]]

===Storage===
*[[storage tank|Liquid oxygen tank]]
*Vapouriser
*Filling station

==How the plant works==
[[File:SchemeLOX.jpg|thumb|650px|[[Process flow diagram|Flowsheet]] Liquid Oxygen (LOX) Plant]]

===Warm end process===
Atmospheric air is roughly filtered and pressurised by a compressor, which provides the product pressure to deliver to the customer. The amount of air sucked in depends on the customer’s oxygen demand.

The air receiver collects condensate and minimises pressure drop. The dry and compressed air leaves the air to refrigerant [[heat exchanger]] with about 10°C.

To clean the process air further, there are different stages of [[filtration]]. First of all, more condensate is removed, then a [[Coalescer|coalescing filter]] acts as a gravity filter and finally an [[adsorber]] filled with activated carbon removes some [[hydrocarbon]]s.

The last [[unit process]] in the warm end container is the [[thermal swing adsorber]] (TSA). The Air purification unit cleans the compressed process air by removing any residual water vapour, [[carbon dioxide]] and [[hydrocarbons]]. It comprises two vessels, valves and exhaust to allow the changeover of vessels. While one of the TSA beds is on stream the second one is regenerated by the waste gas flow, which is vented through a silencer into the ambient environment.

===Coldbox process===
The process air enters the main [[heat exchanger]] in the coldbox where it is cooled in counter flow with the waste gas stream. After leaving the main heat exchanger the process air has a temperature of about –112°C and is partly liquefied. The complete liquefaction is achieved through [[evaporation]] of cooled liquid oxygen in the [[boiler]]. After passing a purity control valve process air enters on tip of the [[Fractionating column|distillation column]] and flows down through the packing material.

The steam of evaporated oxygen vapour in the shell of the boiler vents back into the distillation column. It rises through the column packing material and encounters the descending stream of liquid process air.

The liquid air descending down the column loses [[nitrogen]]. It becomes richer in oxygen and collects at the base of the column as pure [[liquid oxygen]]. It flows out into the boiler to the cold box liquid product valve. An on-line oxygen analyser controls the opening of the liquid product [[valve]] to transfer pure low-pressure liquid oxygen into the [[storage tank]].

The rising oxygen vapour becomes rich in [[nitrogen]] and [[argon]]. It leaves the column and exits the cold box at ambient temperature through the main heat exchanger as a waste gas. This waste  gas provides purge gas to regenerate the TSA unit and to the cool the refrigeration [[turbine]].

Turbines located at the base of the cold box provide refrigeration for the process. A stream of high-pressure gas from the main heat exchangers is cooled and expanded to low pressure in the turbine. This cold air returns to the waste stream of the [[heat exchanger]] to inject refrigeration.
Energy removed by the turbine re-appears as heat in the turbine’s closed-cycle air-brake circuit. This heat is removed in an air-to-air [[Intercooler|cooler]] by waste gas from the cold box.

===Storage and vaporising process===
Liquid from the tank is compressed to high pressure in a cryogenic liquid [[pump]]. It is then vaporised in an ambient air [[evaporator]] to produce gaseous oxygen. The high-pressure gas then can pass into cylinders via the [[Inlet manifold|gas manifold]] or fed into a customers product pipeline.

A '''decorative box''' is a form of packaging that is generally more than just functional, but also intended to be decorative and artistic. Many such [[box]]es are used for promotional [[packaging]], both commercially and privately. Historical objects are usually called [[casket]]s if larger than a few inches in more than one dimension, with only smaller ones called boxes.

==Gift box==
Traditionally gift boxes used for promotional and seasonal [[gifts]] are made from sturdy [[paperboard]] or [[corrugated fiberboard]]. These boxes normally consist of a base and detachable [[lid (container)|lid]] and are made by using a die cutting process to cut the board. The box is then covered with decorative [[paper]]. Gift boxes can be dressed with other gift [[packaging]] material, such as decorative [[ribbon]]s and gift [[tissue paper]].

==Work box==
The most common type of decorative box is the feminine work box. It is usually fitted with a tray divided into many small compartments for [[Sewing needle|needle]]s, reels of [[silk]] and [[cotton]], and other necessaries for [[Sewing|stitchery]]. The date of its origin is unclear, but 17th-century examples exist, covered with silk and adorned with beads and [[embroidery]].

No lady would have been without her work box in the 18th century. In the second half of that century, elaborate pains were taken to make these boxes dainty and elegant.

Work boxes are ordinarily portable, but at times they form the top of a stationary table.

==Jewelry Box==
[[Image:Jewel box.JPG|thumb|A jewel box lined with red velvet]]
A jewelry box, also known as a [[casket]], is a receptacle for trinkets, not only [[Gemstone|jewel]]s. It may take a very modest form, covered in [[leather]] and lined with [[satin]], or it may reach the monumental proportions of the jewel cabinets which were made for [[Marie Antoinette]], one of which is at [[Windsor Castle]], and another at the [[Palace of Versailles]]; the work of Schwerdfeger as cabinetmaker, Degault as miniature-painter, and Thomire as [[Repoussé and chasing|chaser]].

Snuff boxes are made in two sizes, ones for the pocket and communal boxes made for table use. Pocket boxes are usually made to hold a small amount of [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] for immediate consumption. High-quality boxes have tightly-sealed lids to ensure that air does not penetrate the box, although wholly air-tight boxes are a rarity. Pocket boxes are intended keep a day or two's supply. Table boxes are still to be found in the mess of certain old regiments – often in the traditional 'ram's head' style – and a communal snuff box is kept in the House of Lords in the UK parliament.[[Image:Copper snuffbox.jpg|thumb|Coffin-shaped snuff box made from sheet copper, raised, tinned inside and engraved.

One of the more functional types of decorative boxes is the [[snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] box. Snuff boxes are made in pocket sizes – holding a few grammes for immediate consumption – and as larger, table boxes. Whilst snuff does not enjoy the popularity it once did, it is gradually re-gaining popularity due to the demonisation of smoking and snuff boxes are still made in surprising numbers. Since prolonged exposure to air causes snuff to dry out and lose its quality, pocket snuff boxes are designed to be nearly airtight containers with strong hinges, generally with enough space for a days' worth of snuff only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Phillips Griffiths |url=http://www.snuffbox.org.uk/hto.htm |title=snuff boxes and handkerchiefs |publisher=Snuffbox.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

People of all social classes used these boxes when snuff was at its peak of popularity and the wealthy carried a variety of fancy snuff-boxes created by craftsmen in metal-work, [[jeweller]]s and [[vitreous enamel|enameller]]s.  Some of these were elaborately made and decorated,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/302147838|title=Great Collections : treasures from Art Gallery of NSW, Australian Museum, Botanic Gardens Trust, Historic Houses Trust of NSW, Museum of Contemporary Art, Powerhouse Museum, State Library of NSW, State Records NSW.|last=A.)|first=McPhee, John (John|last2=NSW.|first2=Museums and Galleries|publisher=Museums &amp; Galleries NSW|year=|isbn=9780646496030|location=|pages=57|oclc=302147838|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; rich in detail and made from precious or expensive materials such as gold, silver and ivory and were often adorned with artwork, gems and precious stones. Boxes made for the poorer snuff taker were more ordinary; popular and cheap boxes were made in papier-mâché and even [[potato]]-pulp, which made durable boxes that kept the snuff in good condition. Alloys that resembled gold or silver were developed in the 18th and 19th centuries such as the ''ersatz'' gold [[Pinchbeck (alloy)|Pinchbeck]] and the silver look-alike, [[Sheffield Plate]].

Other popular materials used in making these boxes include:
* [[Tortoiseshell material|Tortoise-shell]], a favorite material owing to its satin lustre;
* [[Mother-of-pearl]], which was kept in its natural iridescent state, or gilded, or used together with [[silver]]; and
* Boxes made from exotic materials such as cowrie shells, enriched with enamels or set with diamonds or other precious stones.
The lids were often adorned with a [[portrait]], a classical [[vignette (graphic design)|vignette]], [[portrait miniature]], [[hardstone]] [[inlay]]s, or [[micromosaic]] panel.  Some of the most expensive just used subtly different colours of gold. Perhaps the most widely used semi-precious metal was silver and snuffs of all shapes and sizes were made in that metal during snuff's great popularity.

Even after snuff-taking ceased to be a general habit, the practice lingered among [[diplomat]]s, doctors, lawyers and other professionals as well as members of professions where smoking was not possible, such as miners and print workers and snuff still has a considerable following, particularly amongst ex-smokers. Monarchs retained the habit of bestowing snuff-boxes upon [[ambassador]]s and other intermediaries as a form of honor. As [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] explained, the diplomatic corps found a ceremonious pinch to be a useful aid to reflection in a business interview. At the coronation of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] of England, Messrs. [[Rundell and Bridge, (jewellers)|Rundell and Bridge]], the court jewellers, were paid £8,205 for snuff-boxes for gifts to foreign representatives.

Today snuffboxes are collected at many levels – the high-end of the market being reserved for gold boxes that have been jewelled or have original art work on them, or boxes with provenance linking them to world figures, such as Napoleon or Lord Nelson. Some of the most expensive are French and German 18th century examples, and the record auction price for a German box is £789,250 (about US$1.3 million), bid in 2003 at [[Christie's]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/departments/gold-boxes-and-objects-of-vertu/ |title=Christie's |publisher=Christies.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern snuff boxes are made from a variety of woods, pewter and even plastic and are manufactured in surprising numbers due, largely, to snuff's resurgence amongst tobacco connoisseurs and ex-smokers.

(Historical sources Hugh McCausland and Matoon Curtis separate books both entitled 'Snuff and Snuff Boxes')

==Strong box==
[[Image:Barriere - Snuffbox with the Family of Louis XV - Walters 57136 - Top.jpg|thumb|This snuffbox is decorated with images of the children of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and queen [[Marie Leszczyńska|Marie Leszczynska]]: [[Louise Élisabeth of France|Louise-Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Marie Adélaïde of France|Marie-Adelaide]].]]

A strong-box is a receptacle for [[money]], [[deed]]s and [[security (finance)|securities]]. Its place has been taken in modern life by the [[safe]]. Some have extremely elaborate locks, such as [[Thomas Bodley|Sir Thomas Bodley]]'s strong-box in the [[Bodleian library]], which has a locking mechanism in the under-side of the lid.

==Knife box==
In the Middle Ages people usually brought their own cutlery with them when eating away from home, and the more expensive types came with their own custom-made leather cases, stamped and embossed in various designs.  Later, as cutlery became provided by the host, decorative cases, especially for the knives, were often left on display in the dining-room. Some of the most elegant and often ornate were in the styles of [[Robert Adam]], [[George Hepplewhite]] and [[Thomas Sheraton]]. Occasionally flat-topped containers, they were most frequently either rod-shaped, or tall and narrow with a sloping top necessitated by a series of raised veins for exhibiting the handles of knives and the bowls of spoons. [[Mahogany]] and [[satinwood]]s were most common, occasionally inlaid with [[marquetry]], or edged with [[buxus|boxwood]] which was resistant to chipping. These receptacles, often made in pairs, still exist in large numbers; they are often converted into stationery cabinets. Another version is an open tray or rack, usually with a handle, also for the storage of table cutlery.

==Bible box==
A Bible box is a box made to hold a [[Bible]]. These boxes started being manufactured in the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

[[Fabergé]] created the [[Necessaire Egg]] as an étui.

==Wooden wine box==
Wooden wine boxes, also known as wooden wine crates, are used to ship and store expensive wines in transit and cellarage. Most wineries that use wooden boxes burn their logo and designs on the front panel. Originally intended as purely practical items, these panels or the whole box are often used by bars or wine collectors as decorative pieces for their bars or wine cellars. A typical wooden wine box holds either six or twelve 750 ml bottles.

In computing, the '''delete''' [[character (computing)|character]] (sometimes also called '''rubout''') is the last character in the [[ASCII]] repertoire, with the code [[127 (number)|127]] ([[decimal]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://rubout.askdefine.com/ definition of the rubout character 7F hex]&lt;/ref&gt; Not a [[graphic character]] but a [[control character]], it is denoted as &lt;code&gt;^?&lt;/code&gt; in [[caret notation]] and has a graphic representation of &amp;#x2421; in [[Unicode]] (as all ASCII control characters have graphic representations).

On modern systems terminal emulators typically turn keys marked "Delete" or "Del" into an [[ANSI escape code|escape sequence]] such as &lt;code&gt;^[[3~&lt;/code&gt;. Terminal emulators may produce DEL when {{keypress|Backspace}} key or {{keypress|Control}}+{{keypress|Backspace}}  or {{keypress|Control}}+{{keypress|?}} are typed, and some programs such as [[Microsoft Notepad|Notepad]] may insert this character with the same key presses.

This code was originally used to mark deleted characters on [[punched tape]], since any character could be changed to all ones by punching holes everywhere. If a character was punched erroneously, punching out all seven bits caused this position to be ignored or deleted, a computer version of [[correction fluid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert C.

For teleprinters like the [[Teletype Model 33]], lines were commonly ended by the three characters [[carriage return|CR]], [[line feed|LF]], and rubout, with the rubout allowing time for the print mechanism to physically move to the left margin. On [[VT100]] compatible terminals, this is the character generated by the key labeled Delete, which transmits a delete character (octal 177, hexadecimal 7F) to the host system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VT100 Family of Video Terminals|url=http://www.vt100.net/docs/tp83/chapter5.html|publisher=vt100.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VT100 User Guide- Chapter 3 – Table 3-4 Function Key Codes|url=http://www.vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/table3-4.html|publisher=vt100.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[VT510]] compatible terminals, this is the character  generated by the key labeled ?, usually called backspace on modern machines, and does not correspond to the PC "Delete" key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VT510 Video Terminal Programmer Information – Chapter 8 – Keyboard Processing|url=http://www.vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/chapter8|publisher=vt100.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current use ==
[[Unix-like]] operating systems are known to use it as [[stty|{{mono|erase}}]] control character, i.e. to delete the previous character in the [[line mode]]. This, though, differs from its original function where this code replaced (physically) characters on a punched tape to be deleted.

[[DOS]]/[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] never used this character in any way, using the [[backspace]] (0x08, or control-H) to delete the previous character. [[VGA-compatible text mode|EGA/VGA fonts]], as fonts used by [[Win32 console]], usually have the [[Miscellaneous Technical (Unicode block)|"house" symbol]] ⌂ at 127 (0x7F) code point, see [[Code page 437]] for details. However, its legacy can be seen in some applications distributed as part of the Windows operating system: as an example, typing the {{keypress|[[Control key|Control]]}} and {{keypress|[[Backspace]]}} key combination in [[Microsoft Notepad]] will output the delete character.

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''design rationale''' is an explicit documentation of the [[reason]]s behind [[Decision making|decisions]] made when [[design]]ing a [[system]] or [[Artifact (software development)|artifact]]. As initially developed by W.R. Kunz and [[Horst Rittel]], design rationale seeks to provide [[argumentation]]-based structure to the political, collaborative process of addressing [[wicked problems]].&lt;ref name="Kunz, W. 1970"/&gt;

== Overview ==
A design rationale is the explicit listing of [[Decision making|decisions]] made during a [[design process]], and the reasons why those decisions were made.&lt;ref name="Jarczyk, Alex P. 1992 pp. 577-586"&gt;Jarczyk, Alex P.; Löffler, Peter; Shipman III, Frank M. (1992), "Design Rationale for Software Engineering: A Survey", ''25th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences'', 2, pp. 577-586&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary goal is to support [[designer]]s by providing a means to [[document|record]] and [[communicate]] the argumentation and reasoning behind the design process.&lt;ref name="HoAt06"&gt;Horner, J.; Atwood, M.E. (2006), "Effective Design Rationale: Understanding the Barriers", in Dutoit, A.H.; McCall, R.; Mistrík, I. et al., Rationale Management in Software Engineering, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 73-90&lt;/ref&gt; 
It should therefore include:&lt;ref name="Lee97"&gt;Lee, J. (1997). "Design Rationale Systems: Understanding the Issues". ''IEEE Expert'' 12 (3): 78–85&lt;/ref&gt;
* the reasons behind a design decision,
* the justification for it,
* the other alternatives considered, 
* the trade offs evaluated, and 
* the argumentation that led to the decision.

Several science areas are involved in the study of design rationales, such as [[computer science]]&lt;ref name="Jarczyk, Alex P. 1992 pp. 577-586"/&gt;  [[cognitive science]],&lt;ref name="HoAt06" /&gt; [[artificial intelligence]],&lt;ref name="BuBr00"&gt;Burge, J.E.; Brown, D.C. (2000), "Reasoning with Design Rationale", in Gero, J., ''Artificial Intelligence in Design '00'', Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publ., pp. 611–629&lt;/ref&gt; and [[knowledge management]].&lt;ref&gt;Xin, W.; Guangleng, X. (2001), "Design Rationale as Part of Corporate Technical Memory", ''Systems, Man and Cybernetics'', pp. 1904 - 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; For supporting design rationale, various frameworks have been proposed, such as QOC, DRCS, [[Issue-Based Information System|IBIS]], and DRL.

== History ==
While argumentation formats can be traced back to [[Stephen Toulmin]]'s work in the 1950s&lt;ref name="Toul50"&gt;[[Stephen Toulmin]] (1958). ''The Uses of Argument''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; datums, claims, warrants, backings and rebuttals, the origin of design rationale can be traced back to W.R. Kunz and [[Horst Rittel]]'s&lt;ref name="Kunz, W. 1970"&gt;Kunz, W.; Rittel, H. (1970), ''Issues as elements of information systems''. Working Paper 131, Center for Urban and Regional Development, University of California Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; development of the [[Issue-Based Information System]] (IBIS) notation in 1970. Several variants on IBIS have since been proposed.

* The first was Procedural Hierarchy of Issues (PHI), first described in Ray McCall's PhD Dissertation&lt;ref&gt;McCall, R. (1978), ''On the structure and use of issue systems in design'', Doctoral Dissertation, University of California, Berkeley, University Microfilms&lt;/ref&gt; although not named at the time.
* IBIS was also modified, in this case to support Software Engineering, by Potts &amp; Bruns.&lt;ref name="PoBu88"&gt;Potts, C.; Burns, G. (1988), "Recording the reasons for design decisions", ''10th International Conference on Software Engineering'' (ICSE '1988), pp. 418-427&lt;/ref&gt; The Potts &amp; Bruns approach was then extended by the Decision Representation Language (DRL).&lt;ref&gt;Lee, J. (1991), "Extending the Potts and Bruns model for recording design rationale", ''Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE '13)'', IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA, pp. 114-125&lt;/ref&gt; which itself was extended by RATSpeak.&lt;ref name="BuBr00" /&gt;
* Questions Options and Criteria (QOC), also known as Design Space Analysis&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, A.; Young, RM.; Moran, T. (1989), "Design rationale: the argument behind the artifact", ''SIGCHI Bull''. 20, pp. 247-252114-125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, A.; Young, RM.; Bellotti, VME.; Moran, T. (1996), "Questions, Options, and Criteria: Elements of Design Space Analysis", in Moran, T.; Carroll, J., ''Design Rationale Concepts, Techniques, and Use, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates'', pp. 53-106&lt;/ref&gt; is an alternative representation for argumentation-based rationale, as are Win-Win&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Boehm]], Ross, R (1989). "Theory-W software project management: principles and examples.". ''IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering'' 18 (7): 902-916.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Decision Recommendation and Intent Model (DRIM).&lt;ref name="Pena-Mora, F. 1993 pp. 213-221"&gt;Pena-Mora, F.; Sriram, D.; Logcher, R. (1993), "SHARED-DRIMS: SHARED Design Recommendation-Intent Management System", ''Proceedings Enabling Technologies Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprise'', IEEE Press, Morgantown, WV, pp. 213-221&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Rationale Management System (RMS) was PROTOCOL, which supported PHI, which was followed by other PHI-based systems MIKROPOLIS and PHIDIAS. The first system providing IBIS support was [[:de:Hans Dehlinger|Hans Dehlinger]]'s STIEC.&lt;ref&gt;Dehlinger, H. (1978), Project STIEC: Systems Analysis of the Generation and Dissemination of Scientific and Technological Information in the European Community" ''Report No. 26: Report on a Batch - Version of STIEC'', Heidelberg/Stuttgart&lt;/ref&gt; Rittel developed a small system in 1983 (also not published) and the better known [[gIBIS]] (graphical IBIS) was developed in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Conklin, J.; YakemBegemanovic, M. (1988). "gIBIS: A hypertext tool for exploratory policy discussion". ''ACM Transactions on Office Information Systems'' 6 (4): 303-331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all successful DR approaches involve structured argumentation. For example, Carroll and Rosson's Scenario-Claims Analysis approach&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, JM; Rosson, M (1992). "Getting around the task-artifact cycle: how to make claims and design by scenario". ''ACM Trans. Inf. Syst''. 10 (2): 181-212&lt;/ref&gt; captures rationale in scenarios that describe how the system is used and how well the system features support the user goals. Carroll and Rosson's approach to design rationale is intended to help designers of computer software and hardware identify underlying design tradeoffs and make inferences about the impact of potential design interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, J. M., &amp; Rosson, M. B. (2003). Design rationale as theory. HCI models, theories, and frameworks: toward a multidisciplinary science, 431-461.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts in design rationale ==
There are a number of ways to characterize DR approaches. Some key distinguishing features are how it is captured, how it is represented, and how it can be used.

=== Rationale capture ===
''Rationale capture'' is the process of acquiring rationale information to a rationale management

; Capture methods
* A method called "Reconstruction"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; captures rationales in a raw form such as video, and then reconstruct them into a more structured form.&lt;ref name="BuBr98"&gt;Burge, J.; Brown, D.C. (1998), [http://web.cs.wpi.edu/Research/aidg/DR-Rpt98.html ''Design Rationale: Types and Tools, Technical Report''], [http://web.cs.wpi.edu/Research/aidg/DR-Rpt98.html Worchester Polytechnic Institute, Computer Science Dept.], retrieved on 27 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of Reconstruction method is that rationales can be carefully captured and capturing process won't disrupt the designer. But this method might result in high cost and biases of the person producing the rationales 
* The "Record-and-replay"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; method simply captures rationales as they unfold. Rationales are synchronously captured in a [[video conference]] or asynchronously captured via [[bulletin board]] or email-based discussion. If the system has informal and semi-formal representation, the method will be helpful.
* The "Methodological byproduct"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; method captures rationales during the process of design following a schema. But it's hard to design such a schema. The advantage of this method is its low cost.
* With a rich knowledge base (KB) created in advance, the "Apprentice"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; method captures rationales by asking questions when confusing or disagreeing with the designer's action. This method benefits not only the user but the system.
* In "Automatic Generation"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; method, design rationales are automatically generated from an execution history at low cost. It has the ability in maintaining consistent and up-to-date rationales. But the cost of compiling the execution history is high due to the complexity and difficulty of some machine-learning problems.
* The "Historian"&lt;ref&gt;Chen, A.; McGinnis, B.; Ullman, D.; Dietterich, T. (1990), "Design History Knowledge Representation and Its Basic Computer Implementation", The 2nd International Conference on Design Theory and Methodology, Chicago, IL, pp. 175-185&lt;/ref&gt; method let a person or computer program watches all designer's actions but does not make suggestions. Rationales are captured during the design process.&lt;ref name="BuBr98" /&gt;

=== Rationale representation ===
The choice of design rationale representation is very important to make sure that the rationales we capture is what we desire and we can use efficiently. According to the degree of formality, the approaches that are used to represent design rationale can be divided into three main categories: informal, semiformal, or formal.&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; In the informal representation, rationales can be recorded and captured by just using our traditionally accepted methods and media, such as word processors, audio and video records or even hand writings. However, these descriptions make it hard for automatic interpretation or other computer-based supports. In the formal representation, the rationale must be collected under a strict format so that the rationale can be interpreted and understood by computers. However, due to the strict format of rationale defined by formal representations, the contents can hardly be understood by human being and the process of capturing design rationale will require more efforts to finish, and therefore becomes more intrusive.

Semiformal representations try to combine the advantages of informal and formal representations. On one hand, the information captured should be able to be processed by computers so that more computer based support can be provided. On the other hand, the procedure and method used to capture information of design rationale should not be very intrusive. In the system with a semiformal representation, the information expected is suggested and the users can capture rationale by following the instructions to either fill out the attributes according to some templates or just type into natural language descriptions.&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt;

=== Argumentation-based models ===
; The Toulmin model : One commonly accepted way for semiformal design rationale representation is structuring design rationale as argumentation.&lt;ref name="BuBr00" /&gt; The earliest argumentation-based model used by many design rationale systems is the Toulmin model.&lt;ref name="Toul50" /&gt; The [[Stephen Toulmin#The Toulmin Model of Argument|Toulmin model]] defines the rules of design rationale argumentation with six steps:&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Chris (2000), [http://www.concentric.net/~Creyn266/COMM335/Toulmin.htm ''What is the Toulmin Model?''] Paper at concentric.net.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:# Claim is made; 
:# Supporting data are provided; 
:# Warrant provides evidence to the existing relations; 
:# Warrant can be supported by a backing; 
:# Model qualifiers (some, many, most, etc.) are provided; 
:# Possible rebuttals are also considered. 
:One advantage of Toulmin model is that it uses words and concepts which can be easily understood by most people.

; Issue-Based Information System (IBIS) : Another important approach to argumentation of design rationale is Rittel and Kunz's IBIS ([[Issue-Based Information System]]),&lt;ref name="Kunz, W. 1970" /&gt; which is actually not a software system but an argumentative notation. It has been implemented in software form by [[gIBIS]] (graphical IBIS), itIBIS (test-based IBIS), [[Compendium (software)|Compendium]], and other software.&lt;ref&gt;Conklin, J.; Yakemovic, K. (1991). "A Process-Oriented Approach to Design Rationale". ''Human-Computer Interaction'' 6 (3 &amp; 4): 357–391.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last1=Rittel |first1=Horst W. J. |authorlink1=Horst Rittel |last2=Noble |first2=Douglas |date=January 1989 |title=Issue-based information systems for design |number=492 |location=Berkeley, CA |institution=Institute of Urban and Regional Development, [[University of California]] |oclc=20155825 |url=http://cumincad.architexturez.net/system/files/pdf/ca71.content.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBIS uses some rationale elements (denoted as nodes) such as issues, positions, arguments, resolutions and several relationships such as more general than, logical successor to, temporal successor to, replaces and similar to, to link the issue discussions.

; Procedural Hierarchy of Issues (PHI) : PHI (Procedural Hierarchy of Issues)&lt;ref&gt;McCall, R.J. (1991). "PHI: A Conceptual Foundation for Design Hypermedia". ''Design Studies'' 12 (1): 30–41.&lt;/ref&gt; extended IBIS to noncontroversial issues and redefined the relationships. PHI adds the subissue relationship which means one issue's resolution depends on the resolution of another issue.

; Questions, Options, and Criteria (QOC) : QOC (Questions, Options, and Criteria)&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, A.; Young, RM.; Bellotti, VME.; Moran, T. (1996), "Questions, Options, and Criteria: Elements of Design Space Analysis", in Moran, T.; Carroll, J., ''Design Rationale Concepts, Techniques, and Use'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, pp. 53-106&lt;/ref&gt; is used for design space analysis. Similar to IBIS, QOC identifies the key design problems as questions and possible answers to questions as options. In addition, QOC uses criteria to explicitly describe the methods to evaluate the options, such as the requirements to be satisfied or the properties desired. The options are linked with criteria positively or negatively and these links are defined as assessments.

; Decision Representation Language (DRL) : DRL (Decision Representation Language)&lt;ref name="Lee91"&gt;Lee, J. (1991), "Extending the Potts and Bruns model for recording design rationale", ''Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Software Engineering'' (ICSE '13), IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA, pp. 114-125&lt;/ref&gt; extends the Potts and Bruns model of DR&lt;ref name="PoBu88" /&gt; and defines the primary elements as decision problems, alternatives, goals, claims and groups. Lee (1991) has argued that DRL is more expressive than other languages.&lt;ref name="Lee91" /&gt; DRL focuses more on the representation of decision making and its rationale instead of on design rationale.

; RATSpeak : Based on DRL, RATSpeak is developed and used as the representation language in SEURAT (Software Engineering Using RATionale).&lt;ref&gt;Burge, J. (2005), [http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/ETD/Available/etd-050205-085625/ ''Software Engineering Using design RATionale''], Worchester Polytechnic Institute, Computer Science Dept&lt;/ref&gt; RATSpeak takes into account requirements (functional and non-functional) as part of the arguments for alternatives to the decision problems. SEURAT also includes an Argument Ontology which is a hierarchy of argument types and includes the types of claims used in the system.

; WinWin Spiral Model :  The WinWin Spiral Model, which is used in the WinWin approach,&lt;ref name="BoKi06"&gt;[[Barry Boehm]]; Kitapci, H. (2006), "The WinWin Approach: Using a Requirement Negotiation Tool for Rationale Capture and Use", in Dutoit, A.H.; McCall, R.; Mistrík, I. et al., ''Rationale Management in Software Engineering'', Springer Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 173-190&lt;/ref&gt; adds the WinWin negotiation activities, including identifying key stakeholders of the systems, and identifying the win conditions of each stakeholder and negotiation, into the front of each cycle of the [[Spiral model|spiral software development model]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Boehm]] (1998). [http://www.cs.usu.edu/~supratik/CS%205370/r5061.pdf "A spiral model of software development and enhancement"]. ''Computer'' 21 (5): 61–72&lt;/ref&gt; in order to achieve a mutually satisfactory (winwin) agreement for all stakeholders of the project.

: In the WinWin Spiral Model, the goals of each stakeholder are defined as Win conditions. Once there is a conflict between win conditions, it is captured as an Issue. Then the stakeholders invent Options and explore trade-offs to resolve the issue. When the issue is solved, an Agreement which satisfies the win conditions of stakeholders and captures the agreed option is achieved. Design rationale behind the decisions is captured during the process of the WinWin model and will be used by stakeholders and the designers to improve their later decision making.&lt;ref name="BoKi06" /&gt; The WinWin Spiral model reduces the overheads of the capture of design rationale by providing stakeholders a well-defined process to negotiate. In&lt;ref&gt;Bose, P. (1995). "A Model for Decision Maintenance in the WinWin Collaboration Framework". ''Knowledge Based Software Engineering '' (KBSE '95).&lt;/ref&gt; an ontology of decision rationale is defined and their model utilizes the ontology to address the problem of supporting decision maintenance in the WinWin collaboration framework.

; Design Recommendation and Intent Model (DRIM) : DRIM (Design Recommendation and Intent Model) is used in SHARED-DRIM.&lt;ref name="Pena-Mora, F. 1993 pp. 213-221" /&gt; The main structure of DRIM is a proposal which consists of the intents of each designer, the recommendations that satisfy the intents and the justifications of the recommendations. Negotiations are also needed when conflicts exist between the intents of different designers. The recommendation accepted becomes a design decision, and the rationale of the unaccepted but proposed recommendations are also recorded during this process, which can be useful during the iterative design and/or system maintenance.

== Applications ==
Design rationale has the potential to be used in many different ways. One set of uses, defined by Burge and Brown (1998),&lt;ref name="BuBr98" /&gt; are:
* Design verification — The design rationale can be used to verify if the design decisions and the product itself are the reflection of what the designers and the users actually wanted.
* Design evaluation — The design rationale is used to evaluate the various design alternatives discussed during the design process.
* Design maintenance — The design rationale helps to determine the changes that are necessary to modify the design.
* Design reuse — The design rationale is used to determine how the existing design could be reused for a new requirement with or without any changes in it. If there is a need to modify the design, then the DR also suggests what needs to be modified in the design.
* Design teaching — The design rationale could be used as a resource to teach people who are unfamiliar with the design and the system.
* Design communication — The design rationale facilitates better communication among people who are involved in the design process and thus helps to come up with a better design.
* Design assistance — The design rationale could be used to verify the design decisions made during the design process.
* Design documentation — The design rationale is used to document the entire design process which involves the meeting room deliberations, alternatives discussed, reasons behind the design decisions and the product overview.

DR is used by research communities in software engineering, mechanical design, artificial intelligence, civil engineering, and human-computer interaction research. In software engineering, it could be used to support the designers ideas during requirement analysis, capturing and documenting design meetings and predicting possible issues due to new design approach.&lt;ref name="DMM06"&gt;Dutoit, A.; McCall, B.; Mistrik et al., eds. (2006), ''Rationale Management in Software Engineering'', Springer pp.1-48.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[software architecture]] and outcourcing solution design, it can justify the outcome of [[architectural decision]]s and serve as a design guide.&lt;ref&gt;O. Zimmermann, C. Miksovic, J. Küster, [http://soadecisions.org/download/SDA-JSS-SpecialIssueWICSA2011v16FinalAuthorsVersion.pdf Reference Architecture, Metamodel and Modeling Principles for Architectural Knowledge Management in Information Technology Services]. Journal of Systems and Software, Elsevier. Vol. 85, Issue 9, Sept. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
In civil engineering, it helps to coordinate the variety of work that the designers do at the same time in different areas of a construction project. It also help the designers to understand and respect each other's ideas and resolve any possible issues.&lt;ref&gt;Whelton, Michael; Ballard, Glenn; Tommelein, Iris (2007) [http://www.leanconstruction.org/pdf/DesignRationaleSystemsandProjectDefinitionIGLC9.pdf ''Application Of Design Rationale Systems To Project Definition – Establishing A Research Project''.] Retrieved on 27 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The DR can also be used by the project managers to maintain their project plan and the project status up to date. Also, the project team members who missed a design meeting can refer back the DR to learn what was discussed on a particular topic. The unresolved issues captured in DR could be used to organize further meetings on those topics.&lt;ref name="DMM06" /&gt;
 
Design rationale helps the designers to avoid the same mistakes made in the previous design. This can also be helpful to avoid duplication of work.&lt;ref name="BuBr00" /&gt; In some cases DR could save time and money when a software system is upgraded from its previous versions.&lt;ref name="Jarczyk, Alex P. 1992 pp. 577-586" /&gt;

There are several books and articles that provide excellent surveys of rationale approaches applied to HCI,&lt;ref&gt;Moran, T.; Carroll, J., eds. (1996), ''Design Rationale Concepts, Techniques, and Use'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering Design&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; and Software Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Dutoit, Rationale Management in Software Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''destoner''' is a machine that removes stones and clods from [[hilling|soil ridges]] and moves them to the [[furrow]] so that the ridges are free from stones. This also helps when harvesting in wet conditions as the harvester can drive on a row of stones which helps improve traction.

They remove stone using a series of webs (between two and five webs). The stones stay on the web and the clay falls through it. The stones travel through the machine and the bigger stones fall into a boulder box and the smaller stones fall onto a cross conveyor and in turn fall into a trench. On the next pass the tractor tramps these stones down.

Destoners are usually fitted with steerable wheels which makes them more maneuverable on [[Headland_(agriculture)|headland]]s. Some are fitted with hydraulic leveling.

[[File:Babbage Difference Engine.jpg|thumb|320px| The London [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]]'s difference engine, the first one actually built from Babbage's design. The design has the same precision on all columns, but when calculating polynomials, the precision on the higher-order columns could be lower.]]

A '''difference engine''' created by [[Charles Babbage]] is an automatic [[mechanical calculator]] designed to tabulate [[polynomial|polynomial functions]]. Its name is derived from the method of [[divided differences]], a way to interpolate or tabulate functions by using a small set of [[polynomial]] coefficients. Most [[mathematical function]]s commonly used by engineers, scientists and navigators, including [[logarithm]]ic and [[trigonometric functions]], can be [[Taylor series|approximated]] by polynomials, so a difference engine can compute many useful [[mathematical table|tables of numbers]].

The historical difficulty in producing error-free tables by teams of mathematicians and [[Human computer|human "computers"]] spurred [[Charles Babbage]]'s desire to build a mechanism to automate the process.

[[File:Difference engine Scheutz.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Per Georg Scheutz's third difference engine]]
The notion of a [[mechanical calculator]] for mathematical functions can be traced back to the [[Antikythera mechanism]] of the 2nd century BC, while early modern examples are attributed to [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] in the 17th century. 
In 1784 [[J. H. Müller]], an engineer in the [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] army, devised and built an [[adding machine]] and described the basic principles of a difference machine in a book published in 1786 (the first written reference to a difference machine is dated to 1784),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-02-24|title=Differenzmaschine|url=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differenzmaschine#Johann_Helfrich_von_M.C3.BCller|journal=Wikipedia|language=de|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was unable to obtain funding to progress with the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Johann Helfrich von Müller, ''Beschreibung seiner neu erfundenen Rechenmachine, nach ihrer Gestalt, ihrem Gebrauch und Nutzen'' [Description of his newly invented calculating machine, according to its form, its use and benefit] (Frankfurt and Mainz, Germany:  Varrentrapp Sohn &amp; Wenner, 1786); pages 48-50.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This machine used the decimal number system and was powered by cranking a handle. The [[British government]] was interested, since producing tables was time-consuming and expensive and they hoped the difference engine would make the task more economical.&lt;ref name="Campbell-Kelly 2004"&gt;{{cite book|title=Computer: A History of the Information Machine 2nd ed.|last=Campbell-Kelly|first=Martin|publisher=Westview Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-8133-4264-1|location=Boulder, Co|pages=|author-link=Martin Campbell-Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823, the British government gave Babbage £1700 to start work on the project. Although Babbage's design was feasible, the metalworking techniques of the era could not economically make parts in the precision and quantity required. Thus the implementation proved to be much more expensive and doubtful of success than the government's initial estimate. In 1832, Babbage and [[Joseph Clement]] produced a small working model (1/7 of the calculating section of Difference Engine No. 1,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which was intended to operate on 20-digit numbers and sixth-order differences) which operated on 6-digit numbers and second-order differences.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqrItgm351EC&amp;lpg=PA204&amp;dq=Difference%20Engine%20No.%202%20order&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA204#v=onepage&amp;q=Difference%20Engine%20No.%202%20order&amp;f=false|title=A Brief History of Computing|last=O'Regan|first=Gerard|date=2012-03-05|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9781447123590|location=|pages=204|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JckCvpOQDOoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=difference%20engine&amp;f=false|title=The Philosophical Breakfast Club: Four Remarkable Friends Who Transformed Science and Changed the World|last=Snyder|first=Laura J.|date=2011-02-22|publisher=Crown/Archetype|year=|isbn=9780307716170|location=|pages=192, 210, 217|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lady Byron]] described seeing the working prototype in 1833: "We both went to see the thinking machine (for so it seems) last Monday.

By the time the government abandoned the project in 1842,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UmNJAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=difference%20engine%201842&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA387#v=onepage&amp;q=difference%20engine%201842&amp;f=false|title=A History of the Royal Society: With Memoirs of the Presidents|last=Weld|first=Charles Richard|date=1848|publisher=J. W. Parker|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=387–390|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babbage had received and spent over £17,000 on development, which still fell short of achieving a working engine. The government valued only the machine's output (economically produced tables), not the development (at unknown and unpredictable cost to complete) of the machine itself.  Babbage did not, or was unwilling to, recognize that predicament.&lt;ref name="Campbell-Kelly 2004" /&gt; Meanwhile, Babbage's attention had moved on to developing an [[analytical engine]], further undermining the government’s confidence in the eventual success of the difference engine. By improving the concept as an analytical engine, Babbage had made the difference engine concept obsolete, and the project to implement it an utter failure in the view of the government.&lt;ref name="Campbell-Kelly 2004" /&gt;

The incomplete Difference Engine No. 1 was put on display to the public at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] in [[South Kensington]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aDJRAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=difference+Engine+1862+exhibition+babbage&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22difference+Engine%22+1862+exhibition|title=Cyclopaedia of useful arts, mechanical and chemical, manufactures, mining and engineering: in three volumes, illustrated by 63 steel engravings and 3063 wood engravings|last=Tomlinson|first=Charles|date=1868|publisher=Virtue &amp; Co.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=136|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j_QHAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=difference%20Engine%201862%20exhibition%20babbage&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q=difference%20babbage&amp;f=false|title=Official catalogue of the industrial department|last=1862|first=International exhibition|date=1862|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=49|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babbage went on to design his much more general [[Analytical Engine|analytical engine]], but later produced an improved "Difference Engine No. 2" design (31-digit numbers and seventh-order differences),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; between 1846 and 1849. Babbage was able to take advantage of ideas developed for the analytical engine to make the new difference engine calculate more quickly while using fewer parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophical Breakfast Club|last=Snyder|first=Laura J.|publisher=Broadway Brooks|year=2011 |isbn=978-0-7679-3048-2|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Dawn of Innovation: The First American Industrial Revolution |last=Morris |first=Charles R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRQBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |date=October 23, 2012 |publisher=PublicAffairs |isbn=9781610393577 |page=63|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scheutzian calculation engine ===
Inspired by Babbage's difference engine in 1834, [[Per Georg Scheutz]] built several experimental models. In 1837 his son Edward proposed to construct a working model in metal, and in 1840 finished the calculating part, capable of calculating series with 5-digit numbers and first-order differences, which was later extended to third-order (1842). In 1843, after adding the printing part, the model was completed.

In 1851, funded by the government, construction of the larger and improved (15-digit numbers and fourth-order differences) machine began, and finished in 1853. The machine was demonstrated at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|World's Fair in Paris, 1855]] and then sold in 1856 to the Dudley Observatory in Albany, New York&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut1wgt6kSBEC&amp;pg=PA12#v=snippet&amp;q=difference%20engine&amp;f=false|title=Specimens of Tables, Calculated, Stereomoulded, and Printed by Machinery|last=Scheutz|first=George|last2=Scheutz|first2=Edward|date=1857|publisher=Whitnig|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=VIII–XII, XIV-XV, 3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (delivered in 1857).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In 1857 British government ordered next [[Per Georg Scheutz|Scheutz's]] difference machine, which was built in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-08-03|title=[[Bryan Donkin#Difference engine]]|url=|journal=Wikipedia|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7rvAAAAMAAJ|title=The Difference Engine: Charles Babbage and the Quest to Build the First Computer|last=Swade|first=Doron|date=2002-10-29|publisher=Penguin Books|year=|isbn=9780142001448|location=|pages=4,207|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jlmVKZ1psCkC&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=farr%20scheutz%201857&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=farr%20scheutz%201857&amp;f=false|title=The Universal Machine: From the Dawn of Computing to Digital Consciousness|last=Watson|first=Ian|date=2012-05-17|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9783642281020|location=|pages=37–38|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had the same basic construction as the previous one.

[[Martin Wiberg]] improved Scheutz's construction (c. 1859, his machine has the same capacity as Scheutz's - 15-digit and fourth-order) but used his device only for producing and publishing printed tables (interest tables in 1860, and [[logarithm]]ic tables in 1875).&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Clare Archibald: ''Martin Wiberg, his Table and Difference Engine'', Mathematical Tables and Other Aids to Computation, 1947(2:20) 371–374.

American [[George B. Grant]] started working on his calculating machine in 1869, unaware of the works of Babbage and Scheutz (Schentz). One year later (1870) he learned about difference engines and proceed to design one himself, describing his construction in 1871. In 1874 the Boston Thursday Club raised a subscription for the construction of a large-scale model, which was built in 1876.

===Construction of two working No. 2 difference engines===
During the 1980s, [[Allan G. Bromley]], an associate professor at the [[University of Sydney]], [[Australia]], studied Babbage's original drawings for the Difference and Analytical Engines at the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] library in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csdl2.computer.org/persagen/DLAbsToc.jsp?resourcePath=/dl/mags/an/&amp;toc=comp/mags/an/2000/04/a4toc.xml ''IEEE Annals of the History of Computing'', 22(4), October–December 2000].&lt;/ref&gt;  This work led the Science Museum to construct a working calculating section of difference engine No. 2 from 1985 to 1991, under [[Doron Swade]], the then Curator of Computing. This was to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Babbage's birth in 1999. In 2002, the [[Printer (computing)|printer]] which Babbage originally designed for the difference engine was also completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Modern Sequel {{!}}  Babbage Engine {{!}} Computer History Museum |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/modernsequel/ |website=www.computerhistory.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversion of the original design drawings into drawings suitable for engineering manufacturers' use revealed some minor errors in Babbage's design (possibly introduced as a protection in case the plans were stolen),&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/710950.stm Babbage printer finally runs, BBC news quoting Reg Crick] Accessed May 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; which had to be corrected. Once completed, both the engine and its printer worked flawlessly, and still do. The difference engine and printer were constructed to tolerances achievable with 19th-century technology, resolving a long-standing debate as to whether Babbage's design would actually have worked. (One of the reasons formerly advanced for the non-completion of Babbage's engines had been that engineering methods were insufficiently developed in the Victorian era.)

The printer's primary purpose is to produce [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]] plates for use in printing presses, which it does by pressing type into soft plaster to create a [[flong]]. Babbage intended that the Engine's results be conveyed directly to mass printing, having recognized that many errors in previous tables were not the result of human calculating mistakes but from error in the manual [[typesetting]] process.&lt;ref name="Campbell-Kelly 2004" /&gt; The printer's paper output is mainly a means of checking the Engine's performance.

In addition to funding the construction of the output mechanism for the Science Museum's Difference Engine No. 2, [[Nathan Myhrvold]] commissioned the construction of a second complete Difference Engine No. 2, which was on exhibit at the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]] from 10 May 2008 until 31 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/exhibits/babbage/|title=The Babbage Difference Engine No. 2 {{!}} Computer History Museum|website=www.computerhistory.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chm2"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Babbage Engine Demonstration pt. 3.webm|thumb|The Mountain View machine in action]]

The difference engine consists of a number of columns, numbered from '''1''' to '''''N'''''. The machine is able to store one decimal number in each column. The machine can only add the value of a column ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 to column ''n'' to produce the new value of ''n''. Column ''N'' can only store a [[wiktionary:Constant|constant]], column 1 displays (and possibly [[Computer printer|prints]]) the value of the calculation on the current [[iteration]].

The engine is programmed by setting initial values to the columns. Column 1 is set to the value of the polynomial at the start of computation. Column 2 is set to a value derived from the first and higher [[derivative]]s of the polynomial at the same value of '''''X'''''. Each of the columns from 3 to ''N'' is set to a value derived from the &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt; first and higher derivatives of the polynomial.

=== Timing ===
In the Babbage design, one iteration (i.e., one full set of addition and [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]] operations) happens for each rotation of the main shaft. Odd and even columns alternately perform an addition in one cycle. The sequence of operations for column &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is thus:

# Count up, receiving the value from column &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; (Addition step)
# Perform [[carry propagation]] on the counted up value
# Count down to zero, adding to column &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;
# Reset the counted-down value to its original value

Steps 1,2,3,4 occur for every odd column, while steps 3,4,1,2 occur for every even column.

While Babbage's original design placed the crank directly on the main shaft, it was later realized that the force required to crank the machine would have been too great for a human to handle comfortably. Therefore, the two models that were built incorporate a 4:1 reduction gear at the crank, and four revolutions of the crank are required to perform one full cycle.

=== Steps ===
Each iteration creates a new result, and is accomplished in four steps corresponding to four complete turns of the handle shown at the far right in the picture below. The four steps are:

* Step 1. All even numbered columns (2,4,6,8) are added to all odd numbered columns (1,3,5,7) simultaneously. An interior sweep arm turns each even column to cause whatever number is on each wheel to count down to zero. As a wheel turns to zero, it transfers its value to a sector gear located between the odd/even columns. These values are transferred to the odd column causing them to count up. Any odd column value that passes from "9" to "0" activates a [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]] lever.
* Step 2.  [[Carry propagation]] is accomplished by a set of spiral arms in the back that poll the carry levers in a helical manner so that a carry at any level can increment the wheel above by one. That can create a carry, which is why the arms move in a spiral. At the same time, the sector gears are returned to their original position, which causes them to increment the even column wheels back to their original values. The sector gears are double-high on one side so they can be lifted to disengage from the odd column wheels while they still remain in contact with the even column wheels.
* Step 3. This is like Step 1, except it is odd columns (3,5,7) added to even columns (2,4,6), and column one has its values transferred by a sector gear to the print mechanism on the left end of the engine. Any even column value that passes from "9" to "0" activates a carry lever. The column 1 value, the result for the polynomial, is sent to the attached printer mechanism.
* Step 4. This is like Step 2, but for doing carries on even columns, and returning odd columns to their original values.

=== Subtraction ===
The engine represents negative numbers as [[Method of complements|ten's complements]]. Subtraction amounts to addition of a negative number. This works in the same manner that modern computers perform subtraction, known as [[two's complement]].

== Method of differences ==
[[File:Difference engine.JPG|thumb|320px|right|Fully operational difference engine at the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]]]]
The principle of a difference engine is [[Newton polynomial|Newton's method]] of [[divided differences]]. If the initial value of a polynomial (and of its [[finite difference]]s) is calculated by some means for some value of '''''X''''', the difference engine can calculate any number of nearby values, using the method generally known as the '''method of finite differences'''. For example, consider the quadratic [[polynomial]]

: &lt;math&gt;p(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

with the goal of tabulating the values ''p''(0), ''p''(1), ''p''(2), ''p''(3), ''p''(4), and so forth. The table below is constructed as follows: the second column contains the values of the polynomial, the third column contains the differences of the two left neighbors in the second column, and the fourth column contains the differences of the two neighbors in the third column:

{| class="wikitable"
!x!!''p''(''x'') = 2''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 3''x'' + 2!!diff1(''x'') = (&amp;nbsp;''p''(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;p(''x'') )!!diff2(''x'') = (&amp;nbsp;diff1(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;diff1(''x'')&amp;nbsp;)
|-
|0||2||−1||4
|-
|1||1||3||4
|-
|2||4||7||4
|-
|3||11||11||
|-
|4||22|| ||
|}

The numbers in the third values-column are constant. In fact, by starting with any polynomial of degree ''n'', the column number ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 will always be constant. This is the crucial fact behind the success of the method.

This table was built from left to right, but it is possible to continue building it from right to left down a diagonal in order to compute more values.  To calculate ''p''(5) use the values from the lowest diagonal. Start with the fourth column constant value of 4 and copy it down the column. Then continue the third column by adding 4 to 11 to get 15. Next continue the second column by taking its previous value, 22 and adding the 15 from the third column. Thus ''p''(5) is 22&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;15&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;37.  In order to compute ''p''(6), we iterate the same algorithm on the ''p''(5) values: take 4 from the fourth column, add that to the third column's value 15 to get 19, then add that to the second column's value 37 to get 56, which is ''p''(6).  This process may be continued [[ad infinitum]]. The values of the polynomial are produced without ever having to multiply. A difference engine only needs to be able to add. From one loop to the next, it needs to store 2 numbers—in this example (the last elements in the first and second columns).  To tabulate polynomials of degree ''n'', one needs sufficient storage to hold ''n'' numbers.

Babbage's difference engine No. 2, finally built in 1991, could hold 8 numbers of 31 decimal digits each and could thus tabulate 7th degree polynomials to that precision. The best machines from Scheutz could store 4 numbers with 15 digits each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqrItgm351EC&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;ots=SECGXk9jSd&amp;dq=scheutz%204%20numbers%2015%20digits&amp;pg=PA201#v=onepage&amp;q=scheutz%204%20numbers%2015%20digits&amp;f=false|title=A Brief History of Computing|last=O'Regan|first=Gerard|date=2012-03-05|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781447123590|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initial values ==
The initial values of columns can be calculated by first manually calculating N consecutive values of the function and by [[backtracking]], i.e. calculating the required differences.

Col &lt;math&gt;1_0&lt;/math&gt; gets the value of the function at the start of computation &lt;math&gt;f(0)&lt;/math&gt;. Col &lt;math&gt;2_0&lt;/math&gt; is the difference between  &lt;math&gt;f(1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(0)&lt;/math&gt;…&lt;ref name="Thelen"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://ed-thelen.org/bab/bab-intro.html
| title  = Babbage Difference Engine #2 – How to Initialize the Machine -
| accessdate = 2009-01-11
| author = Thelen, Ed
| year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the function to be calculated is a [[polynomial function]], expressed as
: &lt;math&gt; f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \, &lt;/math&gt;
the initial values can be calculated directly from the constant coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' without calculating any data points. The initial values are thus:

* Col &lt;math&gt;1_0&lt;/math&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
* Col &lt;math&gt;2_0&lt;/math&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + … + ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''
* Col &lt;math&gt;3_0&lt;/math&gt; = 2''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 14''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 30''a''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + …
* Col &lt;math&gt;4_0&lt;/math&gt; = 6''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 36''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 150''a''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + …
* Col &lt;math&gt;5_0&lt;/math&gt; = 24''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 240''a''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + …
* Col &lt;math&gt;6_0&lt;/math&gt; = 120''a''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + …
* &lt;math&gt;...&lt;/math&gt;

=== Use of derivatives ===
Many commonly used functions are [[analytic function]]s, which can be expressed as [[power series]], for example as a [[Taylor series]]. The initial values can be calculated to any degree of accuracy; if done correctly the engine will give exact results for first N steps. After that, the engine will only give an [[approximation]] of the function.

The Taylor series expresses the function as a sum obtained from its [[derivative]]s at one point.  For many functions the higher derivatives are trivial to obtain; for instance, the [[sine]] function at 0 has values of 0 or &lt;math&gt;\pm1&lt;/math&gt; for all derivatives. Setting 0 as the start of computation we get the simplified [[Maclaurin series]]
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{n=0}^{\infin} \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\  x^{n}
&lt;/math&gt;

The same method of calculating the initial values from the coefficients can be used as for polynomial functions. The polynomial constant coefficients will now have the value
:&lt;math&gt;
a_n \equiv \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Curve fitting ===
The problem with the methods described above is that errors will accumulate and the series will tend to diverge from the true function. A solution which guarantees a constant maximum error is to use [[curve fitting]]. A minimum of ''N'' values are calculated evenly spaced along the range of the desired calculations. Using a curve fitting technique like [[Gaussian reduction]] an ''N''&amp;minus;1th degree [[polynomial interpolation]] of the function is found.&lt;ref name="Thelen" /&gt; With the optimized polynomial, the initial values can be calculated as above.

== The difference engine in other works ==
William Gibson and Bruce Sterling's ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' is an alternate history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=William|title=The Difference Engine}}&lt;/ref&gt; novel that looks how society would have progressed had the difference engine worked the way Babbage envisioned it.

The story takes places in Victorian England where technological advancement is on the rise. This is due to the effect of the success of Babbage's analytical machine. The convention of [[steampunk]] where Victorian fashion is combined with the technological elements of the Industrial Revolution is seen throughout the story due to technology being so advanced in that era.

'''Dual mode mobiles''' refer to mobile phones that are compatible with more than one form of data transmission or network.

==Dual-Mode Phone==

A dual-mode phone is a [[telephone]] which uses more than one technique for sending and receiving [[Human voice|voice]] and [[Data (computing)|data]]. This could be for wireless [[mobile phones]] or for wired phones.

There are three types of dual mode phones.

===Network Compatibility===
Mobile phones containing two types of cellular [[radio]]s for voice and data. These phones include combination of [[GSM]] and [[CDMA]] technology. They can be used as a GSM or CDMA phone according to the user's preference. These handsets are also called global phones. An example of this is the  [[Samsung]] SCH-A790.

These dual mode handsets are compatible with both [[GSM]] and [[CDMA]] networks and are essentially 2 phones in one device.

Such phones make sense in those countries that have both GSM &amp; CDMA networks or international CDMA roamers who want to keep a single handset with 2 numbers on it.

Most dual mode handsets require two identifying cards (one SIM and one [[RUIM]]), though some dual-mode phones (for example, the iPhone 4S) only require one SIM and one ESN. Not all [[dual SIM]] handsets are dual mode (for example dual SIM GSM phones).

===Cellular and Non-cellular Radios===
Mobile phones contain both cellular and non-cellular radios used for voice and data communication. There are also 2 types of dual mode phones which use cellular radio which will contain GSM/CDMA/W-CDMA as well as other technology like [[IEEE 802.11]] ([[Wi-Fi]]) radio or [[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications|DECT]] (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications) radio. These phones can be used as cellular phones when connected to a wide area cellular network. When within range of a suitable WiFi or DECT network, the phone can be used as a WiFi/DECT phone for all communications purposes. This method of operation can reduce cost (for both the network operator and the subscriber), improve indoor coverage and increase data access speeds.

===Wired Phones===
Wired phones with [[VoIP]] and [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] technology. These phones can be used for making VoIP calls and also used for phones on the circuit switchnetwork. These phones require compatible [[Router (computing)|routers]] and [[modem]] to make VoIP calls.

==List==
[[LG Nexus 5|LG Nexus 5X]]

LG Nexus 6P

Google Pixel &amp; Pixel XL

Google Pixel 2 &amp; Pixel 2 XL

Motorola Moto X4 and Android One Moto X4

[[iPhone 6s]]

[[Image:Durabrand.jpg|thumb|right|Brand logo.]] '''Durabrand''' is a [[private label]] tradename of [[Walmart]] which was introduced in early 1999. It is nowadays available in the UK through ASDA, where it was previously known as Pacific.

==Introduction==
Durabrand was first started in early 1999 as a brand only made for [[Wal-Mart]] stores as a [[generic brand]] for electronics, but has grown to be available near-internationally (due to Wal-Mart's global reach).

Wal-Mart Germany was the first country to introduce the private label with a lineup in Consumer Electronics. Responsible for the first launch in 1999 were Uwe Bremeyer (Senior Buyer Dept. 5) and Michael Werry (Buyer Dept. 5), since 2002 Martin Schulz (Senior Buyer Dept. 5) &amp; Frank Mades (Divisional Merchandise Manager Electronics) for Wal-Mart Germany.
The very first product launched was a 120 min Videocassette produced at RAKS in Manisa (Turkey).

The products are marked for only [[Wal-Mart]] stores and available in very few other stores than Wal-Mart. Like most [[Generic brand|generic]] brands, Durabrand is a chain of different manufacturers. Durabrand is chained with [[Lenoxx Electronics Corporation|Lenoxx Sound]], Alco, [[Funai]] (which would also include [[Emerson Radio Corporation|Emerson]], [[Osram Sylvania|Sylvania]], and Symphonic), [[Orion Electric|Orion]], [[Maxell]], [[Resonance]], Initial Technology, and many other different companies. The prices of a majority of their products are often considered [[Loss-leader|loss leaders]].

Durabrand does have some "company rivals," despite the low prices, their products are matched up between other in-house brands like Wal-Mart's [[ILo Technologies|iLo]] brand (considered as an upmarket brand, offers MP3 digital audio players and plasma video displays), Target's [[Target Corporation|TruTech]] brand; and to an extent, K-Mart's former [[Curtis Mathes Corporation|Curtis Mathes]]/[[White-Westinghouse|White-Westinghouse (in the mid-to-late 1990s)]] now [[Kmart|Home Essentials]] brand. Due to the fact that all of these are store brands, the stores are often competitive to get buyers to their store brand. Aside from store brands, Durabrand is matched up to Coby Electronics, [[Jwin]], GPX, and other low-cost electronics brands. Durabrand offers audio equipment ([[CD players]], alarm clocks, boomboxes, theater systems) and video equipment ([[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]], [[DVD players]], [[televisions]]). However, it has also been lately focused on home appliances such as kitchen equipment, telephones, vacuums, and other general home appliances.

==Products==
* Media ([[CD-R]], [[CD-RW]], [[DVD-R]], [[DVD-RW]], and blank [[VHS]] tapes)
* [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]]
* Home minisystems and [[HTIB|home-theater-in-a-box systems]]
* [[Boombox]]es: Durabrand sells a variety of boomboxes. The offerings range from an AM/FM [[radio]] with a single-deck cassette player to models featuring [[CD players]] and some models with [[MP3]]-CD compatibility.
* [[CD players]] (with and without [[Electronic Skip Protection|ESP]]): Durabrand has variety in portable CD players. Ranging from the basic models without anti-skip protection to models with a built in radio tuner, MP3 CD compatibility, or come supplied with a car kit - consisting of a 12 Volt DC adapter and signal-to-cassette adapter.
* [[DVD Players]]: There are three different types of DVD player that Durabrand sells. One type is the component DVD player that is connects to a TV with A/V inputs (due to being a fire hazard, this product was recalled on August 20, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml09/09335.html&lt;/ref&gt; Another design is a clamshell design portable DVD player (similar to a [[laptop|notebook computer]]). And a car DVD player "system" that can have up to two screens mounted on rear seats.
* [[Televisions]]: Durabrand used to sell monochrome portable televisions (sourced from [[Lenoxx Electronics Corporation]]) but now can only be purchased under the Lenoxx Sound name. Durabrand currently sells moderately sized color televisions (13-inch to 27-inch) manufactured by [[Funai|Funai Electric]].
* Home Appliances: Home appliances include vacuums, hand mixers, coffee makers, wine coolers and other general home equipment.
* [[Telephones]]: Basic models, models with Caller ID and answering systems.
* Car audio: speakers and sets
* Computer speakers
* [[Coffee makers]]
* Two-way radios
* Cordless Vacuum Cleaners

==Brand identification==
A large D is often found on the front of their products.
Silver and black are the predominant colors used on their products.

==Product manufacturers==
* Most portable [[CD players]] and other audio equipment are currently sourced from distributor/supplier [[Lenoxx Electronics Corporation|Lenoxx Sound]].
* Larger stereo systems are often sourced from Alco.
* Televisions were sourced from Orion, currently sourced from [[Funai|Funai Electric]].
* Blank media currently sourced from [[Maxell]] and Plasmon Data Systems.
*Car audio currently sourced from Resonance.
*Some DVD players are sourced from Initial Technology, but some models are also sourced from [[Lenoxx Electronics Corporation|Lenoxx Sound]] and Venturer.

The '''European Association for Architectural Education / Association Européenne pour l'Enseignement de l'Architecture''' (EAAE/AEEA) is a non-profit bilingual (English/French) association that, since 1975, is trying to increase the knowledge and the quality of architectural and urban design education, for the benefit of teachers, students, citizens, and society.  Today, the association counts among its members over 140 European and international schools of architecture, representing some 5000 teaching staff and over 120,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaae.be EAAE/AEEA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==EAAE/AEEA Charter for Architectural Research==
The ''Charter for Architectural Research'' is intended as a reference document for the use of universities, [[architecture school]]s, [[Research institute|research institutions]], funding agencies, and professional practices that are undertaking architectural [[research]]. It specifies the character and objectives of architectural research, confirms the variety of valid methodologies and supports the development of a vibrant, internationally recognized and well funded [[research community]].

The ''Charter'', produced by the EAAE/AEEA Research Committee between 2009 and 2011, consists of two distinct parts : A short "Declaration" approved at the General Assembly in September 2011, and a more detailed "Framework" document, on which work is ongoing, and concerning which comments are of course invited from the community of [[educator]]s and [[researcher]]s in [[architecture]].

===Declaration on Architectural Research===
Architecture is about the '''creation, transformation and interpretation''' of the [[built environment]] and the articulation of space at various scales. It is a discipline involving art, design, conservation, planning, management, construction and representation, addressing issues of ethics, aesthetics, culture and society. The discipline of architecture engages with the cultural, socio-economic and environmental conditions affecting our [[quality of life]].

Architecture is facing challenges of [[climate change]], [[globalisation]], [[urbanisation]] and [[social transformation]] that necessitate vital research. In parallel, the horizons of [[Experimental architecture|architectural experimentation]] are expanding rapidly with the development of new technologies and media. If we are to understand, '''explain, anticipate and influence''' the consequences of these changes, research is essential. Moreover, research is essential for the continued expansion of the discipline’s knowledge base and improvement in teaching, learning and practice of architecture.

The EAAE/AEEA confirms that '''architectural research has a particular knowledge base, tools and methods'''; it confirms the trans-disciplinary nature of architectural research and the legitimacy of a wide range of approaches. Architecture tackles various dimensions of the built environment in a specifically integrative way; the EAAE/AEEA calls for recognition of all appropriate areas and modes of architectural research, for better definition of context and scope and acknowledges research by design as part of the diversity of valid methods with which to research, practice and study architecture.

The generic expectations of '''originality, rigour and significance''' apply to all genres of architectural research. Valid architectural research outputs are as varied as the constantly growing range of research approaches and the EAAE/AEEA recognises installations, experimental projects, proposals, models and actual buildings as such, in addition to written and graphic research outputs. [[Peer review]], communication and international dissemination are crucial and should relate to the nature of the research.

The EAAE/AEEA advocates '''stronger links between theoretical and practice-based research''' and therefore between academia and the profession in the establishment of an expanded arena of architectural research.

In document [[ISO 10303]]-226, a '''fault''' is defined as an abnormal condition or defect at the component, equipment, or sub-system level which may lead to a [[failure]].

In [[telecommunications]], according to the [[Federal Standard 1037C]] of the United States, the term ''fault'' has the following meanings: 
#An accidental condition that causes a [[functional unit]] to fail to perform its required function. See {{section link||Random fault}}.
#A defect that causes a reproducible or catastrophic malfunction. A malfunction is considered reproducible if it occurs consistently under the same circumstances. See {{section link||Systematic fault}}.
# In [[Electric power|power]] systems, an unintentional [[short-circuit]], or partial short-circuit, between energized [[conductor (material)|conductor]]s or between an energized conductor and [[ground (electricity)|ground]].   A distinction can be made between [[Symmetric fault|symmetric]] and [[asymmetric fault]]s. See [[Fault (power engineering)]].

== Random fault ==
A '''random fault''' is a fault that occurs as a result of [[wear]] or other [[Wear|deterioration]]. Whereas the time of a particular occurrence of such a fault cannot be determined, the rate at which such faults occur within the equipment population on average can be predicted with accuracy. Manufacturers will often accept random faults as a risk if the chances are virtually negligible.
A fault can happen in virtually any object or appliance, most common with electronics and machinery.
For example, an [[Xbox 360]] console will deteriorate over time due to dust buildup in the [[Computer fan|fans]]. This will cause the Xbox to overheat, cause an [http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-360/flashing-lights/two-flashinglights error], and shut the console down.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

== Systematic fault ==
'''Systematic faults''' are often a result of an [[error]] in the [[specification]] of the equipment and therefore affect all examples of that type.  Such faults can remain undetected for years, until conditions conduce to create the [[failure]].  Given the same circumstances, each and every example of the equipment would fail identically at that time.

Failures in hardware can be caused by random faults or systematic faults, but failures in [[software]] are always systematic.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

'''Fracking hoses''' are used in [[hydraulic fracturing]] (fracking). Hydraulic fracturing uses between 1.2 and 3.5 million US [[gallon]]s (4.5 and 13 Ml) of water per well, with large projects using up to 5 million US gallons (19 Ml). Additional water is used when wells are refractured; this may be done several times.

==Hose materials==
The traditional solution is to use metal pipes to transfer water but these are costly to deliver and assemble. [[Thermoplastic polyurethane]] (TPU) covered hoses and [[Nitrile rubber]] (NBR) covered hoses have a lot of advantages compared to [[metal]] pipes. It is easy to deliver, assemble and disassemble hoses and long sections of NBR- and TPU-covered hoses reduce the possibility of leakage in connecting parts. These large-diameter NBR- and TPU-covered hoses are called fracking hoses.

==Hose selection==
Fracking hoses are high-pressure, high-strength lay-flat hoses designed for pumping aggressive water around mine sites. Safety and efficiency are important factors when choosing products for these applications.

== History ==
Fracking hoses are solutions derived from the fire hose industries. The fire hose manufacturers manufacture NBR or TPU covered hoses for fire fighting, water discharge, irrigation etc. The fracking industries borrowed the idea from the fire hose industries and use these hoses in fracking.

[[File:Global Open University Campus.jpg|thumb|right|The Global Open University, Dimapur Campus]]

The '''Global Open University''' is an [[India]]n university in the state of [[Nagaland]], with campuses in [[Dimapur]] and [[Kohima]].

==Founding==
The University was founded by the fully sponsoring body President Dr. P. R. Trividi, President, World Institution Building Programme (WIBP),  Reverend Dr. M. Motsuo Ngullie, Founding Father and the first Vice-Chancellor of the Global Open University Nagaland (2007-2008) is the witness signatory between the Government of Nagaland represented by Dr. Edward Lotha, Director of Higher Education and M. Yanrenthung Ngullie, the first Assistant Registrer of TGOUN, Nagaland Peoples Front (NPF) Vice-President, Pinyimthung Patton were the pioneers to established the said University which received the assent of the Hon'le Governor and passed the Global Open University Act 3 of 2006 in [[Dimapur|Wokha as permanent (Main Campus/Headquarter)]] in the state of [[Nagaland]] and campuses in Kohima and Dimapur. As stated above, It has been established under the provisions of The Global Open University Act 2006 (Act 3 of 2006) of the Government of Nagaland with a view to introducing vocational, job oriented and employment centric education in the North-East in general and in the State of Nagaland in particular. The Global Open University, Nagaland has been legislated by the Nagaland State Legislative Assembly under The Global Open University Act 2006 (Act 3 of 2006) which received the assent of the Governor of Nagaland on 30 August 2006 and was notified vide Notification number Law/Act-10/2006 on 18 September 2006. The provisions of The Global Open University Act 2006 were published in the Nagaland Official Gazette on 18 September 2006 for general information.

After much hardship, the third reading in the Nagaland Legislative Assembly and the assent of the Hon'ble Governor was passed and became an act (Act 3 of 2006), the inaugural programme was launched with the courses offered by the TGOUN in the field of higher vocational and professional field.

Hon'ble Minister for Higher Education (2007), Dr. Shurhozelie inaugurated the Global Open University Nagaland, Headquarter: Wokha on 31 May 2007 as the Chief Guest.

In his inaugural speech, Dr. Shurhozelie said education is vital for social development and so is higher education for higher level of development and achievement. He spoke on the successful implementation of communitisation of public institution in the state.

He extended his gratitude to Dr. P. R. Trivedi, Pro-Chancellir Global Open University Nagaland, Headquarter and main campus, Wokha and reverend Dr. Motsuo Ngullie, Vice-Chancellor (2007-2008) who is the brain-child to establish the Global Open University in Nagaland and invested all his potential ability to pursue for establishing TGOUN since 2004 to make it a reality for the larger interest of India and North-East in general and Nagaland in particular in the field of higher education and encourage one and all to become a 'Job giver but not job seeker' and ventured to provide facilities for higher level of vocational and professional learning to the people of Nagaland.

Parliamentary Secretary, Nkhao Lotha also spoke on the occasion and appealed to the citizens of Wokha to extent full support and cooperation to the university.

Dr. P. R. Trivedi announced the views and action plans of TGOU (The Global Open University) Nagaland, Wokha. Reverend Dr. M. Motsuo Ngullie, Vice-Chancellor (2007-2008) gave the welcome speech and brief how he work tirelessly to establish the TGOU in Nagaland after he was officially appointed as the Director, Indian Institute of Ecology and Environment, Nagaland extension, Wokha which is based in Paryavaran Complex, South of Saket in New Delhi as its main campus. He also opied that Naga youths will be suitabilly rewarded through gainful opportunities, thereby giving relief to the problem of educated unemoloyed youths and extended his gratitude to the sponsoring body President,  World Institution Building Programme, Dr. P. R. Trivedi, Rev. Dr. N. Ezung said the invocation prayer. The function was chaired by N. Mhao Lotha, Administrative Officer, TGOUN. A host of dignitaries including Dr. Deorani, Principal Secretary, Higher Education, Thepfulhovi Solo, Rtd. Principal CCF, Deputy Commissioner, Wokha Mikha Lomi, heads of offices, Lotha Hohi, Lotha Students' Union, public leaders and students attended the function followed by a grand feast. The whole arrangement of the said programme was initiated by the first Assistant Registrer of the Global Open University Nagaland, Oking, Wokha, Shri. M. Y. Lotha and his team.

The university has operated from its Headquarter, Wokha District. However, with the instication of some vested interested individuals convinced the President of the sponsoring body of TGOUN and theteby, neglected its Main Campus/Headquarter: Wokha at 'Tzukum Valley' since April 2012 till date (2017) and abandoned the demarkated land of the university which was submitted to the Hon'ble Governor to give his assent after proper and justified verification.

The university's Dimapur campus was inaugurated by the Chief Minister of Nagaland, [[Neiphiu Rio]], on (World Environment Day) 5 June 2007. Two other campuses have subsequently been launched at [[Kohima]] and Dimapur with permanent headquarter at Wokha as stated above. The Governor of Nagaland is the Chancellor/Visitor of the University. The Global Open University (TGOU), Nagaland is administered by a Governing Council and Executive Council.

== Joint venture ==
The Global Open University is a joint [[public-private partnership]] venture between the Government of Nagaland and the World Institution Building Programme (WIBP). The state government gives grants-in-aid to sponsor the students from Nagaland by paying their fee, and the WIBP as the sponsoring agency for the university provides Rs. 7 Crore as the Corpus Fund in the name of The Global Open University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugc.ac.in/inside/privateuniversities/globaluniversitynagaland.pdf|title=Report of the Inspection Committee on its visit to The Global Open University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hostile Waters''''', released as '''''Hostile Waters: Antaeus Rising''''' in America, is a hybrid vehicle and [[strategy game]] released on the PC in 2001 by the British company [[Rage Games Limited]]. It was inspired by an earlier game known as ''[[Carrier Command]]'' (Realtime Games, 1988). It has won several awards and one unofficial award from [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] as a "lost classic" or "The best game you’ve never played".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2007/12/07/making-of-hostile-waters/|title=Making Of: Hostile Waters|last=Gillen|first=Kieron|date=2007-12-07|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''Hostile Waters'' takes place in a Utopian future where war has been abolished. In the year 2012, a revolution takes place between the corrupt and power-hungry politicians, leaders and businessmen (described as the "Old Guard") and the people. The Old Guard were defeated, with only a few of their leaders escaping. By 2032, the world has been rebuilt as a [[utopia]], with the help of [[Nanotechnology|nano-technological]] assemblers, which are used in "creation engines" used to create matter from energy and waste, for free. The newly united world is governed from a capital city known as Central.

Missile attacks are suddenly launched against major cities all over the world from unknown locations. The location is eventually discovered to be an island chain in the [[South Pacific Ocean]]. A response to the missile attacks was a [[special forces]] team sent in to investigate the area for preliminary investigations. The Ministry of Intelligence (MinIntel) loses contact with it shortly thereafter. The [[world government]] authorises a reactivation of the ''Antaeus'' program, a series of warships able to create any weapon of their choosing using their on-board nano-technological creation engine. Two of these were left on the seabed in the case of an emergency, capable of being re-activated and refloating itself. On board are a series of "soulcatcher" chips, a classified 1990s military program researched into for the storage of human brain functions on a [[Integrated circuit|silicon chip]]. The soulcatcher technology was used to store the minds of every crew member ever assigned to an Antaeus vessel.

It is soon discovered that one of the [[cruiser]]s does not respond to the awakening signal. The other cruiser, however, is refloated and re-activated, with heavy damage to vital ship components. A course is plotted for a nearby, disused [[Floating_dock_(impounded)|wet-dock]].

As the ''Antaeus'' progresses from the wet-dock, unusual biological life-forms are discovered amongst the enemy bases on the islands. The identity of the aggressor firing the missiles is confirmed as the leftovers of the old, pre-Central forces, known as the Cabal. Outnumbering Central's army a thousand to one, they are fighting with thousands of troops and weapons that they hid away when it was apparent that the war was lost. The ''Antaeus'' is deployed into the chicane to stop the Cabal's operations there. It's later discovered that along with their superior numbers, they have also biologically engineered a species of organic machines, designed in the popular likeness of extraterrestrials, which they intend to use to create the fear of an alien invasion, to facilitate their taking over the world and the removal of the public use of creation engines.

The Cabal later lose control of the species, which eventually turn on their masters, destroying them, and start spreading, [[Terraforming|modifying]] the planetary climate and geographical features in an attempt to exterminate humanity and make the planet more hospitable to themselves. Having exterminated its creators, the species resolves to cleanse humanity as a whole from the planet using a massive [[grey goo|'disassembler cannon']], only to be stopped by the ''Antaeus''. The species subsequently attempts to flee into the cosmos and [[Space colonization|colonise]] the surrounding planets and stars, by launching a massive number of 'culture stones' (information devices that also double as creation engines) into space from an enormous, artificially-grown organic "island", their final staging point. Central's only option is to bind the ''Antaeus''{{'}} creation engine and the disassembler cannon stolen from the aliens together to create a makeshift bomb, and detonate it at the central "column" containing the culture stones. The plan succeeds, and the ''Antaeus'' is sacrificed to save the world.

The final cinematic show the organic disassembler cannon and the ''Antaeus''{{'}} creation engine moving closer together and fusing, creating something new. A post-credits scene also shows that two of the species' culture stones have managed to get into space.

==Gameplay==
Each Mission takes place on and or near a fortified enemy island containing various forms of anti-air and ground defence, with scattered unit-production complexes powered by oil-derricks and fuel containers (which are dependent on the oil-derricks) that the player can destroy to keep the enemy from replacing destroyed forces.

Vehicles are built on the Antaeus and, if desired, land vehicles can be delivered to a location by the air-lifting "magpie". Units are created by providing Antaeus with a number of resources which are obtained at the beginning of the level and debris which are taken from destroyed enemy units and structures. Transport helicopters such as the "Pegasus" can fly to an object and airlift it to the ship-board recycling system with little resources required. The carrier can analyse objects it disassembles at the rear of the Antaeus cruiser, and several of the game's vehicles and items are unlocked by "sampling" them in this fashion.

The game has a number of vehicles that are progressively unlocked as the missions progress. Vehicles contain a number of slots for equipment and a selection of different types of weapons to use the vehicle with. A variety of vehicle equipment combinations can be designed and used.

Vehicles have an individual damage multiplier such that different vehicles with the same weapon will do different damage. In addition to this, each soul-chip personality specializes in one unit along with specific equipment, which, if equipped will gain them a bonus in efficiency.

'''Intelligent Environments''' ('''IE''') are spaces with [[embedded systems]] and [[information and communication technologies]] creating interactive spaces that bring computation into the physical world and enhance occupants experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Augusto|first=Juan C|last2=Callaghan|first2=Vic|date=2013|title=Intelligent Environments: a manifesto|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2192-1962-3-12/fulltext.html|journal=Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences|publisher=Springer|volume=3|pages=12|doi=10.1186/2192-1962-3-12|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Intelligent environments are spaces in which computation is seamlessly used to enhance ordinary activity. One of the driving forces behind the emerging interest in highly interactive environments is to make computers not only genuine user-friendly but also essentially invisible to the user".&lt;ref&gt;Steventon, A., and Wright, S. (eds) (2006) ''Intelligent Spaces: The Application of Pervasive ICT'', Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

IEs describe physical environments in which information and communication technologies and sensor systems disappear as they become embedded into physical objects, infrastructures, and the surroundings in which we live, travel and work. The goal here is to allow computers to take part in activities never previously involved and allow people to interact with computers via gesture, voice, movement, and context.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intenv.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
[[File:Conceptual figure of Intelligent Space (J.-H. Lee and H. Hashimoto.png|thumb|365x365px|Conceptual figure of Intelligent Space (by J.-H. Lee and H. Hashimoto)]]
The idea of having an artificial intelligence capable of managing an environment, recollect data, and respond in consequence is older than we would expect. In the novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' from 1968, long before the [[Microcomputer revolution|microcomputers revolution]], you have the fictional character [[HAL 9000]], a computer capable of controlling the different sensors and systems of the environment and using them as extensions of itself. The character Proteus from the 1973 novel [[Demon Seed (novel)|Demon Seed]] also portrays the same characteristics of an artificial intelligence controlling an embedded environment. By the time these two novels were released, the idea of a computer controlling the environment that surrounds us was not broadly accepted by the community since both characters played the role of evil machines whose only objectives included the control over humans.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joo-Ho|last2=Hashimoto|first2=Hideki|date=2002|title=Intelligent Space — concept and contents|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1163/156855302760121936?needAccess=true&amp;|journal=Advanced Robotics|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=265–280|doi=10.1163/156855302760121936|issn=0169-1864|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not until 1991 with the introduction of [[ubiquitous computing]] by [[Mark Weiser]]  when we start seeing an inclination from the scientific community to study the area of computing outside of the typical machine with a keyboard and a screen. It became something that could be potentially implemented into anything that surrounds us, proposing casual access to computing to any user. In 1996 Hashimoto Laboratory at the [[University of Tokyo]] developed the first research on intelligent spaces. J.-H. Lee and H. Hashimoto designed a room with a homemade three-dimensional tracking sensor and mobile robots, all this connected to a network. The idea was for the robots to support the person in the room with different tasks with the help of vision cameras and computer sets, becoming one of the first intelligent environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At first, intelligent spaces were designed with the only objective to help people with physical tasks. Robots included in the room would help people to grab objects as well as support people with disabilities to do certain jobs. This idea started shifting into the concept we have today of intelligent environments, not only an environment to support people but also robots. The intelligent space became a platform that extends the censorial capacity of anything connected to it. If we start designing products, either software or hardware around this intelligent environments, the effort needed to complete all kinds of tasks would be drastically reduced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Challenges ==
Practical implementation of intelligent environments implies the solution of many challenges. [[Pervasive computing]] systems embedded in IE need to be proactive and to accomplish this, it is crucial that systems can track and determine the users' intent. The challenge here is finding that action that supposedly will help the user rather than hinder him. As of right now, algorithms behind the intelligent environments are constantly being reworked by the simple method of trial and error in artificial environments. It is not until a programmer can see an accurate enough level of prediction for the product to become commercialized. The degree of accuracy of intelligent environments depends on the task they want to accomplish. Some simple actions that do not substantially affect the user can admit more failures in the predictions than other functions that hold more responsibility. Still, there are always actions that cannot be fully predicted by the IE and needs some input from the user to be completed. One of the most significant challenges as of right now is determining which are those actions that are required for user input and how to create algorithms capable of eliminating that input so that the usability of the systems improves. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Satyanarayanan|first=M.|date=2001|title=Pervasive Computing: Vision and Challenges|url=|journal=IEEE Personal Communications|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the other hand, pro-activity of such environments has to be handled very carefully. Pervasive computing systems are supposed to be minimally intrusive and at the same time be capable of taking decisions that will help users. One way to achieve that is making those systems capable of modifying their behavior based on the user's state and surroundings. Here again, some challenges arise: What are the required data and information that a system needs to be context-aware? How frequently should that information be measured and consulted without hurting system performance? The goal is to create an IE capable of reacting fast and accurate to the needs and inputs of the user so it would be unnecessary for the sensors to record information that will not help the algorithms make the correct action to what is happening. Recognizing important data and filtering the environment to search for the appropriate place to obtain it results in a great challenge.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is crucial for pervasive computing systems to find the right level of pro-activity and transparency without annoying the user. Systems can infer the user's needs for pro-activity based on his level of expertise on a particular task. Self-tuning can be crucial for accomplishing this goal.

As the Intelligent Environments Conference (2007) points out: "Types of Intelligent Environments range from private to public and from fixed to mobile; some are ephemeral while others are permanent; some change type during their lifespan. The realization of Intelligent Environments requires the convergence of different disciplines: Information and Computer Science, Architecture, Material Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Sociology, and Design. Besides, technical breakthroughs are required in key enabling technology fields, such as microelectronics (e.g., miniaturization, power consumption), communication and networking technologies (e.g., broadband and wireless networks), [[Smart material|smart materials]] (e.g., bio-implants) and [[Intelligent agent|intelligent agents]] (e.g., context awareness)". The correct integration of all of these components is crucial to developing a useful IE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-ulm.de/ie07/ Intelligent Environments Conference (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Business ===
One of the main areas that will experience a significant impact on the emergence of IE is business relations. The way companies interact with each other and with people will suffer the most significant impact. Their relationships will become more dynamic and should emphasize a more flexible approach to businesses, trying to adapt to the continually changing commercial environment. Such flexibility should also be reflected also on their employees and their work environment. Even today, companies that have shown significant levels of flexibility on their working environments and with their employees (as at [[Microsoft]] or [[Google]]) have increasing levels of productivity and employees retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=WF3lFV6MQ_MC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR3&amp;dq=Intelligent+Spaces:+The+Application+of+Pervasive+ICT&amp;ots=CO9c7BJ8MR&amp;sig=z5A6j6nigUWNGxza1L4cg6NzK7s|title=Intelligent Spaces: The Application of Pervasive ICT|last=Steventon|first=Alan|last2=Wright|first2=Steve|date=2010-05-30|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781846284298|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critical issue that companies must take into account in the IE era is the way they approach the privacy of their clients. The success of these future companies will depend significantly on how people feel more confident in the use they give to their personal information. Another essential key to the success of these prospective businesses will be to allow the end user to have control over the way in which the IE systems make the decisions. Friendly user configurations should enable them to be in control of these systems but at the time is one of the biggest challenges for [[Systems engineering|systems engineers]].

=== Leisure Activities ===
New ways of entertainment have emerged since the creation of IE. There have been several experiments in museums where this technology is used to create a more interactive experience that makes the visitors not only experience history with their eyes but also feel in all of their senses. From the use of sounds and lights that adapt according to the expositions presented to the incorporation of smells that define unique environments, there are endless opportunities to the application of IE into this sort of entertainment.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=S|last2=Steventon|first2=A|title=Intelligent Spaces — The Vision, the Opportunities and the Barriers|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/B:BTTJ.0000047116.13540.e0.pdf|journal=BT Technology Journal|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|doi=10.1023/b:bttj.0000047116.13540.e0.pdf|issn=1358-3948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same concept can be used to not only improve existent leisure experiences but also to create new ones. Artistic expression has had a significant influence on this since we have seen new forms of art using [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]] and IE. Take for example the work of the artist [[Chris Milk]] where you can see the implementation of immersive installations that make the user not only appreciate a work of art but also be part of it. One of his most important work of arts, "The Treachery of Sanctuary" uses projections of the users' bodies in different screens to explore the creative process by using generated digital birds. These type of art requires the user's interaction to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://singularityhub.com/2017/02/06/art-in-the-age-of-ai-how-tech-is-redefining-our-creativity/#sm.0019lfhsf188sfq2rvh2a4wuls0p1|title=Art in the Age of AI: How Tech Is Redefining Our Creativity|date=2017-02-06|work=Singularity Hub|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Health Care ===
One of the most critical applications of Intelligent Environments is in the [[Healthcare industry|Healthcare Industry]]. You can use IE in the hospital's rooms to monitor the state of the patients without the patient even noticing, which results in less disturbance to those patients who need extraordinary amounts of rest and fewer efforts for nurses that are no longer required to check on patients regularly. This technology could substantially change the way in which hospitals and clinics are designed since nurses can be more efficient with their time attending patients in critical needs without leaving other patients under the care of intelligent rooms. This unique installations will no longer monitor the patient's health and notify the nurses, but it could also be programmed to interact with them with preventative purposes by administering specific drugs or directly delivering food when needed.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Caring of frail, elderly patients could dramatically change in the future with the use of IE. By introducing this technology into their own homes, we will be able to monitor a patient from anywhere we are without having the need to transporting them to hospitals or clinics to have proper care. This could transform nearly any house into an intelligent [[nursing home care]], allowing families to save lots of money by dramatically reducing the cost of care.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Emergency Response ===
Preventing is the best way to fighting a possible problem and there is no better way to do so that gathering information prior to a problematic event that helps us know when it would happen. IE would provide the perfect way to gather the data necessary to predict hazards and possible problems in the future. If we implement IE in our houses, it could notify, for example, the fire department if a fire is about to happen without us even noticing, or the police department if suspicious activity is detected in the proximity of our homes. In the best scenario, the event would not happen since the IE will help us create a diagnosis of the environment where it is implemented so that we could attack possible issues long before it happens. This will substantially improve live conditions in the cities, and a substantial economic impact since less hazardous events would happen, preventing material loss.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Environmental Monitoring ===
Intelligent Environments will help us monitor different natural environments at a much higher precision and granularity than the currently used techniques. By having access to a richer and more significant data, it will not only help us to control the environment for possible hazards, but it will also change the way in which we understand it, making us improve the current theories and models of environmental processes. As of today, this technology is being used to study phenomena such as coastal erosion, flooding and the movement of glacial. We know very little about the why of many natural processes that are currently affecting us and having more accurate and precise data will significantly improve the way in which we attack those issues so that we not only make humans more environmentally friendly but also improve the health of our planet.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

According to Shenzhen-Guangdong Industry Research [[Contemporary Amperex Technology|CATL]] is the largest producer of Lithum-ion batteries for electric mobility with a capacity of 12 GWh. Followed by [[Panasonic]] and [[BYD Auto|BYD]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2018-05-08/newcomer-surges-to-top-of-electric-vehicle-battery-market-101245701.html|title=Newcomer Surges to Top of Electric-Vehicle Battery Market_Caixin Global_财新网|website=www.caixinglobal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shenzhen Gaogong Industry Research, CATL last year churned out 11.8 GWh in battery capacity, a surge of over 74% from 2016. Japan’s Panasonic was second-largest with 10 GWh, and BYD came in third with 7.2 GWh. Another China-based maker, OptimumNano Energy Co. Ltd., and South Korea’s LG Chem were No. 4 and No. 5, producing 5.5 GWh and 4.5 GWh respectively.

The Lyapunov equation occurs in many branches of control theory, such as [[Lyapunov stability|stability analysis]] and [[optimal control]]. This and related equations are named after the Russian mathematician [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]].

==Application to stability==
In the following theorems &lt;math&gt;A, P, Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are symmetric. The notation &lt;math&gt;P&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; means that the matrix &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]].

'''Theorem''' (continuous time version).  Given any &lt;math&gt;Q&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique &lt;math&gt;P&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;A^T P + P A + Q = 0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the linear system &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=A x&lt;/math&gt; is globally asymptotically stable.  The quadratic function &lt;math&gt;V(x)=x^T P x&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Lyapunov function]] that can be used to verify stability.

'''Theorem''' (discrete time version).  Given any &lt;math&gt;Q&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique &lt;math&gt;P&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;A^T P A -P + Q = 0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the linear system &lt;math&gt;x(k+1)=A x(k)&lt;/math&gt; is globally asymptotically stable.  As before, &lt;math&gt;z^T P z&lt;/math&gt; is a Lyapunov function.

==Computational aspects of solution==

Specialized software is available for solving Lyapunov equations.  For the discrete case, the Schur method of Kitagawa is often used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kitagawa |first=G. |title=An Algorithm for Solving the Matrix Equation X = F X F' + S |journal=International Journal of Control |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=745–753 |year=1977 |doi=10.1080/00207177708922266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the continuous Lyapunov equation the method of Bartels and Stewart can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=R. H. |last=Bartels |first2=G. W. |last2=Stewart |title=Algorithm 432: Solution of the matrix equation AX + XB = C |journal=Comm. ACM |volume=15 |year=1972 |issue=9 |pages=820–826 |doi=10.1145/361573.361582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic solution==
Defining the &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{vec} (A)&lt;/math&gt; operator as stacking the columns of a matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A \otimes B&lt;/math&gt; as the [[Kronecker product]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, the continuous time and discrete time Lyapunov equations can be expressed as solutions of a matrix equation. Furthermore, if the matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is stable, the solution can also be expressed as an integral (continuous time case) or as an infinite sum (discrete time case).

===Discrete time===
Using the result that &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{vec}(ABC)=(C^{T} \otimes A)\operatorname{vec}(B) &lt;/math&gt;, one has
:&lt;math&gt; (I_{n^2}-\bar{A} \otimes A)\operatorname{vec}(X) = \operatorname{vec}(Q) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_{n^2}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[conformable]] identity matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J. |last=Hamilton |year=1994 |title=Time Series Analysis |at=Equations 10.2.13 and 10.2.18 |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-04289-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One may then solve for &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{vec}(X)&lt;/math&gt; by inverting or solving the linear equations.  To get &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, one must just reshape &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{vec} (X)&lt;/math&gt; appropriately.

Moreover, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is stable, the solution &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt; X = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} A^{k} Q (A^{H})^k &lt;/math&gt;.

For comparison, consider the one-dimensional case, where this just says that the solution of &lt;math&gt; (1 - a^2)\, x = q &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; x = \tfrac{q}{1-a^2} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} q\,a^{2k} &lt;/math&gt;.

===Continuous time===
Using again the Kronecker product notation and the vectorization operator, one has the matrix equation
:&lt;math&gt; (I_n \otimes A +  \bar{A} \otimes I_n) \operatorname{vec}X = -\operatorname{vec}Q, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\bar{A}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the matrix obtained by complex conjugating the entries of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

Similar to the discrete-time case, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is stable, the solution &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt; X = \int\limits_0^\infty \mathrm{e}^{A\, \tau} Q \mathrm{e}^{A^H\, \tau} d\tau  &lt;/math&gt;.

For comparison, consider the one-dimensional case, where this just says that the solution of &lt;math&gt; 2\, a\, x = - q &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; x = \tfrac{-q}{2\, a} = \int_0^{\infty} q\,\mathrm{e}^{2\, a\,\tau} d\tau &lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21261">'''Microbial biodegradation''' is the use of [[bioremediation]] and [[biotransformation]] methods to harness the naturally occurring ability of microbial [[xenobiotic metabolism]] to degrade, transform or accumulate environmental pollutants, including [[hydrocarbon]]s (e.g. oil), [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs), [[polyaromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), [[heterocyclic compounds]] (such as [[pyridine]] or [[quinoline]]), pharmaceutical substances, [[radionuclide]]s and metals.

Interest in the microbial biodegradation of [[pollutant]]s has intensified in recent years,&lt;ref name= KoukkouA-I&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Koukkou |editor1-first=Anna-Irini |year=2011 |title=Microbial Bioremediation of Non-metals: Current Research |publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] |isbn=978-1-904455-83-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Díaz |editor1-first=Eduardo |title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology |edition=1st |publisher=Caister Academic Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recent major methodological breakthroughs have enabled detailed genomic, metagenomic, proteomic, bioinformatic and other high-throughput analyses of environmentally relevant [[microorganism]]s, providing new insights into biodegradative pathways and the ability of organisms to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

Biological processes play a major role in the removal of [[contaminant]]s and take advantage of the catabolic versatility of microorganisms to degrade or convert such compounds.  In environmental [[microbiology]], [[genome]]-based global studies are increasing the understanding of metabolic and regulatory networks, as well as providing new information on the evolution of degradation pathways and molecular adaptation strategies to changing environmental conditions.

==Aerobic biodegradation of pollutants==
The increasing amount of bacterial genomic data provides new opportunities for understanding the genetic and molecular bases of the degradation of organic [[pollutant]]s. [[Aromatic compounds]] are among the most persistent of these pollutants and lessons can be learned from the recent genomic studies of ''[[Burkholderia xenovorans]]'' LB400 and ''[[Rhodococcus]]'' sp. strain RHA1, two of the largest bacterial genomes completely sequenced to date. These studies have helped expand our understanding of bacterial [[catabolism]], non-catabolic physiological adaptation to [[organic compound]]s, and the evolution of large bacterial [[genome]]s. First, the [[metabolic pathway]]s from phylogenetically diverse isolates are very similar with respect to overall organization. Thus, as originally noted in [[pseudomonadaceae|pseudomonads]], a large number of "peripheral aromatic" pathways funnel a range of natural and [[xenobiotic]] compounds into a restricted number of "central aromatic" pathways. Nevertheless, these pathways are genetically organized in genus-specific fashions, as exemplified by the b-ketoadipate and Paa pathways. Comparative genomic studies further reveal that some pathways are more widespread than initially thought. Thus, the Box and Paa pathways illustrate the prevalence of non-oxygenolytic ring-cleavage strategies in aerobic aromatic degradation processes. Functional genomic studies have been useful in establishing that even organisms harboring high numbers of [[homologous enzymes]] seem to contain few examples of true redundancy. For example, the multiplicity of ring-cleaving dioxygenases in certain rhodococcal isolates may be attributed to the cryptic aromatic catabolism of different terpenoids and steroids. Finally, analyses have indicated that recent genetic flux appears to have played a more significant role in the evolution of some large genomes, such as LB400's, than others. However, the emerging trend is that the large gene repertoires of potent pollutant degraders such as LB400 and RHA1 have evolved principally through more ancient processes. That this is true in such phylogenetically diverse species is remarkable and further suggests the ancient origin of this catabolic capacity.&lt;ref name=chapter1&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=McLeod MP, Eltis LD|lastauthoramp=yes | year=2008|chapter=Genomic Insights Into the Aerobic Pathways for Degradation of Organic Pollutants|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anaerobic biodegradation of pollutants==
[[Anaerobic organism|Anaerobic]] [[microbial]] mineralization of recalcitrant organic [[pollutant]]s is of great environmental significance and involves intriguing novel biochemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jugder|first=Bat-Erdene|last2=Ertan|first2=Haluk|last3=Lee|first3=Matthew|last4=Manefield|first4=Michael|last5=Marquis|first5=Christopher P.|date=2015|title=Reductive Dehalogenases Come of Age in Biological Destruction of Organohalides|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.07.004|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|volume=33|issue=10|pages=595–610|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.07.004|issn=0167-7799|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[hydrocarbon]]s and halogenated compounds have long been doubted to be degradable in the absence of oxygen, but the isolation of hitherto unknown anaerobic hydrocarbon-degrading and reductively dehalogenating [[bacteria]] during the last decades provided ultimate proof for these processes in nature. While such research involved mostly [[chlorinated]] compounds initially, recent studies have revealed reductive dehalogenation of [[bromine]] and [[iodine]] moieties in aromatic pesticides.&lt;ref name="Cupples, A. M. 2005"&gt;Cupples, A. M., R. A. Sanford, and G. K. Sims.  2005. Dehalogenation of Bromoxynil (3,5-Dibromo-4-Hydroxybenzonitrile) and Ioxynil (3,5-Diiodino-4-Hydroxybenzonitrile) by [[Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans]].  Appl. Env. Micro. 71(7):3741-3746.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other reactions, such as biologically induced [[abiotic]] reduction by soil minerals,&lt;ref&gt;Tor, J., C. Xu, J. M. Stucki, M. Wander, G. K. Sims. 2000. Trifluralin degradation under micro-biologically induced nitrate and Fe(III) reducing conditions.  Env. Sci. Tech. 34:3148-3152.&lt;/ref&gt; has been shown to deactivate relatively persistent aniline-based herbicides far more rapidly than observed in aerobic environments.  Many novel biochemical reactions were discovered enabling the respective metabolic pathways, but progress in the molecular understanding of these bacteria was rather slow, since genetic systems are not readily applicable for most of them. However, with the increasing application of [[genomics]] in the field of [[environmental microbiology]], a new and promising perspective is now at hand to obtain molecular insights into these new metabolic properties. Several complete genome sequences were determined during the last few years from bacteria capable of anaerobic organic pollutant degradation. The ~4.7 Mb [[genome]] of the facultative denitrifying ''[[Aromatoleum aromaticum]]'' strain EbN1 was the first to be determined for an anaerobic hydrocarbon degrader (using [[toluene]] or [[ethylbenzene]] as [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]s). The [[genome sequence]] revealed about two dozen [[gene cluster]]s (including several [[paralog]]s) coding for a complex catabolic network for anaerobic and aerobic degradation of aromatic compounds. The genome sequence forms the basis for current detailed studies on regulation of pathways and [[enzyme]] structures. Further genomes of anaerobic hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were recently completed for the iron-reducing species ''[[Geobacter metallireducens]]'' (accession nr. NC_007517) and the perchlorate-reducing ''[[Dechloromonas aromatica]]'' (accession nr. NC_007298), but these are not yet evaluated in formal publications. Complete genomes were also determined for bacteria capable of anaerobic degradation of halogenated hydrocarbons by [[halorespiration]]: the ~1.4 Mb genomes of ''[[Dehalococcoides ethenogenes]]'' strain 195 and ''[[Dehalococcoides]]'' sp. strain CBDB1 and the ~5.7 Mb genome of ''[[Desulfitobacterium hafniense]]'' strain Y51. Characteristic for all these bacteria is the presence of multiple paralogous genes for reductive dehalogenases, implicating a wider dehalogenating spectrum of the organisms than previously known. Moreover, genome sequences provided unprecedented insights into the evolution of reductive dehalogenation and differing strategies for niche adaptation.&lt;ref name=chapter2&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Heider J, Rabus R|lastauthoramp=yes |year=2008|chapter=Genomic Insights in the Anaerobic Biodegradation of Organic Pollutants|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, it has become apparent that some organisms, including ''Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans'', originally evaluated for halorespiration on chlorophenols, can also use certain brominated compounds, such as the herbicide [[bromoxynil]] and its major metabolite as electron acceptors for growth.  Iodinated compounds may be dehalogenated as well, though the process may not satisfy the need for an electron acceptor.&lt;ref name="Cupples, A. M. 2005"/&gt;

==Bioavailability, chemotaxis, and transport of pollutants==
[[Bioavailability]], or the amount of a substance that is physiochemically accessible to [[microorganism]]s is a key factor in the efficient [[biodegradation]] of pollutants.  O'Loughlin ''et al.'' (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Loughlin | first1 = E. J | last2 = Traina | first2 = S. J. | last3 = Sims | first3 = G. K. | year = 2000 | title = Effects of sorption on the biodegradation of 2-methylpyridine in aqueous suspensions of reference clay minerals | url = | journal = Environ. Toxicol. and Chem | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 2168–2174 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620190904}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that, with the exception of [[kaolinite]] clay, most soil clays and cation exchange resins attenuated biodegradation of [[2-picoline]] by ''[[Arthrobacter]]'' sp. strain R1, as a result of adsorption of the substrate to the clays.  [[Chemotaxis]], or the directed movement of motile organisms towards or away from chemicals in the environment is an important physiological response that may contribute to effective catabolism of molecules in the environment. In addition, mechanisms for the intracellular accumulation of aromatic molecules via various transport mechanisms are also important.&lt;ref name=chapter6&gt;{{cite book  |vauthors=Parales RE, etal |year=2008|chapter=Bioavailability, Chemotaxis, and Transport of Organic Pollutants|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil biodegradation==
[[File:Biodegradation of Pollutants.png|thumb|General overview of microbial biodegradation of petroleum oil by microbial communities. Some microorganisms, such as ''A. borkumensis'', are able to use hydrocarbons as their source for carbon in metabolism. They are able to oxidize the environmentally harmful hydrocarbons while producing harmless products, following the general equation C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In the figure, carbon is represented as yellow circles, oxygen as pink circles, and hydrogen as blue circles. This type of special metabolism allows these microbes to thrive in areas affected by oil spills and are important in the elimination of environmental pollutants.]]
[[Petroleum]] oil  contains aromatic compounds that are toxic to most life forms. Episodic and chronic [[pollution]] of the environment by oil causes major disruption to the local ecological environment. Marine environments in particular are especially vulnerable, as oil spills near coastal regions and in the open sea are difficult to contain and make mitigation efforts more complicated. In addition to pollution through human activities, approximately 250 million litres of petroleum enter the marine environment every year from natural seepages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its toxicity, a considerable fraction of petroleum oil entering marine systems is eliminated by the hydrocarbon-degrading activities of microbial communities, in particular by a recently discovered group of specialists, the hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (HCB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yakimov MM, Timmis KN, Golyshin PN |title=Obligate oil-degrading marine bacteria |journal=Curr.

K. and E.J. O'Loughlin.  1989. Degradation of pyridines in the environment.  CRC Critical Reviews in Environmental Control.  19(4): 309-340.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cholesterol biodegradation==
Many synthetic steroidic compounds like some sexual hormones frequently appear in municipal and industrial wastewaters, acting as environmental pollutants with strong metabolic activities negatively affecting the ecosystems. Since these compounds are common carbon sources for many different microorganisms their aerobic and anaerobic mineralization has been extensively studied. The interest of these studies lies on the biotechnological applications of sterol transforming enzymes for the industrial synthesis of sexual hormones and corticoids. Very recently, the catabolism of cholesterol has acquired a high relevance because it is involved in the infectivity of the pathogen ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' (''Mtb'').&lt;ref name="KoukkouA-I"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wipperman|first1=Matthew, F.|last2=Sampson|first2=Nicole, S.|last3=Thomas|first3=Suzanne, T.|title=Pathogen roid rage: Cholesterol utilization by Mycobacterium tuberculosis|journal=Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol|date=2014|doi=10.3109/10409238.2014.895700|pmid=24611808|volume=49|issue=4|pages=269–93|pmc=4255906}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mtb'' causes [[tuberculosis]] disease, and it has been demonstrated that novel enzyme architectures have evolved to bind and modify steroid compounds like cholesterol in this organism and other steroid-utilizing bacteria as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=S.T.|last2=Sampson|first2=N.S.|title=Mycobacterium tuberculosis utilizes a unique heterotetrameric structure for dehydrogenation of the cholesterol side chain|journal=Biochemistry|date=2013|volume=52|issue=17|pages=2895–2904|doi=10.1021/bi4002979|pmid=23560677|pmc=3726044}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wipperman|first1=M.F.|last2=Yang|first2=M.|last3=Thomas|first3=S.T.|last4=Sampson|first4=N.S.|title=Shrinking the FadE Proteome of ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'': Insights into Cholesterol Metabolism through Identification of an α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Heterotetrameric Acyl Coenzyme A Dehydrogenase Family|journal=J.

==Analysis of waste biotreatment==
Sustainable development requires the promotion of environmental management and a constant search for new technologies to treat vast quantities of wastes generated by increasing [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] activities. Biotreatment, the processing of wastes using living organisms, is an environmentally friendly, relatively simple and cost-effective alternative to physico-chemical clean-up options. Confined environments, such as [[bioreactors]], have been engineered to overcome the physical, chemical and biological limiting factors of biotreatment processes in highly controlled systems. The great versatility in the design of confined environments allows the treatment of a wide range of wastes under optimized conditions. To perform a correct assessment, it is necessary to consider various microorganisms having a variety of [[genome]]s and expressed transcripts and proteins. A great number of analyses are often required. Using traditional genomic techniques, such assessments are limited and time-consuming. However, several high-throughput techniques originally developed for medical studies can be applied to assess biotreatment in confined environments.&lt;ref name=chapter10&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Watanabe K, Kasai Y|lastauthoramp=yes |year=2008|chapter=Emerging Technologies to Analyze Natural Attenuation and Bioremediation|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metabolic engineering and biocatalytic applications==
The study of the fate of persistent organic chemicals in the environment has revealed a large reservoir of enzymatic reactions with a large potential in preparative organic synthesis, which has already been exploited for a number of [[oxygenase]]s on pilot and even on industrial scale. Novel catalysts can be obtained from [[metagenomic]] libraries and [[DNA sequence]] based approaches. Our increasing capabilities in adapting the catalysts to specific reactions and process requirements by rational and random [[mutagenesis]] broadens the scope for application in the fine chemical industry, but also in the field of [[biodegradation]]. In many cases, these catalysts need to be exploited in whole cell [[bioconversion]]s or in [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]s, calling for system-wide approaches to understanding strain physiology and metabolism and rational approaches to the engineering of whole cells as they are increasingly put forward in the area of systems [[biotechnology]] and synthetic biology.&lt;ref name=chapter12&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Meyer A, Panke S|lastauthoramp=yes |year=2008|chapter=Genomics in Metabolic Engineering and Biocatalytic Applications of the Pollutant Degradation Machinery|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fungal biodegradation==
In the ecosystem, different substrates are attacked at different rates by consortia of organisms from different kingdoms. ''[[Aspergillus]]'' and other [[mould]]s play an important role in these consortia because they are adept at recycling starches, hemicelluloses, celluloses, pectins and other sugar polymers. Some aspergilli are capable of degrading more refractory compounds such as fats, oils, chitin, and keratin. Maximum decomposition occurs when there is sufficient nitrogen, phosphorus and other essential inorganic nutrients. Fungi also provide food for many soil organisms.&lt;ref name="MachidaMGomiK"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Machida |editor1-first=Masayuki |editor2-last=Gomi |editor2-first=Katsuya |year=2010 |title=''Aspergillus'': Molecular Biology and Genomics |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-53-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Aspergillus'' the process of degradation is the means of obtaining nutrients. When these moulds degrade human-made substrates, the process usually is called biodeterioration. Both paper and textiles (cotton, jute, and linen) are particularly vulnerable to ''Aspergillus'' degradation. Our artistic heritage is also subject to ''Aspergillus'' assault. To give but one example, after Florence in Italy flooded in 1969, 74% of the isolates from a damaged Ghirlandaio fresco in the Ognissanti church were ''Aspergillus versicolor''.&lt;ref name="Bennettjw"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bennett JW |year=2010 |chapter=An Overview of the Genus ''Aspergillus'' |chapter-url=http://www.open-access-biology.com/aspergillus/aspergillusch1.pdf |title=''Aspergillus'': Molecular Biology and Genomics |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-53-0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617021430/http://www.open-access-biology.com/aspergillus/aspergillusch1.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microsoft Office PerformancePoint Server''' is a [[business intelligence]] [[Computer software|software]] product released in 2007 by [[Microsoft]].  The product was generally an integration of the acquisitions from [[ProClarity Corporation|ProClarity]] - the Planning Server and Monitoring Server - into Microsoft's SharePoint server product line.  Although discontinued in 2009, the dashboard, scorecard, and analytics capabilities of PerformancePoint Server were incorporated into [[Sharepoint 2010|SharePoint 2010]] and later versions.

PerformancePoint Server also provided a planning and budgeting component directly integrated with Excel.

==History==

Microsoft offered preview releases of PerformancePoint Server starting in mid-2006. Previews of the product were formed from Business Scorecard Manager 2005 and the Planning Server component. Acquisitions [[ProClarity Corporation|ProClarity]] and [[Great Plains Software|Great Plains]] brought additional analytics and planning/reporting capabilities, as well as companion products ProClarity 6.3 and [[Microsoft FRx|FRx]].

PerformancePoint Server was officially released in November 2007.

Microsoft discontinued PerformancePoint Server as an independent product in 2009 and folded its dashboard, scorecard and analytics capabilities into PerformancePoint Services in SharePoint Server 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/business_intelligence/analytics/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=212902915&amp;subSection=Business+Intelligence |title=Microsoft Makes Sweeping Changes To BI Software Strategy |date=January 27, 2009 |last=Weier |first=Mary Hayes |work=[[InformationWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monitoring Server Component==
Business monitoring capabilities, including dashboards, scorecards &amp; key performance indicators, navigable reports for deeper analysis, strategy maps, and linked filtering, are provided by PerformancePoint's Monitoring Server component. A Dashboard Designer application that is distributed from Monitoring Server enables business analysts or IT Administrators to:

* create &amp; test data source connections
* create views that use those data connections
* assemble the views into a dashboard
* deploy the dashboard as a [[SharePoint]] page

Dashboard Designer saved content and security information back to the Monitoring Server. Data source connections, such as OLAP cubes or relational tables, were also made through Monitoring Server.
 
After a dashboard has been published to the Monitoring Server database, it would be deployed as a SharePoint page and shared with other users as such. When the pages were opened in a web browser, Monitoring Server updated the data in the views by connecting back to the original data sources.

==Planning Server Component==
PerformancePoint's Planning Server component supported maintenance of logical business models, budget &amp; approval workflows, enterprise data sources, and it followed [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]].

Planning Server made use of Excel for input and line-of-business reporting, as well as SQL Server for storing and processing business models.

==Management Reporter Component==
The Management Reporter component was designed to perform financial reporting and can read PerformancePoint Planning models directly. A development kit was also available to allow this component to read other models .{{which|date=August 2013}}

The '''Musée de l'Imprimerie''' is a [[museum]] in [[Lyon]], France, with the mission of enhancing, conserving, documenting and valuing the heritage of printed books and graphic arts.

The museum was inaugurated in 1964. In 2006 the ''Grand Guide Michelin France'' awarded it two stars out of three&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Grand Guide Michelin France |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QV-rzYHDMMIC&amp;pg=PA19-IA64&amp;dq=%22Rue+du+B%C5%93uf%22+lyon&amp;lr=&amp;cd=144#v=onepage&amp;q=Mus%C3%A9e%20de%20l%27Imprimerie&amp;f=false |first1=Hélène |last1=Payelle |first2=Sylvie |last2=Chambadal |first3=Marylène |last3=Duteuil |first4=Juliette |last4=Deblanc |publisher=Lannoo |place=Tielt, Belgium |page=19 |year=2006 |language=French |accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007, the museum had 16,819 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fréquentation des musées en France en 2007 (par région et département) |url=http://www.veilleinfotourisme.fr/1222352874078/0/fiche___document/&amp;RH=1194271907394 |publisher=Veille Info Tourisme |language=French |page=149 |accessdate=27 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314184439/http://www.veilleinfotourisme.fr/1222352874078/0/fiche___document/%26RH%3D1194271907394 |archivedate=14 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:MuséeImprimerieLyon.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The courtyard of the museum]]
The Musee de l'Imprimerie was established in Lyon because Lyon had been a centre of printing and the book trade in Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries and the city held large historical collections of books and the graphic arts. The museum was designed by the master printer and historian [[Maurice Audin]], with the historian of the book, [[Henri-Jean Martin]], then chief curator of the Library of Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Musée de l'imprimerie de Lyon |url=http://ihl.enssib.fr/siteihl.php?page=19 |publisher=Institut d'Histoire du Livre |language=French |accessdate=27 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718090941/http://ihl.enssib.fr/siteihl.php?page=19 |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two banners before the entrance of the Hôtel de la Couronne, which hosted the meetings of the City of Lyon [[aldermen]] from 1604 to 1655&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Musée de l'Imprimerie |url=http://www.lyon.fr/vdl/sections/fr/arrondissements/2arrdt/culture/musees/musee_imprimerie_2 |publisher=Lyon |language=French |accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which is currently the headquarters of the Musée de l'Imprimerie, located at 13 [[rue de la Poulaillerie]]. In 1957 the building was given to the City of Lyon by the banking corporation, [[LCL S.A.]], and on 8 June 1963 the mayor of Lyon, [[Louis Pradel]],  inaugurated the Musée de la Banque on the occasion of the centenary of LCL.  Finally the current museum was opened in 1964.

Alan Marshall, a former printer, was its director until May 2015. He was replaced, in summer 2015, by Joseph Belletante, researcher in media history.

The museum has works by early printers of Lyon, including Martin Husz, [[Jodocus Badius|Josse Bade]], [[Sébastien Gryphe]], [[Etienne Dolet]], [[Jean de Tournes]], [[Guillaume Rouillé]] and Bernard Salomon. It shows the beginnings of Western printing from the fifteenth century - including examples of the work of [[Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim|Sweynheim and Pannartz]], [[Aldus Manutius]], [[Johann Froben]], the Estiennes and Christopher Plantin - to the twentieth century. It includes displays of the 20th-century inventions, [[Rene Alphonse Higonnet|Higonnet]] and [[Louis Moyroud|Moyroud]]'s Lumitype-Photon phototypesetter and the BBR system of computer typesetting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=L'imprimerie ou le patrimoine lyonnais |url=http://www.linternaute.com/musee/7092/musee-de-l-imprimerie-de-lyon/ |publisher=L'Internaute |language=French |accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Desaga''' was a German instrument maker at the [[University of Heidelberg]] who worked with [[Robert Wilhelm Bunsen]].  In 1855, Desaga perfected an earlier design of the laboratory burner by [[Michael Faraday]] into the [[Bunsen burner]]. The Desaga family held the right to market the burner for generations, as part of an agreement made with Bunsen. The Bunsen burner was essential to the invention of the [[spectroscope]] by Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and [[Gustav Robert Georg Kirchhoff]].

Peter Desaga's son, Carl Desaga, founded C. Desaga.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11351">[[File:Prüfeninger Weiheinschrift. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|250px|Prüfening dedicatory inscription. Its text was created by individual letter stamps.]]

The '''Prüfening dedicatory inscription''' ({{lang-de|Prüfeninger Weiheinschrift}}) is a [[High Middle Ages|high medieval]] inscription impressed on clay which was created in 1119, over three hundred years before [[Johannes Gutenberg]], by the [[typographic principle]].&lt;ref name="Brekle 2005, 25"/&gt; The inscription plate belongs to the [[Prüfening Abbey]], a former [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monastery, in [[Regensburg]], [[Germany]].

== Description ==
The [[Latin]] inscription is still at its original location in Prüfening Abbey, attached to one of the main pillars of its church. It reports the consecration act of the monastery in honour of [[Saint George|St. George]], carried out by the two bishops [[Otto of Bamberg]] and Hartwig of Regensburg. The inscription plate specifies the year of the act and, by implication, its own date as 1119 (•MCXVIIII•). It was made of baked [[clay]], painted over in an alternating, red white pattern, and is approximately 26&amp;nbsp;cm wide, 41&amp;nbsp;cm high and 3&amp;nbsp;cm thick, with a crack running through its entire breadth. The sunk [[letterform]]s are the classical ''capitalis monumentalis'' or [[Roman square capitals]]. Copies are at display in several German museums, including the [[Gutenberg Museum]] at Mainz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brekle|2005|pp=7−11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Typography ==
The unusual sharpness of the inscription letters has long led [[epigraphist]]s to believe that they were not carved by hand into the clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hupp|1906|pp=185f. (+ fig.)}}; {{harvnb|Lehmann-Haupt|1940|pp=96f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typographic character of the inscription was recently demonstrated in a systematic examination of the text body by the typesetter and linguist [[Herbert E. Brekle|Herbert Brekle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brekle|2005|}}; {{harvnb|Brekle|1997|pp=62f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His findings confirm that the text was produced with a [[printing]] method similar to that of the [[Phaistos Disc]]: The 17-line text was created by pressing individual, pre-formed stamps (probably made of wood) into the soft clay in a way that, for each letter which occurred more than once, the same letter stamp was re-used, thereby producing identical imprints throughout the text.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2005, 22–25"&gt;{{harvnb|Brekle|2005|pp=22–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the essential criterion for typographic text production was met, namely the repeated use of identical [[movable type|type]]s for a single character.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2005, 22–25"/&gt; In applying this technique, it is not relevant that the Prüfening inscription was made by stamping letters into the clay and not − as later practiced by Gutenberg − by printing on [[paper]], since neither the technical execution nor the print medium define [[movable type]] printing, but rather the criterion of [[Type–token distinction#Typography|type identity]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brekle|2005|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|The defining criterion which a typographic print has to fulfill is that of the type identity of the various letter forms which make up the printed text. In other words: each [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] form which appears in the text has to be shown as a particular instance ("[[Type–token distinction|token]]") of one and the same type which contains a reverse image of the printed letter.}}

By projecting the text letters one upon the other (e.g., all "A"s onto one another) at high magnification, the consistent type identity of the dedicatory inscription could be demonstrated beyond doubt.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2005, 22–25"/&gt; An additional indication that its creator had worked with reusable types is the marked tendency of some letters to tilt to the right or left; in those case the artisan apparently did not succeed in setting up the letter stamps completely parallel to the lateral borderline of the plate.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2005, 22–25"/&gt; The evidence of the skewed letters, but most importantly the observation that the type token criterion was met throughout the text prove the "typographic character of the Prüfening dedicatory inscription with certainty."&lt;ref name="Brekle 2005, 25"&gt;{{harvnb|Brekle|2005|p=25}}: {{quote|With these observations and concluding remarks, the typographic character of the Prüfening dedicatory inscription has been demonstrated with certainty. It has been shown that the typographic principle, that is the representation of letter "types" − in whatever physical manifestation − in each case of necessarily the same form (type identity) on a print medium in a string of lines, had been realized in Prüfening Abbey in 1119.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fragment of another inscription plate found close to the monastery indicates that the Prüfening abbey inscription did not remain an isolated phenomenon, but that at least locally the typographic production method was applied more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brekle|1995|pp=25f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further medieval techniques ===
In the cathedral of [[Cividale del Friuli|Cividale]], the silver [[altarpiece of Pellegrino II]], the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (episcopal)|patriarch of Aquileia]] between 1195 and 1204, was inscribed in Latin by the means of individual [[Punch (tool)#Letter|letter punches]] (instead of stamps).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lipinsky|1986|pp=78–80}}; {{harvnb|Koch|1994|p=213}}; {{harvnb|Brekle|2011|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from stamping and punching, another typographic method existed which followed the [[scrabble]] principle: for decorating the paved floors of monasteries and churches, [[Medieval letter tile|individual letter tiles]] were burnt and then so assembled that they formed [[Christian]] inscriptions on the floor. This technique seemed to be fairly widespread, with known examples ranging from England over the Netherlands to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehmann-Haupt|1940|pp=96f.}}; {{harvnb|Klamt|2004|pp=195–210}}; {{harvnb|Meijer|2004|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5268">In the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. military]], '''reactive materials''' ('''RM''') are a new class of materials currently being investigated by the [[Office of Naval Research]] and others as a means to increase the [[lethality]] of direct-hit or fragmentation [[warhead]]s. Reactive materials are similar to [[insensitive munitions#Insensitive high explosives|insensitive high explosives]], but are usually [[thermite]]-like [[pyrotechnic composition]]s of two or more nonexplosive solid materials, which stay inert and do not react with each other until subjected to a sufficiently strong mechanical, electrical or laser stimulus, after which they undergo fast burning or [[explosion]] with release of high amount of [[chemical energy]] in addition to their [[kinetic energy]]. Fragments or projectiles made of such materials have therefore greater damaging effect than inert ones, with expected lethality increase up to 500%.

The material classes under investigation are [[thermite]]s, [[intermetallic]] compounds, metal-polymer mixtures (e.g., [[magnesium/teflon/viton]]-like), [[metastable intermolecular composite]]s (MIC), matrix materials, and [[hydride]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Advanced Energetic Materials |author=Committee on Advanced Energetic Materials and Manufacturing Technologies, National Research Council |year=2004 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington D.C., USA |isbn=978-0-309-09160-2 |pages=20–23 |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10918&amp;page=20 |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These materials must be strong enough to act as structural components, be sufficiently stable to survive handling and launch, to penetrate a target, and sufficiently unstable to reliably ignite on impact.

The mixtures under investigation include one or more finely powdered (down to [[nanoparticle]] size) [[metalloid]]s or metals like [[aluminium]], [[magnesium]], [[zirconium]], [[titanium]], [[tungsten]], [[tantalum]], [[uranium]]&lt;ref&gt;Patents https://www.google.fr/patents/US7191709 and https://www.google.fr/patents/US7194961 make explicit reference to the use of uranium&lt;/ref&gt; or [[hafnium]], with one or more oxidizers like [[teflon]] or other [[fluoropolymer]], pressed or [[Sintering|sintered]] or bonded by other method to a compact, high-density mass. To achieve a suitable [[reaction rate]] and insensitivity to impact, friction, and [[electrostatic discharge]], fuel particles have sizes usually between 1-250&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=6593410 |status=patent |title=High Strength Reactive Materials |pubdate=2003-05-22 |gdate=2003-07-15  |fdate=2001-02-21 |pridate= |invent1=Nielson, Daniel B. |invent2=Tanner, Richard L. |invent3=Lund, Gary K. |assign1=Alliant Techsystems Inc. |class=C08K3/08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=6962634 |status=patent |title=Low temperature, extrudable, high density reactive materials |pubdate=2004-02-05 |gdate=2005-11-08 |fdate=2003-03-12 |invent1=Nielson, Daniel B. |invent2=Truitt, Richard M. |invent3=Rasmussen, Nikki |assign1=Alliant Techsystems Inc. |class=C06B27/00}}&lt;/ref&gt; A standard composition is aluminium-teflon (Al-PTFE).

Metals which can form [[intermetallic]] compounds by an [[exothermic]] reaction are another class of candidate materials. An example is a [[laminate]] of thin alternating layers of [[aluminum]] and [[nickel]], commercially available as [[NanoFoil]].

The RM weapons under development include an [[active protection system]] defensive grenade for intercepting incoming missiles or grenades and detonating them at a safe distance, and the [[BattleAxe (warhead)|BattleAxe]] warhead that covers a wide area with RM fragments with devastating results to [[soft target]]s, while the unexploded fragments left behind have very low lethality versus conventional [[cluster bomb]] remains.

Under research are materials with high [[mechanical strength]], high density, high [[energy density]], and which can rapidly convert from a consolidated structural material to fine powder with large surface area, be dispersed and then ignited to produce a large [[thermobaric weapon|thermobaric]] blast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/DSO/Programs/Reactive_Material_Structures_%28RMS%29.aspx |title=Reactive Material Structures (RMS) |work=Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[palladium]]-clad [[aluminum]] wire, known under trademark ''Pyrofuze'', is used as a [[pyrotechnic initiator]].

Reactive materials also have non-weapon uses. Thin layers of reactive materials, clad with a [[solder]], are used for [[reactive bonding]], e.g., in electronics, or for [[brazing]], such as in [[composite armor]] plates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32528">Western Electric's '''Reading Works''' in [[Berks County, Pennsylvania]] was a manufacturer of [[integrated circuit]] and [[optoelectronic]] equipment for communication and computing. The work force grew to nearly 5,000 by 1985 making the [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], facility one of Berks County's largest industrial employers. As a part of [[Western Electric]] and the [[Bell System]], it changed it masthead many times during its life.&lt;ref name="RE070617"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 6/17/07, ''Our industrious roots: Western Electric, This was Silicon Valley''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1952: From Allentown to Laureldale==
The origins can be traced back to 1876, when [[Elisha Gray]] lost his race to invent the telephone. [[Alexander Graham Bell]] put in a patent application just hours before Gray filed one. Gray nevertheless left his mark on the telephone industry in 1869 when he and Enos N. Barton formed Gray and Barton, a small manufacturing firm in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. Three years later, the firm, now based in [[Chicago]], was renamed the Western Electric Manufacturing Co. By 1880 it was the largest electrical manufacturing company in the US. A year later when growth of the telephone network was outstripping the capacity of smaller suppliers, [[Bell Telephone Company|American Bell]] purchased a controlling interest in [[Western Electric Company]] and made it the exclusive manufacturer of equipment for the Bell telephone companies. [[Western Electric Company]] was responsible for developing as well as manufacturing Bell equipment. In 1907, Theodore N. Vail combined the AT&amp;T and Western Electric engineering departments into a single organization that became [[Bell Labs]] in 1925. [[Western Electric]] became the manufacturing arm of the Bell System.

In 1951, just four years after the invention of the  [[transistor]] by [[Bell Laboratories]], the Allentown Plant was opened to manufacture the first transistors.&lt;ref name="MC181"&gt;Prescott C. Mabon (1975). '''''Mission Communications:''' The Story of Bell Laboratories''; Murray Hill (NJ), US; Bell Laboratories. Page 181&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RW3"&gt;Western Electric Co. (1983). ''Western Electric '''Reading Works:'''''; Reading (PA), US; Page 3&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Morton was assigned to develop transistors for manufacture. He had been responsible for inventing and providing the military with microwave components during WWII and knew how to get an idea from the lab, into production, and into the field. He established a system of branch labs at several Western Electric plants, consisting of teams of Bell Labs scientists and engineers focused on production engineering and acting as liaison with their colleagues back in Murray Hill. Morton fine-tuned this approach at the new Western Electric plant in Allentown, Pa., which produced electronic devices and components for the Bell System. He set up a Bell Labs semiconductor development group there and put Eugene Anderson in charge.&lt;ref name="IEEE1"&gt;Michael Riordan (2006). "''IEEE Spectrum, Volume 43, Issue 12,"" How Bell Labs Missed the Microchip"; IEEE Press, Piscataway (NJ), US; Page 36-41&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, operations in Reading began when [[Western Electric Company]] (WECO) converted the old Rosedale knitting mill in [[Laureldale]] into a factory that produced electronic components for the U.S. government for use by the military and the space program.&lt;ref name="RE981206"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 12/6/98, "Once a wee mill, Western Electric now dominant employer in Berks"; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 22, 1952, [[Western Electric Company]] opened the doors of its new electronics manufacturing facility in [[Laureldale]].&lt;ref name="RW3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RT141"&gt;Reading Eagle Company (1999).

New York: Norton. Page 204&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1952, there were 130 employees, and by the end of 1953, 253 employees.&lt;ref name="MC181"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RW3"/&gt;

On January 12, 1956, a diffused base transistor was unveiled at Laureldale before top military brass at a solid-state diffusion symposium. That was the same year that Bell Labs' scientists Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley received the 1956 Nobel Prize in physics for the invention of the transistor. "Bell Laboratories scientists in Murray Hill, N.J., may have won the Nobel Prizes and gotten most of the press, but Allentown and Reading delivered the goods," notes Stuart W. Leslie, a historian of science at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.&lt;ref name="IEEE2"&gt;Michael Riordan (2005). "''IEEE Spectrum, Volume 42, Issue 7,"" The End of "AT&amp;T"; IEEE Press, Piscataway (NJ), US; Page 46-51&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, a group of [[Bell Laboratories]] scientists moved to [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], from other locations and started the Laureldale Laboratory in the [[Laureldale]] [[Western Electric]] Plant. [[Bell Labs]] was a division of [[Western Electric]]. Initially the Laureldale Laboratory designed electron tubes ([[vacuum tubes]]). Eventually, after becoming the Reading Laboratory, it designed [[semiconductor devices]] which eventually included [[integrated circuits]], [[light emitting diodes]], and [[lasers]].&lt;ref name="MC181"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RW3"/&gt;

==1962: From Laureldale to Reading==
By the late 1950s, the increased demand for its products necessitated [[Western Electric]] building a larger facility, so plans were developed for a {{convert|200000|sqft|m2|-4|sing=on}} building at the North 11th Street site. The Greater Berks Development Fund built the Reading plant at the end of 11th street for $2 million to lease to [[Bell Labs]] and [[Western Electric]].&lt;ref name="RW3"/&gt;

Ground breaking took place in November 1960, and on January 2, 1962, [[Western Electric]] took possession of the new building, Building 30 (the manufacturing building).&lt;ref name="RW3"/&gt;

In 1964, [[Western Electric]] bought the {{convert|290000|sqft|m2|-3|sing=on}} building. By 1966 all facilities had moved from the [[Laureldale]] plant to the [[Muhlenberg Township, Pennsylvania]], site. The new facility was called the Reading Works and the branch of [[Bell Labs]] was called the Reading Labs.&lt;ref name="RW3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RE920216"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 2/16/92, ''AT&amp;T Reading Works plans on growth''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, when the Reading Works celebrated its 15th anniversary in [[Berks County]], it employed about 2,600 employees. Various additions since the mid-1960s increased the manufacturing space to {{convert|1300000|sqft|m2}}. Construction on the {{convert|210000|sqft|m2|-3|sing=on}} office building (Building 20) began in 1980, and the building was first occupied in 1982.&lt;ref name="RW3"/&gt;

==1984: Western Electric to AT&amp;T Technologies==
In 1984 the [[Bell System]] broke up into the various [[Baby Bell]] operating companies and [[AT&amp;T]]. As a result of this [[Bell System divestiture|divestiture]] in 1984, the Western Electric plant became an AT&amp;T Technology Systems ([[AT&amp;T Technologies|AT&amp;T Technology Systems]]) location as part of AT&amp;T, supplying devices for use in the former Bell System's network. By 1984, employment had reached what would be an all-time high of 4,900.&lt;ref name="RE061231"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 12/31/06, ''A time of CHANGE:''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, [[microchip]] and [[fiber-optic]] component manufacturing was combined into an AT&amp;T organization called [[AT&amp;T Microelectronics]]. In 1989 the AT&amp;T work force nationwide was 297,000 and while employment at the Reading Works was 3,200.&lt;ref name="RE891214"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 12/14/89, ''25 local jobs at risk in AT&amp;T restructuring''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 the Reading Works of AT&amp;T Microelectronics had 3,300 workers and provided an annual payroll of $100 million. The product mix included lightwave components, linear bipolar integrated circuits, high voltage integrated circuits, high speed silicon integrated circuits, and gallium arsenide integrated circuits.&lt;ref name="RE920216"/&gt; A satellite manufacturing building, Building 10, was constructed on North 13th Street, just north of the General Mail Facility, in 1992. The same year the Falconer building across the street was also used.&lt;ref name="RE920216"/&gt; AT&amp;T Reading Works was the No. 2 employer in Berks County in 1993,&lt;ref name="RE040104"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 1/04/04&lt;/ref&gt; but that was soon to end. In February 1994, AT&amp;T Reading Works announced that it would be cutting 850 jobs over a 3-year period.&lt;ref name="CJ10"&gt;Reading Eagle Company (2000). '''''A 20th Century Journey:''' 1990-1999''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. Page 10&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 the Reading Works' work force was reduced from 2,929 to 2,700 with most of the cuts in the Lightwave unit. The Lightwave unit makes fiber-optic laser transmitters and receivers.&lt;ref name="RE941109"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 11/09/94, ''Reading Works to lay off 84 workers''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the Reading Works' work force stood at 2,400 including AT&amp;T Microelectronics and Bell Labs as it prepared for the spin off from AT&amp;T into [[Lucent Technologies]].&lt;ref name="RE950921"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 9/21/95, ''Reading Works will be part of manufacturing company''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1996: AT&amp;T to Lucent==
Under the 1996 restructuring of [[AT&amp;T]], [[AT&amp;T Technologies]] became [[Lucent Technologies]]. The Lucent Technologies [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], facility became both a [[Lucent]] Microelectronics and a [[Lucent]] Optoelectronics facility, designing and manufacturing [[optoelectronic]] and [[integrated circuit]] components for applications in the [[telecommunications]] and [[computing]] industries.

The [[Lucent]] Reading Plant was unique in the [[semiconductor]] industry because it manufactured both [[optoelectronic]] and [[integrated circuit]] components. The facility received a $6 million renovation to boost its [[optoelectronics]] manufacturing capacity.

In addition to serving the traditional [[Telecommunication|communications]] markets, the Lucent [[Optoelectronics]] portion of the facility provided a family of transmitters and receivers for use in [[computer network|network computing]] applications. Lucent was also a leading player in the [[cable TV]] and [[hybrid fiber coaxial]] markets. In addition to [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], other Lucent [[Optoelectronics]] facilities were located in [[Breinigsville, Pennsylvania]]; [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]]; [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]], [[California]]; and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], [[Mexico]].

The [[Lucent]] [[Microelectronics]] portion of the facility produced linear bipolar, high voltage and gallium arsenide [[integrated circuits]]. These [[microchips]] were used in tone ringers, data processing, voltage regulators, video distribution, and in the industrial, computer, communication and instrumental markets. In addition to Reading, other [[Lucent]] Microelectronics integrated circuit sites included [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]; [[Orlando, Florida]]; [[Bangkok, Thailand]]; [[Tres Cantos, Spain]]; and [[Singapore]]. 

In 1996 the Reading Works' work force stood at 2,450 including AT&amp;T Microelectronics and [[Bell Labs]] as it made the transition from AT&amp;T into Lucent Technologies.&lt;ref name="RE960206"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 2/6/96, ''Reading Works to be Lucent Technologies''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The spin off of AT&amp;T manufacturing units as Lucent Technologies became necessary as these units increasingly found that their prospective customers were AT&amp;T competitors. The divestiture of the manufacturing units made them suppliers rather than competitors, opening up new markets to Lucent and to the Reading Works. At the same time it caused the anxiety that comes with change.&lt;ref name="RE960623"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 6/23/96, ''Lucent Technologies to focus on the future''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 1996, Lucent Technologies became independent of AT&amp;T. The Reading Works became Lucent Technologies Reading Facility. It employed 2,177 people, down considerably from 4,900 in 1985.&lt;ref name="RE961001"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 10/1/96, ''Lucent is cut loose by parent AT&amp;T''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Reading Eagle, 12/7/97, ''[[Reading Hospital]] again has largest local work force''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1997, the Reading Facility workforce had declined and remained stable at 2,000.&lt;ref name="RE971207"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 12/7/97, ''Reading Hospital again has largest local work force''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1998, the Reading Facility workforce had rebounded to 2,177.&lt;ref name="RE981206"/&gt; In 1999 a pickup in Lightwave business caused expansion of both the Reading Facility and the Breinigsville plant.&lt;ref name="RE990422"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 4/22/99, ''Lucent adding 100 jobs at Muhlenberg plant''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000: Lucent to Agere==

The Reading Plant's heritage, combined with constant innovation and product quality, positioned the Reading site as one of the largest [[semiconductor]] facilities in the world. In 2000, [[Lucent]] Microelectronics and Optoelectronics were reorganized as [[Agere Systems]] with the intention of spinning it off as an independent company. [[Agere Systems]] Inc. produced high-tech components such as [[opto-electronics]] products, which use light-wave technologies to transmit information, and [[integrated circuits]], which are miniaturized chips used in computers and communications. The [[opto-electronics]] parts were used in systems such as [[submarine communication cables]], cable transmitters, cable receivers, laser components, and network computing devices. The [[integrated circuits]] were found in a wide array of electronic products from modems and computers to cell phones and telephone offices to video equipment and digital television. After becoming Agere Systems, by the end of 2000, the Reading Facility became the Muhlenberg plant and had grown its workforce by 800 to 3,000 as the anticipated lightwave business materialized.&lt;ref name="RE001217"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 12/17/00, ''Berks County's top 20 employers''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[Agere Systems]]'s stock went public in late March. The spin-off was completed on June 1, 2002. By mid-2001, Agere cut 508 jobs at the Reading Works.&lt;ref name="RE010509"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 5/9/01, ''Agere boosts job cuts in Berks''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These layoffs continued in waves as conditions in the semiconductor market deteriorated and by the end of the year only had a workforce of 1,546.&lt;ref name="RE011216"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 12/16/01, ''Berks County's top employers''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2003: From Agere to Closure==

On January 24, 2002, [[Agere Systems]] announced that it would be closing the {{convert|1300000|sqft|m2}} Reading Works in 12 to 18 months. The planned changes involved closing the [[Breinigsville, Pennsylvania]] plant in [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania]], which was opened in 1988;&lt;ref name="RE041208"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 12/8/04, ''TriQuint cutting jobs in Lehigh''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; selling the Orlando plant in Florida; and consolidating several locations in New Jersey. All operations were consolidated at the [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], headquarters location and the New Jersey locations. About 1,500 workers were transferred from Reading to Allentown where 3,200 workers were employed prior to the relocation. As Agere was leaving, Legerity, Inc., assumed some of the operations formerly done by the Muhlenberg plant in the old Building 10 on North 13th Street. In this facility Legerity assembled 40 former Agere circuit-design, physical-design, application-design and process development engineers to support the analog line card integrated circuit business it purchased from Agere. Legerity is a design facility that uses other companies foundries to manufacture its products.&lt;ref name="RE030223"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 2/23/03, ''New Berks chip operation has a familiar ring''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2003, Agere Systems Inc. ended all manufacturing and began decommissioning its Muhlenberg Township plant. The last 346 manufacturing employees were laid off. About 50 employees — mostly maintenance — remained at the plant until a buyer was found.&lt;ref name="RE030522"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 5/55/03, ''Agere shuts down Muhlenberg plant''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agere built a $165 million World Headquarters building in [[Hanover Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania]]. This building was started in 2001 and completed in 2003. It brought together research and development facilities from Breinigsville and Muhlenberg Township. It absorbed about 2,000 workers from these two facilities.&lt;ref name="RE020407"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 4/7/02, ''Agere Moves Up; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agere Systems]] tried unsuccessfully to sell its Union Boulevard plant in Allentown, where the first commercial production line for transistors was set up in 1951. [[Agere Systems]] demolished the manufacturing part of the Union Boulevard facility. The company continues to use the offices and wet labs in the remaining part of the building. Its headquarters building is nearby in [[Hanover Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Hanover Township, Pennsylvania]]. In 2003, [[Agere Systems]] sold the chip plant and research center in Breinigsville to TriQuint Semiconductor, which also bought the company's [[fiber-optic]] components division. The facility, now under different ownership, is a multi-tenant technology park.&lt;ref name="RE061231"/&gt;

At the end of 1999 shares of Lucent stock hit a high of nearly $80. After spinning off [[Agere Systems]], Lucent shares dropped to around $4.50 and later dropped to $0.55 in October 2002. After being spun off, Agere shares were about $4 and dropped to a low of $0.50 in October 2002. Agere started 2000 with 18,000 employees. By the end of the year it had only 10,000 employees. By the end of 2001 the number of employees had dropped to about 7,000. The last wafer starts at the Reading Works were scheduled for April, 2003 and the last shipments were scheduled for May, 2003. The doors locked on May 16, 2003. Starting May 17, the Reading work force consisted of 100 employees who cleaned up the facility and disposed of equipment. In July the work force was down to 50 maintenance employees who manned the {{convert|1300000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility while an attempts were made to sell it or at least rent or lease it. On December 13, 2005, it was announced that Agere had signed a sales agreement with a [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania]], developer to sell the {{convert|133|acre|km2|1|sing=on}} Agere Systems Inc. property in [[Muhlenberg Township, Pennsylvania]], and projects the return of 1,000 jobs to the site within 18 months, with more jobs to follow.

==2005: From the USA==
The last USA based [[Agere Systems]] manufacturing plant in [[Orlando, Florida]], which once employed 1,800, was closed on September 30, 2005, after 20 years of [[semiconductors]] manufacture&lt;ref name="OS051001"&gt;The Orlando Sentinel 1/10/05, Orlando (FL), US&lt;/ref&gt; and sold in 2007. The company has plants in [[Singapore]] and [[Thailand]], and operated 22 sales offices and 16 research and development facilities throughout the world. Its key centers are in Ascot, U.K.; [[Bangalore, India]]; [[San Jose, CA]], U.S.; [[Shanghai, China]]; and [[Singapore]] as well as the world headquarters in [[Lehigh Valley]], PA.

[[Agere Systems]] still maintained its position as a key chip supplier for [[cell phones]] and [[hard disk]] drives. However, the chips it supplied were purchased from outside chip foundries or made offshore rather than made locally. In 2003, 3,000 of the best jobs in town disappeared when [[Agere Systems]] closed the Reading Works. But the jobs won't come back when the economy does; like many other high-tech companies, [[Agere Systems]] moved production overseas.

[[Outsourcing]] is a new name for a long-standing phenomenon: the movement of jobs from the USA to countries where wages, benefits and the cost of living are much lower. In the 1970s and 1980s, heavy manufacturing jobs went to other countries by the tens of thousands. The result was cheaper goods for U.S. consumers and less pollution in many of the nation's industrial cities. Economists who backed the trend envisioned a new "knowledge economy" in which well-trained Americans would become the world's designers, innovators and administrators. The dirty work would be sent overseas.

Not to take advantage of those countries' pools of highly educated, relatively low-wage workers would be foolish, [[Agere Systems]] officials said. "Our customers are very demanding," says John Harris, an engineer and marketing manager at Agere's [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], headquarters. "They're under intense pressure to deliver extremely high quality at extremely low cost. That pressure comes right back on us."

On December 4, 2006, Agere's President and CEO, Rick Clemmer, announced that it would be bought by [[LSI Logic]] Corporation of [[Milpitas, California]] in an all-stock transaction. On March 29, 2007, this merger was approved by shareholders of both companies, making it official.&lt;ref name="MC070330"&gt;The Morning Call 3/30/07, Allentown (PA), US&lt;/ref&gt; The companies together own a patent portfolio consisting of more than 10,000 issued and pending U.S. patents.&lt;ref name="RE061205"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 12/5/06, ''California firm buying Agere''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Spun off by [[Lucent Technologies]] in 2001, [[Agere Systems]] was the creation of a corporate behemoth, while LSI was born 25 years ago as a tiny startup. [[LSI Logic]] already has decided to dump the Agere name, which once symbolized the Lehigh Valley's aspirations to become a technology hub. Compared to [[Agere Systems]], [[LSI Logic]] has run a tight ship. It generates roughly 20 percent more revenue — $2 billion — with fewer employees worldwide: 3,900, compared to Agere's 5,300. [[LSI Logic]] will use the [[Agere Systems]] facilities as the center of its research operations, but the combined company's headquarters will be in [[Milpitas, California]].&lt;ref name="RE061231"/&gt;

[[LSI Logic]] has come a long way since 1981, when [[Wilfred Corrigan]] founded the company with $6 million of venture capital. Corrigan, a native of [[Liverpool, England]], moved to the United States to pursue a career in electronics. He climbed the ladder at [[Motorola]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], before becoming CEO of [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] in [[Mountain View, California]], in the mid-1970s. The launch of [[LSI Logic]] marked his transition to entrepreneur. The company went public in 1983. By the mid-1990s, [[LSI Logic]] was selling chips to [[Sony]] for its PlayStation video game machine. And in 2001, it made its first major acquisition, C-Cube Microsystems, in a stock deal valued at $851 million.&lt;ref name="RE061231"/&gt;

In recent times, [[LSI Logic]] has followed a strategy similar to [[Agere Systems]]. This year, the company sold an Oregon semiconductor manufacturing facility and acquired two smaller companies, in Israel and India. Now it's swallowing up [[Agere Systems]], which is nearly its equal, in terms of revenue but not productivity. Hence ends the saga of the [[semiconductor]] plant that was built in Reading in 1952.&lt;ref name="RE061231"/&gt;

==2006: Greater Reading Expo Center==
Audubon Land Development of Oaks, [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania]], bought the old Reading Works in December 2005 for an undisclosed amount. [[Agere Systems]] spokesman Glen Haley confirmed the deal. [[Agere Systems]] had been asking for $8 million for the property, but Haley and Call declined to disclose the purchase price. The assessment of the property was lowered to $9.5 million from $26.3 million after [[Agere Systems]] appealed. On Tuesday, March 14, 2006, Urban Expositions, a Georgia-based trade show company, announced it would hold the 10th annual Philadelphia Gift Show at the Reading center July 23–26, 2006. The facility is being called the Greater Reading Expo Center. A company press release calls the event, with an expected 1,400 booths, the largest regional gift show in the country. Gene Call, an Audubon spokesman, said Audubon's subsidiary, Stonepoint Management Corp., which is leasing the {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2|-3|sing=on}} [[Agere Systems]] building, would run the exposition center. Stonepoint would use {{convert|350000|sqft|m2|-3}}, he said. Stonepoint is exploring other uses but has not made firm plans, he said.&lt;ref name="RE061231"/&gt;

Crystal Seitz, president of the Greater Reading Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, said a typical convention center with a steady stream of shows generates about $150 million for a local economy, including money spent for lodging and meals. Jon C. Scott, president of the Berks Economic Partnership, said he has met several times with Audubon officials and is excited about the prospects for the center. “It opens up the type of exhibits that would never have been available before,” Scott said. “It leads to other intriguing possibilities.” Some of the shows scheduled for the facility included: Philadelphia Gift Show which includes Birdwatch America-Philadelphia, Great Train Expo, Bead Fest Philadelphia, Greater Philadelphia Pet Expo, Great American Guitar Show, Sports Card &amp; Memorabilia Show,&lt;ref name="RE070301"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 3/01/07, ''Sports memorabilia show at expo center''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Home &amp; Garden Show,&lt;ref name="RE070308"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 3/8/07, ''Making value judgments''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and The Greater Reading Sport, Travel &amp; Outdoors Show.&lt;ref name="RE061231"/&gt;

Success of the Expo Center is in part due to the closing of the Fort Washington Exposition Center in Montgomery County and the Pennsylvania Expo Center in Lehigh County and in part due to the {{convert|250000|sqft|m2|-3}} of inside space, several auditoriums, numerous meeting rooms, 13 loading docks, ample parking and a full-service cafeteria among its amenities, the expo center.&lt;ref name="RE061029"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 10/29/06, ''Two closed expo centers give renovated local site a big boost.''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhlenberg Township waived the 10% amusement tax on admission to the expo center from January through September 2007. This was an attempt to allow the Expo Center to become better established. The township estimates future revenues at $50,000 per year.&lt;ref name="RE061219"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 12/19/06, ''Expo center granted break on taxes''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development included the StonePointe Center, the former Agere complex in Muhlenberg Township, which includes the Greater Reading Expo Center, as part of the Greater Reading Keystone Innovation Zone and invested $235,000 to fund its operations. Also included in this zone is TEK Park, the former home of Lucent/Agere Optoelectronics in Breinigsville, Lehigh County, which houses a number of industrial tenants and the Kutztown University Innovation Center.&lt;ref name="RE061115"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 11/15/06, ''State creates local job-growth area''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Building 30 is now called the "Flex Building" and building 20 is the "Office Building". They are keeping their options open. Here is what they say: "Imagine a state of the art business center, with more than one million square feet of available space for office, manufacturing and distribution; a facility with high-tech infrastructure and easy access to transportation. Imagine a convenient location near [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], with professional on-site management to support your business. Imagine your business at StonePointe Center." &lt;ref name="RE061231"/&gt;
The Expo Center is the latest in venues that mark a renaissance in Reading. It started with the opening of the Sovereign Center and its sister the Sovereign Performing Arts Center. Now it includes the Goggle-Works Center for the Arts, and the Greater Reading Expo Center.&lt;ref name="RE060924"&gt;The Reading Eagle, 9/24/06, ''Sovereign Center, Sovereign Performing Arts Center spark area renaissance''; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Lindsay Galloway''' (22 February 1844 – 24 February 1908) was a Scottish mining engineer and author, the son of William Galloway (1799–1854), a [[Paisley shawl]] manufacturer and coal master and Margaret Lindsay (1818–1902) daughter of Thomas Lindsay, a [[Glasgow]] [[brewer]]. He was born in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], Scotland

== Family ==
Galloway was the younger brother of [[Sir William Galloway]], mining engineer and professor of mining at the [[University College of Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. He married Elizabeth Baird, daughter of James Baird, farmer from Sorn in [[Ayrshire]] on 14 November 1871. They had two sons, William Galloway born 1872 in Newcastle and James Baird Galloway born in 1874 at [[Gateshead]]. His wife and younger son died in 1875 and his son William was brought up by his maternal grandparents in Sorn, and became a farmer before moving to [[Essex]].

His half-brother John Galloway who lived in Ayrshire, and younger brothers, [[T. Lindsay Galloway]] and James Jack Galloway of Glasgow, were also coal masters. John's son James William Galloway, coalmaster in Ayrshire, and Sir William's son [[Christian Francis John Galloway]], a mining engineer and author in Cardiff were the only members of the next generation to continue in the industry.

Robert Galloway died in Scotland on 24 February 1908 at [[Bridge of Allan]], in [[Stirlingshire]].

== Mining career ==

When Galloway was 27 he was a mining engineer and coal master employing five men in 1871 at Sorn in Ayrshire. After he married he moved to [[County Durham]] and qualified as a certificated colliery manager and became a member of the [[North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers]] at [[Ryton, Tyne and Wear|Ryton on Tyne]] on 6 December 1873.&lt;ref name="dmm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmm.org.uk/certs/names_ga.htm|title=Durham Mining Museum - Management Certificates &amp;#91;ga*&amp;#93;|author=Durham Mining Museum|publisher=dmm.org.uk|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While he was a [[mining engineer]] and colliery manager in the [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] area and in Scotland, he became known as a historian specialising in writing about the mining industry and the [[steam engine]].&lt;ref name="Barnet1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard J.

== Literary career ==

On 30 April 1879 Galloway presented 'Earliest records connected with the working of coal on the banks of the River Tyne' to a meeting of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Earliest Records Connected with the Working of Coal on the Banks of the River Tyne: Read at the Meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastole-upon-Tyne, 30th April, 1879|author1=Galloway, R.L.|author2=Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne|date=1879|publisher=Andrew Reid|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cwbEQAAACAAJ|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880 his book 'The Steam Engine and its Inventors' was published.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Steam Engine and Its Inventors - A Historical Sketch|author=Galloway, R.L.|date=2010|publisher=Read Books Design|isbn=9781446023471|url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL6738975W/The_Steam_Engine_and_Its_Inventors_A_Historical_Sketch|accessdate=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later his 'A History of Coal Mining in Great Britain' was printed.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Coal Mining in Great Britain|author=Galloway, R.L.|date=2010|publisher=Read Books Design|isbn=9781445551982|url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL254258W/A_history_of_coal_mining_in_Great_Britain|accessdate=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Galloway helped organize a mining exhibition between 1–24 September 1885 at Burnbank Drill Halls, [[Glasgow]] and he wrote a 'Review of the Progressive Improvements of Mining in Scotland' as an introduction to the exhibition catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to 1970 edition of 'Annals of Coal Mining and the Coal Trade' Vol. I [https://books.google.com/books?id=GFsZ_gAACAAJ&amp;dq=robert+lindsay+galloway&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QzPGTsTEDIau8QOOxZSSAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mining exhibition: under the auspices of the Mining Institute of Scotland, held at Burnbank drill halls, Great western road, Glasgow, 1st till 24th September, 1885.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3320">'''Saros'''&lt;ref name="saros-project"&gt;Saros homepage at http://www.saros-project.org&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] for [[Collaborative real-time editor|distributed collaborative text editing]] that can support five&lt;ref name=saros-project /&gt;  participants at once (typically two or three). It can be used for a variety of purposes ranging from simple remote code review, over [[Remote pair programming]], through to variants of [[Side-by-side programming]] with more than two participants.

==Functionality==
All members of a session have an identical copy of Eclipse projects and Saros keeps these copies in sync as editing progresses. 
At the beginning of a session, Saros will automatically synchronize the contents of the Eclipse project from the initiator of a session ("host") to the other participants.

During the session, markers in every participant's viewport will indicate who is currently seeing what and who made recent changes where ("awareness information"). 
Explicit [[Syntax highlighting|highlighting]] of text for others is done by means of simple text selection which will be shown in a color that indicates who performed the selection.

Separate [[audio conferencing]] (such as [[Skype]]) completes the collaboration scenario. Basic whiteboard sketching functionality is built in.

==Underlying technology==
With multiple concurrent writers, write conflicts can occur. Saros will resolve them consistently by means of the [[Operational_transformation#OT_control_.28integration.29_algorithms|Jupiter algorithm]] (an architecture for [[operational transformation]]).

Saros uses an [[XMPP]]/Jabber server for [[session (computer science)|session]] initiation. It will also use XMPP for subsequent communication if and insofar as some participants cannot be reached directly via [[Internet Protocol|IP]] (typically because their computer is behind a [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] or [[Network address translation|NAT]]). 
However, Saros uses [[Socks5]] to provide low-[[latency (engineering)|latency]], high-bandwidth connections whenever possible and is able to apply [[Universal Plug and Play|UPnP]] for traversing the NATs of typical home networks.

==User Experience==

Compared to cooperation via screensharing, working with Saros has a number of 
advantages:&lt;ref name="sarosuser-tim"&gt;[https://devblog.timgroup.com/2014/03/12/distributed-pair-programming-tim-group-with-saros/ Distributed Pair Programming @ TIM Group with Saros]&lt;/ref&gt;
* No latency until typed characters appear for either partner
* Working with one's own IDE configuration
* Concurrent work possible if needed
The latter (if used wisely) can be advantageous even in comparison to local pair programming.

==License==
Saros is an [[Open-source software|open source]] project under [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]. It is hosted at [[SourceForge]].&lt;ref name="dpp-sourceforge"&gt;Saros project site at http://www.sf.net/projects/dpp&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Self checkout using NCR Fastlane machines.jpg|thumb|[[NCR Corporation]] model of self-service checkouts and fast-lane at a [[Sainsbury's]] store]]

'''Self-checkout''' (also known as '''self-service checkout''' and as '''semi-attended customer-activated terminal''', '''SACAT''') machines provide a mechanism for customers to process their own purchases from a [[retail]]er. They are an alternative to the traditional [[cashier]]-staffed [[point of sale|checkout]]. The customer performs the job of the cashier themselves, by scanning and applying payment{{clarifyme|date=June 2017}} for the items.

As of 2013, there were 191,000 self-checkout units worldwide, and the number was estimated to reach 325,000 units by 2019.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncr.com/sites/default/files/white_papers/RET_SCO_wp.pdf|title=SELF-CHECKOUT: A GLOBAL CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NCR Whitepaper|access-date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The machines were invented by David R. Humble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://losspreventionmedia.com/insider/retail-industry/self-checkout-reaches-critical-mass/|title=Self-Checkout Reaches Critical Mass - LPM|website=losspreventionmedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US4676343|title=Self-service distribution system|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In self-checkout systems, the [[customer]] is required to:
* scan the [[barcode]]s;
* input the types of items such as fruit and vegetable (usually with a [[touchscreen]] display);
* weigh them, if applicable;
* and place all scanned items into a "bagging area". The weight observed in the bagging area is verified against previously stored information to ensure that the correct item is bagged, allowing the customer to proceed only if the observed and expected weights match.&lt;ref name="age2008"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/a-new-way-to-shop-151-check-it-out-for-yourself/2008/04/21/1208742852723.html?page=fullpage|title=A new way to shop&amp;nbsp;— check it out for yourself|accessdate=2 September 2008|author=Daniella Miletic|date=22 April 2008|publisher=The Age|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Payment by various methods may be accepted by the machines: card via [[EFTPOS]], [[debit card|debit]]/[[credit card]]s, electronic [[Ration stamp|food assistance]] cards, [[cash]] via [[coin]] slot and [[bill validator|bank note scanner]], and in-store gift cards where applicable. Most [[coupons]] also have barcodes and can be scanned the same way that items are scanned, although some require entry by a member of staff.

== Advantages ==
The benefit to the retailer in providing self-checkout machines is in reduced labour costs: one attendant can often run four to six checkout lanes with the work of the cashier now being assumed by the customer. The size of a self-checkout machine is also smaller than a traditional checkout manned by a cashier; thus, a store can save space, which could be used for more shelves, display cabinets or additional checkouts.

Customers who do not want to interact with the cashier can use the self-checkout.

Self-checkout can also sometimes be faster than using a cashier lane. This can reduce the length of checkout lines (British: queues) and wait times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessbee.com/resources/profitability/the-pros-and-cons-of-using-self-checkouts/|title=The Pros and Cons of Using Self-Checkouts - BusinessBee|date=7 August 2013|website=BusinessBee|language=en-US|access-date=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey by NCR, 42% of customers said they liked the convenience of self-checkout, while 39% said it was faster than the cashier-assisted line. 90% of those surveyed responded as being users of self-checkout, with 7% of respondents saying they will always use self-checkout regardless of store lines and number of items. Survey respondents in Italy and Australia said they "always use self-checkout" at a rate of 13% and 9% respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One advantage is that self-checkouts can, if the necessary investment is made, provide a partly multilingual service. (It cannot be fully bilingual unless the goods are labelled in all the relevant languages, which is often not the case.) For example, [[Tesco]]'s Welsh stores which can serve customers in [[Welsh language|Welsh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/tesco-looking-into-bilingual-self-service-checkouts-1378599-Mar2014/|title=Tesco is looking at introducing Irish-speaking self-service checkouts|last=Hosford|first=Paul|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas finding enough fluent Welsh-speakers as staff can be difficult because in some areas only a small proportion of local people have Welsh as their first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/evan-harris/home-truths-decline-of-welsh-language|title=Home Truths: the decline of the Welsh language|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Disadvantages ==

=== Shoplifting ===
[[File:US Army 51805 Post, AAFES combat increases in juvenile shoplifting.jpg|thumb|Stores may monitor shoplifters using [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]]]]
Self-checkout is vulnerable to some [[shoplifting]] techniques. In some cases the machine will pick up the attempt to steal, or cause the shopper to alter their behavior (e.g. an item can be put not on the scales but somewhere else where it should not be put, and this may be noticed by the system supervisor). For example, in 2007, a man was charged with replacing the tag of a plasma TV with a $4.88 DVD, and trying to purchase it through self-checkout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meg|first=Maco|title=Guy Switches Price Tag On Walmart Plasma TV, Tries To Buy It For KES423|url=http://consumerist.com/2007/06/29/guy-switches-price-tag-on-walmart-plasma-tv-tries-to-buy-it-for-488/|work=tips@consumerist.com|publisher=Consumerist|accessdate=3 April 2014|date=29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies suggest that a large proportion of shoppers are tempted to shoplift due to the relative ease of fooling self-checkouts. For example, a person who (initially without intent to steal) does not scan an item, may remember that this was easy, and fail to scan other items deliberately.&lt;ref name="cran"&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Clare|title=Self-scan fail: Supermarkets lose billions as thieving customers help themselves|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/money/saving/selfscan-fail-supermarkets-lose-billions-as-thieving-customers-help-themselves-20140130-31o3p.html|work=canberratimes.com.au|publisher=Fairfax Media|accessdate=3 April 2014|date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 survey with 4,952 respondents in the UK found that a third of shoppers had stolen this way, with around a quarter of the remainder stating they were deterred by the risk of detection. Non-barcode items such as produce, and store staff overriding (or ignoring) checkout alerts, were singled out as vulnerabilities, and poverty was not seen as a major factor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2135284/How-cheating-checkouts-turning-nation-self-service-shoplifters.html How cheating at checkouts is turning us into a nation of self-service shoplifters] - Daily Mail online, 26 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of one store video surveillance system estimated that "Theft — intentional or not — is up to five times higher with self checkout than when cashiers are working", although behaviour of shoplifters is becoming well known, and stores are now better at shoplifting detection.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Self-checkout lanes boost convenience, theft risk|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/story/2012-04-06/self-scanning-checkout/54117384/1|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=3 April 2014|date=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 survey in{{Fix|text=where?}} of 2,634 respondents confirmed the same general findings, but commented that the cost of additional theft was evidently seen as "tolerable" compared to the cost of other processes, such as manned checkouts, and harm due to poorer customer service arising from the slowness of manned versus automated checkouts.&lt;ref name="cran" /&gt;

=== Customer effort ===
In 2002, a study was carried out where people with disabilities used self-checkout machines, and found that existing checkout machines were not designed for [[accessibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bajaj|first1=Komal|last2=Mirka|first2=Gary A.|last3=Sommerich|first3=Carolyn M.|last4=Khachatoorian|first4=Haig|title=Evaluation of a Redesigned Self-Checkout Station for Wheelchair Users|journal=Assistive Technology|date=31 March 2006|volume=18|issue=1|pages=15–24|doi=10.1080/10400435.2006.10131903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Customer interaction ===
Self-checkouts are also criticized for reducing the possibilities for customers and store staff to interact, and adversely affecting customer service in general.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt; Self-checkout lanes may lack some rather basic customer interactions, like informing the customer that a coupon was not accepted, and why.

=== Low reliability ===
Being more complex, self-checkouts are more prone to failure. For example, they use scales to weigh goods in the bagging area, and if the scale fails, the machine does not work. Also, in a manned checkout lane, any simple problems like lack of receipt paper would be immediately fixed by the operator, while self-checkouts may not be fixed for quite some time. This lack of reliability can be compensated for by having excess lanes available or enough staff on hand to perform immediate maintenance.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Scanning while shopping ==
[[File:Giant Food Scan It.jpg|thumb|right|"Scan It" kiosk at [[Giant-Landover|Giant Food]] store.]]
An alternative system (self-scanning) consists of a portable barcode scanner that is used by the customer to scan and bag items while shopping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zimmerman|first1=Ann|title=Check Out the Future of Shopping|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703421204576329253050637400|website=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=7 December 2016|date=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the customer has finished shopping, the scanner is brought to a checkout [[kiosk]], where the information from the barcode scanner is downloaded to the kiosk, usually in conjunction with a [[loyalty program|customer loyalty card]]. The customer pays and receives a receipt at the checkout kiosk. The integrity of the system is maintained through the use of random audits or [[RFID]].

== Hybrid systems ==
[[File:HybridCheckout Combined Cashier and Self-Service Counter.jpg|thumb|right|HybridCheckout supporting parallel scanning]]
Suppliers like ITAB, [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], [[Wincor-Nixdorf]] and others have manufactured hybrid checkout systems that allows the checkout counter to be switched between either a cashier operated mode or a customer self-service mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barwick|first=Hamish|title=Coles trials hybrid self-checkout system in Victoria|url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/444998/coles_trials_hybrid_self-checkout_system_victoria/|work=computerworld.com.au|publisher=IDG Communication|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wincor Nixdorf to present 'Always Open' checkout solution at NRF Big Show|url=http://www.kioskmarketplace.com/article/205861/Wincor-Nixdorf-to-present-Always-Open-checkout-solution-at-NRF-Big-Show|work=kioskmarketplace.com|publisher=Networld Media Group|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HybridCheckout from PeoplePos has taken the hybrid concept further by allowing the cashier and customer to do parallel and simultaneous scanning. This is achieved by adding a customer scanning area next to the cashier scanning area. The HybridCheckout solution allows for an increased throughput and a combination of cashier operated scanning and customer self-service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HybridCheckout|url=http://www.hybridcheckout.com/|work=hybridcheckout.com|publisher=PeoplePos Ltd|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open systems ==
In 2010, the ''[[open-source]]-self-check'' project was announced. By using hardware and open source software, this library self-checkout system costs less than one-tenth of the commercial version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=open-source-self-check|url=https://code.google.com/p/open-source-self-check/|work=google.com|publisher=Google Project Hosting|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/community/managinglibraries/853685-273/self-check_kiosk_from_scratch_iowa.html.csp|title=Self-Check Kiosk from Scratch: Iowa Librarian's Coding Skills Prove Valuable|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511090437/http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/community/managinglibraries/853685-273/self-check_kiosk_from_scratch_iowa.html.csp|archivedate=11 May 2011|df=dmy-all}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
[[BBC News]] reported in December 2009 on the rise of self-service tills and how error messages like 'unexpected item in the bagging area' are becoming part of the new shopping experience and even given rise to [[T-shirts]] bearing the slogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8399963.stm|work=BBC News|first=Denise|last=Winterman|title=The problem with self-service checkouts|date=9 December 2009|accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-serving checkout counters drastically reduce the demand for low skilled workers, using technology to eliminate a key human player in the marketplace. The widespread implementation of self checkout services will result in a decrease in available jobs for low skilled checkout workers, some of whom have depended on such jobs for a living.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Regulation ==
An appeal court in [[California]] confirmed in September 2013 a bill banning sales of alcoholic beverages in self-service checkouts. The law requires alcohol only to be sold in face-to-face transactions with store clerks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Egelko|first=Bob|title=Alcohol can't be sold at self-checkout lines|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Alcohol-can-t-be-sold-at-self-checkout-lines-4831117.php|work=sfgate.com|publisher=SFGate|accessdate=3 April 2014|date=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Smart mine''' refers to a number of next-generation [[land mine]] designs being developed by [[military]] forces around the world. These include mines designed to self-destruct or self-deactivate at the end of a conflict, and mines designed to re-deploy themselves if its neighbors detonate or are removed.&lt;ref name="Eric Daniel"&gt;{{cite web |title=SMART AND DEADLY: The New Breed of Smart Mines  |url=http://www.military.com/soldiertech/0,14632,Soldiertech_Mines,,00.html |publisher=military.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of smart mines began as a response to the [[ICBL|International Campaign to Ban Landmines]] as a way of reducing [[non-combatant]] and [[civilian]] injury.  

Critics claim that new technology is unreliable, and that the perception of a "safe mine" will lead to increased deployment of land mines in future conflicts{{Fact|date=August 2009}}. Current guidelines allow for a 10% failure rate, leaving a significant number of mines to pose a threat. Additionally, in the case of self-destructing mines, civilians still are at risk of injury when the mine self-destructs and are denied access to land which has been mined.&lt;ref name="Ban Mine USA"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Need to Ban “Smart” or Self-Destructing AP Mines |url=http://www.banminesusa.org/qa/smart.htm |publisher=banminesusa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mines are inherently non-discriminate weapons even smart mines may injure civilians during a time of war. Many critics believe this to be unacceptable under international law. The [[human security]] paradigm is outspoken on the issue of the reduction in the use of land mines due to the extremely individual nature of their impact - a facet that is ignored by traditional security concerns which focus on military and state level security issues.

'''Spontaneous human combustion''' ('''SHC''') is a term encompassing reported cases of the [[combustion]] of a living (or very recently deceased) human body without an apparent external source of ignition. In addition to reported cases, examples of the phenomenon appear in literature, and both types have been observed to share common characteristics, regarding circumstances and remains of the victim.

[[Forensic]] investigations have attempted to analyze reported instances of SHC and have resulted in hypotheses regarding potential causes and mechanisms, including victim behavior and habits, alcohol consumption and proximity to potential sources of ignition, as well as the behavior of fires that consume melted fats. Natural explanations, as well as unverified natural phenomena, have been proposed to explain reports of SHC. Current scientific consensus is that most, and perhaps all, cases of SHC involve overlooked external sources of ignition.

== Overview ==
"Spontaneous human combustion" refers to the [[Death by burning|death from a fire]] originating without an apparent external source of ignition; the fire is believed to start within the body of the victim. This idea and the term 'spontaneous human combustion' were both first proposed in 1746 by Paul Rolli in an article published in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://books.google.com/?id=L9NeAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA447| last = Rolli | first = Paul | title=An Extract, by Mr. Paul Rolli, F.R.S. of an Italian Treatise, written by the Reverend Joseph Bianchini, a Prebend in the City of Verona; upon the Death of the Countess Cornelia Zangari &amp; Bandi, of Cesena | date=1746 | publisher = [[Royal Society]] |journal= ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions]]'' | issue = 476 | page = 447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The BMJ|The British Medical Journal]]'' in 1938, [[coroner]] Gavin Thurston describes the phenomenon as having "attracted the attention not only of the medical profession but of the laity" as early as 1834 (more than one hundred years prior to Thurston's article).&lt;ref name="thurston-1938"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Thurston | first = Gavin | title = Spontaneous Human Combustion | journal = [[The BMJ|The British Medical Journal]] | date = 18 June 1938 | volume = 1 | issue = 4041 | page = 1340 | pmc=2086726 | doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4041.1340-a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1995 book ''Ablaze!'', Larry E. Arnold wrote that there had been about 200 cited reports of spontaneous human combustion worldwide over a period of around 300 years.&lt;ref name="arnold-1995"&gt;{{cite book | title = Ablaze!: The Mysterious Fires of Spontaneous Human Combustion | last = Arnold | first = Larry E. | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-87131-789-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characteristics ===
The topic received coverage in the ''British Medical Journal'' in 1938. An article by L. A. Parry cited an 1823-published book ''Medical Jurisprudence'',&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on Medical Jurisprudence'', by Dr John Ayrton Paris M.D. and [[John Samuel Martin Fonblanque]] Barrister at Law, 3 Vols, London, 1823&lt;/ref&gt; which stated that commonalities among recorded cases of spontaneous human combustion included the following characteristics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...]the recorded cases have these things in common:
&lt;!--

# the victims are chronic alcoholics;
# they are usually elderly females;
# the body has not burned spontaneously, but some lighted substance has come into contact with it;
# the hands and feet usually fall off;
# the fire has caused very little damage to combustible things in contact with the body;

Alcoholism is a common theme in early SHC literary references, in part because some [[Victorian era]] physicians and writers believed spontaneous human combustion was the result of [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref name="collins-2011"&gt;{{cite web | title = Spontaneous human combustion: examples from fiction | last = Collins | first = Nick | work = The Telegraph | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/8784947/Spontaneous-human-combustion-examples-from-fiction.html | date = 23 September 2011 | accessdate = 2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forensic investigation ==

An extensive two-year research project, involving thirty historical cases of alleged SHC, was conducted in 1984 by science investigator [[Joe Nickell]] and forensic analyst John F. Fischer. Their lengthy, two-part report was published in the journal of the [[International Association of Arson Investigators]],&lt;ref name="Nickell Arson 1"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Nickell| first=Joe| authorlink=Joe Nickell| author2=Fischer, John F. |title=Spontaneous Human Combustion| journal=The Fire and Arson Investigator| date=March 1984| volume=34|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3–11}} as well as part of a book.&lt;ref name="Yotam Aviram"&gt;{{cite book| last=Nickell| first=Joe| authorlink=Joe Nickell| title=Secrets of the Supernatural| year=1991| publisher=Prometheus Books| location=Amherst, NY| pages=149–57, 161–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nickell has written frequently on the subject,&lt;ref name="Nickell Arson 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yotam Aviram" /&gt; appeared on television documentaries, conducted additional research, and lectured at the New York State Academy of Fire Science at [[Montour Falls, New York]], as a guest instructor.

Nickell and Fischer's investigation, which looked at cases in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, showed that the burned bodies were in close proximity to plausible sources for the ignition: candles, lamps, fireplaces, and so on. Such sources were often omitted from published accounts of these incidents, presumably to deepen the aura of mystery surrounding an apparently "spontaneous" death. The investigations also found that there was a correlation between alleged SHC deaths and the victim's intoxication (or other forms of incapacitation) which could conceivably have caused them to be careless and unable to respond properly to an accident. Where the destruction of the body was not particularly extensive, a primary source of combustible fuel could plausibly have been the victim's clothing or a covering such as a blanket or comforter.

However, where the destruction was extensive, additional fuel sources were involved, such as chair stuffing, floor coverings, the flooring itself, and the like. The investigators described how such materials helped to retain melted fat, which caused more of the body to be burned and destroyed, yielding still more liquified fat, in a cyclic process known as the "[[wick effect]]" or the "candle effect".

According to Nickell and Fischer's investigation, nearby objects often remained undamaged because fire tends to burn upward, but burns laterally with some difficulty. The fires in question are relatively small, achieving considerable destruction by the wick effect, and relatively nearby objects may not be close enough to catch fire themselves (much as one can closely approach a modest campfire without burning). As with other mysteries, Nickell and Fischer cautioned against "single, simplistic explanation for all unusual burning deaths" but rather urged investigating "on an individual basis".&lt;ref name="Yotam Aviram" /&gt;{{rp|169}}

Neurologist [[Steven Novella]] has said that skepticism about spontaneous human combustion is now bleeding over into becoming popular skepticism about spontaneous combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/268
 | title=Skeptics Guide to the Universe #268 | work=[[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]]
 | date=1 September 2010 | accessdate=13 June 2016}} At 26:38, [[Steve Novella]] says "I think that part of the knee-jerk skepticism is that we hear things like spontaneous human combustion—we know that's total BS—and then when you hear just spontaneous combustion it triggers the same response as if it has anything to do with spontaneous human combustion but it really doesn't. I hear that a lot, too, a lot of people think that anything to do with magnets must be crap
because there's so much magnet pseudoscience out there but that doesn't mean that there aren't legitimate uses of magnets in medicine.
We can affect brain function with [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]], for example.
But again people make that association, that's just a little too simplistic, that magnets equal pseudoscience, that spontaneous combustion equals pseudoscience, but this is perfectly legitimate."&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 study by Angi M. Christensen of the [[University of Tennessee]] cremated both healthy and osteoporotic samples of human bone and compared the resulting color changes and fragmentation. The study found that osteoporotic bone samples "consistently displayed more discoloration and a greater degree of fragmentation than healthy ones." The same study found that when human tissue is burned, the resulting flame produces a small amount of heat, indicating that fire is unlikely to spread from burning tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Christensen |first=Angi M. |orig-year=2002 |title=Experiments in the Combustibility of the Human Body |url=https://www.astm.org/DIGITAL_LIBRARY/JOURNALS/FORENSIC/PAGES/JFS15287J.htm |journal=[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]] |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=466–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suggested explanations ==
Some hypotheses attempt to explain how SHC might occur without an external flame source, while other hypotheses suggest that incidents that might appear as ''spontaneous'' combustion did in fact have an external source of ignition – and that the likelihood of spontaneous human combustion without an external ignition source is quite low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://skepdic.com/shc.html |title=Skeptic's Dictionary on spontaneous human combustion, Retrieved Oct 20, 2007 "The physical possibilities of spontaneous human combustion are remote." |publisher=Skepdic.com |date=24 September 2011 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Radford]], science writer and deputy editor of the science magazine ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', casts doubt on the plausibility of spontaneous human combustion, "If SHC is a real phenomenon (and not the result of an elderly or infirm person being too close to a flame source), why doesn't it happen more often? There are 5 billion [The world's population reached 5 billion in 1987] &lt;!-- NOTE: "5 BILLION" IS FROM WHEN THE QUOTE WAS TAKEN, NOT MEANT TO BE UPDATED BY WIKIPEDIA (it's also hilarious wrong as world population hit 5 billion in 1987 – I mean that's 24 years back) --&gt;people in the world, and yet we don't see reports of people bursting into flame while walking down the street, attending football games, or sipping a coffee at a local Starbucks."&lt;ref name="The Body Odd on MSNBC.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://bodyodd.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/09/26/7976119-irishman-died-of-spontaneous-human-combustion-coroner-claims| title=Irishman died of spontaneous human combustion, coroner claims| publisher=MSNBC| date=26 September 2011| accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paranormal researcher [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]] states that SHC stories "are simply the rare cases where a natural death in isolation has been followed by a slow combustion from some nearby source of ignition." He further suggested that reports of people suddenly aflame should be called "Unsolved deaths by fire", stating that an unknown cause did not necessarily imply that the fire lacked an external ignition source.&lt;ref name=Skeptoid&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4258|number=258| title=Spontaneous Human Combustion|date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural explanations ===
* Almost all cases of SHC involve persons with low mobility due to advanced age or [[obesity]], along with poor health.&lt;ref name=Skeptoid /&gt; Victims show a high likelihood of having died in their sleep, or of being unable to move once they had caught fire.
* [[Cigarette]]s are often seen as the source of fire, as the improper disposal of smoking materials causes one in every four fire deaths in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/cigarette_fires.html |title=Cigarettes' Role in Fires Growing |publisher=Consumeraffairs.com |date= 9 August 2004|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural causes such as [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] may lead to the victim dying, subsequently dropping the cigarette, which after a period of smouldering can ignite the victim's clothes.&lt;ref name="nickell1998"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Fiery tales that spontaneously destruct – reports on spontaneous human combustion – includes an investigative chronology based on a published photograph| work=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]| author=Joe Nickell| authorlink=Joe Nickell| volume=22.2| date=March–April 1998| url= http://www.csicop.org/si/show/fiery_tales_that_spontaneously_destruct/|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "[[wick effect]]" hypothesis suggests that a small external flame source, such as a burning cigarette, chars the clothing of the victim at a location, splitting the skin and releasing [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] fat, which is in turn absorbed into the burned clothing, acting as a wick. This combustion can continue for as long as the fuel is available. This hypothesis has been successfully tested with animal tissue (pig) and is consistent with evidence recovered from cases of human combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Palmiere C, Staub C, La Harpe R, Mangin P | title=Ignition of a human body by a modest external source: a case report| journal=Forensic Sci Int| year=2009| pmid=19410396| doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2009.03.027| volume=188| issue=1–3| pages=e17–19| postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CAMPBELL&gt;{{Cite journal| volume=39| issue=1| pages=27–38| last=Campbell| first=S. J.| author2=S. Nurbakhsh |title=Combustion of animal fat and its implications for the consumption of human bodies in fires| journal=Science &amp; Justice| year=1999| postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human body typically has enough stored energy in fat and other chemical stores to fully combust the body; even lean people have several pounds of fat in their tissues. This fat, once heated by the burning clothing, wicks into the clothing much as candle wax (which typically was originally made of animal fat) wicks into a lit candle wick to provide the fuel needed to keep the wick burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Watson| first=Stephanie| title=How Spontaneous Human Combustion Works| url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/unexplained-phenomena/shc.htm| work=HowStuffWorks| publisher=HowStuffWorks Inc.| accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protein in the body also burns, but provides less energy than fat, with the water in the body being the main impediment to combustion. However, slow combustion, lasting hours, gives the water time to evaporate slowly. In an enclosed area, such as a house, this moisture will recondense nearby, possibly on windows.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}} Feet don't typically burn because they often have the least fat; hands also have little fat, but may burn if resting on the abdomen, which provides all of the necessary fat for combustion.
* [[Scalding]] can cause burn-like injuries, sometimes leading to death, without setting fire to clothing. Although not applicable in cases where the body is charred and burnt, this has been suggested as a cause in at least one claimed SHC-like event.&lt;ref name=nickell1996b /&gt;
* [[Brian J. Ford]] has suggested that [[ketosis]], possibly caused by [[alcoholism]] or low-carb dieting, produces [[acetone]], which is highly [[flammable]] and could therefore lead to apparently spontaneous combustion.&lt;ref name="Microscope"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ford |first=Brian J. |authorlink=Brian J.

* SHC can be confused with [[self-immolation]] as a form of suicide. In the West, self-immolation accounts for 1% of suicides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Shkrum|first1 = M J|last2 = Johnston|first2 = K A|title = Fire and suicide: a three-year study of self-immolation deaths|journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences|date = January 1992|volume = 37|issue = 1|pages = 208–21|pmid = 1545201}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Radford claims in developing countries the figure can be as high as 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tourjee|first1=Diana|title=Why a Woman in Germany Just Spontaneously Combusted |url= https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/why-a-woman-in-germany-just-spontaneously-combusted|website=Broadly|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pseudoscientific and fictional theories ===
* Larry E. Arnold in his 1995 book ''Ablaze!'' proposed a [[pseudoscientific]] new subatomic particle, which he called "pyrotron".&lt;ref name="arnold-1995" /&gt;{{rp|99–106}}&lt;ref name=nickell1996b /&gt; Arnold also wrote that the flammability of a human body could be increased by certain circumstances, like increased alcohol in the blood.&lt;ref name="arnold-1995" /&gt;{{rp|84}}&lt;ref name=nickell1996b /&gt; He further proposed that extreme stress could be the trigger that starts many combustions.&lt;ref name="arnold-1995" /&gt;{{rp|163}}&lt;ref name=nickell1996b /&gt; This process may use no external oxygen to spread throughout the body, since it may not be an "[[oxidation-reduction]]" reaction;{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} however, no reaction mechanism has been proposed. Researcher Joe Nickell has criticised Arnold's hypotheses as based on [[selective evidence]] and [[argument from ignorance]].&lt;ref name=nickell1996b /&gt;
* In his 1976 book ''Fire From Heaven'', UK writer [[Michael Harrison (writer)|Michael Harrison]] suggests that SHC is connected to poltergeist activity because, he argues "the force which activates the 'poltergeist' originates in, and is supplied by, a human being". Within the concluding summary, Harrison writes: "SHC, fatal or non-fatal, belongs to the extensive range of poltergeist phenomena."{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
*John Abrahamson suggested that [[ball lightning]] could account for spontaneous human combustion. "This is circumstantial only, but the charring of human limbs seen in a number of ball lightning cases are very suggestive that this mechanism may also have occurred where people have had limbs combusted," says Abrahamson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1720#.U50cjLGeud8|title=Ball lightning scientists remain in the dark|last=Muir|first=Hazel|date=20 December 2001|website=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable examples ==
On 2 July 1951, [[Mary Reeser]], a 67-year-old woman, was found burned to death in her house after her landlady realised that the house's doorknob was unusually warm. The landlady notified the police, and upon entering the home, they found Reeser's remains completely burned into ash, with only one leg remaining. The chair she was sitting in was also destroyed. During the investigation, detectives found that Reeser's temperature was around {{convert|3500|F|C K}}, which puzzled the investigators, as almost everything else in the room in which Reeser was found remained intact. Reeser took [[sleeping pills]] and was also a smoker. A common theory was that she was smoking a cigarette after taking sleeping pills, and then fell asleep while still holding the burning cigarette, which could have ignited her gown, ultimately leading to her death. Investigators also found that the fire had burned a socket, which stopped a clock at 2:26am, suggesting that Reeser had died at around that time.&lt;!--Is this last sentence relevant to the argument against SHC?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sARZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lE8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3822,1539798&amp;dq=mary+reeser&amp;hl=en|title=No New Clues In Reeser Death; Debris Sent To Lab|date=5 July 1951|pages=14|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|author=Jerry Blizin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret Hogan, an 89-year-old widow who lived alone in a house on Prussia Street, [[Dublin]], was found burned almost to the point of complete destruction on 28 March 1970. Plastic flowers on a table in the centre of the room had been reduced to liquid and a television with a melted screen sat 12 feet from the armchair in which the ashen remains were found; otherwise, the surroundings were almost untouched. Her two feet, and both legs from below the knees, were undamaged. A small coal fire had been burning in the grate when a neighbour left the house the previous day; however, no connection between this fire and that in which Mrs. Hogan died could be found. An inquest, held on 3 April 1970, recorded death by burning, with the cause of the fire listed as "unknown".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/offbeat/ashes-and-cinders-a-spontaneous-combustion-on-prussia-street-1.3369596|title='Ashes and cinders': A spontaneous combustion on Prussia Street|date=4 Feb 2018|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|author=Dean Ruxton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Thomas, a 73-year-old man, was found burned to death in the living room of his council house on the [[Rassau]] estate in [[Ebbw Vale]], [[South Wales]], in 1980. His entire body was incinerated, leaving only his skull and a portion of each leg below the knee. The feet and legs were still clothed in socks and trousers. Half of the chair in which he had been sitting was also destroyed. Police forensic officers decided that the incineration of Thomas was due to the [[wick effect]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John E. |last=Heymer |authorlink=John E. Heymer |year=1996 |title=The Entrancing Flame |location= London |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown &amp; Co']] |isbn=0-316-87694-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, the [[death of Michael Faherty]] in [[County Galway]], Ireland, was recorded as "spontaneous combustion" by the coroner. The doctor, Ciaran McLoughlin, made this statement at the inquiry into the death: "This fire was thoroughly investigated and I'm left with the conclusion that this fits into the category of spontaneous human combustion, for which there is no adequate explanation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Ensor |first=Josie |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/8783929/Irish-pensioner-died-of-spontaneous-human-combustion.html |title=Irish pensioner 'died of spontaneous human combustion' |publisher=Telegraph |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent reported case of apparent SHC occurred in the early afternoon of 17 September 2017 in [[Tottenham]], north London, when a 70-year-old [[pensioner]], John Nolan from [[County Mayo]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], appeared to spontaneously burst into flames while walking in the street. Some passers-by tried to help him at the scene and he was airlifted to hospital where he died the next day, having suffered severe third-degree burns on 65% of his body. At the time, investigators were unable to establish a reason for this incident and his death was treated as unexplained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishpost.com/news/john-nolan-irish-pensioner-found-flames-london-street-134897|title=Who was John Nolan?

The coroner concluded that Mr. Nolan accidentally set fire to himself while lighting a cigarette and the cause of death was given as "accidental ignition of clothing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishpost.com/news/irish-pensioner-found-in-flames-on-london-street-accidentally-set-himself-on-fire-while-lighting-cigarette-155055|title=Irish pensioner found in flames on London street accidentally set himself on fire while lighting cigarette|first=Ryan|last=Price|date=22 May 2018|publisher=''[[The Irish Post]]''|access-date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Despite official cause of death given, this case is still notable in SHC article because it was treated as "unexplained" at the time and the SHC theory was raised.--&gt;

'''Temporal isolation''' or '''performance isolation''' among [[virtual machines|virtual machine]] (VMs) refers to the capability of [[Temporal isolation|isolating the temporal behavior]] (or limiting the temporal interferences) of multiple VMs among each other, despite them running on the same physical host and sharing a set of physical resources such as processors, memory, and disks.

==Introduction to the problem==
One of the key advantages of using [[Hardware virtualization|virtualization]] in [[server consolidation]], is the possibility to seamlessly "pack" multiple under-utilized systems into a single physical host, thus achieving a better overall utilization of the available hardware resources. In fact, an entire [[Operating System]] (OS), along with the applications running within, can be run in a [[virtual machine]] (VM).
However, when multiple VMs concurrently run on the same physical host, they share the available physical resources, including [[CPU]](s), [[network adapter]](s), [[disk storage|disk]](s) and memory. This adds a level of unpredictability in the performance that may be exhibited by each individual VM, as compared to what is expected. For example, a VM with a temporary compute-intensive peak might disturb the other running VMs, causing a significant and undesirable temporary drop in their performance. In a world of computing that is shifting towards [[cloud computing]] paradigms where resources (computing, storage, networking) may be remotely rented in virtualized form under precise service-level agreements, it would be highly desirable that the performance of the virtualized resources be as stable and predictable as possible.

==Possible solutions==
Multiple techniques may be used to face with the aforementioned problem. They aim to achieve some degree of [[temporal isolation]] across the concurrently running VMs, at the various critical levels of [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduling]]: CPU scheduling, network scheduling and disk scheduling.

For the CPU, it is possible to use proper scheduling techniques at the hypervisor level to contain the amount of computing each VM may impose on a shared physical CPU or core. For example, on the [[Xen]] hypervisor, the BVT, Credit-based and S-EDF schedulers have been proposed for controlling how the computing power is distributed among competing VMs.&lt;ref name="XenCPUSchedulers"&gt;

To get stable performance in virtualized applications, it is necessary to use scheduler configurations that are not [[Work-conserving scheduler|work-conserving]].
Also, on the [[Kernel-based Virtual Machine|KVM]] hypervisor, some have proposed using EDF-based scheduling strategies&lt;ref name="Checconi09"&gt;Fabio Checconi, Tommaso Cucinotta, Dario Faggioli, Giuseppe Lipari,

to maintain stable and predictable performance of virtualized applications.&lt;ref name="Cucinotta09"&gt;Tommaso Cucinotta, Gaetano Anastasi, Luca Abeni,

For the network, it is possible to use [[traffic shaping]] techniques to limit the amount of traffic that each VM can impose on the host. Also, it is possible to install multiple network adapters on the same physical host, and configure the virtualization layer so that each VM may grant exclusive access to each one of them. For example, this is possible with the driver domains of the Xen hypervisor. Multi-queue network adapters exist which support multiple VMs at the hardware level, having separate packet queues associated to the different hosted VMs (by means of the IP addresses of the VMs), such as the Virtual Machine Device Queue (VMDq) devices by [[Intel]].&lt;ref name="VMDq"&gt;Shefali Chinni, Radhakrishna Hiremane, [http://software.intel.com/file/1919 Virtual Machine Device Queues], Intel Virtualization Technology White Paper, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, real-time scheduling of the CPU may also be used for enhancing temporal isolation of network traffic from multiple VMs deployed on the same CPU.&lt;ref name="Cucinotta10"&gt;Tommaso Cucinotta, Dhaval Giani, Dario Faggioli and Fabio Checconi, [http://retis.sssup.it/~tommaso/eng/publications.html#L_VHPC10 Providing Performance Guarantees to Virtual Machines using Real-Time Scheduling], Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Virtualization and High-Performance Cloud Computing (VHPC 2010), Ischia (Naples), Italy, August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

When using real-time scheduling for controlling the amount of CPU resources reserved for each VM, one challenging problem is properly accounting for the CPU time applicable to system-wide activities. For example, in the case of the Xen scheduler, the Dom0 and the driver domains services might be shared across multiple VMs accessing them. Similarly, in the case of the KVM hypervisor, the workload imposed on the host OS due to serving network traffic for each individual guest OS might not be easily distinguishable, because it mainly involves kernel-level device drivers and the networking infrastructure (on the host OS). Some techniques for mitigating such problems have been proposed for the Xen case.&lt;ref name="Gupta06"&gt;Diwaker Gupta, Lucy Cherkasova, Robert Gardner, Amin Vahdat,

Proceedings of the 7th International Middleware Conference (Middleware 2006), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Volume 4290/2006, pp.342-362, Melbourne, Australia, November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the lines of [[adaptive reservations]], it is possible to apply feedback-control strategies to dynamically adapt the amount of resources reserved to each virtual machine to maintain stable performance for the virtualized application(s).&lt;ref name="Nathuji-EuroSys10"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the trend of adaptiveness, in those cases in which a virtualized system is not fulfilling the expected performance levels (either due to unforeseen interferences of other concurrently running VMs, or due to a bad deployment strategy that simply picked up a machine with insufficient hardware resources), it is possible to [[live migration|live-migrate]] virtual machines while they are running, so as to host them on a more capable (or less loaded) physical host.

'''The Outies,''' formally known as the "Out &amp; Equal Workplace Awards", is an annual awards gala hosted by [[Out &amp; Equal]] Workplace Advocates. The Outies honor individuals and organizations that are leaders in advancing [[Egalitarianism|equality]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Raeburn|first=Nicole Christine|title=Changing corporate America from inside out: lesbian and gay workplace rights By |year=2004|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-3999-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2rdnDOqAagC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=outies+lgbt+award&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WdyGTLyyMYagsQPlqsiNCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 September 2010|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender ([[LGBT]]) employees in America’s workplaces. Through these awards, Out &amp; Equal provides the business and LGBT communities with examples of innovative approaches and proven successes to help create safe and equitable workplaces. The awards are presented annually at the [[Out &amp; Equal Workplace Summit]], a nationwide conference addressing LGBT issues in the workplace.

Outie Awards are given in five different categories, with two recognizing individuals and three recognizing organizations. To win an Outie, recipients must have taken significant action to create more equitable workplaces for members of the LGBT community.

==Award Categories==
The Workplace Excellence Award recognizes any employer that has an historic and ongoing commitment to pursuing and executing workplace equality for LGBT employees in their own workplace. This employer has a history of continually raising the bar of workplace equality for others to follow.&lt;ref name="outandequal.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outandequal.org/outie-awards |title=Overview &amp;#124; Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates |publisher=Outandequal.org |date=2012-11-01 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trailblazer Award recognizes an LGBT person who has made a significant contribution to advancing workplace equality. This individual’s activities will have made a marked improvement in their own workplace and/or have contributed to equality nationally.

The Champion Award recognizes any LGBTQ person or ally who has made a significant contribution to advancing workplace equality. The Champion Award winner will have shown a unique commitment to LGBTQ workplace rights and will have used their talents to further that cause, even if at some risk..

The LGBT ERG of the Year Award recognizes a particular employee resource group (ERG), sometimes referred to as a business group or network, that has a proven track record of success in advocating for LGBT equal rights in its own workplace.

The Regional Affiliate of the Year Award recognizes an Out &amp; Equal regional affiliate that has demonstrated commitment to the Out &amp; Equal mission through exceptional programming and sound organizational practices.

The Significant Achievement Award recognizes any employer that has made significant strides in the past year in advancing a fair and equitable workplace for its LGBT employees, such as: announcing domestic partner health insurance, including gender identity diversity training, or initiating a unique general advertising campaign that includes LGBT people.

==Selection Process==
All Outie nominations are read by the Out &amp; Equal awards committee and judging panel, which is made up of a diverse cross-section of leaders in the movement for LGBT workplace equality. Awards Committee members and judges change each year and are expected to opt out of voting if their own affiliations may bias their votes.

Nominees are evaluated on originality, duplicability of initiatives, leadership, results, and other criteria. Organizations are evaluated based on the aforementioned criteria, plus the degree to which they have incorporated the 20 Steps to an Out &amp; Equal Workplace. The previous year’s awardees are not considered for the same award for the following two years. Additionally, companies or organizations may only submit one nomination in the organization award categories and one nomination in the individual award categories, for a maximum possible total of two nominations from any one company or organization.&lt;ref name="outandequal.org"/&gt;

{{history of war}}

A '''weapon''', '''arm''' or '''armament''' is any device that can be used with intent to inflict damage or harm. Weapons are used to increase the efficacy and efficiency of activities such as [[hunting]], [[crime]], [[law enforcement]], [[self-defense]], and [[war]]fare. In broader context, weapons may be construed to include anything used to gain a tactical, strategic, material or mental advantage over an adversary or enemy target.

While ordinary objects such as sticks, stones, cars, or pencils can be used as weapons, many are expressly designed for the purpose – ranging from simple implements such as [[Club (weapon)|clubs]], [[sword]]s and [[axe]]s, to complicated modern [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s, [[biological warfare|biological]] weapons and [[cyberweapon]]s. Something that has been re-purposed, converted, or enhanced to become a weapon of war is termed '''weaponized''', such as a [[weaponized virus]] or [[weaponized lasers|weaponized laser]].

=== Ancient history ===
[[File:Ballista-quadrirotis.jpeg|thumb|A four-wheeled [[ballista]] drawn by armored [[cataphract]] horses, {{circa|400}}.]]
The earliest [[List of ancient weapons|ancient weapons]] were evolutionary improvements of late [[neolithic]] implements, but significant improvements in materials and crafting techniques led to a series of revolutions in [[military technology]].

The development of metal tools began with [[copper]] during the [[Copper Age]] (about 3,300&amp;nbsp;BC) and was followed by the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] Age, leading to the creation of the [[Bronze Age sword]] and similar weapons.

During the Bronze Age, the first defensive structures and [[fortifications]] appeared as well,&lt;ref name=ashow-siegecraft&gt;{{cite web |title=A Short History of War |author=Gabriel, Richard A. |author2=Metz, Karen S. |url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/gabrmetz/gabr0001.htm |accessdate=2010-01-08 |website=au.af.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating an increased need for security. Weapons designed to breach fortifications followed soon after, such as the [[battering ram]] was in use by 2500&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=ashow-siegecraft /&gt;

The development of [[History of ferrous metallurgy|iron-working]] around 1300 BC in Greece had an important impact on the development of ancient weapons. It was not the introduction of  early [[Iron Age sword]]s, however, as they were not superior to their bronze predecessors, 
but rather the [[Domestication of the horse|domestication of the horse]] and widespread use of [[spoke]]d wheels by ca. 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/wheel-and-axle-woi |title=Wheel and Axle Summary |publisher=BookRags.com |date=2010-11-02 |accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the creation of the light, horse-drawn [[chariot]], whose improved mobility proved important during this era.&lt;ref name="Whedbee 2005 p. 50"&gt;{{cite book | last=Whedbee | first=J. | title=Myths and Realities: Conflicting Currents of Culture and Science | publisher=iUniverse | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-595-36239-4 | url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=yb5GUc5QVIUC&amp;pg=PA50 | access-date=May 21, 2018 | page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spoke-wheeled chariot usage peaked around 1300&amp;nbsp;BC and then declined, ceasing to be militarily relevant by the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s70986.htm |title=Science Show: The Horse in History |publisher=abc.net.au |date=1999-11-13 |accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to land based weaponry, [[warship]]s, such as the [[trireme]], were in use by the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/war/Trireme.htm |title=The Trireme (1/2) |publisher=Mlahanas.de |accessdate=2011-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619175837/http://mlahanas.de/Greeks/war/Trireme.htm |archivedate=2011-06-19 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-classical history ===
[[File:Racinet1.jpg|thumb|left|Medieval Indian weapons]]
[[File:Tower of London interior.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient Chinese [[cannon]] displayed in the [[Tower of London]].]]
European warfare during the [[Post-classical history]] was dominated by elite groups of [[knights]] supported by massed [[infantry]] (both in combat and ranged roles). They were involved in mobile combat and [[sieges]] which involved various [[siege weapon]]s and tactics. Knights on horseback developed tactics for charging with [[lances]] providing an impact on the enemy formations and then drawing more practical weapons (such as [[sword]]s) once they entered into the melee. By contrast, infantry, in the age before structured formations, relied on cheap, sturdy weapons such as [[spear]]s and billhooks in close combat and [[Bow (weapon)|bows]] from a distance. As armies became more professional, their equipment was standardized and infantry transitioned to [[pike (weapon)|pikes]]. Pikes are normally seven to eight feet in length, and used in conjunction with smaller side-arms (short sword).

In Eastern and [[Middle Eastern]] warfare, similar tactics were developed independent of European influences.

The introduction of [[gunpowder]] from the Asia at the end of this period revolutionized warfare. Formations of [[musketeers]], protected by [[pikemen]] came to dominate open battles, and the [[cannon]] replaced the [[trebuchet]] as the dominant [[siege weapon]].

=== Modern history ===

==== Early modern ====
The European [[Renaissance]] marked the beginning of the implementation of firearms in western warfare. [[Gun]]s and [[rocket]]s were introduced to the battlefield.

[[Firearm]]s are qualitatively different from earlier weapons because they release energy from combustible [[propellant]]s such as [[gunpowder]], rather than from a counter-weight or spring. This energy is released very rapidly and can be replicated without much effort by the user. Therefore even early firearms such as the [[arquebus]] were much more [[power (physics)|powerful]] than human-powered weapons. Firearms became increasingly important and effective during the 16th century to 19th century, with progressive improvements in [[Lock (firearm)|ignition mechanisms]] followed by revolutionary changes in [[ammunition]] handling and propellant. During the [[U.S. Civil War]] new applications of firearms including the [[machine gun]] and [[ironclad warship]] emerged that would still be recognizable and useful military weapons today, particularly in [[limited war|limited conflicts]]. In the 19th century [[warship]] propulsion changed from [[sail]] power to [[fossil fuel]]-powered [[steam engine]]s.

Since the mid-18th century North American French-Indian war through the beginning of the 20th century, human-powered weapons were reduced from the primary weaponry of the battlefield yielding to gunpowder-based weaponry. Sometimes referred to as the "Age of Rifles",&lt;ref&gt;p.263, Hind&lt;/ref&gt; this period was characterized by the development of firearms for infantry and cannons for support, as well as the beginnings of mechanized weapons such as the [[machine gun]]. 
Of particular note, [[Howitzer]]s were able to destroy masonry fortresses and other fortifications, and this single invention caused a [[Revolution in Military Affairs]] (RMA), establishing tactics and doctrine that are still in use today. ''See [[Technology during World War I]] for a detailed discussion.''

==== Late modern ====
[[File:Vickers machine gun in the Battle of Passchendaele - September 1917.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25| The [[Vickers machine gun|Vickers]] was the successor to the [[Maxim gun]] and remained in British military service for 79 consecutive years.]]

An important feature of [[industrial age]] warfare was [[technological escalation]] – innovations were rapidly matched through replication or countered by another innovation. The [[Technology during World War I|technological escalation during World War I]] (WW I) was profound, including the wide introduction of [[aircraft]] into [[Technology during World War I|warfare]], and naval warfare with the introduction of [[aircraft carrier]]s.

[[World War I]] marked the entry of fully industrialized warfare as well as [[weapons of mass destruction]] (''e.g.'', [[chemical weapon|chemical]] and [[biological weapons]]), and new weapons were developed quickly to meet wartime needs. Above all, it promised to the military commanders the independence from the [[horse]] and the resurgence in [[maneuver warfare]] through extensive use of motor vehicles. The changes that these [[Military technology during World War II|military technologies]] underwent before and during the [[World War II|Second World War]] were evolutionary, but defined the development for the rest of the century.

This period of innovation in weapon design continued in the inter-war period (between WW I and [[technological escalation during World War II|WW II]]) with continuous evolution of weapon systems by all major industrial powers. Many modern military weapons, particularly ground-based ones, are relatively minor improvements of weapon systems developed during [[World War II]]. ''See [[military technology during World War II]] for a detailed discussion.''

[[World War II]] however, perhaps marked the most frantic period of weapons development in the history of humanity. Massive numbers of new designs and concepts were fielded, and all existing technologies were improved between 1939 and 1945. The most powerful weapon invented during this period was the [[atomic bomb]], however many other weapons influenced the world in ways overshadowed by the importance of nuclear weapons.

===== Nuclear weapons =====
{{Main|Nuclear holocaust}}
Since the realization of [[mutually assured destruction]] (MAD), the nuclear option of all-out war is no longer considered a survivable scenario.  During the [[Cold War]] in the  years following [[World War II]], both the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a [[nuclear arms race]]. Each country and their allies continually attempted to out-develop each other in the field of nuclear armaments. Once the joint technological capabilities reached the point of being able to ensure the destruction of the Earth x100 fold, then a new tactic had to be developed.  With this realization, armaments development funding shifted back to primarily sponsoring the development of conventional arms technologies for support of [[limited war]]s rather than [[total war]].&lt;ref name="NuclearDefunding"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2004 |journal=The Ploughshares Monitor |volume=25 |issue=4 |author=Estabrooks, Sarah |url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/monitor/mond04f.htm |title=Funding for new nuclear weapons programs eliminated |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620191013/http://www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/monitor/mond04f.htm |archivedate=June 20, 2007}} Report on congressional refusal to fund additional nuclear weapons research.There was a guy named Henry Bond he was around 74 years old&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture of weapons==
{{expand section|date=May 2018}}
{{main|Arms industry}}

The arms industry is a global industry that involves the sales and manufacture of weaponry. It consists of a [[commerce|commercial]] [[industry]] involved in the [[research and development]], [[engineering]], production, and servicing of [[military]] material, equipment, and facilities.

== Legislation ==
The production, possession, trade and use of many weapons are controlled. This may be at a [[local government|local]] or [[central government]] level, or international treaty. Examples of such controls include:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* The [[right of self-defense]]
* [[Knife legislation]]
* [[Air gun laws]]
* [[Gun law]]
* [[Arms trafficking]] laws
* [[Arms control]] treaties
* [[Space Preservation Treaty]]
{{div col end}}

===Gun laws===
{{expand section|date=May 2018}}
{{main|Gun laws}}
All countries have laws and policies regulating aspects such as the manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification and use of small arms by civilians. 

Countries which regulate access to firearms will typically restrict access to certain categories of firearms and then restrict the categories of persons who may be granted a license for access to such firearms. There may be separate licenses for hunting, sport shooting (a.k.a. target shooting), self-defense, collecting, and concealed carry, with different sets of requirements, permissions, and responsibilities.

===Arms control laws===
{{Main|Arms control}}
International treaties and agreements place restrictions upon the development, production, stockpiling, proliferation and usage of weapons from [[small arms]] and [[Artillery|heavy weapon]]s to [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Arms control is typically exercised through the use of diplomacy which seeks to impose such limitations upon consenting participants, although it may also comprise efforts by a nation or group of nations to enforce limitations upon a non-consenting country.

===Arms trafficking laws===
{{expand section|date=May 2018}}
{{main|Arms trafficking}}
Arms trafficking is the trafficking of contraband weapons and [[ammunition]]. What constitutes legal trade in firearms varies widely, depending on local and national laws.

== Lifecycle problems ==
There are a number of issue around the potential ongoing risks from deployed weapons, the safe storage of weapons, and their eventual disposal when no longer effective or safe.
