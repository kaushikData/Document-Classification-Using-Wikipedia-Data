The '''Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909''' or '''Bangkok Treaty of 1909''' was a [[treaty]] between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] signed on 10 March 1909, in [[Bangkok]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Intelligence and Research, Office of the Geographer, [http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS057.pdf "International Boundary Study: Malaysia - Thailand Boundary," No. 57] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916034515/http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS057.pdf |date=16 September 2006 }}, 15 November 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Ratifications were exchanged in London on 9 July 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Great Britain, ''Treaty Series'', No. 19 (1909)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{History of Malaysia}}

The [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] was controlled by the monarch. Siam's ability to maintain its independence from British and French colonizers is often been credited to the ruling family, the [[Chakri Dynasty|Chakkri]] dynasty. Although there were many previous monarchs of the Chakkri dynasty, those most responsible for maintaining Siam's independence begins with [[Rama I]] (r.1782-1809). Unlike previous rulers, Rama I was a technocratic ruler who consulted with social elites on political matters and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] (Buddhist monks) on religious matters. His consultations with the Siamese elites became {{em|de rigueur}} for his successors.&lt;ref name=Owen-2005&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Owen |editor1-first=Norman G |title=The Emergence of Modern Southeast Asia; A New History |date=2005 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |location=Honolulu |isbn=9780824828905 |edition=Paper|url=https://books.google.co.th/books?id=py5Xh0-pw18C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=9780824828905&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjir8mb35feAhWHtI8KHZluD-IQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=9780824828905&amp;f=false |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|94}} Rama I was succeeded by [[Rama II of Siam|Rama II]] (r.1809-1824). Rama II's greatest accomplishment was the establishment of a government of ministers. Near the end of his reign, in 1820, the British came on the scene seeking control of [[Penang]]. Rama II was followed by [[Rama III]] (r.1824-1851). He granted concessions to the British in exchange for their support. The same would be done later with the French.&lt;ref name=Owen-2005/&gt;{{RP|95}} In 1826, in an effort to establish independence, Rama III and British officials signed the [[Burney Treaty]]. The treaty affirmed British assent that [[Kedah]], [[Perlis]], [[Terengganu]], and [[Pattani Kingdom|Patani]] were Thai provinces while Penang and [[Province Wellesley]] belonged to the British and that the Siamese would permit British trade in Kelantan and Terengganu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suwannathat-Pian|first1=Kobuka|title=The 1839-41 Settlements of Kedah: The Siamese Compromise|journal=Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society|date=1986|volume=59|issue=1|pages=33–48|jstor=41493034}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Rama III's reign, a succession crisis brought [[Mongkut]] (r.1851-1868) to power. Under Mongkut's leadership the [[Bowring Treaty]] of 1855 was signed. It  provided British subjects in Siam with [[extraterritoriality]], meaning that Britons would have British laws applied to them rather than Siamese. Mongkut constantly made concessions to the British and French to maintain independence in Siam until, in 1868, he was succeeded by [[Chulalongkorn]], who ruled from 1868 to 1910. Chulalongkorn was a moderniser, similar to his predecessors. He abolished slavery, centralised revenues, created a national educational system, and safeguarded Siamese independence.

==Treaty==
The Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, signed under the leadership of Chulalongkorn, consists of eight articles;

=== Article 1 ===
"The Siamese government transfers to the British government all rights of suzerainty, protection, administration and control whatsoever which they possess over the states of Kelantan, Tringganu, Kedah, Perlis, and adjacent islands. The frontiers of these territories are defined by the boundary protocol annexed hereto."

=== Article 2 ===
The transfer provided for in the preceding article shall take place within thirty days after the ratification of this treaty.

=== Article 3 ===
A mixed commission, composed of Siamese and British officials and officers, shall be appointed within six months after the date of ratification of this treaty and shall be charged with the delimitation of the new frontier. The work of the commission shall be commenced as soon as the season permits, and shall be carried out in accordance with the boundary protocol annexed hereto.

Subjects of his majesty the king of Siam residing within the territory described in article 1 who desire to preserve their Siamese nationality will, during the period of six months after the ratification of the present treaty, be allowed to do so if they become domiciled in the Siamese dominions. His Britannic majesty's government under take that they shall be at liberty to retain their immovable property within the territory described in article 1.

It is understood that in accordance with the usual custom where a change of suzerainty takes place, any concessions within the territories described in article 1 hereof to individuals or companies, granted by or with the approval of the Siamese government, and recognised by them as still in force on the date of the signature of the treaty, will be recognised by the government of his Britannic majesty.

=== Article 4 ===
His Britannic majesty's government undertake that the government of the [[Federated Malay States]] shall assume the indebtedness to the Siamese government of the territories described in article 1.

=== Article 5 ===
The jurisdiction of the Siamese International Courts, established by article 8 of the treaty of 3 September 1883, shall, under the conditions defined in the jurisdiction protocol annexed hereto, be extended to all British subjects in Siam registered at the British consulates before the date of the present treaty.

This system shall come to an end, and the jurisdiction of the International Courts shall be transferred to the ordinary Siamese courts after the promulgation and the coming into force of the Siamese codes, namely, the penal code, the civil and commercial codes, the codes of procedure, and the law for organisation of courts.

All other British subjects in Siam shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the ordinary Siamese courts under the conditions defined in the jurisdiction protocol.

=== Article 6 ===
British subjects shall enjoy throughout the whole extent of Siam the rights and privileges enjoyed by the natives of the country, notably the right of property the right of residence and travel.

They and their property shall be subject to all taxes and services, but these shall not be other or higher than the taxes and services which are or maybe imposed by law on Siamese subjects. It is particularly understood that the limitation in the agreement of 20 September 1900, by which the taxation of land shall not exceed that on similar land in Lower Burmah, is hereby removed.

British subjects in Siam shall be exempt from all military service, either in the army or navy, and from all forced loans or military exactions or contributions.

===Article 7===
The provisions of all treaties, agreements, and conventions between Great Britain and Siam, not modified by the present treaty remain in full force.

===Article 8===
The present treaty shall be ratified within four months from its date.

In witness where of the respective plenipotentiaries have signed the present treaty and affixed their seals.
Done at Bangkok, in duplicate, the 10th day of March, in the year 1909."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Treaty between Great Britain and Siam|journal=The American Journal of International Law |date=1909 |volume=3|issue=4|pages=297–304|jstor=2212641|doi=10.2307/2212641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{unreferenced|section|date=March 2017}}
This agreement has had a long-lasting impact on both Thailand and the [[Federation of Malaysia]]. The border between them was largely determined by this treaty. The dissatisfaction generated by the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909 may have, in part, laid the foundations for the South Thailand insurgency in [[Pattani]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], and [[Narathiwat]] from the 1960s to the present. The agreement effectively divided the northern [[Malay states]] into two parts. The area around modern [[Pattani Province|Pattani]] ({{lang-ms|ڤتنا (Patani)}}), [[Narathiwat Province|Narathiwat]] ({{lang-ms|منارة (Menara)}}), southernmost [[Songkhla Province|Songkhla]] ({{lang-ms|سيڠڬورا (Singgora)}}), [[Satun Province|Satun]] ({{lang-ms| مقيم ستل (Mukim Setul)}}), and [[Yala Province|Yala]] ({{lang-ms|جال (Jala)}}) remained under [[Thailand|Thai]] control, while Thailand relinquished its claims to [[sovereignty]] over [[Kedah]] ({{lang-th|ไทรบุรี (Saiburi)}}), [[Kelantan]] ({{lang-th|กลันตัน (Kalantan)}}), [[Perlis]] ({{lang-th|ปะลิส (Palit)}}) and [[Terengganu]] ({{lang-th|ตรังกานู (Trangkanu)}}) which integrated the British [[sphere of influence]] as protectorates. These four states, along with [[Johor]], later became known as the [[Unfederated Malay States]]. Although the treaty had cultural impacts and was responsible for giving away pieces of land, it was also responsible for maintaining the independence of Siam.

[[File:Polling station.jpg|thumb|Entrance to polling station run by the Australian Electoral Commission (Australian Federal Elections 2016)]]
The '''Australian Electoral Commission''' ('''AEC''') is the federal independent agency in charge of organising, conducting and supervising federal elections and referendums. 

== States and territories ==
State and local government elections are overseen by separate Electoral Commissions in each state and territory:
* [[New South Wales Electoral Commission]]
* [[Electoral Commission of Queensland]]
* [[Victorian Electoral Commission]]
* [[Electoral Commission of South Australia]]
* [[Tasmanian Electoral Commission]]
* [[Western Australian Electoral Commission]]
* [[Northern Territory Electoral Commission]]
* [[Australian Capital Territory Electoral Commission]].

==Responsibilities==
The AEC's main responsibility is to conduct [[Elections in Australia|federal elections]], by-elections and [[Referendums in Australia|referendums]]. The AEC is also responsible for seat boundaries and [[Redistribution (Australia)|redistribution]]s, and the maintenance of an up-to-date [[Electoral register|electoral roll]]. Under the Joint Roll Arrangements, the AEC maintains the electoral roll for the whole of Australia, which is used by the state and territory Electoral Commissions to conduct their elections. The AEC publishes detailed election results and follows up electors who fail to vote

The AEC is also responsible for monitoring the activities of registered political parties, including receiving returns from parties of donations and expenditures, and the publication of the information. The AEC also plays an [[electoral education]] role, aiming to educate citizens about the electoral process by which representatives are elected, and by which the [[Australian Constitution]] is changed (referendums). It also plays a role in industrial voting (e.g., votes on industrial action).

=== Public funding of elections ===
{{Main|Political funding in Australia}}

Political parties in Australia are publicly funded by the AEC, to reduce the influence of private money upon elections, and subsequently, the influence of private money upon the shaping of public policy. After each election, the AEC distributes a set amount of money to each political party, per vote received. For example, after the 2013 election, political parties and candidates received $58.1&amp;nbsp;million in election funding. The [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] received $23.9&amp;nbsp;million in public funds, as part of the Coalition total of $27.2&amp;nbsp;million, while the Labor Party received $20.8&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nov 27, 2013 |url=http://australianpolitics.com/2013/11/27/federal-election-funding-payments.html |title=AEC Finalises $58 Million Of Election Funding To Candidates In Federal Election |publisher=Australianpolitics.com |date=2013-11-27 |accessdate=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and structure==
The ''Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/cea190219o1902279/ ''Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902'']&lt;/ref&gt; set up the framework for the Commonwealth electoral system, which was administered until 1916 as a branch of the [[Department of Home Affairs (1901–16)|Department of Home Affairs]], then until 1928 by the [[Department of Home and Territories (1916-1928)|Department of Home and Territories]], back to [[Department of Home Affairs (1928–32)|Department of Home Affairs]] until 1932 and then [[Department of the Interior (1932–39)|Department of the Interior]] until 1972. The Australian Electoral Office was created in 1973 by the ''[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004C02075 Australian Electoral Office Act 1973]''. On 21 February 1984 the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) was established as a Commonwealth [[statutory authority]]. 

The AEC is answerable to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/em/index.htm |title=Parliament of Australia: Joint Committee on Electoral Matters: Home Page |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2010-12-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110108184910/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/em/index.htm| archivedate= 8 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Parliament of Australia]], and must report on how elections were carried out and the success of elections in general.

The AEC was created by and operates under the ''[[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]]''. It consists of a chairman (a Judge or a retired Judge of the Federal Court), the Electoral Commissioner and a non-judicial member (usually the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics|Australian Statistician]]). The Electoral Commissioner has the powers of a Secretary of a Department under the ''Public Service Act 1999'' and the ''Financial Management and Accountability Act 1998''. The Chairperson and the third, non-judicial member both hold their offices on a part-time basis.

Each [[Divisions of the Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives electorate]] has a Divisional Returning Officer responsible for administration of elections within the division. Each State also has an Australian Electoral Officer responsible for administration of Senate elections. The AEC has a National Office in [[Canberra]] and an office in each State and Territory: [[Adelaide]], [[Brisbane]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Hobart]], [[Melbourne]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and Sydney.

==Voter registration ==
In Australia voter registration is called "enrolment", and the electoral register is called an "[[Electoral system of Australia#Electoral rolls|electoral roll]]". A permanent Australian federal electoral roll has been maintained since 1908, and enrolment has been compulsory for federal elections since 1912. The AEC maintains Australia's federal electoral roll, which is used for federal elections and referendums. Each state also has its own electoral commission or office, but voters need to register only with the AEC which shares the registration details with the relevant state electoral commission, except in the case of Western Australia, which maintains its own electoral roll. The federal roll also forms the basis of state (except in Western Australia) and local electoral rolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://eca.gov.au/systems/australia/by_category/joint_rolls.htm |title=Joint Rolls Arrangement between Commonwealth, State and Territories |access-date=25 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120003728/http://eca.gov.au/systems/australia/by_category/joint_rolls.htm |archive-date=20 January 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AEC registration covers federal, state and local voter registration. In Australia and in each state and territory, it is a legal offence to fail to vote (or, at the very least, attend a polling station and have one's name crossed off the roll) at any federal or state election, punishable by a nominal fine. The amount varies between federal and state elections. (The fine for not voting is currently A$75.00 in Victoria. This figure is indexed at the beginning of every financial year.) Usually people are issued with warnings when it is found that they have not voted, and they are given an opportunity to show cause. Acceptable reasons for not voting may include being in the accident department of a hospital, being ill (requires confirmation), being out of the country on election day, religious objections, being incarcerated, etc. "I forgot" is not considered acceptable and will incur a fine. Section 245 of the ''Electoral Act'' (Cwth) provides that if an elector has been asked the "true reason" for his failure to vote states that he did not do so because it was against his religion, this statement shall be regarded as conclusive, and no further action will be taken.

Traditionally, voters cannot register within three weeks of an election. In 2004 the [[John Howard|Howard]] government passed legislation that prevented registration after 8&amp;nbsp;pm on the day that [[Writ of election|the writs]] were issued (this can be up to 10 days after the election has been announced).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aec.gov.au/About_AEC/Publications/Fact_Sheets/Close_of_Rolls.htm|title=Deadlines for enrolling to vote for federal elections|author=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation was considered controversial by some Australians who contended it [[disenfranchise]]d first-time voters or those who have forgotten to update their enrolment. The law was repealed just before the 2010 federal election, after advocacy group [[GetUp!]] obtained a High Court ruling&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rowe v Electoral Commissioner]]'', {{cite AustLII|litigants=|year=2010|court=HCA|num=46}}; (2010) 243 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1&lt;/ref&gt; that the changes were unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/08/06/2975602.htm |title=High Court upholds GetUp! case|author=ABC News Australia|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  16 and 17 year olds can provisionally enrol and are able to vote when they turn 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enrolment – Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/FAQs/Enrolment.htm|website=Australian Electoral Commission|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Byzantine–Venetian treaty of 1268''' was an agreement between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Republic of Venice]], that brought to a temporary end the hostilities between the two powers, that had erupted after the Byzantine recovery of [[Constantinople]] by [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1261. A first treaty was concluded in 1265 but not ratified by Venice, until the rise of [[Charles of Anjou]] in Italy forced both powers to seek an accommodation. A new treaty was concluded in April 1268. It provided for a mutual truce of five years, the release of prisoners, and readmitted and regulated the presence of Venetian merchants in the Empire. Many of the trading privileges they had previously enjoyed were restored, but on considerably less advantageous terms to Venice than what Palaiologos had been willing to concede in 1265. The Byzantines were forced to recognize the Venetian possession of [[Venetian Crete|Crete]] and other areas captured after the [[Fourth Crusade]], but succeeded in avoiding a full rupture with the [[Republic of Genoa]], Venice's main rival and an [[Treaty of Nymphaeum (1261)|ally]] of Byzantium since 1261, while removing for a time the threat of a Venetian fleet assisting Charles of Anjou in his plans to capture Constantinople.

==Background==
In the aftermath of the [[Fourth Crusade]], the [[Republic of Venice]], which had provided the Crusaders with their fleet, [[Partitio Romaniae|received]] many of the spoils of the fallen [[Byzantine Empire]]: three-eighths of the Byzantine capital, [[Constantinople]], and numerous strategically positioned colonies, including [[Crete]].{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=13}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|pp=148–159}} This event opened the [[Black Sea]] to Venetian trade, while Venetian influence in Constantinople ensured that throughout the newly established [[Latin Empire]], the Venetians gained a privileged position, which secured their ascendancy over their old commercial rivals, the fellow [[Italian maritime republics]] of [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]].{{sfn|Lane|1973|pp=68–69}} 

===Byzantine–Genoese–Venetian relations under Michael VIII Palaiologos===
[[File:Michael VIII Palaiologos (head).jpg|thumb|right|Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] (14th-century miniature from [[George Pachymeres]]' ''History'').]]
As a result, the recovery of Constantinople by the [[Nicaean emperor]] [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1261, and the re-establishment of the [[Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty]], was a major blow to the position and interests of Venice. This was all the more since, in the search of a means with which to counter the mighty [[Venetian fleet]], Palaiologos had allied with the Genoese, who were already [[War of Saint Sabas|at war]] with Venice, in the [[Treaty of Nymphaeum (1261)|Treaty of Nymphaeum]]. This agreement not only gave the Genoese great privileges, but also assigned them the former quarters and property of the Venetians in Constantinople and threatened to exclude the Venetians from the Black Sea trade.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=81–89}} 

Initially, the Venetians supported the exiled Latin Emperor, [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]], in his efforts to form a new Crusade and reclaim his throne,{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=141–142}} and Venetian diplomacy henceforth "served to bind together Latin projects to retake the capital", in the words of Deno Geanakoplos.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=147}} Barred from the Black Sea and Constantinople by her rival, Venice now followed a two-pronged strategy of using the [[Papacy]] and the threat of [[excommunication]] to pry the Genoese away from the Byzantines, and of obtaining the assistance of other Western powers, like [[Manfred of Sicily]], for a campaign against Palaiologos.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=148–150}} In the meantime, Venetian naval activity in the [[Aegean Sea]] did not provide any concrete results. In the summer of 1262, the Venetians ordered a 37-galley fleet into the Aegean, which met the Genoese fleet of 60 ships at [[Thessalonica]], but the Genoese refused to engage. A piratical foray by the nobles of [[Lordship of Negroponte|Negroponte]], allied with Venice, into the [[Marmara Sea]] was confronted and defeated by a Byzantine–Genoese squadron.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=151}}{{sfn|Lane|1973|p=76}} 

In 1263, however, the [[Battle of Settepozzi]] ended in a clear Venetian victory, and much diminished the value of the Genoese alliance in the eyes of Palaiologos,{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=153–154}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=180}} who was furthermore annoyed by the Genoese captains' preference for attacking Venetian shipping for booty rather than assisting in supplying his forces fighting in the [[Morea]], and concerned at the growth of Genoese influence in his own capital, as they threatened to acquire even more of a stranglehold on commerce than the Venetians had ever possessed. Soon after the battle Michael VIII dismissed sixty Genoese ships from his service. Both sides became increasingly mistrustful of each other, and Michael began to delay the payments for the crews of the Genoese ships.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=180}}{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=154, 161–164}} The Byzantine–Genoese rift widened further in 1264, when the Genoese ''[[podestà]]'' in Constantinople was implicated in a plot to surrender the city to [[Manfred of Sicily]], whereupon the emperor expelled the Genoese from the city to [[Heraclea Perinthus]].{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=180}}{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=168–171}}

===The unratified treaty of 1265===
Palaiologos then sent a Venetian prisoner of war, Arrigo Trevisano, as his envoy to Venice. Doge [[Reniero Zeno]] sent Trevisano back to Constantinople, along with Benedetto Grillone, who in turn were replaced by Jacopo Dolfin and Jacopo Contarini. On 18 June 1265, a first treaty of truce was signed by Palaiologos and the Venetian envoys in Constantinople. Its terms were highly advantageous to the Venetians, and would, in the opinion of Geanakoplos, almost restore to her the position she had enjoyed before 1261.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=182–183}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=181}} The Greek and Latin texts of the treaty are preserved in the collection of Venetian diplomatic documents compiled by Gottlieb Tafel and Georg Thomas and published by the [[Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna]].{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1857|pp=62–89}}

Its main provisions were:
# The cession to Venice of designated quarters for her colonists in Constantinople, [[Thessalonica]], and other Byzantine cities, with the recognition of a Venetian ''[[Bailo of Constantinople|bailo]]'' as the chief Venetian official in the Empire{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=182}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=181}}
# Venetian merchants were exempted from all taxes in the Empire{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=182–183}}
# The Genoese were to be entirely expelled from the Empire, and any future Byzantine treaties with Genoa would require the consent of Venice{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=183}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=181}}
# Venice would remain at peace with the Byzantines even if a friendly power—the Papacy, [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Charles of Anjou]], Pisa, and [[Ancona]] were explicitly mentioned—should attack Constantinople{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=183}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|pp=181, 189}}
# If the Genoese should attack Constantinople, Venice should come to the aid of the city with a fleet of equal size to that of Genoa{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=183}}
# Venetian possession of Crete, and the two outposts of [[Methoni, Messenia|Modon]] and [[Koroni|Coron]] on the Morea were recognized by Palaiologos{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=183}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=181}}
# Palaiologos received a free hand against the Latin lords of Negroponte, while the Venetian citizens there were prohibited from aiding them, in exchange for an guarantee of their own properties and position on the island{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=183}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=181}}
# The other Latin territories in the Aegean captured after the Fourth Crusade, including the feudatories of the [[Principality of Achaea]], were to be returned to Palaiologos{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=183}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|pp=181–182}}

The treaty was not ratified by the Doge, however, for reasons not clear: according to Geanakoplos, either the Venetians interpreted Palaiologos' concessions as a sign of weakness, or mistrusted his ultimate intentions, since his desire to restore the Byzantine Empire to its pre-1204 boundaries was obvious and directly affected their own possessions in the area.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=183–184}} Furthermore, as [[Donald Nicol]] points out, Zeno still cherished the title, conferred in 1204, of "Lord of one-quarter and one-eighth of the Empire of Romania" (''dominus quartae partis et dimidiae totius Imperii Romaniae''), and would be loath to accept a treaty that recognized him merely as "Doge of Venice and Lord of Croatia, Dalmatia, and the other places and islands subject to his authority" ({{lang-la|Dux Venetiarum et dominator Chroatiae et Dalmatiae et omnium aliarum terrarum et insularum suae}}, {{lang-gr|δοὺξ Βενετίας καὶ ἐξουσιαστὴς Χορβατίας, Δαλματίας καὶ τῶν ὑπὸ τὴν ἐξουσίαν αὐτοῦ λοιπῶν χωρῶν τε καὶ νησίων}}) and that effectively diminished his standing and reverted the relations between Venice and Constantinople to the ''status quo'' before 1204.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=182}} In light of this, Venice may have hoped to secure, or even augment, her position in the area with the aid of either Manfred of Sicily or the new and ambitious contender for supremacy in Italy, Charles of Anjou, whose ultimate designs on Constantinople were common knowledge, as can be seen from his inclusion in the draft treaty by Palaiologos.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=183, 184–185}}

===The rise of Charles of Anjou===
[[File:Charles d’Anjou couronné roi de Sicile.png|thumb|Coronation of [[Charles of Anjou]] as [[King of Sicily]] (14th-century miniature). His imperial ambitions forced Palaiologos to seek an accommodation with Venice.]]
Following his decisive victory over Manfred at the [[Battle of Benevento]] in February 1266, Charles of Anjou, now master of Italy, began to plan for the realization of his ambtions against Constantinople.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=192}} His plans were made public with the [[Treaty of Viterbo]] in May 1267, concluded between Charles, the exiled Latin Emperor Baldwin, the Papacy, and the Principality of Achaea. Charles pledged to assist Baldwin in recovering his capital and territories that had once belonged to the Latin Empire, in exchange for several territorial concessions in the Aegean and the western Balkans, and the suzerainty over Achaea. In an effort to lure the cautious Venetians into the pact, they were promised the full restoration of the rights they had enjoyed after 1204.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=197–199}} Concerned over Charles' ambitions, and with his previous treaty with Venice null and void, Palaiologos turned again to Genoa, allowing the establishment of a Genoese colony in the suburb of [[Galata]], across the [[Golden Horn]] from Constantinople.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=190}}{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=206–208}} 

These developments disquietened the Venetians as well: their trade with the East had suffered considerably following the Byzantine alliance with Genoa, while Charles of Anjou's imperial ambitions in the Adriatic and Greece were a potential threat to Venice's own freedom of access to the Mediterranean. Consequently on 1 November 1267, Doge Reniero Zeno sent two plenipotentiary ambassadors, Marco Bembo and Pietro Zeno, to negotiate a treaty with Palaiologos.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=190}}{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=213–214}}

==The treaty of 1268==
The Byzantine–Venetian treaty was concluded on 4 April 1268 at Constantinople. Palaiologos' position vis-à-vis Venice had improved in the years since 1265. As a result, the terms of the new treaty were considerably less advantageous to the Venetians, who furthermore felt compelled to recognize Palaiologos with the title ''imperator et moderator Romanorum'' ("emperor and governor of the [[Rhomaioi|Romans]]"), rather than ''Graecorum'' ("of the Greeks") as in 1265, and with the flattering appellation "the new [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]]", which Palaiologos had adopted after recovering Constantinople.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=214, esp. note 91}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=191}} The treaty was ratified by Doge Zeno on 30 June, but he died a few days later. Palaiologos quickly sent ambassadors to Venice, George Tzimiskes and George Kalodoukas, who were able to secure its recognition by Zeno's successor, [[Lorenzo Tiepolo]], on 30 July.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=215–216}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=192}}{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1857|pp=101–102}}

===Terms===
The [[Latin]] text of the treaty is published in the collection of Venetian documents by Tafel and Thomas.{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1857|pp=92–100}} The terms of the treaty were:
# A truce of five-year duration, on both land and sea, beginning from 4 April 1268, between the Republic of Venice and the "Empire of Romania". Venice pledged not to attack Byzantium or any territory subject to it, nor to ally with any power against it—a clear reference to Charles of Anjou—nor to allow any Venetian ships captains or nobles to engage with "other kings, princes, barons or counts" in designs against Byzantine territories, nor would Venice allow Venetian ships to be used to carry troops against the Emperor's territories.{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1857|pp=94–95}}{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=214}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=191}} 
# All Greek prisoners held at Crete, Modon and Coron, Negroponte, or other places, would be released immediately, and be free to either stay in the same locations or depart to wherever they wished.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=191}}{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1857|p=95}} Palaiologos promised to do the same with any Venetians incarcerated in Byzantine territory, and prohibit the manufacture and sale of weapons for use against the Venetians.{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1857|p=99}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=192}}
# Likewise the Emperor pledged "on the True and Venerable Cross according to the customs of the Greeks and the Holy Gospels of God" to observe the same terms, to ensure that no harm would befall the Venetians on Crete or any other of their possessions, and to remove any of his men from Crete (where Byzantine troops had been sent in support of the [[Kingdom of Candia#Uprisings of the Chortatzes brothers|revolt of the Chortatzes brothers]]). Likewise Palaiologos pledged to not attack the Venetian possessions of Modon and Coron, and the Venetian islands of the Aegean, and to respect the treaty between Venice and the Prince of Achaea concerning Negroponte.{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1857|pp=95–96}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=191}}{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=215}}
# The Venetians would be allowed to settle in Constantinople and any other part of the Empire. This would no longer be in designated quarters provided by the Emperor, but they would be free to rent their own houses, baths, and bakeries on fixed terms, and would have the right to use their own [[weights and measures]] and have their own [[Latin Rite]] churches. The obligation to pay rent was new, but Venetian merchants would again, as before, be exempt from any taxes in the Empire.{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1857|pp=96–97}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=191}}{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=214–215}}
# The Genoese could remain in the Empire—in a marked departure from the treaty of 1265—on the understanding that both Genoese and Venetians would not engage in mutual hostilities between [[Abydos (Hellespont)|Abydos]] on the entrance of the [[Dardanelles]], and the northern entrance to the [[Bosporus]] on the [[Black Sea]]. If either side broke this arrangement, the Emperor would act as arbiter.{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1857|pp=96–97}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=191}}{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=215}}
#  If any Venetian were to die on Byzantine territory, then the disposition of his goods should be entrusted to the Venetian [[rector (politics)|rector]]s or the ''bailo'', or by other Venetians, without interference from the Byzantine authorities.{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1857|pp=97–98}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=192}} 
# Any Venetian vessel or crew suffering shipwreck would receive any assistance possible from the Byzantine authorities to recover their goods.{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1857|p=98}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=192}}
# Venetian ships were allowed to purchase grain anywhere in the Empire and export it without restriction, except to lands hostile to the Empire, for as long as its price remained at 50 gold ''[[hyperpyra]]'' to the 100 ''modioi''; if the price should rise, then export would be allowed only under explicit license by the Emperor.{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1857|p=98}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=192}}
# In the case of a Venetian accused of killing a Byzantine, or another Venetian in Constantinople, the case would be judged by the Emperor, but another offense against a Byzantine, or a murder against another Venetian outside Constantinople, would be judged by a Venetian rector or the ''bailo''.{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1857|pp=98–99}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|pp=191–192}}{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=215}}
# Any damage incurred on Byzantine territories by Venetian corsairs would be restituted by the ''bailo'', who would also be responsible for bringing them to trial. Venice also promised not to provide any assistance, or even harbour, to corsairs acting against the Empire. Acts by Venetians ruling some of the Aegean islands, who were not subject to the Republic, were explicitly exempted from this agreement. Notably, no reference was made to Byzantine corsairs in the agreement, despite their active presence across the region.{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1857|p=99}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=192}}{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=215}}
# Byzantine merchants would have the right to come to Venice and trade in whatever merchandise they wished, without impediment.{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1857|p=100}}

==Aftermath==
The treaty quickly bore fruit for the Byzantines: in September 1269, Charles of Anjou sent the Achaean knight Erard d'Aunoy and the abbot of [[Monte Cassino]] as envoys to Venice to enlist the Republic in his designs against Palaiologos, but the Doge declined, citing the truce.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|pp=193–194}}{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=221}} The Venetian stance reflected both their satisfaction, for the time being, with having again secured commercial access in the Byzantine Empire, as well as their disquiet at Charles' policies in the Adriatic, including a recent agreement with Hungary, traditionally a rival of Venice in [[Dalmatia]].{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=216, 221}} In 1272, as the truce neared its expiration, envoys from Charles, Baldwin, and Palaiologos were all present in Venice, the Byzantine ambassadors bringing with them 500 Venetians seized in Negroponte during the campaigns of the Byzantine admiral [[Licario]]. Amidst the intense diplomatic manoeuvring, including repeated warnings by [[Pope Gregory X]] not to renew the truce the Doge preferred to cautiously wait out developments; accordingly the truce remained tacitly in force, even if it was not officially renewed.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=254–256}}{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=195}} 

Nevertheless, the Venetians had reason to be dissatisfied, as the treaty's provisions regarding the free and safe movement of Venetian merchants and their goods was not scrupulously observed by the Byzantines: in 1278, the Doge submitted more than 300 cases of injury done to Venetian ships, merchants, and goods since 1268, at the hands of the Emperor's subjects; many of them pirates in Imperial employ, but also including soldiers, customs officials and local governors, and even, on one occasion, a ''[[sebastokrator]]'' (possibly Palaiologos' half-brother [[Constantine Palaiologos (half-brother of Michael VIII)|Constantine]]), who had murdered and robbed a Venetian archdeacon captured on a ship off the [[Morea]].{{sfn|Nicol|1992|pp=201–205}}

In 1270, an anti-Angevin coalition took power in Genoa, and in 1272 renewed his alliance with Genoa, now directed against Charles of Anjou.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=245–250}} Palaiologos' diplomatic offensive continued with his rapprochement with the Papacy, which alone could either decisively further (by declaring his campaign against Constantinople a Crusade) or thwart Charles' plans. The terms posed by the Popes were harsh: the Emperor and the Eastern Church would have to confess their errors and accept the supremacy of the Pope.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|pp=194–195}} Faced with the Angevin buildup of naval forces and alliances, Palaiologos had to concede, and the Union of the Churches was proclaimed at the [[Second Council of Lyon]] in 1274.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=259–264}} Although the Union proved deeply unpopular among the Byzantine Church and populace, it was a "diplomatic triumph" for Palaiologos, as the Pope recognized him as legitimate emperor of Constantinople and forbade Charles to attack Palaiologos, who in turn used the opportunity to attack his Greek and Latin rivals in Greece.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|pp=196–197}} 

Although the Venetian representatives at Lyon had vociferously protested that Venice still claimed its rights in "Romania", the advantage lay with Palaiologos, and the new Doge, [[Jacopo Contarini]], in 1276 sent envoys to Constantinople to renegotiate the 1268 treaty. This resulted in an [[Byzantine–Venetian treaty of 1277|agreement concluded]] between Palaiologos and the Venetian envoy Marco Bembo on 19 March 1277. Notably, this agreement was not phrased as a treaty, but rather as a [[chrysobull]], a deed of grant, from the Emperor to Venice. Given the volatile international situation, however, its duration was limited to two years.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|pp=197–201}} After its expiration, it was not renewed, and in 1281, the Venetians in the [[Treaty of Orvieto]] entered Charles' anti-Byzantine coalition, with April 1283 as the projected starting date for the expedition against Constantinople. Charles' designs were, however, fatally interrupted by the outbreak of the [[Sicilian Vespers]] in March 1282 and the consequent [[War of the Sicilian Vespers]].{{sfn|Nicol|1992|pp=207–210}} By the terms of the Treaty of Orvieto, a state of war existed between Venice and Byzantium. The outbreak of the Vespers had ruined Venetian chances to recover their privileged position, and for the duration of the state of war their trade with the East was interrupted, much to the advantage of the Genoese. After long negotiations, a final [[Byzantine–Venetian treaty of 1285|ten-year peace treaty]], essentially renewing the 1277 agreement, was concluded in July 1285.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|pp=212–215}}

'''Cooperative federalism''', also known as '''marble-cake federalism''', is a concept of [[federalism]] in which national, [[State (administrative division)|state]], and [[local government]]s interact cooperatively and collectively to solve common problems, rather than making policies separately but more or less equally (such as the [[dual federalism]] of the 19th-century [[United States]]) or clashing over a policy in a system dominated by the national government.

==Comparison of European Union and United States==

&lt;!-- Lisbon Treaty, because its the first time, we have a tidy list like this. 19th century USA because its the only one I could find, please update it. --&gt;In the [[Lisbon Treaty]] the distribution of competences in various policy areas between Member States and the European union is redistributed in 3 categories. In the United States soon after its creation (1789), it had exclusive competences only (changed somewhat since then, but the basic design remain to this day). Competences not explicitly listed belong to lower levels of governance.

==United States==

In the American federal system, there are limitations on national government's ability to carry out its policies through the executive branch of state governments.  For example, in ''[[Printz v. United States]]'', 521 U.S. 898 (1997) the Court held that the national government could not directly require state law enforcement officers to conduct background checks under the Brady firearms legislation.  The court explained that prior decisions warned that "this Court never has sanctioned explicitly a federal command to the States to promulgate and enforce laws and regulations."   And yet, there are significant advantages in a federal system to obtain state assistance in the local implementation of federal programs.  Implementing such programs through national employees would significantly increase the size and intrusiveness of the national government.  Moreover, local implementation may assure that these programs are implemented in ways that take local conditions into account.  

For this reason, Congress has often avoided adoption of completely nationalized programs by one of two devices.  In the first, Congress creates a delivery system for federal programs in which the national government encourages local implementation of a federal program by providing significant matching funds.    In this context, the phrase may be found in a number of Supreme Court and lower court federal cases.   The most frequent early use of the phrase may be found in a series of cases describing the paradigm for federally sponsored welfare programs such as medical assistance or the former [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] (AFDC) programs in which a participating state's program is financed largely by the Federal Government, on a matching fund basis, subject to federal mandatory regulations.   See for example, ''[[King v. Smith]]'' and a series of subsequent AFDC cases.  More recently, the phrase has been used in connection with other federal programs built on the cooperative federalism model. See ''California v. U.S.'' 438 U.S. 645 (1978) (Reclamation Act) and  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-698.ZO.html ''Schaffer v. Weist''] (Special education).  Here, the motivation for State compliance is that absent state compliance with federal conditions, the state loses significant federal funding.  

The second method of encouraging states to implement federal programs is described in ''[[New York v. United States]]'', 505 U.S. 144 (1992). In this form, the Congress states that it will take over the regulation of an activity at the national level, unless the State itself implements its own program of regulation meeting minimum federal standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hills|first=Roderick M.|title=The Political Economy of Cooperative Federalism: Why State Autonomy Makes Sense and "Dual Sovereignty" Doesn'tAuthor|journal=Michigan Law Review|year=1998|volume=96|issue=4|pages=813–944}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, the motivation for State compliance is that absent state regulation, the state loses power over the regulated area entirely.  In ''New York v. United States'', the court explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"....where Congress has the authority to regulate private activity under the [[Commerce Clause]], we have recognized Congress' power to offer States the choice of regulating that activity according to federal standards or having state law preempted by federal regulation. ''[[Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Association]]''. See also ''FERC v. Mississippi''. This arrangement, which has been termed “a program of cooperative federalism,” Hodel, supra, is replicated in numerous federal statutory schemes. These include the [[Clean Water Act]], see Arkansas v. Oklahoma, (Clean Water Act “anticipates a partnership between the States and the Federal Government, animated by a shared objective”); the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970]], see ''[[Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn.]]'', the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, see Department of Energy v. Ohio,  and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, see Kenaitze Indian Tribe v. Alaska."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the federal system places limits on the ability of the national government to require implementation by a State executive branch, or its local political subdivisions, that limitation does not apply in the same way to State judicial systems.  In part, this is because the founders understood that state courts would be courts of general jurisdiction, bound to apply both state and federal law.  In part, it is because the State courts adjudicate cases between citizens who are bound to comply with both state and federal law.  When the Congress seeks to establish federal legislation which governs the behavior of citizens, the Congress is free to choose among three judicial enforcement paradigms.  It may open both federal or state courts to enforcement of that right, by specifically providing concurrent jurisdiction in the federal courts.  It may grant [[exclusive jurisdiction]] to the federal courts, or it may choose to leave enforcement of that right to civil dispute resolution amongst parties in State court.

[[File:Sketch of a Dalkon Shield IUD- 2013-04-9 05-16.jpg|thumbnail|Sketch of a Dalkon Shield IUD.]]

The '''Dalkon Shield''' was a contraceptive [[intrauterine device]] (IUD) developed by the  [[Dalkon Corporation]] and marketed by the [[A.H. Robins]] Company. The Dalkon Shield was found to cause severe injury to a disproportionately large percentage of its users, which eventually led to numerous lawsuits, in which juries awarded millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages.

== History ==
In 1970, the A.H. Robins Company acquired the Dalkon Shield from the Dalkon Corporation, founded by Hugh J. Davis, M.D.  The Dalkon Corporation had only four shareholders: the inventors Davis and Irwin Lerner,&lt;ref name=DavisObit/&gt; their attorney Robert Cohn, and Thad J. Earl, M.D., a medical practitioner in [[Defiance, Ohio]].  In 1971, Dalkon Shield went into the market, beginning in the [[United States]] and [[Puerto Rico]], spearheaded by a large marketing campaign.  At its peak, about 2.8 million women used the Dalkon Shield in the U.S.

At the time of its introduction, the Dalkon Shield was promoted as a safer alternative compared to [[birth control pills]], which at the time was the subject of many safety concerns.&lt;ref name=DavisObit&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/26/us/hugh-j-davis-69-gynecologist-who-invented-dalkon-shield.html |title=Hugh J. Davis, 69, Gynecologist Who Invented Dalkon Shield |journal= The New York Times|author=Thomas Jr., Robert McG. | authorlink = Robert McG. Thomas Jr.|accessdate=September 11, 2016|date=October 26, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial reports in the medical literature raised questions about whether its efficacy in preventing pregnancy and expulsion rate were as good as those claimed by the manufacturer, but failed to detect the tendency of the device to cause septic abortion and other severe infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones RW, Parker A, Elstein M |title=Clinical experience with the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device |journal=[[Br Med J]] |volume=3 |issue=5872 |pages=143–5 |year=1973 |pmid=4720765 |pmc=1586323 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.3.5872.143|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1973, the CDC conducted a survey of 34,544 physicians with practices in gynecology or obstetrics regarding women who had been hospitalized or had died with complications related to the use of an IUD in the previous 6 months. A total of 16,994 physicians responded, yielding 3,502 unique case reports of women hospitalized in the first 6 months of 1973. Based on the survey response rate, the CDC estimated that a total of 7,900 IUD related hospitalizations occurred during this 6-month period. Based on an estimate of 3.2 million IUD users, the CDC estimated an annual device-related hospitalization rate of 5 per 1000 IUD users. The survey also provided 5 reports of device-related fatalities, with four of these related to severe infection. One of the five was associated with the Dalkon Shield. Based on these data, the CDC estimated an IUD-related fatality rate of 3 per million users per year of use, which it compared favorably to the mortality risks associated with pregnancy and other forms of contraception. Importantly, the survey showed that the Dalkon Shield was associated with an increased rate of pregnancy-associated complications leading to hospitalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00049581.htm |title=CURRENT TRENDS IUD SAFETY: REPORT OF A NATIONWIDE PHYSICIAN SURVEY |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1974, approximately 2.5 million women had received the Dalkon intrauterine device.  In June of that year, the Medical Director of A.H. Robins published a letter to the editor of the British Medical Journal stating that the company was aware of an "apparent increase in the number of cases of septic abortions" including 4 fatalities, but stating that "there is no evidence of a direct cause-and-effect relationship between wearing of the Dalkon Shield and the occurrence of [[Sepsis|septicemia]]". The letter recommended precautions including pregnancy tests for women who missed their period and immediate removal of the device in women who were found to be pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Templeton JS |title=Letter: septic abortion and the Dalkon Shield |journal=Br Med J |volume=2 |issue=5919 |pages=612 |year=1974 |pmid=4833976 |pmc=1610760 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.2.5919.612|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 1974, a series of four case reports of septic pregnancies was published in the journal ''Obstretics and Gynecology".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hurt WG |title=Septic pregnancy associated with Dalkon Shield intrauterine device |journal=[[Obstet Gynecol]] |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=491–5 |year=1974 |pmid=4607058 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975, the CDC published a study associating the Dalkon Shield with a higher risk of spontaneous abortion-related death compared to other IUDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cates W, Ory HW, Rochat RW, Tyler CW |title=The intrauterine device and deaths from spontaneous abortion |journal=[[N.

As many as 200,000 women made claims against the A.H. Robins company, mostly related to claims associated with [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] and loss of fertility.  The company eventually filed for bankruptcy.  The company's representatives argued that pelvic infections have a wide variety of causes, and that the Dalkon Shield was no more dangerous than other forms of birth control. Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that the women they represented would be healthy and fertile today if not for the device.  Scientists from the CDC stated that both arguments have merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/06/magazine/the-sad-legacy-of-the-dalkon-shield.html |title=THE SAD LEGACY OF THE DALKON SHIELD|journal=The New York Times |accessdate=|date=1987-12-06|last1=Kolata|first1=Gina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
More than 300,000 lawsuits were filed against the A.H. Robins Company – the largest [[tort]] liability case since [[asbestos]].  The federal judge, [[Miles W. Lord]], attracted public commentary for his judgments, personal liabilities and public rebukes of the company heads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952466,00.html Time Magazine, “A Panel Tries to Judge a Judge”, Jul. 23, 1984, By MICHAEL S. SERRILL]&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of litigation and settlements (estimated at billions of dollars) led the company to file for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection in 1985. As a result, Robins sold the company to American Home Products (now [[Wyeth]]). {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

In 1976, the [[Medical Device Regulation Act|Medical Device Amendments]] to the [[Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] mandated the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, for the first time, to require testing and approval of "medical devices", including IUDs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The Dalkon Shield became infamous for its serious design flaw: a porous, multifilament string upon which bacteria could travel into the uterus of users, leading to sepsis, injury, miscarriage, and death. Modern [[Intrauterine devices]] (IUDs) use monofilament strings, which do not pose this grave risk to users.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] between 4 and 16 June 1967. The new constitution created a unitary state with a [[presidential system]], whereby the president would be selected by a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|National Assembly]] and then approved by a referendum. It also abolished presidential term limits, limited the number of political parties to two, and gave women the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/drcsecondrepublic.htm DRC: Elections under the Second Republic] [[Electoral Institute for the Sustainability of Democracy in Africa|EISA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosposed constitution was approved by 97.8% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M &amp; Thibaut, B (1999) ''Elections in Africa: A data handbook'', p291 {{ISBN|0-19-829645-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3715">The '''European Group on Tort Law''', sometimes called the '''Spier/Koziol group''',&lt;ref name="Hondius14"&gt;Hondius et al, ''Towards a European Civil Code'' (2004), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[academic]] group devoted to revising tort principles that are supposed to be common to Europe. 

In 1992 Jaap Spier, who at the time was a professor of law at the [[Universiteit van Tilburg]], called together a group of scholars to discuss fundamental questions of [[tort law]] on a comparative basis. After exploring the limits of liability, this “Tilburg Group” embarked on quite a demanding project – the drafting of "[[Principles of European Tort Law]]” ([[Principles of European Tort Law|PETL]]).

The group, now known under the name “European Group on Tort Law”, has grown considerably in the meantime and currently comprises twenty members. These include Francesco D. Busnelli, Giovanni Comandé (both Pisa, Italy), Herman Cousy (Leuven, Belgium), Dan Dobbs (Arizona, USA), Bill Dufwa (Stockholm, Sweden), Michael Faure (Maastricht, the Netherlands), Israel Gilead (Jerusalem, Israel), Michael Green (Wake Forest, USA), Konstantinos D. Kerameus (Athens, Greece), Bernhard A. Koch (Innsbruck, Austria), [[Helmut Koziol]] (Vienna, Austria), Ulrich Magnus (Hamburg, Germany), Miquel Martín-Casals (Girona, Spain), Jorge F. Sinde Monteiro (Coimbra, Portugal), Olivier Moréteau (Baton Rouge, USA), Johann Neethling (Pretoria, South Africa), W.V. Horton Rogers (Leeds, UK), Jaap Spier (the Hague, the Netherlands), [[Luboš Tichý]] (Prague, Czech Republic), Pierre Widmer (Berne, Switzerland).

In order to create an institutional basis for the drafting of the [[Principles of European Tort Law|Principles]], the [[European Centre of Tort and Insurance Law]] (ECTIL) was founded by the group in [[Vienna]] ([[Austria]]) at the beginning of 1999. ECTIL also undertakes further research projects in the field of tort and insurance law and is now supported by the [http://www.etl.oeaw.ac.at Institute for European Tort Law] of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

In 2009, the Group has resumed work on the Principles with an eye to expanding the scope of supporting projects and to incorporating all the feedback collected so far. New members include Bjarte Askeland (Bergen, Norway), Ewa Baginska (Torun, Poland), Eugenia Dacoronia (Athens, Greece), Anne Keirse (Utrecht, the Netherlands), Ken Oliphant (Vienna, Austria), Vibe Ulfbeck (Copenhagen, Denmark) and Bénédict Winiger (Geneva, Switzerland).

'''Gartside v Sheffield''' [1983] NZLR 37 is a cited case in [[New Zealand]] regarding liability for negligence cases against lawyers &lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Winnifred Herrold, aged 89, after suffering a fall and being admitted to a retirement home, on 2 October 1978 contacted her solicitor at the law firm of Sheffield, Young &amp; Ellis (later to merge with Chapman Trip) to draw up a new will to leave the bulk of her estate to Jack Gartside. The solicitor visited her at her resthome on 5 October and took her instructions to draw up the new will.

However, Herrold died on 12 October, without her solicitor getting her to sign the new will. This resulted in Gartside getting nothing from the estate, as the estate was given to her sister under a previous will.

Gartside claimed the lawyers were negligent, whilst the lawyers said they did not owe a duty of care to a mere beneficiary.

Gartside sued the 5 partners of the law firm, which were able to get his claim struck out by the High Court.

He appealed.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal reinstated his claim, saying they did owe a duty of care to a beneficiary.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Grenada]] on 6 November 2018.&lt;ref name=CNS&gt;[https://caribbeannewsservice.com/now/antigua-antigua-and-grenada-to-hold-ccj-referendum-in-november/ ANTIGUA – Antigua and Grenada to hold CCJ Referendum in November] Caribbean News Services, 2 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed constitutional amendment, which voters ultimately rejected, would have made the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] (CCJ) the final [[Appellate court|court of appeal]], replacing the British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], and renamed the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=NG1&gt;[http://www.nowgrenada.com/2018/07/is-grenadas-ccj-referendum-really-about-access-to-justice-part-2/ Is Grenada's CCJ referendum really about access to justice?

==Question==

The '''Group of Thirty''', often abbreviated to '''G30''', is an international body of leading financiers and academics which aims to deepen understanding of economic and financial issues and to examine consequences of decisions made in the public and private sectors related to these issues.  Topical areas within the interest of the group include: the [[foreign exchange market]], international [[capital markets]], international [[financial institutions]], [[central bank]]s and their supervision of financial services and markets, and [[macroeconomic]] issues such as product and labor markets.

The group is noted for its advocacy of changes in global [[Clearing (finance)|clearing]] and [[Settlement (finance)|settlement]].

==History==

The Group of Thirty was founded in 1978 by [[Geoffrey Bell]] at the initiative of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afponline.org/pub/res/news/ns_20050325_g30.html |title=G30 Members Discuss Critical Concerns For American Corporations|author=Karen Epper Hoffman|date=March 25, 2005|work=AFP Online |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205401/http://www.afponline.org/pub/res/news/ns_20050325_g30.html |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also provided initial funding for the body.  Its first chairman was [[Johannes Witteveen]], the former managing director of the [[International Monetary Fund]]. The G30's current Chairman is [[Tharman Shanmugaratnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.group30.org/images/PDF/G30%20November%2022%2011%20Press%20Release%20FINAL.pdf | title=G30 November 22 11 Press Release FINAL | publisher=Group of Thirty | format=PDF | accessdate=October 13, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113171606/http://www.group30.org/images/PDF/G30%20November%2022%2011%20Press%20Release%20FINAL.pdf | archivedate=January 13, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its current Chairman of the Board of Trustees is [[Jacob Frenkel]], and [[Paul Volcker]] is Chairman Emeritus.

The Bellagio Group, formed by Austrian economist [[Fritz Machlup]], was the immediate predecessor to the Group of Thirty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n1/cj3n1-2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Fritz Machlup: In Memoriam|author=[[Gottfried Haberler]]|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|work=[[Cato Journal]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316155055/https://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n1/cj3n1-2.pdf|archivedate=2008-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It first met in 1963, to investigate international currency problems, particularly the [[Bretton Woods Agreement#The U.S. balance of payments crisis (1958–68)|balance of payments crisis]] which America faced throughout the early 1960s.

In June 2011, the group  released a report that examines the most recent developments in the 2008 financial crisis, including the causes, the responses and the future outlook for the United States and other markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://group30.org/publications/detail/151 | title=The 2008 Financial Crisis and Its Aftermath: Addressing the Next Debt Challenge | author=Russo, Thomas A. | author2=Katzel, Aaron J. | publisher=Group of Thirty | format=PDF | accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the European Ombudsman [[Emily O'Reilly]] requested that ECB President [[Mario Draghi]] resign from the group because his membership in the organization could be interpreted as undue influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date = January 17, 2018|title = UPDATE 1 - EU ombudsman urges ECB's Draghi to leave G30 club of financiers|first = Francesco|last = Canepa|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/ecb-banks-ethics/update-1-eu-ombudsman-urges-ecbs-draghi-to-leave-g30-club-of-financiers-idUSL8N1PC2HX|agency = Reuters|access-date = January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The group consists of thirty members and includes the heads of major private banks and central banks, as well as members from academia and international institutions. Current members of the group include current and former heads of the central banks of Argentina, Brazil, [[Great Britain]], [[Canada]], China, [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], [[Poland]], [[Singapore]], [[Spain]], and [[Switzerland]], as well as two chairmen of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]], two presidents of the [[European Central Bank]], a chairman of the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]], two chairmen of the [[Bank for International Settlements]], two chief economists of the [[International Monetary Fund]], a chief economist of the [[World Bank]], and the former President of Mexico. It holds two full meetings each year and also organises seminars, symposia, and study groups. It is based in [[Washington, D.C.]]

{{Gun laws by country}}
'''Gun laws in Pakistan''' allow for the wide ownership of firearms there. Only tribal areas of the province of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] permits the ownership of heavy weaponry including the use of rocket-propelled grenades, short, medium, and long-range rockets, anti-aircraft guns, mortars, etc. These heavy weapons may be made in Pakistan.

The people of the provinces of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]] view the bearing and use of arms as a constitutional right whereas the people of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Baluchistan (Pakistan)|Baluchistan]] view it as part of their culture. Pakistan is also known for its indigenous gunsmith tradition. A notable centre of gun manufacturing is the town of [[Darra Adam Khel]], near [[Peshawar]], historically known for its Lee–Enfield .303 facsimiles and other [[Khyber Pass Copy|Khyber Pass copies]].  However, the town now produces a broader range of [[Weapon|ordnance]] including [[AK-47]]'s, mini-Kalashnikovs, and hand-held firearms, including the ''"[[James Bond]]" [[pen gun]]''.&lt;ref name=palin&gt;Palin, Michael. 2005. ''Himalaya''.  Weidenfeld Nicolson Illustrated.  288 pages. {{ISBN|0-297-84371-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other enduring customs and a strong [[Honour#Cultures of honour and cultures of law|culture of honor]] also promote the prevalence and importance of guns. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the Pashtun residents laud performances of strength and toughness, carrying a [[AK-47]] or other gun is a sign of honour and respect. Similarly, much of mainstream Pakistani culture, including [[Balochi language|Balochi]], [[Sindhi culture|Sindhi]], [[Punjabi culture|Punjabi]] and [[Kashmiri culture|Kashmir]]i cultures, is heavily influenced by guns, as evidenced by common practice of [[Celebratory gunfire|aerial firings]] on special occasions such as weddings. According to [[Michael Palin]], "For Pakistanis, a gun is a social necessity. [[Pashtun people|Pathans]] carry guns the way Londoners carry umbrellas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://palinstravels.co.uk/book-3603|title=Palin's Travels: Pakistan, Himalaya|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the broader Pakistani social necessity of portable and displayable wealth takes on an intimidating form among male members of provincial society.

==History==
The founder of Pakistan [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] held a British firearms certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakwheels.com/forums/non-wheels-discussions/87146-some-rare-pics-jinnah-3|title=Some rare pics of Jinnah - 87146 - Page 3|work=Discussion Forums for Cars in Pakistan - Ask, Answer and Discuss about Vehicles - PakWheels}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[gun politics in the United States]] which is frequently debated, there is little public debate in Pakistan on gun control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/4143/pakistan-needs-a-gun-control-law/|title=Pakistan needs a gun-control law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In no particular order, Pakistanis view weapons as important for one or more of these purposes:

*Repelling an invasion;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/chronology.asp?groupId=77103 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61C4Efpmk?url=http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/chronology.asp?groupId=77103 |archivedate=2011-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
There are an estimated 20 million firearms in public ownership in Pakistan (both legal and illegal), of which 7 million are registered among the country's population of over 220 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/380032/the-weapons-trai-part-1-where-do-20m-illegal-arms-come-from/|title=The Weapons Trail - part 1: Where do 20m illegal arms come from?|date=17 May 2012|work=The Express Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of private gun ownership is 11.6 firearms per 100 people.&lt;ref&gt;Karp, Aaron.2007.‘Completing the Count: Civilian firearms.’ Small Arms Survey 2007: Guns and the City.Cambridge:Cambridge University Press,27 August. (Q5)&lt;/ref&gt; In a comparison of the number of privately owned guns in 178 countries, Pakistan ranks at No.6.&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor, Peter.2003.‘Workshops and Factories: Products and Producers.’ Small Arms Survey 2003: Development Denied.Oxford:Oxford University Press,1 July. (Q2983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GunPolicy.org.2011.‘Calculated Rates – Pakistan.’ Historical Population Data – USCB International Data Base.Suitland, MD:US Census Bureau Population Division,17 March. (Q4277)&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, the homicide rate is 7.3 per 100,000 population, higher than the [[United States]] at 5.0 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref&gt;UNODC.2011.‘Homicide in 207 Countries - Pakistan.’ Global Study on Homicide 2011: Trends, Context, Data.Vienna:United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime,6 October. (Q6299)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current law==
Although owning or possessing a firearm requires licensing in most of Pakistan's provinces, journalist Naeem Sadiq states that most gun licenses are fake, mostly based on forged documents and through government connections and alliances of licenses holders. He also further states that gun licensing laws do not require any background checks or safety targeting or written tests. This also includes a lack of tests on mental health or drug usage by the applicant(s). He argues this to be a contrast to Pakistan's current war against militancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1543116/6-fake-gun-licences/|title=Fake gun licences - The Express Tribune|date=28 October 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadiq also makes mention of [[private security guard]]s who carry firearms in public, repeating the common concern of them harassing and intimidating ordinary citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/137028/eliminating-gun-culture/|title=Eliminating gun culture|work=Naeem Sadiq|publisher=Daily Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another allegation he makes is that many of the rich elite in Pakistan manage to evade gun restrictions and are able to fabricate paper and digital licenses through connections in the government (ie. friends and relatives). They are also allegedly able to avoid penalties on gun-related offenses, including murder because of the current diyat laws, allowing a wealthy person to pay compensation to a deceased victim's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/154071/killer-brats-gun-culture/|title=Of killer brats and gun culture - Daily Times|date=7 December 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the year 2017, Sadiq wrote an open letter to the government to retain its responsibility to protect citizens rather than allow the state to become ‘Republic of Private Security Agencies’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/164523/open-letter-sindh-cm/|title=Open letter to Sindh CM - Daily Times|date=22 December 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Licensing===
There are restrictions on shotguns in Pakistan. The regulation of firearms in Pakistan is categorised as shot gun license.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, George D and Franklin E Zimring.1969.‘Firearm Licensing: Permissive v Restrictive.’ Firearms &amp; Violence in American Life: A Staff Report submitted to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence.Washington, DC:US Government Printing Office,1 January. (Q22)&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistani citizens and special category of foreigners can legally own firearms. A licence is required to purchase a firearm. Acquisition of the licence involves the payment of fees, a processing time ranging from a few days to months, and registration of the firearm with local authorities. Two kinds of licences are currently issued: (1) Prohibited bore and (2) Non-Prohibited bore. They are issued by both the Federal government and Provincial governments. The federal government issues both Prohibited bore (which includes fully automatic weapons) and Non-Prohibited bore (which includes semi-automatic and other weapons) licences for all of Pakistan. Provincial government cannot issue Prohibited Bore licences and their licensing jurisdiction is restricted to their particular province.

Present laws allow ownership of handguns of any calibre, although previously there existed an upper limit restriction of .38-calibre. All shotguns are allowed. Federal prohibited bore permits for civilian fully automatic weapons are issued by the Ministry of the Interior and are valid throughout Pakistan.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt;

In Pakistan, private possession of fully automatic, semi-automatic and handguns (pistols and revolvers) is permitted under licence.&lt;ref name="Pakistan 1965"&gt;Pakistan.1965.‘Pakistan Arms Ordinance.’ Pakistan Arms Ordinance 1965 (W.P. Ord. XX of 1965).Islamabad:Central Government of Pakistan,8 June. (Q4156)&lt;/ref&gt; Only licensed gun owners may lawfully acquire, possess or transfer a firearm or ammunition. Applicants for a gun owner's license are not required to prove genuine reason to possess a firearm. Third party character references are not required. Where a past history, or likelihood of family violence exists, the law in Pakistan does not stipulate that a gun licence should be denied or revoked. An understanding of firearm safety and the law, tested in a theoretical and/or practical training course is not required for a firearm licence. Licensed firearm owners in Pakistan are permitted to possess any number of firearms as well as being permitted to possess any quantity of ammunition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pakistan.1965.‘Unlicensed Possession of Arms.’ Pakistan Arms Ordinance 1965 (W.P.

The total number of firearms destroyed following recent state amnesties, collection and seizure programmes is reported to be 641,107.&lt;ref&gt;Pakistan.2010.‘Initiatives of Government of Pakistan.’ National Report of Pakistan on its Implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects (UNPoA).New York:Permanent Mission of Pakistan to the United Nations,1 June.

Open carry is practiced without restriction in rural Khyber-Pukhtunkhwa and Baluchistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/4458419/content/40862378-guns |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144320/http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/4458419/content/40862378-guns |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Special permits are also required for carrying firearms during times when local authorities impose restrictions on public gatherings to preempt civil unrest or during protests that are expected to become violent. In large cities, target shooting facilities exist for gun enthusiasts to practice.

'''Hogan Lovells''' is an international [[law firm]] co-headquartered in [[London]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]. It was formed on May 1, 2010 by the merger of Washington-based ''Hogan &amp; Hartson'' and London-based ''Lovells''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/30/AR2010043002575.html|title=Hogan Lovells merger makes firm one of largest in U.S.|publisher=Washington Post|author=Amanda Becker|date=3 May 2010|accessdate=23 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan Lovells has around 2,800 lawyers working in more than 40 offices in the United States, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia.

In 2013, Hogan Lovells was the eleventh largest law firm in the world by revenues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2013/12/11/hogan-lovells-taps-steve-immelt-as-firms-first-lone-ceo/|title=Hogan Lovells Taps Steve Immelt as Firm’s First Lone CEO|publisher=Wall Street Journal|author=Jennifer Smith|date=11 Dec 2013|accessdate=24 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; earning around US$1.8bn (£1.1bn) that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalweek.com/legal-week/news/1566229/lovells-enter-global-securing-hogan-merger-vote|title=Legal Week - Lovells to enter global top 10 after securing Hogan merger vote|work=legalweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2017, the firm had risen to 7th worldwide with gross revenues exceeding US$2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/the-2018-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/|title=The 2018 Am Law 100 Ranked by: Gross Revenue|publisher=The American Lawyer|author=Gina Passarella Cipriani|date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Hogan &amp; Hartson===
[[File:Hogan-hartson-logo.JPG|right|thumb|190px|The logo of Hogan &amp; Hartson prior to the Hogan Lovells merger]]
Hogan &amp; Hartson was founded by [[Frank J. Hogan]] in 1904. In 1925, Hogan was joined by Nelson T. Hartson, a former [[Internal Revenue Service]] attorney, and John William Buttson Guider. Hogan &amp; Hartson then went into partnership in 1938 with Buttson as a silent partner.

In 1970, Hogan &amp; Hartson became the first major firm to establish a separate practice group devoted exclusively to providing ''pro bono'' legal services. The Community Services Department (CSD) dealt with civil rights, environmental, homeless and other public interest groups. In 1990, Hogan &amp; Hartson opened an office in London, their first outside the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/howrey-v-hogan-hartson-a-timeline/|title=Howrey v. Hogan &amp; Hartson: A Timeline|publisher=The Washingtonian|author=Marisa M. Kashino|date=12 Dec 2011|accessdate=24 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the firm expanded to [[Tokyo]] and [[Berlin]] (after poaching a team from the former German ally of UK firm [[Linklaters]]). The firm expanded its presence in New York and Los Angeles in 2002 when it acquired mid-sized law firm [[Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent &amp; Sheinfeld]], a storied New York City-based practice with strengths in media, litigation and [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] law.&lt;ref&gt;'News in Brief,' ''The Lawyer,'' January 21, 2002. http://www.thelawyer.com/news-in-brief/102697.article.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the merger, ''Hogan &amp; Hartson'' was the oldest major law firm headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. It was a global firm with more than 1,100 lawyers in 27 offices worldwide, including offices in North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

===Lovells===
[[File:Lovells-Logo wikipedia.png|right|thumb|100px|The logo of Lovells prior to the Hogan Lovells merger]]
Lovells traced its history in the UK back to 1899, when John Lovell set up on his own account at Octavia Hill, between [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] and [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]].  He was later joined by Reginald White, a clerk in his previous firm, to whom he gave articles.  In 1924, they were joined by Charles King, forming Lovell, White &amp; King.  Soon after formation, the firm moved to Thavies Inn at [[Holborn Circus]] and later to [[Serjeant's Inn]], [[Fleet Street]], before moving to 21 [[Holborn Viaduct]] in October 1977.

Lovells was formed as a result of a number of earlier mergers. In 1966, Lovell, White &amp; King merged with Haslewoods, a firm with a much longer history of private client work. Haslewoods diverse clients included the [[Treasury Solicitor]].  In 1988, Lovell, White &amp; King, which by then had a large international commercial practice, merged with Durrant Piesse, known, in particular, for its specialism in banking and financial services, forming Lovell White Durrant.  It then changed to Lovells in 2000 when the firm merged with German law firm Boesebeck Droste.  Other mergers then followed in other European countries during the early 2000s (decade).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lovells.com/Lovells/AboutLovells/OurHistory/history.htm|title=Global Lawyers - International Law Firm - Hogan Lovells|work=lovells.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s Lovells invested strongly in China, expanding is office in [[Beijing]] and opening an office in [[Shanghai]] becoming the second largest foreign firm in China.  Following five years of growth, culminating in the opening of the firm's [[Madrid]] office in 2004, Lovells had a presence in every major European [[jurisdiction]]. In 2007, Lovells opened an office in [[Dubai]], offering legal services to corporations, financial institutions and individuals in the [[Middle East]] and at the beginning of 2009 opened an office in Hanoi. In September 2009, Lovells opened an associated office in Riyadh.

At the time of the merger, ''Lovells'' was a [[London]]-based international [[law firm]] with over 300 [[partnership|partner]]s and around 3,150 employees operating from 26 offices in [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the United States.

===Hogan Lovells===

In December 2011 it was reported that Hogan Lovells would be moving to a single chairman model following the retirement of John Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelawyer.com/hogan-lovells-to-move-to-single-chairman-as-co-incumbent-retires/1010478.article|title=Hogan Lovells to move to single chairman as co-incumbent retires|accessdate=18 December 2011|publisher=The Lawyer|date=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Hogan Lovells merged with South African firm Routledge Modise. The addition of about 120 lawyers in the Johannesburg office make up the first physical location for Hogan Lovells in Africa although the firm maintains a presence in Francophone Africa through its Paris office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-20/hogan-lovells-to-open-in-south-africa-business-of-law.html|title=Hogan Lovells to Open in South Africa: Business of Law |publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|author=Elizabeth Amon|date=20 Nov 2013|accessdate=27 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kenworth.jpg|thumb|The hours of service limit the driving hours of [[truck driver]]s and [[bus driver]]s.]]

'''Hours of Service''' ('''HOS''') regulations are issued by the [[Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration]] (FMCSA) and govern the working hours of anyone operating a [[commercial motor vehicle]] (CMV) in the [[United States]]. These regulations apply to [[truck driver]]s, commercial and city [[bus driver]]s, and [[school bus]] drivers who operate CMVs. These rules limit the number of daily and weekly hours spent driving and working, and regulate the minimum amount of time drivers must spend resting between driving shifts. For [[wiktionary:intrastate|intrastate]] commerce, the respective state's regulations apply.

The FMCSA is a division of the [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT), which is generally responsible for enforcement of FMCSA regulations. The driver of a CMV is required to keep a record of working hours using a [[#Log book|log book]], outlining the total number of hours spent driving and resting, as well as the time at which the change of duty status occurred. In lieu of a log book, a motor carrier may keep track of a driver's hours using [[Electronic Logging Devices]] (ELDs), which automatically record the amount of time spent driving the vehicle.

The HOS's main purpose is to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue. This is accomplished by limiting the number of driving hours per day, and the number of driving and working hours per week. Fatigue is also prevented by keeping drivers on a 21- to 24-hour schedule, maintaining a natural sleep/wake cycle (or [[circadian rhythm]]). Drivers are required to take a daily minimum period of rest, and are allowed longer "weekend" rest periods to combat cumulative fatigue effects that accrue on a weekly basis.

Enforcement of the HOS is generally handled by DOT officers of each state, and are sometimes checked when CMVs pass through [[weigh station]]s. Drivers found to be in violation of the HOS can be forced to stop driving for a certain period of time, which may negatively affect the [[motor carrier safety rating|motor carrier's safety rating]]. Requests to change the HOS are a source of contentious debate, and many surveys indicate some drivers get away with routinely violating the HOS. These facts have started another debate on whether motor carriers should be required to use ELDs in their vehicles, instead of relying on paper-based log books.

==Purpose==
[[Image:Hours of service FMCSA study.svg|thumb|300px|A graph outlining the relationship between number of hours driven and the percent of crashes related to driver fatigue.&lt;br&gt;Source: [[Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration]]&lt;ref name=graph&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/topics/hos/regulatory-impact-analysis.htm |title=Regulatory Impact and Small Business Analysis for Hours of Service Options |accessdate=2008-02-22 |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126005807/http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/topics/hos/regulatory-impact-analysis.htm |archivedate=2008-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Drivers subject to the HOS include any driver of a vehicle which has a [[gross vehicle weight]] of {{convert|10001|lb}} or more; which is designed or used to transport more than 8&amp;nbsp;passengers (including the driver) for compensation; which is designed or used to transport more than 15&amp;nbsp;passengers (including the driver) and is not used to transport passengers for compensation; or which is used to transport [[hazardous materials]] in quantities requiring the vehicle to be marked or [[placard]]ed under the hazardous materials regulations.&lt;ref name="FMCSA"/&gt;

The purpose of the HOS is to reduce accidents caused by driver [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].  As the graph to the right illustrates, the number of hours spent driving has a strong correlation to the number of fatigue-related accidents. According to numerous studies, the risk of fatigue is also greatest between the hours of midnight and six in the morning, and increases with the total length of the driver's trip.&lt;ref name="FMCSA"/&gt;

The FMCSA identifies three main factors in driver fatigue: [[Circadian rhythm]] effects, [[sleep deprivation]] and cumulative fatigue effects, and industrial or "time-on-task" fatigue.

Circadian rhythm effects describe the tendency for humans to experience a normal cycle in attentiveness and sleepiness through the 24-hour day. Those with a conventional sleep pattern (sleeping for seven or eight&amp;nbsp;hours at night) experience periods of maximum fatigue in the early hours of the morning and a lesser period in the early afternoon. During the low points of this cycle, one experiences reduced attentiveness. During the high points, it is difficult to sleep soundly. The cycle is anchored in part by ambient lighting (darkness causes a person's body to release the hormone [[melatonin]], which induces sleep),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/melatonin-000315.htm |title=Melatonin |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by a person's imposed pattern of regular sleeping and waking times. The influence of the day-night cycle is never fully displaced (standard artificial lighting is not strong enough to inhibit the release of melatonin),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/465494_25 |title=Pathophysiology and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders |accessdate=2008-04-24 |author=Czeisler, Charles A |publisher=Medscape |work=Insomnia and Beyond: The Neurochemical Basis for Targeted Sleep Therapeutics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the performance of night shift workers usually suffers. Circadian rhythms are persistent, and can only be shifted by one to two&amp;nbsp;hours forward or backward per day. Changing the starting time of a work shift by more than these amounts will reduce attentiveness, which is common after the first night shift following a "weekend" break during which conventional sleep times were followed.&lt;ref name=graph/&gt;

Sleep deprivation and cumulative fatigue effects describe how individuals who fail to have an adequate period of sleep (7&amp;ndash;8&amp;nbsp;hours in 24&amp;nbsp;hours) or who have been awake longer than the conventional 16&amp;ndash;17&amp;nbsp;hours will suffer sleep deprivation. A sleep deficit accumulates with successive sleep-deprived days, and additional fatigue may be caused by breaking daily sleep into two shorter periods in place of a single unbroken period of sleep. A sleep deficit is not instantly reduced by one night's sleep; it may take two or three conventional sleep cycles for an individual to return to unimpaired performance.&lt;ref name=graph/&gt;

Industrial or "time-on-task" fatigue describes fatigue that is accumulated during the working period, and affects performance at different times during the shift. Performance declines the longer a person is engaged in a task, gradually during the first few hours and more steeply toward the end of a long period at work. Reduced performance has also been observed in the first hour of work as an individual adjusts to the working environment.&lt;ref name=graph/&gt;

==Definition of terms==

Parts of a driver's work day are defined in four terms: On-duty time, off-duty time, driving time, and [[Berth (sleeping)|sleeper berth]] time.

FMCSA regulation [[§]]395.2 states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&amp;ty=HTML&amp;h=L&amp;mc=true&amp;=PART&amp;n=pt49.5.395#se49.5.395_12 |title=§395.2 Definitions |accessdate=2008-01-31 |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''On-duty''' time is all time from when a driver begins to work or is required to be in readiness to work until the driver is relieved from work and all responsibility for performing work.

:On-duty time includes:

* All time at a plant, terminal, facility, or other property of a motor carrier or shipper, or on any public property, waiting to be dispatched, unless the driver has been relieved from duty by the motor carrier.
* All time inspecting, servicing, or conditioning any CMV at any time.
* Crossing a border
* All driving time as defined in the term "driving time".
* All time, other than driving time, in or upon any CMV except time spent resting in a sleeper berth.
* All time loading or unloading a CMV, supervising, or assisting in the loading or unloading, attending a CMV being loaded or unloaded, remaining in readiness to operate the CMV, or in giving or receiving receipts for shipments loaded or unloaded.
* All time repairing, obtaining assistance, or remaining in attendance upon a disabled CMV.
* All time spent providing a breath sample or urine specimen, including travel time to and from the collection site, to comply with the random, reasonable suspicion, post-accident, or follow-up [[drug test]]ing.
* Performing any other work in the capacity, employ, or service of a motor carrier.
* Performing any compensated work for a person who is not a motor carrier. (This rule does not explicitly forbid a driver from obtaining a second or part-time job. It simply prevents a driver switching from a non-driving job to a driving job without the required 10&amp;nbsp;hours of rest.)

'''Driving''' time is all time spent at the driving controls of a CMV.
[[Image:VOLVO.jpg|thumb|The [[Berth (sleeping)|''sleeper berth'']] is the area toward the rear of the truck cab (with the dark tinted windows).]]
'''Sleeper berth''' time is any amount of time spent inside the sleeper berth (e.g., resting or sleeping). FMCSA regulation §393.76 gives the minimum requirements for a space to be defined as a sleeper berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?section=393.76#49CFR393.76 |title=§393.76 Sleeper berths |accessdate=2008-01-31 |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221132109/http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?section=393.76#49CFR393.76 |archivedate=2008-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The simple definition is an area separate from (usually immediately behind) the driving controls that includes a bed. The rules do not explicitly require that a driver must sleep, only that a driver must take a period of "rest" within the sleeper berth or off-duty (i.e., home). A statement made by the ICC in 1937 gives the reason: "We have no control over the manner in which a driver may spend his time off-duty, although some of his spare time activities may tire him as much as any work would do. We can only emphasize, by this comment, the responsibility which is the driver's own to assure himself of adequate rest and sleep, in the time available for this purpose, to ensure safety of his driving, and likewise the employer's responsibility to see that his drivers report for work in fit condition."&lt;ref name="FMCSA"/&gt;

'''Off-duty''' time is any time not spent on-duty, driving, or in the sleeper berth.

In 1938, the now-abolished [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC) enforced the first HOS rules.&lt;ref name="FMCSA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hours of Service of Drivers; Driver Rest and Sleep for Safe Operations; Proposed Rule |date=May 2, 2000 |author=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration|journal=Federal Register|volume=65|issue=85|pages=25541–25611}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drivers were limited to 12&amp;nbsp;hours of work within a 15-hour period. Work was defined as ''loading, unloading, driving, handling freight, preparing reports, preparing vehicles for service, or performing any other duty pertaining to the transportation of passengers or property.''&lt;ref name="FMCSA"/&gt; The ICC intended the 3-hour difference between 15&amp;nbsp;hours on-duty and 12&amp;nbsp;hours of work to be used for meals and rest breaks. The weekly maximum was limited to 60&amp;nbsp;hours over 7&amp;nbsp;days (non-daily drivers), or 70&amp;nbsp;hours over 8&amp;nbsp;days (daily drivers). These rules allowed for 12&amp;nbsp;hours of work within a 15-hour period, 9&amp;nbsp;hours of rest, with 3&amp;nbsp;hours for breaks within a 24-hour day.

Within a short time, however, representatives of [[organized labor]] (including the [[American Federation of Labor]], the [[Teamsters]], and the [[International Association of Machinists]]) petitioned for a stay of the original regulations. A few motor carriers made a similar request. The ICC agreed, and oral arguments were heard again. Labor wanted HOS limits of 8&amp;nbsp;hours per day and 48&amp;nbsp;hours per week. The ICC commented "there was no statistical or other information which would enable [them] to say definitely how long a driver can safely work."&lt;ref name="FMCSA"/&gt;

{{quote|1=The evidence before us clearly does not suffice to enable us to conclude that a duty period as low as 8&amp;nbsp;hours in 24 is required in the interest of safety. We may call attention, as did the division, to the contrast between factory operations, generally sustained in character, and the operation of buses and trucks, generally characterized by frequent stops ... because of conditions encountered in highway and street traffic. The monotony or nervous and physical strain of driving such vehicles is alleviated by these breaks in the periods devoted to driving, and the period of actual work is considerably below the period on-duty.|4=Interstate Commerce Commission|5=July 12, 1938&lt;ref name="FMCSA"/&gt;}}

Within six months of the original ruling, the ICC ultimately decided to change the 12-hour ''work'' limit in 24&amp;nbsp;hours to a 10-hour ''driving'' limit in 24&amp;nbsp;hours, and the 15-hour on-duty limit was rescinded. Motor carriers were required to give drivers 8, rather than 9, consecutive hours off-duty each day.&lt;ref name="FMCSA"/&gt; These rules allowed for 10&amp;nbsp;hours of driving and 8&amp;nbsp;hours of rest within a 24-hour day.

In 1962, for reasons it never clearly explained, the ICC eliminated the 24-hour cycle rule,&lt;ref name="FMCSA"/&gt; and reinstated the 15-hour on-duty limit.&lt;ref name=iihs&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iihs.org/externaldata/srdata/docs/sr3206.pdf |work=Status Report |title=Special issue: truck driver fatigue |accessdate=2014-12-09 |publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |format=PDF |date=July 26, 1997 |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=1–8 |issn=0018-988X |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701095743/http://www.iihs.org/externaldata/srdata/docs/sr3206.pdf |archivedate=July 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With 10&amp;nbsp;hours of driving and 8&amp;nbsp;hours of sleep, drivers were allowed to maintain an 18-hour cycle, disrupting the driver's natural 24-hour circadian rhythm. This change allowed up to 16&amp;nbsp;hours of driving per day, allowing the driver to exhaust their weekly limits in as little as five&amp;nbsp;days. Later, an added exception for trucks equipped with sleeper berths meant drivers were allowed to "split" their 8-hour off-duty time into two parts. With the new splitting provision, a driver could take two 4-hour periods of rest. Using one of these short rest periods would effectively "stop the on-duty clock", allowing the driver to split the 15-hour on-duty time limit into two parts as well. These rules allowed for 10&amp;nbsp;hours of work within a 15-hour time limit, and 8&amp;nbsp;hours of rest within an 18-hour day.&lt;ref name="FMCSA"/&gt;

Between 1962 and 2003, there were numerous proposals to change the HOS again, but none were ever finalized. By this time, the ICC had been abolished, and regulations were now issued by the FMCSA. The 2003 changes applied only to property-carrying drivers (i.e., truck drivers). These rules allowed 11&amp;nbsp;hours of driving within a 14-hour period, and required 10&amp;nbsp;hours of rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/rulemakings/final/05-16498-HOS-Final-Rule-8-25-05.htm |title=Hours of Service of Drivers |accessdate=2008-02-17 |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219114238/http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/rulemakings/final/05-16498-HOS-Final-Rule-8-25-05.htm |archivedate=2008-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes would allow drivers (using the entire 14-hour on-duty period) to maintain a natural 24-hour cycle, with a bare minimum 21-hour cycle (11&amp;nbsp;hours driving, 10&amp;nbsp;hours rest). However, the retention of the split sleeper berth provision would allow drivers to maintain irregular, short-burst sleeping schedules.

The most notable change of 2003 was the introduction of the "34-hour restart." Before the change, drivers could only gain more weekly driving hours with the passing of each day (which reduced their 70-hour total by the number of hours driven on the earliest day of the weekly cycle). After the change, drivers were allowed to "reset" their weekly 70-hour limit to zero, by taking 34 consecutive hours off-duty. This provision was introduced to combat the cumulative fatigue effects that accrue on a weekly basis, and to allow for two full nights of rest (e.g., during a weekend break).&lt;ref name="FMCSA"/&gt;

In 2005, the FMCSA changed the rules again, ''practically'' eliminating the split sleeper berth provision.&lt;ref name=new&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/topics/hos/HOS-2005.htm |title=Hours-of-Service Regulations - Effective October 1, 2005 |accessdate=2008-02-17 |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050907135839/http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/topics/hos/hos-2005.htm |archivedate=September 7, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drivers are now required to take a full 8&amp;nbsp;hours of rest, with 2&amp;nbsp;hours allowed for off-duty periods, for a total of 10&amp;nbsp;hours off-duty. This provision forced drivers to take one longer uninterrupted period of rest, but eliminated the flexibility of allowing drivers to take naps during the day without jeopardizing their driving time. Today's rule still allows them to "split" the sleeper berth period, but one of the splits must be 8&amp;nbsp;hours long and the remaining 2&amp;nbsp;hours do not stop the 14-hour on-duty period. This rule is confusing and impractical for most drivers, resulting in the majority of drivers taking the full 10-hour break.&lt;ref name=ooida3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/laws/comments/pdf/comment_fmcsa_2008-03-06.pdf |title=Work Schedules of Long-Distance Truck Drivers Before and After 2004 Hours-of-Service Rule Change |accessdate=2008-05-11 |publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |format=PDF |author=McCartt, Annie T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years since 2005, groups such as [[Public Citizen Litigation Group]], Parents Against Tired Truckers (PATT), [[Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association]] (OOIDA), Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways (CRASH, which has merged with PATT), and the [[American Trucking Associations]] (ATA), have been working to change the HOS again.&lt;ref name=ooida3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ooida.com/Documents/Press_Releases/OOIDA_petitions_HOS_rules.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016043022/http://www.ooida.com/Documents/Press_Releases/OOIDA_petitions_HOS_rules.html |archivedate=2006-10-16 |title=OOIDA petitions for changes to new HOS rule |accessdate=2008-05-10 |publisher=OOIDA |date=2005-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purchasing.com/article/CA6462913.html |title=Hours of service rules for truckers change again |accessdate=2008-02-17 |publisher=Reed Business Information |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225141611/http://www.purchasing.com/article/CA6462913.html |archivedate=2008-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heavydutytrucking.com/2003/06/046a0306.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306235103/http://www.heavydutytrucking.com/2003/06/046a0306.asp |archivedate=2005-03-06 |title=The Method Behind the Rule |accessdate=2008-05-10 |publisher=Heavy Duty Trucking |work=Volume 82, Number 6 |date=April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saferoads.org/HOSComments031708.pdf |title=Truck Driver Hours of Service |accessdate=2008-05-10 |publisher=Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety |format=PDF |date=2008-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513025658/http://www.saferoads.org/HOSComments031708.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each group has their own ideas about what should be changed, and different agendas on why the rules should be changed.

==Property-carrying vehicles==
[[Image:VOLVO TRUCK AUG 31 2007 WASHINGTON BLVD LOS ANGELES IMAGE PATRICE RAUNET HOLLYWOOD.jpg|thumb|A property-carrying vehicle]]

FMCSA rules prohibit driving a property-carrying CMV (e.g., trucks) more than 11&amp;nbsp;hours or to drive after having been on-duty for 14&amp;nbsp;hours. The 3-hour difference between the 11-hour driving limit and the 14-hour on-duty limit gives drivers the opportunity to take care of non-driving working duties such as loading and unloading cargo, fueling the vehicle, and required vehicle inspections, as well as non-working duties such as meal and rest breaks. After completing an 11- to 14-hour on-duty period, the driver must be allowed 10&amp;nbsp;hours off-duty.&lt;ref name=prop&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?rule_toc=764&amp;section=395.3&amp;section_toc=1940 |title=§395.3 Maximum driving time for property-carrying vehicles |accessdate=2008-01-31 |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207053117/http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?rule_toc=764&amp;section=395.3&amp;section_toc=1940 |archivedate=2008-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FMCSA rules prohibit drivers from operating a CMV after having been on-duty 60&amp;nbsp;hours in 7 consecutive days (if the motor carrier does not operate CMVs every day of the week), or after having been on-duty 70&amp;nbsp;hours in 8 consecutive days (if the motor carrier operates CMVs every day of the week).&lt;ref name=prop/&gt;

After accumulating, for example, 70&amp;nbsp;hours of driving and on-duty time within a period of 8&amp;nbsp;days, a driver's daily driving limit may be reduced (70 / 8 = 8.75 driving hours per day). A driver may be allowed (but not required) to take 34&amp;nbsp;hours off-duty to reset the weekly total back to zero (also known as a "34-hour restart").&lt;ref name=prop/&gt;

==Passenger-carrying vehicles==
[[Image:Cata hybrid.jpg|thumb|A passenger-carrying vehicle]]

FMCSA rules prohibit driving a passenger-carrying CMV (e.g., commercial and city [[buses]], passenger [[van]]s, and [[school buses]]) for more than 10&amp;nbsp;hours, or to drive after having been on-duty for 15&amp;nbsp;hours. The 5-hour difference between the 10-hour driving limit and the 15-hour on-duty limit gives drivers the opportunity to take care of non-driving work-related duties such as loading and unloading of passengers and luggage, and fueling the vehicle, as well as non-working duties such as meal and rest breaks. After completing a 10 to 15-hour on-duty period, the driver must be allowed 8&amp;nbsp;hours off-duty.&lt;ref name=pass&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?rule_toc=764&amp;section=395.5&amp;section_toc=121208 |title=§395.5 Maximum driving time for passenger-carrying vehicles |accessdate=2008-01-31 |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122165734/http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?rule_toc=764&amp;section=395.5&amp;section_toc=121208 |archivedate=2008-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FMCSA weekly hours limitations for passenger-carrying vehicles are identical to those for property-carrying vehicles.&lt;ref name=pass/&gt;

After accumulating, for example, 60&amp;nbsp;hours of driving and on-duty time within a period of 7&amp;nbsp;days, a driver's daily driving limit may be reduced (60 / 7 = 8.57 driving hours per day). The driver of a passenger-carrying vehicle may not use the 34-hour restart provision.&lt;ref name=new/&gt;

Drivers are required to make [[carbon copies]] of each page, so one page may be kept with the driver (to be produced upon inspection by DOT officers), and so the other copy may be sent to the driver's employer.&lt;ref name="logbook"/&gt;

[[Electronic Logging Devices]] can be thought of as an automated electronic log book. An ELD records the same information as a manual paper log book, and requires less input from the driver. The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving the driver responsible only for reporting on-duty and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper log book.&lt;ref name=NTSB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/speeches/rosenker/mvr070501.htm |title=Testimony of Mark V. Rosenker, Chairman, National Transportation Safety Board |accessdate=2008-03-16 |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FMCSA rules require that a log book (or ELD) must record for each change of duty status (e.g., the place of reporting for work, or starting to drive), the name of the [[city]], [[town]] or [[village]], with [[state abbreviation]]. If a change of duty status occurs at a location other than a city, the highway number and nearest milepost or the nearest two intersecting roadways followed by the name of the nearest city must be recorded. In addition to the time grid, a log book must record the date, total miles driven for the day, truck and trailer number, name of carrier, [[bill of lading]] number, and the driver's signature. The driver is required to retain a copy of each log page for the previous seven consecutive days which must be in his/her possession and available for inspection while on-duty.&lt;ref name="logbook"/&gt;

==Exceptions==
There are numerous exceptions to these rules, some of these include but are not limited to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?section=395.1# |title=§395.1 Scope of rules in this part |accessdate=2008-01-31 |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107092423/http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?section=395.1 |archivedate=2008-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During adverse [[weather]] or emergency driving conditions, drivers are permitted to exceed the 11 hour maximum daily driving time.  However, drivers may not extend the 14 hour on duty time.
* Drivers who venture less than a 150 air-mile radius from the work reporting location are not required to maintain log books (but are not exempt from limits on driving time), provided their employers maintain accurate records of their driving time.
* Drivers who start and stop their work day at the same location for at least the previous 5 work days may drive past the 14 hour mark, for an extra 2 hours, if 11 driving hours are not exceeded.  The 16-hour rule extends the work day by two hours, but does not extend the allowable driving hours.  The 16-hour rule may be invoked once per 34 hour reset, if the 5 day pattern has been established. The driver must be relieved from work after the 16th hour.
* Drivers for [[List of oilfield service companies|oilfield operations]] in the [[petroleum industry]], [[groundwater]] [[drilling rig|drilling]] operations, [[construction]] materials, and [[public utility|utility]] service vehicles are permitted to take a 24-hour restart.
* [[Retail]] store drivers who venture less than a 100 air-mile (115.08 statute miles or 185.2 kilometers) radius are allowed to exceed daily driving limits to make store deliveries from December 10 to December 25, due to the demands of the [[Christmas]] [[Christmas and holiday season|shopping season]].
* Drivers in [[Alaska]] can drive up to 15&amp;nbsp;hours within a 20-hour period.
* Drivers in [[Hawaii]] are not required to maintain log books, provided their employers keep accurate records of their driving time.
*Drivers in [[California]] are allowed up to 12 driving hours and 16 on duty hours.
* Drivers for theatrical or television motion picture productions are exempt if the driver operates within a 100 air-mile radius of the location where the driver reports to and is released from work. These drivers may take an 8-hour break, and are allowed 15 hours on duty.

==Enforcement==

The HOS are issued, among other industry-related regulations, by the FMCSA. In this instance, federal regulations apply only to interstate commerce. Commerce which does not involve the crossing of state lines is considered intrastate, and is under the jurisdiction of the respective state's laws. However, most states have adopted intrastate regulations which are identical or very similar to the federal HOS regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/truck/driver/hos/hos-faqs.asp#_Toc111021227 |title=HOS Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |accessdate=2008-02-24 |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration |work=B-1.

Enforcement of the HOS rules is generally handled by DOT officers of their respective states, although any ordinary police officer may inspect a driver's log book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0DF1F30F930A25753C1A96F948260 |title=Inspectors Tripping Up Truck Drivers |accessdate=2008-05-12 |publisher=New York Times |author=James, George |date=1989-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; States are responsible for maintaining [[weigh station]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question626.htm |title=How do truck weigh stations work? |accessdate=2008-03-08 |publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly located at the borders between states, where drivers are pulled in for random vehicle inspections (although some of the inspections are based on the [[motor carrier safety rating|motor carrier's safety rating]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://safer.fmcsa.dot.gov/about.aspx |title=About SAFER |accessdate=2008-02-25 |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, a driver may be pulled over for random checks by police officers or DOT officials at any time. Drivers are required to maintain their log books to current status, and if inspections reveal any sort of discrepancy, drivers may be put "out of service" until the driver has accumulated enough off-duty time to be back in compliance.&lt;ref name=vio/&gt; Being put out of service means a driver may not drive his truck during the prescribed limit under risk of further penalty. Repeated violations can result in fines from $1,000 to $11,000 and a downgrade in the motor carrier's safety rating.&lt;ref name=vio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/truck/driver/hos/hos-faqs.asp#_Toc111021228 |title=HOS Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |accessdate=2008-02-24 |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration |work=B-2.

These same drivers reported they would log these times as on-duty if they were paid reasonably for such delays.&lt;ref name="FMCSA"/&gt;

Drivers can get away with this rule-breaking due to their paper-based log books.&lt;ref name=mjs/&gt; As drivers record their time spent behind the wheel, there is very little to stop them from forging their log books.&lt;ref name=cdc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2007-120/ |title=Truck Driver Occupational Safety and Health |accessdate=2008-05-10 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |author=Saltzman, Gregory M |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is very superficial oversight and some drivers take advantage of this fact. Surveys indicate that between 25% and 75% of drivers violate the HOS.&lt;ref name="FMCSA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/laws/comments/pdf/comment_fmsca_atm_041807.pdf |title=Electronic On-Board Recorders for Hours-of-Service Compliance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking; Docket No. FMCSA-2004-18940 |accessdate=2008-02-26 |publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other drivers maintain more than one log book, showing falsified versions to enforcement officers.&lt;ref name=NTSB/&gt;

Trucking companies (motor carriers) can also play a role in HOS violations.&lt;ref name=cdc/&gt; Certain carriers may choose to knowingly ignore HOS violations made by their drivers, or even encourage their drivers to do so. Allowing drivers to violate the HOS is an effective cost-cutting measure used mostly by non-union, long haul carriers. Permitting HOS violations allows a carrier to hire fewer drivers, and run on fewer trucks than a company which follows the rules. To comply with the HOS, these companies would have to hire more drivers (possibly driving up wages) and purchase additional trucks and trailers. Making a change to comply with the law is complicated by competition with carriers that already comply with HOS regulations. Due to this competition, carriers who choose to switch from non-compliance could not pass on all of their increased costs associated with HOS compliance to their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/93740286_3.html |title=The case for strengthened motor carrier hours of service regulations. |accessdate=2008-04-26 |publisher=Entrepreneur.com |work=Transportation Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, two trucking company officials were sentenced to [[federal prison]] for violating hours of service regulations. Charles Georgoulakos Jr. and his brother, James Georgoulakos were sentenced to four months in prison, eight months in [[home confinement]], and one year of [[supervised release]]. Their company, C&amp;J Trucking Company of [[Londonderry, New Hampshire]], was placed on two years probation and fined $25,000 (the maximum amount). The sentences were the result of an investigation which began when one of the trucking company's drivers was involved in a collision on [[Interstate 93]] in Londonderry on Aug. 2, 1995, in which four individuals were killed.&lt;ref name="cnj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.gov/affairs/1999/fhwa3899.htm |title=FHWA Announces Maximum Penalties For Truckers Violating Safety Regulations |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Transportation]] |accessdate=2009-03-19 |date=June 7, 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923041908/http://www.dot.gov/affairs/1999/fhwa3899.htm |archivedate=2006-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several private and public motor carriers such as [[Frito-Lay]],&lt;ref name=iihs/&gt; [[United Parcel Service]],&lt;ref name=iihs/&gt; and [[Werner Enterprises]], have voluntarily implemented electronic on-board recorders to ensure drivers are in compliance with the federal regulations, to reduce the errors and hassles associated with paper log books, and to improve driver retention and recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.werner.com/content/res/drv/paperless/faq/ |title=Paperless Log System FAQ |accessdate=2008-03-08 |publisher=Werner Enterprises |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216195707/http://www.werner.com/content/res/drv/paperless/faq/ |archivedate=2008-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; EOBRs automatically record the driving time and cannot be easily forged.

==Rewriting the Hours of Service==

Whereas the 11 and 14 hour rules are still in effect, drivers will also be required to take a 30-minute break after 8 hours of on duty time.  The 34 hour restart provision will still be in effect.  However, drivers will only be allowed 1 restart per week (168 hours).
Up to 2 hours either side of a sleeper-berth period while in the passenger seat will count as off-duty. Drivers inside a parked CMV who are not in the sleeper berth must log it as on-duty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/truck/driver/hos/hos-faqs.asp#_Toc111021232 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221073332/http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/truck/driver/hos/hos-faqs.asp |date=2008-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This regulation has been codified into the Final Rule,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/topics/hos-final/hos-final-rule.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and will come into force on the 27th February 2013 (for the additional Off Duty allowances) and 1 July 2013 (for the break rules, and restart limits).

'''HOS Final Rule''' 
On December 27, 2011 (76 FR 81133), FMCSA published a final rule amending its hours-of-service (HOS) regulations for drivers of property-carrying commercial motor vehicles (CMVs). The final rule adopted several changes to the HOS regulations, including a new provision requiring drivers to take a rest break during the work day under certain circumstances. Drivers may drive a CMV only if 8 hours or less have passed since the end of the driver's last off-duty or sleeper-berth period of at least 30 minutes. FMCSA did not specify when drivers must take the 30-minute break, but the rule requires that they wait no longer than 8 hours after the last off-duty or sleeper-berth period of that length or longer to take the break. Drivers who already take shorter breaks during the work day could comply with the rule by taking one of the shorter breaks and extending it to 30 minutes. The new requirement took effect on July 1, 2013.

On August 2, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued its ruling on the Hours of Service litigation brought by the American Trucking Associations and Public Citizen. The Court upheld the 2011 Hours of Service regulations in all aspects except for the 30-minute break provision as it applies to short haul drivers. While the decision does not officially take effect until the mandate is issued 52 days after the decision (unless a party files a petition for rehearing, either by the panel or en banc, or moves to stay the mandate pending the filing of a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court), FMCSA announces the Agency will immediately cease enforcement of the 30-minute rest break provision of the HOS rule against short-haul operations. 
The Agency requests that its State enforcement partners also cease enforcement of this provision. States that do so will not be found in violation of the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP). 
ENFORCEMENT POLICY 
Effective August 2, 2013, FMCSA will no longer enforce 49 CFR 395.3(a)(3)(ii) against any driver that qualifies for either of the "short haul operations" exceptions outlined in 49 CFR 395.1(e)(1) or (2). The Agency requests that State and local enforcement agencies also refrain from enforcing the 30-minute rest break against these drivers. Specifically, the following drivers would not be subject to the 30-minute break requirement: 
* All drivers (CDL and non-CDL) that operate within 150 air-miles of their normal work reporting location and satisfy the time limitations and record keeping requirements of 395.1(e)(1).
* Non-CDL drivers that operate within a 150 air-mile radius of the location where the driver reports for duty and satisfy the time limitations and record keeping requirements of 395.1

The '''Indian Child Welfare Act''' of 1978 ('''ICWA''') (({{USStatute|95|608|92|3069|1978|11|08}}), codified at {{usc|25|1901|1963}}&lt;ref name=ICWA&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, ({{USStatute|95|608|92|3069|1978|11|08}}, {{usc|25|1901|1963}})&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Federal law that governs jurisdiction over the removal of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] (Indian) children from their families.

==Overview of ICWA==

===General===
ICWA gives tribal governments a strong voice concerning [[child custody]] proceedings that involve Indian children, by allocating tribes [[exclusive jurisdiction]] over the case when the child resides on, or is domiciled on, the reservation, or when the child is a [[Ward (law)|ward]] of the tribe; and [[concurrent jurisdiction|concurrent]], but presumptive, jurisdiction over non-reservation Native Americans' foster care placement proceedings.&lt;ref name=ICWA1911&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, {{usc|25|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
ICWA was enacted in 1978 because of the disproportionately high rate of forced removal of Indian children from their traditional homes and essentially from American Indian cultures as a whole. Before enactment, as many as 25 to 35 percent of all Indian children were being forcibly removed, mostly from intact American Indian families, and placed in non-Indian homes, with a deliberate absence of American Indian cultures.&lt;ref name=JohnsonWSR&gt;Johnson, Troy R. (1999), "The State and the American Indian: Who Gets the Indian Child?," 14 ''Wicazo Sa R.'' 197 (University of Minnesota Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JonesABA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abanet.org/genpractice/magazine/1995/fall/indianchildwelfareact.html |title=The Indian Child Welfare Act: The need for a separate law |author=Jones, B.J. |year=1995 |work=General Practice, Solo &amp; Small Firm Division |publisher=American Bar Association |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) paid the states to remove Indian children and to place them with non-Indian families and religious groups.&lt;ref name=Lowe352&gt;Lowe, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;  Testimony in the [[United States House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs|House Committee for Interior and Insular Affairs]] showed that in some cases, the per capita rate of Indian children in foster care was nearly 16 times higher than the rate for non-Indians.&lt;ref name=HouseRpt&gt;H. Rep. No. 95-608, 95th Cong., 2d. Sess. (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 7530, 1978 CIS H443-53&lt;/ref&gt;  If Indian children had continued to be removed from Indian homes at this rate, tribal survival would be threatened. It also damaged the emotional lives of many children, as adults having been through the process testified. Congress recognized this, and stated that the interests of tribal stability were as important as the best interests of the child.&lt;ref name=Josephy124&gt;Josephy, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; One of the factors in this judgment was that, because of the differences in culture, what was in the best interest of a non-Indian child was not necessarily what was in the best interest of an Indian child, especially as they have traditionally larger extended families and tribal relationships in their culture.&lt;ref name=JonesTilden12&gt;Jones, ''The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook,'' p.12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Louis La Rose ([[Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska]]) testified:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think the cruelest trick that the white man has ever done to Indian children is to take them into adoption court, erase all of their records and send them off to some nebulous family ... residing in a white community and he goes back to the reservation and he has absolutely no idea who his relatives are, and they effectively make him a non-person and I think ... they destroy him.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson258&gt;Wilkinson, p. 258-260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Congress recognized that four primary factors contributed to the high rates of Indian child removal. These were 1) "a lack of culturally competent State child-welfare standards for assessing the fitness of Indian families; 2) systematic due-process violations against both Indian children and their parents during child-custody procedures; 3) economic incentives favoring removal of Indian children from their families and communities; 4) and social conditions in Indian country." &lt;ref&gt;81 Fed. Reg. 38780 (June 14, 2016)_&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other groups have also had stakes in these decisions. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) had an [[Indian Placement Program]] that removed Indian children from their tribes and into church members homes.  By the 1970s, approximately 5,000 Indian children were living in Mormon homes.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson258 /&gt;  The lack of knowledge about American Indian culture by most social workers also contributed to the high removal rates.  Most social workers are conditioned by the "[[Best interests|best interest of the child]]" as outlined by ''Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (Second Edition),'' which advocates bonding with at least one adult as a parent figure.&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;Goldstein, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; This did not take into consideration the tribal culture of the extended tribal family, in which children could have close relationships with extended family.  Common American Indian practices of having a child cared for by an extended relative was viewed as abandonment by allegedly well-intentioned but arguably paternalistic social workers. But tribal members considered this normal behavior and a desirable way to ensure the child was cared for by family.&lt;ref name=JonesTilden3&gt;Jones, ''The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook,'' p.3-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

During congressional consideration, held at the request of Native American advocacy groups, opposition was raised by several states, the LDS Church, and several social welfare groups.  The bill was pushed through by Representative [[Morris Udall]] of [[Arizona]], who lobbied President [[Jimmy Carter]] to sign the bill.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson258 /&gt; It was strongly supported by Senator [[James Abourezk]] of South Dakota, who had authored the bill and previously contributed to founding the American Indian Policy Review Commission and the [[Select Committee on Indian Affairs]], each of which he chaired.&lt;ref name="abourezk"&gt;[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/08/war-words-icwa-faces-multiple-assaults-adoption-industry-160993 Suzette Brewer, "War of Words: ICWA Faces Multiple Assaults From Adoption Industry"], ''Indian Country Today'', 8 July 2015; accessed 9 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress's overriding purpose in passing the ICWA was to protect Indian culture and tribal integrity from the unnecessary removal of Indian children by state and federal agencies.  Awareness of the issues facing American Indian children came about from the advocacy and research by the [[Association on American Indian Affairs]].  Congress reasoned that "there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children."&lt;ref name=ICWA1902&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, {{usc|25|1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal challenge====
In October 2018, Federal District Court Judge [[Reed Charles O'Connor|Reed O'Connor]] struck down parts of the law as unconstitutional due to it mandating racial preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/federal_court_declares_indian_child_welfare_act_unconstitutional|title=Federal court in Texas declares Indian Child Welfare Act unconstitutional|first=Lorelei|last=Laird|date=October 10, 2018|work=[[ABA Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jurisdiction===

====Minimum Standards====
ICWA sets the minimal Federal standards for nearly all Indian child custody proceedings, including adoption, voluntary and involuntary termination of parental rights, and removal and foster care placement of Indian children, but excluding divorce and child delinquency proceedings.  ICWA provides that state courts have no jurisdiction over the adoption or custody of Indian children residing within their own tribal reservation.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; An "Indian child" is "any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe."&lt;ref name=ICWA1903&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, {{usc|25|1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICWA applies to a "child custody proceeding"&lt;ref name=ICWA1903 /&gt; involving an Indian child.  The term "child custody proceeding" involves: (i) "foster care placements", where the child has been placed in a foster home, and the parent cannot have the child returned upon demand, but where parental rights have not been terminated; (2) terminations of parental rights; (3) "preadoptive placements", which means placing the child in a foster home after the termination of parental rights, but before or instead of an adoption; and (4) adoptions.&lt;ref name=ICWA1903 /&gt;

ICWA does not cover child custody hearings during divorce proceedings. Nor does ICWA cover cases of child delinquency where the child has done something that would be considered a crime if done by an adult.  Because Indian tribes play a major part in the upbringing of Indian children that is significantly different than that of the parents, the ICWA gives important jurisdictional powers to Indian tribes in order to preserve the Indian culture.  Tribal courts hold either [[exclusive jurisdiction]] or [[concurrent jurisdiction]] dependent on several factors.&lt;ref name=ICWA1911 /&gt;

====Exclusive tribal jurisdiction====
Under ICWA, an Indian tribe has exclusive jurisdiction over an Indian child who resides or is domiciled within the tribe's land.  This includes both reservation land, other tribal lands that are held in trust by the Federal government for the benefit of a tribe or individual, or held by a tribe or individual subject to a restriction by the United States against alienation.  The last two describe tribal lands such as those in [[Oklahoma]] that were transferred to individual Indians under various laws.  The Indian tribal courts also have exclusive jurisdiction over Indian children who are wards of the court or tribe, regardless of their location.&lt;ref name=ICWA1903 /&gt;

The first [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case dealing with ICWA was the 1989 case  ''[[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield]]'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=490&amp;page=30 (490 U.S. 30, 109 S.Ct. 1597)].   This Court ruled that the ICWA gives the tribal court [[exclusive jurisdiction]] over a case where the parent was domiciled on the reservation, no matter what their own personal desires are in the custody case.

====Concurrent jurisdiction====
Concurrent jurisdiction is shared jurisdiction between the tribal courts and the state courts. State courts have been severely criticized for ignoring the requirements of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. McCarthy, The Indian Child Welfare Act: In the Best Interests of the Child and Tribe, 27/8 CLEARINGHOUSE REVIEW 864 (December 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases that the tribal court does not have exclusive jurisdiction, they have concurrent jurisdiction.  These cases would be custody proceedings involving Indian children that don't reside or are not domiciled on the tribal lands (such as someone born off the reservation and whose parents don't live on the reservation). In these concurrent decisions, the ICWA expresses a preference for tribal jurisdiction in Indian child custody proceedings.&lt;ref name=ICWA1903 /&gt;

==Procedures==
[[File:Native American boy in Men's Northern Traditional outfit.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Maintaining tribal relationships]]

===Notification and rights===
In an involuntary proceeding, the party seeking the placement of the child,&lt;ref name= 25CFR2311&gt;25 CFR §23.11(a) (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; which is often but not always the state, must notify both the parent(s) and/or Indian custodian(s) and the child's tribe at least 10 days prior to the proceeding. Emergency proceedings may follow state law, but proceedings after that are controlled by ICWA.  If the state cannot determine who the parent or the tribe is, then the state is required to notify the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]. Notification must contain all the requisite information identified in 25 CFR § 23.111 and be sent by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested,&lt;ref name= 25CFR2311 /&gt; and the parties notified have the right to an additional 20 days to prepare prior to the proceeding.&lt;ref name=ICWA1912&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, {{usc|25|1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Failure to provide such notice can cause a jurisdictional defect that may result in any such proceeding to be overturned.&lt;ref name=JonesTilden84&gt;{{cite book| title= The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook: A Legal Guide to the Custody and Adoption of Native American Children| first1= Billy Joe |last1= Jones| first2= Mark |last2= Tilden| first3= Kelly |last3= Gaines-Stoner| publisher= American Bar Association| year= 2008| edition= 2nd |pages= 84–88| isbn= 9781590318584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF365&gt;{{cite book| title= A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act| publisher= Native American Rights Fund| year= 2007| pages= 36–41| isbn= 9780979409912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Fort&gt;{{cite journal| last= Fort| first= Kathryn E.| year= 2008| title= Beyond Minimum Standards: Federal Requirements and State Interpretations of the Indian Child Welfare Act| volume= 45 |work= Court Review | number= 26 | publisher= American Judges Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICWA case may be dismissed for lack of due process if not for the lack of jurisdiction "because ' "failure to give proper notice of a dependency proceeding to a tribe with which the dependent child may be affiliated forecloses the participation by the tribe, [ICWA] notice requirements are strictly construed." ' ." &lt;ref&gt;In re Robert A., 147 Cal.App.4th 982, 989&lt;/ref&gt;

"The determination of a child's Indian status is up to the tribe; therefore, the juvenile court needs only a suggestion of Indian ancestry to trigger the notice requirement." &lt;ref&gt;In re Nikki R. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 844, 848&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The circumstances under which a juvenile court has reason to believe that a child is an Indian child is an in Indian child include, but are not limited to, the following: '(I) Any party to the case, Indian tribe, Indian organization or public or private agency informs the court that the child is an Indian child. (II) Any public or state-licensed agency involved in child protection services or family support has discovered information which suggests that the child is an Indian child. (III) The child who is the subject of the proceeding gives the court reason to believe he or she is an Indian child. (IV) The residence or domicile of the child, his or her biological parents, or the Indian custodian is known by the court to be or is shown to be a predominantly Indian community. (V) An officer of the court involved in the proceeding has knowledge that the child may be an Indian child.'|Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings (44 Federal Register 67584, 67586 (Nov. 26, 1979) (Guidelines); [former] rule 1439(d)(2).) &lt;ref&gt;In re O.K., 106 Cal.App.4th 152, 156&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians, a tribe that is federally recognized by the U.S. Federal Government but is not recognized for services of the Bureau of Indian Affairs under 25 C.F.R 83 et al. are used for precedent for many cases whereby the following conditions apply:

In cases whereby the mother may not be a member of the tribe, however she is eligible, then before the provisions of ICWA apply, "the trial court must initially determine if a child is an Indian child within the meaning of ICWA." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;In the Interest of C.H. et al., 510 N.W.2d 119, 123 (S.D. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; This is because "a parent's current enrollment is not always dispositive of a child's membership in an Indian tribe".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The finding in the case of the children involved was "In the matter of C.H. et al., 510 N.W.2d (S.D. 1993) that the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians were held to be a Federally Recognized tribe for the purposes of ICWA.

The child may be provided an attorney, and the parents are entitled to one if they are indigent and cannot afford one.  If the state does not have provisions for providing indigent parents an attorney, the Secretary of the Interior is to pay the attorney expenses.

All of the parties have the right to examine all documents and reports related to the proceeding.&lt;ref name=ICWA1912 /&gt;

In a removal case, the party seeking the removal (normally Child Protective Services or similar agency) is required to make active efforts to provide the parent or custodian with remedial and rehabilitative services designed to prevent the removal of the child from the Indian family.  The "active effort" requirement also applies even if the party seeking removal is a private party, as in a private party adoption.&lt;ref name=ICWA1912 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In the Matter of N.B. |vol= 199 |reporter= P.3d |opinion=16 |pinpoint=31 |court=Colo. App. |date=2007 |url= |quote=Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's holding that stepmother's failure to show active efforts as required by 25 U.S.C. § 1912(d) precludes termination of mother's parental rights through this stepparent adoption.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The child may not be temporarily removed unless there is a likelihood of "serious emotional or physical damage" to the child if they remain in the home.&lt;ref name=ICWA1916&gt;Indian Child Welfare Act, {{usc|25|1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intervention===
The tribe and parents or Indian custodian of the Indian child have an unqualified right to intervene in a case involving foster care placement or the termination of parental rights .  The intervention may be at any time, and not just at the beginning of the proceedings.&lt;ref name=ICWA1912 /&gt;&lt;ref name=JonesTilden88&gt;Jones, The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook, p.88-89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF46&gt;A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act, p. 46-49&lt;/ref&gt;  This right does not apply to pre-adoption or adoption proceedings unless it also includes the termination of parental rights.&lt;ref name=NARF46 /&gt;

===Transfer to Tribal Court===

====Motion to Transfer====
In a foster care or termination of parental rights case where the tribe and the state exercise concurrent jurisdiction, the tribe, either biological parent, or the Indian custodian may move to transfer the case from the state court to the tribal court.
&lt;ref name=ICWA1911 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF56&gt;A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act, p. 56-63&lt;/ref&gt;  The ICWA technically allows transfer to the tribal court at any time in the proceeding, but state courts vary on how they view transfer requests after state court proceedings are well into the adjudication process.  In some cases the state will look to the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] to deny such a transfer based on that law's time standards.&lt;ref name=NARF56 /&gt;&lt;ref name=JonesTilden65&gt;Jones, The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook, p.65-67.&lt;/ref&gt;  After a motion for transfer has been made, there is a presumption that the tribal court will receive the case and the state court is required to make the transfer unless one of three factors is present.&lt;ref name=ICWA1911 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF56 /&gt;

====Objection to Transfer====
A biological parent, whether Indian or non-Indian may object to and veto a proposed transfer of a case to tribal court.  A prospective parent, the Indian child, or another party may object, but may not veto a transfer, and those objections would be covered under the "good cause" provision.  In the event that a parent vetoes the transfer, the case will remain in state court.  This is most commonly seen where one of the parents is non-Indian.&lt;ref name=ICWA1911 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF56 /&gt;&lt;ref name=JonesTilden65 /&gt;

====Declination by Tribal Court====
The tribal court may decline to accept the transfer of a case from a state court.&lt;ref name=ICWA1911 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF56 /&gt;  An example is where the parents move to transfer the case, but the tribe declines to accept jurisdiction due to a lack of funding for programs that would support the child and the parents at the tribal level that are present at the state level.&lt;ref&gt;Cavanagh, Michael F. (2010), "American Indian Law: State Court Administrative Office – Court Improvement Program: Indian Child Welfare Act Forum: October 6, 2008," 89 Mich. Bar Journal 23 (State Bar of Michigan)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In re Interest of Bianca H. and Eternity H. |vol=2008 |reporter=Neb. App. LEXIS |opinion=240 |pinpoint= |court=Neb. App. |date=2008 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that a tribal court may not be a traditional tribunal, but may be any other administrative body empowered by the tribe to act on child custody matters.&lt;ref name=NARF67&gt;A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act, p. 67-72&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Active Remediation Efforts ====
One aspect of the ICWA that may provide the most hope for Native American families is the requirement of active efforts with the existing family to rehabilitate the root cause prior to removal of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://csuglobal.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.csuglobal.idm.oclc.org/docview/1812610354?accountid=38569|title=Implementing and defending the indian child welfare act through revised state requirements.

By engaging at risk families, and providing services, the family may be healed and the outcome for both the child and the family is changed dramatically for the better.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://csuglobal.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.csuglobal.idm.oclc.org/docview/1635437017?accountid=38569|title=Child welfare in Indian country: A story of painful removals.Health Affairs, 33(12), 2256-2259|last=Cross|first=T.L|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focus on remediation and rehabilitative services to protect the family, unique services that are geared to tribal values are offered, to help parents understand their roles as parents in the culture. Early intervention and support helps caregivers and families achieve better outcomes by addressing parenting skills, addictions, domestic violence and housing instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://csuglobal.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.csuglobal.idm.oclc.org/docview/1509394991?accountid=38569|title=A collaborative and trauma-informed practice model for urban Indian child welfare. Child Welfare, 91(3), 89-112|last=Lucero, N. M., &amp; Bussey, M.|first=|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results in an study of intervention/support indicated 81% preservation of the existing family, or placed with extended family. By working with ICWA and the tribes to create preventative services that are culturally sensitive, outcomes can be dramatically changed. Those services need not be limited to tribal members, but also available to foster and adoptive families to help connect with the child's cultural roots.

====Good Cause====
A state court may decline to transfer a case for "good cause," but that term is not defined in the ICWA.  The BIA has issued an advisory set of guidelines for state courts to use in determining "good cause."&lt;ref name=NARF56 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BIAGuide&gt;Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, {{USFR|44|67584}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While these guidelines are not mandatory, many states have adopted them, and they include:

===Existing Indian Family Exception===

====History of the Exception====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:File-Indian Backword class child.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Indian Backwordclass child]] --&gt;
In 1982, the [[Kansas Supreme Court]] held that the ICWA " was not to dictate that an illegitimate infant who has never been a member of an Indian home or culture, and probably never would be, should be removed from its primary cultural heritage and placed in an Indian environment over the express objections of its non-Indian mother."&lt;ref name=SCOKBabyL&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In re Baby Boy L. |vol=643 |reporter=P.2d |opinion=168 |pinpoint= |court=Kan. |date=1982 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the facts of the case, the court stated that the ICWA did not apply unless the child was part of an "existing Indian family unit."  The court denied the [[Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma]] the right to intervene in the case, stating that the ICWA did not apply. The court also held that even if the ICWA did apply,  the trial court committed no [[harmless error|reversible error]] because the non-Indian mother would have objected to the transfer of the case to a tribal court and, thus, defeated the transfer.&lt;ref name=SCOKBabyL /&gt;

From the Kansas Supreme Court case sprang a body of jurisprudence around the "existing Indian family" exception to ICWA.  In the years following the Kansas ''Baby Boy L.'' case, approximately half of the states adopted or expanded upon this "existing Indian family" exception, despite the fact that the language appeared nowhere in the text of the ICWA.&lt;ref name=NARF1&gt;A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act, p. 1-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewerenz&gt;Lewerenz, Dan; McCoy, Padraic (2010) "The End of "Existing Indian Family" Jurisprudence: Holyfield at 20, In the Matter of A.J.S., and the Last Gasps of a Dying Doctrine," 36 Wm.Mit.L.R. 684 (William Mitchell College of Law)&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to the Kansas ''Baby Boy L.'' case, in 1989, the [[United States Supreme Court]] heard ''[[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield]].'' {{ussc|490|30|1989}}&lt;ref name=SCOTUS&gt;Like the ''Baby Boy L.'' case, ''[[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield]]''{{ussc|490|30|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the ''Baby Boy L.'' case, both parents in ''Holyfield'' consented to the voluntary termination of their parental rights and adoption of their infant by a non-Indian family.  Unlike the parents in ''Baby Boy L.'', the mother in this case lived on the reservation both before and after the birth of the child off-reservation.  The Supreme Court found that the child was "domiciled" on the reservation because its biological mother was domiciled on the reservation. Therefore, the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribal court under ICWA should have been invoked.  The case was remanded to the tribal court for a custody determination three years after the child had been placed with non-Indian adoptive parents.   Noting the potential disruption in the child's life, the Supreme Court noted that any potential harm could have been avoided if the parents and state court had not wrongfully denied the tribe its rights under ICWA.&lt;ref name=SCOTUS/&gt;

While the Supreme Court did not consider the "existing Indian family" exception, some sources cite ''Holyfield'' as an implicit  rejection of  the exception.&lt;ref name=NARF1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewerenz /&gt;&lt;ref name=JonesTilden30&gt;Jones, The Indian Child Welfare Act Handbook, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;  Other sources have noted that the ''Holyfield'' case is relied upon as support for both sides of the debate over the "existing Indian family" exception:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Surprisingly, ''Holyfield'' has been relied upon by courts and parties both to support and reject the existing Indian family exception, which has been invoked in proceedings involving Indian children and families who are living off the reservation and who are, therefore, subject to state court jurisdiction concurrent with that of the tribal court.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Toni Hahn (1993) "The Existing Indian Family Exception to the Indian Child Welfare Act," 69 N. Dak. L. Rev. 465 (University of North Dakota School of Law)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of 2010, [[Alabama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=S.A. v. E.J.P. |vol=571 |reporter=So.2d |opinion=1187 |pinpoint= |court=Ala. Civ.

App. |date=1997 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; still use the "existing Indian family" exception.   Alabama and Indiana have limited its application by further court decisions.&lt;ref name=Lewerenz /&gt;  Nineteen states have rejected the doctrine, either by court decision or statute, including Kansas, where the Kansas Supreme Court expressly overturned the ''Baby L.'' decision in ''In re A.J.S.'', stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Given all of the foregoing, we hereby overrule Baby Boy L., (citation omitted), and abandon its existing Indian family doctrine. Indian heritage and the treatment of it has a unique history in United States law. A.J.S. has both Indian and non-Indian heritage, and courts are right to resist essentializing any ethnic or racial group. However, ICWA's overall design, including its "good cause" threshold in 25 U.S.C. 1915, ensures that all interests—those of both natural parents, the tribe, the child, and the prospective adoptive parents—are appropriately considered and safeguarded. ICWA applies to this state court child custody proceeding involving A.J.S., and the Cherokee Nation must be permitted to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In re A.J.S. |vol=204 |reporter=P.3d |opinion=543 |pinpoint= |court=Kan. |date=2009 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In June 2016, the Department of Interior specifically rejected the existing Indian family exception.&lt;ref&gt;81 Fed. Reg. 38801-2 (June 14, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations reflect not only that courts who rejected the doctrine were correct to do so, but also that "Congress did not intend to limit ICWA's applicability to those Tribal citizens actively involved in Indian culture." &lt;ref&gt;81 Fed. Reg. 38802 (June 14, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms====
Some critics have complained that the existing Indian family exception requires the state court to determine what it means to be an Indian child or an Indian family, by applying tests to determine the "Indian-ness" of the child.  One such test involved evaluating if the child lived "in an 'actual Indian dwelling,' apparently thinking of a teepee, hogan, or pueblo."&lt;ref name=Johnson398&gt;Johnson, Kevin R., p. 398&lt;/ref&gt;  Another work notes that "state courts have taken it upon themselves to determine individuals' relationship with their tribes by examining such contacts as subscription to a tribal newsletter."&lt;ref name=Lemont125&gt;Lemont, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 1997 testimony before the Joint Hearing of the [[House Resources Committee]] and the [[Senate Committee on Indian Affairs]], Assistant Secretary of the Interior [[Ada Deer]] ([[Menominee|Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin]]) stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... we want to express our grave concern that the objectives of the ICWA continue to be frustrated by State court created judicial exceptions to the ICWA. We are concerned that State court judges who have created the "existing Indian family exception" are delving into the sensitive and complicated areas of Indian cultural values, customs and practices which under existing law have been left exclusively to the judgment of Indian tribes ... We oppose any legislative recognition of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indian.senate.gov/hearings/618_ada.htm |title=Statement of Ada E.

===Foster Care Placement and Adoption===
"Foster care placement" is defined as "any action removing an Indian child from its parent or Indian custodian for temporary placement in a foster home or institution or the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent or Indian custodian cannot have the child returned upon demand, but where parental rights have not been terminated".&lt;ref name=ICWA1903 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NARF86&gt;A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act, p. 86-89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl==

The Supreme Court issued a decision pertaining to the ICWA in the case ''[[Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl]]'', on June 25, 2013.  In a 5-4 opinion delivered by Justice [[Samuel Alito]], the Supreme Court held that the heightened standard required under § 1912(f) of ICWA does not apply when the parent in question never had physical or legal custody of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What the Court's 'Baby Veronica' Ruling Means for Fathers and Native Americans|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/06/what-the-courts-baby-veronica-ruling-means-for-fathers-and-native-americans/277215/|publisher=The Atlantic|last=Cohen|first=Andrew|date=25 June 2013|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Globalize/US|date=December 2010}}

An '''interlocutory appeal''' (or '''interim appeal'''), in the law of [[civil procedure]] in the United States, occurs when a ruling by a trial court is [[appeal]]ed while other aspects of the case are still proceeding. Interlocutory appeals are allowed only under specific circumstances, which are laid down by the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal]] and the separate [[State court (United States)|state court]]s.

==United States==
An appeal is described as interlocutory when it is made before all claims are resolved as to all parties. For instance, if a lawsuit contains claims for breach of contract, fraud and interference with contractual advantage, and if there are three defendants in this lawsuit, then until all three claims are resolved as to all three defendants, any appeal by any party will be considered interlocutory. The American courts disfavor such appeals, requiring parties to wait until all the claims as to all parties are resolved before any appeal can be brought to challenge any of the decisions made by the [[judge]] during the life of the case.  "Although the general rule requires finality in order for a matter to be appealable, there are exceptions arising principally from court rules that permit appeal of interlocutory matters under specific circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 2:3–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Interlocutory appeals may be brought, however, if waiting to bring an appeal would be particularly prejudicial to the rights of one of the parties. For example, if a party is asserting some form of [[wikt:immunity|immunity]] from suit, or is claiming that the court completely lacks [[personal jurisdiction]] over them, then it is recognized that being forced to wait for the conclusion of the trial would violate their right not to be subjected to a trial at all. Alternatively, the trial judge can "certify" one of his orders for immediate interlocutory appeal. Suppose all the claims and issues have been resolved as to one of the defendants, but the rest of the parties will be fighting out the case for another year or ten. The trial judge could "certify" (i.e. signal his agreement) to allow the part of the cases that is concluded at trial level to be appealed.

===Federal courts===
The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] delineated the test for the availability of interlocutory appeals, called the collateral order doctrine, for [[United States federal courts]] in the case of ''[[Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser|volume=490|page=495|pin=|year=1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; holding that under the relevant statute ({{UnitedStatesCode|28|1291}}) such an appeal would be permitted only if:

#the outcome of the case would be conclusively determined by the issue;
#the matter appealed was collateral to the [[merit (legal)|merits]]; and
#the matter was effectively unreviewable if immediate appeal were not allowed.

The Supreme Court created the test in the case ''Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.|volume=337|page=541|pin=|year=1949}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where it was applied to a requirement of bond to be posted in certain stockholders derivative actions by plaintiffs, in anticipation of being liable for defendant's attorney's fees. Since the substantial deterrent effect of the statute would be meaningless if not enforceable at the outset of litigation, but did not touch on the merits of plaintiff's claim, the Court allowed interlocutory appeal from the trial court's decision.&lt;ref&gt;337 U.S. at 546–47.&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine was restricted in ''Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct Inc.|volume=511|page=863|pin=|year=1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which added an explicit importance criterion to the test for interlocutory appeals, holding that relief on a claim of immunity from suit because of a previous settlement agreement could not come through interlocutory appeal. The Supreme Court stated that the only matters of sufficient importance to merit a collateral appeal were "those originating in the Constitution or statutes".&lt;ref&gt;511 U.S. at 879.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several U.S. statutes directly confer the right to interlocutory appeals, including appeals from orders denying [[arbitration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|9|16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and some judicial actions against the [[debtor]] upon filing [[bankruptcy proceedings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|11|362|a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a major split in the [[United States courts of appeals]] as to whether a [[stay of proceedings]] should issue in the [[United States district court|district court]] while interlocutory appeals on the arbitrability of disputes are decided.&lt;ref&gt;Compare ''Bradford–Scott Data Corp., Inc. v. Physician Computer Network, Inc.'', [https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/128/504/525150/ 128 F.3d 504] (7th Cir. 1997), and {{cite court |litigants=Britton v. Co-op Banking Group |vol=916 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=1405 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=1990 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/916/1405/207799/ |accessdate=2018-05-23 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interlocutory appeal under the collateral order doctrine usually merits a stay of proceedings while the appeal is being decided.  Currently, the Second and Ninth Circuits have refused to stay proceedings in the district court while an arbitration issue is pending.&lt;ref&gt;''See Motorola Credit Corp. v. Uzan'', [https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/388/39/569803/ 388 F.3d 39, 53–54] (2d Cir. 2004); ''Britton'', 916 F.2d at 1412.&lt;/ref&gt; The Seventh, Tenth and Eleventh Circuit courts conversely hold that a non-frivolous appeal warrants a stay of proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''See Bradford–Scott Data Corp.'', 128 F.3d at 506; ''Blinco v. Green Tree Servicing, LLC'', [https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/366/1249/569939/ 366 F.3d 1249, 1251–52] (11th Cir. 2004); {{cite court |litigants=McCauley v.

Appx. |opinion=760 |pinpoint= |court=10th Cir. |date=2005 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/166883/mccauley-v-halliburton-energy/ |accessdate=2018-05-23 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State courts===
In [[California]], interlocutory appeals are usually sought by filing a [[petition#Legal|petition]] for [[writ of mandate]] with the [[California Courts of Appeal|Court of Appeal]].  If granted, the writ directs the appropriate [[Superior Courts of California|superior court]] to vacate a particular order.  Writs of mandate are a discretionary remedy; such petitions are almost always denied due to the state's public policy of encouraging efficient litigation of civil actions on the merits in the superior courts.

In [[New Jersey]], "[t]he discretionary jurisdiction of the Appellate Division over appeals taken from interlocutory decisions of lower courts and of state administrative officers and agencies exists as a result of the combination of constitutional provisions and court rules."&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 10:1–1&lt;/ref&gt;  "The standard set out in the Rules of Court for determining whether to grant leave to appeal an interlocutory decision is, simply, that 'the Appellate Division may grant leave to appeal, in the interest of justice.'"&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 10:2–1&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New York (state)|New York]], various interlocutory appeals can be found under the [[New York Civil Practice Law and Rules|Civil Practice Law and Rules]] section 5701. This section, along with a writ of mandamus are the only exceptions to filing an appeal only after the final judgment has been given.

In [[North Carolina]], the trial court judge may certify an interlocutory order for an appeal. Notably, such certification is not binding on the North Carolina Court of Appeals, meaning that the North Carolina Court of appeals is free to refuse to review an interlocutory appeal even though the trial court had certified it. On the other hand, even when the trial court does not certify on order for immediate appeal, the North Carolina Court of Appeals may grant a [[writ of certiorari]] to review an interlocutory appeal on the basis of the so-called "substantial right." Whether the North Carolina Court of Appeals concludes that a substantial right is affected and decides to grant of a writ is not always easily predictable. The North Carolina has adopted a two-part test for the appropriateness of an appeal of an interlocutory order: Whether a substantial right is affected by the challenged order and whether this substantial right might be lost, prejudiced, or inadequately preserved in the absence of an immediate appeal. As the North Carolina Court of Appeals itself said on many occasions, "the substantial right test is more easily stated than applied." Some rights that the North Carolina Court of Appeals has recently found to be substantial are: the right to conduct business and get paid.
A notable exception to the rule that all orders are interlocutory until the final issue is resolved is the issue of unresolved attorney's fees. In 2013, the Supreme Court of North Carolina clarified that all appeals can and must be taken from the trial courts' orders even if the attorney's fees were still unresolved. 
In 2013 the North Carolina lawmaking body substantially liberalized the appeals from the decisions of North Carolina family law courts (i.e., the divorce courts, applying N.C. Gen. Stat. §50). Until 2013, the litigants had to wait until the trial court resolved all divorce related issues until they could appeal any of the trial court's orders. For instance, an order resolving alimony could not be appealed until the court also resolved child support, division of property, and child custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Law Allows Each Claim in Divorce to be Appealed Separately|work=Family Law Appeals in North Carolina Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new law N.C. Gen. Stat. 50-19.1 allows divorcing spouses to appeal each of these unrelated orders as soon as they are entered.

In [[Louisiana]], parties to both civil and criminal cases may apply for [[supervisory writs]] in one of the state's five geographic [[Louisiana Courts of Appeal|Circuit Courts of Appeal]], seeking to review a ruling or order of the [[United States District Court for the District of Louisiana|district court]].  As the name implies, the Court of Appeal's power to consider a writ application stems from its supervisory jurisdiction over the district courts.  Such jurisdiction is discretionary, and thus the appellate court may issue an action granting or denying the writ, or may decline to consider the merits of an application altogether.  In practice, taking writs is far more common in criminal matters and most often involves objections to a district court's pre-trial rulings on [[motion (legal)|defense motions]] to [[motion to suppress|suppress evidence]], statements, or identifications.  An application for supervisory writs is also the mechanism for seeking review of a district court's decision to grant or deny a petition for [[post-conviction relief]].  A party aggrieved by the Court of Appeal's ruling on a supervisory writ may then apply for supervisory writs in the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]].

The '''International Coffee Agreement''' ('''ICA''') is an [[international commodity agreement]] between coffee producing countries and consuming countries. First signed in 1962, it is aimed at maintaining exporting countries' quotas and keeping coffee prices high and stable in the market,&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia" /&gt; mainly using export [[Quota share|quotas]] to steer the price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last = Bożyk  |first = Paweł  |title = Globalization and the transformation of foreign economic policy  |publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.  |year = 2006  |page = 98  |isbn = 978-0-7546-4638-9  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iuHsIuez5qoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Coffee Organization]], the controlling body of the agreement, represents all [[List of countries by coffee production|major coffee producing countries]] and most consuming countries.

The current 2007 agreement has 42 exporting members and 7 importing (the [[European Union]] represents all its member states as one member).&lt;ref name="ICO Members" /&gt;

==History==
The original agreement was signed in 1962 for a five-year period, and since then there have been six subsequent agreements, ratified in 1968, 1976, 1983, 1994, 2001 and 2007.

===Background===
The precursor to the ICA was the Inter-American Coffee Agreement (IACA) established during the [[Second World War]]. The war had created the conditions for a Latin American coffee agreement: European markets were closed off, the price of coffee was in decline and the United States feared that the declining price could drive Latin American countries—especially Brazil—towards [[Nazism|Nazi]] or Communist sympathies.&lt;ref name="Fridell122"&gt;{{harvnb|Fridell|2007|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fridell139" /&gt;

In 1940, the United States agreed to restrict its imports to a quota of 15.9 million bags, and other Latin American countries agreed to restrict their production.&lt;ref name="Fridell122-124"&gt;{{harvnb|Fridell|2007|pp=122–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement had an immediate effect, the price almost doubled by the end of 1941.&lt;ref name="Fridell122" /&gt; After the end of the war in 1945 the price of coffee rose continuously&lt;ref name="Fridell139"&gt;{{harvnb|Fridell|2007|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meerhaeghe161"&gt;{{harvnb|Meerhaeghe|1998|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1955–57 when a degree of [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] was reached.

Producers sought ways to maintain the price,&lt;ref name="Meerhaeghe162"&gt;{{harvnb|Meerhaeghe|1998|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; this led to the first International Coffee Agreement.&lt;ref name="Meerhaeghe161" /&gt; A target price was set, and export quotas allocated to each producer.&lt;ref name="Daviron87"&gt;{{harvnb|Daviron|Ponte|2005|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the indicator price set by the [[International Coffee Organization]] (ICO) fell below the target price, quotas were decreased; if it rose above it, quotas were increased.&lt;ref name="Daviron87" /&gt; Although the system had its problems, it was successful in raising and stabilizing the price.&lt;ref name="Daviron87" /&gt;

The International Coffee Organization was established in 1963 to administer the clauses of the agreement and supervise the mechanisms in place. Until 1986 the Coffee Council, the decision-making body of ICO, approved export quotas.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book  |last = Leonard  |first = Thomas M.  |title = Encyclopedia of the developing world, Volume 2 |publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis |year = 2006 |page = 840 |isbn = 978-0-415-97663-3 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pWRjGZ9H7hYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakdown of the 1989 agreement===
In 1989, ICO failed to reach an agreement on new export quotas, causing the 1983 ICA to break down.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | year=1993 | title=Commodity Trade and Price Trends, 1989–91 Edition | publisher=World Bank Publications | isbn=978-0-8213-1359-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6K9Y6TKv264C&amp;pg=PR12 | page=xii }}&lt;/ref&gt; The disagreement was triggered by consumers' change in taste towards milder and higher quality coffee.&lt;ref name="sun" /&gt; With the retained quotas from the 1983 agreement, the change increased the value of milder coffee at the expense of more traditional varieties such as [[Robusta coffee|robusta]].&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt; Brazil in particular – the world's most powerful coffee producer – refused to reduce its quotas believing it would lower their market share.&lt;ref name="sun" /&gt;&lt;ref name="apn87" /&gt; The consumers, led by the United States, demanded higher quality coffee and the end of selling coffee to non-members at reduced rates.&lt;ref name="apn89" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ny89" /&gt;

The US criticized Brazil for not being willing to accept a reduction of the country's quotas despite falling share of the world market since 1980.&lt;ref name="apn87" /&gt; Jorio Dauster, head of the state-controlled Brazilian Coffee Institute, described Brazil as an "extremely efficient producer" and believed it could survive without help from ICO.&lt;ref name="sun" /&gt;&lt;ref name="apn87" /&gt;

The 1983 ICA was set to expire on 1 October 1989, but realizing that it would be impossible to enter into a new agreement before the termination date, the Coffee Council (ICO's highest body) effectively decided to suspend the export quotas on 4 July 1989.&lt;ref name="apn89" /&gt; Without an extended agreement producing countries lost most of their influence on the international market.&lt;ref name="Daviron88"&gt;{{harvnb|Daviron|Ponte|2005|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICO's average indicator price for the last five years previous the end of the regime fell from US$1.34 per pound, to US$0.77 per pound for the first five years after.&lt;ref name="Daviron88" /&gt;

According to Yves Engler's ''Canada in Africa'', "no longer worried about the prospect of poor coffee producers turning towards the Soviet Union, the US withdrew its support from the International Coffee Agreement in 1989."

==Members==
The current 2007 ICA entered into force on 2 February 2011 when it was approved by two-thirds of the exporting and importing signatory governments.&lt;ref name="ICO History 2011"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ico.org/ica2007.asp| title = 2007| publisher  = [[International Coffee Organization]]| accessdate  = 10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013}}, it has 51 members, of which 44 are exporting members, and 7 importing (the [[European Union]] represents all its 28 member states).&lt;ref name="ICO Members"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ico.org/members_e.asp?section=About_Us| title = ICO Members| publisher = [[International Coffee Organization]]| accessdate  = 22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ICO, its members represent 97% of all coffee production and 80% of the consumption.&lt;ref name="ICO Mission"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ico.org/mission07_e.asp |title=Mission |publisher=[[International Coffee Organization]] |accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:International waters.svg|right|thumb|400px|Areas outside exclusive economic zones in dark blue.]]
The terms '''international waters''' or '''trans-boundary waters''' apply where any of the following types of bodies of water (or their [[drainage basin]]s) transcend international boundaries: oceans, [[large marine ecosystem]]s, enclosed or semi-enclosed regional seas and [[estuaries]], rivers, lakes, [[groundwater]] systems ([[aquifer]]s), and [[wetland]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.org/gef/05/portfolio/iw.html International Waters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090127055412/http://www.undp.org/gef/05/portfolio/iw.html |date=27 January 2009 }}, ''United Nations Development Programme''&lt;/ref&gt;

International waters have no sovereignty, ergo is "[[Terra nullius]]" as no state controls it. All states have the freedom of: fishing, navigation, overflight, laying cables and pipelines, as well as research.

Oceans, seas, and waters outside national jurisdiction are also referred to as the '''high seas''' or, in [[Latin]], ''mare liberum'' (meaning ''free sea''). The [[Convention on the High Seas]], signed in 1958, which has 63 signatories, defined "high seas" to mean "all parts of the sea that are not included in the [[territorial sea]] or in the [[internal waters]] of a State" and where "no State may validly purport to
subject any part of them to its sovereignty."&lt;ref&gt;Text of [http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/entri/texts/high.seas.1958.html CONVENTION ON THE HIGH SEAS] (U.N.T.S. No. 6465, vol. 450, pp. 82–103)&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention on the High Seas was used as a foundation for the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], signed in 1982, which recognized [[Exclusive Economic Zones]] extending 200 nautical miles from the baseline, where coastal States have sovereign rights to the water column and sea floor as well as the natural resources found there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the EEZ|url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/eez.html|publisher=National Ocean Service|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ships sailing the high seas are generally under the jurisdiction of the [[flag state]] (if there is one);&lt;ref&gt;UNCLOS article 92(1)&lt;/ref&gt; however, when a ship is involved in certain criminal acts, such as [[piracy]],&lt;ref&gt;UNCLOS article 105&lt;/ref&gt; any nation can exercise jurisdiction under the doctrine of [[universal jurisdiction]]. International waters can be contrasted with [[internal waters]], [[territorial waters]] and [[exclusive economic zones]].

==International waterways==
[[Image:Komárom114.JPG|thumb|[[Komárno]] in Slovakia is an [[inland port]] on the [[Danube River]] which is an important international [[waterway]].]]

Several international treaties have established [[Freedom of the seas|freedom of navigation]] on semi-enclosed seas.

* The [[Sound Dues#Copenhagen Convention|Copenhagen Convention]] of 1857 opened access to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] by abolishing the [[Sound Dues]] and making the [[Danish Straits]] an international waterway free to all commercial and military shipping.
* Several conventions have opened the [[Bosphorus]] and [[Dardanelles]] to shipping. The latest, the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits]], maintains the straits' status as an international waterway.

Other international treaties have opened up rivers, which are not traditionally international waterways.

* The [[Danube River]] is an international waterway so that landlocked [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Moldova]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovakia]] can have secure access to the [[Black Sea]].

==Disputes over international waters==
[[File:Clouds over the Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|250px|Atlantic Ocean – the main zone of sea transport in 15th–20th centuries.]]
{{See also|Territorial claims in the Arctic|Northwest Passage|Australian Antarctic territorial waters}}

Current unresolved disputes over whether particular waters are "International waters" include:
*The Arctic Ocean: While Canada, Denmark, Russia and Norway all regard parts of the Arctic seas as ''national waters'' or ''[[internal waters]]'', most [[European Union]] countries and the United States officially regard the whole region as international waters. The [[Northwest Passage]] through the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] is one of the more prominent examples, with Canada claiming it as [[internal waters]], while the United States and the [[European Union]] considers it an international strait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

*The [[Southern Ocean]]: Australia claims an [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) around its Antarctic territorial claim. Since this claim is only recognised by four other countries, the EEZ claim is also disputed.
*Area around [[Okinotorishima]]: Japan claims Okinotorishima is an [[islet]] and thus they should have an EEZ around it, but some neighboring countries claim it is an [[atoll]] and thus should not have an EEZ.
*[[South China Sea]]: See [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea]]. Some countries{{ref|a}} consider (at least part of) the South China Sea as international waters, but this viewpoint is not universal. Notably, China, which opposes any suggestion that coastal States could be obliged to share the resources of the exclusive economic zone with other powers that had historically fished there, claims historical rights to the resources of the exclusive economic zones of all other coastal States in the South China Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.huanqiu.com/globaltimes/2011-11/2195130.html|title=学者：南海不存在公海 他国不能横行霸道_历史_环球网|first=|last=李侠|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422154032/http://history.huanqiu.com/globaltimes/2011-11/2195130.html|archive-date=22 April 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition to formal disputes, the government of Somalia exercises little control ''de facto'' over Somali territorial waters. Consequently, much [[Piracy in Somalia|piracy]], illegal dumping of waste and fishing without permit has occurred.

Although water is often seen as a source of conflict, recent research suggests that water management can be a source for cooperation between countries. Such cooperation will benefit participating countries by being the catalyst for larger socio-economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2011/01/20/blue-peace-rethinking-middle-east-water-event-3137|title=The Blue Peace: Rethinking Middle East Water|first=Selim Catafago, Fadi Comair, Paul Salem, Sundeep|last=Waslekar|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the countries of the Senegal River Basin that cooperate through the Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Sénégal (OMVS) have achieved greater socio-economic development and overcome challenges relating to agriculture and other issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/20795water-cooperature-sm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kevin Reynolds''' is an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Catholic]] priest who was falsely alleged in a news feature on [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] (the national television network of Ireland) to have raped and impregnated a [[Kenya]]n teenager. A scandal ensued when the allegations were discovered to be false, which generated intensive media coverage and political debate in Ireland, resulting in a government inquiry into the broadcaster.&lt;ref name="mediareport"&gt;[http://www.themediareport.com/nov2011/rte-ireland-fr-kevin-reynolds-falsely-accused.htm Irish TV Network Defames Innocent Priest, Issues Apology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120012444/http://www.themediareport.com/nov2011/rte-ireland-fr-kevin-reynolds-falsely-accused.htm |date=20 November 2011 }}, ''The Media Report'', November 2011, accessed 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc_republic_government_probes_rte_libel_case&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15850770 Republic's government order probe into RTE Fr Reynolds libel case], ''BBC News'', 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The allegations were made in a report by journalist [[Aoife Kavanagh]] titled "[[Mission to Prey]]", which aired in May 2011 on the ''[[Prime Time (Irish TV programme)|Prime Time]]'' programme. Kavanagh alleged that during his time as a missionary in Kenya, Reynolds had raped and impregnated a minor named Veneraanda, fathering a child called Sheila. Kavanagh also alleged that Reynolds had secretly provided financial support to Sheila over a number of years. Both Veneranda and Sheila were interviewed on the programme to corroborate the allegations. The events were purported to have taken place in the Diocese of Kakamega in Kenya.

Prior to the broadcasting of the show, Reynolds volunteered to have DNA testing undertaken to prove his innocence but this offer was refused by RTÉ. Later, two separate and independent DNA tests established that Reynolds was not the father of the child. With this it emerged that the allegations were entirely baseless. However, as a result of the broadcast, Reynolds was removed from his home and his parish ministry.&lt;ref name="allen1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/all-things-catholic/new-symbol-false-sex-abuse-allegations | first=John | last=Allen | work=National Catholic Reporter | title=A new symbol of false sex abuse allegations | date=2011-12-02 | accessdate=2011-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it became public knowledge that Reynolds had been falsely accused, RTÉ broadcast an apology to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1006/apology.html|title=Apology - Fr Kevin Reynolds|work=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]]|accessdate=19 November 2011|date=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/av/2011/1118/media-3115837.html |title=(Audio) Morning Ireland: RTÉ apology to Fr Kevin Reynolds |work=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=19 November 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Prime Time (Irish TV programme)|Prime Time]]'' Investigates, the series on which the allegations were broadcast, was immediately suspended.&lt;ref name=bbc_republic_government_probes_rte_libel_case/&gt; The [[Director-General of RTÉ]], [[Noel Curran]], admitted the broadcasting of "Mission to Prey" was "one of the gravest editorial mistakes ever made" at RTÉ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2011/1123/1224308004000.html?via=mr|title=RTÉ shelves investigative series and concedes 'grave mistake'|first=Paul|last=Cullen|author2=McGreevy, Ronan |work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=23 November 2011|date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; RTÉ staff, including [[Mike Murphy (broadcaster)|Mike Murphy]], [[John Bowman (broadcaster)|John Bowman]] and [[Sean O'Rourke]], publicly criticised the libel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/rte-stars-slam-shameful-libel-as-chiefs-step-aside-2945263.html|title=RTÉ stars slam 'shameful' libel as chiefs step aside|first=Geraldine|last=Gittens|work=Evening Herald|accessdate=24 November 2011|date=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of the Irish Missionary Union said that Aoife Kavanagh's continuing presence on ''Morning Ireland'' after being found guilty of defaming Reynolds was "unfair and unjust" and a demonstration of "double standards" in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1119/1224307823957.html|title=Reporter's broadcasts in wake of libel finding 'unfair'|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=23 November 2011|date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Reynolds agreed to an out-of-court libel settlement with RTÉ. The amount of the settlement was not disclosed. His solicitor also requested that the Irish justice minister, [[Alan Shatter]], "clarify that he accepts that Fr Reynolds was guilty of no wrongdoing", in response to Shatter's previous public support of "Mission to Prey" when it was broadcast in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/shatter-in-uturn-on-his-rash-support-for-prime-time-2946451.html|title=Shatter in U-turn on his 'rash' support for Prime Time|first=Michael|last=Brennan|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=26 November 2011|date=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Landman''' or "Petroleum Landman"—in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]—is an individual who performs various services for [[Petroleum|oil]] and gas exploration companies. According to the website of the [[American Association of Professional Landmen]] (AAPL), these services include but are not limited to: negotiating for the acquisition or divestiture of mineral rights; negotiating business agreements that provide for the exploration and/or development of minerals; determining ownership in minerals through the research of public and private records; reviewing the status of title, curing title defects and otherwise reducing title risk associated with ownership in minerals; managing rights and/or obligations derived from ownership of interests in minerals; and unitizing or pooling of interests in minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landman.org/|title=AAPL - America's Landmen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Since the services provided by the landman to the oil and gas exploration industry and other industries are so varied it is not uncommon for a landman to specialize in several different aspects of the profession at the same time. The term "landman" and nuances thereof also apply to women who practice the land management profession although a larger majority of practitioners continue to be men.

Numerous other industries, in addition to the petroleum industry, often require the skills and expertise of the landman, one of which is the wind industry. Wind development requires the locating of surface sites for turbines, determining surface ownership, negotiating lease agreements, and has many other similar duties performed by the petroleum landman. Telecommunications, pipeline, power and transportation projects, linear in nature, are generally right-of-way (ROW) projects and usually staffed by ROW agents.  The terms "landman" and "right-of-way agent" are often used interchangeably; however, their duties often vary significantly.  Landmen typically deal with site-specific projects (drill site) and leases, whereas ROW agents deal with linear corridor projects that can cross interstate and usually involve easement conveyance.

A particular degree is often not required of someone interested in becoming a landman, though it is favored. Few universities offer a petroleum land management degree but Western State Colorado University "Western", the University of Oklahoma, the University of Tulsa, the University of Louisiana Lafayette, Texas Tech University and University of Calgary are among those that do. The first and largest petroleum land management program was created in 1958 at the University of Oklahoma. It has since been re-branded as the "Energy Management Program". The AACSB International Southwestern Business Deans Association honored the program with The Most Innovative in Excellence Award for Curriculum Design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ou.edu/content/price/management_entrepreneurship/energy_management/bba.html University of Oklahoma - College of Business: BBA In Energy Management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915173750/http://www.ou.edu/content/price/management_entrepreneurship/energy_management/bba.html |date=15 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Someone interested in becoming a landman without obtaining a degree might go to the county courthouse and approach researchers in the Recorder's Office or Records Room.  Oftentimes, the individuals seen researching here are landmen. No experience is needed to take photos of books, and offering this service can be a foot in the door. Attempting to "shadow" a landman in a courthouse that you do not know is an easy way to get blackballed in that county, as some individuals will go to courthouses specifically to try to poach areas from other companies. Other times, individuals may contact a company looking for landmen that is open to training someone with no experience in the field.

Compensation or salary varies and is dependent on many factors such as experience, geographic location and the number of qualified landmen available in a given area. Many lawyers are practicing landmen and landmen/oil and gas attorneys. Due to the collapse in energy prices in the late 1980s which lasted for nearly two decades, into the early 2000s, most landmen who survived were retiring and most universities and colleges that offered petroleum land management degrees no longer did so. The resulting attrition combined with the spike in energy prices in the mid-2000s reversed the trends of earlier years and created a significant shortage of available landmen. The subsequent global financial collapse that began in 2008 once again reversed the boom and employment opportunities will likely continue their cyclical nature for years to come.

== American Association of Professional Landmen ==

The American Association of Professional Landmen (AAPL) is an organization of professional landmen, who agree to a standard code of ethics, a mission statement and other policies.  The AAPL offers certifications recognized throughout the industry as indicators of competency, proficiency and professionalism. AAPL offers three certifications that are proven to enhance a member’s credibility in the industry and to increase earning potential for landmen.
* Registered Landman (RL) – The initial level of certification, RL certification signifies a fundamental knowledge of the land industry as well as a landman’s commitment to furthering their education. This certification level requires the applicant to be sponsored by one RPL and complete a "take home" test with a passing grade, in addition to various experiential requirements and a fee.
* Registered Professional Landman (RPL) – The mid-level designation offered by AAPL, RPL certification distinguishes a landman as knowledgeable, experienced and professional. This certification level requires the applicant to be sponsored by three CPL certified individuals and complete a comprehensive proctored test, in addition to various experiential requirements and a fee.
* Certified Professional Landman (CPL) – The highest designation offered in the energy management industry, CPL certification is the standard by which landmen demonstrate their comprehensive competence, proficiency and professionalism in the landman field. This certification level requires the applicant to be sponsored by three CPL certified individuals and complete a comprehensive proctored test, in addition to various experiential requirements and a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Randy|title=Landman|url=http://landmaninsider.com/landman-certifications/|work=LandmanInsider|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best known{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} fictional landmen was John Brewster, played by the actor Frank Wilcox, on the television series ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' in the early 1960s. He was a landman for "The Tulsa Oil Company" who secured the lease for Jed Clampett's acreage and later got Jed to serve on its board of directors.

'''''Law and the Modern Mind''''' is a 1930 book by [[Jerome Frank]] which argued that [[judicial decision]]s were more influenced by psychological factors than by objective legal premises.

Frank, then a legal academic, published the book after having undergone six months of [[psychoanalysis]]. In it, he argued against the "basic legal myth" that judges never make law but simply deduce legal conclusions from premises that are clear, certain, and substantially unchanging. Drawing on psychologists such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jean Piaget]], Frank proposed that judicial decisions were motivated primarily by the influence of psychological factors on the individual judge.&lt;ref name="Volkomer"&gt;Walter E. Volkomer, "Frank, Jerome N.", in Roger K. Newman, ed., ''The Yale Biographical Dictionary of American Law'' (2009), p. 201-202.&lt;/ref&gt; Like his judicial hero, Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]], Frank urged judges and legal scholars to acknowledge openly the gaps and uncertainties in the law, and to think of law pragmatically as a tool for human betterment.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Frank, ''Law and the Modern Mind''. New York: Anchor Books, 1963, pp. 270-77.&lt;/ref&gt; The book "dropped like a bombshell on the legal and academic world",&lt;ref name="Volkomer"/&gt; quickly becoming "a jurisprudential bestseller" which "was widely noticed as well as criticized".&lt;ref&gt;Lon Luvois Fuller, Thomas W. Bechtler, ''Law in a Social Context: Liber Amicorum Honouring Professor Lon L. Fuller'' (1978), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="196336">{{Cleanup reorganize|date=January 2015}} {{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}The '''[[South Africa]]n law of succession''' prescribes the rules which determine the devolution of a person's estate after his death, and all matters incidental thereto. It identifies the beneficiaries who are entitled to succeed to the deceased's [[estate (law)|estate]], and the extent of the benefits they are to receive, and determines the different rights and duties that persons (for example, beneficiaries and creditors) may have in a deceased's estate. It forms part of [[private law]].

The manner in which assets are distributed depends on whether the deceased has left a valid will or other valid document containing testamentary provisions, such as an antenuptial contract. If the deceased has not left a valid will or valid document containing testamentary provisions, the deceased dies intestate; similarly, if the deceased leaves a valid will which does not dispose of all property, there is an intestacy as to the portion not disposed of. In the event of intestacy, the assets are distributed in a definite order of preference among the heirs, as stipulated by the Intestate Succession Act.&lt;ref&gt;Act 81 of 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently, the Act (and its common-law precursor) existed side-by-side with a statutorily-regulated customary-law regime of intestate succession, applied on a racial basis, but this was brought to an end when the Constitutional Court, in [[Bhe v Magistrate, Khayelitsha]], made the Intestate Succession Act applicable to all.

Where the deceased dies leaving a valid will, the rules of testate succession apply. These are derived from common law and the Wills Act.&lt;ref&gt;Act 7 of 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; Testate succession is governed by the general premise that the assets of the deceased are distributed in accordance with the provisions of the will. If specified property is left to a person, the disposition is termed a “legacy.” Legacies are distributed first; any residue in the estate is given to the person, if any, who is appointed as heir. If the will appoints more than one heir, the residue is divided among them.

== Dual character ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}The law of succession comprises two branches, namely the common law of succession and the customary law of succession. These enjoy equal status and are subject to the [[Constitution of South Africa]] and other legislation. The common law of succession is divided into the testate law of succession and the intestate law of succession, whereas the customary law of succession only operates intestate.

== Conflict of laws ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}There are various rules for determining whether the common-law rules or the customary-law rules are applicable:

* The common law of succession applies to testate succession except if a testator, living under customary law prescribed otherwise in his or her will or if a court decides otherwise.
* The [[Intestate Succession Act]]&lt;ref&gt;Act 81 of 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; applies to all intestate estates irrespective of the cultural affiliations of the deceased.

Succession may take place in three ways:

# in accordance with a valid will (testamentary succession);
# through the operation of intestate succession (without a valid will); and
# in terms of a succession agreement (''pactum successorium'') contained in a duly registered antenuptial contract or a ''[[Gift (law)|donatio mortis causa]]''.

== Scope of succession ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}The capacity to have rights and duties is called legal subjectivity, which is terminated by death. The consequences of the termination of legal subjectivity are as follows:

* The subject is known as the deceased.
* If the deceased has a valid will, he or she is known as a testator or testatrix respectively.
* The deceased's estate—all of the deceased's assets and liabilities—is gathered together.
* The deceased's debts and administration costs are paid.
* The remainder of the assets then pass to persons qualified to succeed him.

When a person dies, everything remaining of his assets (once debts, obligations and administrative costs have been reclaimed) passes by inheritance to those qualified to succeed him.

The law of succession is the totality of the legal rules which control the transfer of those assets of the deceased which are subject to distribution among beneficiaries, or those assets of another over which the deceased had the power of disposal.

If there is a valid will which sets out the wishes of the testator, the estate is administered in terms of the law of testate succession.&lt;ref&gt;Wills Act 7 of 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; A will is a unilateral declaration regarding how the estate is to be apportioned. A person may make also bequests in terms of an ante-nuptial contract. Both natural and juristic persons may be beneficiaries in terms of a will.

If there is no will, or if the will is invalid, the estate devolves in terms of the law of intestate succession.&lt;ref&gt;See Intestate Succession Act 81 of 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ground rules for succession ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}There are a few requirements (with exceptions) that must be fulfilled before the rules of succession can come into operation:

* The testator must have died.
* There must be a transfer of rights or duties with regard to the estate or the status of the deceased, depending on the nature of the succession rules (common law or customary law).
* At the time of ''dies cedit'', the beneficiary has to be alive or have been conceived.
* The beneficiary must be competent to inherit. (According to the Dutch rule ''de bloedige hand neemt geen erf'' a person convicted of either the murder or culpable homicide of the testator is not eligible to inherit.)

=== Person must have died ===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}In both the common and customary law of succession (in the case of property), a prerequisite for succession is that the owner of the estate must have died. In customary law, succession to status positions takes place only on the death of a family head, while the deaths of another family member does not give rise to succession to his or her status. The application of the rule is illustrated in ''[[Estate Orpen v Estate Atkinson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;1966 (4) SA 589 (A).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the requirement of the death of the testator seems so obvious, it is not always a simple matter. There are various examples of situations where the application of the rule has been problematic or deviated from.

==== Presumption of death ====
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}The first exception to the rule that a person must be dead before succession can occur, is where a court pronounces a presumption of death and makes an order for the division of the estate. Those who allege that a person is dead have to prove it. Where the body is present and can be identified, death can easily be proved. However, where a person has disappeared and a body has not been found, death is difficult to prove. Only when a court makes a presumption of death order can the disappeared person's estate be administered. Because it is possible that the deceased might still be alive, this case constitutes an exception to the rule that he or she must be dead before succession can occur. For this reason, it is also customary for a court to order that the estate of the person presumed to be dead should be distributed amongst his heirs subject to the provision of security that the estate can be returned to him should he reappear. Factors which a court may take into consideration in making such an order include the length of time that the person has been missing, the age, health and position in society of the missing person, as well as the circumstances of the disappearance. The principles applicable to judicial presumption of death have been reviewed in detail by the higher courts.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Re Beaglehole]]'', ''[[Ex parte Engelbrecht]]'', ''[[Ex parte Rungsamy]]'', ''[[Ex parte Govender]]'', ''[[Ex parte Pieters]]'' and ''[[Ex parte Stoter]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beneficiaries must be alive at the time of the testator's death, unless the testator makes provision for the benefit of persons born later. Death is proved by reporting the death to the Master and obtaining a death certificate signed by a medical practitioner. This is important: Without proof of death, the estate cannot be administered, and one's affairs cannot remain indefinitely in limbo.

In such circumstances, a person may approach the High Court for an order, granted on a balance of probabilities, presuming the death of another person. The effect of the order is to create a rebuttable presumption that the specified person is dead. The court may later reverse the order if the presumption is rebutted; it may also order that all persons who received a benefit from the devolved estate return the assets in terms of the law of unjustified enrichment.

If a person cannot get a presumption order, he may apply for an order for administration of the estate. In this case, all beneficiaries must furnish security for the assets received.

==== Estate massing ====
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}A second exception to the rule that a person must be dead can be found in the case of estate massing. When estates are massed, the entire estates or parts of the estates of various testators are consolidated into a single economic unit for the purpose of testamentary disposal. The effect of estate massing is that the surviving testator's estate dissolves according to the will of the first-dying whilst he or she is still alive.

Either party to a mutual will may, while both are alive, revoke his or her share of the mutual will with or without communication to the other party. But after the death of one party the survivor may not revoke his or her share of the mutual will where both the following further conditions or circumstances occur:

* the mutual will effects a “massing;” and
* the survivor has accepted some benefit under the will.

The term “massing” will first be explained, then the survivor's election will be discussed, and thereafter effect of the survivor repudiating or accepting benefits respectively will be considered.

Massing is a disposition by the testators in a mutual will of their joined property or of a portion of it in favour of the survivor, giving him or her a limited interest in the joined property, and providing that on his or her death such property is to go to some other person or persons. The limited interest conferred on the survivor is, as a rule, either a usufructuary or a fiduciary interest. For example, the testators leave “all property belonging to us to our children, subject to a usufruct in favour of the survivor;” in this case the survivor acquires a usufructuary interest in the massed property. Or, again, the testators may leave “our joint estate to the survivor, and after the death of the survivor to our children;” in this case the survivor acquires a fiduciary interest.

It will be seen that the effect of massing, if carried out, is to give the survivor one benefit and to deprive him or her of another. The survivor acquires a beneficial interest in the property of the first-dying which otherwise (in the absence of any will) the survivor would not have obtained, but the survivor no longer has the full ownership of his or her own share of the property which otherwise he or she would have retained. The survivor, however, is not bound to allow the mutual will to be carried into effect. If the survivor accepts the benefit, he or she must also accept the loss of an interest in his or her own property; the survivor cannot accept the benefit without its accompanying liability. It follows that the survivor has a choice or election whether to abide by the terms of the mutual will or to repudiate them.

===== Exercise of election by survivor =====
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}Whether the survivor has elected to abide by the terms of the mutual will or to repudiate them is a question of fact. The election is generally effected by the survivor in his or her capacity as executor (for the survivor is usually appointed executor testamentary) in framing the liquidation and distribution account. If the survivor takes the interest in the share of the first-dying in terms of the mutual will the survivor is deemed to have accepted the benefits and to have adiated. Vice versa, the survivor is held to repudiate the terms of the will if he or she does not take the interest in the share of the first-dying but assigns the estate of the deceased to the other beneficiaries.

If the survivor elects to abide by the will, or “adiates,” the survivor can be relieved of the consequences of such action if the survivor acted under a reasonable and excusable ignorance of his or her legal rights, but not if the survivor erroneously thought that adiation would be of greater benefit than it turned out to be. If, after adiation, a new will is discovered which adds to or alters the provisions of the earlier will, the survivor has a further opportunity to adiate or repudiate.

===== Effect of repudiation by survivor =====
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}If the survivor elects to take no benefit under the mutual will and thereby repudiates the will he or she is not bound by its terms. It follows that the survivor reverts to the legal position which he enjoyed before the death of the testator. The survivor accordingly may revoke his or her share of the mutual will, retain personal property and be free of the will's terms. The consequence is that the mutual will remains in force only in so far as it is the will of the first-dying and it operates only upon the latter's share of the property.

===== Effect of adiation by survivor =====
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}If the survivor accepts the benefits under the mutual will he or she becomes bound by its terms. The survivor is consequently under an obligation (of a contractual or quasi-contractual nature) to allow the jointly disposed of property to devolve in terms of the joint will. In other words, the mutual will now comes fully into operation and the survivor cannot revoke his or her share of it. The mutual will operates in effect as the will of the first-dying party and the survivor is a beneficiary under that will.

The rights of the ultimate beneficiaries in the massed estate have undergone considerable change. Under the common law their rights in the first-dying testator's share of the massed property were real rights, being conferred by will, while their right in the survivor's share were personal rights only since they were of a semi-contractual nature and since the will of one person cannot confer a real right in the property of another person. It followed that the survivor retained the dominium in his or her share of the property even after adiation, and could thus validly alienate or mortgage such share. If the survivor went insolvent after adiation and before transfer of the property to’ the beneficiaries the latter would rank merely as concurrent creditors in the insolvent estate. To remedy this state of affairs a vitally important change was made in 1913 by the Administration of Estates Act in respect of mutual wills of spouses married in community of property. Where such a will effected a massing and the survivor adiated, the Act in effect placed the two halves of the joint estate upon exactly the same footing by giving the beneficiaries the same rights in respect of the survivor's half as they possessed in the half of the first-dying spouse. Given the state of the common law at the time this meant that the beneficiaries acquired real rights in the entire estate. Under the modern system of administering deceased estates, however, the beneficiaries under a will acquire only personal rights against the executor before transfer to them of the bequeathed property.

It follows in the case of a massed estate that the ultimate beneficiaries acquire personal rights only in the first-dying's share of the estate and thus, by virtue of the legislation, in the half of the survivor too, on his or her adiation. This remains the position under the Administration of Estates Act of 1965, which re-enacted the earlier provision in somewhat wider terms, as follows: “If any two or more persons have by their mutual will massed the whole or any specific portion of their joint estate and disposed of the massed estate or of any portion thereof after the death of the first-dying, conferring upon the survivor or survivors any limited interest in respect of any property in the massed estate, then upon the death after the commencement of this Act [October 2, 1967] of the first-dying, adiation by the survivor or survivors shall have the effect of conferring upon the persons in whose favour such disposition was made, such rights in respect of any property forming part of the share of the survivor or survivors of the massed estate as they would by law have possessed under the will if that property had belonged to the first-dying.”

The 1965 Act, unlike the 1913 Act, is not, it is submitted, confined to spouses married in community of property despite the use of the words “joint estate” in the quoted extract. The intention of the legislature seems clear.

It must be noted that if the mutual will masses not the whole, but a portion merely of their estates, the will is irrevocable by the survivor in respect of the massed portion only.

==== Sequence of death ====
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}Another aspect worth mentioning, occurs when a number of people are killed in the same disaster (''commorientes'') and it is difficult to determine who died first. It might be important to be able to determine who died first in order to choose the beneficiaries, especially if the victims are family members. It could happen that the estate of the victims is devolved as if they died simultaneously whilst in actual fact one or more of them died at a later time.

Consider the following example: Corbin and Armand die in a plane crash in which there are no survivors. In terms of Corbin's will, Cameron is his only heir. Corbin's estate is only worth R100. In terms of Armand's will, Corbin is her only heir, and Armand was wealthy. If Corbin died after Armand and could first inherit from him, then Cameron, who inherits from Corbin, is in a favourable position. Cameron would want to prove that Armand died before Corbin. If Corbin and Armand died simultaneously and on impact, Corbin cannot inherit anything from Armand, as he was not alive at ''dies cedit'': that is, upon Armand's death.

The cardinal rule is that an heir, in order to inherit, must survive or outlive the deceased. When two persons die at the same time, it is important to know who died first, so as to determine if they may inherit.

In Roman-Dutch law, certain presumptions existed when members of the same family died in circumstances where it was difficult to determine who died first. It was always presumed that the wife died first. In England, there was a presumption that, when two persons died at the same time, the older of the two had died first.

The South African courts, however, did not apply these presumptions. The general rule is that, where there is no evidence of who survived whom, it is to be presumed that they died simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ex Parte Graham]]'' 1963 (4) SA 145.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Greyling v Greyling]]'', a husband and wife were killed in a car accident. According to the evidence, the husband probably lived longer than his wife. In their joint will, the spouses had a provision to the effect that, if they died simultaneously, their estate had to devolve in a certain way. The Court held that the words "gelyktydig te sterwe kom" (to die simultaneously) meant the death of the testators as the result of a single incident, irrespective of the fact that there was a difference in the exact time at which they died.

=== Transfer of rights and/or duties with regard to assets and/or the status of the deceased ===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}This ground rule is linked to the issue of ''dies cedit'' and ''dies venit''. The fact that there has to be a transfer of rights and/or duties with regard to the bequest and/or status of the deceased can also be regarded as a ground rule of the law of succession. Somebody must take the place of the deceased testator with regard to ownership of his assets, or in the case of customary law, with regard to status. In the case of the common law of succession, there is a transfer of rights (and sometimes also responsibilities) which belonged to the deceased.

In the case of the customary law of succession, the situation is more complicated. It depends on the type of property and the status of the deceased. In general, it can be said that succession to status positions takes place only after the death of a family head. Distinction is made between general succession (succession to the general status of the deceased) and special succession (succession to the position of the head of the various houses of the deceased). Although there have been exceptions to the rule, succession to status is mainly limited to male. Succession follows the rule of male primogeniture, which means that a family head is succeeded by his firstborn son of a particular house.

=== Beneficiary should at the time of ''dies cedit'' be alive or have been conceived ===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}The transfer of rights (and occasionally also responsibilities) is a prerequisite for succession. There must be somebody on whom the rights (or responsibilities) can devolve. Where a beneficiary has already died (is predeceased) when the bequeathed benefit vests, there can be no succession except if the deceased made provision in his or her will or antenuptial contract for the predecease of the beneficiary or in circumstances where ''ex lege'' substitution applies.

An exceptional situation is where a beneficiary has been conceived but not yet born when the bequeathed benefit vests. Since an unborn child is incapable of bearing rights and cannot inherit, the vesting of the bequest is held over until the child is born alive. This situation is referred to as the nasciturus fiction (a common law concept) in terms of which a child who survives birth is regarded as having obtained rights from the moment of conception, provided that conception took place before the death of the testator.

Customary law does not have a similar fiction, but some communities have customs that are meant to produce heirs for a husband after his death. ''Ukungena'', for example, is a custom which expects a widow to marry one of her husband's brothers after his death. If a man dies childless, the custom of ''ukungena'' allows for the continuation of his family line. Another custom, ''ukuvusa'', allows for the natural heir of the deceased (for example, his brother) to take the deceased's property and then to take a wife who will be regarded as the deceased's wife and whose children will be known as the deceased's children. It is, however, difficult to determine to what extent these customs are still followed by indigenous communities. In addition, the nasciturus fiction has been codified in the testate law of succession by section 2D(l)(c) of the Wills Act, which provides that any benefit allocated to the children of a deceased shall vest in such children as are alive at the time of the devolution of the benefit, or as have already been conceived at the time of the devolution of the benefit and who are later born alive.

=== Beneficiary must be competent to inherit ===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}The mere fact that somebody has been named as heir or legatee in a will, or in terms of the rules of intestate succession, does not necessarily mean that the person has the right to the relevant benefit. Although most persons are competent to inherit, there are some who do not have the competence to take up a benefit in terms of a specific will. There are also certain persons who are not competent to benefit intestate from a specific deceased.

In customary law, the competence of the beneficiary is often linked to the rule of male primogeniture. The customary rule of male primogeniture was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court in ''[[Bhe v Magistrate, Khayelitsha]]''. This case brought about fundamental changes to the customary law of succession and the administration of estates.

== Deceased estate ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}The aggregate of assets and liabilities of the deceased is termed the ''deceased estate''. The deceased estate is not a [[Legal personality|juristic person]]. Consequently, the only legal person in connection with the estate is the executor in his representative capacity. The estate ‘vests’ originally in the Master of the High Court, and subsequently in one or more executors, appointed by the Master, who bear the responsibility of administering the estate:

* first, by gathering in all the assets;
* next, by liquidating the deceased's liabilities; and
* lastly, by distributing the balance of the estate assets to the beneficiaries entitled thereto.

Due to this administration process, the estate does not initially vest in the heir. The executor becomes the legal ‘owner’ of the assets.&lt;ref&gt;It is expressly provided by the Deeds Registries Act that “owner” in relation to immovable property includes the legal representative of a deceased owner.&lt;/ref&gt; The executor, however, acquires the bare ''dominium'' only, and not the beneficial use and enjoyment of the assets. Similarly, the debts of the deceased are binding on the executor in his representative capacity only.

It follows that the executor alone can sue and be sued in respect of estate matters. Legal proceedings are brought or defended by the executor acting in a representative capacity, for the executor is the legal representative of the deceased. A legatee, for example, has no ''locus standi'' to claim from a third person assets which the former alleges to form part of the estate; still less does the heir acquire the ownership of the assets upon the death of the testator: The heir has merely a vested claim (personal right) against the executor, enforceable after confirmation of the liquidation and distribution account.

== Executor ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}The estates of all persons, whether dying testate or intestate, are administered and wound up by executors under letters of executorship granted to them by the Master of the High Court. If the deceased's will appoints specified persons as executors, the Master grants the letters to such persons; they are termed ''executors testamentary''.

Where no executors are appointed by will, and after consulting the heirs, the legatees and the creditors of the deceased, the Master appoints one or more persons as executors; they are termed ''executors dative''.

Executors testamentary who are conferred the power of assumption by a will may appoint co-executors; the latter are termed ''executors assumed''.

== Winding up ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}An estate is wound up when it has fallen into possession and is cleared of liabilities, and so left free for enjoyment by the beneficiaries. The executor's first duty is to gather in all the estate's assets in the possession of other persons, unless the Master of the High Court authorises such other persons to retain the property. Excluded from ingathering are life assurance benefits, retirement assets, and assets held in trust.

Debts due to the deceased include not merely pecuniary debts, but also any other obligations which can be specifically performed, such as an obligation to transfer land to the deceased. The executor may enforce such an obligation even if the deceased has died insolvent.

It is not the duty of an executor to realise the estate assets—that is, to turn them into money—unless the will directs him to do so, or unless it is necessary to raise money in order either to pay estate debts or to divide the assets properly among the beneficiaries. If empowered by the will, the executor may carry on the business of the testator, but without the authority of the court he may not pledge the credit of the estate in order to maintain it as a going concern.

=== Liquidation ===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}The next duty of the executor is to settle the liabilities against the deceased's estate, after satisfying himself that the estate is solvent, and after framing and lodging a liquidation and distribution account, to which there has been no valid objection, with the Master of the High Court within six months from the date of death.

An executor is liable in respect of any contractual obligation of the deceased which could have been enforced against him had he been alive, unless the obligation is of a personal nature or was clearly not intended by the parties to be transmissible. It follows that the executor must not only pay the pecuniary debts of the deceased, but must also perform obligations incurred by the deceased to transfer or to grant real rights in his property (like a sale of his land, or a contract to grant a servitude over his land, or a lease, or a mortgage).

The debts due by the estate include the deceased's obligation to maintain his spouse and minor children (and, in appropriate circumstances, even major children) if the benefits coming to them from the deceased's estate are insufficient to maintain them. Such a claim is preferent to the claims of heirs and, if the inheritances are insufficient, to the claims of legatees, but it cannot compete with the claims of normal creditors.

The executor is liable for the debts only to the extent of the assets in the estate. If the estate is solvent, the executor must pay the creditors as soon as funds sufficient for that purpose have been raised out of the estate, subject to there being no valid objection to his liquidation and distribution account. If the executor does not have sufficient free cash in hansets belonging to the estate in order to raise the necessary amount, but he may not sell assets bequeathed as legacies unless there are no other assets to meet the debts.

If the estate is insolvent, the executor must inform the creditors of this fact in writing; thereafter, provided he is instructed by a majority in number and value of all the creditors to surrender the estate under the Insolvency Act, he must realise and distribute the estate in terms of the procedure laid down for insolvent estates in the Administration of Estates Act.

=== Distribution ===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}After lodging a liquidation and distribution account to which there has been no objection, or any objections made have been overruled by the court, the executor must distribute the balance of the assets to the beneficiaries. Where there is no will, the assets are distributed among the heirs according to the rules of intestate succession; where there is a will, the assets are distributed according to the provisions of that will. In the latter case, the legacies are paid or distributed first, the balance going to the heirs; the consequence is that the heirs are in effect residuary legatees.

The distribution of the assets to the beneficiaries is effected:

* by transferring immovable property to them;
* by delivering movable property to them; or
* by paying money to them,

as the case may be. If a usufruct or other limited interest in immovable property has been bequeathed to any person, along with a direction that, upon the expiry of the interest, the property shall devolve upon some uncertain person, the executor must, instead of transferring the property, ensure that the terms of the will are endorsed against the title deeds. An endorsement is intended to safeguard the contingent rights of the uncertain persons; it does not vest the ownership or any other real right in them.

=== Beneficiaries’ title ===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}Under the [[Roman-Dutch law|Roman-Dutch]] system of [[universal succession]], the beneficiaries’ right to their portions of the deceased's assets was a real right, since the right was said to vest in the beneficiaries at the death of the deceased, without any formal delivery or transfer; so it was said that a real right is conferred on the beneficiaries, be they legatees or heirs.

However, after adoption of the English system of estate administration in the 19th century, the beneficiaries’ right to inherit is no longer absolute, nor is it assured. If the deceased's estate, after confirmation of the liquidation and distribution account, is found to be insolvent, none of the beneficiaries will obtain any assets at all. In the case of a legacy, the legatee will obtain the property bequeathed to him only:

# if the property belonged to the testator (for the will of one person cannot confer a real right in favour of another person over property belonging to a third person); and
# if the deceased's assets not left as legacies are sufficient to pay his debts.

In any event, an heir may not vindicate from a third person property which the heir alleges forms part of the deceased estate; only the executor has that power.

It follows from these considerations that an heir or legatee does not, upon the death of the testator, acquire the ownership of the assets; he merely has a vested claim (personal right) against the executor for payment, delivery or transfer of the property comprising the inheritance. This claim is enforceable only when the liquidation and distribution account has been confirmed. The heir or legatee, in fact, becomes owner of movable property only on its delivery, and of immovable property on its registration.

The modern position, therefore, is that a beneficiary has merely a personal right, ''ius in personam ad rem acquirendam'', against the executor; he does not acquire ownership by virtue of a will. The heir obtains ownership, or a lesser real right (such as a usufruct), only on delivery or transfer in pursuance of a testamentary disposition or intestate succession. Consequently, succession is merely a ''causa habilis'', or appropriate cause, for transfer of ownership.

==== Overpayment by executor ====
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}If an executor pays the heirs or legatees more than they were entitled to, there is [[Unjust enrichment|unjustified enrichtment]], so the executor may recover the excess from them by means of the ''[[condictio indebiti]]''. Similarly, an executor may reclaim from concurrent creditors an overpayment made to them if the estate is subsequently found to be insolvent.

==== Estate duty ====
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}By virtue of the Estate Duty Act, estate duty is payable on all property of a deceased person, and on all property which is deemed to be his property at the date of death.

=== Testamentary trustees ===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}The executor's duty is finished when the estate has been liquidated and distributed. Once the estate is distributed, the executor is entitled to be discharged as executor by the Master. Frequently, however, a will directs that the estate property or some portion of it must not be distributed immediately, but must be administered by some person, who is termed the testamentary “trustee” or “administrator.” It then becomes the duty of the executor to cause the terms of the will, insofar as they relate to the administration of the immovable property, to be endorsed against the title deeds of such immovable property.

The will usually, but not always, appoints the same persons as executors and as trustees. The functions of an executor and of a trustee are, however, quite separate and distinct. Further, the source of their authority is different. While the Master has the power of appointment of executors, a trustee's authority is derived from the will or some other document executed by the testator.

Where the executors are also appointed trustees, they first have to perform their duties as executors, and then as trustees. In the latter capacity, they have to administer and deal with the balance of the assets as directed by the will. The trustees must keep the assets properly invested, due regard being had to the production of fruits and the safety of the corpus of the estate.

A trustee must furnish security to the satisfaction of the Master for the due and faithful performance of his duties, unless he has been exempted from doing so by a court order or by the Master or in terms of the will. In the latter case, the Master may override the terms of the will and insist on security being furnished, if the Master is of the opinion that there are sound reasons for doing so.

== Collation ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}Collation is an obligation imposed by law on all descendants who wish to share as heirs in the estate of their ancestor, either by will or on intestacy. The obligation is to account to the estate for any gifts or advances received by them from their ancestor, or debts incurred to him, during his lifetime.

Collation is effected by adding to the inheritance the amount due by each heir. The new total is then divided among all the heirs. An heir cannot, as long as he refuses to collate, enforce legal remedies to claim his share of the inheritance.

The basis of collation is that a parent is presumed to have intended that there should be equality in the distribution of his estate among his children. Collation, however, may be dispensed with by the will of a testator, or waived by those entitled to the benefit thereof.

=== What property must be collated ===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}Among the classes of property which must be collated is property which has been given to a descendant

* as a portion of his inheritance;
* to start him in trade or business;
* as a dowry or marriage gift; or
* as a gift of a substantial nature resulting in inequitable treatment so far as the other children are concerned.

A descendant is expected to collate debts due by him to the ancestor, whether arising from contract, delict or any other source. This is the case even if the debt has prescribed by lapse of time, been extinguished under the provisions of the Agricultural Credit Act, or been discharged by the insolvency and the subsequent rehabilitation of the descendant.

Indeed, since the executor is obliged to recover all debts owing to the estate, for the benefit of creditors as well as beneficiaries, it is only debts that are not legally recoverable that should be collated. On the other hand, money spent on the maintenance of the descendant need not be collated; nor need money spent on his education, nor a simple and unconditional gift—provided that such expenditure is not substantial in relation to the ancestor's means and disproportionate to what other descendants have received.

=== Who is liable to collate ===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}The only persons liable to collate are descendants who are heirs on intestacy, or who are heirs under a will of an ancestor (provided that they would have been his heirs had there been no will); a hence a grandchild, whose father is alive, and who is an appointed heir under his grandfather's will, need not collate. If his father is dead, however, he must collate not only what he has received from his grandfather, but also amounts his father received.

Collation applies only to heirs who have adiated. If an inheritance is repudiated, the heirs who receive the inheritance by accrual will be required to collate what the repudiating heir would have had to collate.

Legatees and pre-legatees are not liable to collate unless the will provides to the contrary.

=== Who benefits from collation ===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}The only persons who may insist on collation, and share in the benefit thereof, are

* descendants who would themselves be under a duty to collate; and, possibly,
* a surviving spouse married to the deceased in community of property.

It follows, therefore, that legatees who are not obliged to collate, and the estate's creditors who can recover their debts in the ordinary course, cannot benefit from what is collated.

== Beneficiaries ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}

=== Heirs and legatees ===
The persons upon whom the testator's inheritance devolves are the called the beneficiaries. Beneficiaries may be divided into two categories:

* heirs; and
* legatees.

Anyone may be appointed as an heir or a legatee, including a natural person, a fixed or fluctuating class of persons, a company, a public corporation or a government department.

==== Heirs ====
An heir inherits

* the entire inheritance;
* a proportional part of it;
* a particular part of it; or
* the residue of the inheritance.

A testator may nominate one heir or many heirs. An heir may be nominated in a will or in an antenuptial contract. An heir may also inherit intestate.

==== Legatees ====
Legatees are beneficiaries in testate succession only. They inherit a specific or determinable asset (like a car) or a specified amount of money (exactly R10,000, for example). A legatee may be nominated only in a will or in an ante-nuptial contract. It is not possible for legatees to exist where the deceased died intestate.

A pre-legacy is a special bequest which has preference over all other bequests in terms of the testamentary instructions.

The testator may only bequeath his assets, or the assets of a third party, by means of a legacy.

A legacy will fail under the following circumstances:

* if the testator voluntarily alienates the subject-matter of a legacy during his lifetime, in which case it is said that the legacy fails through ademption;
* if the legatee dies before the legacy passes to him or her;
* in the event that the legatee repudiates;
* in the event that the legatee is unfit to inherit;
* if the bequeathed asset is destroyed; and
* if the legacy is made for a specific purpose, which purpose becomes impossible to execute.

==== Differences and similarities ====
The differences between heirs and legatees may be summarised as follows:

* Heirs occur in both testate and intestate succession; legatees occur only in testate succession.
* After the estate debts are paid, the executor must pay the legatees first. The legatees, therefore, have a better right and are in a stronger position than heirs.
* At common law, heirs are obliged to collate: that is, to return any benefit received during the currency of the testator's life, over and above reasonable support and maintenance. Legatees do not have this obligation.

=== Adiation and repudiation ===
Heirs and legatees have no obligation to receive an inheritance; they have the choice to accept or reject what has been bequeathed. In this context,

* adiation refers to the acceptance of a benefit; and
* repudiation (or renunciation) refers to the refusal to accept a benefit, or the rejection or renunciation thereof.

==== Adiation ====
Acceptance of a benefit under a will, generally referred to as “adiation,” is the act of a beneficiary in signifying an intention to take the benefit. A beneficiary is not obliged to accept a benefit under a will. However, if he accepts the benefit, he incurs any liability which may be involved in it. The general rule is that a person is assumed to have adiated unless he expressly repudiates. Nothing express or explicit is required by way of acceptance.

The acceptance of an unconditional benefit, therefore, is generally taken for granted, but not where the acceptance involves a liability, in which event the beneficiary has a choice or election whether to accept or to repudiate the benefit. For example, where the will leaves property to a person on condition that he or she pays a sum of money to another person, or that he or she gives another person some of his or her own property, or that he or she maintains and supports some other person.

The Wills Act provides that if any descendant of a testator, excluding a minor or mentally ill descendant, who together with the surviving spouse of the testator, is entitled a benefit in terms of the will, renounces his or her right to receive such a benefit, such benefit shall vest in the surviving spouse. Where the surviving spouse does not stand to inherit, and unless the will indicates otherwise, the renounced benefit must devolve on the descendants of that descendant per stirpes.

The effect of adiation is that the heir or legatee acquires a vested personal right against the executor for delivery of the asset once the estate has been liquidated.

==== Repudiation ====
The effect of repudiation is enunciated in the relevant provisions of the Wills Act and the Intestate Succession Act. The former provides as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If any descendants of a testator, excluding a minor or a mentally ill descendant, who, together with the surviving spouse of the testator, is entitled to a benefit in terms of a will renounces his right to receive such benefit, such benefit shall vest in the surviving spouse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If a descendant of the testator, whether as a member of a class or otherwise, would have been entitled to a benefit in terms of the provisions of a will if he had been alive at the time of death of the testator, or had not been disqualified from inheriting, or had not after the testator’s death renounced his right to receive such a benefit, the descendants of that descendant shall, subject to the provisions of subsection (1), ''per stirpes'' be entitled to the benefit, unless the context of the will otherwise indicates.&lt;ref&gt;s 2C(1)-(2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Intestate Succession Act contains the following provisions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a descendant of a deceased, excluding a minor or mentally ill descendant, who, together with the surviving spouse of the deceased, is entitled to a benefit from an intestate estate renounces his right to receive such a benefit, such benefit shall vest in the surviving spouse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If a person is disqualified from being an heir of the intestate estate of the deceased, or renounces his right to be such an heir, any benefit which he would have received if he had not been so disqualified or had not so renounced his right shall, subject to the provisions of subsection (6), devolve as if he had died immediately before the death of the deceased and, if applicable, as if he was not so disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;s 1(6)-(7).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Capacity to inherit ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}The general rule is that all persons, born or unborn, natural or juristic, and regardless of their general legal capacity—minor children, too, therefore—may take validly any benefit conferred on them by will or on intestacy. There are, however, various factors that may influence a beneficiary's capacity to inherit. Persons who have limited legal capacity are still capable of inheriting. However, their ability to enjoy their inheritance as they see fit is affected.

=== ''Nasciturus'' fiction ===
A conceived but unborn ''foetus'' (the ''nasciturus'') is not a legal subject, but the law takes into account the fact that, in the normal course of events, the ''foetus'' will one day ''become'' a legal subject. The ''nasciturus'' fiction states that, if an advantage accrues whilst a child, later born alive, is a foetus, he is deemed to have the requisite legal personality from the time that the benefit accrues.

The requirements for the ''nasciturus'' fiction are

* that the child have been conceived by the time the benefit accrues (the date of the death of the deceased);
* that the child subsequently be born alive; and
* that the fiction work to the advantage of the ''nasciturus''.

Intestate succession and division of assets are postponed until there is certainty as to whether the ''foetus'' is born alive or not, to see whether the ''nasciturus'' fiction is applied.

Testate succession looks at the intention of the testator:

* If the testator's intention shows specific beneficiaries, the ''nasciturus'' fiction will not apply.
* If it shows members of a class of persons, the ''nasciturus'' fiction will apply.

The fiction will apply unless it has been specifically excluded from the will.

The fiction has gained statutory recognition in the Wills Act.&lt;ref&gt;s 2D(1)(c).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adopted and extra-marital children ===
Adopted children are regarded, for all purposes, as the natural children of their adopted parents. The legal link between the child and his actual biological parents is severed, therefore.

Under the common law, extra-marital or illegitimate children were not qualified to inherit from their father's intestate estate, but could inherit from that of their mother. There is no longer any distinction between legitimate and extra-marital children; both are now in the same position.

=== Indignus ===
An indignus beneficiary (which is to say, an unworthy beneficiary) is precluded from inheriting because his conduct makes him unworthy, in a legal sense, to take a benefit from the deceased's estate. The basis for this ground of disqualification lies in the general principle that no-one may benefit from his own wrongdoing, or from conduct which the law regards as punishable. This principle is expressed by the maxim ''de bloedige hand neemt geen erf'' (the bloodied hand may not benefit). Unworthiness is not a general principle; an individual can only be unworthy in respect of a particular person or that person's ''conjunctissima'' (parent, spouse or child).

There are common-law and statutory grounds for disqualification that prevent beneficiaries from inheriting, and the courts have, over time, developed the law relating to these. Although the courts have recognised certain conduct as distasteful, the grounds of unworthiness are not limited. In consequence, and relying on prevailing values of public policy, new grounds of unworthiness may arise in the future. Instances where the courts have rendered a person unworthy to inherit are as follows:

Below are listed various categories of unworthy persons. It is not a closed list.

==== Fraud, duress and undue influence ====
A person may not inherit who, by fraud, duress or undue influence, has induced the testator to make a disposition in his or her favour. The amount of pressure which leads to the invalidity of a disposition on the ground of undue influence depends on various factors, such as the mental state of the testator and the relationship between the persons concerned.

==== Inducing immorality or degradation ====
A person who induces the deceased to lead an immoral or degrading lifestyle may not inherit either.

==== Unlawfully causing or contributing to the death of another ====
This can be either the intentional or negligent unlawful causing of death of another. At common law, somebody who has negligently caused the death of a deceased (of the testator's conjunctissimi) is also unworthy of inheriting from the deceased. It is evident, therefore, that unworthiness is not contingent on a criminal act.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[L Taylor v AE Pim]]'' 1903 NLR 484.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Casey v The Master]]'' 1992 (4) 505 (N).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ex parte Steenkamp and Steenkamp]]'' 1952 (1) SA 744 (T).&lt;/ref&gt;

Where, therefore, the deceased does not die immediately, and does not revoke a bequest conferred on the killer, the latter is still precluded from inheriting. It is an open question whether a person who has killed his spouse may claim the survivor's share in terms of the matrimonial property regime governing their marriage.

==== Justifiable homicide ====
A person is only disqualified if he caused the death of the deceased unlawfully and intentionally. If a person has successfully raised a defence of justifiable homicide, this is a full defence, and the accused is entitled to inherit from the deceased.

==== Perpetrator not criminally responsible ====
A person who is incapable of forming the necessary intention will not be regarded as being unworthy to inherit.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ex Parte Meier]]'' 1980 3 SA 154 (T).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gavin v Kavin]]'' 1980 (3) SA 1104 (W).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Forging, hiding or destroying a will ====
Forging, hiding or destroying a will is not only civil wrong (in that a person who does so will not be entitled to inherit); it is also a criminal wrong (in terms of section 102 of the Administration of Estates Act). A person is guilty of a crime, therefore, who steals, wilfully destroys, conceals, falsifies or damages a will, and may not inherit in terms of that will.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Pillay v Nagan]]'' 2001 (1) SA 410 (D).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pension benefits ====
A pension benefit is not considered to be an asset of a deceased estate. Pension benefits are dealt with outside the estate. The deceased may not bequeath these benefits to an heir or legatee. If pension benefits are due to the deceased, the trustees will decide to whom they are awarded. The ''bloedige hand'' principle has been extended to cover pension benefits.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Makhanya v Minister of Finance|Makhanya v Minister of Finance and Others]]'' 2001 (2) SA 1251 (D).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Insurance benefits ====
When taking out an insurance policy, one must nominate a beneficiary. The ''bloedige hand'' principle has been extended to cover insurance benefits.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Danielz v De Wet]]'' [2008] 4 All SA 549 (C).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Persons involved in executing a will ====
Section 4A(1) of the Wills Act disqualifies four categories of people form receiving a benefit from a will:

* a person who signs the will as a witness;
* person who signs the will as a proxy;
* a person who signs the will in the presence of and by the direction of the testator;
* a person who writes out the will or any part of it in his own handwriting; and
* the spouse of any of the above persons.

For the purposes of this provision, “any benefit” includes nomination as an executor, trustee or guardian. The rationale for such disqualifications is that they prevent fraud.

A beneficiary will not be disqualified, however, in the following circumstances:

* A court may declare a person or spouse competent to receive a benefit if it is satisfied that the testator was not defrauded or unduly influenced.
* If a person would have been entitled to receive a benefit in terms of intestate succession, he will not be disqualified, provided that the value of the benefit in terms of the will does not exceed what would have been received in terms of intestate succession.
* If a person who is entitled to receive a benefit in terms of the will has signed the will as a witness, along with two other competent witness who will not receive a benefit, that first person may inherit.

Section 4A does not apply where a beneficiary under a will witnesses a subsequent codicil made by the testator; similarly, a witness to a will may take a benefit under a subsequent codicil made by the testator.

==== Animals ====
Animals are not legal persons and, therefore, may not be beneficiaries in a will. When receiving a benefit, the heir must sign a receipt; obviously animals are unable to do so. Provision may be made for animals, however: trust funds to care for them, conditions that a person only inherits if they take care of the animal, etc.

=== Who inherits in the case of disqualification? ===
Where an heir who is a descendant of the testator, whether as a member of a class or otherwise, is disqualified from inheriting on any one of the grounds treated above, the benefit that he would have received devolves to his descendants per stirpes. This statutory rule is subject to there being no contrary intention in the will. It is implied that if the heir was NOT a descendant of the testator, then the benefit he/she would have received will NOT devolve upon his/her descendants per stirpes.

=== Customary law ===
Although the customary law of intestate succession has been abolished to a great extent by means of court judgments, there are customary law impediments influencing a beneficiary's capacity to inherit in terms of the customary law of succession. Cognisance must be taken of certain rules if a testator uses the principle of freedom of testation to stipulate in his or her will that the customary law of succession must apply.

== Intestate succession ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}Intestate succession takes place whenever the deceased leaves property which has not been disposed of by valid testamentary instrument. In other words, the law of intestate succession applies only:

* when the testator has left no valid will or testamentary disposition contained in a valid ''pactum successorium'' (e.g., antenuptial contract, donation ''mortis causa''); or
* when he leaves a will which fails for some or other reason.

Intestacy may be total (applying to the whole of the assets left by the deceased) or partial (applying to a portion only of his assets), for the deceased may die partly testate and partly intestate: for example, if the deceased bequeaths his car to his son but does not mention the rest of his estate.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Ex parte Stephens' Estate]]'' 1943 CPD 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intestacy is total when none of the assets are disposed of by a valid will: for example, where there is no will at all, or only a will which is void, or which has been revoked. Intestacy is partial when the deceased has left a valid will which, however, does not dispose of all his assets; in this event there is an intestacy as to the undisposed residue. This may happen in many circumstances: for example,

* where the will does not appoint an heir at all, but appoints only legatees, and a residue is left over after the liabilities and the legacies have been satisfied;
* where the appointed heir(s) fail to succeed;
* where an heir is appointed to a fractional portion of the estate only, and there is no other disposition of property;
* where heirs have been appointed, each to a fractional portion of the estate, and the disposition to one of them is a nullity, or one of them fails to succeed to his share.

Furthermore, intestacy can occur if certain conditions in an otherwise valid will are not fulfilled, or if benefits have been repudiated and no provision has been made for substitution, and accrual cannot take place.

=== History and sources ===
The law of intestacy was virtually codified by the Intestate Succession Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 81 of 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; which came into force on 18 March 1988. Before that, the South African system of intestate succession had to be construed from a variety of common-law and statutory rules. The law of intestate succession is rooted in the legislation of the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]]:  the Political Ordinance of 1 April 1580, as clarified and amended by the Interpretation Ordinance of 13 May 1594 and Section 3 of the Placaat of 18 December 1599.

In 1621 the ''Heeren XVII'' of the [[Dutch East India Company]] instructed the government of the [[Dutch East Indies]] to enforce these enactments, and the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] decreed them to be in force in [[Dutch Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] by the Octrooi of 10 January 1661, which was confirmed by Governor [[Maurits Pasques de Chavonnes|Pasques de Chavonnes]] on 19 June 1714.

The main common-law principles of intestacy were derived from a combination of two systems, somewhat in conflict, which prevailed prior to 1580 in the Netherlands: the ''aasdomsrecht'', the law of [[North Holland]] and [[Friesland]], which meant “the next in blood inherits the properties”, and the ''schependomsrecht'', the law of [[South Holland]] and [[Zeeland]], which meant “the properties return to the line whence they came”.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Schiltkamp, “On Common Ground: Legislation, Government, Jurisprudence, and Law in the Dutch West Indian Colonies in the Seventeenth Century”, ''A Beautiful and Fruitful Place: Selected Rensselaerwijck Papers'', vol. 2 (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2011), 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Under both systems, the property of an intestate person went to the deceased's blood relations only: in the first place, to his descendants; failing them, to his ascendants and collaterals. There were several important differences in the manner of devolution.

The 1580 Ordinance adopted the ''schependomsrecht'' distribution ''[[per stirpes]]'', restricting it in the case of collaterals to the fourth degree inclusive. Finally, the 1599 Placaat compromised between the two systems with respect to distribution, and gave one half of the estate to the surviving parent, and the other half to the descendants of the deceased parent.&lt;ref&gt;Grotius 2.28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Leeuwen CF 1.3.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The above laws conferred a right of succession on intestacy on the deceased's blood relations, but none on a surviving spouse or an adopted child, and furthermore restricted the intestate succession rights of the extra-marital child. Because marriage in community of property was the norm, such a spouse ''ipso facto'' took half of the joint estate.

Initially, the word ''spouse'' in the Intestate Succession Act was restrictively interpreted to mean only those spouses who had contracted a marriage in terms of the Marriage Act.&lt;ref&gt;Act 25 of 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation has since been extended by case law, in recognition of the modern perception that there is a need to protect the interests of surviving spouses. The common law, as derived from the two different systems that applied in Holland, has been adapted on numerous occasions by legislation. The most important such legislation was probably the Succession Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 13 of 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of which the surviving spouse, whether married in or out of community, was granted a right to a share in the intestate estate of the deceased spouse.

The Intestate Succession Act of 1987&lt;ref&gt;Act 81 of 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; instituted a much simpler system of intestate succession, revoking common-law rules and all statutory adaptations in their entirety. The Intestate Succession Act, together with the Children's Act, extended the categories of persons who may be heirs who take in intestacy. For example, all natural persons, irrespective of whether they are adopted or extra-marital, or conceived by [[artificial insemination]], or born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement, nowadays have the capacity to inherit.

The Intestate Succession Act applies, except as explained below, in all cases where a person dies wholly or partially intestate after March 18, 1988. Under the Act, the surviving spouse and the adopted child are heirs of the deceased. The historical discrimination visited on extra-marital children has disappeared. The position of adopted children is now dealt with in the Child Care Act.&lt;ref&gt;Act 74 of 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, the application of the Intestate Succession Act was regulated on a racial basis. Certain intestate estates of African people were distributed according to the "official customary law," as entrenched in the Black Administration Act and its regulations, while the Intestate Succession Act applied to the rest of the population. The Black Administration Act, and the Regulations passed thereunder, provided that the estates of black people who died without leaving a valid will sometimes devolved according to “Black law and custom.” This meant, inter alia, that the reforms introduced by the Intestate Succession Act did not apply to spouses married in terms of African customary law. As far as children were concerned, the parallel system of African customary law of succession perpetuated discrimination against adopted, extra marital and even female children.

This racial disparity in the treatment of spouses and children disappeared when the Constitutional Court, in ''[[Bhe v Magistrate, Khayelitsha]]'', extended the provisions of the Intestate Succession Act retrospectively, as from April 27, 1994, to all intestate heirs, irrespective of race.

While the Intestate Succession Act is important, one cannot discount case law when determining the rules of intestate succession. If and when the RCLSA is promulgated into law, it, too, will be relevant for determining South Africa's intestate-succession laws.

=== Computation of kinship ===

==== Blood relations ====
* '''Descendants''' are persons who descend directly from another person, such as children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc.
* '''Ancestors''' are persons from whom the person is directly descended, like parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, etc.
* '''Ascendants''' are ancestors and collaterals.
* '''Collaterals''' are relatives descended from the deceased's ancestors but not in the direct line of descent, i.e., neither ancestors nor descendants—such as siblings, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews, etc.
**Collaterals can be full- or half-blooded. A full-blood collateral has two ancestors in common with a person; a half-blood collateral has only one. A sister, therefore, is a full-blood collateral—she has both parents in common with her sibling—but a half-sister is only a half-blood collateral, since she has only one parent in common. If, in other words, Boucher and Cronje are descendants of Abel—that is, if Abel is an ancestor of Boucher and Cronje—Boucher and Cronje are full-blood collaterals.
**Collaterals can be first-, second- or third-line. First-line collaterals are the descendants of the deceased's parents, i.e., the deceased's siblings and nieces and nephews. Second-line collaterals are the issue of the grandparents not including the parents, which includes uncles and aunts, and first cousins. Likewise, third-line collaterals are the issue of great-grandparents not including grandparents and parents, and so on.

==== Distribution scheme ====
[[File:Stirpes.png|thumb|150px|right|'''Three ''stirpes''.''' B is a ''stirpes'', as he is a surviving descendant of A. C and E are both ''stirpes'', as they are survived by descendants. F is not a ''stirpes'', as he is not survived.]]
[[File:Stirpes2.png|thumb|150px|right|'''Two ''stirpes''.''' C is a ''stirpes'', as he is a surviving descendant of A. D is a ''stirpes'', because he is survived by a descendant. In other words, although D and H are both deceased, D is survived by his grandchild; therefore it is D who is the ''stirpes'', not I.]]
[[File:Representation.png|thumb|100px|left|If B is unworthy to inherit, or if he chooses not to, F and G may represent B in order to inherit.]]
South Africa uses the [[Roman-Dutch law|Roman-Dutch]] parentelic system to reckon kinship and determine distribution in intestacy. The term '''''parentela''''' refers to a particular parental group and its descendants:

* First ''parentela'' consists of the deceased and his descendants.
* Second ''parentela'' consists of the deceased's parents and their descendants (first-line collaterals).
* Third ''parentela'' consists of the deceased's grandparents and their descendants (second-line collaterals).
* Fourth ''parentela'' consists of great-grandparents and their descendants (third-line collaterals).

And so the ''parentelae'' go on. Essentially, the lowest ''parentela'' wins and takes the entire estate, and parentelic heads trump others within the same ''parentela''.

A '''''stirp''''' may be translated literally as a branch. In the present context, therefore, it includes the surviving child of a deceased, as well as a predeceased child survived by descendants.

When determining how many ''stirpes'' there are, one should pay attention to the immediate descendants of the deceased and then see if they are alive or if their descendants are alive.

'''Representation''' arises when an heir cannot, or does not wish to, inherit from the deceased. In this case, the descendants of the heir may represent the heir to inherit.

=== Effect of [[Matrimonial regime|marital regime]]s ===
If the deceased is married at the time of his death, the property system that applies to his marriage is of utmost importance since it affects the distribution of the deceased's estate. In terms of the Recognition of Matrimonial Property Act, the first marriage of a male with more than one wife is always considered to be in [[Community property|community of property]]. If a second marriage is entered into, the parties must enter into an antenuptial contract, which will regulate the distribution of the estate.

Essentially, there are four forms of marital regimes recognised by the courts:

# community of property ([[Afrikaans|Afrik]] ''gemeenskap van goed'');
# community of profit and loss (Afrik ''gemeenskap van wins en verlies'');
# separation of property (Afrik ''skeiding van goed''); and
# the accrual system (Afrik ''aanwasbedeling'').

With regard to marriages in community of property or in community of profit and loss, the surviving spouse automatically succeeds to half of the joint estate (''communio bonorum''); the remaining half devolves according to the rules of intestate succession.

With regard to marriages in separation of property,&lt;ref&gt;Statutory language: “out of community of property and not subject to accrual”&lt;/ref&gt; the entire estate devolves according to the rules of intestate succession.

With regard to the accrual system,&lt;ref&gt;Statutory language: “out of community of property but with accrual”&lt;/ref&gt; where one spouse's estate shows no or lesser accrual than that of the other spouse, the lesser-accruing spouse has a claim for an amount equal to half of the difference between the two net accrued estates. The equalization payment must be dealt with first as a claim against or in favour of the estate. The balance thereafter must devolve according to rules of intestate succession.

If a husband has an estate of R100,000 at the start of his marriage, and R200,000 at the end of the marriage, R100,000 will have accrued. If his wife, at the start of her marriage, has an estate worth R50,000, and at the end of the marriage worth R100,000, the amount accrued will be R50,000. If the husband dies, the difference in the accrual of both estates is R50,000; therefore the wife has a claim for half of the accrued amount:  R25,000. Thereafter the remainder of the estate will devolve in terms of the rules of intestate succession.

=== Vesting of intestate-succession rights ===
The question of who in fact the heirs are is normally determined as at the date of the death of the deceased. Where, however, the deceased leaves a valid will which takes effect on his death, but subsequently fails, either wholly or in part, the intestate heirs are determined as at the date on which it first became certain that the will had failed.

=== Order of succession on intestacy ===
Section 1(1)(a) to (f) of the Intestate Succession Act contains the provisions in terms of which a person's estate is to be divided. In terms of this section, there are ten categories which indicate who will inherit. Section 1(2) to (7) contains certain related provisions.

==== Spouse only, no descendants ====
Where the deceased is survived by a spouse, but not by a descendant, the spouse inherits the intestate estate. “Spouse” includes

* a person married to the deceased in accordance with Muslim rites;
* a person married to the deceased in terms of African Customary Law; and
* a partner in a permanent same-sex life partnership in which the partners have undertaken reciprocal duties of support.

==== No spouse and only descendants ====
[[File:Inheritance per stirpes by representation.png|thumb|100px|right|The estate is worth R300,000. A, B and C will each receive R100,000.]]
[[File:No Spouse and Only Descendants.png|thumb|100px|right|The estate is worth R300,000. B and C will each receive R100,000. D and E will each receive R50,000 (A's one-third share divided equally).]]
Where the deceased is survived by a descendant, but not by a spouse, the descendant inherits the intestate estate. The estate is divided into as many equal portions as there are surviving children and deceased children who leave descendants. Each surviving child takes one share, termed a “child’s share,” and the share of each deceased child is divided equally among his surviving children and each group of descendants of a deceased child. This process is known as representation per stirpes; it continues ad infinitum.

An adopted child is deemed, for all purposes, to be the legitimate child of its adoptive parent. An order of adoption terminates all rights and obligations existing between the child and its natural parents (and their relatives). It follows that an adopted child inherits upon the intestacy of its adoptive parents and their relatives, but not upon the intestacy of its natural parents and their relatives.

Under Roman-Dutch law, an illegitimate or extra-marital child inherited upon the intestacy of its mother, but not of its father. This limitation on the capacity of the extra-marital child to inherit on intestacy has been swept away by the Intestate Succession Act, which provides that, in general, illegitimacy shall not affect the capacity of one blood relation to inherit the intestate estate of another blood relation. Illegitimacy arising from incest, too, no longer presents a problem. Furthermore, as noted earlier, the tenuous position of extra-marital children under African customary law of succession, too, has been removed by making the Intestate Succession Act applicable to all children.

==== Spouse and descendants ====
[[File:Spouse and Descendants.png|thumb|100px|right|The estate is worth R400,000. There are three children; therefore, one should divide the entire estate by four (three children plus one) to calculate a child's share. A child's share is thus R100,000. Because the spouse inherits the greater of R125,000 and a child's share, the spouse in this example will inherit R125,000. The remaining R275,000 is then divided equally between the children. Thus each child will receive R91,666.67. If the estate is worth less than R125,000, the spouse will inherit everything.]]
Where the deceased is survived by one spouse, as well as by a descendant, the surviving spouse inherits whichever is the greater of

* a child's share; and
* an amount fixed from time to time by the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development (presently R250,000).

The descendant or descendants inherit the residue (if any) of the intestate estate.

To calculate a child's share, the estate is divided into as many children's shares as stated above, plus an additional share, which the surviving spouse takes.

Where the deceased is survived by more than one spouse, a child's share in relation to the intestate estate of the deceased is calculated by dividing the monetary value of the estate by a number equal to the number of children of the deceased who have either survived or predeceased the deceased, but who are survived by their descendants, plus the number of spouses who have survived the deceased. Each surviving spouse inherits whichever is the greater of

* a child's share;
* an amount fixed from time to time by the Minister (presently R250 000).

The descendant or descendants inherit the residue (if any) of the intestate estate. Where the assets of the deceased are not sufficient to provide for each spouse with the amount fixed by the Minister, the estate is divided between the surviving spouses.

The share inherited by a surviving spouse is unaffected by any amount to which he or she might be entitled in terms of the matrimonial-property laws.

==== No spouse, no descendants; both parents survive the deceased ====
Where the deceased leaves neither a spouse nor a descendant, but is survived

* by both his parents, they inherit the intestate estate in equal shares; or
* by one of his parents, the surviving parent inherits one half of the intestate estate and the descendants of the deceased parent the other half, unless there are no such descendants, in which case the surviving parent inherits the entire estate.

In relation to the descendants of a parent of the deceased, division of the estate takes place per stirpes. Representation is allowed ad infinitum.

==== No spouse, no descendants; only one parent survives; deceased parent leaves descendants ====
In this case, the surviving parent will inherit half of the estate, and the descendants of the deceased parent will inherit the residue ''per stirpes'' by representation.
[[File:No Spouse and No Descendants and Only One Parent Survives and the Deceased Parent Leaves Descendants.png|thumb|100px|right|X is the deceased in question. His estate is worth R300,000. F will receive his half share of R150,000. M is the deceased mother, so her half-share will be divided equally between her descendants. Therefore, C and A will each receive R75,000.]]
In this case, the surviving parent is the sole heir.

==== No spouse, no descendants, no parents; both parents leave descendants ====
[[File:No Spouse and No Descendants and No Parents but Both Parents Leave Descendants.png|thumb|100px|right|X is the deceased in question. His estate is worth R300,000. Half of the estate goes through M and the other half through F, as they are the parents of the deceased. Y, Q, A and B will receive R37,500 each through F's line, as they are all descendants of F (R150 000 divided by four). A and B will receive R75,000 each through M's line, as they are both descendants of M (R150 000 divided by two). Thus overall Y and Q will receive R37,500 each, while A and B will receive R112,500 each (R37,500 plus R75,000).]]
Where the deceased is not survived by a spouse or descendant or parent, but is survived by descendants of his parents (by a brother or sister, for example, whether of the full or half blood), the intestate estate is divided into halves, one half going to the descendants of the deceased father by representation, the other half to the descendants of the deceased mother. The full brothers and sisters of the deceased consequently take a share in both halves of the estate, while the half-brothers and -sisters take a share in one half only of the estate. If, however, all the surviving descendants are related to the deceased through one parent alone, such descendants inherit the entire estate. Thus, for example, if there are no full brothers or sisters, but merely a half-brother of the deceased on his mother's side, the half-brother will take the whole estate to the exclusion of more remote relatives such as grandparents, uncles or aunts.

==== No spouse, no descendants, no parents; one parent leaves descendants ====
[[File:No Spouse and No Descendants and No Parents but One Parent Leaves Descendants.png|thumb|100px|right|A and B will inherit the entire estate in equal shares.]]
In this case, the descendants of the parents will inherit the entire estate in equal shares. The descendants inherit ''per stirpes'' by representation.

==== No spouse, no descendants, no parents, no descendants of the parents ====
[[File:No spouse, no descendants, no parents, no descendants of the parents.png|thumb|100px|right|E dies intestate. E's spouse (V), mother (M), father (P), brother (A) and grandfather (C) predeceased him. E is survived by his grandmother (B), great-grandmother (D and great-grandfather (F). Who inherits E's estate? Look to the people still alive: B is related to E in two degrees; D and F are related to E in three degrees. Since the nearest blood relative is the one who inherits, B will inherit everything from E.]]
Where the deceased is not survived by a spouse, descendant, parent, or a descendant of a parent, the other blood relations of the deceased who are related to him nearest in degree inherit the estate in equal shares (per capita). The degree of relationship between the parties is,

* in the direct line, the number of generations between the deceased and the ancestor or descendant (as the case may be); and,
* in the collateral line, the number of generations between the blood relation and the nearest common ancestor, plus the number of generations between that common ancestor and the deceased.

A parent or child of the deceased would thus be related to him in the first degree, a grandparent or grandchild in the second degree, an uncle or aunt in the third degree, and so on.

==== No spouse or living blood relatives ====
If there are no relations of the deceased, by blood or by adoption, and no surviving spouse, the fiscus or State is entitled, after the lapse of thirty years, to claim the estate as bona vacantia (unclaimed property) in terms of the common law. The authority for this is the case of ''[[Estate Baker v Estate Baker]]''. In these circumstances the State is not an “heir,” and the estate is not “inherited.” It merely accrues to the State.

=== Disqualification and renunciation ===
The Law of Succession Amendment Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 43 of 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; which came into operation on October 1, 1992, amended the Intestate Succession Act as regards the rules for the disqualification of and the renunciation by an intestate heir of his inheritance. If a person is disqualified from being an intestate heir of the deceased, the benefit which the heir would have received had the heir not been disqualified, devolves as if the heir had died immediately before the death of the deceased, and as if the heir had not been disqualified from inheriting.

Where an heir who stands to inherit along with the surviving spouse (provided that that heir is not a minor or mentally ill) renounces his or her intestate benefit, such benefit vests in the surviving spouse. Where there is no surviving spouse, the benefit devolves as if the descendant had died immediately before the death of the deceased.

=== Customary law ===
Section 23 of the Black Administration Act stated that, when African persons died intestate, their estates devolved in terms of the rules of primogeniture. Women and children, therefore, were excluded from inheriting under this Act. The case of ''[[Bhe v The Magistrate, Khayelitsha]]'' changed this by striking down section 23 as unconstitutional.

There is a statute not yet in force (the Reform of Customary Law of Succession and Regulation of Related Matters Act) which states that the estates of persons subject to customary law who die intestate will devolve in terms of the Intestate Succession Act. This Act thus modifies the customary-law position.

A testator living under a system of customary law may still use his or her freedom of testation to stipulate that the customary law of succession must be applicable to his or her estate. In such a case, it would be necessary to apply the customary law of succession to the deceased estate.

If the customary law of succession is applicable, it is important to distinguish between the order of succession in a monogamous and polygynous household.

=== Intestate succession and Muslim marriages ===
Persons married in terms of Muslim rites are not recognised in South African law as “spouses” proper. All references, therefore, to “spouses” in the Intestate Succession Act do not apply. The courts in ''[[Daniels v Campbell]]'' and ''[[Hassam v Jacobs]]'', however, have held that persons married in terms of Muslim rites may inherit as if they were spouses proper.

=== Intestate succession and Hindu marriages ===
Persons married in terms of Hindu rites are not recognised in South African law as “spouses” proper. All references to “spouses” in the Intestate Succession Act accordingly do not apply. The court in the case of ''[[Govender v Ragavayah]]'', however, held that persons married in terms of Hindu rites may inherit as if they are spouses proper.

=== Intestate succession and permanent same-sex life partnerships ===
Before the Civil Union Act, partners in a permanent same-sex life partnership were not allowed to marry, and so could not inherit from each other intestate. The case of ''[[Gory v Kolver]]'' changed this position, with its finding that such partners could inherit intestate.

There is a proposed amendment to section 1 of the Intestate Succession Act, which will include partners in a permanent same-sex life partnership in which the partners have undertaken reciprocal duties of support in the definition of “spouse.” The amendment of the Act, it has been argued, is ill-advised. The memorandum to the Amendment Bill cites Gory v Kolver as authority, but it has been suggested that the situation which prevailed at the time that this case was heard no longer exists, due to the advent of the Civil Union Act. The decision in Gory v Kolver case was predicated on the fact that the parties were not able to formalise their relationship in any way. On the evidence, the parties had undertaken mutual duties of support. Had it been possible for them to do so, they would almost certainly have formaised their relationship. Were the parties in that situation presently, they would have the option of formalising their relationship under the Civil Union Act. The survivor would be considered a "spouse" for the purposes of the Intestate Succession Act. The net effect of the proposed amendment, it has been argued, is that it elevates same-sex partnerships to a level superior to that of heterosexual life partnerships.

It has been suggested that the proposed Domestic Partnership Bill will address the concerns of parties to a same-sex or heterosexual relationship insofar as intestate succession is concerned. More importantly, both types of relationship (same-sex and heterosexual) will be on an equal footing under the proposed Domestic Partnership Bill. This arguably would not be the case if the proposed amendment to the Intestate Succession Act were signed into law.

Furthermore, the memorandum to the amendment Bill states that the proposed amendment limits the application of the clause to cases where the court is satisfied that the partners in question were not able to formalise their relationship under the Civil Union Act. The question remains, however: What exactly would these circumstances be?

=== Intestate succession and permanent heterosexual life partnerships ===
It is trite that the survivor of a heterosexual life partnership enjoys no benefits as a spouse under the Intestate Succession Act; nor may the survivor of a heterosexual life partnership claim maintenance from the deceased estate in terms of the Maintenance of Surviving Spouses Act.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Volks v Robinson]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Draft Domestic Partnerships Bill seeks to address those persons who do not wish to marry but who still want to formalise their partnerships. Section 20 of the Bill states that the definition of "spouse" in section 1 of the Intestate Succession Act will include a registered domestic partner.

Section 26 of the Bill also provides that an unregistered domestic partner may apply for an order for intestate succession, and that the court will take into account, ''inter alia'',

* the duration and nature of the relationship;
* the nature and extent of the common residence;
* the financial interdependence of the parties;
* the care and support of children of the parties; and
* the performance of household duties.

The Bill does not make the relationship between the parties a "marriage" or a "civil union" proper; it merely allows for the registration of the partnership.

== Testate succession ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}Testamentary succession takes place by virtue of either a will or a codicil:

* A will or testament is a declaration, in proper form, by a person known as the “testator” or “testatrix,” as to how and to whom his or her property is to go after his or her death.
* A codicil is a second or later will, either annexed to the original will or in a separate document. It is usually employed to supplement and to make alterations to the original will. By virtue of the Wills Act, a codicil is included within the definition of “will.”

The date of execution of a will is the date on which the will is signed. Before 1954, when the Wills Act came into force, all provinces had their own legislation regulating the law of testate succession; now the Wills Act has uniformed the law in this regard.

When dealing with a will which may have been executed under suspicious circumstances, it is important to investigate whether the testator wanted to execute a will and whether he or she did so freely.

Once these requirements have been fulfilled, and once it has been established that the formalities have been complied with, the executor is appointed. He has to deal with the general winding-up of the estate.

Adiation and repudiation form the basis of succession, as it is important to know whether a beneficiary adiates or repudiates a benefit before the executor can begin with the final liquidation and distribution of an estate.

=== Freedom of testation ===
Freedom of testation is the power a testator has to deal with his property as he desires. A cardinal principle of South African law is that all persons have complete freedom of testation; no person is obliged to bequeath his estate to anyone.&lt;ref&gt;There are, however, some jurisdictions abroad which require a percentage of the deceased estate to go to the spouse of the deceased.&lt;/ref&gt; A clause in a will, or an agreement which seeks to limit a testator's freedom to dispose of his property on death, is unenforceable.

Freedom of testation is not absolute, however. It is subject to limitations imposed by statute and the common law. While a testator is generally permitted to disinherit his spouse and his children, and is free to impose conditions on beneficiaries regarding how they should enjoy an inheritance, or when a benefit is to vest, there are instances when, as a matter of public policy, the law restrains testators in their exercise of this freedom. The Constitution also has a role to play here.

Nowadays, a testator living under customary law also has freedom of testation regarding customary-law property.

==== Limitations ====
While testators in South Africa enjoy a wide freedom of testation, this freedom is subject to certain limitations. These limitations can be divided into statutory and common law limitations and include conditions that interfere with a beneficiary's marital relationship and conditions limiting a beneficiary's freedom of movement. The common-law limitations are also entrenched in the Constitution. Certain indirect limitations, such as those imposed by the maintenance of children and the Maintenance of Surviving Spouses Act, may also be found.

===== Illegal dispositions and those against public policy =====
No effect is given to illegal dispositions. If, for example, the testator leaves money to set up a brothel, no effect will be given to this disposition, since its purpose is an illegal one.

Effect is also not given to those dispositions which are against public policy.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Minister of Education v Syfrets Trust]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Subdivision of agricultural land =====
It was custom that, when Dutch people died, they gave their agricultural land to their sons in equal shares. This led, however, to the fragmentation of farms, which eventually became so small that they were no longer viable. In terms of section 3 of the Subdivision of Agricultural Land Act, therefore, the testator's capacity to subdivide his land has been limited.

To get around this legislation, a testator may leave the land to a trust or close corporation, and appoint the beneficiaries as beneficiaries of the trust or close corporation in equal shares.

===== Subdivision of mineral rights =====
The subdivision of mineral rights is based on the same principle as the subdivision of agricultural land. Therefore, in terms of section 20 of the Mineral Rights Act, a testator cannot bequest mineral rights in undivided shares to more than one person.

===== Successive ''fideicommissa'' =====
A ''fideicommissa'' occurs

* where a benefit is left to one person (the fiduciary); and
* where, after a period of time or after fulfilment of a condition, the benefit then goes to another person (the fideicommissary).

With regard to movable property, there may be an infinite number of fideicommissaries. There may be any number of fideicommissaries. Family heirlooms, for example, are sometimes passed on to the eldest daughter of the testator; when she dies, they are passed on to her oldest daughter; and so on, in perpetuity.

Where, however, there is fixed property that is the subject of a ''fideicommissa'', only two successive fideicommissaries are permitted. If, for example, certain land is left to the eldest son of the testator and, when he dies, on to his eldest son, and upon his death to ''his'' eldest son, this is the furtherest the property can go in terms of the ''fideicommissa''. The second ''fideicommissa'' may bequeath the land to whomever he wishes.

===== Maintenance of surviving spouse =====
There is no general duty on the testator to leave anything to his surviving spouse. The Maintenance of Surviving Spouses Act was passed to provide a remedy for surviving spouses. In terms of section 2 of this Act, the surviving spouse has a claim against the deceased estate for reasonable maintenance until her death or remarriage, provided that she is unable to support herself.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Daniels v Campbell''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 3 of the Act states the factors to be considered in determining the amount of maintenance awarded, in addition to any other factor:

* the amount in the estate of the deceased spouse available for distribution to heirs and legatees;
* the existing and expected means, earning capacity, financial needs and obligations of the survivor;
* the subsistence or duration of the marriage;
* the standard of living of the survivor during the subsistence of the marriage; and
* the age of the survivor at the death of the deceased spouse.

===== Maintenance and education of minor children =====
In terms of the common law, every minor child of a deceased parent has a claim for maintenance and education against the deceased estate.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Estate Visser'' 1948 (3) SA 1129 (C).&lt;/ref&gt; This duty does not cease when the child attains majority; it runs until the child is self-supporting. It is also irrelevant that the child is legitimate or illegitimate.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Carelse v Estate De Vries]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

If there are insufficient funds in the deceased estate to cover the total maintenance and education of minor children, the children will receive a ''pro rata'' amount.

The child's right to claim for maintenance and education has preference over all heirs and legatees,&lt;ref&gt;''Hoffmann v Herdan NO'' 1982 (2) SA 274 (T).&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore must be determined first.

The duty to support is passed on from the parent to his estate when he dies, and so it cannot be bequeathed.

With regard to the maintenance of parents, there is no law providing for this yet. If, however, the parent of a deceased child can show the need for it, it is possible that such a claim may be successful.

===== Pension funds =====
In terms of the Pension Funds Act, pension funds do not accrue to the deceased estate. It is the board of trustees of the particular pension fund which decides to whom to allocate the money. (This is usually the spouse or the children depending on the circumstances.) The testator therefore cannot bequeath his pension funds to an heir or legatee.

==== Delegation ====
The testator may also delegate his or her freedom of testation to a certain extent by conferring the power of appointment upon other persons.

==== Customary law ====
A person living under a system of customary law is free to make a will regarding customary property. The principles regarding power of appointment should, however, be kept in mind in such instances.

=== Testamentary capacity ===
In order to make a will, the testator must have testamentary capacity. If he does not have such capacity at the time the will is executed—that is to say, at the time it is signed—the will is void ''ab initio'', and thus is deemed to never have been valid.

The Wills Act deals with the formal capacity to make a will. Section 4 of the Wills Act states that a person has formal capacity to make a will if he is

* at least sixteen years of age; and,
* at the time of making the will, mentally capable of appreciating the nature and effect of his act. If, however, a person who has been declared mentally defective makes a will during a lucid interval, it is valid.

Testamentary capacity, then, refers to the minimum age and the mental capacity required to make a valid will.&lt;ref&gt;See s 4 of the Wills Act.&lt;/ref&gt; The burden of proof in this regard rests on the party alleging formal incapacity. Evidence concerning a testator's mental capabilities is taken into account when determining the validity of a will.

The Master of the High Court will accept without evidence that the will that he receives from the executor was executed with the necessary testamentary capacity. The issue of a testator's testamentary capacity will only arise if someone approaches a court with an application regarding the capacity of the testator to make a will. The Master determines only whether the formal requirements of the will have been met; he does not concern himself with the other formalities regarding capacity.

It is important to distinguish testamentary capacity from the testator's free expression of his will (volition) as well as from freedom of testation.

If the alleged testator is under sixteen years, he is absolutely prohibited from making a will, even with the assistance of a parent or guardian. Such a will is void ''ab initio'' and thus cannot be ratified at a later date. If the testator is at least sixteen years, this is one of the few legal undertakings a minor can assume.

Minors who are entitled to make wills may do so without the authority or assistance of their parents or guardians. The common-law restriction placed on deaf-mutes and interdicted prodigals from making wills is not part of modern South African law.

Under a system of customary law, people have freedom of testation just like anyone else and also need to comply with the requirements of testamentary capacity.

==== Mental ability of the testator ====
As stated in section 4 of the Wills Act, the testator must have the requisite mental ability. There is a rebuttable presumption that the testator is competent. Incompetence would result from the will's being executed by a person who suffers from a mental illness or is under the influence of alcohol or drugs (both legal and illegal) at the time of execution, if that person is incapable of understanding the nature and effect of what he is doing. This obviously depends on the circumstances of each case.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Geldenhuys v Borman]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harlow v Becker]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Undue influence on the testator ====
If there is undue influence exerted on the testator (physical, mental or otherwise), the testator will lack the requisite capacity. The will will be declared invalid.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Spies v Smith]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kirsten v Bailey]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capacity to witness a will ===
Every person of the age of fourteen years or more who is not incompetent to give evidence in a court of law is competent to witness a will.

=== Formalities for execution of a will ===
A will is a unilateral expression of the wishes of a testator in a legally prescribed manner which determines what must happen to his or her property after his or her death. The Wills Act defines a will to “include a codicil and any other testamentary writing.” The only way in which a testator can make a valid will is by strictly complying with the detailed requirements of section 2(1) of the Wills Act.

The will must be in writing, so a video will shall not suffice, as it provides no signature, and the potential for fraud is too great. An electronic will—that is, a will stored on a computer hard drive or other data-storage device—may be condoned, although invalid, in terms of section 2(3) of the Wills Act.

Furthermore, it is not necessary for the date or place of execution to be recorded, but for practical reasons it is recommended: for example, if a series of wills are executed revoking previous ones.

Similar execution requirements apply when the testator amends an existing will by making changes on the will itself. A codicil that amends an existing will must also be made in accordance with the requirements of section 2(1) of the Wills Act.

==== Requirements for a testamentary disposition ====
The four requirements for a testamentary disposition are

* compliance with statutory formalities (i.e. the Wills Act);
* a description of the property bequeathed;
* the extent of the interest in the property bequeathed; and
* the identity of the beneficiary.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Ex Parte Estate Davies]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Methods of executing a valid will ====
Accordingly, there are five methods by which the testator may execute a valid will:

# The testator signs the will in the presence of two witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;s 2(1)(a)(i), read with s 2(1)(a)(ii).&lt;/ref&gt; All three people (the testator and the two witnesses) must be in the same place at the same time, as all three sign the will.
# The testator acknowledges in the presence of two witnesses his signature previously placed on the will.&lt;ref&gt;s 2(1)(a)(ii).&lt;/ref&gt; The testator is merely to acknowledge in the presence of the witnesses that he signed the will earlier, and that the signature on the will is his.
# Someone else signs on behalf of the testator in the presence of two witnesses and it is certified by a commissioner of oaths.&lt;ref&gt;s 2(1)(a)(i) read with s 2(1)(a)(ii) and (v).&lt;/ref&gt; Schedule 1 of the Act contains a certificate which must be completed by a commissioner of oaths stating the identity of the testator and that it is in fact the testator's last will and testament.
# Someone else signs on behalf of the testator and acknowledges in the presence of two witnesses his signature previously placed on the will which is then certified by a commissioner of oaths.&lt;ref&gt;s 2(1)(a)(ii) read with s 2(1)(a)(v).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the testator may sign the will himself either before or in the presence of the witnesses, or another person may sign on behalf of the testator either before or in the presence of the witnesses, provided the will is certified by a commissioner of oaths.
# The testator signs by making a mark in the presence of two witnesses and it is certified by the commissioner of oaths.&lt;ref&gt;s 2(1)(a)(i) read with s 2(1)(a)(v).&lt;/ref&gt; The testator may make a cross, a thumbprint or any other mark as a “signature.” This is actually very common due to the high rates of illiteracy in South Africa.

==== Signing and signature ====
In terms of section 2(1)(a)(i), a will is not valid unless it is signed by the testator or someone else (a proxy) on the testator's behalf. Where a will is signed by a proxy, the latter must do so in the testator's presence and by the testator's direction. For all persons involved in the execution process, a “signature” includes the making of an initial; in the case of the testator, it also includes the making of a mark, such as a cross or a thumbprint, but in that event the will must be certified as set out below.

The will must be signed by the testator or the proxy, or be acknowledged by the testator, and (if applicable) the proxy, in the presence of two or more competent witnesses present at the same time.

The witnesses must attest and sign the will in the presence of the testator and of each other, and, if the will is signed by a proxy, in the presence also of the latter. A witness, unlike a testator, may not sign by making a mark.

If there is more than one page to the will (other than the page on which it ends), the testator or proxy must sign or make a mark on each and every page of the will.&lt;ref&gt;s 2(1)(a)(v).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Liebenberg v The Master]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear from the Act&lt;ref&gt;s 2(1)(a)(iii).&lt;/ref&gt; whether witnesses are required to sign on every page or just at the end of the will, as it just says that they must sign the will. It is generally accepted that witnesses are not required to sign every page; they are simply required to sign any page anywhere on the page.

==== Certificate ====
When a testator signs his will with a mark, or by proxy, a certificate from a commissioner of oaths is required, in which the commissioner certifies that he or she is satisfied as to the identity of the testator, and that the document is the will of the testator. In terms of the Wills Act, the commissioner must sign anywhere on every page of the will. The certificate must be completed as soon as possible after the will is signed by the testator or the proxy. Should the testator die before the certificate is made or completed, the commissioner must as soon as possible thereafter complete the certificate and sign the will as indicated above. The importance of this requirement was seen in the case of ''[[Tshabalala v Tshabalala]]''.

The commissioner of oaths may not act in a dual capacity as witness, for witnesses are required to attest and sign the will in the presence of the commissioner. In these circumstances, therefore, four persons are required to sign in order to validly execute the will: the two witnesses, the testator placing a mark (or person signing on behalf of the testator) and the commissioner. However, there appears to be no reason why an instructing attorney who drafts a will cannot also commission it.

==== Witnesses ====
Two witnesses are required for the valid execution of a will. The witnesses must be at least fourteen years of age—recall that a testator must be at least sixteen to execute his own will—and must be competent to give evidence in a court of law. In terms of section 4A of the Wills Act, a witness to a will and the witness’ spouse cannot take any benefit under the will. The witnesses are required only to sign the last page.

=== Condonation ===
The courts are vested with the power to condone a will that does not comply strictly with the formalities discussed above. In this regard, section 2(3) of the Wills Act states that

&lt;blockquote&gt;if a court is satisfied that a document or the amendment of a document drafted or executed by a person who has died since the drafting or execution thereof, was intended to be his will or an amendment of his will, the court shall order the Master to accept that document, or that document as amended, for the purposes of the Administration of Estates Act, as a will, although it does not comply with all the formalities for the execution or amendment of wills referred to in subsection (1).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, a court may order that a document which has not been executed in strict compliance with the will-making formalities is nevertheless to be treated as if it were a valid will. The court has the power to make an order of validity to avoid frustrating the will of the testator.&lt;ref&gt;At the time the ''Kidwell'' case came before the court, s 2(3) was not yet in operation.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that there is a general discretion vested in the courts to condone non-compliance with formalities. To obtain such an order, it is essential to prove

* that the document was personally drafted by the testator, or personally executed by the testator;
* that the testator has died since the drafting or execution of the document in question; and
* that the testator intended the document to be his will or an amendment thereof.

If the court is of this opinion, it may order the Master to accept the document as the testator's will, even though it does not comply with “all” the required formalities, but the court must be absolutely sure. This power is utilised sparingly.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Ex Parte Maurice]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Macdonald v The Master]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Smith v Parsons]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Van Wetten v Bosch]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although, therefore, an electronic will, stored on a computer hard drive, for example, which has not been printed or executed, is invalid due to the fact that as it is not in writing nor validly executed, it can be saved by section 2(3). In Van der Merwe v Master of the High Court,&lt;ref&gt;[2010] JOL 26090 (SCA).&lt;/ref&gt; an appeal was brought to have an unsigned document accepted as the will of the deceased. The court noted that the lack of a signature had never, in terms of section 2(3), been held to be a complete bar to a document being declared a will. The court considered whether the document was drafted by the deceased, and whether the deceased intended it to be his will. The appellant provided proof that the document had been sent to him by the deceased, giving the document an authentic quality. It was not contested that the document still existed and had not been amended or deleted. From the title of the document, the court held it to be clear that the deceased intended the document to be his will. The court upheld the appeal, declaring the will to be valid.

Despite the existence of section 2(3), it remains vital for wills to be properly executed in accordance with the requirements of section 2(1), because the lengthy delays and financial expense involved in obtaining a court order that a defective document be treated as a will can be disastrous for the testator's family. In addition, it may not always be possible to satisfy the requirements for such an order, even when the testator's intentions can be clearly established.

=== Invalid wills ===
There are five ways in which a will can be rendered invalid:

# The will is not executed in compliance with formalities. (This includes incompetence of witnesses.)
# The witnesses or testator do not have the required capacity or animus testandi at the time of the execution of the will.
# The testator was unduly influenced, deceived or otherwise forced to make the will (i.e. the will was not made voluntarily).
# The will is made dependent on a condition which cannot be fulfilled.
# The will has been revoked.

Improper execution of any one page of a will generally invalidates not only that page but the entire will. However, if the rest of the will is properly executed and contains all the essential matter—that is, the whole of the dispositions of the testator's property—there is authority to suggest that the defective page may be expunged and the properly executed pages treated as the complete and valid will of the testator.

All questions as to the validity of a will must, notwithstanding that the will has been registered by the Master, be determined by the court. If a will is regular on the face of it—that is, if it is apparently in proper form and in compliance with the requirements of the law, and if there is no external sign or mark of any flaw in it—it is presumed to be valid; hence, if it is sought to establish the invalidity of the will, the onus of proving the cause or reason of the invalidity is upon the person endeavouring to set aside the will. This rule as to the onus of proof is applied whether the will is attacked on the ground of non-compliance with the formalities required by law, or of forgery, or of undue influence, or of incapacity of the testator, such as his insanity.

Where an action is brought to have a will declared invalid, the executor and all the beneficiaries under the will must be joined as defendants in the action. Where the facts are not in dispute, and where there is no danger of collusion, an order may be granted by way of application and on affidavit.

==== Revocation ====
When a testator executes a document in accordance with the formalities for a will, the document remains in existence as the testator's will until such time as the testator

* decides to revoke it; or
* manifests this revocatory intention in one of the recognised acts of revocation.

Even a document which does not comply with the execution formalities, but which was intended by the testator to be his will, must be revoked by the testator in one of the recognised ways to avoid the possibility that a court may make an order in terms of section 2(3) directing that the document be accepted as the testator's will.

If the testator intends to revoke his or her will but does not carry out one of the recognised acts of revocation, a court can make an order in terms of section 2A revoking the will for the testator if there is proof of the testator's revocatory intention, provided that the requirements of section 2A are satisfied.

The requirements for a court to intervene in terms of section 2A are different from those which apply in terms of section 2(3). The issue of whether or not section 2A can be applied in circumstances where the testator revokes a portion of his or her will and simultaneously introduces new testamentary provisions in place of the revoked provisions is problematic.

===== Right of revocation =====
A testator may revoke his will at any time, even if he or she has expressly agreed not to do so. There are two exceptions to this rule.

# The first exception occurs in the case of a joint will, in which the testators have “massed” their property. If, after the death of one of the testators, the survivor has accepted benefits under the joint will, he or she cannot revoke his or her portion of the joint will.
# The other exception arises in the case where certain forms of pacta successoria are embodied in antenuptial contracts. Some of these dispositions may never be revoked even if both husband and wife desire to do so.

===== Manner =====
At common law, the modes of revocation were not altogether clear. Generally, it was agreed that a testator could revoke his will

* by concluding a later will or codicil;
* by destroying the will; or,
* in so far as a legacy in a will is concerned, by ademption.

However, section 2A of the Wills Act allows the court to condone an act of revocation if the court is satisfied that the testator intended to revoke his will or part of it, even though the will was not revoked in one of the ways recognised by the common law. It would seem, however, that a will cannot be revoked by virtue of an oral statement made by the testator even if made before a number of witnesses.

====== Later will or codicil ======
A will can be revoked by a subsequent valid will or by a codicil. A codicil is a supplement to a will: a testamentary instrument intended to alter an already executed will. Later wills are obviously the later wills in a series of wills executed by the same person. A valid will loses all legal force and effect—that is, its validity—if it is revoked by the testator before his death. In revoking a previous will, the testator must intend to revoke the previous will; if accidentally done, the revocation is not effective.

A will can also be revoked by an antenuptial contract; likewise, provisions in an antenuptial contract may be revoked by a subsequent will, provided, of course, that the surviving spouse adiates thereunder.

A revocation may be express, by virtue of a clause known as a revocatory clause, or implied from the fact of provisions in the later will being inconsistent with those in the former. When certain dispositions in the two wills are inconsistent with each other, those in the earlier will are revoked. It follows that, if the two wills are entirely inconsistent, the earlier will is completely revoked. Where, however, it is possible to reconcile the provisions in both wills, such reconciliation should be made. A revocation is effected the moment the revoking will is duly executed.

====== Physical or symbolic destruction ======
The physical or symbolic destruction of a will constitutes revocation and renders it invalid.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Senekal v Meyer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marais v The Master]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A will may be completely revoked by the testator's destruction of it: for example, by burning it, or by cutting it into pieces, or by defacing it, or by cancelling it, or by erasing his signature—provided that the act is in each case done with the intention of revoking the will. Deletion of an entire will is an act of destruction that constitutes revocation, and is thus governed by the common law, but a deletion of a portion of a will, by and large, amounts to an amendment and consequently has to comply with certain prescribed formalities.

The destruction of a copy of a will does not normally constitute an effective revocation, but the destruction of a duplicate original revokes both it and the other duplicate original (filed usually with a third party). The partial revocation of a will by means of a deletion or alteration is regulated by the Wills Act.

If, on the death of a person, his original will, or a duplicate original will, cannot be found, but it is proved to have been in his possession, a presumption arises that it was destroyed by the testator with the intention of revoking it. This presumption may, of course, be rebutted: for example,

* by satisfactory evidence that the will has been mislaid or had been inadvertently destroyed; or
* where the testator destroys his or her will in the mistaken belief that it had been revoked by a later will, and this later will turns out to be invalid;

but not by the fact that a duplicate original of the will is found in the possession of a firm of attorneys.

====== Ademption ======
Ademption arises where the testator leaves a legacy in a will, and thereafter, in his lifetime, voluntarily alienates the subject matter of the legacy, as when Rodney bequeaths a farm to Shaun, and then sells or donates it. If this happens, the legacy is regarded as having been tacitly revoked, or “adeemed,” as it has lapsed by ademption.

If, however, the alienation is not voluntary—if, that is, the testator parts with the thing or its possession out of necessity—ademption does not take place. Such would be the case where Rodney is forced to sell the farm to settle a judgment debt.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Barrow v The Master]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Other means of revocation ======
Section 2A of the Wills Act contemplates the revocation of a will by means other than those recognised at common law. The section permits a court to declare a will revoked where the testator has, intending thereby to revoke the will or part thereof,

* made a written indication on his will, or before death caused such indication to be made;
* performed any other act with regard to his will, or before death caused such act to be performed which is apparent from the face of the will; or
* drafted another document, or before death caused such document to be drafted.

The relationship between section 2A and section 2(3) of the Wills Act is not altogether clear. It seems inescapable, however, that section 2A must be interpreted against the backdrop of s 2(3).

====== Divorce or annulment of marriage ======
Section 2B of the Wills Act states that, if there is an existing will between spouses whose marriage is later dissolved by divorce or annulment, and if either spouse dies within three months of the date of the divorce, no benefit under the will is accorded to the ex-spouse. In other words, if a testator dies within three months after his or her marriage was dissolved, and the will was executed before the dissolution, the estate will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the will, but as if the previous spouse had died before the dissolution of the marriage—unless it appears from the will that the testator had intended to benefit the spouse despite the dissolution of their marriage.

The rationale for this rule is to give spouses who divorce a three-month period to change their wills.

===== Exceptions to the general rule that a will can be revoked =====
In ante-nuptial contracts, duly registered in the Deeds Registry, it is possible to include provisions for the devolution of the spouses’ estates. Parties to such a contract may not unilaterally make a will that conflicts with the ante-nuptial contract. If there has been a massing (where a joint will is drawn up between two or more people who mass their estates into one common pool) and the survivor adiates (i.e. accepts the terms of the will), the survivor will receive an interest in the estate, e.g. a usufruct or fideicommissium. When the survivor dies, the property will then devolve. Note that the surviving spouse cannot unilaterally devolve his or her estate in terms of another will.

===== Revival of a revoked will =====
Although the matter is not free from doubt, the better view is that a will which has been revoked by the testator, but which is actually still in existence, may be revived by the testator by means of a subsequent reviving document, without the necessity of re-executing the original will. In light of the condonation provisions contained in section 2(3) of the Wills Act, it seems that it is no longer necessary for the will or the reviving document to be properly executed; a court may condone these documents if the requirements of the section are met.

Where, however, the will has been revoked by destruction, it cannot be revived. The revocation of a will which itself revoked an earlier will does not have the effect of reviving the earlier will; to achieve that end, re-execution is necessary.

==== Alteration or variation ====
It is possible to alter or vary a valid will at any time after the will is executed. It is preferable merely to execute an entirely new will, but such an amendment is possible.

===== Amendment by testator =====
A testator may amend a will at any time prior to death. Any limitation of the power to amend is generally unenforceable. In the case of a will executed on or after January 1, 1954, which the testator amended on or after October 1, 1992, the amendment (including a deletion, addition, alteration or interlineation), made after the will is executed, is valid only if

* the amendment is identified by the signature of the testator or of a proxy (who must sign in the testator's presence and by the testator's direction);
* the signature is made by the testator or by a proxy, or is acknowledged by the testator and, if made by a proxy, also by the proxy in the presence of two or more witnesses as set out above;
* the amendment is identified by the signatures of the witnesses in the presence of the testator and of each other, and, if the amendment has been identified by the signature of a proxy, also in the presence of the proxy; and,
* where the amendment is identified by mark, or by the signature of a proxy, a commissioner of oaths certifies on the will that he has satisfied himself as to the identity of the testator and that the amendment has been made by or at the request of the testator.

Section 2(1)(b) of the Wills Act states that all the requirements for the execution of a valid will are required also for the execution of a valid amendment. There is a rebuttable presumption in section 2(2) of the Wills Act that any amendment to a will took place after the execution of the will.

In all instances where an amendment is identified in the presence of a commissioner, the certificate must be made as soon as possible after the amendment has been identified. If the testator dies after the amendment is identified, but before the commissioner has made the certificate, the commissioner must as soon as possible thereafter make the certificate.

===== Rectification by court =====
It is important to note the distinction between rectification and alteration:

* Rectification occurs in circumstances where the court corrects any error in the will.
* Alteration occurs where the court alters any provision of the will.

The need for rectification arises when the will does not correctly represent the testator's intention, due to some mistake of the testator or of the person who drafted the will.

The court will rectify a will in the following circumstances:

* where there is a request to correct a clerical error or description (as when, for example, the plot number of the land bequeathed is incorrect);&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Henriques v Giles]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* where there is a request to delete words or provisions included in error;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ex Parte Lutchman]]'' 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and
* where there is a request to insert words or provisions excluded in error. This is the most difficult circumstance for the court to pronounce on, as it requires a thorough exploration of the testator's intention.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Botha v The Master]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Van Zyl v Esterhuyse]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the will does not express the true intention of the testator, and that there is reliable evidence to show what his intention was.

===== Alteration or variation by the court =====
Where the wording of the will clearly and unambiguously reflects the intention of the testator, however, the position is otherwise, for the court will not as a general rule vary the terms of a will which can be carried out and are not illegal or contrary to public policy, unless authorized by statute to do so. The general rule is that the courts are very reluctant to alter a will. Nevertheless, the court does have a discretion, albeit a very limited one, to order a variation in truly exceptional cases, such as where there has been an unforeseen change of circumstances since the death of the testator, rendering the fulfilment of his directions practically impossible or utterly unreasonable, or which “threatens to make a shipwreck of the testator’s intention.”&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chapman v Chapman]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On change in circumstances, and where the execution of the will is impossible or unreasonable, see ''[[Ex Parte Sidelsky]]''.

Incorrect assumptions by the testator in this context refer to those regarding his assets and liabilities.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ex Parte Naude]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where strict execution would result in the failure of the bequest or the frustration of the testator's intention, see ''[[Ex Parte McDonald]]''.

Where the will is to be altered or varied out of necessity, see ''[[Ex Parte Douallier]]''.

Where the will is to be altered or varied because the manner of execution is not possible or would result in serious loss, see ''[[Ex Parte Dittmarn]]''.

==== Incorporation by reference ====
Since all the pages of a will must be executed in compliance with the necessary formalities, a testator may not incorporate into a will, by reference, terms of a separate document, whether or not that document has been formally executed. The question of incorporation arises only when the document referred to contains matters that form an integral part of the will. To be complete and effective, a testamentary disposition must identify

* the property bequeathed;
* the extent of the interest bequeathed; and
* the beneficiary.

Where one of these essential matters is left to a separate, unattested document, the disposition fails.

Where, however, the document in question contains merely incidental matters, it is not an essential part of the disposition or the will; the question of incorporation does not arise at all. Such a document may nonetheless be referred to as part of the “surrounding circumstances” in order to construe or apply the terms of the will. The effect of section 2(3) of the Wills Act, dealing with condonation (discussed above), on the incorporation-by-reference rule is open to discussion.

=== Obsolete and provincial wills ===
Prior to 1954, wills were regulated by a number of provincial statutes in addition to the common law. The law prior to 1954 is still relevant to wills executed before that date.

A remnant of the common law, in the form of the soldier's will, survived until 1992, when it was rendered obsolete by the Law of Succession Amendment Act.

=== Joint or mutual wills ===
A will may be executed in one document by two persons, in which case it is termed a joint or mutual will. The two persons are usually spouses married in community of property, but they may be spouses married out of community, or may not be married to each other, as in the case of two sisters.

No additional formalities or witnesses are required for the execution of a mutual will. Where, however, the will confers reciprocal benefits on the testators, it is advisable that the will be not written by either of them: If the writer is the survivor, the rule applies that a person can take no benefit under a will written by himself. For the survivor to benefit under the will in such a case, either a court must condone the will, or there must be proof of confirmation of the disposition by the first-dying, either by his writing on the will or by other satisfactory evidence.

Notwithstanding its form, a joint will is simply two separate wills embodied for convenience in one document. Usually the dispositions by each testator relate to his or her own property, or where the testators are married in community of property, to his or her half share of the joint property: for example, where each of the testators appoints the other as heir, or as heir together with the children of the marriage.

Sometimes, again, a joint will is in fact the will of the first-dying only: for example, where the will appoints the survivor of the testators as sole heir of the first-dying, or as heir together with the children. In these cases, the portion of the will relating to the dispositions by the first-dying is not binding on the survivor, and the latter may revoke his or her portion of the will. But if, in addition, there is a disposition of the joint estate of the testators, or of a portion of it, giving the survivor a limited interest in the property, and disposing of such property after his or her death to other persons, the will is said to effect a “massing” of the estate, and is binding on the survivor if he or she accepts any benefits under the disposition.

=== Probate of wills ===
Every person who is in possession of a will of a deceased must send the will to the Master, who registers it in a register of estates. This registration is termed “granting probate of the will.”

==== Lost wills ====
Where a will has been lost or destroyed, but a copy or draft is in existence, the court, if satisfied that the testator did not intend to revoke the will, may authorise the Master to grant probate of it.

If no copy of the will is available, its contents may be proved by oral evidence, provided that such evidence is very clear and specific. Where, therefore, it was proved that a husband and wife had signed a joint will which was left with their attorney for safe keeping, and that, after the death of the husband, the will could not be found (the probabilities being that the will had been lost or destroyed in the attorney's office and not removed by either of the testators), the court held that the will was valid; it adopted a reconstructed will.

=== Content of wills ===
A South African testator has almost unlimited freedom of testation and may stipulate in his or her will whatever he or she wishes. As a result, the contents of wills may vary greatly.

The main provisions in wills are those which dispose of the property of the testator to a person or persons. Subsidiary provisions regulate the distribution of the estate by appointing executors to liquidate and to distribute the property in the estate, and where necessary by appointing administrators to manage the property, and guardians or tutors to minors and their property.

In the simplest possible form of will, the testator simply bequeaths all property to a named person. On the death of the testator, that person, if alive when the testator dies, becomes the heir, and has a vested claim to the ownership of all the testator's property, subject to payment of the debts. In this case, there is no difficulty as to the identity of the beneficiary, or the identity of the property disposed of, or the nature of the interest granted in such property.

Wills, however, are not always so simply worded; they may, and usually do, contain provisions of a more complex nature. There may, for example, be more than one beneficiary. Instead of being named, beneficiaries may be identified by some description, such as “my children” or “my surviving children.” Instead being described as an aggregate (“my estate”), particular items of property may be specified, such as a farm or a motor car. Finally, the interest disposed of in the property may be

* less than ownership, such as a usufruct;
* a resolutive ownership, such as a fiduciary interest; or
* a suspensive or contingent interest, such as a fideicommissary interest.

The effect of these testamentary devices is that the same thing may be given to more than one person, either concurrently or alternatively or successively. In order to appreciate the effect of these “comprehensive and elastic provisions of our law,”&lt;ref&gt;Estate Kemp v McDonald’s Trustee.&lt;/ref&gt; it is necessary to know the difference between inheritance and legacy, between ownership and usufruct, and between vested, future and conditional interests.

==== Inheritance and legacy ====
There is a particularly important distinction to be made between legacies and inheritances. This distinction plays an important role in the final distribution of an estate. The estate of a deceased person is distributed by the executor by first paying the debts, then handing over the legacies and prelegacies, and finally giving the balance to the heir or heirs.

A legacy is a disposition in a will, to a person termed the “legatee,” of things which are described either specifically or generally. A specific legacy is one of

* a specified thing, such as a farm, a motor car or a particular debt owed to the testator; or
* a specified collection of things, such as a library or a flock of sheep.

A general legacy is a disposition of a class of things described as a rule by number or quantity, such as a thousand sheep, or R1,000. It would seem to follow that a legacy of all the money to the credit of the testator in a particular bank is a specific legacy.

When a legacy fails because the legatee does not want to or cannot inherit his or her benefit (for example, he or she repudiated the legacy or he or she dies before the testator), there are three possibilities:

* a substitute may be provided for in the will or ''ex lege'';
* accrual may take place; or
* the bequest may fall into the residue of the estate and will be inherited by the residuary heirs.

Should a legacy fail, and the testator has not appointed a substitute, or accrual is not possible, the legacy will form part of the residue of the estate, or will form part of the intestate estate to be inherited by the intestate beneficiaries.

A prelegacy is a legacy which is left to an heir in priority to the other heirs, and in addition to any other share of the inheritance which the heir may be entitled to receive.

An inheritance is a disposition in a will, to a person termed the heir, of the residue of the estate, after the debts, legacies and prelegacies have been satisfied. It follows that the heir is in effect a residuary legatee. There may be more than one heir, in which case the shares left to them may be specified to be equal or unequal.

The institution of an heir or heirs is not today essential for the validity of a will. If the will, however, appoints only legatees, and if there is a balance left over after the debts and legacies have been paid or satisfied, there is an intestacy as to such balance. It follows that a person can die partly testate and partly intestate, although there is a presumption in favour of testacy.

An heir may be appointed as from a certain date or event, or until a certain date or event.

The chief difference between the laws relating to inheritance and to legacy arises from the fact that,

* in the case of a legacy, specified or particular property is left; whereas,
* in the case of an inheritance, the property is not specified, but consists of such property as happens to belong to the testator, or a fractional portion of such property.

It follows that, if the testator bequeaths specified property which does not in fact belong solely to him, problems arise which are not met with in inheritance.

==== Prior and legal rights ====
The [[Roman-Dutch law|Roman-Dutch]] notions of [[legitime|legitimate portion]]&lt;ref&gt;Abolished: Cape Colony, Succession Act 23 of 1874; Transvaal, Proclamation No. 28 of 1902. When a legitimate portion was not provided, the will could be set aside by the action ''in officioso testamento'', or if insufficient it could be remedied by the action ''in supplementum legitimae''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''lex hac edictali''&lt;ref&gt;A twice-married testator could not bequeath to his widow more than the least portion left to any child of the first marriage. Abolishsed: Cape Colony, Act 26 of 1873; Transvaal, Proclamation No. 28 of 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; in testamentary succession were abolished at the turn of the 20th century under the influence of [[English law]]. Similarly, South Africa did not adopt the family provision and dependants’ relief of English law under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependents) Act 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Willie M Van Der Westhuizen, “South Africa”, 15 ''International Legal Practitioner'' (1990), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vested, conditional and future interests ====
An interest or benefit under a will may, on the death of the testator, either vest in the beneficiary immediately, or be contingent upon the fulfilment of some condition. If vested, it may be enjoyable presently, or in the future only.

==== Vested interests ====
A vested interest refers to an inheritance right which has become unconditionally fixed and established in the beneficiary, with the result that it forms an asset in the beneficiary's estate; it may be disposed of by him or her ''inter vivos'' or ''mortis causa''; and it is normally transmissible to the beneficiary's heirs on his death (unless the right is purely personal to the beneficiary, such as a usufruct).

The terms ''dies cedit'' and ''dies venit'' are very important when dealing with vesting of rights.

* The phrase used to indicate that a right has vested is ''dies cedit'', which indicates that the day or time has come when the right is due or owing.
* Another phrase, ''dies venit'', denotes that the time for enjoyment of the thing has arrived; that is to say, that the possession and use of the thing may be claimed.

If the right has vested, but its enjoyment is postponed to the future, there is ''dies cedit'' but not ''dies venit''. The time for enjoyment can, of course, arrive only after or simultaneously with vesting. When it does arrive, there is both ''dies cedit'' and ''dies venit''. If there has been no vesting it follows that ''dies nec cedit nec venit''.

==== Conditional interests ====
The question of whether, on the death of the testator, an interest under a will is conditional or vested, or vested but not immediately enjoyable, depends entirely on the intention of the testator. This intention is gathered from the language of the will. A testator may postpone ''dies cedit'' or ''dies venit'', or both, by means of conditions or time clauses (terms), and may make a specific benefit dependent on a condition, or may link it to a term or period of time.

Suppose that the testator leaves an interest subject to a condition. A condition is a provision that, on the occurrence or non-occurrence of some uncertain future event, a right shall either be conferred or be discharged. There must be uncertainty as to the event, either because it may never happen, or because, although it must happen, it may not happen before some other specified event, such as the death of a particular person, takes place. For example, the testator may leave a sum of money to Helen “if she attains the age of 21,” or “if Helen becomes Mayor of Cape Town.”

The most common form of condition found in wills is “if A survives B” (B being some specified or determinable person). The effect of an interest being left conditionally is that it vests, ''dies cedit'', only when the condition has been fulfilled. Prior to the fulfilment of the condition, there has been no ''dies cedit'' (or ''dies venit''), and the beneficiary acquires merely a contingent right to the benefit. Suppose, then, that the testator leaves “R1,000 to my son if and when he attains the age of 21.” Upon the death of the testator, and if the son is alive but under twenty-one, he acquires no vested interest. Consequently, if he dies before reaching that age, nothing is transmissible to his heirs. If, however, he attains the age of 21 ''dies cedit'', and the legacy thereupon vests in him. The same principles are applicable where an interest is left “to Armand and upon his death after the testator to Lara.” Lara acquires a vested interest only if she survives both the testator and Armand.

The conditions mentioned above are suspensive. A resolutive condition also may be attached to an interest: for example, where a usufruct is left to a widow “provided our children continue to reside with her.” In such a case, the usufruct vests in the widow on the testator's death, but not absolutely for her lifetime; on the fulfilment of the resolutive condition, a divesting takes place.

There is a distinction, then, between suspensive and resolutive conditions, with regard to their influence on ''dies cedit'' and ''dies venit''. There is also a distinction between suspensive and resolutive time clauses with regard to their influence on ''dies cedit'' and ''dies venit''.

* '''Suspensive conditions''': The right does not vest in the beneficiary until the condition is fulfilled. For example, X bequeaths his farm to Y on condition that Y obtains an LLB degree.  If Y does not get an LLB degree, he will never obtain a right to the farm.
* '''Resolutive conditions''': The bequest terminates on the fulfilment of the condition. For example, A bequeaths his farm to B. If B remarries, the farm will devolve on C. Thus B has a vested right to the farm until fulfilment of the condition.

===== Future interests =====
The nature of an interest which is vested but not enjoyable, as opposed to one which is both vested and enjoyable, is well illustrated by the case of a legacy by the testator of “a sum of money to my daughter, payable on her attaining the age of 25 years.” In such a case, the legacy is generally not conditional upon the daughter's attaining the age of 25, but the enjoyment of it merely is postponed. It follows that, on the death of the testator if the daughter is alive, ''dies cedit'' occurs, and the legacy vests in her, but ''dies venit'' only occurs when she reaches the age of twenty-five. If the daughter dies before reaching twenty-five, her right to the legacy passes to her heirs.

An example of a similar disposition is where the testator leaves “my estate to my children, the division not to take place until the death of their mother.” No condition is imposed as to the children acquiring their shares, but their enjoyment merely is postponed. The death of the mother is an event which is certain to occur. It fixes the time for the division and enjoyment by the children of their shares. Upon the death of the testator, ''dies cedit'' as far as the interests of the children are concerned, but ''dies venit'' only when the death of the mother occurs. If one of the children dies before the mother, his share vests in such child's own estate.

A similar disposition is the following one in a mutual will: “The estate is bequeathed to our children, but the survivor of us is to have the possession, the children to have no right to their portions until the death of the survivor.”

===== Valid and invalid conditions =====
Under the common law, it is common to say that, if anyone attacks the validity of a will, he will lose all bequests in terms of the will. Thus conditions excluding the jurisdiction of the court were considered valid. The case of ''[[Barclays Bank v Anderson]]'' changed this.

Conditions which are impossible to carry out are invalid.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Garfinkle v Estate Garfinkle]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions regarding the insolvency of the beneficiary are valid. It is common to provide that, if the beneficiary becomes insolvent, the bequest lapses; accordingly, the bequest will not form part of the insolvent estate.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anderson v Estate Anderson]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Nudum praeceptum'' ====
If a testator places a prohibition on a bequest but fails to say what should happen with the bequest if the prohibition is contravened, it is said that the prohibition is nude (''nudum praeceptum''). In other words, the prohibition is of no effect, and the beneficiary will receive the bequest free from any prohibitions.

==== Estate massing ====
Estate massing takes place when two or more testators combine or mass the whole or parts of their estates into one consolidated unit and then dispose of it in terms of their mutual will:

In the case of common-law estate massing, a real right is transferred to the survivor. In the case of statutory estate massing,&lt;ref&gt;See s 37 of the Administration of Estates Act.&lt;/ref&gt; a limited right is transferred to the survivor.

Since estate massing places a burden on the survivor, the doctrine of election comes into play. The survivor has to adiate or repudiate the massing before there can be any legal consequences.

==== Customary law ====
The same principles are applicable to testators living under a system of customary law.

==== Testamentary devices ====
We have dealt thus far with the differences between conditional, vested and future interests, since these distinctions must be known before we can appreciate the effect of the various types of dispositions in wills which dispose of interests of a more complicated nature than a simple and unconditional institution of heirs or of legatees.

A testator frequently does not dispose of the full ownership of his assets to any one or more persons, particularly in the case of landed property; he grants interests in the property less than full ownership, such as

* usufruct;
* successive interests, known as fideicommissary substitutions; or
* interests in the alternative, known as direct substitutions.

These various interests will be treated first; thereafter combinations of the various interests.

===== Usufruct =====
A usufruct, which is often confused with the fideicommissum, essentially forms part of the [[law of property in South Africa|law of property]], although it is often used in wills. A testator bequeaths the property rights to one person (the ''dominus'' or remainderman), but the right to use, enjoy and take the fruits of the property to another (the usufructuary). In other words, instead of leaving the full ownership of the estate, or of a specified thing, to one person, the testator may leave the ownership to one person, subject to a usufruct in favour of another person. For example, the testator leaves “my farm to A subject to a life usufruct in favour of B.” On the testator's death, both of these interests vest, the usufruct in B, and the remaining rights of ownership in A.

There are consequently two concurrent vested interests belonging to different persons in the same thing, the one enjoyable presently and the other in the future only. B's interest, the right to use the farm and to take its fruits, endures until B's death, whereupon it is extinguished; consequently B's heirs or successors acquire no rights in the farm. On B's death, A (if alive) becomes absolute owner of the farm. If A dies before B, that fact makes no difference to B's rights, for B's usufruct continues until his own death. A's ownership, subject to B's usufruct, passes to A's heirs or successors, who are bound by the usufruct until B dies.

===== Substitution =====
The testator may substitute one beneficiary for another, giving an interest to Arthur which in certain circumstances is to go to Boucher instead. There are two kinds of substitutions:

* direct (or vulgar) substitutions; and
* fideicommissary substitutions.

These are distinguished by the fact that

* in the case of direct substitution, an interest is conferred in the alternative upon one of two persons; while
* in the case of fideicommissary substitution, an interest is conferred successively on two persons, one receiving it after the other.

Substitution, in other words, occurs when a testator appoints a beneficiary to inherit a benefit, but at the same time nominates another beneficiary to take the place of the appointed beneficiary (legatee or heir) upon the occurrence of an event, usually the death of the appointed beneficiary.

====== Direct substitution ======
Direct substitution can be created by the testator himself, or can operate by law (ex lege) in terms of section 2C of the Wills Act. In the case of direct substitution, an interest in property is left to one person (whether as heir or as legatee), subject to the condition that, if for some reason or other the interest does not vest in him, it is to go to another person. The reason usually specified is the death of the first-mentioned person, if it takes place prior to the death of the testator. It may also be some other reason, such as the first person's repudiation of the interest, or that person's being unable to succeed to the benefit.

Suppose, for example, that the testator leaves “my farm to Tim, but if Tim has predeceased me, it is to go to Cameron.” On the testator's death, if Tim is alive, the farm vests absolutely in Tim, and Cameron's interest is entirely extinguished. If, on the other hand, Tim dies before the testator, Tim's interest is extinguished. Consequently, Tim's heirs or successors acquire no rights; if, in that case, if Cameron is still alive when the testator dies, the farm vests absolutely in Cameron. It is important to note that the interest goes to one or other of the beneficiaries mentioned, not to both of them; it is, as noted above, a case of conferral in the alternative.

A direct substitution will not be implied unless it is clear, as a matter of “necessary implication,”{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} that the testator so intended in respect of an event actually contemplated by the testator. But a form of implied direct substitution has been created by statute: Whenever a predeceased descendant of the testator would have become entitled, if he had survived the testator, to any benefit under the will of the testator, the descendants of that descendant are entitled to take that benefit per stirpes, unless the terms of the will indicate a contrary intention.

====== Fideicommissary substitution ======
A substitution is fideicommissary when an interest is given to one person (whether as an heir or as a legatee), subject to the passing of the interest to another person on the fulfilment of a condition. The person to whom the interest is first given is termed the “fiduciary;” the person who is substituted for him on the fulfilment of the condition, the “fideicommissary;” and the whole disposition, a “fideicommissum.” A fideicommissum may be defined, then, as the grant of an interest in property to one person, subject to the interest's passing to another person on the happening of a condition.

A simple form of fideicommissum is constituted where the testator leaves “my farm (or estate) to Stuart, and on Stuart’s death, after me, it is to go to Luke.” The legal effect of this disposition is that, on the testator's death, if Stuart is then alive, the dominium of the farm vests in Stuart, subject to Luke's interest, which is as follows: Luke acquires no vested interest in the farm, only a contingent right, for Luke's interest vests only if and when the condition is fulfilled—in this case, if Luke is alive when Stuart dies, in which event the fideicommissum terminates and the absolute ownership vests in Luke.

If Luke dies before Stuart, the condition of the fideicommissum fails, Luke's rights are extinguished, and there is nothing to transmit to Luke's estate or successors (unless there is a clear indication in the will to the contrary). Stuart's fiduciary interest is then increased into full dominium.

If Stuart dies before the testator, then, under the old law, the fideicommissum failed, and Luke obtained no rights whatever on the death of the testator. This rule, however, has been abrogated, with the result that now, on the testator's death, Luke (assuming that he is alive) acquires the full dominium, for he succeeds directly to the testator, the fiduciary interest having fallen away.

It will be seen that a fideicommissum confers successive interests in the same property on two persons. The first interest vests (as a rule) on the death of the testator; the second (being conditional) vests only if and when the condition is fulfilled.

Fideicommissary substitution can be created expressly or impliedly. With regard to an implied fideicommissum, the so-called ''si sine liberis'' (meaning "if you die without children") clause is important; so, too, the legal position of the parties to a fideicommissum.

The nature of a fideicommissum is burdensome, since it limits the ownership of the fiduciary. It is not favoured in South African common law. A presumption against ''fideicommissa'' exists, but only where there is doubt as to whether a testator intended direct or fideicommissary substitution.

===== Difference between usufruct and fideicommissum =====
These two interests are similar in some respects, but they differ in others. They are very much alike, in that both a usufructuary and a fiduciary have the use and the enjoyment of the property for their lifetime; they differ in that, whereas a usufructuary can never automatically acquire any greater right in the property, a fiduciary's right may in his or her lifetime ripen into absolute ownership (if, for example, the fideicommissary dies before him).

The rights of the other person concerned in each case in these dispositions, the residuary owner and the fideicommissary respectively, naturally differ very considerably. In the case of a usufruct, the owner of the property has a vested right, although the owner's enjoyment is postponed, whereas the right of a fideicommissary is not vested, but rather contingent upon fulfilment of the fideicommissary condition.

It is frequently difficult to ascertain from a will which of these interests a testator intended to grant. The law reports contain numerous instances of the courts’ being requested to interpret wills where one party contends that the interest is usufructuary and the other claims that it is fiduciary. The actual decisions in these cases depend on whether the testator intended to grant the “remainder man,” the person who is to have the later enjoyment of the property, a vested or a conditional right.

In addition to the ordinary form of fideicommissum described above, two peculiar forms are recognized by the law, a fideicommissum residui and a fideicommissum purum.

===== Fideicommissum residui =====
The ''fideicommissum residui'' is a form of fideicommissum which constitutes an exception to the general rule that the fiduciary may not alienate the fideicommissary property. It is a fideicommissum of the residue or balance of the property left at the death of the fiduciary. Property is bequeathed to a fiduciary on condition that, on his or her death, whatever is left of the property is to go to another person.

The legal effect of such a disposition is that, by virtue of a rule of the Roman law, still in force in South Africa, the fiduciary is prima facie entitled in his or her lifetime to alienate or dispose of three-quarters of the property, but not more. Consequently, the fiduciary is only bound to transmit one-fourth of the property to the fideicommissary. If, however, the fiduciary gives security for restitution of one-quarter of the estate, the fiduciary may alienate the whole of the estate.

The fiduciary may not dispose of any of the property either by means of a donatio mortis causa, or by will. It follows that the fideicommissary may claim all of the property originally granted to the fiduciary that remains in the estate of the fiduciary upon the latter's death, even if it is more than a quarter of the original property. It would seem that, if the property remaining over has actually increased in amount or value, the fideicommissary may claim all of it on the principle that the person who bears the loss is entitled to the profits.

===== Fideicommissum purum =====
This was the original form of fideicommissum in Roman law, introduced to evade the technicalities and restrictions of the ordinary law of inheritance and legacy. It was a bequest to an heir or legatee (the fiduciary) with an instruction to hand over the bequest to a third party (the fideicommissary) who was otherwise disqualified from taking.

The interests of both the fiduciary and the fideicommissary vested immediately on the death of the testator, and were therefore simultaneous and coextensive rather than successive. The interest of the fiduciary was not a beneficial one; it was purely transitory, as the fiduciary was under an immediate and continuous duty to hand the bequest to the fideicommissary.

Later, other forms of unconditional fideicommissa came to be recognised, such as the fideicommissum in diem and the fideicommissum sub modo. With the gradual assimilation of the rules relating to fideicommissa and legacies, the fideicommissum purum lost its original purpose. Its application in Roman-Dutch law was apparently extremely rare.

In Estate Kemp v McDonald's Trustee, however, Innes CJ used the concept of fideicommissum purum in an attempt to explain the juristic nature of a testamentary trust in South African law. Although criticised, this decision was subsequently followed in numerous cases. The term “fideicommissum purum” was used to denote generally an unconditional fideicommissum: one without any condition suspending the vesting of the interest of the fideicommissary.

In Braun v Blann &amp; Botha NNO, however, the Appellate Division ruled that “it is both historically and jurisprudentially wrong to identify the trust with the fideicommissum and to equate a trustee to a fiduciary.” Nevertheless, it remains open to the testator to create an unconditional fideicommissum, such as one sub certo die: for example, a bequest to A for ten years, and thereafter to B.

===== Trust =====
A trust may be created by will or by an act inter vivos. A testamentary trust is constituted when a testator bequeaths property to one person, called a “trustee” or an “administrator,” with an instruction to administer it for the benefit of another person or other persons appointed by the will, or for an impersonal object or purpose (the so-called charitable trust).

The essential feature of a trust is the separation of the ownership or control of property from the beneficial enjoyment thereof. The trustee acquires no beneficial interest in the property, acting merely as a conduit pipe in carrying out the dispositions in favour of the beneficiary. The interest of the beneficiary in the property may vest immediately on the death of the testator, or at some later date, depending on the intention of the testator as expressed in the terms of the will. Statutory provision has been made for the protection of trust property which is settled upon a person either inter vivos or by will, to be administered by him or her for the benefit of other persons.

==== Bequests subject to a modus ====
A clause or provision in a will which imposes on a beneficiary the duty of employing the proceeds of a bequest for certain specified purposes is termed a modus. The addition of a modus to a bequest does not make it conditional. Consequently, the legacy vests in the legatee on the testator's death; no fideicommissum is created in favour of the persons intended to be benefited.

The modus has to be distinguished from a condition. The modus can manifest itself in different forms:

* in the interest of the beneficiary himself;
* in the interest of a specific person; or
* in the interest of an impersonal purpose.

==== Interpretation of some common dispositions in wills ====
Frequently the language used in a will is not sufficiently clear and unambiguous for the executor to determine what interests in property are disposed of, or who the beneficiaries are. In such a case, it is necessary for the court to interpret the will. As stated before, the cardinal principle in construing a will is to ascertain from a consideration of it in its entirety the intention of the testator. In order to ascertain this intention, where the will is ambiguous, recourse is had to certain presumptions and canons of construction which have long been accepted in the interpretation of wills. Illustrations are given below of some of the more common and important dispositions, in connection with fideicommissa, which have been the subject of interpretation by the courts.

===== Presumption against fideicommissa =====
The court, in interpreting wills, leans in favour of an absolute ownership of property having been bequeathed rather than, as occurs in the case of a fideicommissum, a burdened ownership.

For instance, whenever a will mentions two persons as beneficiaries of the same property and there is a reasonable doubt whether the testator intended

* that both of them were to have interests, the one of them to have the property for life and the other to succeed the first-mentioned beneficiary on his death (in other words, a fideicommissum); or
* that one or other of them alone should have an interest, the second being substituted for the first only if the first does not as a fact succeed (in other words, a direct substitution),

there is a presumption that the disposition is not a fideicommissum, but that it is a direct substitution.

For example, suppose that the testator leaves “my farm to my son A and on A’s death to my son B.” It is not clear from these words whether the testator intended that both A, and B after A, should have an interest in the farm, or whether only one of them should acquire the farm. Since there is reasonable doubt as to the intention of the testator, the court will interpret the will as conferring an absolute ownership in the farm upon one of the sons only, thereby effecting a direct substitution. This the court does by assuming that the reference in the will to A's death meant not A's death at any time, but only if it occurred before the death of the testator. It follows that the will is construed as if it were worded “I leave my farm to my son A, and if A dies before me it is to go to my son B.”

This presumption arises only if there is a reasonable doubt as to the intention of the testator. Therefore, if it is shown that the testator contemplated the death of the first-mentioned beneficiary as taking place not in the testator's lifetime, but only after the testator's death, the presumption does not arise; the disposition is held to be a fideicommissum. For example, where the testator was fifty-seven years of age and left a farm to his grandson aged six, subject to the condition that, if the grandson came to die without lawful descendants, the farm should revert to the testator's children, the court held that the intention of the testator was to create a fideicommissum.

The presumption in favour of a direct substitution does not arise if it is clear that the testator intended to grant different interests in the same property to two persons, not alternatively but either successively (as in the case of a fideicommissum) or concurrently (as in the case where the ownership is left to one person subject to a usufruct in favour of another); in other words, there is no presumption that the interest of the beneficiary first mentioned is an ownership subject to a direct substitution, nor is there a presumption that his interest is usufructuary and not fiduciary.

===== Si sine liberis decesserit clause =====
One of the most common conditions inserted in wills regarding property passing from one person to another is “if the former dies without leaving children,” si sine liberis decesserit. For example, the testator leaves “my property to A, and if A dies without children, to B.” If A succeeds to the property and dies without leaving children, the condition is fulfilled and the property vests in B; but, if A dies, leaving children, the condition is not fulfilled. The property does not go to B; instead it goes to A's children, provided they are descendants of the testator and there are no contrary indications in the will, for in these circumstances a tacit fideicommissum in favour of the children is implied by law.

The same result is obtained where the si sine liberis condition is not express but implied. If the fiduciary is a descendant of the testator, and the fideicommissary is not, then in the absence of a contrary indication in the will the further condition ‘if the fiduciary die without children’ is implied before the fideicommissary interest can vest. Such a condition is implied in the case of fideicommissary substitution only and not in that of direct substitution.

==== Implied fideicommissa ====
In spite of the fact that there is a presumption against fideicommissa, nevertheless a fideicommissum is implied by law in favour of particular persons in the case of certain dispositions. The chief instances are those where an express fideicommissum is made conditional on a si sine liberis decesserit clause, and where there is a prohibition against alienation out of a family.

===== Fideicommissum subject to a si sine liberis condition =====
As we have just seen, where a testator leaves property to a fiduciary (A) subject to the condition (express or implied) that, if A should come to die without issue (si sine liberis decesserit), the property is to pass over to another person (B, the fideicommissary), the law implies a tacit fideicommissum in favour of A's issue, the liberi, provided that

* the liberi are descendants of the testator; and
* there are not sufficient indications in the will of a contrary intention on the part of the testator.

It follows that, if these conditions are met, and if A dies leaving children or remoter descendants, they will inherit the property in preference to B.

===== Prohibitions against alienation =====
If property is left to an heir on the condition that the heir shall not alienate it, but no provision is made for the property passing to any other heir in case of a breach of the condition, or if no heir is specified or indicated in whose favour the prohibition is imposed, the prohibition is of no force or effect and is said to be nudum, for there is no fideicommissary.

If, however, there is a provision that, on a breach of the condition, the property is to go to a certain heir, there is clearly a fideicommissum in favour of the mentioned heir, as where the testator leaves “my farm to A, subject to the condition that he shall not alienate it, and if he does the farm shall go to B.” Similarly, if a prohibition against alienation is made in favour of a class of persons, a fideicommissum is implied in favour of such class. For example, where the testator leaves “my farm to my daughter A, provided that she shall not alienate the farm out of the family,” a fideicommissum is created in favour of the testator's descendants. The class to be favoured must be clearly specified; otherwise no fideicommissum is constituted.

The question of whether one or more persons or generations are bound as fiduciaries by a prohibition against alienation depends on whether the prohibition is unicum (personal) or duplex (real).

If the prohibition is personal, it applies only to the persons prohibited and is confined to them. They may not alienate the property, but the fideicommissaries, once they have succeeded to the property, may do so. A prohibition is personal when it is imposed upon a certain person or persons by name or as a class, such as “children” (but not “descendants”), as, for example, where the testator leaves his farm to “my sons A and B,” or “to my sons,” or “to my children,” and prohibits them from alienating it out of the family. The restraint is personal to the children only or to the sons only, as the case may be. On their deaths, when the farm has descended to their heirs, the restraint is removed and the fideicommissum extinguished.

If, on the other hand, a prohibition is real, it binds all the persons to whom the property may descend. Not only is the first beneficiary or beneficiaries prohibited from alienating the property, but also any subsequent beneficiary to whom it may descend as a result of the fideicommissum. A prohibition is real when it is clearly the testator's intention to make it binding on successive or recurring generations, as when the testator prohibits his “descendants” from alienating the farm out of the family.

It is, however, enacted by the Immovable Property (Removal or Modification of Restrictions) Act that, after the commencement of the Act (October 1, 1965), any fideicommissum created in favour of more than two successive fideicommissaries shall be limited to two, whatever the wording of the will. Where the fideicommissum was created before the commencement of the Act, only two successive fideicomrnissaries are permitted from the date of the will. If, at the date of commencement, two or more fideicommissary substitutions have already taken place, the fideicommissum shall be terminated at the date of commencement.

==== Statutory aids to interpretation ====
The Wills Act contains several provisions that serve as interpretative aids when construing wills. Unless the context of a will indicates otherwise, when interpreting a will,

* an adopted child must be regarded as being born of its adoptive parents, not of its natural parents;
* the fact that a person was born out of wedlock is not taken into account when determining his or her relationship with the testator or another person;
* if a benefit is left to the children of a person or to members of a class of persons mentioned in a will, it is presumed that the benefit was intended to vest in the children of the person or in members of the class of persons who are alive at the time of the devolution of the benefit or who have already been conceived at that time and who are later born alive.

==== Combinations of various interests ====
Various interests (usufructuary, fiduciary, or fideicommissary) relating to the same property may be combined. Each of these interests may be made subject to direct substitutions. The following are examples of the less complex of these combinations.

===== Fideicommissum upon fideicommissum =====
A fideicommissum may be imposed upon a fideicommissum, as where the testator leaves “my farm to A; on A’s death after me it is to go to B; on B’s death after A it is to go to C.” In this case, B's interest is fideicommissary in respect of A's interest, and fiduciary in respect of C's interest. A familiar instance of such a disposition occurs in the case of a prohibition against the alienation of property out of a family, for there a fideicommissum is imposed on each successive generation; subject now, of course, to the statutory limit on the duration of fideicommissa.

===== Compendiosa substitutio =====
This is both a fideicommissary and a direct substitution in respect of the same persons. For example, the testator leaves “my farm to A, and on his death it is to go to B; if A dies before me it is to go to B.” The object of this double substitution which was in use in former times was to ensure that B would succeed if the fideicommissum collapsed owing to the fiduciary predeceasing the testator. Today the double substitution is superfluous.

===== Ownership subject to a usufruct with a direct substitution as to the usufruct at the testator’s death =====
For example, the testator leaves “my farm to my son A, subject to a life usufruct to my sister B, or if B has predeceased me, to my sister C.” The legal effect of this disposition is that, on the testator's death, the ownership of the farm vests in A, if he is then alive—subject to a life usufruct in favour of B, for whom C may be directly substituted. In other words, if B is then alive, she acquires the usufruct of the farm, and C acquires no rights. If B dies before the testator, but C is alive upon his death, C acquires the life usufruct.

===== Ownership subject to a usufruct as to which there is a fideicommissary substitution =====
For example, the testator leaves “my farm to my son, subject to a life usufruct to my mother, and on her death a life usufruct to my wife.” On the testator's death, the ownership of the farm vests in the son, if he is then alive, and the usufruct vests in the mother, if she is then alive. The wife, however, acquires no vested interest, for her right is conditional on her surviving the mother. The wife's usufruct vests only if and when she is alive at the time of the mother's death. If the mother predeceases the testator, but the wife is alive at his death, then of course the usufruct vests in the latter.

===== Ownership subject to a usufruct with a direct substitution as to the ownership at the testator’s death =====
For example, the testator leaves “my farm to my wife for her life, the farm to go on my death to my son A, or if A has predeceased me, to my son B.” On the testator's death the usufruct of the farm vests in his wife if she survives him, and the ownership of the farm subject to the usufruct vests in A, or, if A has predeceased the testator, in B.

===== Ownership subject to a usufruct with a direct substitution as to the ownership at the death of the usufructuary =====
For example, the testator leaves “my estate to my wife for her life, and on her death it is to be divided equally among our children or such of them as may then be alive.” On the testator's death, the usufruct of the estate vests in the widow, and on her death the ownership of the estate vests in the surviving children, these being directly substituted for the original group which consisted of the surviving children and those who predeceased their mother.

===== Fideicommissum in which one fideicommissary is directly substituted for another =====
For example, the testator leaves “my farm to X and if X dies after me without children, it shall go to Y, but if X dies leaving children it shall go to X’s children.” A fideicommissum of the farm is constituted, X being the fiduciary and the fideicommissary either X's children or Y, the latter being directly substituted for the children in the event of X dying without leaving children. A similar disposition is effected where the testator leaves his farm “to my son A and on A’s death after me to A’s eldest son; if A has no son then alive, to A’s eldest daughter.” A simple form of disposition, with the same effect, is where the testator institutes “my wife sole heir and after her decease our children, and in case of the predecease of any child his lawful descendants.”

=== Effect of wills ===
The chief effect of a will is to confer rights on the beneficiaries. A beneficiary, however, whether heir or legatee, acquires no right in the property of the testator unless he or she accepts the benefit.

==== Rights of heirs ====
On acceptance or adiation of the inheritance, the heir obtains a vested right to claim from the executor payment or delivery of all the property in the estate after satisfaction of the debts and legacies. But the heir's claim is enforceable only when the liquidation and distribution account has been confirmed. Where there is more than one heir, each has this right in respect of his proportionate share.

==== Rights of legatees ====
On the acceptance of a legacy, a legatee obtains a vested right to claim from the executor delivery of the specific asset bequeathed to him or her, or registration in the case of immovable property; this claim is enforceable only when the liquidation and distribution account has been confirmed.

Where the assets in the estate are sufficient to satisfy all the legacies, pecuniary and corporeal, in full, there is no difficulty as to each legatee obtaining delivery of the bequest; but problems arise where the property specified as being bequeathed did not in fact belong to the testator at all, or only belonged to the testator jointly with other persons.

Where the testator leaves as a legacy specified property which belongs in fact to a third person, but which the testator in error thought he or she owned, the legacy is void; if, however, the testator knew that the property belonged to a third person it is the duty of the executor to buy the property from the owner at a reasonable price and to hand it over to the legatee, and if unable to do so to pay the legatee its value. If the property had been mortgaged or pledged, and the testator was aware of that fact, then unless a contrary intention appears from the will it is the duty of the executor to discharge the debt and to hand over the property free to the legatee.

If the property specified belongs to the residuary heir then, whether the testator knew or did not know that fact, the legacy is valid. The heir, however, has an election to accept or to refuse the terms. If the heir accepts the inheritance, the heir must allow his or her own property to go to the legatee; if the heir refuses to adiate and retains his or her own property, the heir cannot accept any benefit under the will.

Where the property specified belongs jointly to the testator and to a third person it is clear that the testator cannot override the rights of the co-owner; the testator's will cannot do more than he or she personally could do and the legacy is not binding on the co-owner. There is a presumption in such a case that only the testator's share is bequeathed if it is doubtful from the will whether the testator intended to burden his or her estate with the duty of buying out the co-owner's share. This presumption may, however, be rebutted and more easily so where the testator bequeaths property belonging jointly to the testator and his or her spouse. If the property bequeathed belongs jointly to the testator and to the residuary heir, the whole of the property is deemed to be bequeathed; but the heir has an election whether to accept the terms of the will or to keep his or her share of the property.

If the property belongs to the legatee himself the legacy is void, unless the testator had some real right, such as a mortgage, in the property; in that case the testator is deemed to remit such right and to leave the property unburdened to the legatee.

===== Abatement of legacies =====
If, after the debts of the testator have been paid, the estate is insufficient to satisfy all the legacies in full, they are reduced proportionately or “abated.” There is a presumption that abatement applies to all the legacies unless the will shows a clear intention to the contrary. A will may, of course, make express provision for abatement, for example the abatement of annuities in the event of a shortfall of income. It would appear that South Africa law draws no distinction between specific and general legacies for the purposes of abatement.

The order of distribution among the beneficiaries in an estate which is unable fully to discharge all the legacies is analogous if not identical with the order of distribution in insolvency. The beneficiaries have personal claims against the estate and they are in the position of creditors who cannot all be paid in full. The preferred legatees correspond to the secured creditors, and the other legatees to the concurrent creditors. The preferred legatees have preference and are satisfied in full and the balance is divided proportionately among the remaining legatees. The heirs in such a case get nothing at all.

==== Rights of fiduciaries and fideicommissaries ====
Under a simple form of fideicommissum the right of the fiduciary (as stated earlier) vests on the death of the testator; the right of the fideicommissary vests only upon the fulfilment of the attached condition, which is almost invariably that the fideicommissary be alive at the death of the fiduciary, whereupon the fideicommissary becomes the unconditional owner of the property. Likewise, if the fiduciary for any reason fails to take or renounces his or her rights, the inheritance passes to the surviving fideicommissaries, provided that the latter class is then ascertainable and that there is no other provision in the will postponing vesting or enjoyment of the interest. Pending the vesting in the fideicommissary, the right and duties of the parties are as follows:

The fiduciary acquires a resolutive ownership; he or she has the right to possess the property, to use it and take the fruits, but not to depreciate it. The fiduciary may not alienate or mortgage the property except in the following cases:

*  Where the will confers the right of alienation on the fiduciary either expressly or impliedly, as in the case of a fideicommissum residui, when the fiduciary may alienate three-quarters of the property.
* Where all the persons, being majors, who are interested in the fideicommissum agree to the alienation, provided that the fideicommissum was imposed for their benefit and for no other reason. It follows that the fideicommissum may generally be extinguished by the joint act of the fiduciary and the fideicommissary. It must be noted that what is termed a “family arrangement” between the beneficiaries which purports to effect substantial deviations from the provisions of a will are as a rule not lawful; but special considerations arise in connection with fideicommissa permitting such departures.
* With the authority of the court on the grounds of necessity (ob causam necessarium),
** to pay the debts of the testator and to make provision for the legacies bequeathed by him or her when there is no other property available for the purpose;
** to pay taxes imposed on the property;
** to pay expenses which are necessary for the preservation or protection of the property; or
** to provide necessary maintenance for the children of the fiduciary where the latter is indigent.
* The court has power, by virtue of statute, to remove or modify testamentary restrictions on immovable property in certain circumstances, inter alia where it will be to the advantage of the persons, born or unborn, certain or uncertain, who are beneficiaries under a will.

The fiduciary's rights are subject to the rights of creditors. Hence execution may be levied against the fiduciary's rights in pursuance of a judgment obtained against him or her. On the insolvency, the fiduciary's rights vest in his or her trustee (unless the will provides otherwise) and they may be sold subject, of course, to the rights of the fideicommissary. A fiduciary, again, may let the property for the period of his or her right, but not beyond the same. Consequently, the fiduciary may not grant a lease which is entitled to registration, such as a lease in longum tempus, with the exception of a lease for his or her own life.

The fiduciary, if called upon, must give security for delivery of the property to the fideicommissary when the condition is fulfilled unless

* under the will the fiduciary is entitled to alienate the fideicommissary estate;
* the testator has dispensed with the requirement of security; and
* the fideicommissary is the child, brother, or sister of the fiduciary.

In the case of a fideicommissum residui, security for a quarter only of the property need be given. In the case of immovable property, it is the duty of the executor to have the terms of the fideicommissary disposition registered or endorsed against the title deeds of the property, and consequently there is probably no necessity for security to be given.

If the estate of the fideicommissary heir or legatee is sequestrated, his or her contingent interest does not vest in the trustee; but if the interest becomes vested while the estate is under sequestration, it ipso facto passes to the trustee.

A fideicommissary has prior to the vesting of his or her interest only a contingent right to the property (sometimes referred to as a mere spes or expectation of benefit). If, however, any attempt is made by the fiduciary or by any third persons to infringe the rights of the fideicommissary the court will give the latter ample and effective protection. Thus the court will interdict a threatened alienation of the fideicommissary property, and it will refuse to grant execution against the property in respect of a judgment obtained against the fiduciary. Similarly the court will generally not allow the fiduciary to mortgage the property, for the fideicommissary is not liable for the debts of the fiduciary; but as pointed out earlier, there are circumstances in which the court may consent to the mortgage or sale of the fideicommissary property. The contingent right of the fideicommissary may be ceded and such cession need not be notarially executed.

==== ''Jus accrescendi'' ====
''Jus accrescendi'', or the right of accrual, is the right of beneficiaries to whom an interest in property has been left jointly to take the share of one of them who fails to take his or her share. Such failure may take place by the death of the beneficiary before vesting occurs; or by the beneficiary's incapacity to take his or her share; or by the beneficiary's refusal to adiate.

Where the ''jus accrescendi'' operates the co-beneficiaries to whom the vacant portion accrues take the same shares thereof as they do of their own portion. Where it does not operate the share vacated by a co-heir devolves upon the intestate heirs of the testator, while the share vacated by a co-legatee falls into the residue of the estate and devolves upon the heirs, testate or intestate, of the testator.

The right of accrual, then, is the right co-heirs and co-legatees have of inheriting a share which a co-heir or co-legatee cannot, or does not wish to, receive. Accrual can, however, only operate if provision is not made for substitution either by the testator himself or herself, or ''ex lege'' through the operation of section 2C of the Wills Act.

Whether or not accrual operates in certain circumstances depends on the intention of the testator as it appears from the will. The testator may make some express provision on the point. If the intention of the testator is not clear, his probable intention must be deduced from certain indications in the language of the will itself, or from the surrounding circumstances. To assist the court in ascertaining the testator's probable intention various canons of construction or ''conjecturae'' have been evolved, the most important of which concerns the method of joinder of the beneficiaries. The mode in which beneficiaries are joined is only one of the indications, although an important one, in ascertaining the probable intention of the testator. It must be stressed, however, that these ''conjecturae'' are merely guides and not hard and fast rules of law.

===== Express provision concerning accrual =====
The testator may make express provision for a right of accruallapsing of the share of one of several beneficiaries by substituting the remainder in his place; for example, where he leaves his estate “to my children and if any of them predecease me, his share shall pass to the others,” or “shall revert to the estate,” or “to my children, or such of them as may be alive at my death.”

On the other hand, the testator may expressly negative any accrual to the original beneficiaries where he or she directs that upon the lapsing of a share it shall go to some third person or persons, e.g. where he appoints “my children as my heirs and if any of them predecease me his lawful descendants shall take his share.”

===== No provision concerning accrual =====
In the absence of any contrary indication in the will as to the testator's intention the ''jus accrescendi'' takes place where the beneficiaries have been appointed jointly, or ''re et verbis''; but not where they have been appointed to separate shares, or ''verbis tantum''. It is important to note, however, that even if the form of joinder of heirs in a will is ''verbis tantum'' the intention of the testator may be otherwise. It is in the will that indications of the testator's opinion must be sought but it is permissible and sometimes essential to read and interpret the will in the light of the relevant circumstances existing at the time of its making.

Thus there is generally a right of accrual where the appointment is joint, e.g. “to A and B jointly,” or simply “to A and B,” or “to our three sons.” On the other hand, there is ''prima facie'' no right of accrual where the appointment is ''verbis tantum'', i.e. to separate shares—e.g. where the property is left “to A and B in equal shares,” or where the estate “is to be divided into five portions each of which is to go to a specified person,” or where “the property is to be divided among the children, share and share alike”—and clearly not where separate and distinct portions of a farm are left to various beneficiaries.

In order that the ''jus accrescendi'' should operate where the beneficiaries are appointed ''verbis tantum'', it must appear from the will that the testator positively contemplated the lapse of a specific share, and that the testator intended that such share should in that event accrue to the other beneficiaries. It has been suggested that such an intention appears where the testator appoints two or more persons “sole and universal heirs.”

The rules relating to the ''jus accrescendi'' apply not only where the interest disposed of is ownership but also where it is a fideicommissary interest, or a usufruct, or a right to income under a trust; but not where it is a fiduciary interest, and adiation has taken place, for the interest has then vested.

Once an interest has vested in the beneficiaries there can be no ''jus accrescendi'', because if one of the beneficiaries dies his share vests in his estate. There is an obvious exception in the case of a usufruct; on the death of one of the usufructuaries, his interest accrues to the other usufructuaries.

== Administration of deceased estates ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}

=== Security ===
Any person who has not been nominated as executor in a will, or who has not been exempted from providing security in terms of a will, must furnish security to the Master for the proper performance of their duties. Security is in the form of a bond of security, which is usually obtained from an insurance company against payment of a premium. If the executor later defaults and causes loss to the estate, the Master can enforce the security and recover the loss from the executor or the surety.

The amount of security is determined by the value of the assets in the estate. The cost of furnishing security is a liability against the estate, and is paid as an administration cost. The executor will not be required to furnish security

* where that person is the parent, spouse or child of the deceased; or
* where that person has been exempted from providing security in the deceased's will.

Despite the above, the Master will call for security

* where the executor's estate has been sequestrated;
* where the executor has committed an act of insolvency;
* where the executor resides outside South Africa; or
* for any other good reason which, in the opinion of the Master, necessitates security.

=== Advertising for creditors ===
In terms of section 29 of the Administration of Estates Act, as soon as letters of executorship have been granted, the executor must immediately advertise for creditors to submit claims against the estate within thirty days for publication.

The advertisements are required to be published on the same day in the Government Gazette, and in a newspaper that circulates in the district where the deceased was ordinarily resident at the time of death. If, at any time within twelve months prior to death, the deceased resided in any other district, the advertisement must also appear in a newspaper circulating in that district.

If a creditor does not lodge a claim in terms of the notice, the creditor runs the risk of having that claim excluded from the liquidation and distribution account. It has become customary to call upon debtors to pay their debts to the estate within the same period, even though this is not prescribed.

=== Advertising the liquidation and distribution account to lie for Inspection ===
In terms of section 35 of the Administration of Estates Act, once the account has been submitted to the Master, it is examined by one of the officials of the Master's Office to establish whether or not it is in order. If it is not found to be in order, the executor will be instructed to amend it to the satisfaction of the Master.

Once it has been approved by the Master, the executor advertises the account to lie for inspection. The advertisements are required to be published on the same date in the Government Gazette and a newspaper that circulates in the district where the deceased was ordinarily resident. If, at any time within twelve months prior to death, the deceased resided in any other district, the advertisement must also appear in a newspaper circulating in that district.

The advertisement must state the dates on which the account will lie for inspection, and the places at which it can be inspected. The account will lie for inspection at the relevant Master's Office, and at the offices of the Magistrate in the district where the deceased was ordinarily resident. If the deceased resided in more than one district during the twelve months prior to death, the account lies at that district's Magistrate as well.

The purpose of the account lying for inspection is to enable any interested party to object to the account if that party is of the opinion that it is incorrect. Any objections to the account must be submitted to the Master, who will then forward the objection to the executor for his comments, in terms of the audi alterem partem principle.

On receipt of the executor's comments, the Master makes a ruling. If the Master is of the opinion that the objection is well founded, the executor will be directed to amend the account. The Master may also refuse to sustain an objection.

Any person aggrieved by the Master's decision may approach the court within thirty days. The court may make any order it deems fit.

A '''like-kind exchange''' under [[Taxation in the United States|United States tax law]], also known as a '''1031 exchange''', is a transaction or series of transactions that allows for the disposal of an asset and the acquisition of another replacement asset without generating a current tax liability from the sale of the first asset.  A like-kind exchange can involve the exchange of one business for another business, one real estate investment property for another real estate investment property, livestock for qualifying livestock, and exchanges of other qualifying assets. Like-kind exchanges have been characterized as [[tax break]]s or "tax loopholes".&lt;ref name=NYT01613 /&gt;

== U.S. Tax Code section 1031 ==
This kind of transaction is also called a "[[1031 exchange]]", because [[Internal Revenue Code section 1031]] of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code allows owners of certain kinds of assets to defer capital gains taxes on any exchange of like-kind properties.  Both the relinquished property and the acquired property must be like-kind, and must be held for business or investment purposes. The sum of assets of each side of the exchange must be equal in value.  [[Taxes]] on [[capital gain]]s are not charged upon sale of a property if a qualifying replacement property is acquired.  The transaction has to be properly structured, including that the taxpayer cannot be deemed to have actually or constructively received the sales price of the relinquished property.  To avoid "constructive receipt" of the sales proceeds, a neutral party is often used to maintain the sales proceeds out of the reach of the taxpayer.  The replacement property generally must be "identified" within 45 days of when the original property is transferred, and must be "acquired" within 180 days of when the original property is transferred.  If the transaction is handled properly, the payment of tax is [[Deferral|deferred]] until the replacement property is later sold with no reinvestment in a qualifying property.  

The idea behind this section of the tax code is that when an individual or a business sells a property to buy another, no economic gain has been achieved.  There has simply been a transfer from one property to another.  For example, if a real estate investor sells an apartment building to buy another one, he or she will not be charged tax on any gains he or she made on the original apartment building.  When the investor sells the original apartment building and purchases a new one, the value used from the original to buy the new one has not changed – the only thing that has changed is where the value resides.

=== Non-recognition provision ===
A like-kind exchange is a type of "non-recognition provision".  According to section 1001(c) of the [[Internal Revenue Code]], all realized gains and losses must be recognized "except as otherwise provided in this subtitle". A like-kind exchange is one of the qualified exceptions, serving as the proto-typical "non-recognition provision".

Non-recognition is conferred on a like-kind exchange on the basis that the form of the taxpayer's investment changes while the substance of the investment does not.  In a like-kind exchange, the realized gain or loss usually never disappears; rather, the unrecognized gain or loss typically carries over into the new asset.  When the new asset is sold or exchanged in a taxable transaction, the realized gain or loss from the first transaction will then be recognized.

== Key considerations ==
Several requirements must be met in a like-kind exchange to ensure that tax liability is not created upon the sale of the first asset:

# The property or asset being sold ("old property") must be held for investment or use in a trade or business, and cannot be a personal residence.
# The property or asset being purchased with the proceeds ("new property") must be "like-kind" to the old property.
# The proceeds from the sale must be used to purchase the new property within 180 days of the sale of old property, although the new property must be identified within 45 days of the sale.
# The investor cannot be in "constructive receipt" of the money from the sale of the old property.

== What is property of "like kind"? ==
One critical issue in a like-kind exchange is defining "property of like kind."  The tax code contains no such definition.  [[treasury regulations|Treasury Regulation § 1.1031(a)-1(b)]] offers a little guidance, suggesting that the term "like kind" refers to "the nature of character of the property and not to its grade or quality".  But the regulation does not further define a property's nature, character, grade or quality.  Rather, it states that "[o]ne kind or class of property may not be exchanged for property of a different kind of class".  

Exchanges of personal property (vehicles, equipment, [[intellectual property rights]]) are subject to more restrictive rules than exchanges of real property, as set forth by [[treasury regulations|Treasury Regulation § 1.1031(a)-2]].  Depreciable personal property is generally considered like-kind to other depreciable personal property that has the same "General Asset Class" in assigning class lives for purposes of depreciation.  For intangible property (and personal property not subject to depreciation), the more general test of "nature or character" applies.  While livestock can qualify for like-kind exchange treatment, livestock of different sexes will not qualify as like-kind.

Six types of property are not eligible for a like-kind exchange: (1) [[stock in trade]] or other property held primarily for sale; (2) [[stock]], [[bond (finance)|bonds]], or notes; (3) other [[securities]] or evidences of [[indebtedness]] or [[interest]]; (4) [[Ownership interest|interests]] in a [[partnership]]; (5) certificates of [[trust law|trust]] or beneficial interests; and (6) choses in action.

== Basis of property acquired ==
The [[unrecognized gain]] or [[unrecognized loss]] from a like-kind exchange is preserved in the new property received in the exchange.  New property receives the basis of the old property, adjusted in value for any other property given or received in the exchange (see below for further discussion of "boot"). 

The taxpayer's [[cost basis|basis]] in the new property is determined by starting with the taxpayer's basis in the old property exchanged.  Adjustments are then made as needed to account for other property that may be received in the exchange.  By using the taxpayer's basis in the old property as the reference point for the new property's basis, unrecognized gain or loss is preserved.

By way of example, let's say a taxpayer exchanges an old asset worth $20,000 in which the taxpayer had a basis of $14,000 for a like-kind asset.  Assuming the exchange qualifies for non-recognition (based on how the taxpayer held the old property and how the taxpayer intends to hold the new property), the $6,000 realized gain will not be recognized, and the taxpayer's basis in the new asset will be $14,000.  Because the new asset likely has a value of $20,000 (in an arms'-length transaction the two assets would be deemed to have equal values), the $6,000 unrecognized gain is preserved in the new asset.  Thus, in any like-kind exchange, the exact amount of any unrecognized gain or loss is preserved in the basis of the asset acquired in the [[Trade|exchange]].

== Other property given or received in the exchange: "boot" ==
Sometimes taxpayers participating in a like-kind exchange receive cash or other property in addition to the like-kind property.  This non-like-kind property is referred to as a "boot", (from the phrase "to boot", as in "I got like-kind property and other property to boot").  However, when that occurs, the taxpayer has not received solely like-kind property.  Fortunately, a "ceiling rule" in [[section 1031]] takes care of this problem by providing that gain or loss is recognized, but only to the extent of the amount of boot received.  

For example, let's say a taxpayer receives like-kind property worth $12,000 and $8,000 in cash in exchange for old property with a basis of $14,000.  The basis in the new property is determined by subtracting the cash received ($8,000) from the basis in the old property ($14,000) and then adding the gain recognized ($6,000).  Thus, upon a cash sale of the new property for its fair market value of $12,000, no gain or loss would result.

== Assumption of taxpayer's liability ==
Property transferred in a like-kind exchange is often encumbered by liabilities and debt, especially where the asset is real estate.  In this regard, the tax code treats relief from indebtedness as additional cash boot in a like-kind exchange.  In other words, the assumption of a taxpayer's debt is treated like the receipt of cash by the taxpayer.

For instance, let's say a taxpayer has an asset worth $20,000 and a basis of $8,000 with a debt in the amount of $4,000.  The taxpayer trades the asset in exchange for like-kind property worth $16,000, and the other party to the exchange expressly assumes the $4,000 liability.  The other party will be unwilling to pay any extra consideration in this transaction, because the taxpayer is receiving $16,000 of equity (property worth $20,000 but subject to a debt of $4,000) in exchange for property worth $16,000.  No extra consideration should be paid.

The receipt of a boot will trigger recognition of gain when gain is realized on the exchange of the original asset, as shown above.  A boot does not trigger recognition when a ''loss'' is realized.

For example: Ashley trades in a business truck with an adjusted basis of $27,000 for another business truck worth $18,000 plus $2,000 of cash. Ashley realizes a $7,000 loss which is all deferred and no gain or loss is recognized.  The $2,000 cash only makes a difference in calculating realized, not recognized loss.

== Loss property ==
While taxpayers generally prefer non-recognition for realized gains (so they do not have to recognize the gain currently and pay the resulting federal income tax currently), they usually prefer to recognize realized losses currently in order to obtain the tax benefit of the resulting deduction sooner.  That means a like-kind exchange is bad news in the case of a realized loss.  None of the loss will be recognized regardless of the boot received.

=== Loss property with a relative ===
Section 267(a) of the tax code disallows deductions for losses resulting from sales to related persons.  However, the basis of the property received by the taxpayer in a like-kind exchange with a relative is governed by section 1031.  In other words, the taint of disallowance under section 267 does not carry over to the new asset.  The loss is preserved in the basis of the new property when the new property is sold.

== Simultaneous three-party like-kind exchanges ==
In many cases, two parties are unable to complete a like-kind exchange alone.  For instance, one party may not wish to receive like-kind property or may wish to recognize loss on property that has declined in value.  The two parties may involve a third party willing to pay cash (perhaps because the new property has a value less than the old property's basis, or because the taxpayer's desire for cash exceeds the desire to minimize liability for federal income taxes).  When a third party willing to pay cash is involved, however, [[Revenue Ruling]] 77-297 indicates that non-recognition will apply if the taxpayer acquires the new property solely for the purpose of exchanging it with property of a like-kind.

== Deferred like-kind exchange: time is money ==
In [[Starker v. United States]], (see [[section 1031]]) the court held that a taxpayer was entitled to [[section 1031]] [[non-recognition]] upon the ultimate receipt of like-kind property, even though the taxpayer in that case had already transferred the property to the buyer and even though the taxpayer had up to five years to identify the replacement property. Congress responded to this ruling by imposing time limits on the identification and receipt of replacement property.

Nowadays, taxpayers must identify the replacement property within 45 days of the transfer of like-kind property.  Taxpayers must also receive the replacement property within 180 days of transfer of like-kind property.

== Reporting ==
Due to periodic changes to the tax code, as well as detailed regulations that contain a number of technical requirements, it is important to check the most current rules and regulations before proceeding with a like-kind exchange.  Current rules require taxpayers to submit an 8824 form to the IRS &lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=179801,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; detailing the terms of the deal.

==As a "tax loophole"==
As of 2013, expansion and exploitation by major corporations of like-kind exchanges, originally intended to relieve family farmers of capital gains tax when swapping land or livestock, to [[tax avoidance|avoid taxes]] was cited by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as an example of the need for [[tax reform]].&lt;ref name=NYT01613&gt;{{cite news|title=Major Companies Push the Limits of a Tax Break|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/business/economy/companies-exploit-tax-break-for-asset-exchanges-trial-evidence-shows.html|accessdate=January 7, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2013|author=David Kocieniewski|quote=With hundreds of thousands of transactions a year, it is hard to gauge the true cost of the tax break for so-called like-kind exchanges, like those used by Cendant, General Electric and Wells Fargo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:+ Smart Net - advertisement offering service packages.png|thumb|right|500px|Portuguese [[Internet service provider]] [[MEO (Portugal)|MEO]] offers to sell additional access to particular data services in this October 2017 advertisement. Many media sources republished this ad as a starting point for discussions about net neutrality.]]

The '''MEO advertisement for data access''' is an advertisement by Portuguese telecommunications provider [[MEO (Portugal)|MEO]] in which the company offers to sell additional access to particular online services beyond a user's general data allotment. The advertisement was the focus of a discussion beginning in October 2017 and covering topics including [[net neutrality]], [[Internet in Portugal]], [[European Union law]], the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], and a range of social issues.

==History==
MEO posted their advertisement for Internet services on their own website. On 26 October 2017, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[United States Representative|U.S. Representative]] [[Ro Khanna]] posted a screenshot of MEO's website to his [[Twitter]] feed while stating that their sales model was a violation of net neutrality and bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khanna|first1=Ro|authorlink=Ro Khanna|title=In Portugal, with no net neutrality, internet providers are starting to split the net into packages|url=https://twitter.com/rokhanna/status/923701871092441088?lang=en|website=@rokhanna|publisher=[[Twitter]]|language=en|date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Khanna's message, the technology community at [[Reddit]] discussed it on 27 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=/r/technology commentators |title=In Portugal, with no net neutrality, internet providers are starting to split the net into packages. This is the future of the Internet if the FCC gets its way. It's not theory.

The '''Martens Clause''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronounced]] {{IPA|/mar'tɛnz/}}) was introduced into the preamble to the 1899 [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]] II &amp;ndash; Laws and Customs of War on Land.&lt;ref name=Hague-II&gt;{{citation  |title= Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague II)]; July 29, 1899 |url= http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/hague02.asp |via=  Avalon Project at [[Yale Law School]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
__NOTOC__
The clause took its name from a declaration read by [[Friedrich Martens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Vladimir |last=Pustogarov |url= https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/article/other/57jn52.htm |title= Fyodor Fyodorovich Martens (1845&amp;ndash;1909) &amp;ndash; a humanist of modern times |date=30 June 1996 |work= International Review of the Red Cross |issue = no 312 |pages=300&amp;ndash;312}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Russian delegate at the Hague Peace Conferences of 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cassese |first=Antonio|title=International Law |publisher=Oxford University Press |place=Oxford  |year=2005 |edition=2 |pages=160–161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It reads as follows:
{{quote|Until a more complete code of the laws of war is issued, the High Contracting Parties think it right to declare that in cases not included in the Regulations adopted by them, populations and belligerents remain under the protection and empire of the principles of international law, as they result from the usages established between civilized nations, from the laws of humanity and the requirements of the public conscience.|Convention with respect to the laws of war on land (Hague II), 29 July 1899.&lt;ref name = "Carnegie"&gt;{{cite book |last= Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |first= |chapter = Conventions de La Haye de 1899 et 1907 concernant les lois  et coutumes de la guerre sur terre |title=Les conventions et déclarations de La Haye de 1899 et de 1907 |publisher= Oxford University Press |place=New York  |year=1919 |pages =101–102 |url= https://archive.org/stream/lesconventionset00laha#page/100/mode/2up |accessdate= 25 October 2017 |via= Internet Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Carnegie-2"&gt;{{cite book |last= Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |editor=Scott, James Brown |chapter = The Hague Convention of 1899 (II) and 1907 (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of  War  on Land  |title=The Hague Conventions and Declarations of 1899 and 1907; Accompanied by Tables of Signatures, Ratifications and Adhesions of the Various Powers, and Texts of Reservations |publisher= Oxford University Press |place=New York  |year=1915 |pages =101–102 |url= https://archive.org/stream/hagueconvention00lawgoog#page/n139/mode/2up |accessdate= 31 October 2017 |via= Internet Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hague-II/&gt;&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{citation |last=Ticehurst |first=Rupert |title=The Martens Clause and the Laws of Armed Conflict |work= International Review of the Red Cross |issue=no 317 |date=30 April 1997 |pages= 125&amp;ndash;134 |url= https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/article/other/57jnhy.htm  |accessdate= 25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Clause appears in a slightly modified form in the 1907 Hague conventions:
{{quote|Until a more complete code of the laws of war has been issued, the High Contracting Parties deem it expedient to declare that, in cases not included in the Regulations adopted by them, the inhabitants and the belligerents remain under the protection and the rule of the principles of the law of nations, as they result from the usages established among civilized peoples, from the laws of humanity, and the dictates of the public conscience.|Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague IV), 18 October 1907&lt;ref name = "Carnegie" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Carnegie-2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  |title= Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague IV)]; October  18, 1907 |url= http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague04.asp |via=  Avalon Project at [[Yale Law School]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Clause was introduced as a compromise wording for the dispute between the [[Great Power]]s who considered [[francs-tireurs]] to be [[unlawful combatants]] subject to execution on capture and smaller states who maintained that they should be considered lawful combatants.&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Ticehurst ([[#References|references]]) in hist footnote 1 cites The life and works of Martens are detailed by V. Pustogarov, "Fyodor Fyodorovich Martens (1845&amp;ndash;1909) — A Humanist of Modern Times", ''International Review of the Red Cross'' (IRRC), No. 312, May&amp;ndash;June 1996, pp. 300&amp;ndash;314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Ticehurst ([[#References|references]]) in hist footnote 2 cites  F. Kalshoven, ''Constraints on the Waging of War'', Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1987, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The clause did not appear in the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Conventions of 1949]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/Commentary_GC_Protocols.pdf ICRC Commentary on the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions] p. 38 ¶ 53&lt;/ref&gt; but was it included in the additional protocols of 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/Commentary_GC_Protocols.pdf ICRC Commentary on the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions] p. 38 ¶ 53; p. 1341 ¶ 4433&lt;/ref&gt; It is in  article 1 paragraph 2 of [[Protocol I]] (which covers international conflicts),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/f6c8b9fee14a77fdc125641e0052b079|title=Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), 8 June 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fourth paragraph of the preamble to [[Protocol II]] (which covers non-international conflicts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/d67c3971bcff1c10c125641e0052b545 |title=Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), 8 June 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wording in both is identical but slightly modified from the version used in the Hague Convention of 1907:&lt;ref&gt;ICRC, Commentary on the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions, p. 38 ¶ 56&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Recalling that, in cases not covered by the law in force, the human person remains under the protection of the principles of humanity and the dictates of the public conscience}}

In its commentary (Geneva 1987), the [[ICRC]] states that although the Martens Clause is considered to be part of customary international law,&lt;ref&gt;ICRC, Commentary on the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions, p. 39 ¶ 56; p 436, footnote 29&lt;/ref&gt; the plenipotentiaries considered its inclusion appropriate because:
{{quote|First, despite the considerable increase in the number of subjects covered by the law of armed conflicts, and despite the detail of its codification, it is not possible for any codification to be complete at any given moment; thus the Martens clause prevents the assumption that anything which is not explicitly prohibited by the relevant treaties is therefore permitted. Secondly, it should be seen as a dynamic factor proclaiming the applicability of the principles mentioned regardless of subsequent developments of types of situation or technology.&lt;ref&gt;ICRC, Commentary on the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions, pp. 38, 39 ¶ 55&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rupert Ticehurst, a Lecturer in Law, at [[King's College London|King's College]] School of Law in London, writes that:
{{quote| The problem faced by humanitarian lawyers is that there is no accepted interpretation of the Martens Clause. It is therefore subject to a variety of interpretations, both narrow and expansive. At its most restricted, the Clause serves as a reminder that customary international law continues to apply after the adoption of a treaty norm.&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Ticehurst ([[#References|references]]) in hist footnote 4 cites C. Greenwood, "Historical Development and Legal Basis", in Dieter Fleck (ed.), ''The Handbook of Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflicts'', Oxford University Press, Oxford/New York, 1995, p. 28 (para. 129).&lt;/ref&gt; A wider interpretation is that, as few international treaties relating to the laws of armed conflict are ever complete, the Clause provides that something which is not explicitly prohibited by a treaty is not ipso facto permitted.&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Ticehurst ([[#References|references]]) in hist footnote 5 cites Y. Sandoz, C. Swinarski, B. Zimmermann (eds.), Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, ICRC/Martinus Nijhoff, Geneva, 1987, p. 39 (para. 55); N.Singh and E. McWhinney, ''Nuclear Weapons and Contemporary International Law'', 2nd ed., Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1989, pp. 46&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt; The widest interpretation is that conduct in armed conflicts is not only judged according to treaties and custom but also to the principles of international law referred to by the Clause.}}

The [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) in their [[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons|advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons]] issued on 8 July 1996, had to consider the general laws of armed conflict before they could consider the specific laws relating to nuclear weapons. Several different interpretations of this clause were presented in oral and written submissions to the ICJ. Although the ICJ advisory opinion did not provide a clear understanding of the Clause, several of submissions to the court provided an insight into its meaning.&lt;ref name=RT/&gt;

The evidence that Ticehurst presents is that just as in 1899 there was a disagreement between the great powers and the minor powers that lead to the formulation of the Clause, so in 1996 a similar divergence of views exists between the declared nuclear powers and the non nuclear powers with the nuclear powers taking a narrow view of the Clause and the non nuclear powers taking a more expansive view.&lt;ref name=RT/&gt;

Ticehurst concludes that:
{{quote| ... By refusing to ratify treaties or to consent to the development of corresponding customary norms, the powerful military States can control the content of the laws of armed conflict. Other States are helpless to prohibit certain technology possessed by the powerful military States. ... the Martens Clause establishes an objective means of determining natural law: the dictates of the public conscience. This makes the laws of armed conflict much richer, and permits the participation of all States in its development. The powerful military States have constantly opposed the influence of natural law on the laws of armed conflict even though these same States relied on natural law for the prosecutions at Nuremberg. The ICJ in its Advisory Opinion did not clarify the extent to which the Martens Clause permits notions of natural law to influence the development of the laws of armed conflict. Consequently, its correct interpretation remains unclear. The Opinion has, however, facilitated an important debate on this significant and frequently overlooked clause of the laws of armed conflict.&lt;ref name=RT/&gt;}}

==Judicial review==
Several national and international courts have considered the Martens Clause when making their judgements. In none of these cases however have the laws of humanity or the dictates of the public conscience been recognised as new and independent right. The clause served rather as general statement for humanitarian principles as well as guideline to the understanding and interpretation of existing rules of international law.

The Martens Clause was quoted in the following judicial rulings:

== History ==
[[File:McAfee logo.png|thumb|Former McAfee logo with the Intel byline.]]

=== Early years ===
The company was founded in 1987 as McAfee Associates, named for its founder [[John McAfee]], who resigned from the company in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bernabeo | first =Paul  | title = Inventors and Inventions, Volume 4| url = https://books.google.com/?id=YcPvV893aXgC| year = 2008| publisher = Marshall Cavendish | isbn = 0761477675| page = 1033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  McAfee was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1992.  Network Associates was formed in 1997 as a merger of McAfee Associates, [[NetScout Systems, Inc.|Network General]], [[PGP Corporation]] and [[Helix Software]].

The company restructured in 2004, beginning with the sale of its [[Magic Solutions, Inc.|Magic Solutions]] business to [[Remedy Corporation|Remedy]], a subsidiary of [[BMC Software]] early in the year.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} In mid-2004, the company sold the Sniffer Technologies business to a venture capital backed firm named [[Network General]] (the same name as the original owner of Sniffer Technologies), and changed its name back to McAfee to reflect its focus on security-related technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Computer Desktop Encyclopedia|title=McAfee|url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/mcafee|website=TheFreeDictionary.com|publisher=The Computer Language Co. Inc.|accessdate=7 May 2018|location=Pennsylvania (US)|date=1981-2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open source ===
Among other companies bought and sold by McAfee is [[Trusted Information Systems]], which developed the Firewall Toolkit, the [[free software]] foundation for the commercial Gauntlet Firewall, which was later sold to [[Secure Computing Corporation]].

McAfee, as a result of brief ownership of TIS Labs/NAI Labs/Network Associates Laboratories/McAfee Research, was highly influential in the world of [[Open Source]] software, as that organization produced portions of the [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], and [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] operating systems, and developed portions of the [[BIND]] name server software and [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]] version 3.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

=== Encryption technologies ===
McAfee had acquired [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], Canada-based [[FSA Corporation]], which helped the company diversify its security offerings away from just client-based [[antivirus]] software by bringing on board its own network and desktop encryption technologies.

The FSA team also oversaw the creation of a number of other technologies that were leading edge at the time, including [[Firewall (computer)|firewall]], [[file encryption]], and [[public key infrastructure]] product lines. While those product lines had their own individual successes including PowerBroker (written by Dean Huxley and Dan Freedman and now sold by [[BeyondTrust]]), the growth of antivirus ware always outpaced the growth of the other security product lines. It is fair to say that McAfee remains best known for its anti-virus and anti-spam products.

=== Acquisition by Intel and spin-off ===
On August 19, 2010, [[Intel]] announced that it would purchase McAfee for $48 a share in a deal valued at $7.68&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2010/08/19/intel-to-acquire-mcafee |title=Intel to Acquire McAfee |date=August 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 19, 2010 |publisher=[[Intel Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Johnson |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_15826282/2010-intel-buy-mcafee-purchase-security-software |title=2010: Intel to buy McAfee: Chip giant to acquire software maker for $7.68B – The Mercury News |website=Mercurynews.com |date= |accessdate=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 2014, Intel CEO [[Brian Krzanich]] announced during the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] the name change from McAfee Security to Intel Security. The company's red shield logo would remain, with the firm continuing to operate as a wholly owned Intel subsidiary.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harmsworth|first1=Vere|title=CES 2014: Intel's security rebranding sheds Mcafee name|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/ces/10556534/CES-2014-Intels-security-rebranding-sheds-Mcafee-name.html|accessdate=January 5, 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; John McAfee, who no longer has any involvement in the company, expressed his pleasure at his name no longer being associated with the software. "I am now everlastingly grateful to Intel for freeing me from this terrible association with the worst software on the planet. These are not my words, but the words of millions of irate users."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25631183 |title=CES 2014: Director loses direction as teleprompter fails |publisher=BBC News |date=January 7, 2014 |accessdate=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2016 the products still bore the McAfee name.

The company was spun back out of Intel on April 4, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2017/04/04/intel-mcafee-spinoff-security/ |title=McAfee Returns to Its Roots After Intel Spin-Out |publisher=Time, Inc. |date=April 4, 2017 |accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late December 2006 both Weiss and Samaneuk had share option grant prices revised upwards by McAfee's board. Weiss and Roberts were both exonerated of all wrongdoing from the claims of McAfee in 2009.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
* On April 21, 2010, beginning at approximately 14:00 UTC, millions of computers worldwide running Windows XP Service Pack 3 were affected by an erroneous virus definition file update by McAfee, resulting in the removal of a Windows system file ([[svchost.exe]]) on those machines, causing machines to lose network access and, in some cases, enter a reboot loop. McAfee rectified this by removing and replacing the faulty DAT file, version 5958, with an emergency DAT file, version 5959 and has posted a fix for the affected machines in their consumer knowledge base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=8656|title=McAfee DAT 5958 Update Issues|date=April 21, 2010|accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/04/21/mcafee-update--shutting-down-xp-machines/|title=Botched McAfee update shutting down corporate XP machines worldwide|website=Engadget.com|date=April 21, 2010|accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Michigan's medical school reported  that 8,000 of its 25,000 computers crashed.

The '''Monckton Commission''', officially the '''Advisory Commission for the Review of the Constitution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland''', was set up by the British government under the chairmanship of [[Walter Monckton, 1st Viscount Monckton of Brenchley]], in 1960. Its purpose was to investigate and make proposals for the future of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] (or Central African Federation), made up of [[Southern Rhodesia]], [[Northern Rhodesia]] and [[Nyasaland]]—respectively equivalent to today's Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1960/nov/16/the-monckton-commission-report|title=THE MONCKTON COMMISSION REPORT (Hansard, 16 November 1960)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conclusion of the Report==
The Commission concluded that the Federation could not be maintained except by force or through massive changes in racial legislation. It advocated a majority of black African members in the Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesian legislatures and giving these territories the option to leave the Federation after five years.&lt;ref&gt;R Blake, (1977). A History of Rhodesia, Knopf P.331. {{ISBN|0-394-48068-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P Murray, (2005). British Documents on the End of Empire: Central Africa, Part I, Volume 9, pp.lxxiv-v, lxxx. {{ISBN|978-0-11290-586-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released in October 1960, the report advocated sweeping changes to be made to the federal structure, including black African majorities in the Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesian legislatures. The Federal Prime Minister [[Roy Welensky|Sir Roy Welensky]] was outraged when the report was published, calling it the "death knell of federation" and rejecting it out of hand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871761,00.html ''Collapsing Bastion''] (24 October 1960), ''Time Magazine''; accessed 21 May  2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Black nationalist opinion was just as opposed, but on different grounds. All nationalists wanted an end to federation, and independence for the territories as black-majority-ruled states.

The Monckton Commission toured the Federation in February 1960. It had been given limited terms of reference and was boycotted by the opposition Labour Party and the black nationalists in Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. As the Commission's composition seemed weighted towards a continuation of the Federation, its report disappointed the British government. The Monckton Commission reported widespread and sincere opposition to the Federation in the two northern territories. It considered Federation could not survive without at least a major devolution of powers to Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia, giving more voting rights to black Africans and lessening racial discrimination. Most importantly, it also recommended that Britain should retain the right to allow the secession of either northern territory, recognising that black nationalists would not accept even a modified Federation.

The British government broadly accepted Monckton's report, and this signaled a withdrawal of support for the Federation and the acceptance of early majority rule for Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. Accordingly, and despite opposition from [[Robert Perceval Armitage|Sir Robert Armitage]], the [[Governor of Nyasaland]], from the Governments of the Federation and of Southern Rhodesia, and from some colleagues in the cabinet, Colonial Secretary [[Iain Macleod]] released [[Hastings Banda]] from detention on 1 April 1960 and immediately began to negotiate with him on Nyasaland's constitutional future. The state of emergency was lifted on 16 June 1960.&lt;ref&gt;C Baker, (1997). Nyasaland, 1959: A Police State? Vol. 50, No. 2, pp. 23–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Malawi Congress Party]] was formed in 1959 as the successor to the banned Nyasaland African Congress, with Banda as leader. Following an overwhelming Malawi Congress Party victory in August 1961 elections, preparations were made for Nyasaland's independence, which was achieved on 6 July 1964 under the name Malawi.&lt;ref&gt;J McCracken, (2012) A History of Malawi, 1859–1966, pp. 367–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conference to review the Federal Constitution==
The Federation was created under a British [[Act of Parliament]] of 1953 which made provision for a conference to be held at some time during the period 1960 to 1962 to review the Federal Constitution. The United Kingdom and Federal Government and the governments of the three constituent territories were to be represented, and any Federal Bill to amend the Constitution required the votes of two-thirds of the members of the Federal Assembly and had also to gain the assent of the United Kingdom parliament before becoming law. If the such proposed amendment were objected to by one or more of the territorial Legislatures, the British government could not override that objection if either House of Parliament resolved to accept it.&lt;ref&gt;G H Baxter and P W Hodgens, (1957). The Constitutional Status of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, International Affairs, Vol. 33, No. 4, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the report of the Monckton Commission, which suggested an early conference on the Federal Constitution, the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Lord Kilmuir]] stated the British government’s position on the future of the Federation. He accepted that it had no power to intervene in the internal affairs of Southern Rhodesia, but said that Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland remained the British government’s responsibility. Kilmuir also stated that the Act of Parliament that created the Federation expressly reserved to the British parliament the right to make such provision for the Federation’s future as it saw fit.&lt;ref&gt; J J B Somerville, (1963). The Central African Federation, International Affairs, Vol. 39, No. 3, p. 394-5&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It had been agreed between the British and Federal governments in 1957 that a Federal Review Conference on future of Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland would be held in 1960, and this began in London, on 5 December 1960. However, the Federal talks were suspended on 16 December 1960 so that talks could be held on constitutional developments in two of the three constituent territories. These continued until February 1961, but did not include Nyasaland, as [[Hastings Banda]], who only attended the conference with extreme reluctance, walked out on 12 December. The talks also failed to produce a workable constitutional solution for Northern Rhodesia; Banda’s success in the Nyasaland elections of August 1961 made it inevitable that Nyasaland at least would leave the Federation.&lt;ref&gt; J J B Somerville, (1963). The Central African Federation, International Affairs, Vol. 39, No. 3, pp. 397-8&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The conference did little except to make clear the views (opinions only, with no actual supporting statistics at this point) of [[Hastings Banda|Banda]] for Nyasaland and [[Kenneth Kaunda|Kaunda]] for Northern Rhodesia that Africans in the northern two territories wanted to leave the Federation, and of [[Joshua Nkomo]] that the Afrcan majority in Southern Rhodesia wanted majority rule. .&lt;ref&gt; J J B Somerville, (1963). The Central African Federation, International Affairs, Vol. 39, No. 3, p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Insurance Act 1911''' created [[National Insurance]], originally a system of health insurance for industrial workers in Great Britain based on contributions from employers, the government, and the workers themselves. It was one of the foundations of the modern welfare state. It also provided unemployment insurance for designated cyclical industries. It formed part of the wider [[Liberal welfare reforms|social welfare reforms]] of the [[Liberal Government 1905–15|Liberal Government]] of 1906&amp;ndash;1915. [[David Lloyd George]], the Liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer,  was the prime moving force behind its design, negotiations with doctors and other interest groups, and final passage.

==Background==
Lloyd George followed the example of Germany, which under conservative Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] had provided compulsory national insurance against sickness from 1884. After visiting Germany in 1908, Lloyd George said in his 1909 Budget speech that Britain should aim to be "putting ourselves in this field on a level with Germany; we should not emulate them only in armaments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maggie Craig|title=When the Clyde Ran Red|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Te3ltQFNHAsC&amp;pg=PT26|year=2011|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His measure gave the British working classes the first contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment. The Act only applied to wage earners—about 70% of the work force—their families and the unwaged were not covered.&lt;ref name = "Grigg"&gt;[[John Grigg (writer)|John Grigg]], ''Lloyd George, The People's Champion, 1902-1911'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|313–51}}

After first praising the proposal, the Conservatives split, and most voted against it. But when returned to office they did not change it.

Some trade unions who operated their own insurance schemes, and [[friendly societies]] who had their own schemes, at first opposed the proposal, but Lloyd George convinced most of them to support it. The friendly societies and trade unions were given a major role in administering health insurance. Covered workers outside those agencies dealt with the local post office. The government picked up responsibility for the basic benefits that the unions and societies had promised, thus greatly helping their financial reserves.&lt;ref name = "Grigg"/&gt;{{rp|325}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Clinton|title=The Trade Union Rank and File: Trades Councils in Britain, 1900-40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aD-8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA48|year=1977|publisher=Manchester UP|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was psychologically important, as it removed the need for unemployed workers to rely on the stigmatised social welfare provisions of the [[Poor Law]]. This hastened the end of the Poor Law as a social welfare provider: the [[Poor law union|Poor Law Unions]] were abolished in 1929, and the administration of poor relief was transferred to the counties and county boroughs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eh.net/encyclopedia/english-poor-laws/|title=English Poor Laws|website=eh.net|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key figures in the implementation of the Act included [[Robert Laurie Morant]] and especially economist William Braithwaite, who drafted the details after inspecting the German system.&lt;ref name = "Grigg"/&gt;{{rp|321–24}}

The medical profession was angry with the law, despite support from some prominent leaders such as [[Victor Horsley]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Dunnill, "Victor Horsley (1857–1915) and National Insurance." ''[[Journal of Medical Biography]]'' 21.4 (2013): 249-254.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics on the right such as [[Hilaire Belloc]] considered the Act to be a manifestation of ''[[The Servile State]]'', which Belloc blasted in his book of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5xW2Q2Oj1YsC|title=Political Ideas in Modern Britain: In and After the Twentieth Century|last=Barker|first=Rodney|date=2013-01-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134910663|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Part I, Health==
[[File:National-insurance-act-1911.jpg|thumb|right|Leaflet promoting the National Insurance Act 1911]]
[[File:Health-Doctors-Cartoons-Punch-1911-06-14-461.jpg|thumb|''[[The Doctor (painting)|The Doctor]]'' by Luke Fildes used in a 1911 ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon commenting on the effects of the act.&lt;ref name=punch&gt;''Punch'', 14 June 1911, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The National Insurance Act Part I provided for a [[National Insurance]] scheme with provision of medical benefits. All workers who earned under £160 a year had to pay 4 [[old pence|pence]] a week to the scheme; the employer paid 3 pence, and general taxation paid 2 pence (Lloyd George called it the "ninepence for fourpence"). Under the Act, workers could take sick leave and be paid 10 [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]]s a week for the first 13 weeks, and 5 shillings a week for the next 13 weeks. Workers also gained access to free treatment for tuberculosis, and the sick were eligible for treatment by a panel doctor. Due to pressure from the [[Co-operative Women's Guild]], the National Insurance Act provided maternity benefits.

In parts of Scotland whose economy was still largely based on subsistence farming, the collection of cash contributions was impractical. The [[Highlands and Islands Medical Service]] was established in the [[crofting counties]] on a non-contributory basis in 1913.

Though the fund was held centrally, and the obligation to pay into it was a nationally imposed one, access to the scheme was via ''[[Approved society|Approved Societies]]'', who collected the contributions, paid out for treatment, and provided day-to-day administration. A worker could choose which Approved Society to belong to; this stimulated competition between the societies. Any organisation could become an Approved Society, as long as it was registered under the Act, and complied with the Act's obligations, including to operate on a not-for-profit basis. As well as societies created by the Trade Unions, and [[friendly society|friendly societies]], commercial insurers also established Approved Societies, such as the [[National Amalgamated Approved Society]] (created by [[Phoenix Group|Pearl Assurance]] and others); the largest Approved Societies were the four operated by [[Prudential plc|Prudential]], which collectively looked after 4.3 million members.

The 1911 Act only allowed Approved Societies to collect the contributions of their members; they could not keep the money, but had to forward it to the National Insurance Fund. The societies' own expenditure, such as the cost of treatment for their members, would be reimbursed by the Fund, on a six-monthly basis. The government did not reimburse any "improper" payments, such as "treatments" that did not comply with government regulations, or corrupt payments.

Many Approved Societies were nominally profitable, contributing more to the National Insurance Fund than they took out. In 1925, and then 1931, further Acts were passed which reduced the government contribution to the Fund: the government pressured the backers of Approved Societies (the insurance companies, trade unions, and so on) to take on the financial burden themselves. Together with increasing government control on which treatments they were allowed to fund, this led many Societies to complain that they had become little more than branches of government, and membership attendance at society meetings dwindled away, becoming virtually non-existent by 1940. The National Insurance Act 1946 introduced a single national organisation in the healthcare field (the [[National Health Service]]) which, among other things, fulfilled the role of the Approved Societies; Approved Societies thus became redundant, and ceased to exist in 1948.

==Part II, Unemployment==
The National Insurance Act Part II provided for time-limited unemployment benefit for certain highly cyclical industries, especially the building trades, mechanical engineering, foundries, vehicle manufacturing, and sawmills. The scheme was based on actuarial principles, and it was planned that it would be funded by fixed payments from workers, employers, and taxpayers. It made no provision for dependants. Part II worked in a similar way to Part I. The worker gave 2{{frac|1|2}}d (i.e pre-decimal pence) per week while employed, the employer 2{{frac|1|2}}d, and the taxpayer 3d. After one week of unemployment, the worker would start to be eligible to receive 7 shillings (i.e. 84d) per week for up to 15 weeks in a year. The money would be collected from labour exchanges. By 1913, 2.3 million were insured under the scheme for unemployment benefit and almost 15 million insured for sickness benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy T. Hellwig, "The Origins of Unemployment Insurance in Britain." ''Social Science History'' 29#1 (2005): 107-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

A key assumption of the Act was an unemployment rate of 4.6%. At the time the Act was passed, unemployment was at 3% and the fund was expected to quickly build a surplus. Under the Act, employees' contributions to the scheme were to be compulsory and taken by the employer before the workers' salary was paid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12702">In [[English law]], the defense of '''necessity''' recognizes that there may be situations of such overwhelming urgency that a person must be allowed to respond by breaking the law. There have been very few cases in which the [[necessity (criminal law)|defence of necessity]] has succeeded, and in general terms there are very few situations where such a defence could even be applicable. The defining feature of such a defense is that the situation is not caused by another person (which would fall under either duress or self-defence) and that the accused was in genuine risk of immediate harm or danger. 

For the most part crimes that could be justified as necessary are minor in nature, such as driving over the speed limit to reach medical care, or damaging property to escape a fire. In almost all cases where a serious crime has taken place, necessity is unlikely to be a successful defence as courts have mostly taken the view that directly harming another person could not be justified even by extreme circumstances unless it directly prevented immediate serious harm or death. Even if a person were already likely to die, and their death would allow others to survive, killing them is not necessary until the point where harm is imminently likely to occur to the others and if that harm is not immediate, then necessity cannot apply. As such the circumstances where necessity could apply to a serious crime are extremely narrow, involving two or more people in an immediately life-threatening situation where only one could survive. Even in this situation, as the law does allow for a person not to take actions that would save another person if to do so would put their own life at risk, it is seldom strictly necessary for one person to kill another, one allowing the other to die in the course of the situation, then saving themselves. 

The [[Crown Prosecution Service]] has historically chosen to exercise its discretion not to prosecute those cases where it believes potential defendants have acted reasonably in all the circumstances, and as such where necessity is a strong defense.

==History==
This defence was used in the early [[trial (law)|trial]] of ''[[Regina v. Dudley &amp; Stephens]]'' (1884) [[Case citation|14 QBD 273 DC]], where four [[shipwreck]]ed [[sailor]]s were cast adrift in a small boat without provisions. To save themselves, the three strongest decided to [[eating|eat]] the fourth, the 17-year-old [[cabin boy]]. The [[court]] ruled that [[cannibalism|cannibalising]] the boy was not urgently necessary. Even though the cabin boy would almost certainly have died of [[natural causes]], the sailors killed the boy intentionally and were [[culpability|guilt]]y of [[murder]]. There was some degree of necessity arising from the threat of [[starvation]] but, at any moment, a ship could have sailed over the horizon to save them as, indeed, the three were rescued. Since they could never be sure that the killing was actually necessary from one minute to the next, the defence was denied. Cannibalism itself is not an offence so long as the death occurs naturally.

Dudley and Stephens were convicted of murder and sentenced to be hanged, however their sentence was later reduced to just six months in prison.  The third man, Brooks, was not tried, as he had not participated in the murder. The principles from this case form the basis of the defence of necessity not being available for murder.

==The principles==
There must be an urgent and immediate threat to life which creates a situation in which the defendant reasonably believes that a proportionate response to that threat is to break the law. This reflects the distinction between the defenses of necessity and [[duress]] in that the former is pressure of circumstances arising naturally, whereas the latter is a threat from an entirely human agency that overpowers the will of the defendant. The general approach was laid down by [[Tom Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] in ''Southwark London Borough Council v Williams'' (1971) 2 AER 175 that necessity should be denied as a general defence because otherwise anarchy and disorder would follow. If hunger was allowed to become the basis of necessity, any poor person might seek to justify [[burglary]] to steal food by arguing that he or she had reasonably believed that this was a proportionate response to the threat of malnutrition. Thus, the fact that hunger does not arise spontaneously, and there are other ways in which to seek relief from poverty (e.g. work or by seeking welfare support or charity),  would deny the defense of necessity. The Canadian courts put the issue succinctly. In [[Perka v. The Queen|Perka v The Queen]] (1984) 2 SCR 232, Dickson J. held at p250 that
:If the defense of necessity is to form a valid and consistent part of our criminal law it must, as has been universally recognised, be strictly controlled and scrupulously limited to situations that correspond to its underlying rationale.
When considering necessity in ''R v Cole'' (1994) Crim. LR 582 Simon Brown LJ. held that the peril relied on to support the plea of necessity lacked imminence and the degree of directness and immediacy required of the link between the suggested peril and the offense charged. This defendant robbed two building societies in order to repay debts. The form of defense was "duress by circumstance" which attempts to extend the coverage of duress by borrowing the idea of an uncontrollable external circumstance forcing a choice by the defendant to break the law.

==Medical necessity==
In ''Quayle and Others v R; Attorney General's Reference (No. 2 of 2004)'' (2005) EWCA Crim 1415 each defendant appealed convictions associated variously with the cultivation or possession of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] resin to be used for pain management. The choice facing the appellants was not severe pain without cannabis or absence of pain with cannabis, rather it was absence of pain with adverse side effects without cannabis, and absence of pain with minimal side effects with cannabis. The difference was restricted to the adverse side effects which, however unpleasant, could not sensibly be said to raise a ''[[prima facie]]'' possibility of serious injury, let alone one such as would overwhelm the will of the defendant. There was no evidence from an objective stand point that the appellants were acting reasonably and proportionately to a threat of injury. The evidence was clear that it was possible for the appellants to control pain by conventional and legal means. To admit the medical use of cannabis on the ground of necessity would defeat the legislative purpose underpinning the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]. Further, for the defence of necessity to succeed, the threat of injury must be immediate and imminent, and come from an extraneous source. The parties were responding to continuous pain over a period of time and, in any event, pain is too subjective to qualify as an external threat. There was nothing urgent that overwhelmed their will to resist. The parties then argued that the law breached Article 8 [[European Convention on Human Rights]] by interfering with the right of privacy. Interference with the right of respect for private life is permissible under Article 8(2) if "in accordance with the law and . . .. necessary in a democratic society . . ... for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others". Within the limits indicated in ''Taylor (Joseph) v Lancashire County Council'' (2005) EWCA Civ 284, the court's decision would involve an evaluation of the medical and scientific evidence, but their conclusion was that this was a policy matter more properly within the remit of the relevant Minister. Thus, this unlawful self-help did not qualify as necessity and did not fall within the protection of Article 8 ECHR.

In ''Altham'' (2006) EWCA Crim 7 the defendant used cannabis for pain relief following injury in a road accident. He was charged with possession under s5(2) [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]. The judge at first instance refused to leave the defence of [[medical necessity]] to the jury so the defendant changed his plea to guilty. The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] held that Article 3 ECHR not to subject a person to inhuman or degrading treatment does apply to the State. The defendant argued that using cannabis was the only way in which his symptoms could be alleviated and that he could not do so without committing a criminal offence. Thus, the State, by prosecuting him, subjected him to degrading treatment. The Court said that the State, by refusing cannabis, neither did nor refrained from doing anything that would subject the defendant to degrading treatment. The State had done nothing to change the defendant's condition for better or worse, and there was nothing to require the Court to read the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 as subject to a defence of medical necessity. The Court applied ''Quayle'' where the focus was on Article 8, and the defence of necessity was denied because it would be in conflict with the purpose and effect of the legislative scheme.

In ''[[Re A (Children) (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation)]]'' (2000) 4 AER 961 Jodie and Mary were ischiopagus conjoined twins (i.e. joined at the pelvis) and the Court of Appeal had to decide whether it was lawful to perform surgery to separate them, when the separation would kill Mary. If the operation did not take place there was evidence that both would die within six months. The court proceeded on the basis that the potential charge would be murder in that, although the girls were physically joined, they were separate "lives in being". The court decided that the operation would be lawful. [[Alan Ward (judge)|Ward LJ]] concluded that, by analogy with self-defence, it was lawful to kill Mary because she was, albeit lawfully, killing Jodie. Ward reasoned that causing Mary's death did not breach the [[public policy (law)|public policy]] of "sanctity of life" because of the "quasi self-defence", but Brooke LJ, rejected self-defence because Mary was not unlawfully threatening Jodie's life. He concluded that necessity rather than duress of circumstances would apply because the doctor's will was not being overwhelmed by the threat. Instead, the doctors were making a rational choice to adopt the lesser of two evils, i.e. the death of one rather than the death of both twins. Ward LJ. reasoned that separation surgery was clearly in Jodie's best interests, but not in Mary's best interests, because it denied her "inherent right to life." Given the conflict of the children's interests and the consequent conflict in the doctor's duties to each child, there was "no other way of dealing with it than by choosing the lesser of the two evils and so finding the least detrimental alternative." Jodie could benefit from the surgery to enjoy probably a near normal life; refusal to allow separation would result in the death of both twins. So "the least detrimental alternative" was to allow separation. Necessity would not usually be allowed as a defence to murder, but Brooke LJ. distinguished [[Regina v. Dudley and Stephens|Dudley &amp; Stephens]] on the basis that the doctors were not selecting the victim unlike the cabin boy in ''Dudley''. The decision is restricted to cases of medical necessity and a conflict of duty owed both by doctors to different patients and by parents to their children, but does provide an interesting expansion of the law albeit, as Michalowski (2001) comments, it poses difficult questions as to who should take such decisions on behalf of patients.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31520">'''Regulation S-X''' is a prescribed regulation in the United States of America that lays out the specific form and content of [[financial reports]], specifically the financial statements of public companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/regS-X/SX1-02.html Accounting Rules, Form and Content of Financial Statements]&lt;/ref&gt; It is cited as 17 C.F.R. Part 210; the name of the part is "Form and Content of and Requirements for Financial Statements, [[Securities Act of 1933]], [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], [[Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935]], [[Investment Company Act of 1940]], [[Investment Advisers Act of 1940]], and [[Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975]]".

Regulation S-X and the Financial Reporting Releases ([https://www.sec.gov/interps/account.shtml  Staff Accounting Bulletins]) set forth the form and content of and requirements for [[financial statements]] required to be filed as a part of (a) registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933 and (b) registration statements under section 12,&lt;ref&gt;[http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/sec12.html Section 12 -- Registration Requirements for Securities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907171919/http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/sec12.html |date=2010-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; annual or other reports under sections 13&lt;ref&gt;[http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/sec13.html  Section 13 -- Periodical and Other Reports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906105806/http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/sec13.html |date=2010-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 15(d)&lt;ref&gt;[http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/sec15.html  Section 15 -- Registration and Regulation of Brokers and Dealers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907171924/http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/sec15.html |date=2010-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and proxy and information statements under section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; except as otherwise specifically provided in the forms.

Regulation S-X is seen less frequently but is equally valid for (c) registration statements, annual reports and shareholder reports filed under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and likewise for (d) the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Regulation S-X extends the meaning of the term 'financial statements' to include all notes to the statements and all related schedules. Regulation S-X is closely related to [[Regulation S-K]], which lays out reporting requirements for various SEC filings and registrations used by public companies. Regulation S-X profoundly affects internal and external [[accountants]] and [[auditors]], and directors and officers and numerous officials, employees and contractors of publicly reporting companies, and because of the need for accurate reporting of monies and other data, any operation of a company may be affected to require ultimate [[Compliance (regulation)|compliance]] with Regulation S-X and the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]].

There is no levity in Regulation S-X and it does not make for light reading; it is commonly viewed at [https://web.archive.org/web/20100911224042/http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/regS-X/index.html  Securities Lawyers Deskbook: Regulation S-X]. There is more to read to be thoroughly familiar with Regulation S-X and the SEC Division of Corporation Finance provides an unofficial 329-page (as of April 2, 2009) tome - with no pictures - named the [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cffinancialreportingmanual.pdf  Financial Reporting Manual.]

Also available from the SEC are:
[https://www.sec.gov/interps/account.shtml  Selected Staff Accounting Bulletins] and 
[https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cfguidance.shtml   Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations].
   
Regulation S-X generally implicitly discusses [[US GAAP]]. However, non-GAAP measures are sometimes used by companies to provide insight into its business. Non-GAAP financial measures are defined in Regulation G. Regulations G and Item 10e of Regulation S-K provide guidance on the use of non-GAAP measures.  In May 2016 the SEC also issued additional Compliance &amp; Disclosure Interpretations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pwc.com/us/en/cfodirect/publications/in-brief/sec-non-gaap-financial-measures.html|title=In brief: SEC updates interpretive guidance on non-GAAP financial measures|last=PricewaterhouseCoopers|access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; related to the rules and regulations on the use of non-GAAP financial measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pwc.com/us/en/cfodirect/publications/point-of-view/non-gaap-measures-other-kpis.html|title=Point of view: Building confidence in non-GAAP measures and other KPIs|last=PricewaterhouseCoopers|access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulation S-X was devised by the SEC staff with copious input from accounting-related entities. Major entities such as:

==Application of Regulation S-X (Rules 1-01, 1-02)==
Because Regulation S-X is large and its impact on financial report is so pervasive, it is important to have a consistent [[terminology]] and to get it right from the beginning so that words and phrases have the same meaning throughout. Among other terms, certain basic terms are assigned meanings. For examples: Accountant's report, Amount, [[Certified]], Control, Fiscal Year, Share, Wholly Owned Subsidiary, and so on.

A specific meaning is also given for "Summarized financial information".

A specific meaning is not given for the complex term ''Internal control over financial reporting'', but reference is made to [http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34ActRls/rule13a-15.html#f Rule 13a-15(f)]. As the failure to have such controls or properly implement them or use/provide their disclosure may come with [[sanctions (law)|penalties]] and since this phrase pervades thinking and rule-making in the securities industry, it is worth viewing this definition, a definition that requires management to be pro-active:

{{quote|The term ''internal control over financial reporting'' is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the issuer's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the issuer's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with [[generally accepted accounting principles]] and includes those policies and procedures that:

1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer;

2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the issuer; and

3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.}}

==Qualifications and reports of accountants==

Qualifications and Reports of Accountants (Rules 2-01 to 2-07)[http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/regS-X/art2.html]

After laying out some basic and important definitions in [[Rule 1-02]], Regulation S-X kicks off in Rule 2-01 (Qualifications of Accountants) by considering accountants and auditors and states who is acceptable to the SEC to act as such. Accountants and auditors must be properly registered in their own jurisdiction: "The Commission will not recognize any person as a certified public accountant who is not duly registered and in good standing as such under the laws of the place of his residence or principal office."

Further, one issue that matters critically is independence of the auditor from the client company. Final Rule 33-8183, (https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-8183.htm, January 28, 2003) while discussing audit services, non-audit services and auditor/accountant independence, 
*revised the Commission's regulations related to the non-audit services that, if provided to an audit client, would impair an accounting firm's independence;
*required that an issuer's [[audit committee]] pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided to the issuer by the auditor of an issuer's financial statements;
*prohibited certain partners on the audit engagement team from providing audit services to the issuer for more than *five or seven consecutive years, depending on the partner's involvement in the audit, except that certain small accounting firms may be exempted from this requirement;
*prohibited an accounting firm from auditing an issuer's financial statements if certain members of management of that issuer had been members of the accounting firm's audit engagement team within the one-year period preceding the commencement of audit procedures;
*require that the auditor of an issuer's financial statements report certain matters to the issuer's audit committee, including "critical" accounting policies used by the issuer; and require disclosures to investors of information related to audit and non-audit services provided by, and fees paid to, the auditor of the issuer's financial statements.
*In addition, under the final rules, an accountant would not be independent from an audit client if an audit partner received compensation based on selling engagements to that client for services other than audit, review and attest services.

{{quote|The Commission's principles of independence with respect to services provided by auditors are largely predicated on three basic principles, violations of which would impair the auditor's independence:

(1) an auditor cannot function in the role of management,

(2) an auditor cannot audit his or her own work, and

(3) an auditor cannot serve in an advocacy role for his or her client.}}

To be extra clear about it, Sarbanes–Oxley lays out the nine impermissibles—that is the nine categories of prohibited non-audit services for auditors:
# [[Bookkeeping]] or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of the audit client;
# Financial information [[systems design]] and implementation;
# [[Economic appraisal|Appraisal]] or valuation services, [[fairness opinion]]s, or contribution-in-kind reports;
# [[Actuarial| Actuarial services]];
# [[Internal audit]] outsourcing services;
# Management functions or human resources;
# Broker or dealer, investment adviser, or [[investment banking]] services;
# Legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit; and
# Any other service that the company's board determines, by regulation, is impermissible.

Here is where the SEC places the ''corporate'' onus: "The final rules recognize the critical role played by audit committees in the financial reporting process and the unique position of audit committees in assuring auditor independence  " ... because of "the unique ability and responsibility of the audit committee to insulate the auditor from the pressures that may be exerted by management."

The result of Final Rule 33-8183 was to add Rule 2-07 to Regulation S-X and to amend [[Rule 2-01]] of Regulation S-X, as well as affect several other regulations, rules and forms.

These changes were triggered mainly by the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] of 2002, enacted on July 30, 2002. Title II of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, entitled "Auditor Independence" required the Commission to adopt, by January 26, 2003, final rules such as 33-8183.

Section 201 of Sarbanes–Oxley require that non-audit services that are not prohibited under the Sarbanes–Oxley Act and the Commission's rules be subject to pre-approval by the registrant's audit committee. These rules specify the requirements for obtaining such pre-approval from the registrant's audit committee. Section 202 of Sarbanes–Oxley requires an audit committee to pre-approve allowable non-audit services and specifies certain exceptions to the requirement to obtain pre-approval. These rules specify the requirements of the registrant's audit committee for pre-approving non-audit services by the auditor of the registrant's financial statements.

Thus it can be seen that the audit committee membership is not a reward for good behavior or a [[sinecure]] but rather a weighty responsibility flowing from the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, various SEC regulations, rules and Final Rules, to also discharge the responsibilities of Regulations S-X and Regulation S-K.

Qualifications and Reports of Accountants
* 210.2-01   Qualifications of accountants.
* 210.2-02   Accountants' reports and attestation reports.
* 210.2-02T  Accountants' reports and attestation reports on internal control over financial reporting.
* 210.2-03   Examination of financial statements by foreign government auditors.
* 210.2-04   Examination of financial statements of persons other than the registrant.
* 210.2-05   Examination of financial statements by more than one accountant.
* 210.2-06   Retention of audit and review records.
* 210.2-07   Communication with audit committees.

After this initial section where the SEC lays out the requirements and limitations on interaction between company, management, audit committee, accountants and the auditor, Regulation S-X is then free to carry on and discuss the form and content of financial statements and financial reporting. Among other things [[Rule 210.2-06]] (Retention of audit and review records) imposes a period of seven years after an accountant concludes an audit or review of an issuer's financial statements, during which the accountant shall retain records relevant to the audit or review, including work-papers and other documents that form the basis of the audit or review, and memoranda, correspondence, communications, other documents, and records (including electronic records).

==General instructions as to financial statements==

General Instructions as to Financial Statements (Rules 3-01 to 3-20)[http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/regS-X/art3.html]

Although referred to as "General Instructions" they are usually quite specific.

All financial statements shall be audited unless otherwise indicated.

Rules 3-01 to 3-20 specify the balance sheets and statements of income and cash flows to be included in disclosure documents when prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X.

Other portions of Regulation S-X govern the examination, form and content of such financial statements, including the basis of consolidation and the schedules to be filed.

*Rule 3-01—Consolidated Balance Sheets [http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/regS-X/SX3-01.html]

Registrants must file audited balance sheets as of the end of each of the two most recent fiscal years for the registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries. Any interim balance sheet provided in accordance with the requirements of this section may be unaudited but shall be at least as current as the most recent balance sheet filed with the Commission on Form 10-Q. Where filings must be made yet year-end balance sheets are not yet available, provision is made for use of interim balance sheets, including time limits on large and accelerated filers.

*Rule 3-02—Consolidated Statements of Income and Changes in Financial Position [http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/regS-X/SX3-02.html]

Registrants must file audited statements of income and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years preceding the date of the most recent audited balance sheet for the registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries and predecessors. In addition, for any interim period between the latest audited balance sheet and the date of the most recent interim balance sheet being filed, interim statements of income and cash flows shall be provided. Such interim financial statements may be unaudited.

*Rule 3-03—Instructions to Income Statement Requirements [http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/regS-X/SX3-03.html]

The instructions note that any unaudited interim financial statements furnished shall reflect all adjustments which are necessary to a fair statement of the results; and a statement to that effect shall be included. Such adjustments shall include, for example, appropriate estimated provisions for bonus and profit sharing arrangements normally determined or settled at year-end. If all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, a statement to that effect shall be made. Otherwise, there shall be furnished information describing in appropriate detail the nature and amount of any adjustments other than normal recurring adjustments.

Also, disclosures regarding [[Market segment|segments]] required by generally accepted accounting principles shall be provided for each year for which an audited statement of income is provided.

==Consolidated and combined financial statements==

Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (Rules 3A-01 to 3A-05)[http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/regS-X/art3A.html]

It is not a law of nature that statements of related or subsidiary entities must be consolidated, however the presumption is that unless there is a good reason not to consolidate, consolidated statements should provide a better picture of overall operations and therefore should be provided.

The degree of ownership of one entity by its parent; foreign subsidiaries; differing fiscal reporting periods - are among the factors management must consider in deciding if or to what extent to consolidate income statements. Rule 3-04 requires that inter-company items and transactions in the consolidated financial statements being filed and unrealized inter-company profits and losses shall be eliminated.

==Rules of general application==

Rules of General Application (Rules 4-01 to 4-10)[http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/regS-X/art4.html]

*Rule 4-01 requires that financial statement be prepared according to US GAAP or 'translated' to US GAAP, with few exceptions.
The Rule also includes "The information required with respect to any statement shall be furnished as a minimum requirement to which shall be added such further material information as is necessary to make the required statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading."  No limit is specified here as to the amount of further information that might be required.

The other Rules here are of little interest with the notable exceptions of Rule 4-08 General Notes to Financial Statements and Rule 4-10 Financial Accounting and Reporting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities. Rule 4-10 must be carefully followed only by oil and gas producers and those who search for raw petroleum sources, but Rule 4-08 is of universal applicability.

*Rule 4-08 requires that the notes to financial statements (modern financial statements 'always' have notes) contain certain information and are presented in a certain way.
:1. Principles of consolidation or combination. 
:2. Assets subject to lien.
:3. Defaults. 
:4. Preferred shares.
:5. Restrictions which limit the payment of dividends by the registrant.
:6. Significant changes in bonds, mortgages and similar debt.
:7. Summarized financial information of subsidiaries not consolidated and 50 percent or less owned persons.
:8. Income tax expense.
:9. Warrants or rights outstanding. 
:10. [Reserved]
:11. Related party transactions which affect the financial statements.
:12. [Reserved.]
:13. Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.
:14. Accounting policies for certain derivative instruments.

For example, #8 (Income Tax Expense) is only four modest paragraphs but must be complied with in the light of [http://www.fasb.org/pdf/fas109.pdf FAS 109 Summary- Accounting for Income Taxes], a 116-page document.

Rule 5 applies to all entities except for those covered by Rule 6, Rule 6A, Rule 7 and Rule 9. Rule 5 'keeps everybody on the same page' by requiring the minimum acceptable disclosure for Balance Sheets and Income Statements.

*Rule 5-02 Balance Sheets [http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/regS-X/SX5-02.html]   "The purpose of this rule is to indicate the various line items and certain additional disclosures which ... should appear on the face of the balance sheets or related notes ..."
*Rule 5-03 Income Statements [http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/regS-X/SX5-03.html]  "The purpose of this rule is to indicate the various line items which ... should appear on the face of the income statements ..."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6104">'''Retransmission consent''' is a provision of the 1992 United States [[Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act]] that requires [[Cable TV|cable]] operators and other [[multichannel video programming distributor]]s (MVPDs) to obtain permission from broadcasters before carrying their programming.

Under the provision, a broadcast station (or its affiliated/parent broadcast network) can ask for monetary payment or other compensation, such as carriage of an additional channel. If the cable operator rejects the broadcaster's proposal, the station can prohibit the cable operator from retransmitting its signal.&lt;ref name="FCC def"&gt;{{cite web|title=Retransmission Consent|url=http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/retransmission-consent|work=FCC Encyclopedia|publisher=U.S. Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=3 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702232636/http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/retransmission-consent|archivedate=2 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) [[Regulation|regulates]] this area of business and public policy pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Part II.&lt;ref&gt;See 47 USC § 531 - § 537 for relevant sections of the Communications Act of 1934, and FCC regulations promulgated pursuant to the Act at 47 CFR 76.56: Signal carriage obligations&lt;/ref&gt;
== History ==
Retransmission consent was adopted in response to the "[[must carry]]" rules that required cable operators to carry all significantly viewed local stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1994-12-05/html/94-29443.htm|title=Federal Register, Volume 59 Issue 232 (Monday, December 5, 1994)|website=www.gpo.gov|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stations could either keep their must carry status, as many smaller, independent stations did, or negotiate with cable operators.

Initially, cable carriers' reaction was to refuse to pay for broadcast programming.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=1963-|first=Crawford, Susan P.,|title=Captive audience : the telecom industry and monopoly power in the new gilded age|url=|page=134|others=|isbn=9781491528747|oclc=897512229}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John C. Malone|John Malone]], head of cable giant [[Tele-Communications Inc.|TeleCommunications Inc]]. refused to pay to carry broadcasters’ content saying, “I don’t intend to pay any money...I will scratch backs."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Instead of monetary payment, some broadcast networks agreed to distribute secondary channels. [[America's Talking]] (now [[MSNBC]]), [[FX (TV channel)|FX]], and [[ESPN2]] all originated through retransmission consent deals in the early 1990s. Many PBS stations received additional local channels. 

=== Legislative History ===
Legislation governing the retransmission of broadcast television content by satellite companies is required to be renewed on a regular basis.  As of 2018, the legislation has been enacted four times. These acts renewed statutory licenses that allow satellite TV companies to retransmit broadcast stations to their customers: &lt;blockquote&gt;1999 - [[Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2004 - [[Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2010 - [[Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010|Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2014 - [[STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014|STELA Reauthorization Act]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Debate==
Retransmission consent has drawn criticism from the cable operators who redistribute programming, and therefore must seek consent from the broadcasters for their program content.  Cable programmers have argued that there is a "shift in leverage toward broadcasters" within the market since introduction of retransmission compensation.&lt;ref&gt;FCC MB Docket No. 17-179, Petition to Deny of American Cable Association [https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10808657201938/MB%20Docket%20No.%2017-179%2C%20Petition%20to%20Deny%20of%20American%20Cable%20Association%20(FINAL).pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcasters typically claim that the programming they provide costs money, and these retransmission fees allow them to provide this expensive programming.  Further, the Cable Act created retransmission consent in order to fix a market imbalance and the marketplace and contract disputes should be addressed in the marketplace.

=== Programming Disruptions ===
Cable operators typically claim during a carriage dispute that the broadcasters are forcing the viewing public to pay for content that is essentially given away for free to those who use an antenna to receive the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://consumerist.com/2017/08/17/dish-solves-pending-channel-blackout-by-giving-its-customers-tv-antennas/index.html|title=Dish Solves Pending Channel Blackout By Giving Its Customers TV Antennas|date=2017-08-17|publisher=Consumerist.com|accessdate=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, broadcasters have argued that the free market approach discourages carriage disputes.  In a 2013 op-ed, former FCC commissioner, [[Robert M. McDowell|Robert McDowell]], argued:&lt;blockquote&gt;TV stations make more money as more people see their shows, thus creating an incentive to distribute their product as widely as possible.  These same market forces also create a disincentive for broadcasters to withhold their signals from distributors like cable and satellite companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/191201-should-the-government-try-to-fix-retransmission-consent|title=Should the government try to ‘fix’ retransmission consent?|last=McDowell|first=Robert|date=2013-11-22|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9366">[[File:Hawaii revenue stamp 50c.jpg|thumb|The $50 value issued in March 1879]]

'''Revenue stamps of Hawaii''' were first issued in late 1876 by the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] to pay taxes according to the Stamp Duty Act of 1876, although [[Impressed duty stamp|embossed revenue stamps]] had been introduced decades earlier in around 1845. The stamps issued in 1876–79 were used for over three decades, remaining in use during the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii|Provisional Government]], the [[Republic of Hawaii|Republic]] and after Hawaii became a [[Territory of Hawaii|U.S. Territory]]. Some changes were made along the years: from rouletted to perforated, and some new values, colours, designs and overprints were added. Some postage stamps were briefly valid for fiscal use in 1886–88 to pay for a tax on [[opium]] imports, and a stamp in a new design was issued for customs duties in 1897. A liquor stamp was issued in 1905.

[[Revenue stamps of the United States]] were introduced in Hawaii in 1900, but the islands continued to issue their own stamps for almost another two decades, until Stamp Duty was repealed in 1917 and the revenue stamps were withdrawn. Since then, the only stamps issued include a taxpaid stamp of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry in the 1930s, egg inspection stamps and conveyance tax meter stamps in the 1960s, and cigarette taxpaid labels which have been used since 2001.

==Kingdom==
Colorless, green or black [[Impressed duty stamp|embossed revenue stamps]] were first used by the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] in around 1845, and various different types remained in use until the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="staterevenue"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hawaii|url=http://staterevenue.org/Documents/HI4_10-10-12.pdf|website=The State Revenue Catalog|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180526123418/http://staterevenue.org/Documents/HI4_10-10-12.pdf|archivedate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Finance (Hawaii)|Ministry of Finance]] of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] issued its first set of revenue stamps on December 22, 1876, when new taxes on deeds, agreements, bills of landing and other documents were introduced following the Stamp Duty Act of 1876. The first stamps to be issued were 25c and 50c values, with a $1 value being added in about March 1877, and $5, $10 and $50 values about March 1879. The stamps had numeral designs, with the dollar values being written as [[Hawaiian dollar|dala]]. The name of the country was expressed as ''HAWAIIAN ISLANDS'', and the issue was rouletted.&lt;ref name="barefoot"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barefoot|first1=John|title=Hawaii|url=http://www.jbarefoot.co.uk/pdfs/Hawaii.pdf|website=J. Barefoot Ltd|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120134831/http://www.jbarefoot.co.uk/pdfs/Hawaii.pdf|archivedate=November 20, 2017|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stamps were printed by the [[American Bank Note Company]] in [[New York City]] and were probably designed by Registrar J. O. Carter.&lt;ref name="hawaiianstamps"&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenue issues|url=http://www.hawaiianstamps.com/revenue.html|website=Post Office in Paradise|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205021858/http://www.hawaiianstamps.com/revenue.html|archivedate=February 5, 2018|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawaii introduced a tax of $1 on the import of each half pound of [[opium]] in 1886. The $1 revenue of 1877 was initially used, but after stocks were running short the 1883 $1 postage stamp depicting [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|Queen Emma]] was used to pay the tax. Pairs of the 50c stamp from the same issue (which depicted King [[Lunalilo]]) might have also been used for this purpose. A number of different cancellations are known on the $1 postage stamp denoting fiscal use: three different types with [[Maltese cross]] designs in black or purple, one with the initials ''J.M.K.'' (John M. Kapena, Collector General of Customs 1886–87) in purple and another with a handstamped script signature of [[Archibald Scott Cleghorn]] (Collector General of Customs 1887–93) in purple. Opium import was banned in 1888 and postage stamps were no longer used for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenue Issues – Fiscal Cancels on Scott No. 49|url=http://www.hawaiianstamps.com/rev_fiscal.html|website=Post Office in Paradise|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227013422/http://hawaiianstamps.com/rev_fiscal.html|archivedate=December 27, 2016|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tax on playing cards was approved by Queen [[Liliʻuokalani]] by an Act of August 4, 1892. A 25c banderole stamp was planned for this purpose, but it was never issued since the tax was repealed by President [[Sanford B. Dole]] on April 24, 1893.&lt;ref name="hawaiianstamps"/&gt;

==Provisional Government==
Days before the [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]], on January 11, 1893, Queen [[Liliʻuokalani]] approved reducing the tax on stock certificates from 25c per $100 to 20c. The new rate became effective on April 1, 1893, at the time when Hawaii was ruled by the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii|Provisional Government]]. New 20c stamps were ordered from the [[San Francisco]] printer H. S. Crocker and Company, but due to an error 25c stamps were printed instead, in a similar design as 1876 Stamp Duty issues but in a new color. The error was recognized immediately and a new order was placed for the required 20c stamps. Both the correct 20c stamps and the error 25c stamps were issued in Hawaii, and it is possible that the 25c stamps were sold for 20c. These stamps exist perforated or imperforate.&lt;ref name="hawaiianstamps"/&gt;

==Republic==
[[File:Revenue stamp Hawaii Kamehameha I ScR11.jpg|thumb|The $1 value issued in 1897, depicting [[Kamehameha I]]]]

During the [[Republic of Hawaii]], the previous issues remained in use, with reprints being made of the $1 stamp of 1876. In 1897, a new $1 value was issued with a new design depicting Hawaii's first king, [[Kamehameha I]]. This stamp was inscribed ''REPUBLIC OF HAWAII INTERNAL REVENUE'', and it was issued to pay Customs duties. It was printed by the American Bank Note Company.&lt;ref name="hawaiianstamps"/&gt;

By April 1898, stocks of the 20c printed in 1893 began to run low, so old stocks of the 25c green of 1876 were [[overprint]]ed with the required value and the text ''REPUBLIC OF HAWAII'' in gold. A number of errors such as double or inverted overprints are known.&lt;ref name="hawaiianstamps"/&gt;

==U.S. Territory==
Hawaii became a [[Territory of Hawaii|U.S. Territory]] in 1898 and the Territorial Government was established in 1900. Taxes by the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] became applicable to the islands, and [[revenue stamps of the United States]] were introduced. However, the Territorial Government could still impose taxes on some documents, and Hawaii revenue stamps remained in use.&lt;ref name="hawaiianstamps"/&gt;

The first stamp issued by the Territory of Hawaii in 1900 was another 20c overprint on the old 25c from 1876. Unlike the 1898 issue, this was in black and only bore the new value. An error exists with the surcharge inverted.&lt;ref name="hawaiianstamps"/&gt;

A $50 stamp was also issued in 1900 in the same design as the first issue but with the inscription reading ''TERRITORY OF HAWAII''. Like the original issue, this was printed by the American Bank Note Company and it was rouletted.&lt;ref name="hawaiianstamps"/&gt; An exempt stamp denoted ''NOT LIABLE TO DUTY'' was issued some time later, and this was perforated instead of rouletted.&lt;ref name="barefoot"/&gt; Little is known about this stamp, and its printer is unknown. It is recorded used from 1910 to 1917.&lt;ref name="hawaiianstamps"/&gt;

A final set of revenue stamps was issued between 1909 and 1913. This had the same designs as the first issue, with identical inscriptions and colours, but were perforated instead of rouletted. It was printed by the American Bank Note Company. Four values were issued: the $5 and $10 in 1909, and the 50c and $1 in 1913. The $5 exists with the centre inverted, and this is Hawaii's rarest revenue.&lt;ref name="barefoot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hawaiianstamps"/&gt;

The stamps were withdrawn when Stamp Duty was repealed in 1917. Remainders available at the time included the 25c of 1876, the $1 of 1897, and the four stamps issued in 1909–13.&lt;ref name="barefoot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hawaiianstamps"/&gt;

An adhesive liquor seal was issued in 1905 by the Office of the Treasurer of the Territory of Hawaii. This was affixed to containers of liquor to be sold by fifth class licences, and it is extremely rare.&lt;ref name="staterevenue"/&gt;

The Department of Agriculture and Forestry issued an undenominated, taxpaid stamp in the 1930s to pay for cultivation permits.&lt;ref name="barefoot"/&gt;

==U.S. State==
A vertical coil tape for Egg Inspection was reportedly issued in 1964. Documentary meter stamps for conveyance tax were introduced in 1967.&lt;ref name="staterevenue"/&gt;

Heat transfer decal taxpaid labels have been used to pay cigarette taxes since 2001.&lt;ref name="staterevenue"/&gt;

The '''right to keep and bear arms''' (often referred to as the '''right to bear arms''') is the people's right to possess [[weapons]] (arms) for their own defense.&lt;ref name=Halbrook1994p8&gt;{{cite book |last=Halbrook |first=Stephen P. |year=1994 |title=That Every Man Be Armed: The Evolution of a Constitutional Right (Independent Studies in Political Economy) |url= |page=8 |publisher=The Independent Institute |location=Oakland, CA |isbn=0-945999-38-0 |oclc=30659789 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only few countries recognize people's right to keep and bear arms and protect it on statutory level, and even fewer protect the right on constitutional level.

In [[Old English]], ''beran'' (past tense ''bær'') means to bear, bring, bring forth, or produce; to endure or sustain; or to wear.&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bear (v.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bear&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bill of Rights 1689]] allowed [[Protestantism|Protestant]] citizens of [[England]] to "have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law" and restricted the ability of the [[English Crown]] to have a [[standing army]] or to interfere with Protestants' right to bear arms "when Papists were both Armed and Imployed contrary to Law" and established that Parliament, not the Crown, could regulate the right to bear arms.&lt;ref name="c21WillMarSess2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/WillandMarSess2/1/2/introduction |title=1688 c.2 1 Will. and Mar.

Sir [[William Blackstone]] wrote in the 18th century that the right to have arms was auxiliary to the "natural right of resistance and self-preservation" subject to suitability and allowance by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp |title=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''arms'' as used in the 1600s, the term refers to the process of equipping for war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas Harper|title=arm (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=arm&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used as a synonym for weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arm|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/arm|website=Thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusion of this right in a written constitution is uncommon. In 1875, 17 percent of constitutions included a right to bear arms. Since the early twentieth century, "the proportion has been less than 9 percent and falling".&lt;ref name=Ginsburg&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Elkins |first2=Zachary |last3=Melton |first3=James |title=U.S. Gun Rights Are Truly American Exceptionalism |work=Bloomberg |date=7 March 2013 |accessdate=25 March 2016 |url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-03-07/u-s-gun-rights-truly-are-american-exceptionalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their historical survey and comparative analysis of constitutions dating back to 1789,&lt;ref name=Ginsburg/&gt; [[Tom Ginsburg]] and colleagues "identified only 15 constitutions (in nine countries) that had ever included an explicit right to bear arms.

Generally, where modern constitutions refer to arms at all, the purpose is "to allow the government to regulate their use or to compel military service, not to provide a right to bear them".&lt;ref name=Ginsburg/&gt; Constitutions which historically guaranteed a right to bear arms are those of [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Liberia]], [[Mexico]], [[Nicaragua]] and the [[United States|United States of America]].&lt;ref name=CCP&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Elkins |first2=Zachary |last3=Melton |first3=James |publisher=CCP: Comparative Constitutions Project |url=http://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/wp-content/uploads/arms-1200w-e1379117382415.png?6c8912 |title=Data Visualizations – Right to Bear Arms |date=2016 |accessdate=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all of the Latin American examples were modelled on that of the United States.&lt;ref name=Elkins/&gt; At present, out of the world’s nearly 200 constitutions, three still include a right to bear arms: Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States; of these three, only the last does not include explicit restrictive conditions.&lt;ref name=Ginsburg/&gt;

Mexican constitution of 1857 first included right to be armed. In its first version, the right was defined in similar terms as it is in the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. A new Mexican constitution of 1917 relativized the right, stating that its utilization must be in line with local police regulations.

Another change was included in 1971 Constitution. Since then, Mexicans have the right to be armed only within their home and further utilization of this right is subject to [[Gun politics in Mexico|statutory authorization in Federal law]].

==Gun violence and the politics of the right to bear arms==
{{Weasel|section|date=September 2018}}
Legal restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms are usually put in place by legislators because they believe that they will reduce gun related violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/International/Story?id=3066193&amp;page=1 |title=U.K. Response to School Massacre: Ban Handguns |first=David |last=Wright |date=April 22, 2007 |work=ABC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/29/europe/union.php |title=EU legislators push tougher gun controls |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=November 29, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/29/world/europe/29iht-union.4.8532843.html |archivedate=November 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/01/us/clinton-calls-brady-law-a-success-and-backs-more-limits.html |title=President Clinton Calls Brady Law a Success and Backs More Limits |work=[[New York Times]] |date=December 1, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their actions are frequently the result of grass roots pressure for such controls. The [[Brady Campaign|Brady]], [[Snowdrop Campaign]]s, and the [[Million Mom March]] are recent examples of campaigns calling for tighter restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms.

Accident statistics are hard to obtain, but much data is available on the issue of gun ownership and gun related deaths. The United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) has made comparisons between countries with different levels of gun ownership and investigated the correlation between gun ownership levels and gun homicides, and between gun ownership levels and gun suicides. A strong correlation is seen in both.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
During the 1989 and 1992 International Crime Surveys, data on gun ownership in eighteen countries have been collected on which WHO data on suicide and homicide committed with guns and other means are also available. The results presented in a previous paper based on the fourteen countries surveyed during the first ICS and on rank correlations (Spearman's rho), suggested that gun ownership may increase suicides and homicides using firearms, while it may not reduce suicides and homicides with other means. In the present analysis, four additional countries covered by the 1992 ICS only have been included, and Pearson's correlation coefficients r have been used. The results confirm those presented in the previous study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Killias |first=Martin |year=1993 |chapter=Gun Ownership, Suicide and Homicide: An International Perspective |editor1-first=Anna |editor1-last=Alvazzi del Frate |editor2-first=Ugljesa |editor2-last=Zvekic |editor3-first=Jan J. M. |editor3-last=van Dijk |title=Understanding Crime, Experiences of Crime and Crime Control - Acts of the International Conference, Rome, 18–20 Nov 1992 |pages=289–306 |location=Rome |publisher=United Nations International Crime &amp; Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) |isbn=92-9078-023-1 |chapterurl=http://www.unicri.it/wwk/publications/books/series/understanding/19_GUN_OWNERSHIP.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107174528/http://www.unicri.it/wwk/publications/books/series/understanding/19_GUN_OWNERSHIP.pdf |archivedate=2008-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

UNICRI also investigated the relationship between gun ownership levels and other forms of homicide or suicide to determine whether high gun ownership added to or merely displaced other forms of homicide or suicide. They reported that "widespread gun ownership has not been found to reduce the likelihood of fatal events committed with other means. Thus, people do not turn to knives and other potentially lethal instruments less often when more guns are available, but more guns usually means more victims of suicide and homicide." Speculating on possible causes the researchers concluded that "all we know is that guns do not reduce fatal events due to other means, but that they go along with more shootings. Although we do not know why exactly this is so, we have a good reason to suspect guns to play a—fatal—role in this".&lt;ref name="UNICRI"&gt;{{cite book |last=Killias |first=Martin |year=1993 |chapter=Gun Ownership, Suicide and Homicide: An International Perspective |editor1-first=Anna |editor1-last=Alvazzi del Frate |editor2-first=Ugljesa |editor2-last=Zvekic |editor3-first=Jan J.

The research reporter found that guns were the major cause of homicides in 3 of the 14 countries it studied; Northern Ireland, Italy, and the United States. Although the data seem to indicate that reducing the availability of one significant type of arms—firearms—leads to reductions both in gun crimes and gun suicides and in overall crimes and overall suicides, the author did caution that "reducing the number of guns in the hands of the private citizen may become a hopeless task beyond a certain point", citing the American example.&lt;ref name="UNICRI"/&gt;

In contrast to the 1993 study however, a more recent study by UNICRI researchers from 2001 examined the link between household gun ownership and overall homicide, overall suicide, as well as gun homicide and gun suicide rates amongst 21 countries. Significant correlations between household gun ownership and rates of gun suicides for both genders, and gun homicide rates involving female victims were found. There were no significant correlations detected for total homicide and suicide rates, as well as gun homicide rates involving male victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Killias |first=M. |last2=van Kesteren |first2=J. |last3=Rindlisbacher |first3=M. |year=2001 |title=Guns, Violent Crime, and Suicide in 21 Countries |journal=[[Canadian Journal of Criminology]] |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=429–448 |url=https://pure.uvt.nl/portal/files/5263789/GunsKilliasvKesteren.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Left Review 53, September-October 2008.|website=newleftreview.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first inception of the concept, Lefevbre paid specific emphasis on the effects that capitalism had over “the city”, whereas urban life was downgraded into a commodity, social interaction became increasingly uprooted and urban space and governance were turned into exclusive goods.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://capitanswing.com/libros/el-derecho-a-la-ciudad/|title=El derecho a la ciudad  {{!}}  Capitán Swing|last=Swing|first=Capitán|website=capitanswing.com|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to this trend, Lefevbre called to “''rescue the citizen as main element and protagonist of the city that he himself had built''” and to transform urban space into “''a meeting point for building collective life''”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to the inequalities produced by the rapid increase of world urban population in most regions of the world, the concept of the right to the city has been recalled on several occasions since the publication of Lefevbre’s book as a call to action by social movements and grassroots organizations. In their appeal for “their right to the city”, local mobilizations around the world usually refer to their struggle for social justice and a dignified access to urban life face to growing urban inequalities (especially in large metropolitan concepts). The right to the city has had a particular influence in [[Latin America]] and [[Europe]], where social movements have particularly appealed to the concept in their actions and promoted local instruments for advancing its concrete understanding in terms of policy-making at the local and even national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/observatory/reports/competitive-metropolises-and-prospects-spatial-justice|title=Competitive Metropolises and the Prospects for Spatial Justice {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rioonwatch.org/?p=11668|title=What Is The Right to the City? {{!}} RioOnWatch|website=www.rioonwatch.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good proof on how the notion of right to the city has gained international recognition in the last years could be seen in the [[United Nations]] [[Habitat III]] process, and how the [[New Urban Agenda]] (2016) recognized the concept as the vision of “cities for all”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/20/habitat-3-right-city-concrete-policies-ada-colau|title=After Habitat III: a stronger urban future must be based on the right to the city|last=Colau|first=Ada|date=2016-10-20|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing popularity of the concept has nonetheless raised some criticism and concerns on how the original vision of Henri Lefevbre could be reduced to a “citizenship vision”, focused on the mere implementation of social and economic rights in the city leaving aside its transformatory nature and the concept of social conflict behind the original concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/03/16/seres_urbanos/1521194122_492095.html|title=Elogio y rescate de Henri Lefebvre|last=Delgado|first=Manuel|date=2018-03-19|work=El País|access-date=2018-06-14|language=es|issn=1134-6582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Gorgens | first1 = Tristan | last2 = van Donk | first2 = Mirjam | title = From basic needs towards socio-spatial transformation: coming to grips with the 'Right to the City' for the urban poor in South Africa | url = http://isandla.org.za/publications/152/ | website = isandla.org.za | publisher = The Isandla Institute | date = 2011 }} [http://isandla.org.za/download/assets/gorgens_and_van_donk_isandla_institute_acc-cubes_conference_paper.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcelo Lopes de Souza]] has for instance argued that as the right to the city has become "''fashionable these days''", "''the price of this has often been the trivialisation and corruption of Lefebvre's concept''"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lopes de Souza | first = Marcelo | title = Which right to which city?

The objective of security sector reform (SSR) is to achieve good security sector governance (SSG)—where security actors are effective and accountable to their people. For example, SSR might guide decision-making on what form should the oversight of armed forces take or how transparent will intelligence agencies be according to legislation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2151(2014)|title=UN Security Council Resolution 2151 (S/RES/2151) on Security sector reform: challenges and opportunities|last=|first=|publisher=United Nations|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121073122/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S%2FRES%2F2151%282014%29|archivedate=2017-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different nomenclature of the same overall framework include '''security system reform''' ('''SSR'''), '''security sector reconstruction''' ('''SSR''') and '''justice and security sector reform''' ('''JSSR''').&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dcaf.ch/sites/default/files/publications/documents/DCAF_BG_2_Security%20Sector%20Reform.pdf|title=Security Sector Reform: Applying the principles of good governance to the security sector|last=|first=|publisher=DCAF|year=2015|isbn=|series=SSR Backgrounder Series|location=Geneva|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913183845/http://www.dcaf.ch/sites/default/files/publications/documents/DCAF_BG_2_Security%20Sector%20Reform.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1994, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) adopted a Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security stating that the democratic control of the security sector as essential to stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.osce.org/fsc/41355?download=true|title=Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security|last=|first=|publisher=OSCE|year=1994|isbn=|location=Vienna|pages=3|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829145812/http://www.osce.org/fsc/41355?download=true|archivedate=2017-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A framework for security sector reform (SSR) emerged in 1999 after [[international development]] actors observed from examples in [[South Africa]], [[Indonesia]] and countries in Eastern Europe that national security and its components were considered crucial in a state recovering from [[War|conflict]] or an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian regime]]. Reportedly, the increasing number of [[Civil war|civil wars]] led development actors to look at the problem of insecurity from the perspective of good governance. The conclusion was that the security sector should adhere to the same rules of good governance as any other public service to curb conflict and violence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clingendael.nl/publication/ssr-securing-its-success-justifying-its-relevance|title=SSR: Securing its success, justifying its relevance|last=Price|first=Megan|date=2014-08-19|work=Clingendael|access-date=|last2=van Veen|first2=Erwin|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234737/https://www.clingendael.nl/publication/ssr-securing-its-success-justifying-its-relevance|archivedate=2017-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[United Nations Security Council]] (UNSC) adopted its first stand-alone resolution on SSR and within it the role of security sector reform in stabilizing post-conflict countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sc11369.doc.htm|title=Unanimously Adopting Resolution 2151 (2014), Security Council Underscores Need for National Ownership of Security-Sector Reform|last=|first=|date=2014-04-28|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820151018/http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sc11369.doc.htm|archivedate=2017-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/articles/2015/02/13/undp-sees-security-sector-reform-as-foundation-for-peace-and-development-.html|title=UNDP sees Security Sector Reform as foundation for Peace and Development|last=|first=|date=2015-02-13|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826000511/http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/articles/2015/02/13/undp-sees-security-sector-reform-as-foundation-for-peace-and-development-.html|archivedate=2017-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Female police officer of Denmark.jpg|thumb|The [[Service quality|quality of the service]] provided by the police, such as the pictured [[Police of Denmark]], is a component of security sector governance and reform]]There is no single globally accepted definition of security sector reform (SSR), but it generally refers to a process to reform or rebuild a state's [[National security|security sector]] towards good security sector governance (SSG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/sites/devco/files/joint-communication-ssr-20160705-p1-854572_en.pdf|title=Elements for an EU-wide strategic framework to support security sector reform, JOIN(2016) 31 final|last=|first=|publisher=European Commission|year=2016|isbn=|location=Strasbourg|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825234526/https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/sites/devco/files/joint-communication-ssr-20160705-p1-854572_en.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/115810.pdf|title=Security Sector Reform|last=|first=|publisher=USAID, US Departments of Defense and State|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107024030/https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/115810.pdf|archivedate=2017-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good SSG is usually defined as a number of idealized principles and good practices of a healthy security sector servicing its people. Likewise, the objective of SSR is defined as the application of the same principles of [[good governance]] to the security sector as to any other public sector service delivery, such as [[public health]] or [[education]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dcaf.ch/about-ssgr|title=About SSG/R|last=|first=|date=|website=DCAF (Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces)|language=en|access-date=2017-11-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107012716/http://dcaf.ch/about-ssgr|archivedate=2017-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) of the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (]]OECD) has defined four standards that SSR should strive for:&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Establishment of effective governance, oversight and accountability in the security system; 2) improved delivery of security and justice services; 3) development of local leadership and ownership of the reform process; and 4) sustainability of justice and security service delivery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The target of SSR are the components of the state that uphold [[national security]]. Although the security sector is therefore a wide term open to interpretation, it is generally used to describe the structures, institutions and personnel responsible for the management, provision and oversight of security in a certain country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/publications/ssr/ssr_perspective_2012.pdf|title=The United Nations SSR Perspective|last=|first=|publisher=UN SSR Unit|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519215426/http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/publications/ssr/ssr_perspective_2012.pdf|archivedate=2017-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the scope and target of SSR has usually been defined comprising the following four groups:
* Core security actors, such as armed forces, police, gendarmerie, border guards, customs and immigration, and intelligence and security services;
* security management and oversight bodies, such as ministries of defence and internal affairs, financial management bodies and public complaints commissions;
* justice and law enforcement institutions, such as the judiciary, prisons, prosecution services, traditional justice systems; and
* non-statutory security forces, such as private security companies, guerrilla armies and private militia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/deza/en/documents/themen/fragile-kontexte/224402-oecd-handbook-security-system-reform_EN.pdf|title=The OECD DAC Handbook on Security System Reform (SSR) - Supporting Security and Justice|last=|first=|publisher=OECD DAC|year=2007|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821172956/https://www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/deza/en/documents/themen/fragile-kontexte/224402-oecd-handbook-security-system-reform_EN.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/%28httpAssets%29/904B9EE812B7591FC12573F400322816/$file/Joint+Seminar_A-62-659_S-2008-39.pdf|title=Securing peace and development: the role of the United Nations in supporting security sector reform - Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/659)|last=|first=|publisher=United Nations|year=2008|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905032133/http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/(httpAssets)/904B9EE812B7591FC12573F400322816/$file/Joint+Seminar_A-62-659_S-2008-39.pdf|archivedate=2014-09-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fba.se/en/how-we-work/security-sector-reform/|title=Security Sector Reform|last=|first=|date=|work=Folke Bernadotte Academy|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826130304/https://fba.se/en/how-we-work/security-sector-reform/|archivedate=2016-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objective ==
[[File:SSG and SSR.png|thumb|A diagram of the relationship between security sector reform and governance relative to time and quality|left]]To observe and measure the quality of SSG as well as set more definite objectives, [[international development]] actors generally break down good security sector governance into different principless that are believed to showcase different subparts of a healthy security sector under democratic control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/resources/what-good-governance|title=What is Good Governance?|last=|first=|date=2009-06-10|website=United Nations ESCAP|language=en|access-date=2017-04-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423153306/http://www.unescap.org/resources/what-good-governance|archivedate=2017-04-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While exact configurations vary, some of the most common principles or objectives of good SSG that are commonly used include [[accountability]], [[rule of law]], and [[effectiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.osce.org/secretariat/231176|title=Security Sector Governance and Reform: Guidelines for OSCE Staff|last=|first=|publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)|year=2016|isbn=|location=Vienna|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825185357/http://www.osce.org/secretariat/231176|archivedate=2017-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Thomas G.|date=2000-10-01|title=Governance, good governance and global governance: Conceptual and actual challenges|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713701075|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=21|issue=5|pages=795–814|doi=10.1080/713701075|issn=0143-6597}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A multitude of different practical situations of good SSG exist according to development actors: For example, in a security sector lead by good governance, the [[use of force]] is defined by a legal framework. This subsequently requires, among others, that publicly transparent [[law]]s are in place; oversight and [[separation of powers]] mechanisms are established and working; and the state's [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] use of force is regulated through strategies and policies.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An operational level example would be improved and open interaction between the public and the security sector, including functioning [[freedom of information]] and [[complaint]] institutes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

SSR is aimed at the existence of both national security and [[human security]]. However, the goals of providing national and human security can be conflictual in the context of conflict-torn societies which lack the framework of democratic governance. According to Florian Weigand, the experiences of SSR in [[Afghanistan]], for example, have prompted a debate on the advantages of providing human rather than state security in the process of state-building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/internationalDevelopment/pdf/WP/WP135.pdf|title=How can security sector reforms contribute to State-Building?

SSR is not understood by researchers to be limited to a single political situation, but rather can be introduced in various contexts. The circumstances under which reform efforts are undertaken are often classified as three different reform environments: post-conflict, [[Provisional government|transitional]] and [[Developed country|developed countries]]. Nevertheless, security sector reform is most commonly introduced in post-conflict settings after [[war]] has ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dcaf.ch/security-governance-post-conflict-peacebuilding|title=Security Governance in Post-Conflict Peacebuilding|last=Bryden|first=Alan|last2=Hänggi|first2=Heiner|publisher=Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)|year=2005|isbn=978-3-8258-9019-3|location=Geneva|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915024200/http://www.dcaf.ch/security-governance-post-conflict-peacebuilding|archivedate=2017-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its insensitive application to such contexts has raised criticism. For example, Jane Chanaa has argued that there is a concept–context divide because conceptualisation overshadowed the understanding on how the idea adapts to the local situations whereas Safal Ghimire has noted that such a chasm exists also because the 'SSR' concept does not talk about reforms in the benefactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chanaa, Jane.

{{Companies law}}
A '''sole proprietorship''', also known as the '''sole trader''', '''individual entrepreneurship''' or '''proprietorship''', is a type of enterprise that is owned and run by one person and in which there is no legal distinction between the owner and the [[Types of business entity|business entity]]. The owner is in direct control of all elements and is legally accountable for the finances of such business and this may include debts, loans, loss, etc. A sole trader does not necessarily work 'alone'—it is possible for the sole trader to employ other people.&lt;ref&gt;The Accountancy Partnership, [https://www.theaccountancy.co.uk/articles/information/can-a-sole-trader-have-employees-639.html Can a sole trader have employees?] published 10 March 2012, accessed 22 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The sole trader receives all profits (subject to taxation specific to the business) and has unlimited responsibility for all losses and debts. Every asset of the business is owned by the proprietor and all debts of the business are the proprietor's. It is a "sole" proprietorship in contrast with [[partnership]]s (which have at least two owners).

A sole proprietor may use a [[trade name]] or business name other than their or its legal name. They may have to legally trademark their business name if it differs from their own legal name, the process varying depending upon country of residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.smallbusiness.wa.gov.au/step-3-how-do-i-register-my-business-name/|title = Small Business.gov.au - How do I register my business name?|date = |accessdate = 2015-07-13|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140820064531/http://www.smallbusiness.wa.gov.au/step-3-how-do-i-register-my-business-name/|archive-date = 2014-10-18|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Registration of a business name for a sole proprietor is generally uncomplicated unless it involves the selection of a name that is fictitious, or “assumed”. The business owner is required to register with the appropriate [[local authorities]], who will determine that the name submitted is not duplicated by another [[business entity]]. Furthermore, the business owner must complete a form submitted to the governing authority to acquire title as a “DBA” or "[[doing business as]]”. The authority in some US states is the Secretary of State.

The license for a sole proprietary business entitles the owner to hire [[Employment|employees]] and enlist the services of [[Independent contractor|independent consultants]]. Although an employee or consultant may be requested by the owner to complete a specific project or participate in the company's [[decision-making]] process, their contribution to the project or decision is considered a ''recommendation'' under the law. Under the [[legal doctrine]] ''Respondeat superior'' ([[Latin]]: "let the master answer"), the [[legal liability]] for any business decision arising from such a contribution remains upon the owner and cannot be renounced or [[Apportionment|apportioned]].

This is transposed by the unlimited liability attached to a sole proprietary business. The owner carries the financial responsibility for all [[debts]] and/or losses suffered by the business, to the extent of using personal or other assets, to discharge any outstanding [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]]. The owner is exclusively liable for all business activities conducted by the sole proprietorship and accordingly, entitled to full control and all earnings associated with it. The general aspect according to the general business law is that this type of business owner does not embody a “[[legal entity]]” Furthermore, any attempted and unreliable distinctions of the business do not change the classification under this title.

==Rules for sole proprietorships in different countries==

===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], a sole trader who wishes to use a business name must register that name with the [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|Companies Registration Office]] (CRO).&lt;ref&gt;Citizens Information Board, [http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/types_of_employment/self_employment/setting_up_a_business_in_ireland.html Starting a Business], published 21 March 2018, accessed 22 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malaysia ===
==== Registration of Sole Proprietorships ====
In [[Malaysia]], there are three different laws governing the registration and administration of sole proprietors:-
# West Malaysia and the Federal Territory of [[Labuan]]: Registration of Business Act 1956 (Act 197);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ssm.com.my/sites/default/files/acts/fscommand/a0197.htm|title=Registration of Business Act 1956|last=|first=|date=|website=Companies Commission of Malaysia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Sabah]]: Trades Licensing Ordinance for the State of Sabah [Sabah Chapter 144].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawnet.sabah.gov.my/Lawnet/SabahLawsDeclaredFederal/TradesLicensingOrdinance(SabahCap144).pdf|title=Trades Licensing Ordinance [Sabah Chapter 144]|last=|first=|date=|website=Sabah State Attorney-General's Chambers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In West Malaysia, the registration of sole proprietors come under the purview of the [[Companies Commission of Malaysia]] (''Suruhanjaya Syarikat Malaysia'', or abbreviated as ''SSM''). In Sabah and Sarawak (with the exception of Kuching), the registration of businesses are done at the local authorities (e.g. municipal councils or district offices) while in [[Kuching]], sole proprietors are registered with the Kuching Office of the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board.

Sole proprietors, which includes the self-employed, must register with the relevant authority within thirty (30) days from the commencement of their business&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssm.com.my/sites/default/files/guidelines/OWNER%20RESPONSIBILITY_new.pdf|title=Responsibility of Business Owner|last=|first=|date=|website=Companies Commission of Malaysia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Sole proprietors may register their business using one of two names: (1) their legal name following the registrant's identity card or (2) a trade name&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ssm.com.my/en/sole/starting-a-sole-proprietorship-partnership|title=Starting a Sole Proprietorship/Partnership|last=|first=|date=|website=Companies Commission of Malaysia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Registration of a business lasts either one or two years, and must be renewed thirty (30) days before its expiry&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

In the event of termination of business, the proprietor has thirty (30) days from the termination date to file the notice with the relevant authority&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. If the termination is caused by the death of the proprietor, the administrators of the estate has four (4) months from the death date to file a notice of termination&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==== Goods and Services Tax (GST) ====
Sole proprietors must register with the Royal Malaysian Customs Department to charge and collect goods and services tax (GST) once their taxable turnover within a 12 month-period exceeds RM500,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gst.customs.gov.my/en/SiteAssets/doc/Registering%20for%20GST%20Amend%201.pdf|title=Getting Ready for GST – Registering for GST|last=|first=|date=|website=Royal Malaysian Customs Department|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Sole Proprietors as Employers ====
Similar to other Common Law jurisdiction, proprietors may enter into contracts of employment and/or apprenticeship with their employees. Sole proprietors, as employers, are responsible to:-
* Make contribution to their employees' Employees Provident Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kwsp.gov.my/portal/en/employers|title=EPF - Employers - KWSP|website=www.kwsp.gov.my|language=ms-MY|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and
* Pay contribution to their employees' Social Security&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.perkeso.gov.my/index.php/en/social-security-protection/employer-employee-eligibility|title=Employer &amp; Employee Eligibility|last=User|first=Super|website=www.perkeso.gov.my|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Online Businesses ====
In 2016, the SSM took legal action against 478 online businesses who fail to register their businesses whether as sole proprietors, partnerships, or private limited companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/01/26/ssm-unregistered-businesses-cannot-sell-products-online/|title=SSM: Unregistered businesses cannot sell products online - Nation {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As at May 12 2017, a total of 50,882 online businesses have registered with the SSM since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astroawani.com/berita-bisnes/50-882-peniaga-online-berdaftar-dengan-ssm-143421|title=50882 peniaga online berdaftar dengan SSM|website=www.astroawani.com|language=ms|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom ===
A sole trader is the simplest type of business structure defined in UK law. It refers to an individual who owns their own business and retains all the profits from it. When starting up, sole traders must complete a straightforward registration with [[HM Revenue and Customs]] as self-employed for tax and National Insurance purposes.&lt;ref&gt;HMRC, [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/selfemployed/register-selfemp.htm First Steps To Register As Self-Employed]&lt;/ref&gt; They are responsible for maintaining the businesses records and submitting an annual Tax return for all income from self-employment and other work.&lt;ref&gt;Business Link, [http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1073789606&amp;type=RESOURCES  Legal Structures: The Basics - Sole Trader]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, anyone who begins work for themselves is considered by the Government to be a self-employed sole trader, regardless of whether or not they have advised [[HM Revenue and Customs]]. A sole trader can keep all the profits of their business after tax has been paid. They must lodge a self-assessment tax return each year, and pay Income Tax as well as [[National Insurance]]. If revenue is expected to be more than £83,000 a year, they must also register for the [[Value Added Tax (United Kingdom)|Value Added Tax]]. A sole trader can employ staff, but is personally responsible for any losses the business makes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures/sole-trader|title = Choose a legal structure for your business|date = 1 April 2015|accessdate = 7 July 2015|website = GOV.UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Advantages ====
Becoming a sole trader is relatively simple compared to other business structures. It can rapidly enable a business to begin trading; the requirements for record keeping are far more straightforward than other business structures. Sole traders make all operational decisions and are solely responsible for raising business finance. They can invest their own capital into the business, or may be able to access business loans and/or overdrafts. Unlike limited companies or partnerships, it is not necessary to share decision making or the profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Set up as a sole trader|url=https://www.gov.uk/set-up-sole-trader|website=gov.uk|publisher=Crown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Disadvantages ====
The simplicity of this structure also has its limitations. Unlike forming a limited company, it lacks the clear cut definition between personal and business income from the perspective of the tax authorities.{{Fact|date=July 2012}} The business owner is personally liable for income tax and National Insurance contributions due for the business profits in each given tax year. They are also personally liable for any debts the business incurs. Business analysts may advise sole traders to form a limited company in order to access greater levels of financing, for example for expansion plans. This can limit their personal liability; business lenders may be more inclined to co-operate with a limited company. It can also be the case that within certain industries it is easier to secure work if presenting potential business partners with a [[Limited company|limited company structure]].

===United States===
In the United States there are no formalities that must be followed to start a sole proprietorship or commence business as a sole proprietor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=The Sole Proprietorship|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/sole_proprietorship.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, depending upon the business activity of the sole proprietorship, sole proprietors may require licenses and permits in order to conduct business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Christopher|title=What Are the Registration Requirements &amp; Procedures for Sole Proprietorship?|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/registration-requirements-procedures-sole-proprietorship-3953.html|website=Chron|publisher=Texas Chronicle|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Small Business Administration]] (SBA) a sole proprietor and their business are considered as one and the same; therefore, the business is not subjected to separate taxation and regarded as the direct income of the owner. Income, losses and expenses may be listed on a Schedule C, which is then transferred to the personal tax return of the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sole Proprietorships|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/sole-proprietorships|website=IRS|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the responsibility of the owner to ensure all due income taxes and self-employment contributions are paid.

A permitted exception to the sole proprietor (single owner) stipulation is made by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) permitting the spouse of a sole proprietor to work for the business. They are not classified as partners in the enterprise, or an [[independent contractor]], enabling the business to retain its sole proprietorship status and not be required to submit a partnership income tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Husband and Wife Business|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/husband-and-wife-business|website=Internal Revenue Service|publisher=irs.gov|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foundation and development====
The setting-up process of a sole proprietorship to comply with local laws and regulations, is obtainable from the Small Business Development Center (SBDC), using their locator facility. A sole proprietor must be prepared to devote their time, utilizing business methods towards establishing a sound and appropriate foundation. Doing so may contribute to increased turnover, profits, minimize taxes, and avoid other potential adversities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weltman|first1=Barbara|title=J.K. Lasser's Small Business Taxes 2011: Your Complete Guide to a Better|date=2011|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0470939575|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7ruyHGt6BYC|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sole owners are engaged in many varieties of industry and commerce and a comprehensive list of the primary categories, is found in the [[North American Industry Classification System]] (NAICS). The selection of a business type by a new sole proprietor is in many instances, motivated by appropriate business experience in a particular field, especially those pertaining to enterprises involving the marketing and selling of defined products and services.

A crucial component of a sole proprietorship within a business plan is the provision of an inherent guideline, for actions that require implementing for a business to achieve growth. The business name and products are critical aspects in the founding of a sole proprietorship and once selected, should be protected. In the event of a determined brand name being legalized, information regarding trademark protection is available from the U.S. Patent and [[Trademark]] Office.

====Finances====
For the sole proprietor there are a variety of options in obtaining financial support for their business, including loan facilities available from the U.S. [[Small Business Administration]]. The loans are not originated by the SBA, but the administration does guarantee loans made by various independent lending institutions. The primary loan facility for small businesses offered by this agency is the 7(a) loan program, designed for general applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 7(a) Loan Program|url = https://www.sba.gov/7a-loan-program|website = SBA.gov|accessdate = 11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sole proprietors are able to finance legitimate operating expenses; for example, working capital, furniture, leasehold improvements and building renovations.

Many and varied private [[organizations]] and individuals seek opportunities to invest and fund a business that may not qualify for [[Small business financing|traditional financing]] from institutions, such as banks. For the sole proprietor, seeking to take advantage of this facility, there are various factors that must be understood and adhered to regarding the [[loan application]].

The [[Small Business Administration]] (SBA) advises there are traditionally two forms of financing: [[debt]] and [[Equity (finance)|equity]]. For any [[small business owner]] seeking funding, they must consider the [[debt-to-equity ratio]] of their enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The SBA Loan Guarantee Program|url=https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/SDOLoanFactSheet_Oct_2011.pdf|website=Small Business Administration|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means the inter-action between the sum of dollars borrowed and the financial dollars invested in the business. The mathematics are simple; greater the finance invested by sole proprietors in their business; easier the obtaining of finance! The SBA statistics show that the majority of [[small enterprises]] favor the use of limited equity financing; for example, friends and relatives.

According to the SBA, there are various private organizations prepared to fund sole proprietor [[business operations]] that do not qualify for traditional financing from banks. These [[private investors]] can provide loans, credit lines, leasing facilities for equipment, or other forms of capital, to sole proprietorship that have exhausted alternative financial resources. It is also possible for these owners to obtain financing by way of [[business partners]] or others, with cash to invest. Financial partners are frequently “silent” and although they do not participate in any business related decisions, they generally receive a percentage of the profits, generated by the business.

To assist sole proprietors, there are business grants available from the Federal Government or private organizations, providing certain criteria are met. To qualify for Federal grants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Sole Proprietorship Loan Programs|url = http://www.sba.gov/category/navigation-structure/loans-grants/small-business-loans/sba-loan-programs|website = SBA.gov|accessdate = 11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; small businesses must comply with determined business size and income standards. For consideration regarding various grant opportunities, sole proprietors may apply for a grant in their capacity as an individual. [[Local governments]] and state economic development agencies, frequently make [[grants]] available, for businesses that stimulate their [[local economies]].

For any sole proprietor applying for a loan, before starting the loan procedure, it is essential their personal and business credit history is in order and up-to-date. A personal credit report should be obtained from a credit bureau; for example, Trans-Union, [[Equifax]] or [[Experian]]. This action should be initiated by a business owner well before starting the borrowing process.

The [[Small Business Administration]] specifies that all credit reports received from any source should be carefully reviewed to ensure that all relevant [[personal information]] is correct. Other content in the report should also be examined particularly that related to the past credit obtained, from sources such as, credit cards, [[mortgages]], student loans, as well as details pertaining to how the credit was repaid.

An exact translation of "sole proprietorship" is unusual, because the focus of the concept can change. An example is the Brazilian concept of "sole business" that was split into two main kinds of [[Freelancer|formal freelancer]]:
*'''sole professional''': with [[Academic certificate#Higher level academic certificates|higher level academic certificate]] and regulations for formal control of autonomous exercise (ex. sole doctor's office).
*'''sole entrepreneur''': typical "little entrepreneurs", as sole craftsman, autonomous taxi driver, and many others, that can be formal. An [[Informal sector|informal]] freelancer, through a simple process, can be formalized as ''sole microentrepreneur'' 

[[German tax system|German]] and [[Law of Austria|Austrian]] tax laws also differentiate between sole professionals and other sole proprietors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5268">'''Space jurisdiction''', a field addressing what countries can enforce various [[law]]s in [[outer space|space]], has become more important as the private sector enters the field of [[space tourism]]. Under the [[Outer Space Treaty]] of 1967, while space and celestial bodies cannot be appropriated by nations, objects launched into space and personnel on board them remain under the jurisdiction of the state of registry.

== International treaties ==
The majority of international treaties currently in existence address only specific aspects of space.  No major treaties have been passed that have broad, sweeping jurisdiction in space, and it is largely unclear who would enforce such laws.  The treaties currently in existence regarding [[space law]] include the following:

*The [[Outer Space Treaty]] of 1967
*The [[Rescue Agreement]] of 1968.
*The [[Space Liability Convention]] of 1972.
*The [[Registration Convention]] of 1976.

The [[Moon Treaty]] of 1979 was proposed after the Outer Space Treaty, but failed to be ratified by any major [[Space-faring nations|space-faring nation]] such as those capable of [[Timeline of first orbital launches by country|orbital spaceflight]].&lt;ref name='UNOOSA'&gt;[http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/publications/ST_SPACE_11_Rev2_Add1E.pdf Status of international agreements relating to activities in outer space as at 1 January 2008] United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;.  If it had been broadly accepted, the result would have been an international regime overseeing extraction of resources from celestial bodies.
 
== Trade in space ==
Issues of trade and crime in space have not been debated except with respect to the [[International Space Station]].  Agreements have involved all units in operation including Europe, the United States, Russia, Canada, and Japan.  Three basic levels of agreement include:

*[[International Space Station]] [[Intergovernmental Agreement]], an [[international treaty]] signed on Jan. 29, 1998 by the fifteen governments involved in the Space Station project. This governmental-level document provides for teamwork between the involved countries in a peaceful [[Space Station]].
*Four [[Memorandum of Understanding|Memoranda of Understanding]], an agreement between the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] and each co-operating Space Agency: [[European Space Agency]], [[Canadian Space Agency]], [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] ([[Roscosmos]]), and [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]].  The objective of these space agencies-level agreements is to specify the roles and responsibilities of each agency in the design, development, operation and utilization of the Space Station.

== Space marriage ==
Space marriage is a relatively unexplored but emerging attraction of [[space tourism]] industry in the private sector.  As more private companies start to travel into space, the demand for such services as marriage in space may increase.

On August 10, 2003, Russian cosmonaut [[Yuri Malenchenko]] became the first human to marry in space.  A provision in [[Texas]] [[marriage]] laws, that says one party does not have to be present so long as the couple presents an [[affidavit]] explaining why one of the two participants in the ceremony can't attend, allowed Malenchenko to marry his bride, [[Ekaterina Dmitriev]], from the [[International Space Station]].

==Other matters of space jurisdiction==
With the failure of the Moon Treaty of 1979 (which would have established a principle of the [[common heritage of mankind]] for celestial bodies and required establishing an international regime to supervise use), there is no clear rule regarding the development or use of resources located in space, whether by states or private parties.  The United States has asserted a right for U.S. citizens to own space resources they obtain, per the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (H.R. 2262) § 51303:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planetaryresources.com/2015/11/president-obama-signs-bill-recognizing-asteroid-resource-property-rights-into-law/&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text=
A United States citizen engaged in commercial recovery of an asteroid resource or a space resource under this chapter shall be entitled to any asteroid resource or space resource obtained, including to possess, own, transport, use, and sell the asteroid resource or space resource obtained in accordance with applicable law, including the international obligations of the United States}}

Crimes committed in space, under current law, currently would seem to fall to the same mix of claims of jurisdiction by state of registry, nationality of the perpetrator, and nationality of the victim that govern crimes on the [[high seas]] or in [[Antarctica]].

The '''spider in the web''' doctrine is a [[legal doctrine]] in [[Patent law of the Netherlands|Dutch patent law]] governing [[cross-border injunction]]s in [[patent infringement]] cases.  Under this doctrine, the Dutch courts would assume [[jurisdiction]] only in cases where the main [[defendant]] (the "spider") was located in the [[Netherlands]] and where the other defendants were part of a group of companies and acted based on a common business policy of this group (the "web"), regardless of the nation in which the disputed [[patent]] was issued.

Decisions by the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) have cast some doubt on the continuing validity of this doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Jochen Buhling, [http://www.buildingipvalue.com/07EU/p.172-175%20Krieger.pdf ''Cross-border injunctions in patent infringement cases: paradise lost?''], Building and enforcing intellectual property value 2007, p172-175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bas Verschoor, [http://www.managingip.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=614871&amp;ReturnPage=5 ''Benelux: Latest Dutch spider developments''], [[Managing Intellectual Property]], March 2006. Consulted on February 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is due in part to the fact that the ECJ did not feel that Dutch courts were competent to make predictions or judgments about the validity of patents granted outside the Netherlands, preferring to grant jurisdiction to the countries in which the patent was granted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsletter-nautadutilh.com/EN/xzine/intellectual_property/patent_newsletter.html?cid=4&amp;xzine_id=3713 ''Dutch cross-border injunctions after Gat v.

A '''spin room''', also known as '''spin row'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reaves|first=Jessica|title=As the Spin Room Turns|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,56609,00.html|work=Time|accessdate=2 October 2012|date=4 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''spin alley''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mathes|first=Michael|title=Spin Alley: getting out the message over debate din|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i-iFl3wU6MNVZvub-ufTpJcw7jig|accessdate=23 October 2012|newspaper=Agence France-Presse|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TribCritic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenthal|first=Phil|title=Spin room coverage out of control|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-09-26/business/0809250750_1_post-debate-spin-operatives|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2 October 2012|date=26 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an area in which [[reporter]]s can speak with [[debate]] participants and/or their representatives after a debate. The name refers to the fact that the participants will attempt to "[[spin (public relations)|spin]]" or influence the perception of the debate among the assembled reporters. The benefit for reporters is that they quickly get in-person interviews with debaters or their representatives, complete with audio, video and photos. For a [[United States presidential election debates|U.S. presidential debate]], the number of reporters in the spin room can number into the thousands.&lt;ref name="TwitterSpin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Calderone|first=Michael|title=For 2012 Presidential Debates, Campaigns Speed Up The Spin|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/01/2012-presidential-debates-spin-room_n_1929185.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2 October 2012|date=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest known spin room was set up by the [[political campaign|campaign]] of U.S. president [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984. In a hotel banquet room, campaign officials spoke on the record with [[talking point]]s playing up their own candidate's debate performance and minimizing opponent [[Walter Mondale]]'s success, despite many observers believing Mondale had just won. This operation was dubbed the "spin patrol."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Santini|first=Maureen|title='Spin patrol' spins out|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=toNGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2229,1288893|accessdate=18 October 2012|newspaper=The Evening News|date=13 October 1984|agency=The Associated Press|location=Newburgh-Beacon, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
A spin room may also be active before a debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Zeke|title=Before The Spin Room, Campaigns Pre-Wash The Press|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/zekejmiller/before-the-spin-room-campaigns-pre-wash-the-press|work=BuzzFeed|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common form of pre-debate spin is for each side to try to raise expectations for the opposing debater and lower expectations for their own team, a pursuit known as playing the [[expectations game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=Leigh Ann|title=What's behind the debate expectations game?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57529085/whats-behind-the-debate-expectations-game/|work=CBS News|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some observers have criticized the overt nature of the [[media manipulation]] in spin rooms, and the media's willing participation in it.&lt;ref name="TribCritic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Jay|title=Raze Spin Alley, That Strange Creation of the Press|url=http://archive.pressthink.org/2003/11/22/spin_alley.html|work=PressThink|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=22 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lanson|first=Jerry|title=The spin room - oily engine of the political meat grinder|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1212/p11s01-coop.htm|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=12 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders have said reporters know it's scripted and aren't persuaded by the spin, but rather, they use the talking points to analyze candidates' strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardman|first1=Isabel|title=A (partial) defence of the spin room|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/04/a-partial-defence-of-the-spin-room/|website=The Spectator|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spin rooms can occasionally include moments of candor, such as when presidential candidate [[Rick Perry]] admitted that he had "stepped in it" during a debate response that became known as his [[Rick Perry presidential campaign, 2012#November 2011: "Oops" moment and continued struggles|"oops" moment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perry in spin room explains flub: "I stepped in it" (with video)|url=http://blogs.star-telegram.com/politex/2011/11/perry-in-spin-room-explains-flub-i-stepped-in-it-with-video.html|website=PoliTex|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spin rooms have also been portrayed as outdated in an era of instant online reaction from all quarters before a debate is even over.&lt;ref name="TwitterSpin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaudin|first=Sharon|title=Twitter becomes new debate spin room|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9232060/Twitter_becomes_new_debate_spin_room|work=Computer World|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Focus group]]s and instant post-debate "snap [[opinion poll|polls]]" attempt to provide a more scientific method than spin rooms in determining who has won a debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US presidential debate: Early polls give Barack Obama slender victory|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/presidentialdebates/3092194/US-presidential-debate-Early-polls-give-Barack-Obama-slender-victory.html|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=15 October 2015|date=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clegg Beats Brown, Cameron in U.K. TV Debate, Polls Show|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-15/clegg-wins-top-mark-in-u-k-debate-polls-as-brown-cameron-stay-deadlocked.html|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=9 November 2012|date=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Texas Tech Administrative Law Journal seal.png|thumb|right|Texas Tech Administrative Law Journal logo]]
The '''''Texas Tech Administrative Law Journal''''' is a student-run [[law review]] discussing developments and issues in [[Texas]] [[administrative law]]. It was established in 2000 and is sponsored by the Administrative and Public Law Section of the [[State Bar of Texas]]. Its staff consists of second and third year law students from the [[Texas Tech University School of Law]].

The journal compiles articles in two annual books. It may be accessed via [[Westlaw]], [[LexisNexis]], and [[HeinOnline]].

==Selection==
The journal selects new members based upon their performance in a write-on competition that is open to first-year students and chooses twenty individuals.

==History==
The journal was founded in 2000 and is the law school's second-oldest journal. The journal will cease publication after the 2018-2019 school year.

{{Tort law}}

A '''tort''', in [[common law]] jurisdictions, is a [[civil wrong]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Glanville Williams]], ... providing grounds for lawsuit. Learning the Law. Eleventh Edition. Stevens. 1982. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; that causes a claimant to suffer loss or harm resulting in [[legal liability]] for the person who commits the tortious act. 

Tort law, where the purpose of any [[Lawsuit|action]] is to obtain a private [[civil remedy]] such as [[damages]], may be compared to [[criminal law]], which deals with [[crime|criminal wrongs]] that are punishable by the state.  Tort law may also be contrasted with [[contract law]] which also provides a civil remedy after breach of duty; but whereas the contractual [[law of obligations|obligation]] is one chosen by the parties, the obligation in both tort and crime is imposed by the state. In both contract and tort, successful claimants must show that [[locus standi|they have suffered]] [[foreseeability|foreseeable]] loss or harm as a [[Causation (law)|direct result]] of the [[Breach of duty in English law|breach of duty]].&lt;ref&gt;Under the [[Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999]] a person may enforce a contract even when they are not a party to it&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;If an employee injures himself in the course and scope of employment, he will be both tortfeasor and claimant under the rule of [[vicarious liability]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The person who commits the act is called a '''tortfeasor'''. Although [[crime]]s may be torts, the [[cause of action|cause of legal action]] in civil torts is not necessarily the result of criminal action; the harm in civil torts may be due to [[negligence]], which does not amount to [[criminal negligence]]. The victim of the harm can recover their loss as [[damages]] in a [[lawsuit]]. In order to prevail, the [[plaintiff]] in the lawsuit, commonly referred to as the '''injured party''', must show that the actions or lack of action was the [[proximate cause|legally recognizable cause]] of the harm. The equivalent of tort in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law jurisdictions]] is "[[delict]]".

'''Legal injuries''' are not limited to [[Physical injury|physical injuries]] and may include emotional, economic,&lt;ref&gt;Note: [[pure economic loss]] is rarely recoverable&lt;/ref&gt;  or reputational injuries as well as violations of [[Privacy law|privacy]], property, or constitutional rights.  Torts comprise such varied topics as [[auto accidents|automobile accidents]], [[false imprisonment]], [[defamation]], [[product liability]], [[copyright infringement]], and environmental pollution ([[toxic torts]]). 

Compared to criminal cases, tort lawsuits have a lower burden of proof, namely "[[preponderance of evidence]]",&lt;ref&gt; where the plaintiff/claimant must prove their case on "a balance of probability"&lt;/ref&gt; rather than [[beyond a reasonable doubt]]. Sometimes a claimant may prevail in a tort case even if the defendant who allegedly caused harm were acquitted in an earlier criminal trial. For example, [[O. J. Simpson]] was acquitted in criminal court of [[murder]] but later found liable for the tort of [[wrongful death]]. 

Both tort law and criminal law may impose liability where there is:
* [[Intention in English law|intentional action]]
* [[Recklessness (law)|reckless behaviour]]
* [[negligence|carelessness]]
* [[product liability]] (without negligence) in the US &amp; the EU
* "innocence" (or blameless inadvertence) ''provided'' there is [[strict liability]].

==History==
{{see also|History of contract law}}
[[Roman law]] contained provisions for torts in the form of [[delict]], which later influenced the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law jurisdictions]] in [[Continental Europe]], but a distinctive body of law arose in the [[common law]] world traced to [[English tort law]]. The word 'tort' was first used in a legal context in the 1580s,&lt;ref&gt;The word is derived from Old French and [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] "tort" (injury), which is derived from [[Medieval Latin]] ''tortum'',. See [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tort&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Online Etymology Dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt; although different words were used for similar concepts prior to this time.

=== Medieval period ===
Torts and crimes at common law originate in the [[Germanic law|Germanic]] system of compensatory [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] for wrongs ([[Old English|OE]] ''unriht''), with no clear distinction between crimes and other wrongs.&lt;ref name=Malone/&gt; In [[Anglo-Saxon law]], most wrongs required payment in money or in kind (''bōt'', literally 'remedy') to the wronged person or their clan.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/560-975dooms.asp Medieval Sourcebook: The Anglo-Saxon Dooms, 560–975]. ''Internet Medieval Source Book'' by Fordham University.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wīte'' (literally 'blame, fault') was paid to the king or holder of a court for disturbances of public order.
''[[Weregild]]'', which was a murder fine based on a victim's worth, was intended to prevent blood [[feud]]s.&lt;ref name=Malone&gt;Malone WS. (1970). ''[http://guweb2.gonzaga.edu/~dewolf/torts/pdf/31louis1.pdf Ruminations on the Role of Fault in the History of the Common Law of Torts]. ''Louisiana Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some wrongs in later law codes were ''botleas'' 'without remedy' (e.g. theft, open murder, arson, treason against one's lord), that is, unable to be compensated, and those convicted of a ''botleas'' crime were at the king's mercy.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce R. O'Brien, "Anglo-Saxon Law", in ''The Oxford International Encyclopedia of Legal History'', vol. 1 (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2009), 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Items or creatures which caused death were also destroyed as [[deodand]]s. Assessing intention was a matter for the court, but [[Alfred the Great]]'s [[Doom Book]] did distinguish unintentional injuries from intentional ones, whereas culpability depended on status, age, and gender.

After the [[Norman Conquest]], fines were paid only to courts or the king, and quickly became a revenue source. A wrong became known as a ''tort'' or ''trespass'', and there arose a division between civil pleas and pleas of the crown.&lt;ref&gt;David Ibbetson, "Tort: English Common Law", in ''The Oxford International Encyclopedia of Legal History'', vol. 5 (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2009), 467.&lt;/ref&gt; The petty assizes (i.e. [[Assize of novel disseisin|of novel disseisin]], [[Assize of mort d'ancestor|of mort d'ancestor]], and [[Assize of darrein presentment|of darrein presentment]]) were established in 1166 as a remedy for interference with possession of freehold land. The [[trespass]] action was an early civil plea in which damages were paid to the victim; if no payment was made, the defendant was imprisoned. The plea arose in local courts for [[slander]], [[breach of contract]], or interference with land, goods, or persons. Although the details of its exact origin are unclear, it became popular in royal courts so that in the 1250s the writ of trespass was created and made ''de cursu'' (available by right, not fee); however, it was restricted to interference with land and forcible breaches of the king's peace. It may have arisen either out of the "appeal of felony", or assize of novel disseisin, or [[replevin]]. Later, after the [[Statute of Westminster 1285]], in the 1360s, the "trespass on the case" action arose for when the defendant did not direct force.&lt;ref name=Malone/&gt; As its scope increased, it became simply "action on the case". The English Judicature Act passed 1873 through 1875 abolished the separate actions of trespass and trespass on the case.&lt;ref name=Malone/&gt;

In 1401, the English case ''[[Beaulieu v Finglam]]'' imposed strict liability for the escape of fire; additionally, strict liability was imposed for the release of cattle.&lt;ref name=Malone/&gt; Negligently handling fire was of particular importance in these societies given capacity for destruction and relatively limited firefighting resources. Liability for [[common carrier]], which arose around 1400, was also emphasized in the medieval period.&lt;ref name=Malone/&gt; Unintentional injuries were relatively infrequent in the medieval period. As transportation improved and carriages became popular in the 18th and [[19th century|19th centuries]], however, collisions and carelessness became more prominent in court records.&lt;ref name=Malone/&gt; In general, scholars of England such as [[William Blackstone]] took a hostile view to litigation, and rules against [[champerty and maintenance]] and [[vexatious litigation]] existed.&lt;ref&gt;Sebok A. (2011). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2103465 What is Wrong with Wrongdoing]. ''[[Florida State University]] Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; The restriction on [[assignment (law)|assignment]] of a cause of action is a related rule based on [[public policy]].

=== English influence ===
The right of victims to receive [[wiktionary:redress|redress]] was regarded by later English scholars as one of the [[rights of Englishmen]].&lt;ref name=Goldberg_2005&gt;Goldberg JCP. (2005). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=789784 The constitutional status of tort law: Due process and the right to a law for the redress of wrongs]. ''Yale Law Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackstone's ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', which was published in the late 18th century, contained a volume on "private wrongs" as torts and even used the word ''tort'' in a few places.&lt;ref name=Goldberg_2005/&gt;

=== United States influence ===
[[United States tort law]] was influenced by English law and Blackstone's ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', with several state constitutions specifically providing for redress for torts&lt;ref name=Goldberg_2005/&gt; in addition to [[reception statute]]s which adopted English law. However, tort law was viewed {{who|date=October 2015|by whom?}} as relatively undeveloped by the mid-19th century; the first American treatise on torts was published in the 1860s but the subject became particularly established when [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr]] wrote on the subject in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=Goldberg_2005/&gt; Holmes' writings have been described as the "first serious attempt in the common law world to give torts both a coherent structure and a distinctive substantive domain",&lt;ref name=Golberg&amp;Zipursky&gt;Goldberg JCP, Zipursky BC. (2010). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1576644 Torts as Wrongs]. ''Texas Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; although Holmes' summary of the history of torts has been critically reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Rustad, Thomas F. Lambert Jr.. [http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/calnan505.htm Book Review of: A Revisionist History of Tort Law: from Holmesian Realism to Neoclassical Rationalism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410024655/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/calnan505.htm |date=10 April 2013 }}. Suffolk University Law School.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1928 US case of [[Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.]] heavily influenced the British judges in the 1932 [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] case of [[ Donoghue v Stevenson]].

=== Modern development ===
The law of torts for various jurisdictions has developed independently. In the case of the United States, a survey of trial lawyers pointed to several modern developments, including strict liability for products based on ''Greenman v. Yuba Power Products'', the limitation of various immunities (e.g. [[sovereign immunity]], [[charitable immunity]]), [[comparative negligence]], broader rules for admitting evidence, increased damages for [[Intentional infliction of emotional distress|emotional distress]], and [[toxic tort]]s and [[class action]] lawsuits. However, there has also been a reaction in terms of [[tort reform]], which in some cases have been struck down as violating state constitutions, and federal preemption of state laws.&lt;ref name=Top10&gt;American Association for Justice (1996). [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Top+10+in+torts%3A+evolution+in+the+common+law.-a018526923 Top 10 in torts: evolution in the common law.].&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern torts are heavily affected by [[insurance]] and [[insurance law]], as most cases are settled through [[claims adjuster|claims adjustment]] rather than by trial, and are defended by insurance lawyers, with the [[insurance policy]], a [[deep pocket]] limit, setting a ceiling on the possible payment.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg JCP. (2008). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1122324 Ten Half-Truths About Tort Law]. ''Valparaiso University Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparative law ==
In the [[comparative law|international comparison]] of modern tort law, common law jurisdictions based upon [[English tort law]] have foundational differences from civil law jurisdiction, which may be based on the Roman concept of [[delict]]. Even among common law countries, however, significant differences exist. For example, in England legal fees of the winner are paid by the loser (the [[English rule (attorney's fees)|English rule]] versus the [[American rule (attorney's fees)|American rule]] of attorney fees). Common law systems include [[United States tort law]], [[Australian tort law]], [[Canadian tort law]], [[Irish tort law]], and [[Delict (Scots law)|Scots Law of Delict]]. The Jewish law of [[Damages (Jewish law)|rabbinic damages]] is another example although tort in [[Israeli law]] is technically similar to English law as it was enacted by [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] authorities in 1944 and took effect in 1947. There is more apparent split between the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (principally England, Canada and Australia) and the United States, although Canada may be more influenced by the United States due to its proximity.&lt;ref name=Cane&gt;Cane P. (2012). [http://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=plr Searching for United States Tort Law in the Antipode]. ''Pepperdine Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has been perceived as particularly prone to filing tort lawsuits even relative to other common law countries, although this perception has been criticized and debated.&lt;ref name=Atiyah&gt;[[Patrick Atiyah|Atiyah PS]]. (1987). [http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3011&amp;context=dlj Tort Law and the Alternatives: Some Anglo-American Comparisons]. ''Duke Law Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1987, class actions were relatively uncommon outside of the United States.&lt;ref name=Atiyah/&gt; As of 1987, English law was less generous to the plaintiff in the following ways: [[contingent fee]] arrangements were restricted, English judges tried more decisions and set [[damages]] rather than juries, wrongful death lawsuits were relatively restricted, punitive damages were relatively unavailable, the [[collateral source rule]] was restricted, and strict liability, such as for product liability, was relatively unavailable.&lt;ref name=Atiyah/&gt; England's welfare state, such as free healthcare through [[National Health Service]], may limit lawsuits.&lt;ref name=Atiyah/&gt; On the other hand, as of 1987 England had no workers compensation system and lawsuits due to workplace injuries were relatively common and facilitated by [[trade union]]s, whereas in the United States the system of workers' compensation insurance prohibits lawsuits against the employer although lawsuits against third parties such as manufacturers does occur.&lt;ref name=Atiyah/&gt; The United States also has faced a rise in [[no-fault insurance]] for automobile liability in several states.&lt;ref name=Atiyah/&gt; In England, [[Ombudsmen#United Kingdom|ombudsmen]]  may also take cases which could alternatively become tort lawsuits.&lt;ref name=Atiyah/&gt;

When comparing Australia and the United States, Australia's tort law is similarly [[state law]]; however, there is a federal common law for torts unlike the United States. The influence of the United States on Australia has been limited. The United States may have influenced Australia's development of strict liability for products indirectly through legislation affected by [[European Union]], and in the 1990s class actions were introduced in Australia.&lt;ref name=Cane/&gt; Australia has [[Health care in Australia|universal healthcare]] and 'welfare state' systems which also limit lawsuits.&lt;ref name=Cane/&gt; In New Zealand, a no-fault accident compensation system has limited the development of personal injury torts.&lt;ref name=Cane/&gt;

== Conflict of laws ==
{{Main article|Conflict of tort laws}}
In certain instances, different jurisdictions' law may apply to a tort, in which case rules have developed for which law to apply. This occurs particularly in the United States, where each of the 50 states may have different [[state law]]s, but also may occur in other countries with a federal system of states, or internationally.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Categories ==
{{Main article|Outline of tort law}}
Torts may be categorized in several ways, with a particularly common division between negligent and intentional torts. [[Quasi-tort]]s may be used to refer to torts which are similar to but somewhat different from typical torts. Particularly in the United States, "collateral tort" is used to refer to torts in [[labour law]] such as [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] ("outrage");&lt;ref&gt;Chamallas M, Vriggins JB. (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=mOCtul09xHMC&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Measure of Injury: Race, Gender, and Tort Law, p. 68].&lt;/ref&gt; or [[wrongful dismissal]]; these evolving [[cause of action|causes of action]] are debated and overlap with [[contract law]] or other legal areas to some degree.&lt;ref name=Gergen&gt;Gergen M. (1995). [http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2468&amp;context=facpubs Grudging Defense of the Role of the Collateral Torts in Wrongful Termination Litigation Employment]. ''Texas Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard action in tort is '''negligence'''.  The tort of negligence provides a cause of action leading to damages, or to relief, in each case designed to protect legal rights, including those of personal safety, property, and, in some cases, intangible economic interests or noneconomic interests such as the tort of [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]] in the United States. Negligence actions include claims coming primarily from car accidents and [[personal injury]] accidents of many kinds, including clinical negligence, worker's negligence and so forth. [[Product liability]] cases, such as those involving warranties, may also be considered negligence actions or, particularly in the United States, may apply regardless of negligence or intention through [[strict liability]].

'''Intentional torts''' include, among others, certain torts arising from the occupation or use of land. The tort of nuisance, for example, involves strict liability for a neighbor who interferes with another's enjoyment of his real property. Trespass allows owners to sue for entrances by a person (or his structure, such as an overhanging building) on their land. Several intentional torts do not involve land. Examples include false imprisonment, the tort of unlawfully arresting or detaining someone, and defamation (in some jurisdictions split into [[libel]] and [[slander]]), where false information is broadcast and damages the plaintiff's reputation.

In some cases, the development of tort law has spurred lawmakers to create alternative solutions to disputes. For example, in some areas, [[workers' compensation]] laws arose as a legislative response to court rulings restricting the extent to which employees could sue their employers in respect of injuries sustained during employment.  In other cases, legal commentary has led to the development of new causes of action outside the traditional common law torts.  These are loosely grouped into '''quasi-torts''' or liability torts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

=== Negligence ===
{{Main article|Negligence}}
Negligence is a tort which arises from the breach of  the [[duty of care]] owed by one person to another from the perspective of a [[reasonable person]]. Although credited as appearing in the United States in ''[[Brown v. Kendall]]'', the later Scottish case of ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 562, followed in England, brought England into line with the United States and established the 'tort of negligence' as opposed to negligence as a component in specific actions.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrari F. (1994). [http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=annlsurvey Donoghue v. Stevenson's 60th Anniversary]. ''Annual Survey of International &amp; Comparative Law''.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Donoghue'', Mrs. Donoghue drank from an opaque bottle containing a decomposed snail and claimed that it had made her ill. She could not sue Mr. Stevenson for damages for breach of contract and instead sued for negligence. The majority determined that the definition of negligence can be divided into four component parts that the plaintiff must prove to establish negligence. The elements in determining the liability for negligence are:{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* The plaintiff was owed a '''duty of care''' through a special relationship (e.g. doctor-patient) or some other principle
* There was a '''dereliction or breach''' of that duty
* The tortfeasor '''directly caused''' the injury [but for the defendant's actions, the plaintiff would not have suffered an injury].
* The plaintiff suffered '''damage''' as a result of that breach
* The damage was not too '''remote'''; there was [[proximate cause]] to show the breach caused the damage
In certain cases, negligence can be assumed under the doctrine of ''[[res ipsa loquitur]]'' (Latin for "the thing itself speaks"); particularly in the United States, a related concept is ''[[negligence per se]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Twerski. (2009). Third Restatement of Torts: Issue One: Article: Negligence Per Se and Res Ipsa Loquitur: Kissing Cousins. ''Wake Forest Law Review''. [http://tortssymposium.law.wfu.edu/papers/twerski.pdf Prepublication copy].&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the business realm, the auditor has a duty of care to the company they are auditing - that the documents created are a true and reliable representation of the company's financial position. However, as per [[Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords|Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v. Peat Marwick Hungerfords]], such auditors do NOT provide a duty of care to third parties who rely on their reports. An exception is where the auditor provides  the third party with a privity letter, explicitly stating the third party can rely on the report for a specific purpose. In such cases, the privity letter establishes a duty of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Sadler|first=Pauline|date=2009|title=Liability for Negligent Misrepresentation in the Finance Industry|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/LegIssBus/2009/3.pdf}} (2009) 11 Legal Issues In Business 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Proximate cause ====
{{Main article|Proximate cause}}
Proximate cause means that you must be able to show that the harm was caused by the tort you are suing for.&lt;ref name="March v Stamare"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1991|litigants=[[March v Stramare (E &amp; MH) Pty Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1991) 171 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 506 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/torts/torts12.htm Ch. 12, Proximate or legal cause] LexisNexis Study Outline.&lt;/ref&gt; The defense may argue that there was a prior cause or a superseding intervening cause. A common situation where a prior cause becomes an issue is the personal injury car accident, where the person re-injures an old injury. For example, someone who has a bad back is injured in the back in a car accident. Years later he is still in pain. He must prove the pain is caused by the car accident, and not the natural progression of the previous problem with the back.  A superseding intervening cause happens shortly after the injury. For example, if after the accident the doctor who works on you commits malpractice and injures you further, the defense can argue that it was not the accident, but the incompetent doctor who caused your injury.

=== Intentional torts ===
{{Main article|Intentional tort}}
Intentional torts are any intentional acts that are reasonably foreseeable to cause harm to an individual, and that do so. Intentional torts have several subcategories:
*Torts against the person include [[assault (tort)|assault]], [[battery (tort)|battery]], [[false imprisonment]], [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]], and [[fraud]], although the latter is also an [[economic tort]].
*Property torts involve any intentional interference with the property rights of the claimant (plaintiff). Those commonly recognized include trespass to land, trespass to chattels (personal property), and conversion.
An intentional tort requires an overt act, some form of intent, and causation. In most cases, transferred intent, which occurs when the defendant intends to injure an individual but actually ends up injuring another individual, will satisfy the intent requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalparalegal.edu/public_documents/courseware_asp_files/torts/againstProperty/transferredIntent.asp|title=Transferred Intent - LawShelf Educational Media|last=|first=|date=|website=nationalparalegal.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010010523/https://lawshelf.com/courseware/entry/transferred-intent|archive-date=2017-10-10|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causation can be satisfied as long as the defendant was a substantial factor in causing the harm.

=== Statutory torts ===
A statutory tort is like any other, in that it imposes duties on private or public parties, however they are created by the legislature, not the courts. For example, the European Union's ''Product Liability Directive'' imposes strict liability for defective products that harm people; such strict liability is not uncommon although not necessarily statutory.

As another example, in England common law liability of a landowner to guests or trespassers was replaced by the [[Occupiers' Liability Act 1957]]; a similar situation occurred in the U.S. State of California in which a judicial common law rule established in ''[[Rowland v. Christian]]'' was amended through a 1985 statute.&lt;ref&gt;''Calvillo-Silva v. Home Grocery'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/19C4t714.htm 19 Cal. 4th 714] (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Statutory torts also spread across workplace health and safety laws and health and safety in food. In some cases federal or state statutes may preempt tort actions, which is particularly discussed in terms of the U.S. [[FDA Preemption]];&lt;ref&gt;Glantz LH, Annas GJ. (2008). [http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0802108 The FDA, Preemption, and the Supreme Court]. ''New England Journal of Medicine''.&lt;/ref&gt; although actions in the United States for medical devices are preempted due to ''[[Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc.]]'' (2008), actions for medical drugs are not due to ''[[Wyeth v. Levine]]'' (2009).

=== Nuisance ===
{{Main article|Nuisance}}
"Nuisance" is traditionally used to describe an activity which is harmful or annoying to others such as indecent conduct or a rubbish heap. Nuisances either affect private individuals (private nuisance) or the general public (public nuisance). The claimant can sue for most acts that interfere with their use and enjoyment of their land. In English law, whether activity was an illegal nuisance depended upon the area and whether the activity was "for the benefit of the commonwealth", with richer areas subject to a greater expectation of cleanliness and quiet.&lt;ref name=Nuisance&gt;Cavert W. (2009). [https://www.academia.edu/202432/A_Right_to_Clean_Air_Coal_Smoke_Property_and_Nuisance_Law_in_Early_Modern_London Right to Clean Air? Coal Smoke, Property, and Nuisance Law in Early Modern London] World Conference on Environmental History.&lt;/ref&gt; The case ''Jones v Powell'' (1629) provides an early example, in which a person's professional papers were damaged by the vapors of a neighboring brewery. Although the outcome of this case is unclear,&lt;ref name=Nuisance/&gt; Whitelocke of the [[Queen's Bench|Court of the King's Bench]] is recorded as saying that since the water supply in area was already contaminated, the nuisance was not actionable as it is "better that they should be spoiled than that the commonwealth stand in need of good liquor".{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In ''[[Rylands v. Fletcher]]'' (1868), strict liability was established for a dangerous escape of some hazard, including water, fire, or animals as long as the cause was not remote. In [[Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc|Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc (1994)]], chemicals from a factory seeped through a floor into the water table, contaminating East Anglia's water reservoirs.&lt;ref name="ElworthyHolder"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elworthy|first1=Sue|last2=Holder|first2=Jane|title=Environmental Protection|date=1 June 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-406-03770-1|page=67|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/law/law-general-interest/environmental-protection-text-and-materials?format=PB&amp;isbn=9780521613538|accessdate=8 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808211159/http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/law/law-general-interest/environmental-protection-text-and-materials?format=PB&amp;isbn=9780521613538|archivedate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Defamation ===
{{Main article|Defamation}}
Defamation is tarnishing the reputation of someone; it has two varieties, ''slander'' and ''libel''. Slander is spoken defamation and libel is printed or broadcast defamation.  The two otherwise share the same features: making a factual assertion for which evidence does not exist. Defamation does not affect or hinder the voicing of opinions, but does occupy the same fields as rights to free speech in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, or Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Related to defamation in the U.S. are the actions for misappropriation of publicity, invasion of privacy, and disclosure. Abuse of process and malicious prosecution are often classified as dignitary torts as well.

=== Business torts ===
{{Main article|Economic tort|Misrepresentation}}
Business torts (i.e., economic torts) typically involve commercial transactions, and include [[tortious interference]] with trade or contract, fraud, injurious falsehood, and negligent misrepresentation. Negligent misrepresentation torts are distinct from contractual cases involving misrepresentation in that there is no [[privity]] of contract; these torts are likely to involve [[pure economic loss]] which has been less-commonly recoverable in tort. One criterion for determining whether economic loss is recoverable is the "foreseeability" doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Christie GC. (1996). [http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1739&amp;context=faculty_scholarship The Uneasy Place of Principle in Tort Law]. ''Duke Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; The economic loss rule is highly confusing and inconsistently applied&lt;ref&gt;Barton RJ. (2000).

''William and Mary Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; and  began in 1965 from a California case involving strict liability for product defects; in 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted the doctrine in ''East River S.S.

Economic antitrust torts have been somewhat submerged by modern [[competition law]]. However, in the United States, private parties are permitted in certain circumstances to sue for anticompetitive practices, including under federal or state statutes or on the basis of common law [[tortious interference]], which may be based upon the [[Restatement of Torts, Second|Restatement (Second) of Torts]] §766.&lt;ref&gt;Saferstein HI. (1990). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40841303 The Ascendancy of Business Tort Claims in Antitrust Practice. ''Antitrust Law Journal''.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Federal laws include the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] of 1890 followed by the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]] which restrict [[cartel]]s and through [[Federal Trade Commission]] regulate [[mergers and acquisitions]].  In the European Union, articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union apply but allowing private actions to enforce antitrust laws is under discussion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Negligent misrepresentation as tort where no contractual [[privity]] exists was disallowed in England by ''[[Derry v Peek]]'' [1889]; however, this position was overturned in ''[[Hedley Byrne v Heller]]'' in 1964 so that such actions were allowed if a "special relationship" existed between the plaintiff and defendant.&lt;ref name=Ballam/&gt; United States courts and scholars "paid lip-service" to ''Derry''; however, scholars such as [[William Prosser (academic)|William Prosser]] argued that it was misinterpreted by English courts.&lt;ref name=Ballam/&gt; The case of ''[[Ultramares Corporation v. Touche]]'' (1932) limited the liability of an [[auditor]] to known identified beneficiaries of the audit and this rule was widely applied in the United States until the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Ballam/&gt; The [[Restatement of Torts, Second|Restatement (Second) of Torts]] expanded liability to "foreseeable" users rather than specifically identified "foreseen" users of the information, dramatically expanding liability and affecting professionals such as [[accountant]]s, [[architect]]s, [[Lawyer|attorney]]s, and [[surveying|surveyors]].&lt;ref name=Ballam/&gt; As of 1989, most U.S. jurisdictions follow either the ''Ultramares'' approach or the Restatement approach.&lt;ref name=Ballam&gt;Ballam DE.

The [[tort of deceit]] for inducement into a contract is a tort in English law, but in practice has been replaced by actions under [[Misrepresentation Act 1967]].&lt;ref&gt;Chen-Wishart M. (2007).

''Oxford University Press''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, similar torts existed but have become superseded to some degree by contract law and the pure economic loss rule.&lt;ref name=Lens2011/&gt; Historically (and to some degree today), fraudulent (but not negligent&lt;ref name=Lens2011/&gt;) misrepresentation involving damages for economic loss may be awarded under the "benefit-of-the-bargain" rule (damages identical to [[expectation damages]] in contracts&lt;ref name=Lens2011/&gt;) which awards the plaintiff the difference between the value represented and the actual value.&lt;ref name=Lens2011/&gt; Beginning with ''Stiles v. White'' (1846) in Massachusetts, this rule spread across the country as a majority rule with the "out-of-pocket damages" rule as a minority rule.&lt;ref name=Lens2011&gt;Lens JW. (2011).

== Liability, defenses, and remedies ==
[[Indirect liability]] may arise due to some involvement, notably through [[joint and several liability]] doctrines as well as forms of [[secondary liability]]. Liability may arise through [[enterprise liability]]. Other concepts include [[market share liability]].

=== Vicarious liability ===
{{Main article|Vicarious liability}}
In certain cases, a person might be liable for their employee or child under the [[law of agency]] through the doctrine of [[respondeat superior]]. For example, if a shop employee spilled cleaning liquid on the supermarket floor and a victim fell and suffered injuries, the plaintiff might be able to sue either the employee or the employer. There is considerable academic debate about whether vicarious liability is justified on no better basis than the search for a solvent defendant, or whether it is well founded on the theory of efficient risk allocation.

=== Defenses ===
{{Main article|Defense (legal)}}
A successful defense absolves the defendant from full or partial liability for damages. Apart from proof that there was no breach of duty, there are three principal defenses to tortious liability.

==== Consent and warning ====
{{Main article|Consent|Waiver}}

Typically, a victim cannot hold another liable if the victim has implicitly or explicitly consented to engage in a risky activity. This is frequently summarized by the maxim "[[volenti non fit injuria]]" (Latin: "to a willing person, no injury is done" or "no injury is done to a person who consents"). In many cases, those engaging in risky activities will be asked to sign a [[waiver]] releasing another party from liability.

For example, spectators to certain sports are assumed to accept a risk of injury, such as a hockey puck or baseball striking a member of the audience. Warnings by the defendant may also provide a defense depending upon the jurisdiction and circumstances. This issue arises, for example, in the [[duty of care]] that landowners have for guests or trespasses, known as occupiers' liability.

==== Comparative or contributory negligence ====
{{Main article|Comparative negligence|Contributory negligence}}
If the victim has contributed to causing their own harm through negligent or irresponsible actions, the damages may be reduced or eliminated entirely. The English case [[Butterfield v. Forrester]] (1809) established this defense. In England, this "[[contributory negligence]]" became a partial defense, but in the United States, any fault by the victim completely eliminated any damages.&lt;ref name=Little2007&gt;Little WBL. (2007). [http://law.campbell.edu/lawreview/articles/30-1-81.pdf "It is Much Easier to Find Fault With Others, Than to be Faultless Ourselves": Contributory Negligence as a Bar to a Claim for Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610164112/http://law.campbell.edu/lawreview/articles/30-1-81.pdf |date=10 June 2010 }}. ''Campbell Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that if the plaintiff was 1% at fault, the victim would lose the entire lawsuit.&lt;ref name=Little2007/&gt; This was viewed as unnecessarily harsh and therefore amended to a [[comparative negligence]] system in many states; as of 2007 contributory negligence exists in only a few states such as North Carolina and Maryland.&lt;ref name=Little2007/&gt;

In comparative negligence, the victim's damages are reduced according to the degree of fault. Comparative negligence has been criticized as allowing a plaintiff who is recklessly 95% negligent to recover 5% of the damages from the  defendant. Economists have further criticized comparative negligence as not encouraging precaution under the [[calculus of negligence]].  In response, many states now have a 50% rule where the plaintiff recovers nothing if the plaintiff is more than 50% responsible.

==== Illegality ====
If the claimant is involved in wrongdoing at the time the alleged negligence occurred, this may extinguish or reduce the defendant's liability. The legal maxim ''[[ex turpi causa non oritur actio]]'', Latin for "no right of action arises from a despicable cause".  Thus, if a burglar is verbally challenged by the property owner and sustains injury when jumping from a second story window to escape apprehension, there is no cause of action against the property owner even though that injury would not have been sustained but for the property owner's intervention.

==== Other defenses and immunities ====
{{Further information|Sovereign immunity|Good Samaritan law|Charitable immunity}}

Historically, immunity has been granted to governments under [[sovereign immunity]] and to charitable organizations under [[charitable immunity]], although these have eroded in the United States.&lt;ref name=Top10/&gt;

Various laws limit liability when giving aid to a person in need; liability can arise from a failure to help due to the [[duty to rescue]].

=== Remedies ===
The main remedy against tortious loss is compensation in [[damages]] or money. In a limited range of cases, tort law will tolerate self-help, such as reasonable force to expel a trespasser. This is a defense against the tort of battery. Further, in the case of a continuing tort, or even where harm is merely threatened, the courts will sometimes grant an [[injunction]], such as in the English case ''[[Miller v Jackson]]'' (1977). This means a command, for something other than money by the court, such as restraining the continuance or threat of harm. Usually injunctions will not impose positive obligations on tortfeasors, but some [[Australia|Australian]] jurisdictions can make an order for [[specific performance]] to ensure that the [[defendant]] carries out their legal obligations, especially in relation to nuisance matters.&lt;ref&gt;Currie, S., &amp; Cameron, D. (2000), "Your Law", ''Nelson Thomson Learning'', Melbourne, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory and reform ==
{{Main article|Tort reform}}
Scholars and lawyers have identified conflicting aims for the law of tort, to some extent reflected in the different types of damages awarded by the courts: [[Damages#Compensatory damages|compensatory]], [[aggravation (law)|aggravated]],&lt;ref&gt;Chapman B. (2008). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1151920&amp;download=yes Punitive Damages as Aggravated Damages: The Case of Contract]. ''Canadian Business Law Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[punitive damages|punitive]]. British scholar [[Glanville Williams]] notes four possible bases on which different torts rested: appeasement, justice, deterrence and compensation.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, G. [1951] "The Aims of the Law of Tort", ''Current Legal Problems'' 137&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1950s a group of legally oriented economists and economically oriented lawyers known as [[law and economics]] scholars emphasized incentives and deterrence, and identified the aim of tort as being the efficient distribution of [[risk]]. [[Ronald Coase]], a principal proponent, argued in ''[[The Problem of Social Cost]]'' (1960) that the aim of tort law, when [[transaction cost]]s are high, should be to reflect as closely as possible the allocation of risk and liability at which private parties arrive when transaction costs are low.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Coase, R. H. |year=1960 |title=The Problem of Social Cost |journal=The Journal of Law and Economics |volume=3 |pages=1–44  |doi=10.1086/466560|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9932210/becker%2cbergstresser%2csubramanian-Does_Shareholder_Proxy.pdf?sequence=1}}, reprinted in {{Cite book|author=Coase, R. H. |year=1990 |title=The Firm, the Market and the Law |publisher=Chicago University Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-11101-6 |pages=''pp''95–156 }}, [https://www.sfu.ca/~allen/CoaseJLE1960.pdf online version] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503021515/http://www.sfu.ca/~allen/CoaseJLE1960.pdf |date=3 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-to-late 20th century, calls for reform of tort law have come from various perspectives. Some calls for reform stress the difficulties encountered by potential claimants. For example, because not all people who have accidents can find solvent defendants from which to recover damages in the courts, [[P. S. Atiyah]] has called the situation a "damages lottery".&lt;ref&gt;Atiyah, P. S. (1997) ''The Damages Lottery''&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in [[New Zealand]], the government in the 1960s established a no-fault system of state compensation for accidents. Similar proposals have been the subject of [[command paper]]s in the UK and much academic debate.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

In the U.S., reform has typically limited the scope of tort law and damages available, such as limiting [[joint and several liability]], the [[collateral source rule]], or capping noneconomic damages for [[Intentional infliction of emotional distress|emotional distress]] or [[punitive damages]]. These reform statutes are sometimes rejected as unconstitutional under the [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] by [[state supreme court]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz VE. (1997). [http://www.shb.com/attorneys/SchwartzVictor/WhoShouldMakeAmericasTortLaw.pdf Who Should Make America's Tort Law: Courts Or Legislatures?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729095320/http://www.shb.com/attorneys/SchwartzVictor/WhoShouldMakeAmericasTortLaw.pdf |date=29 July 2013 }}. Also see [http://www.wlf.org/Publishing/publication_detail.asp?id=1213 Publication record]. [[Washington Legal Foundation]].&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution]] possibly also relevant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140117103103/http://articles.cobenlaw.com/articles/competing-tort-law-forums-courts-vs-legislatures/ Competing Tort Law Forums: Courts vs. Legislatures]. Coben &amp; Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical and policy considerations are central to fixing liability for [[pure economic loss]] and of public bodies.

== Relationship to contract law ==
{{See|#Business torts}}

Tort is sometimes viewed as the causes of action which are not defined in other areas such as [[contract]] or [[fiduciary]] law.&lt;ref name=Harpwood&gt;Harpwood V. (2009). [http://www.routledgelaw.com/textbooks/9780415458467/downloads/sample.pdf Modern Tort Law, 7th Edition]. Routledge. [http://www.routledgelaw.com/textbooks/9780415458467/downloads/sample.pdf Ch. 1 available as sample].&lt;/ref&gt; However, tort and contract law are similar in that both involve a breach of duties, and in modern law these duties have blurred&lt;ref name=Harpwood/&gt; and it may not be clear whether an action "[[wiktionary:sound|sounds]] in tort or contract"; if both apply and different standards apply for each (such as a [[statute of limitations]]), courts will determine which is the "[[gravamen]]" (the most applicable). Circumstances such as those involving professional negligence&lt;ref name=Harpwood/&gt; may involve both torts and contracts. The choice may affect time limits or damages, particularly given that damages are typically relatively limited in contract cases while in tort cases noneconomic [[damages]] such as [[pain and suffering]] may be awarded.&lt;ref name=Harpwood/&gt; [[Punitive damage]]s are relatively uncommon in contractual cases versus tort cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Timothy J.|date=1976|title=Punitive damages in the law of contract: the reality and the illusion of legal change.|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1504&amp;context=facpubs|journal=Minnesota Law Review|volume=61|pages=207|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216042004/http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1504&amp;context=facpubs|archivedate=16 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, compensation for defective but not unsafe products is typically available only through contractual actions&lt;ref name=Harpwood/&gt; through the law of [[warranty]].

In the United Kingdom, plaintiffs in professional negligence cases have some degree of choice in which law while in commercial transactions contract law applies; in unusual cases, intangible losses have been awarded in contract law cases.&lt;ref name=Harpwood/&gt;

The English case [[Hadley v Baxendale|''Hadley v. Baxendale'']] (1854), which was adopted in the United States, split contract and tort damages by foreseeability of the damages when the contract was made.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/publications/under_construction/2016/winter2016/economic_loss_rule.html|title=A “Simple” Explanation of the Economic-Loss Rule  {{!}} Forum on the Construction Industry|last=|first=|date=|website=www.americanbar.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506124315/http://www.americanbar.org/publications/under_construction/2016/winter2016/economic_loss_rule.html|archive-date=6 May 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-03-25|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[pure economic loss]] rule was adopted to further prevent negligence lawsuits in breach of contract cases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This "economic loss rule" was adopted by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ''East River Steamship Corp V Transamerica Delaval Inc.'' (1986) and expanded across the country in a non-uniform manner, leading to confusion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Among other examples, the tort of [[insurance bad faith]] arises out of a contractual relationship, and "collateral torts" such as [[wrongful dismissal]] involving possible overlap with [[labour law]] contracts.&lt;ref name=Gergen/&gt;

== Overlap with criminal law ==
There is some overlap between criminal law and tort. For example, in [[English law]] an assault is both a crime and a tort (a form of trespass to the person). A tort allows a person, usually the victim, to obtain a remedy that serves their own purposes (for example by the payment of [[damages]] to a person injured in a car accident, or the obtaining of [[injunctive relief]] to stop a person interfering with their business). Criminal actions on the other hand are pursued not to obtain remedies to assist a person{{spaced ndash}}although often criminal courts do have power to grant such remedies{{spaced ndash}}but to remove their liberty on the state's behalf. This explains why [[incarceration]] is usually available as a penalty for serious crimes, but not usually for torts. In early common law, the distinction between crime and tort was not distinct.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons KW. (2007). [http://www.bu.edu/lawlibrary/facultypublications/PDFs/Simons/Crim_Torts_Distinction.pdf The Crime/Tort Distinction: Legal Doctrine And Normative Perspectives]. ''Widener Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The more severe penalties available in criminal law also means that it requires a higher [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] to be discharged than the related tort. For example, in the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O. J. Simpson murder trial]], the jury was not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that [[O. J. Simpson]] had committed the crime of [[murder]]; but in a later civil trial, the jury in that case decided that there was sufficient evidence to meet the standard of [[preponderance of the evidence]] required to prove the tort of [[wrongful death]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rufo v. Simpson'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/86CA4t573.htm 86 Cal. App. 4th 573] (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many jurisdictions, especially the US, retain [[punitive damages|punitive]] elements in tort damages, for example in anti-trust and consumer-related torts, making tort blur the line with criminal acts. Also there are situations where, particularly if the defendant ignores the orders of the court, a plaintiff can obtain a punitive remedy against the defendant, including imprisonment. Some torts may have a public element{{spaced ndash}}for example, [[nuisance|public nuisance]]{{spaced ndash}}and sometimes actions in tort will be brought by a public body. Also, while criminal law is primarily punitive, many jurisdictions have developed forms of monetary compensation or restitution which criminal courts can directly order the defendant to pay to the victim.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The '''''Tulane Law Review''''', a publication of the [[Tulane University Law School]], was founded in 1916, and is currently published six times annually.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.tulane.edu/lawreview/&lt;/ref&gt; The Law Review has an international circulation and is one of few American [[law reviews]] carried by law libraries in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlsstudentlife/index.aspx?id=620&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Law Review was started by [[Rufus Carrollton Harris]], the school's twelfth dean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,930909,00.html | work=Time | title=Education: Dean Upped | date=March 8, 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Charles E. Dunbar|Charles E. Dunbar, Jr.]], the [[civil service]] reformer who became a Tulane law professor, served on the board of advisory editors of ''Tulane Law Review'' from its inception until his death in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site21.php|title=Dunbar, Charles E.|publisher=''A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography'' (lahistory.org)|accessdate=December 16, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925003659/http://www.lahistory.org/site21.php|archivedate=September 25, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1937 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' [[magazine]] about Rufus Harris describes the Tulane Law Review as "nationally famed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,930909,00.html | work=Time | title=Education: Dean Upped | date=March 8, 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law Review was most recently cited by the [[United States Supreme Court]] on April 27, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1198.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Membership to the Tulane Law Review is conferred upon Tulane law students who have "outstanding scholastic records or demonstrated ability in legal research and writing."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlsstudentlife/index.aspx?id=620&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, membership is chosen based on a student's law school grades and/or performance in an annual anonymous writing competition.

The '''Committee on the Philippines''' was a [[standing committee]] of the [[United States Senate]] from 1899 to 1921.{{ref|stubbs}} The committee was established by Senate resolution on December 15, 1899, to oversee administration of the [[Philippines]], which Spain had ceded to the United States as part of the settlement of the [[Spanish–American War]]. The committee was established by Senate resolution on December 15, 1899, even though the treaty of December 10, 1899, had not yet been ratified.{{ref|nara}}

In 1921, the Committee  was terminated and jurisdiction over legislative matters concerning the Philippines was transferred to the newly created [[United States Senate Committee on Territories and Insular Possessions|Committee on Territories and Insular Possessions]].{{ref|nara}}

{{TOClimit|3}}

==History==
At the time of the creation of the committee, the Philippines were in a state of civil turmoil that greatly concerned the Senate, where a debate raged between those who wished to extend U.S. sovereignty over the Filipinos and the [[anti-imperialist]]s. Like the [[United States Senate Committee on the Pacific Islands and Puerto Rico|Committee on the Pacific Islands and Puerto Rico]], the [[Committee on the Philippines]] focused on primarily on legal and economic matters, such as [[Republic Day (Philippines)|Philippine independence]], administration of the islands by the [[Taft Commission|U.S. Philippine Commission]], and trade issues. Matters relating to the suppression of the Philippine insurrection were often referred to the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]].{{ref|nara}}

===Chairmen===
* [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] (R-MA) 1899-1911
* [[Simon Guggenheim]] (R-CO) 1911-1913
* [[Gilbert M. Hitchcock]] (D-NE) 1913-1918
* [[John F. Shafroth]] (D-CO) 1918-1919
* [[Warren Harding]] (R-OH) 1919-1921

==Lodge Committee==
[[Henry Cabot Lodge]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] of [[Massachusetts]], was the committee's first chairman, serving until 1911. During this time, the committee was informally known as the ''Lodge Committee.'' In 1902, under Chairman Lodge, the committee carried out an investigation into  allegations of [[war crime]]s in the [[Philippine–American War]]. The hearings commenced on January 31, 1902{{ref|start}} and adjourned on June 28, 1902.{{ref|finish}} They were closed to the public, except for three press associations.{{ref|feb13}} The final report came to 3,000 pages.{{ref|little}}

A remark to a ''[[Manila News]]'' reporter by newly promoted [[Brigadier General]] [[Jacob H. Smith]] on November 4, 1901, triggered the hearings, which eventually led to Smith's own [[court-martial]] and conviction. Smith said that he intended to set the entire island of [[Samar]] ablaze, and would probably wipe out most of the population.{{ref|manila}}

[[George Frisbie Hoar|Senator George Frisbie Hoar]] had been demanding an investigation after increasing evidence of U.S. military war crimes in the [[Philippine–American War]]. Hoar introduced a resolution to establish a [[select or special committee (United States Congress)|select committee]] to conduct the investigation on January 13, 1902.{{ref|introduced}} However, [[Henry Cabot Lodge|Chairman Lodge]] argued that the hearings would be better conducted by the existing Committee on the Philippines. [[Anti-imperialism|Anti-imperialists]] in the Senate feared a [[whitewash]], because Lodge had been avoiding investigating mounting allegations of war crimes so much so that the U.S. Senate Committee on the Philippines had been inactive for several months.

During the time of the committee investigation, the minority on the committee consisted of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] anti-imperialists, led by [[George Frisbie Hoar|Senator Hoar]], while the majority was dominated by imperialists, led by [[Henry Cabot Lodge|Chairman Lodge]].{{ref|committee}} Hearings often degenerated into shouting matches between the imperialists and anti-imperialists. Nothing came of the hearings.{{ref|Oregon}}

==Investigation==

===Initial hearings===
[[File:William Howard Taft.jpg|thumb|125px|William Howard Taft]]

[[William Howard Taft|Governor William Howard Taft]] had arrived in the Philippines in June 1900 with the [[Taft Commission]] to set up a civilian government. Taft was the first to testify in the Lodge Committee. As a lawyer, Taft would be assumed to have been a safe witness, but he conceded under questioning that "the torturing of natives by so-called water-cure and other methods" had been used "on some occasions to extract information"..."There are some amusing instances of Filipinos who came in and said they would not say anything unless tortured; that they must have an excuse for what they proposed to say."{{ref|Taft}} As Miller writes, "Very few died from the water cure, a mild form of torture."

Taft was immediately followed by three pro-imperialist witnesses. General [[Robert P. Hughes]], chief of staff to General [[Elwell S. Otis]],{{ref|Bohol}} testified for two weeks in March 1902.{{ref|mar5}}{{ref|mar6}}{{ref|mar8}}{{ref|mar11}}{{ref|2mar11}} In his testimony, Hughes conceded that Filipino houses were burned indiscriminately as a strategy to eliminate shelters and hiding places for guerrillas and as a deterrent. During questioning, Senator [[Charles Henry Dietrich|Charles Dietrich]] followed up by asking Hughes to estimate the value of these houses.  Hughes said they only took a few days to build, and cost between $1.50 and $4.00. Senator [[Joseph Lafayette Rawlins|Joseph Rawlins]] continued the questioning:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Rawlins:'' If these shacks were of no consequence what was the utility of their destruction?&lt;br&gt;
''Hughes:'' The destruction was a punishment. They permitted these people to come in there and conceal themselves and they gave no sign. It is always--&lt;br&gt;
''Rawlins:'' The punishment in that case would fall, not upon the men, who could go elsewhere, but mainly upon the women and little children.&lt;br&gt;
''Hughes:'' The women and children are part of the family, and where you wish to inflict a punishment you can punish the man probably worse in that way than in any other.&lt;br&gt;
''Rawlins:'' But is that within the ordinary rules of civilized warfare? Of course you could exterminate the family which would be still worse punishment.&lt;br&gt;
''Hughes:'' These people are not civilized.&lt;br&gt;
''Rawlins:'' But is that within the ordinary rules of civilized warfare?&lt;br&gt;
''Hughes:'' No; I think it is not.&lt;br&gt;
''Dietrich:'' In order to carry on civilized warfare both sides have to engage in such warfare.&lt;br&gt;
''Hughes:'' Yes sir; certainly that is the point, I think that if I am allowed to go on I will come to a place where I shall have something to say that will bear directly on the subject.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Senator Hale commented that the war had become less and less civilized with each successive commander, to which Hughes agreed saying "from summer to summer, the conduct of the war was sterner, stiffer, as you call it."{{ref|Hughes}}

[[File:David J. Barrows.JPG|thumb|125px|David P. Barrows]]
[[David Prescott Barrows]], school director in the Philippines testified, claiming that anti-imperialist factions in the press had grossly distorted the situation. For example, concentration camps and the [[water cure (torture)|water cure]] were explained in the press as "more terrible than they are." He claimed Filipinos in the camps were "there of their own volition", for they "are pleased with it, because they are permitted to lead an easier life--much easier than at home."  He went on to claim that alleged torture via the water cure "injured no one." While stating his belief that the natives had benefited from the war, Barrows stated he did not "wish to assent to the proposition that war is a good thing...but where you have a war existing, it is, I think, better to go ahead and pursue it rigorously and finish it."{{ref|Barrows}}

[[File:General otis.JPG|thumb|125px|General Elwell Stephen Otis]]
A fourth witness, [[Elwell S. Otis|General Elwell Stephen Otis]] testified the week of March 20,{{ref|mar20}}{{ref|2mar21}} claiming here had been no warfare in the Philippines for the past two years. Senator Hale questions that statement, saying "there have been a good many fights since." Otis alleged any such fighting was due to "robbers", and that he and his men "were laughed at by the Spaniards and European officers for the humanity that we exercised."{{ref|Otis}} The committee proceeded to take a two-week break before continuing with hearings.{{ref|MacArthur}}

===Hearings continue===
Major [[Cornelius Gardener]], a [[West Point]] graduate serving as provincial governor of [[Tayabas Province|Tayabas]], the province next to [[Batangas]], submitted a report to the committee, which Chairman Lodge laid before the committee on April 10, 1902.{{ref|Gardener1}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of late by reason of the conduct of the troops, such as the extensive burning of the barrios in trying to lay waste the country so that the insurgents cannot occupy it, the torturing of natives by so-called water cure and other methods, in order to obtain information, the harsh treatment of natives generally, and the failure of inexperienced, lately appointed Lieutenants commanding posts, to distinguish between those who are friendly and those unfriendly and to treat every native as if he were, whether or no, an insurrecto at heart, this favorable sentiment above referred to is being fast destroyed and a deep hatred toward us engendered.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The course now being pursued in this province and in the Provinces of Batangas, Laguna, and Samar is in my opinion sowing the seeds for a perpetual revolution against us hereafter whenever a good opportunity offers. Under present conditions the political situation in this province is slowly retrograding, and the American sentiment is decreasing and we are daily making permanent enemies.{{ref|Gardener}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Committee on the Philippines refused to subpoena Major Cornelius Gardener in a May 1, party-line vote.{{ref|may1}} Committee members Senator [[Thomas MacDonald Patterson|Thomas Patterson]] decried this move in a speech on the Senate floor. Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[South Carolina]], similarly objected to this move, claiming information was being "smothered."{{ref|smothered}}

===Emilo Aguinaldo===
Democrats on the committee pressed Lodge to call as witnesses [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], the Filipino general and independence leader, and several others they thought necessary for the committee to hear. In addition to Mr. Auguinaldo, Mr. Rawlings proposed calling [[Apolinario Mabini]], one of Aguinaldo's principal advisors; [[Sixto Lopez]], an advocate for [[Republic Day (Philippines)|Philippine independence]]; Judge [[Pío del Pilar]], General Torres, [[Howard W. Bray]], an Englishman, who has spent many years in the Philippines, [[Robert M. Collins]], and [[Harold Martin (journalist)|Harold Martin]], both [[Associated Press]] correspondents. The committee refused this request as well as one that would have sent a subcommittee to the Philippines to collect testimony.{{ref|NYT1}}{{ref|smothered}}{{ref|may1}}

Instead, Mr. Lodge subpoenaed several veterans from a so-called "safe list" supplied by Secretary of War [[Elihu Root]]. However, when the soldiers appeared, they began to lecture the committee on the necessity of shooting and burning all Filipinos because of their "inability to appreciate human kindness."{{ref|exsoldiers}}

Sergeant L. E. Hallock, Private William J. Gibbs, George C. Boardman, Captain Lee Hall, [[Richard Garrick|Richard Thomas O'Brien]] all testified to what they had seen during their service in the Philippines, including torture of Filipino prisoners, including use of the [[water cure (torture)|water cure]], murder of natives, and other harassment.{{ref|may4}}{{ref|may10}}{{ref|may15}}{{ref|may19}}{{ref|may21}}

Chairman Lodge countered with details of the murder of Private O'Herne. The witness said that in June 1900, O'Herne, with two other members of the company, had been sent to Iloilo for mail, and that on their return, on June 30, they were ambushed by 100 natives, and O'Herne's companions captured. O'Herne had made a dash to get away, and after escaping from the attacking party, had fallen in with other natives supposed to be friendly, but that instead of proving to be so they had devoted the entire next day to his torture and death, beginning at daylight by cutting him with bolos and then roasting him all day by a slow fire, not finishing up until night. All these details had, the witness said, been gathered from the confessions of the men to whom they had given the cure. Sergeant Hallock described the torture of around a dozen natives at the town of [[Leon, Panay]]. He said they were captured and tortured in order to secure information of the murder of Private O'Herne.

Corporal Richard O'Brien, testified he had been present at [[Igbaras]] when the water cure was administered to the Presidente (or chief) of that town. "There was a Spanish woman in town--a woman of education--who was attacked by the American officers."  The witness said he could not give the names of the officers, adding that he had not witnessed the incident, but that the woman's husband was his authority for the statement." O'Brien further testified that there was an "unwritten law out there to take no prisoners."  He said [[Dum-dum|"dum dum" bullets]], or expanding bullets, were issued in the regular way with other ammunition.  He had seen them strike a man and take the top of this head off.

===General Arthur MacArthur===
[[File:Arthur MacArthur Jr.jpg|thumb|125px|Arthur MacArthur, Jr.]]
General MacArthur testified before the committee twice. On April 13, he initially discussed the short war with the Spaniards and the American cooperation with the Filipinos.{{ref|apr13}} Then later that month, he testified again, regarding the capture of [[Emilio Aguinaldo]].{{ref|apr30}}{{ref|may1}}{{ref|may2}}{{ref|may3}} The General testified he had used deception to capture Mr. Aguinaldo, saying "I am responsible in that matter in every way and particular. It was one of the deceptions frequently practiced in war, and whatever deception attached thereto, I take." He attributed the plan to  Gen. Funston, but said he (MacArthur) was responsible for approving the plant. However, he insisted doing so did not violate the rules of civilized warfare. MacArthur also distanced himself from any alleged orders of General [[Jacob H. Smith]] to turn [[Samar]] a howling wilderness.

MacArthur said that absolute chaos would result should the Filipinos be given complete independence and the United States entirely withdraw from the islands. Aguinaldo also had told him it would be impossible at this stage of their evolution for his own people to establish a stable independent Government. He said Aguinaldo was at the time of the conversation a "qualified prisoner", but that there was no coercion or duress resorted to extract the statement.

In regards to the death toll in the Philippines, he said, "The destruction is simply incident to war, and of course embraces a very small percentage of the total population, which is dense." In response, Senator Patterson noted that the death toll in one province was nearly a third. Gen. MacArthur spoke of the capture of papers from high Filipino officials in which the information was contained that, if President McKinley should be re-elected, the insurgents would surrender to the authority of the United States.{{ref|MacArthur2}}

===Alleged war crimes===

====Concentration camps====
Colonel Arthur L. Wagner, the [[U.S. Army|Army's]] chief public relations officer,{{ref|Wagner}} had spent two and a half years in the Philippines. Wagner testified in May, where he was questioned about [[concentration camps]] in the Philippines,{{ref|may29}} 31{{ref|may30}} including deaths at the camps. In one camp, it was reported that the people were assembled according to villages, so that the people in all cases would have their old neighbors near them. So far as he had been able to observe, there was no evidence of want among the people there congregated. Moreover, they were surprisingly contented. Such camps, he insisted, were created to "protect friendly natives from the insurgents" and to "assure them an adequate food supply", while also teaching them "proper sanitary standards."{{ref|Wagner}} People were limited to travel within 300 to 800 yards of the camp, beyond which was a so-called "dead line" that anyone caught crossing would be shot, though he claimed the standing order was not to shoot any helpless persons, or any others if the shooting could be avoided.

Colonel Wagner said that one of the principal purposes of concentrating the native people in the Philippines was to protect them against the [[Wanshan Archipelago|Ladrones]], which had been admirably accomplished. Another object of the camps had been that of facilitating the collection of the rice supplies in order to starve out the Ladrones and guerrillas. The result had been that hostile parties had practically disappeared and their leader, Malvar, had been captured. The policy had been necessary to "protect life and property, and he did not see how any other policy could have been successful. He said that the people were fed and given medical supplies, and the sanitation of the camps was looked after. He insisted that American camps in the Philippines no more could be compared to [[Valeriano Weyler]]'s [[reconcentrado camps]] in Cuba than mercy could be compared to cruelty.

Over loud Republican protests, [[Charles Allen Culberson|Senator Culberson]] began to read a letter from one of [[J. Franklin Bell]]'s officers, which had been quoted in the Senate by Mr. Bacon, in which the officer described a concentration camp as a "suburb of hell." The chair ruled that unless the senator identified the author, who had asked to remain anonymous, it was "hearsay evidence" and directed the witness not to comment on it. But Culberson had already read part of the letter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What a farce it all is . . . this little spot of black sogginess is a reconcentrado pen, with a dead line outside, beyond which everything living is shot...Upon arrival, I found 30 cases of smallpox, and average fresh ones of five a day, which practically have to be turned out to die. At nightfall crowds of huge vampire bats softly swirl out of their orgies over the dead. Mosquitos work in relays. This corpse-carcass stench wafts in and combined with some lovely municipal odors besides makes it slightly unpleasant here.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Torture of Filipinos====
Col. Wagner said he had no personal knowledge of the tortures of the natives in the Philippines, but he gave several instances in which he had heard reports of torture. In most of these it was found on examination that the reports either were untrue or exaggerated.

Wagner said that he knew that one village had been burned because the citizens would not give information of the murderers of a native friendly to the United States.

After intense cross examination, Wagner agreed that some "innocents" had suffered in the Philippines, but he added that the same was true of every war and that it was an injustice as old as man.  "The Almighty destroyed Sodom, notwithstanding the fact there were a few just people in that community." Senator [[Albert J. Beveridge|Albert Beveridge]] replied, "I was thinking of that instance of Sodom and Gomorrah."{{ref|Wagner}}

===Senator Beveridge's conclusions===

Senator Albert Beveridge published a separate senate document containing his views on the committee, published as Senate Document 422 in the [[57th Congress]], 1st session. Historian Miller criticized this secondary publication, calling it a "deceitful [[cut and paste job]] . . . gleaning from the record anything that remotely supported his conclusion that the war was one of the most humane ones in history . . . [Beveridge felt that] the Lodge committee had destroyed the malicious fiction of "the slanders of the Army".{{ref|whitewash}}

'''''Vo v France''''' is a 2004 court case heard by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] that is notable for raising the question of whether or not an unborn child is considered to have a right to life under Article 2 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="HRLR"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://hrlr.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/2/311.abstract|title=A Foetal Right to Life? The Case of ''Vo v France''|first=Aurora|last=Plomer|journal=Human Rights Law Review|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|volume=5|number=2|pages=311–338|doi=10.1093/hrlr/ngi017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The case was brought by Mrs Vo, a French woman with Vietnamese heritage. During her pregnancy, Vo received substandard medical care—due in part to a mixup with another woman with a similar name, and Vo's lack of ability to speak French. This confusion led to her doctors attempting to remove a non-existent coil from her uterus, but in the process damaging her foetus. This led to her needing emergency hospital admission and the death of the foetus, which was between 20 and 21 weeks old at the time.&lt;ref name="HRLR" /&gt;

Mrs Vo attempted to have the doctor prosecuted for unintentionally killing her unborn child. On 3 June 1996, the French criminal court found the doctor innocent as the foetus was not considered viable, and thus was not a "human person" under the [[French Criminal Code]] (then Article 319, now Articles 221—226).&lt;ref name="HRLR" /&gt;

The Lyons Court of Appeal reversed the decision made by the court of first instance on 3 March 1997. This appellate decision was reversed again by the Court of Cassation on 30 June 1999.&lt;ref name="HRLR" /&gt;

Mrs Vo brought the case to the European Court of Human Rights, charging that the French government's failure to provide criminal penalties for accidentally destroying a foetus was incompatible with the state's duty to protect the right to life of the unborn child under Article 2. The case was heard by the Grand Chamber of the Strasbourg court.&lt;ref name="HRLR" /&gt;

== Decision ==

The European Court of Human Rights broke the issue into two components:

# Does Article 2 apply to unborn children?
# Does Article 2 require that criminal penalties must apply to unintentional homicides?

The court decided that the first of these questions can be sidestepped by means of the second question. The French government had not breached their duties under the Convention by not applying criminal penalties to the unintentional destruction of a foetus. The court then decided that the first question could thus be ignored, noting that the Convention and its subsequent jurisprudence had not "ruled out the possibility that in certain circumstances safeguards may be extended to the unborn child".&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Hogan, 12th edition, p. 567&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Voting rights of citizens in Guam''' differ from those of United States citizens in each of the fifty states. In the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], [[Guam]] is entitled to a [[Guam's at-large congressional district|delegate]], who is not allowed to vote on the floor of the House, but can vote on procedural matters and in House committees. Citizens of Guam may not vote in general elections for President.

The [[United States Constitution]] grants congressional voting representation to the states, of which Guam is not one. Guam is a [[federal territory]] ultimately under the complete authority of Congress. The lack of voting representation in Congress for residents of Guam has been an issue since the foundation of the federal district.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The [[Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act|Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA)]] is a United States federal law dealing with elections and voting rights for United States citizens residing overseas. The act requires that all U.S. states, the District of Columbia, [[Puerto Rico]], Guam, [[American Samoa]], and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] allow certain U.S. citizens to register to vote and to vote by [[absentee ballot]] in federal elections.&lt;ref name=UOCAVA&gt;{{cite web|title=Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (as modified by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2005). U.S. Department of Justice; Civil Rights Division; Voting Section. December 31, 1987. Archived from the original on 2008-07-17. |url=http://www.fvap.gov/laws/uocavalaw.html |accessdate=23 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080717085438/http://www.fvap.gov/laws/uocavalaw.html |archivedate=July 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The act is Public Law 99-410 and was signed into law by President [[Ronald Reagan]] on August 28, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Kevin J. "Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act: Background and Issues." Congressional Research Service. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. citizenship==
Guam is an unincorporated United States territory. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 expanded the definition of the "United States" for nationality purposes to include Guam, therefore those born on Guam are "U.S. [citizens] at birth on the same terms as persons born in other parts of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;https://fam.state.gov/FAM/08FAM/08FAM030201.html#M302_1_3_B&lt;/ref&gt; If a U.S. citizen born on Guam were to move to the mainland, they would be able to participate in all elections any other U.S. citizen can participate in.

==History==
On August 1, 1950, President Truman signed into law the [[Guam Organic Act of 1950]], which gave the [[Chamorro people]] certain rights and protections under the U.S. Constitution. The people of Guam were afforded the opportunity to set and administer policy and laws for the island of Guam.
In the 1980s and early 1990s, there was a significant movement in favor of the territory becoming a commonwealth, which would give it a level of self-government similar to Puerto Rico and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. However, the federal government rejected the version of a commonwealth that the government of Guam proposed, due to it having clauses incompatible with the [[Territorial Clause]] (Art. IV, Sec. 3, cl. 2) of the U.S. Constitution. Other movements are also in existence that advocate becoming a U.S. state, union with the state of Hawaii, union with the Northern Mariana Islands as a single territory, or independence.

==Guam's government==
Guam is governed by a popularly elected governor and a [[unicameral]] 15-member legislature, whose members are known as senators. Guam elects one non-voting delegate, currently Democrat [[Madeleine Z. Bordallo]], to the United States House of Representatives. U.S. citizens in Guam vote in a [[straw poll]] for their choice in the U.S. Presidential general election, but since Guam has no votes in the Electoral College, the poll has no real effect. However, in sending delegates to the Republican and Democratic national conventions, Guam does have influence in the national presidential race, though these convention delegates are elected by local party conventions rather than voters in primaries.&lt;ref name=Landfall&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Robert F.|title=Destiny's Landfall: A History of Guam.|year=1995|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=978-0-8248-1678-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''War Crimes Act 1991''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It confers jurisdiction on courts in the [[United Kingdom]] to try people for [[war crimes]] committed in [[Nazi Germany]] or German-occupied territory during the [[World War II|Second World War]] by people who were not British citizens at the time, but have since become British citizens or residents. The legislation was enacted, as there then were no provisions to allow the extradition of [[British resident]]s, or [[naturalised citizen]]s to face trial for war crimes in third countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/274989.stm Prosecution prepares war crimes trial] ''[[BBC News]], [[news.bbc.co.uk]]'', 8 February 1999 (accessed 10 January 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, such as the [[United States]] have used [[Civil law (common law)|civil]], rather than [[criminal law|criminal]] proceedings, to resolve this issue by revoking citizenship of suspects, facilitating their deportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1525553.stm Unhappy record on Nazi suspects] ''[[BBC News]], [[news.bbc.co.uk]]'', 8 February 1999 (accessed 10 January 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was rejected by the [[House of Lords]], and so it was passed with the authority of only the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], under the provisions of the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]]. The Parliament Acts are rarely invoked: the War Crimes Act was only the fourth statute since 1911 enacted under their provisions, and the first since the Parliament Act 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2010-04-08a.462.0|house=House of Lords|date=8 April 2010|column=462-463|title=Parliament Acts: House of Lords written question – answered on 8th April 2010.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The War Crimes Act remains the only time that the Parliament Acts were invoked by a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government.

To date only one person, [[Anthony Sawoniuk]], has been convicted under the Act. In 1999, he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] for [[murder]] during his involvement with the collaborationist [[Belarusian Auxiliary Police]]. He died in jail in 2005.

The first person to be charged, however, was fellow Belarusian officer, Symon Serafinowicz Sr. His trial commenced in 1997 for the murder of three unnamed Jews committed as during his role as Police chief in [[Mir, Belarus|Mir]]. At this stage he was in the advanced stages of dementia was declared medically unfit. He died later that year.
