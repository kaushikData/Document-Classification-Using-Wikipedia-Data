      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3836">"AgroWeb Network" was established in 1998 by organizations and individuals involved in agricultural and rural development in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). AgroWeb Network is maintained by institutions and individuals operating in their respective countries. 

AgroWeb Network collaborates with the [[European System of Cooperative Research Networks in Agriculture]].

[[International Association of Agricultural Information Specialists]] (IAALD) and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations (FAO) are initiators of the AgroWeb Network. The AgroWeb Network has introduced national portals of CEE countries. National portals include country-specific information mainly linking agriculture-related institutions - ministries, libraries, information centres, universities, research centres, Non-governmental Organizations (NGO's), agro-marketing organizations, etc. - involved in the European Integration process.

AgroWeb Network seeks to fulfill two basic objectives:

a) Collection and dissemination of information about the agricultural sector.

b) Capacity building and inter-institutional cooperation.

AgroWeb Network has twenty seven member countries. The national portals are hosted by the host organizations with support of national authorities and experts. The portals are maintained by national working groups composed of coordinators and authors/editors. The profiles of information management experts, national coordinators and AgroWeb authors/editors are included in the 'Contact Database'.&lt;ref&gt;"Contact Database" http://www.agrowebcee.net/contacts-database/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights''' is one of the four Committees of the [[United Cities and Local Governments]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=United Cities and Local Governments: Consultation mechanisms and Policy Councils |url=https://www.uclg.org/en/policy-councils#committees |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As an autonomous network in the framework of UCLG&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=United Nations Advisory Committee of Local Authorities (UNACLA) |url=https://unhabitat.org/unacla/ |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, its stated goal is to bring together local authorities from across the world to exchange points of view and local initiatives on social inclusion, participatory democracy and human rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights |url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/committee/our-mission |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Inheritor of the forums of local authorities (FAL) held in parallel to the first editions of the [[World Social Forum]], the Committee has become a relevant stakeholder in global advocacy for [[Human Rights City|human rights in the city]] and the [[right to the city|Right to the City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights: Background |url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/committee/strategic-plan/background |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its history, the Committee been characterized by facilitating meetings and networking between progressive local authorities, with a special emphasis in the Latin American and European region. Headquartered in Barcelona, the Committee is composed by more than 100 local governments and various partner organizations (among which, the [[Global Platform for the Right to the City]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights: Structure and members |url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/committee/structure/presidency}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==

The origins of the Committee lie in the first Local Authorities Forum for Social Inclusion and Participatory Democracy (FAL), a forum for reflection and political discussion made up by progressive local authorities from all over the world, an event which has been held at the same time as the World Social Forum since 2001. In 2005, a year after the creation of the new international organisation of local governments - United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) - the towns of the FAL decided to establish a more institutionalised working structure within a new organisation. This led to the creation of the Committee on Social Inclusion and Participatory Democracy (CSIPD).

Since its beginnings, the CSIPD has been present at the various FAL events (Caracas, 2005 ; Nairobi, 2007 and Belém do Pará, 2009; Dakar, 2011) and has maintained an ongoing dialogue with international social movements and civil society in the international social forums held in those cities. It has thus become the communication channel between the political debates held in these events and UCLG, and has undertaken its own political initiatives based mainly on two areas: social inclusion and participatory democracy. A third area, human rights, was added to the Committee's work soon afterwards, and was extensively developed with the production of two documents, the Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City (formally adopted by the Florence UCLG World Council in 2011) and the European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City (Saint-Denis, 2000). As a result, five years after it was established, the Committee on Social Inclusion and Participative Democracy has renamed itself as follows: Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights.

==Organisation==

The Committee consists of:

* local governments (individual cities or associations of local governments);
* local government networks;
* partners (universities and civil society organisations).

Becoming a member of the Committee is free and must be arranged through UCLG’s World Secretariat and the Committee's Executive Technical Secretariat. The Committee aims to ensure balanced geographic representation, and those members not belonging to UCLG will be encouraged to adhere to the organisation.

==Government Structure and Tasks==

The 102 Committee members are the plenary body, which is responsible for defining the general political directives of the Committee. 

Specification and implementation of the political directives will be the responsibility of the Committee’s bureau, which consists of a President, First Vice-president and several Regional Vice-presidents. The Committee will ensure balanced political representation in its bureau. We propose the following governing body for the period 2011 – 2013:

President: Barcelona (Spain)
First Vice-president: Saint-Denis / Plaine Commune (France)
Regional Vice-presidents:
Africa: Passy (Senegal)
Latin America: Guarulhos (Brazil) and Montevideo (Uruguay)
Asia: Federation of Municipalities of Sri Lanka (Sri Lanka)
Europe: Aubagne, Nantes (France) and FAMSI (Spain)


The President of the Committee is its leading political representative. The First Vice-president will be in charge of the institutional relations of the Committee in general, and will particularly participate at UCLG statutory meetings on behalf of the Committee. The regional vice-presidents will contribute to expanding the work of the Committee in their respective territorial areas and will represent it on a collegiate basis. The members of the bureau will ensure the financing of the Committee. 

Working groups can be created based around the Committee's three areas of work (social inclusion, participatory democracy and human rights) in order to contribute to the development of each one of these areas, and they will support the bureau in the definition and execution of the working plan. Each working group will be chaired by a bureau member. Nowadays the Committee has a working group on Local Economic Development, chaired and coordinated by the FAMSI (Andalucian Fund of Towns for International Solidarity). This group has its own Strategic Plan 2012-2013.

The Executive Technical Secretary will be responsible for co-ordinating the implementation of the working plan, fostering the 3 groups and organising and following up Committee meetings.

===Members===
List of members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/members/list]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==

The Committee meets once or twice a year in a plenary session to monitor the progress of its strategic objectives. Committee meetings will take place at the statutory meetings of UCLG (Executive Bureau, World Council or World Congress) or on the occasion of events organised by a city, international network or organisation with which the Committee collaborates. 

The political directives of the Committee will be specified in these meetings, and will be produced using participatory methodologies with decisions reached on the basis of consensus. Members that are unable to attend these meetings will be able to send their contributions in writing to the Executive Technical Secretary, who will be responsible for presenting them at the meeting and duly informing of the decisions taken.

The Committee's working groups can also convene sectorial meetings, the proposals of which will be notified to the bureau by the Executive Technical Secretary for assessment.

The working languages of the Committee are Spanish, English and French.

==Right to the City==

The 1990s was a milestone in terms of recognition of the role of local governments as pillars of states' democratic quality. Some years later, recognition of cities as key players in the guarantee of human rights in their role of providers of public services and agents responsible for education, health and housing policies would gain ground. This international debate would be translated in the claim for "the right to the city", according to which the city is a collective space which belongs to all its residents and which must offer the necessary conditions for a decent life from a social, political, cultural, economic and environmental point of view. As a result of this process, various local human rights charters were adopted from 2000 onwards:

* the European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City (Saint-Denis, 2000), signed by more than 350 European cities;
* the World Charter on the Right to the City, drafted by social movements gathered in the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre (2001);
* the Charter of Rights and Responsibilities of Montreal (2006);
* the Mexico City Charter for the Right to the City (2010).
* the Gwangju Human Rights Charter (South Korea, 2012).

The "right to a solidarity-based metropolis" would emerge afterwards intensively and is now being conceptualized.

In order to contribute to the international promotion of the right to the city, the UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights has drafted the Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City, an initiative that emerged from the Local Authorities Forum (FAL) for Social Inclusion and Participatory Democracy that took place in Caracas in 2006. Based on the discussions between local governments from around the world that took place in this Forum, a group of experts from various countries wrote a first draft (2007-2008),which was then discussed and amended by elected representatives, experts and representatives of civil society from all over the world (2009-2010).

Under the leadership initially of Barcelona Provincial Council and subsequently of the city of Nantes and the Pays de la Loire Region, the Global Charter-Agenda has been collectively discussed at several international events, including the last three FALs and World Social Forums (Nairobi, 2007; Belém do Pará, 2009; and Dakar, 2011), the I and II Peripheral Local Authorities Forum (Nanterre, 2006; Getafe, 2010), the 5th World Urban Forum of UN HABITAT (Rio de Janeiro, 2010), the 4th World Forum on Human Rights in Nantes (2010) and the 3rd UCLG World Congress (Mexico City, 2010). Research centers such as the Catalonia Institute for Human Rights (IDHC) and the Social Studies Centre (CES) of Coimbra University have also been involved in this process from the very beginning.

The added value of the Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City is that each human right featured in the document is accompanied by an action plan that serves as reference for concrete steps to undertake by local governments. Signatory cities are invited to set up a local agenda with deadlines and indicators in order to assess their efficiency in implementing these rights. The Charter-Agenda will come into effect in each city after a consultation and participation process allowing residents to discuss it and adapt it both to local reality and to the national legal framework; and upon acceptance by a qualified majority of the municipal assembly. The result of this process will be the adoption of a Local Charter-Agenda in each signatory municipality.

In the current situation of economic crisis and a possible reduction in rights, the Charter-Agenda is a tool for local governments to build more inclusive, democratic and solidarity-based societies in dialogue with urban dwellers. At its meeting in Mexico City in November 2010, the UCLG Executive Bureau recommended the adoption of the Charter-Agenda to the World Council, which will meet in Florence, Italy on 11 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/right-to-the-city]&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City===

The European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City (Saint Denis, 2000) is the result of the preparatory work initiated in Barcelona in 1998 in the framework of the Conference "Cities for Human Rights", which was organised to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Hundreds of Mayors and political representatives participated in the event and united their voice to call for a stronger political acknowledgement as key actors in safeguarding human rights in a highly urbanised world.

Participating cities adopted the "Barcelona Engagement", consisting of a roadmap to draft a political document aimed at fostering the respect, protection and fulfilment of human rights at local level.

During the two proceeding years, the European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City was drafted as the result of a plural dialogue between European cities, civil society representatives and human rights experts. The draft was discussed and finally adopted in Saint-Denis in 2000.
Since then, a European conference is held every two years to share the progress made by signatory cities, more than 400 today, to implement the Charter. The following conferences have been organized to date:

* 1998, Barcelona (Spain)
* 2000, Saint-Denis (France)
* 2002, Venice (Italy)
* 2004, Nuremberg (Germany)
* 2006, Lyon (France)
* 2008, Geneva (Switzerland)
* 2010, Tuzla (Bosnia-Herzegovina)

After the conference in Geneva (2008), the most active cities in the network (Barcelona, Saint-Denis/Plaine Commune, Lyon, Geneva and Nantes) decided to entrust the promotion of the European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City to the world organization of cities, United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), through its Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights.

The Committee, initially under the political leadership of the Provincial Council of Barcelona (Spain) and subsequently the city of Nantes (France), was working since 2006 on the production of a municipal charter of human rights with a worldwide scope, the Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City. UCLG formally adopted this charter in 2011 at its World Council in Florence, which was attended by over 400 mayors from all over the world.

The main differences between the Charter-Agenda and the European Charter lie, on the one hand, in the different geographic scope of each document (one is global, while the other is European) and, on the other hand, in the agenda or local action plan that the Charter-Agenda contains. As a result, in the Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City each right is accompanied by an action plan that is a benchmark for use by local governments when taking concrete steps for human rights implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/right-to-the-city/european-charter]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City===

* the Charter of Rights and Responsibilities of Montreal (Canada, 2006);
* the Mexico City Charter for the Right to the City (Mexico, 2010);
* the Gwangju Human Rights Charter (South Korea, 2012).

The concept of the "right to a solidarity-based metropolis" would emerge afterwards intensively in the framework of the Forum of Peripheral Local Authorities (FALP) and is now being developed.

Drafting Process of the Charter-Agenda:
In order to contribute to the international promotion of the right to the city, the UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights drafted the Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City, an initiative that emerged from the Local Authorities Forum for Social Inclusion and Participatory Democracy (FAL) that took place in Caracas in 2006.

Under the leadership initially of Barcelona Provincial Council (Diputació de Barcelona) and subsequently of the city of Nantes and the Pays de la Loire Region, the Global Charter-Agenda has been collectively discussed at several international events, including the last three FALs and World Social Forums (Nairobi, 2007; Belém do Pará, 2009; and Dakar, 2011), the I  and II FALPs (Nanterre, 2006; Getafe, 2010), the 5th World Urban Forum of UN HABITAT (Rio de Janeiro, 2010), the 4th World Forum on Human Rights in Nantes (2010) and the 3rd UCLG World Congress (Mexico City, 2010). Research centers such as the Catalonia Institute for Human Rights (IDHC) and the Social Studies Centre (CES) of Coimbra University have also been involved in this process from the very beginning.

The added value of the Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City is that each human right featured in the document is accompanied by an action plan that serves as reference for concrete steps to undertake by local governments. Signatory cities are invited to set up a local agenda with deadlines and indicators in order to assess their efficiency in implementing these rights. The Charter-Agenda will come into effect in each city after a consultation and participation process allowing residents to discuss it and adapt it both to local reality and to the national legal framework; and upon acceptance by a qualified majority of the municipal assembly. The result of this process will be the adoption of a Local Charter-Agenda in each signatory municipality.

The World Council of UCLG held in Florence in December 2011 formally adopted the Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City and invited all UCLG members to sign it. In the current situation of economic crisis and a possible reduction in rights, the Charter-Agenda is a tool for local governments to build more inclusive, democratic and solidarity-based societies in dialogue with urban dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/right-to-the-city/world-charter-agenda]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inclusive Cities Observatory==

The Observatory is a space for analysis and reflection on local social inclusion policies. It contains over sixty case studies on innovative policies for community development, access to basic services, gender equality, environmental protection and the eradication of poverty, among others.

The initiative has been developed with the scientific support of Prof. Yves Cabannes from the University College of London and a team of researchers from the Centre for Social Studies (CES) at the University of Coimbra, which has worked under the supervision of Prof. Boaventura de Sousa Santos.

Through this Observatory, the Committee has identified and researched successful experiences that might inspire other cities to design and implement their own social inclusion policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/observatory]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Study on participatory democracy and social inclusion===

The policies included in the Inclusive Cities Observatory have been the basis for the production of a study on the impact of citizen participation on social inclusion policies. This study has been produced by the IGOP (Institute of Government and Public Policy) of the Autonomous University of Barcelona (Spain).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/observatory/reports/study-participatory-democracy-and-social-inclusion]&lt;/ref&gt;

===For a World of Inclusive Cities===

The publication that we present contains the policy paper on local social inclusion promoted by the Committee on Social Inclusion, Participative Democracy and Human Rights of United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG). This paper presents the main policy guidelines that cities are recommended to follow when designing and developing public policies for social inclusion. Along the same lines, its objective is to help the position of UCLG on this matter and direct its discourse toward other international agencies and organizations.

This document was approved by the UCLG World Council, which took place between 27 and 30 November 2008 in Istanbul. It draws on the findings of the "1st International Seminar on Innovative Local Policies for Social Inclusion", held in Barcelona on 27 and 28 September 2007, as well as the political discussions that took place within UCLG, through its regional sections and working committees.

The "1st International Seminar on Innovative Local Policies for Social Inclusion" was organized by Barcelona City Council and the Committee on Social Inclusion, with the support of the Catalan Government and the scientific advice of the DPU (Development Planning Unit), University College London. The seminar was attended by representatives of Eldoret (Kenya), Rosario (Argentina), Diyarbakir (Turkey), London (United Kingdom), Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre (Brazil), Palmela (Portugal), Tacoma (United States), Cotacachi (Ecuador), Barcelona (Spain), Saint-Denis (France) and Bandung (Indonesia). Representatives of these 12 cities, all from very different realities, reported on their various policies of inclusion, while faced with the task of reflecting and deliberating together on three topics: (i) ensuring social justice and rights; (ii) citizen participation and generation of social networks; (iii) planning and sustainability policies.

The Committee on Social Inclusion, Participative Democracy and Human Rights of UCLG is especially grateful for the key contributions made to the draft of this paper by the Centre for Social Studies at the University of Coimbra, the European Observatory Cities and Towns for All; the cities of Cordoba, Barcelona, Terrassa (Spain), Ecatepec de Morelos (México), Guarulhos (Brazil), Villa El Salvador (Peru), Nanterre, Saint-Denis, Plaine Commune (France), Junín (Argentina), Cotacachi (Ecuador) and Eldoret (Kenya); Malaga Provincial Council (Spain) and the Province of Milan (Italy); the Andalusia cooperation fund FAMSI (Spain), the Forum of Local Authorities (FAL) and the Forum of Peripheral Local Authorities (FALP); the UCLG committees on Peripheral Cities, City Diplomacy, Urban Mobility and Urban Strategic Planning; and UCLG World Secretariat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/observatory/reports/world-inclusive-cities]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''conditional sale''' is a [[real estate]] transaction where the parties have set conditions. 

A standard real estate transaction usually begins when a prospective [[buyer|purchaser]] submits an offer to purchase to the [[seller|vendor]] of a property. As in a standard offer, a conditional offer sets out the terms of the sale such as the purchase price, the date of closing, the names of the parties, and the amount of any required deposit, but it also stipulates various conditions which must be met in order for the contract to be binding on the parties. These conditions may include approval by a co-purchaser, [[Mortgage loan|financing]] acceptable to the purchaser, the receipt and review of a [[Surveying|survey]] showing that the buildings on the property comply with local zoning regulations, a title search showing no unacceptable [[lien]]s or [[encumbrance]]s, confirmation from the current mortgagee that the property is not in [[foreclosure]], and the like. If the offer is accepted by the vendor, the offer to purchase will become a contract binding on the parties when all conditions are satisfied.

An alternative to a conditional sale is an [[invitation to treat]]. Unlike a conditional sale, an invitation to treat does not become binding upon satisfaction of any conditions. Issues arise as to the distinction between actions which constitute an offer or an invitation to treat, especially when the intentions of the parties are not clearly specified at the time.

== History ==
The role was once widespread with many counties, cities and other local authorities employing their own architect to design [[public works]].  Council architects acted as designer, client and regulator for their authority, and having significant buying power, they were able to influence suppliers to accommodate their requirements.  They worked closely with the council planning department, with whom they were often co-located.&lt;ref name=house&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lang|first1=Ruth|title=In-house: the council architect|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/buildings/in-house-the-council-architect/10016166.article|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=Architects' Journal|date=17 January 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081510/https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/buildings/in-house-the-council-architect/10016166.article|archivedate=16 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1953, the [[London County Council]] (LCC) employed more than 1,500 people within its architects department.&lt;ref name=stats&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waite|first1=Richard|last2=MacKinnon|first2=Ella|title=Which councils employ the most in-house architects?|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/which-councils-employ-the-most-in-house-architects/8691324.article|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=Architects' Journal|date=2 November 2015|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081436/https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/which-councils-employ-the-most-in-house-architects/8691324.article|archivedate=16 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LCC architects were key innovators, with the guaranteed salary and relative anonymity allowing them to develop experimental designs without risk to income or the stigma of failure.  The LCC architects department also provided research funding, including for the [[Survey of London]], and had in-house testing and development teams.  The smaller scale firms in private practice at the time could not provide such luxuries.&lt;ref name=house/&gt;

==Current role==
The trend in recent decades has been for councils to close their architects departments.&lt;ref name=croydon&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marrs|first1=Colin|title=Croydon creates first in-house architects department in years|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/croydon-creates-first-in-house-architects-department-in-years/8691149.article|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=Architects' Journal|date=28 October 2015|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081557/https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/croydon-creates-first-in-house-architects-department-in-years/8691149.article|archivedate=16 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2015 there were 237 council architects in England, 159 in Scotland and 24 in Wales.  The biggest employers are Hampshire (44), Glasgow (18), the [[Highland Council]] (13) and Lancashire (11). Despite their predecessors having one of the largest and most active architects departments in the country, no London borough now employs more than five council architects.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt;

Once closed, a local authority is highly unlikely to revive an architects department and will instead rely on outsourcing to private firms.  One exception is the London Borough of Croydon, which re-established a council architect position in 2015.&lt;ref name=croydon/&gt;  [[Hampshire County Architects]] remains the largest council architects department,&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; and is recognized as a leader in its field, winning several awards for its school designs since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=house/&gt;

[[File:Daniel Itzig.jpeg|thumb|Daniel Itzig.]]

'''Daniel Itzig''' (also known as '''Daniel Yoffe''' 18 March 1723 in Berlin – 17 May 1799 in [[Potsdam]]) was a [[Court Jew]] of Kings [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II the Great]] and [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]] of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].

==Biography==
[[File:Itzig Daniel Medal 1793.JPG|thumb|left|Medal posted for Daniel Itzig's 70th birthday in 1793]]

Itzig was born in Berlin. His [[Itzig family|family]] was mercantile. Itzig was a banker and a mintmaster in partnership with [[Veitel-Heine Ephraim]]. Together they leased all the [[Mint (coin)|mint]]s in Saxony and Prussia. During the [[Seven Years' War]] they assisted Frederick the Great in debasing the Saxonian currency&lt;ref&gt;Conway (2012) 145.&lt;/ref&gt; and spreading the [[Ephraimites]], not only in Saxony, but also in [[Silesia]], Poland, Bohemia and [[Courland]]. 

Itzig was one of the very few Jews in Prussia to receive full citizenship privileges, as a "Useful Jew". He became extraordinarily wealthy as a consequence.

[[File:Romanelli Masa Baarav.jpg|300px-Romanelli_Masa_Baarav.jpg|thumb|Book by Romineli commemorating Itzig in Berlin]]

Together with his son in law [[David Friedlander]], Itzig was appointed to lead a committee which was to discuss ways to improve the  Jewish civil and social standing in Prussia, which led to the removal of many restrictions. He funded early members of the [[Haskalah]] secular movement, including Rabbi [[Israel of Zamosch]] ([[Moses Mendelsohn]]'s teacher), Samuel Rominow (an Italian Jewish artist) and [[Isaac Satanow]].&lt;ref&gt;Masa BaArav, (Hebrew), Samuel Romanelli, Berlin 1781&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1761 he began planning a school for poor Jewish boys in Berlin, and in 1778 his son together with Daniel Friedlander opened the first "free school" (Freischule) called "Hinuch Neorim", Hebrew for 'Teaching the Young Ones'. The school and adjacent printing house later became one of the main institutions of the Haskalah movement. At the same time he founded and funded a [[Yeshiva]] and brought Rabbi [[Hirschel Levin]] and Rabbi [[Joseph ben Meir Teomim]] to Berlin to teach there.

Itzig was the official head ('Oberältester') of the Jewish community in Berlin from 1764 until his death in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;Conway (2012) 145.&lt;/ref&gt; He was made the Prussian court banker by Frederick's successor, [[Frederick William II of Prussia]] in 1797.

==Legacy==
His wife Miriam Wulff's ancestors included Rabbi [[Moses Isserles]] of [[Cracow]] and [[Joseph ben Mordechai Gershon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=376&amp;letter=I#1084 Daniel Itzig] in the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] (1901–1904)&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Itzig's thirteen children (see [[Itzig family]])  became influential in German Jewish society. Two of his granddaughters married two of [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s sons. One of them was Lea (née Solomon), mother of [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Fanny Mendelssohn|Fanny Hensel]], a pianist and composer. By her, Lea was grandmother of mathematician [[Kurt Hensel]].

'''''Deutsche Mathematik''''' (German Mathematics) was a mathematics journal founded in 1936 by [[Ludwig Bieberbach]] and [[Theodor Vahlen]]. Vahlen was publisher on behalf of the [[German Research Foundation]] (DFG), and Bieberbach was chief editor. Other editors were {{Interlanguage link multi|Fritz Kubach|de}}, [[Erich Schönhardt]], [[Werner Weber (mathematician)|Werner Weber]] (all volumes), [[Ernst August Wei&amp;szlig;]] (volumes 1–6), {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl Dörge|de}}, [[Wilhelm Süss]] (volumes 1–5), [[Günther Schulz (mathematician)|Günther Schulz]] &lt;small&gt;([[:de:Günther Schulz (Mathematiker)|de]])&lt;/small&gt;, {{Interlanguage link multi|Erhard Tornier|de}} (volumes 1–4), [[Georg Feigl]], [[Gerhard Kowalewski]] (volumes 2–6), {{Interlanguage link multi|Maximilian Krafft|de}}, [[Willi Rinow]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Max Zacharias|de}} (volumes 2–5), and [[Oswald Teichmüller]] (volumes 3–7).&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:Category:Deutsche Mathematik (journal)|Volume tables of contents]]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1936, the journal was declared the official organ of the [[German Student Union]] (DSt) by its ''Reichsf&amp;uuml;hrer'', and all local DSt mathematics departments were requested to subscribe and actively contribute.&lt;ref&gt;Vol.1, issue 2, p.122-123, Communication of the DSt's ''Reichsfachabteilung'' mathematics by Fritz Kubach&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s, issues appeared increasingly delayed and bunched; the journal ended with a triple issue (due Dec 1942) in June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.ub.tu-berlin.de/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=TUB&amp;docId=tub_aleph001828958&amp;fn=permalink Record] at [[Technical University Berlin]] library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Issue list of volume [[:File:DeuMath1936 6.jpg|1]], [[:File:DeuMath1937 6.jpg|2]], [[:File:DeuMath1938 6.jpg|3]], [[:File:DeuMath1939 5.jpg|4]], [[:File:DeuMath1940 5.jpg|5]], [[:File:DeuMath1941 5.jpg|6]], [[:File:DeuMath1942 6.jpg|7]] at commons&lt;/ref&gt;
 
'''''Deutsche Mathematik''''' is also the name of a movement closely associated with the journal whose aim was to promote "German mathematics" and eliminate "Jewish influence" in mathematics, similar to the [[Deutsche Physik]] movement. As well as articles on mathematics, the journal published propaganda articles giving the Nazi viewpoint on the relation between mathematics and race (though these political articles mostly disappeared after the first two volumes). As a result of this many mathematics libraries outside Germany did not subscribe to it, so copies of the journal can be hard to find. This caused some problems in [[Teichmüller theory]], as [[Oswald Teichmüller]] published several of his foundational papers in the journal.

{{Contract law}}
An '''escape clause''' is any clause, term, or condition in a [[contract]] that allows a party to that contract to avoid having to perform the contract.

If an [[Contract|agreement]] was drawn up for the sale of a [[house]], for example, the purchaser could include some kind of escape clause in the contract, which will allow him to "escape" from the contract without being liable for [[breach of contract]].&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bruss|first1=Robert J.|title=Escape Clause Vital to Avoiding Problems When Buying Home|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-12-10/realestate/re-299_1_escape-clause|accessdate=12 December 2017|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=10 December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real estate escape clauses==
A "Subject to a builder's inspection to purchaser's full satisfaction" clause is one example of an escape clause. This clause effectively allows the [[buyer|purchaser]] to "escape" from the contract if an inspection reveals any irregularities or defects.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chitrib"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bruss|first1=Robert|title=Home Sellers, Be Aware Of Escape Clauses|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-09-05/news/8703070854_1_contingency-clause-professional-inspection-mortgage-contingency|accessdate=12 December 2017|agency=Chicago Tribune|date=5 September 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the "Subject to 30-day due diligence" clause, which effectively gives the purchaser a 30-day buffer period to inspect any and all aspects of the property before having to commit to the [[Sales|purchase]].

A [[72-hour clause]] is an example of a seller's escape clause that frequently appears in [[real estate]] contracts.

The finance contingency clause: Makes the purchase offer contingent upon the buyer and also the property qualifying for the loan the buyer will need.

==Escape clause abuse==
Escape clauses, although fulfilling a real and sincere purpose in contracts of all kinds, have the potential of being abused.&lt;ref name="chitrib"/&gt;

For example, the "Subject to a builder's inspection to purchaser's full satisfaction" clause mentioned above can be abused if the buyer contracts a builder and instructs him to find some kind of fault in the property at any cost.

The buyer, in other words, takes advantage of the escape clause to cancel the agreement because he has [[Buyer's remorse|buyer remorse]], rather than because there is something wrong with the property.

==Escape clause validity==
Escape clauses that require a purchaser or an expert representing the purchaser to be satisfied with the goods or services being purchased have been attacked in [[lawsuit]]s as invalid for lack of [[consideration]]. The argument is that a party can always escape such a contract by merely claiming to be unsatisfied. Therefore, there is no real requirement for that party to perform their obligations under the contract (to pay for the goods or services), and an agreement that only requires performance by one party is an [[illusory promise]], void as a contract. Instead, such an agreement constitutes a gift from the performing party to the non-performing party.

Courts have generally held, however, that an escape clause containing a requirement of satisfaction nevertheless creates an enforceable contract, because a court could determine whether a claimed lack of satisfaction was entirely unreasonable, and therefore likely feigned to avoid the contract.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4956">{{Policy Debate}}
'''Evidence''' in a [[policy debate]] competition (sometimes referred to as "cards") consists mainly of two parts.  The ''cite'' contains all relevant citation information (that is, the author, date of publication, journal, title, etc.).  Although every card should contain a complete citation, only the author's name and date of publication are typically spoken aloud in a speech.  Some teams will also read the author's qualifications if they wish to emphasize this information.  The ''body'' is a fragment of the author's original text.  The length of a body can vary greatly&amp;mdash;cards can be as short as a few sentences and as long as two or more pages.  Most cards are between one and five paragraphs in length.  The body of a card is often underlined or highlighted in order to eliminate unnecessary or redundant sentences when the card is read in a round.  In a round, the tagline, the debater's summary of the evidence, is read first, followed by the cite and the body.

As pieces of evidence accumulate use, multiple colors of highlighting and different thicknesses of underlining often accrue, sometimes making it difficult to determine which portion of the evidence was read. If debaters stop before finishing the underlined or highlighted portion of a card, it is considered good form to "mark" the card to show where one stopped reading.  To otherwise misrepresent how much of a card was read&amp;mdash;either by stopping early or by skipping underlined or highlighted sections&amp;mdash;is known as "cross-reading" or "clipping cards", which is generally considered cheating. Although many judges overtly condemn the practice on their paradigms, it is hard to enforce, especially if judges permit debaters to be excessively unclear. Opponents will generally stand behind a debater whom they believe to be "cross-reading" though this practice does not necessarily mean they believe the debater is doing so, as if waiting to take a card (see below), and silently read along with them in an attempt to get their opponent to stop or the judge to notice.

As cards are read in round, it is common for an opponent to collect and examine even while a speech is still going on. This practice originated in part because cards are read at a rate much faster than conversational speed but also because the non-underlined portion of cards is not read in round. Taking the cards during the speech allows the opponent to question the author's qualifications, the original context of the evidence, etc. in [[cross-examination]].  It is generally accepted whichever team is using preparation time has priority to read evidence read previously during a round by both teams.  As a result, large amounts of evidence may change hands after the use of preparation time but before a speech.  Most judges will not deduct from a team's preparation time for time spent finding evidence which the other team has misplaced.

After a round, judges often "call for cards" to examine evidence whose merit was contested during the round or whose weight was emphasized during rebuttals so that they can read the evidence for themselves.  Although widespread, this practice is explicitly banned at some tournaments, most notably [[National Catholic Forensic League]] nationals and some judges refuse to call for cards because they believe the practice constitutes "doing work for debaters that should have been done during round".  Judges may also call for evidence for the purpose of obtaining its citation information so that they can produce the evidence for their own school.  Opponents and spectators are also generally allowed to collect citations in this manner and some tournaments send scouts to rounds to facilitate the collection of cites for every team at the tournament, information which is sometimes published online.

Many teams may use other media to present "evidence" such as music, pictures, poetry, dance, etc. Using other media to present evidence is considered a performance argument and the team may defend or claim advantages from the presentation itself and not only the substance.

{{Politics of Laos}}
The situation of '''[[human rights]] in [[Laos]]''' has often been, and remains, a recognized cause for serious concern. Laos is one a handful of [[Marxist-Leninist]] governments and is ruled by a one-party [[communist]] government backed by the [[Lao People's Army]] in alliance with the [[Vietnam People's Army]] and Socialist Republic of [[Vietnam]] in [[Hanoi]].

[[Amnesty International]], [[The Centre for Public Policy Analysis]], the [[United League for Democracy in Laos]], [[Human Rights Watch]], the [[Lao Human Rights Council]] and other non-governmental organizations (NGO)s have raised repeated serious concerns about the ratification record of the Laos Government on human rights standards and its lack of cooperation with the UN human rights mechanisms and legislative measures which impact negatively on human rights. They have also raised concerns in relation to disappeared civic activist [[Sombath Somphone]], and jailed and [[tortured]] political and religious [[dissidents]], military attacks on unarmed civilians, as well as the lack of freedom of expression, torture, poor prison conditions, restrictions on freedom of religions, protection of refugees and asylum-seekers, [[extrajudicial killing]] and [[rape]] by the [[Lao People's Army]] and security forces and the improper use of the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa26/003/2009/en/|author=Amnesty International|date=May 2010|title=Submission to the UN Universal Periodic Review: Eighth session of the UPR Working Group of the Human Rights Council|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy objectives of both the Lao [[communist]] government and international donors remain focused toward achieving sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbank.org/lao World Bank: Lao PDR]&lt;/ref&gt; but restrictions on [[freedom of expression]] and association are a source of concern.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070612180855/http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/Regions/Asia-Pacific/Laos Amnesty International Report 2008, Lao PDR]&lt;/ref&gt; The barring of independent human rights monitors makes an exact appraisal of the situation impossible.  In particular, the situation for groups of ethnic [[Hmong people|Hmong]] hiding in the jungle remains grave and leads to a steady stream of people taking refuge in neighboring [[Thailand]].  The [[death penalty]] remains in force, although no executions have been reported since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA26/001/2008/en|title=Document - Amnesty International|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[State Department]] reports on [[human rights]] around the world declare that most Lao trials in 2003 were little more than pro forma examinations of the accused, with a verdict having already been reached. The State Department indicated that in some instances police administratively overruled court decisions, at times detaining a defendant exonerated by the court, in violation of the law. Moreover, while Lao law prohibits [[torture]], members of the security forces reportedly subjected prisoners to torture and other abuses. A significant issue in human rights in Laos is the presence of anti-government [[rebellion|rebels]], mainly of the [[Hmong people|Hmong]] [[ethnic minority]], who have reportedly been harshly treated by the Lao government. In its 2006 report the [[State Department]] mentions that "The government's overall human rights record worsened during the year."  For more details see the report (link given below under "see also").

== Official Lao position on human rights ==
Officially, and in theory, the Constitution that was [[promulgated]] in 1991 under the [[Stalin]]ist government contains most key safeguards for human rights. For example, in Article 8 it makes it clear that Laos is a [[multiethnic]] state and is committed to equality between ethnic groups. The Constitution also has provisions for [[gender equality]] and [[freedom of religion]], for [[freedom of speech]], press and assembly.&lt;ref&gt;In reality, however, these rights, are almost never afforded to ordinary citizens in Laos, or political or religious dissidents, or the ethnic Hmong minority, and there is no [[independent judiciary]] in Laos under the current government.  Judges are appointed by the intelligence services, [[Lao People's Army]] and the one-party [[communist]] government.[http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/laos.pdf Constitution of the Lao PDR]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2009, Laos ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, nine years after signing the treaty. The policy objectives of both the Lao government and international donors remain focused toward achieving sustainable economic growth and [[poverty reduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/lao |title=Lao PDR |publisher=World Bank |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/laos.pdf |title=Constitution of the Lao PDR |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, systemic corruption, and [[illegal logging]] also remains a serious problem among Lao government and military officials according to [[Transparency International]] and others.

However, according to [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[the Center for Public Policy Analysis]], the [[United League for Democracy in Laos]], the [[Lao Human Rights Council]], the [[Lao Veterans of America Institute]], and many human rights organizations, non-governmental organizations, and policy experts, the reality in Laos is quite different, and the [[Marxist]] government generally does not abide by its own Constitution. The Lao government in [[Vientiane]] has been frequently condemned by the [[US Congress]], [[United Nations]] Committee on Racial Discrimination, [[European Parliament]] and human rights advocates, especially in light of the imprisonment of pro-democracy Lao student leaders in October 1999, the persecution of Hmong [[refugees]] and asylum seekers and the recent abduction and disappearance of civil society leader [[Sombath Somphone]].{{cn|date=November 2017}}

The Lao government maintains very close relations with the government of [[North Korea]] and its military.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

==Death penalty==
{{main|Capital punishment in Laos}}
Between 2003 and 2009, at least 39 people were sentenced to death. 50 more people were sentenced to death in the year 2010.

==Individual cases==

There are many individual cases of human rights violations in Laos according to NGOs and [[human rights]] advocates.

For example, two former high-ranking government officials whose imprisonment for expressing [[dissident]] political views had been much publicized by international human rights groups were released in October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/humanrights/Latsami_Khamphoui_Released.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908003851/http://www7.nationalacademies.org/humanrights/Latsami_Khamphoui_Released.html |archive-date=2008-09-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A third dissident sentenced along with them died in prison in 1998. The three men had been arrested in 1990 for expressing concern about government policies and advocating economic and political reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=4836&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=UNESCO - UNESCO appeals for release  of Laotian policial prisoner Latsami Khamphoui|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1999, 30 young people were arrested for attempting to display posters calling for peaceful economic, political and social change in Laos. Five of them were arrested and subsequently sentenced to up to 10 years imprisonment on charges of treason. One has since died due to his treatment by prison guards, while one has been released. The surviving three men should have been released by October 2009, but their whereabouts remains unknown.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"/&gt;

In 2004, a Lao Hmong refugee photographed and then smuggled video footage out of Laos of an alleged incident in which Lao government troops [[rape]]d and [[murder]]ed four young Hmong girls and one boy, then mutilated their bodies [http://www.rfa.org/english/news/social/2004/10/06/laos_massacre/index.html].
He denies claims by the Lao government that the video was a fabrication.

==Hmong conflict and attacks on unarmed Hmong civilians==
The government of Laos has been accused of committing genocide against that country’s Hmong ethnic minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unpo.org/article/5095| author=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization| accessdate=20 April 2011|title=WGIP: Side event on the Hmong Lao, at the United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hmong groups fought as CIA-backed units on the Royalist side in the Laos civil war. After the Pathet Lao took over the country in 1975, the conflict continued in isolated pockets. In 1977 a communist newspaper promised the party would hunt down the “American collaborators” and their families “to the last root”.

As many as 200,000 Hmong went into exile in Thailand, with many ending up in the U.S. A number of Hmong fighters hid out in mountains in [[Xiangkhouang Province]] for many years, with a remnant emerging from the jungle in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article690367.ece| author=The Times|date=30 July 2006|title=No way out|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laos and Vietnamese troops were reported to have raped and killed four Christian Hmong women in [[Xiangkhouang Province|Xieng Khouang]] province in 2011, according to US NGO [[The Centre for Public Policy Analysis]]. CPPA also said other Christian and independent Buddhist and [[animist]] believers were being persecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/laos-vietnam-troops-kill-hmong-christians/story-e6freuyi-1226040033388|author=The Telegraph|date=16 April 2011|title=Laos, Vietnam troops kill Hmong Christians}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/SEAsia/Story/STIStory_657442.html|author=The straits Times|date=16 April 2011|title=Laos, Vietnam troops kill four Hmong Christians: NGO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International and other NGOs, journalists and [[human rights]] advocates have documented the [[Lao People's Army]]'s attacks on unarmed Hmong civilians in Laos.

===Hmong refugees and forced repatriation===

In 1989, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR), with the support of the United States government, instituted the [[Comprehensive Plan of Action]], a program to stem the tide of [[boat people|Indochinese refugees]] from Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Under the plan, the status of the refugees was to be evaluated through a screening process. Recognized asylum seekers were to be given resettlement opportunities, while the remaining refugees were to be repatriated under guarantee of safety.

After talks with the UNHCR and the Thai government, Laos agreed to repatriate the 60,000 Lao refugees living in Thailand, including several thousand Hmong people. Very few of the Lao refugees, however, were willing to return voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;"Laos agrees to voluntary repatriation of refugees in Thailand," U.P.I., June 5, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure to resettle the refugees grew as the Thai government worked to close its remaining refugee camps. While some Hmong people returned to Laos voluntarily, with development assistance from UNHCR, allegations of forced repatriation surfaced.&lt;ref&gt;"Lao Refugees Return Home Under European Union Repatriation Program," Associated Press Worldstream, 22 11, 1994. Karen J, "HOUSE PANEL HEARS CONCERNS ABOUT HMONG," States News Service, April 26, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Of those Hmong who did return to Laos, some quickly escaped back to Thailand, describing discrimination and brutal treatment at the hands of Lao authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton-Merritt, Jane. Tragic Mountains. p. xix–xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Vue Mai, a former Hmong soldier who had been recruited by the U.S. Embassy in [[Bangkok]] to return to Laos as proof of the repatriation program's success, disappeared in [[Vientiane]]. According to the U.S. Committee for Refugees, he was arrested by Lao security forces and was never seen again.

Following the Vue Mai incident, debate over the Hmong's planned repatriation to Laos intensified greatly, especially in the U.S., where it drew strong opposition from many [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]] and some [[human rights]] advocates.  In an October 23, 1995 ''[[National Review]]'' article, [[Michael Johns (policy analyst)|Michael Johns]], the former [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]] foreign policy expert and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[White House]] aide, labeled the Hmong's repatriation a [[Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] "betrayal," describing the Hmong as a people "who have spilled their blood in defense of American geopolitical interests."&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;[https://archive.is/20070705214752/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n20_v47/ai_17443642 "Acts of Betrayal: Persecution of Hmong", by Michael Johns, ''National Review'', October 23, 1995.]&lt;/ref&gt; Debate on the issue escalated quickly.  In an effort to halt the planned repatriation, the Republican-led [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] both appropriated funds for the remaining Thailand-based Hmong to be immediately resettled in the U.S.; Clinton, however, responded by promising a veto of the legislation.

In their opposition of the repatriation plans, Republicans also challenged the Clinton administration's position that the Laotian government was not systematically violating Hmong human rights.  U.S. Representative [[Steve Gunderson (politician)|Steve Gunderson]] (R-WI), for instance, told a Hmong gathering: "I do not enjoy standing up and saying to my government that you are not telling the truth, but if that is necessary to defend truth and justice, I will do that."&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt; Republicans also called several Congressional hearings on alleged persecution of the Hmong in Laos in an apparent attempt to generate further support for their opposition to the Hmong's repatriation to Laos.

Although some accusations of forced repatriation were denied,&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=hb909nb5j8&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;doc.view=entire_text Reports on results of investigations of allegations concerning the welfare of Hmong refugees and asylum seekers in Thailand and Laos] Refugee and Migration Affairs Unit, United States Embassy (Thailand), 1992, Retrieved 2007-07-27&lt;/ref&gt; thousands of Hmong people refused to return to Laos. In 1996, as the deadline for the closure of Thai refugee camps approached, and under mounting political pressure, the U.S. agreed to resettle Hmong refugees who passed a new screening process.&lt;ref&gt;STEVE GUNDERSON, "STATE DEPARTMENT OUTLINES RESETTLEMENT GUIDELINES FOR HMONG REFUGEES," Congressional Press Releases, May 18, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 5,000 Hmong people who were not resettled at the time of the camp closures sought asylum at [[Wat Tham Krabok]], a Buddhist monastery in central Thailand where more than 10,000 Hmong refugees were already living. The Thai government attempted to repatriate these refugees, but the Wat Tham Krabok Hmong refused to leave and the Lao government refused to accept them, claiming they were involved in the [[illegal drug trade]] and were of non-Lao origin.&lt;ref&gt;"Laos refuses to take back Thai-based Hmong refugees," Deutsche Presse-Agentur, August 20, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, following threats of forcible removal by the Thai government, the U.S., in a significant victory for the Hmong, agreed to accept 15,000 of the refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090117073258/http://www.state.gov/g/prm/rls/fs/2004/28212.htm "Refugee Admissions Program for East Asia"] Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, January 16, 2004, archived January 17, 2009 from [https://www.state.gov/g/prm/rls/fs/2004/28212.htm the original]&lt;/ref&gt; Several thousand Hmong people, fearing forced repatriation to Laos if they were not accepted for resettlement in the U.S., fled the camp to live elsewhere within Thailand where a sizable Hmong population has been present since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centralcallegal.org/hrtf/history/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021133910/http://www.centralcallegal.org/hrtf/history/index.html|title=HMONG RESETTLEMENT TASK FORCE - HISTORY|archivedate=21 October 2008|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 and 2005, thousands of Hmong fled from the jungles of Laos to a temporary refugee camp in the Thai province of [[Phetchabun Province|Phetchabun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4724199.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hmong refugees pleading to stay | date=July 28, 2005 | accessdate=May 4, 2010 | first=Kylie | last=Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Hmong refugees, many of whom are descendants of the former-CIA Secret Army and their relatives, claim that they have been attacked by both the Lao and Vietnamese military forces operating inside Laos as recently as June 2006. The refugees claim that attacks against them have continued almost unabated since the war officially ended in 1975, and have become more intense in recent years.

Lending further support to earlier claims that the government of Laos was persecuting the Hmong, filmmaker Rebecca Sommer documented first-hand accounts in her documentary, ''Hunted Like Animals'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sommerfilms.org/documentaries/Hmong/index.php Hunted like animals] Rebecca Sommer Film Clips&lt;/ref&gt; and in a comprehensive report which includes summaries of claims made by the refugees and was submitted to the U.N. in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthpeoples.org/new/report-download/REPORT-Hmong-Rebecca_Sommer.pdf REPORT on the situation in the Xaysomboun Special Zone and 1100 Hmong-Lao refugees who escaped to Petchabun, Thailand during 2004-2005] Rebecca Sommer, May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

For the time being, countries willing to resettle the refugees are hindered to proceed with immigration and settlement procedures because the Thai administration does not grant them access to the refugees. Plans to resettle additional Hmong refugees in the U.S. have been complicated by provisions of President George W. Bush's [[Patriot Act]] and [[Real ID Act]], under which Hmong veterans of the Secret War, who fought on the side of the United States, are classified as terrorists because of their historical involvement in armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/nation/16736791.htm?source=rss&amp;channel=inquirer_nation {{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 27, 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the Thai military was preparing to forcibly return 4,000 Hmong asylum seekers to Laos by the end of the year:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/world/asia/28hmong.html?_r=1&amp;src=twt&amp;twt=nytimes | work=The New York Times | title=Thailand Begins Repatriation of Hmong to Laos | first=Seth | last=Mydans | date=December 28, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the BBC later reported that repatriations had started.&lt;ref name="2009thailand"/&gt; Both United States and United Nations officials have protested this action. Outside government representatives have not been allowed to interview this group over the last three years. [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] has refused to assist the Hmong refugees because of what they have called "increasingly restrictive measures" taken by the Thai military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tragicmountains.org/id100.html BURNING ISSUE: Don't Just Voice Concerns, Offer Solutions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306222533/http://www.tragicmountains.org/id100.html |date=2012-03-06 }} The Nation, December 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Thai military jammed all cellular phone reception and disallowed any foreign journalists from the Hmong camps.&lt;ref name="2009thailand"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8432094.stm |title=Thailand starts deporting Hmong refugees back to Laos |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2009-12-28 |accessdate=2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Ukraine}}
'''Human rights in Ukraine''' is a highly contested topic and in 2018 [[Ukraine]] was labeled as "[[Political freedom|Partly Free]]" by organizations such as [[Freedom House]].&lt;ref name="Freedom House"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/ukraine|title=Freedom in the World 2018|work=freedomhouse.org|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Freedom House]] the human rights situation significantly improved in the aftermath of the [[Euromaidan]] revolution in 2014. The country received better ratings for political pluralism, parliamentary elections, and government transparency. As of 2015 the country is labelled "Partly Free".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/ukraine|title=Ukraine Report: Freedom in the World 2015|publisher=Freedomhouse.org|date=2015|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[OSCE]],  as of 2015 the elections in Ukraine generally respect democratic process, but additional efforts needed to enhance public confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-elections-comply-with-democratic-standards-osce/a-18806618|title=Ukraine elections comply with democratic standards: OSCE|publisher=dw.com|date=26 October 2015|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ukraine local elections generally respected democratic process, but additional efforts needed to enhance public confidence, international observers say|url=http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/ukraine/194401|publisher=[[OSCE]]|date=26 October 2015|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Situation==
[[File:A peaceful demonstration in Kharkiv during the 2004 Orange Revolution.jpg|thumb|Meeting in [[Kharkiv]] during the 2004 [[Orange Revolution]]]]

===Overview===
[[Ukraine]] had been labeled as "free" by organizations such as [[Freedom House]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="Freedom House"/&gt; In their report they stated: "Ukraine has one of the most vibrant civil societies in the region. Citizens are increasingly taking issues into their own hands, protesting against unwanted construction, and exposing corruption. There were no limits seen on [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] activities. [[Trade union]]s function, but strikes and worker protests were infrequently observed, even though dissatisfaction with the [[2008–2009 Ukrainian financial crisis|state of economic affairs was pervasive in the fall of 2008]]. Factory owners were seen as still able to pressure their workers to vote according to the owners’ preferences."&lt;ref name="Freedom House"/&gt; 

On 20 October 2009 experts from the [[Council of Europe]] stated "in the last five years the experts from the Council of Europe who monitor Ukraine have expressed practically no concerns regarding the important [process of the] formation of a [[civil society]] in Ukraine. Ukraine is one of the democratic states in Europe that is securing [[human rights]] as a national policy, as well as securing the rights of national minorities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/experts-of-council-of-europe-have-no-remarks-to-uk-51015.html |title=Experts of Council of Europe have no remarks to Ukraine concerning rights and freedom of citizens |publisher=Kyivpost.com |date=20 October 2009 |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW), "while civil society institutions operate mostly without government interference, police abuse and violations of the rights of vulnerable groups … continue to mar Ukraine's human rights record."&lt;ref name="HRW2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/englishwr2k7/docs/2007/01/11/ukrain14835.htm|title=Ukraine: Events of 2006|work=Human Rights Watch|date=2007|dead-url=y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116150453/http://hrw.org/englishwr2k7/docs/2007/01/11/ukrain14835.htm|archive-date=16 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010|the early 2010 election]] of [[Ukrainian President|President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] international organizations start to voice their concern. According to Freedom House, "Ukraine under President Yanukovych has become less democratic and, if current trends are left unchecked, may head down a path toward autocracy and kleptocracy."&lt;ref name=Ukr2011/&gt; Among the recent negative developments, they mentioned "a more restrictive environment for the media, selective prosecution of opposition figures, worrisome intrusiveness by the [[Security Service of Ukraine]], widely criticized local elections in October 2010 … and erosion of basic freedoms of assembly and speech." This led Freedom House to downgrade Ukraine from "Free" to "Partly Free" in ''Freedom in the World 2011''.&lt;ref name=Ukr2011&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|first1=David J. | last1=Kramer|first2=Robert | last2=Nurick|first3=Damon | last3=Wilson|first4=Evan | last4=Alterman|url=http://freedomhouse.org/uploads/special_report/98.pdf|title=Sounding the Alarm: Protecting Democracy in Ukraine, 2010|work=[[Freedom House]]|date=April 2011|dead-url=y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516011426/http://freedomhouse.org/uploads/special_report/98.pdf|archive-date=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2011 [[Amnesty International]] spoke of "an increase in the number of allegations of torture and ill treatment in [[Prisons in Ukraine|police custody]], restrictions on the freedom of speech and assembly, as well as mass [[Racism in Ukraine|manifestations of xenophobia]]".&lt;ref name=AmInD2011&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/radio-liberty-amnesty-international-notes-worsenin-104315.html|title=Radio Liberty: Amnesty International notes worsening of human rights situation in Ukraine|publisher=[[Kyiv Post]]|date=13 May 2011|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The right to fair trial===
{{main article|Judicial system of Ukraine}}
Amendments to the constitution, which came into force, were detrimental for [[fair trial]] in that they re-introduced the so-called general supervision by the prosecutor's office. Other serious problems included lengthy periods for review of cases because the courts were overloaded; infringement of equality of arms; non-observance of the presumption of innocence; the failure to execute court rulings; and high level of corruption in courts.&lt;ref name="IHFHR"&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/469399ccd.pdf|title=International Helsinki Federation Annual Report on Human Rights Violations (2007): Ukraine|publisher=refworld.org|work=ihf-hr.org|date= 27 March 2007|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent lawyers and human rights activists have complained Ukrainian judges regularly come under pressure to hand down a certain verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Balmforth|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/09/us-ukraine-justice-idUSBRE83809L20120409|title=Insight: In Ukraine, scales of justice often imbalanced|agency=Reuters|date=9 April 2012|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ongoing [[crisis in Ukraine]] has resulted in a major threat to press freedom in recent months.

A crackdown on what authorities describe as "pro-separatist" points of view has triggered dismay among Western human rights monitors. For example, the 11 September 2014 shutdown of {{Interlanguage link multi|Vesti (Ukrainian newspaper)|WD=Q16694375|lt=Vesti}} newspaper by the [[Ukrainian Security Service]] for "violating Ukraine's territorial integrity" brought swift condemnation from the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|author=Fred Weir|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2014/0921/Crackdown-in-Ukraine-sullies-its-democratic-aspirations|title=Crackdown in Ukraine sullies its democratic aspirations|date=21 September 2014|accessdate=4 October 2015|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Former Vesti News's editor-in-chief {{Interlanguage link multi|Igor Guzhva|ru|3=Гужва, Игорь Анатольевич}} wrote on his [[Facebook]] page that the news outlet had been raided by [[Security Service of Ukraine]] (SBU).

Guzhva said that this is the second time in just six months that the SBU has tried to "intimidate" its editors.

===Torture and conditions in detention===
{{main article|Prisons in Ukraine}}
Reports of [[torture]] and ill-treatment by police persisted during 2007 year, as did unduly long periods of pretrial custody. Of major concern were the inhumane conditions in detention with overcrowded cells, appalling sanitary conditions and the lack of appropriate medical care. During the year numerous group suicide attempts took place in some penal colonies.&lt;ref name="IHFHR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=DOC|url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/docs/AdvanceVersions/CAT.C.UKR.CO.5.doc|title=UN Committee against Torture, Conclusions and recommendations: Ukraine|publisher=UNHR|work=Committee against Torture, 38th session 30 April – 18 May 2007|date=2007|dead-url=y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629013039/http://www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/docs/AdvanceVersions/CAT.C.UKR.CO.5.doc|archive-date=29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New evidence of torture was published since May 2016. According to [[Ivan Šimonović]], UN assistant secretary-general for human rights, as published by [[The Times]], both Ukrainian authorities and the authorities of separatist Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics allow torture and run secret jails, and "disregard for human rights" had become entrenched and systemic. The New York Times reports that, after an exchange of prisoners, some detainees have left Ukrainian [[Prisons in Ukraine|jails]] with visible injuries. On 25 May 2016, the United Nations Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture (SPT) suspended its visit to Ukraine after the government had denied it access to places in several parts of the country where it suspects these secret jails were located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kiev allows torture and runs secret jails, says UN|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/kiev-allows-torture-and-runs-secret-jails-says-un-vwlcrpsjn|website=The Times|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.N.

===Human rights abuses and the HIV/AIDS epidemic===
{{main article|HIV/AIDS in Ukraine}}
The Ukrainian government has taken a number of positive steps to fight [[HIV/AIDS]], chiefly in the area of legislative and policy reform. But these important commitments are being undermined in the criminal justice and health systems by widespread human rights abuses against drug users, sex workers, and people living with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="HRW2007"/&gt;

===Migrants and refugees===

The Ukrainian asylum system barely functions due to a highly decentralized structure spanning several government agencies and departments. The process of creating a single migration system has been slow; political interference in the system is common and abuses of [[Immigration|migrants]] and [[asylum seekers]]' rights continue.

=== Human trafficking ===
{{main article|Human trafficking in Ukraine|Human trafficking}}
There has been a growing awareness of human trafficking as a human rights issue in Europe. The end of communism has contributed to an increase in human trafficking, with the majority of victims being women forced into prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/Files/Themes/trafficking/|title=Slaves at the heart of Europe|work=Council of Europe|date=1996|dead-url=y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040307062424/http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/Files/Themes/trafficking/|archive-date=7 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3979725.stm|title=A modern slave's brutal odyssey|publisher=BBC News|date=3 November 2004|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Ukraine was a country of origin and country of transit for persons, primarily women and children, trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation and forced labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/ukraine.htm|title=Ukraine: 2014 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor: Moderate Advancement|work=United States Department of Labor|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charcoal production and pornography have been listed in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]]'s ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' under the country of Ukraine in December 2014.

=== Violence against women ===
{{main article|Violence against women in Ukraine}}
Violence against women is an entrenched social problem in Ukrainian culture engendered by traditional male and female stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kobelyanska |first= Larysa |year= 2000 |title= Making the Transition Work for Women in Europe and Central Asia | chapter= Violence and Trafficking in Women in Ukraine |url= |location= |publisher= World Bank Publications |page= |isbn= 0-8213-4662-8|author-link= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not recognized during Soviet era, but in recent decades the issue became an important topic of discussion in Ukrainian society and among academic scholars. According to the estimation of [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] the violence towards women is widespread in Ukraine and it is associated with three times more deaths than the ongoing armed conflict in the eastern provinces of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fba.se/en/newspress/nyhetsarkiv/2018/the-osce-draws-attention-to-violence-against-women-in-ukraine/ The OSCE draws attention to violence against women in Ukraine] (7 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Linguistic rights]] ===
In 2017 a new law on education has been adopted by Ukrainian government to reform the education system. The language provisions of the law made it highly controversial both locally and in neighboring states, as it envisages that all secondary education will be taught in Ukrainian. According to the law an instruction in minority languages at kindergarten and primary school level remains unaffected, but at the secondary level national minority languages are now being reduced to special lessons. The approval of the legislation provoked a harsh reaction in [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]] and some other countries. For example, Romanian parliament approved declaration criticizing the law and warned that Ukraine cannot go far toward EU integration without a respect to the linguistic rights of national minorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/73272 Ukraine’s Poorly Timed Education Law]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ukrainian authorities have submitted the law for review by the [[Venice Commission]], a body which rules on rights and democracy disputes in Europe. In an opinion adopted formally the commission said that "the strong domestic and international criticism drawn especially by the provisions reducing the scope of education in minority languages seems justified".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-language/criticism-of-ukraines-language-law-justified-rights-body-idUSKBN1E227K Criticism of Ukraine's language law justified: rights body]&lt;/ref&gt;

==War in Donbass==
{{main article|Humanitarian situation during the war in Donbass}}

During the ongoing [[War in Donbass|warfare in Donbass]], Ukraine has lost control over the territories of [[Donetsk People's Republic]] and [[Luhansk People's Republic]] and therefore suspended its human right obligations there.  On 21 May 2015 the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine has passed a resolution declaring that it has withdrawn from some of the obligations stipulated in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]](articles 2, 9, 12, 14, 17), the [[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]](articles 5, 6, 8, 13) and [[European Social Charter]](articles 1 p.&amp;nbsp;2, 4 p.&amp;nbsp;2-3, 8 p.&amp;nbsp;1, 14 p.&amp;nbsp;1, 15,16,17 p.&amp;nbsp;1a p.&amp;nbsp;1c, 23,30, 31 p.&amp;nbsp;1-2) at the [[Donbass]] region until "Russia cease its aggression in eastern Ukraine".&lt;ref name="Bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LB.ua"/&gt;

An '''intelligent designer''', also referred to as an '''intelligent agent''', is the [[hypothesis|hypothetical]] [[Will (philosophy)|willed]] and [[self-awareness|self-aware]] entity that the [[intelligent design movement]] argues had some role in the [[origin of life|origin]] and/or development of life. The term "intelligent cause" is also used, implying their [[teleology|teleological]] supposition of direction and purpose in features of the universe and of living things.

==History==
The popularly termed [[intelligent design movement]] is a [[neo-creationist]] campaign that arose out of the [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]] [[creation science]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context|Ruling, Context]] [[Kitzmiller v.

[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]. (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of [[intelligent design]] argue to the public that their concept does not posit the identity of the designer as part of this effort, but in statements to their constituency, which consists largely of [[Christian right|Christian conservatives]], they identify the designer as [[God#Biblical definition of God|God]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen C. Meyer]] ([[Discovery Institute]]): "I think the designer is God..."

The first thing you understand is that the Darwinian theory isn't true. It's falsified by all of the evidence and the logic is terrible. When you realize that, the next question that occurs to you is, well, where might you get the truth? When I preach from the Bible, as I often do at churches and on Sundays, I don't start with Genesis. I start with John 1:1. In the beginning was the word. In the beginning was intelligence, purpose, and wisdom. The Bible had that right. And the materialist scientists are deluding themselves."

"Intelligent design is just the Logos theology of John's Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory,"  [http://touchstonemag.com/archives/issue.php?id=49 Touchstone Magazine. Volume 12, Issue 4 July/August, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ruling_context&gt;"The only apparent difference between the argument made by Paley and the argument for ID, as expressed by defense expert witnesses Behe and Minnich, is that ID's "official position" does not acknowledge that the designer is God. However, as Dr. Haught testified, anyone familiar with Western religious thought would immediately make the association that the tactically unnamed designer is God, as the description of the designer in Of Pandas and People (hereinafter "Pandas") is a "master intellect," strongly suggesting a supernatural deity as opposed to any intelligent actor known to exist in the natural world. (P-11 at 85). Moreover, it is notable that both Professors Behe and Minnich admitted their personal view is that the designer is God and Professor Minnich testified that he understands many leading advocates of ID to believe the designer to be God. (21:90 (Behe); 38:36-38 (Minnich)). Although proponents of the IDM occasionally suggest that the designer could be a space alien or a time-traveling cell biologist, no serious alternative to God as the designer has been proposed by members of the IDM, including Defendants' expert witnesses. (20:102-03 (Behe)). In fact, an explicit concession that the intelligent designer works outside the laws of nature and science and a direct reference to religion is Pandas’ rhetorical statement, "what kind of intelligent agent was it [the designer]" and answer: "On its own science cannot answer this question. It must leave it to religion and philosophy." (P-11 at 7; 9:13-14 (Haught)). A significant aspect of the IDM is that despite Defendants' protestations to the contrary, it describes ID as a religious argument. In that vein, the writings of leading ID proponents reveal that the designer postulated by their argument is the God of Christianity." [[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context#Page 25 of 139|Dover trial ruling: Context]] [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Discovery Institute has claimed that university criticism of intelligent design is tantamount to "endorsement of an anti-religious view"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestarpress.com/article/20140314/NEWS01/303140002/BSU-intelligent-design?nclick_check=1|title=Lawmakers probe religion vs. science at BSU|date=Mar 13, 2014|author=Seth Slabaug|work=The Star Press|quote=The legislators are acting on behalf of The Discovery Institute, an intelligent design think tank, whose vice president, John West, told The Star Press he is hopeful the legislative investigation will force Ball State to release the report of the faculty review panel... “Ball State ought to be careful,” West said. “I think their mishandling of this could turn into a much bigger deal. Certainly, we are not going away. The speech code against intelligent design is vague and too broad and may not be being applied evenhandedly. We determined through public documents one science class is covering intelligent design in order to bash it. If they allow that, it’s tantamount to state endorsement of an anti-religious view.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity==
[[William Dembski]] states in his book ''[[Design Inference]]'' that the nature of the intelligent designer cannot be inferred from intelligent design&lt;ref&gt;William A. Dembski, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R7otNWMrgcwC&amp;pg=PA9 The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance through Small Probabilities], Cambridge University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-521-62387-2}}, p. 9: "The effect of a design inference is to limit our explanatory options, not to identify a cause.  To identify a cause we need to investigate the particulars of the situation in which design is inferred.  Simply put, we need more details....The design inference does not by itself deliver an intelligent agent."&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that the designer, if one is even necessary for design inference, may or may not be "the God of Scripture."&lt;ref&gt;William A. Dembski, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R7otNWMrgcwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=design+inference+dembski&amp;cd=1#v=snippet&amp;q=intelligent%20agent&amp;f=false The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance through Small Probabilities], Cambridge University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-521-62387-2}}, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2007 Dembski told [[Focus on the Family]], "I believe God created the world for a purpose. The Designer of intelligent design is, ultimately, the Christian God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.citizenlink.org/content/A000006139.cfm | title=Friday Five: William A.

Some leading intelligent design proponents have stated identifying or characterizing the designer is beyond the scope of intelligent design as a line of inquiry. Proponents had hoped that, by avoiding invoking [[Creation myth|creation]] by a specific supernatural entity, (such as that employed by [[creation science]]), intelligent design would be considered scientific and not violate the [[establishment clause]] of the [[US constitution]]. Proponents feared that were intelligent design identified as a restatement of previous forms of creationism, it would be precluded from being taught in public schools after the 1987 [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decision in ''[[Edwards vs Aguillard]]''. This line of reasoning was not particularly persuasive to most in the scientific community, which overwhelmingly rejected intelligent design as both a line of scientific inquiry and as a basis for a sound education in science.

On December 20, 2005 [[United States federal courts|federal district court]] ruled  in ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' that intelligent design was not science and was essentially religious in nature. The ruling not only rendered that public school district's endorsement of intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in science classes unconstitutional
on the grounds that its inclusion violates the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], but validated the objections of critics who discounted proponents' claim that the identity was not God.

Highlighting these mutually exclusive claims about the designer, Dembski, despite having said that the intelligent designer or designers could be any [[deity|god]] or gods, or even [[space alien]]s, has also said that "intelligent design should be understood as the evidence that God has placed in nature to show that the physical world is the product of intelligence and not simply the result of mindless material forces"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designinference.com/documents/2005.08.Commending_President_Bush.pdf Why President Bush Got It Right about Intelligent Design] [[William A. Dembski]] DesignInference.com, August 4, 2005 (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt; and that "Intelligent design is just the Logos theology of John's Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory."&lt;ref&gt;[http://touchstonemag.com/archives/issue.php?id=49 Signs of Intelligence] A Primer on the Discernment of Intelligent Design. [[William A. Dembski]]. Touchstone Journal, Volume 12, Issue 4, July/August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Behe]], in his book [[Darwin's Black Box]], suggested the designer might be a [[time travel]]ing cell biologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Behe| first= Michael J.| title= Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution| year= 1998| publisher= Simon and Schuster| page= 249| isbn= 978-0-7432-1485-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times, leading proponents in the intelligent design movement have clearly expressed that they consider the [[Abrahamic God]] "[[Elohim]]" in his role as a [[creator God]], to be the intelligent designer and denied that intelligent designer is God, depending on which audience they are addressing. One example is William Dembski, who on his blog in response to the question "Is the designer responsible for biological complexity God?" said "not necessarily" and "To ask who or what is the designer of a particular object is to ask for the immediate intelligent agent responsible for its design. The point is that God is able to work through derived or surrogate intelligences, which can be anything from angels to organizing principles embedded in nature."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/603 Who or what is the designer?] William A. Dembski. Uncommon Descent, December 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet to the intelligent design movement's conservative Christian constituents Dembski has said "intelligent design should be understood as the evidence that God has placed in nature to show that the physical world is the product of intelligence and not simply the result of mindless material forces. This evidence is available to all apart from the special revelation of God in salvation history as recounted in Scripture. ... Intelligent design makes it impossible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. This gives intelligent design incredible traction as a tool for apologetics, opening up the God-question to individuals who think that science has buried God"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designinference.com/documents/2005.08.Commending_President_Bush.pdf Commending President Bush] William A. Dembski.

== Claimed actions ==
Opinion as to the amount of creation the intelligent designer has done varies within the ID movement.  [[Michael Behe]]'s concept of [[irreducible complexity]] has [[natural selection]] accounting for most of [[evolution]] but the intelligent designer contributing the design of some [[protein]]s.  Others in the ID movement however contest concepts such as [[common descent]], particularly of [[human]]s and other [[ape]]s. Though most in the ID movement seem to be [[Old Earth Creationist]]s, a few are [[Young Earth Creationist]]s who believe in [[ex-nihilo]].

The amount of creation that the intelligent designer did has also been criticised by [[Young Earth Creationist]]s as not being specific enough, and particularly contradicting their beliefs of [[Biblical inerrancy]] and a young earth.&lt;ref name="aig_views"&gt;AiG’s views on the Intelligent Design Movement - by Carl Wieland, 30 August 2002 [http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2002/0830_IDM.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="morris_design_not_enough"&gt;'Design is Not Enough' - by Henry H. Morris, ''Back to Genesis'' pamphlet series, No.127a, July 1999, Institute for Creation Research. [http://www.icr.org/article/859/]&lt;/ref&gt; Some intelligent design proponents say the intelligent designer [[fine-tuned universe|fine-tuned the universe's]] [[physical constant]]s in such a way that life is the result of the universe's physical constants being related to one another in a fashion that permits life to exist. The [[fine-tuned universe|fine-tuned universe argument]] is a central premise or presented as a given in many of the published works of prominent intelligent design proponents, such as [[William A. Dembski]] and [[Michael Behe]].

== Criticism ==
Intelligent design has been presented by its proponents as a "big tent" strategy into which several accounts of creation can fit. Were a "scientific" version of intelligent design approved for inclusion in public school science curricula, then a path would be opened for discussion of alternatives to not only [[natural selection]] but [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] as well, and eventually religious accounts on the [[origin of life]].  The vast majority of scientists reject the concept of intelligent design and an intelligent designer. Instead, the most widely accepted explanation is that physical processes such as natural selection can account for the complexity of life and other phenomena and features of the universe. Attempts to insert theories of intelligent design into public school science curricula fits in with the intelligent design movement's social aims, via the overturning of Western secularism as detailed in the [[Wedge strategy]]. The concept of the intelligent designer has been criticised as a [[God of the gaps#The "God-of-the-gaps argument" in modern usage|God-of-the-gaps]] argument. Introducing the hypothesis of an intelligent designer introduces the unsolved problem of accounting for the origin of such a designer ([[first cause]]).

By raising the question of the need for a designer for objects with irreducible complexity, intelligent design also raises the question, "what designed the designer?"  [[Richard Dawkins]] has argued that "If complex organisms demand an explanation, so does a complex designer. And it's no solution to raise the theologian's plea that God (or the intelligent designer) is simply immune to the normal demands of scientific explanation,"&lt;ref name="dawkins_complexdesigner"&gt;"If complex organisms demand an explanation, so does a complex designer. And it's no solution to raise the theologian's plea that God (or the Intelligent Designer) is simply immune to the normal demands of scientific explanation. To do so would be to shoot yourself in the foot." Richard Dawkins and Jerry Coyne. 1 September 2005. The Guardian [https://www.theguardian.com/life/feature/story/0,13026,1559743,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; since such an answer would be unscientific.  With religious creationism, the question "what created God?" can be answered with theological arguments, but in intelligent design, the chain of designers can be followed back indefinitely in an [[Turtles all the way down|infinite regression]], leaving the question of the creation of the first designer dangling. As a result, intelligent design does not explain how the complexity happened in the first place; it just moves it.&lt;ref name="dawkins_time_2"&gt;Claudia Wallis. Evolution Wars. Time Magazine, 15 August 2005 edition, page 32 [http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1090909,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elliott Sober]] says that by intelligent design's own arguments, a designer capable of creating irreducible complexity must also be irreducibly complex: "Any mind in nature that designs and builds an irreducibly complex system is itself irreducibly complex"&lt;ref name="sober"&gt;[http://philosophy.wisc.edu/sober/ID%20and%20the%20Supernatural%20final%20F&amp;P%20single.pdf  Intelligent Design Theory and the  Supernatural - The "God or Extra-terrestrials" Reply] Elliott Sober. University of Wisconsin - Madison.&lt;/ref&gt; Sober says that this an argument that intelligent design proponents still need to respond to.

If intelligent design proponents invoke an [[uncaused causer]] or [[deity]] to resolve this problem,&lt;ref name="wdd2"&gt;"Christianity postulates the religious answer to this question that the designer is God who by definition is eternally existent and has no origin. There is no logical philosophical impossibility with this being the case (akin to Aristotle's 'unmoved mover') as a religious answer to the origin of the designer. See also an answer to a subissue the implications of whether or not the first CSI come from an unintelligent source." FAQ: Who designed the designer? IDEA [http://www.ideacenter.org/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/1147]&lt;/ref&gt; they contradict a fundamental assumption of intelligent design that design requires a designer&lt;ref name="fundamental_assumption"&gt;"''Intelligent design, on the other hand, involves two basic assumptions: 1) Intelligent causes exist. 2) These causes can be empirically detected (by looking for specified complexity).''" Access Research Network. Frequently Asked Questions about Intelligent Design. [http://www.arn.org/idfaq/Isn%27t%20%27intelligent%20design%27%20another%20name%20for%20%27scientific%20creationism%27.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sc_indicates_design"&gt;"''According to contemporary design theory, the presence of highly specified complexity is an indicator of an intelligent cause.''" Access Research Network. Frequently Asked Questions about Intelligent Design. [http://www.arn.org/idfaq/How%20can%20you%20tell%20if%20something%20is%20designed.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and reduce intelligent design to religious creationism.  Another possible counter-argument might be an [[Turtles all the way down|infinite regression]] of designers. However, admitting infinite numbers of objects also allows any arbitrarily improbable event to occur,&lt;ref name="arbitrarily_improbable"&gt;"To explain the origin of the DNA/protein machine by invoking a supernatural Designer is to explain precisely nothing, for it leaves unexplained the origin of the Designer. You have to say something like 'God was always there', and if you allow yourself that kind of lazy way out, you might as well just say 'DNA was always there', or "Life was always there',  and be done with it." Richard Dawkins. ''The Blind Watchmaker : Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design'' pg 141&lt;/ref&gt; such as an object with "specific" complexity assembling itself by chance. Again, this contradicts a fundamental assumption of intelligent design that a designer is needed for every specifically complex object, producing a logical contradiction.

Critics contend the claim that positing a designer which explains gaps in our understanding yet does not need to be itself explained as not a contribution to knowledge but as a [[thought-terminating cliché]].&lt;ref name=Rosenhouse&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/intelligentdesignwatch/designer.html Who Designed the Designer?] Jason Rosenhouse. Creation &amp; Intelligent Design Watch, Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins. The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design pg 141&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Dover trial==
In 2005, intelligent design proponents arguments regarding the identity of a designer became an issue considered by the court in ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', the "Dover trial," where plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy requiring the presentation of intelligent design as an alternative to [[evolution]] as an "explanation of the origin of life" thus violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. In his ruling, the judge, John E. Jones III, stated
{{Quotation|"However, as Dr. Haught testified, anyone familiar with Western religious thought would immediately make the association that the tactically unnamed designer is God..."  -- [[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 25 of 139|''Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, page 25'']]}}

Jones also commented that the appearance of design is [[Subjectivity|subjective]]:
{{Quotation|"It is readily apparent to the Court that the only attribute of design that biological systems appear to share with human artifacts is their complex appearance, i.e. if it looks complex or designed, it must have been designed. (23:73 (Behe)). This inference to design based upon the appearance of a "purposeful arrangement of parts" is a completely subjective proposition, determined in the eye of each beholder and his/her viewpoint concerning the complexity of a system."  -- [[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 81 of 139|''Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, page 81'']]}}

{{Quotation|"For human artifacts, we know the designer's identity, human, and the mechanism of design, as we have experience based upon empirical evidence that humans can make such things, as well as many other attributes including the designer's abilities, needs, and desires. With ID, proponents assert that they refuse to propose hypotheses on the designer's identity, do not propose a mechanism, and the designer, he/she/it/they, has never been seen. In that vein, defense expert Professor Minnich agreed that in the case of human artifacts and objects, we know the identity and capacities of the human designer, but we do not know any of those attributes for the designer of biological life. In addition, Professor Behe agreed that for the design of human artifacts, we know the designer and its attributes and we have a baseline for human design that does not exist for design of biological systems. Professor Behe's only response to these seemingly insurmountable points of disanalogy was that the inference still works in science fiction movies. -- [[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 81 of 139|''Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, page 81'']]}}

The judge ruled that "ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents"&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#H. Conclusion|Ruling]], [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], Case No. 04cv2688. December 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and "that ID is an interesting theological argument, but that it is not science."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 89 of 139|Ruling, Whether ID Is Science]], [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], Case No. 04cv2688. December 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5337">'''Inter-protocol exploitation''' is a class of [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerabilities]] that takes advantage of interactions between two communication [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngssoftware.com/research/papers/InterProtocolCommunication.pdf|title=Inter-protocol Communication|date= Aug 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example the protocols used in the [[Internet]]. It is commonly discussed in the context of the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] ([[HTTP]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remote.org/jochen/sec/hfpa/index.html|title=HTML Form Protocol Attack}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Exploit (computer security)|attack]] uses the potential of the two different protocols meaningfully communicating commands and data.

It was popularized in 2007 and publicly described in research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngssoftware.com/Libraries/Documents/03_07_Inter-Protocol_Exploitation.sflb.ashx|title=Inter-protocol Exploitation|date=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the same year. The general class of attacks that it refers to has been known since at least 1994 (see the Security Considerations section of RFC 1738).

[[Internet protocol]] implementations allow for the possibility of encapsulating [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit code]] to compromise a remote program which uses a different protocol. Inter-protocol exploitation can utilize inter-protocol communication to establish the preconditions for launching an inter-protocol exploit. For example, this process could negotiate the initial authentication communication for a vulnerability in password parsing. Inter-protocol exploitation is where one protocol attacks a service running a different protocol. This is a legacy problem because the specifications of the protocols did not take into consideration an attack of this type.

==Technical details==
The two protocols involved in the vulnerability are termed the carrier and target. The carrier [[Encapsulation (networking)|encapsulates]] the commands and/or data. The target protocol is used for communication to the intended victim service. Inter-protocol communication will be successful if the carrier [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] can encapsulate the commands and/or data sufficiently to meaningfully communicate to the target [[Service (systems architecture)|service]].

Two preconditions need to be met for successful communication across protocols: encapsulation and error tolerance. The carrier protocol must encapsulate the data and commands in a manner that the target protocol can understand. It is highly likely that the resulting [[data stream]] with induce [[parsing]] errors in the target protocol.

The target protocol be must be sufficiently [[error tolerance|forgiving of errors]]. During the inter-protocol connection it is likely that a percentage of the communication will be invalid and cause errors. To meet this precondition, the target protocol implementation must continue processing despite these errors.

==Current implications==
One of the major points of concern is the potential for this attack vector to reach through [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] and [[Demilitarized zone (computing)|DMZ]]s. Inter-protocol exploits can be transmitted over [[HTTP]] and launched from [[web browsers]] on an internal [[subnetwork|subnet]]. An important point is the web browser is not exploited through any conventional means.

==Example==
JavaScript delivered over HTTP and communicating over the IRC protocol.
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
var form = document.createElement('form');
form.setAttribute('method', 'post');
form.setAttribute('action', 'http://irc.example.net:6667');
form.setAttribute('enctype', 'multipart/form-data');

var textarea = document.createElement('textarea');
textarea.innerText = "USER A B C D \nNICK turtle\nJOIN #hack\nPRIVMSG #hackers: I like turtles\n";

form.appendChild(textarea);
document.body.appendChild(form);
form.submit();
&lt;/source&gt;Known examples of the vulnerability were also demonstrated on files constructed to be valid [[HTML]] code and [[BMP file format|BMP]] image at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Marco Ramilli's Blog: Hacking through images|url = http://marcoramilli.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/hacking-through-images.html|website = marcoramilli.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Signing the document content is not enough: A new attack to digital signature|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=4664402|date = August 2008|access-date = 2015-05-13|pages = 520–525|doi = 10.1109/ICADIWT.2008.4664402|first = F.|last = Buccafurri|first2 = G.|last2 = Caminiti|first3 = G.|last3 = Lax}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.softcomputing.net/jias/buccafurri.pdf|url = http://www.softcomputing.net/jias/buccafurri.pdf|website = www.softcomputing.net|accessdate = 2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==
After graduating from the [[University of Nottingham]], Goodwin worked briefly at [[Coopers and Lybrand]],&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/yourbusiness/9542128/Digital-stars-tackle-elitist-media-and-tech-sectors.html|title=Digital stars tackle 'elitist' media and tech sectors|work=The Daily Telegraph|author=Your Business|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where for one assignment he was asked to compile two reports. One report was to be on a "fascinating" proposed deal in the media sector, the other involved research into car component manufacturers; at that moment Goodwin realised he would "...prefer castration" to car parts: “Every deal I’ve worked on has been in and around the media sector since then,” he told ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/yourbusiness/9542128/Digital-stars-tackle-elitist-media-and-tech-sectors.html|title=Digital stars tackle 'elitist' media and tech sectors|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodwin then spent a year at private equity group [[Apax Partners]], before leaving to join a News Corporation/Liberty Media-backed buyout of [[Talk Radio UK|Talk Radio]] in 1997. He was appointed managing director of Talk Radio, which went on to become the foundation for The Wireless Group PLC, for which Goodwin was Group managing director under [[Kelvin Mackenzie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/talk-radio-announces-management-shake-up/42973#|title=Talk Radio announces management shake-up|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2886011/Media-star-rises-with-legendary-Sun-editor.html|title=Media star rises with legendary Sun editor|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Goodwin and Julian Culhane co-founded LongAcre Partners, a corporate finance boutique. LongAcre worked with [[Elisabeth Murdoch (businesswoman)|Elisabeth&amp;nbsp;Murdoch]], helping to build her TV production business [[Shine TV (UK)|Shine]] via a series of acquisitions. LongAcre was also involved in the £175m sale of&amp;nbsp;[[Friends Reunited]] to ITV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://perspectives.pictet.com/2013/09/12/the-digital-media-investor-and-entrepreneur/|title=The digital media investor and entrepreneur – Perspectives Pictet|last=Pictet|website=perspectives.pictet.com|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; LongAcre's investors included the law firm [[Olswang]] and private equity house Corsair. In 2007 LongAcre was sold to US investment bank [[Jefferies Group|Jefferies]]. Goodwin remained at Jeffries as Head of Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications until 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Lepe Partners ==
In 2011 Goodwin and Culhane co-founded Lepe Partners a merchant bank focused on the media internet and technology sectors. The company was named after [[Lepe, Hampshire|a hamlet and beach in Hampshire]] where Goodwin spends his weekends.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In addition to its advisory work, Lepe operates a venture growth fund which provides capital and strategic support to late stage venture growth opportunities in industry verticals.  The fund is structured as a pledge fund based on annual commitments, with deals sourced through Lepe's business contacts.Lepe's portfolio includes: Pharmacy2U, Boat International Media, CreativeLive, Masabi, and Festicket. The fund successfully exited its investment in Wahanda (now Treatwell) in 2015, following a sale of the business to Recruit Holding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masabi.com/2015/12/07/10839/|title=Mobile Ticketing Leader Masabi Secures $12m Growth Funding From Keolis, Lepe Partners, MasterCard, and MMC Ventures|last=Gooch|first=James|date=7 December 2015|website=Masabi|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iq-mag.net/2016/07/festival-package-site-festicket-raises-6-3-million/|title=Festival package site Festicket raises $6.3m {{!}} IQ Magazine|date=1 July 2016|newspaper=IQ Magazine|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/400e4076-8709-11e1-ad68-00144feab49a?sectionid=stream/peopleId/TnN0ZWluX1BOXzIwMDkwNjIzXzE3NjM=-UE4=|title=Goodwin departs Jefferies to set up bank|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lepe has advised on investment deals for [[News Corp]], [[Ministry of Sound]] and [[TalkTalk Group|TalkTalk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2016-08-11/sale-of-ministry-of-sound-label-music-to-lepe-partners-ears|title=Ministry of Sound sale music to dealmaker's ears|last=Burke|first=Lucy Burton and Tim|date=11 August 2016|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/30/rupert-murdochs-news-corp-buys-talksport-owner-in-220m-deal|title=Rupert Murdoch's News Corp buys TalkSport owner in £220m deal|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=30 June 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founders Forum ==

In 2006 Goodwin and Hoberman created Founders Forum, an invitation-only network for digital entrepreneurs, corporate CEOs and senior investors. The Forum has 1500 members and has become known as a Europe-based equivalent of [[Sun Valley, Los Angeles|Sun Valley]], the Allen &amp; Co retreat for media executives in the US. Speakers and attendees at previous Forum meetings include [[Richard Branson|Sir Richard Branson]], [[Arianna Huffington]], [[Eric Schmidt]], [[Reid Hoffman]], [[Sean Parker]],&amp;nbsp;[[Niklas Zennström|Niklas Zennstrom]], [[Mikitani Hiroshi|Mikitani]] [[Mikitani Hiroshi|Hiroshi]], [[Ben Horowitz]], [[Natalie Massenet]], [[Charles Dunstone]], [[Tony Fadell]], [[Natalia Vodianova|Natalie Vodianova]], [[Jessica Alba]], [[Peter Gabriel|Peter Gabrie]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l, [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Daniel Ek]] and [[Ari Emanuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/london-the-new-silicon-valley-8890601.html|title=London: the new Silicon Valley?|date=19 October 2013|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/lucian-grainge-banging-the-drum-for-the-uk-in-la-8488078.html|title=Lucian Grainge: Banging the drum for the UK in LA|date=8 February 2013|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Events are currently held in London, Paris, [[Madrid]], [[Istanbul]], Los Angeles, New York City, Rio de Janeiro, [[Mumbai]], New Delhi, [[Qingdao]] and Singapore.  In 2013 the ''Financial Times'' announced a media partnership with the Forum, presenting two awards at that year's London event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.inpublishing.co.uk/news/articles/ft_partners_with_founders_forum.aspx|title=FT partners with Founders Forum|last=InPublishing|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, Founders Forum and the [[British government departments|British Government's]] [[UK Trade &amp; Investment]] arm created the Technology Innovators' Forum (TIF-IN), which connects new UK businesses with influential heads of content, media and finance companies worldwide.

In 2009 Goodwin, Hoberman and other partners co-founded PROfounders Capital, an early stage fund backed by entrepreneurs for digital entrepreneurs. One of its first investments was UK-based [[TweetDeck]], the online application sold two years later to Twitter for $40m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8f68fed2-8704-11e0-92df-00144feabdc0|title=Twitter acquires UK's TweetDeck for $40m|website=Financial Times|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founders Forum has launched a number of initiatives under the Founders aegis, including the executive search arm Founders Keepers and the strategic consultancy Founders Intelligence.

== Philanthropy ==
=== Founders Pledge ===
In June 2015 Goodwin co-launched [[Founders Pledge]], a UK- and US-registered charity to enable tech entrepreneurs to commit to donating at least 2% of their personal proceeds to philanthropic causes upon exit.&lt;sup&gt;[[Founders Pledge#cite note-80000-hours-interview-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Founders Pledge's declared mission is to "...strip down the barriers to charitable giving, making it easy for technology entrepreneurs to give back to society." The Pledge's service is paid for by sponsors, partners, and private donors, and is offered free to entrepreneurs. Founders Pledge also offers post-exit support, including charity sourcing, due diligence and impact reporting. 

At launch, £18.5m was pledged by leaders of 50 UK technology companies, including&amp;nbsp;Alex Depledge of [[Hassle.com]], José Neves of&amp;nbsp;Farfetch, Ben Medlock from&amp;nbsp;[[SwiftKey]]&amp;nbsp;and James Alexander of&amp;nbsp;Zopa. Founder's Pledge has facilitated the giving of $15.5&amp;nbsp;million to charities of donors' choices and has secured a further $180&amp;nbsp;million in legally binding pledges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://startups.co.uk/entrepreneurs-encouraged-to-pledge-2-of-proceeds-following-business-exit/|title=Entrepreneurs encouraged to pledge 2% of proceeds to charity following an exit – Startups.co.uk: Starting a business advice and business ideas|date=2 March 2016|access-date=9 November 2016|newspaper=Startups.co.uk: Starting a business advice and business ideas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.varsity.co.uk/news/11019|title=David Goldberg: ‘Find the thing that gets you out of bed in the morning’|access-date=9 November 2016|newspaper=Varsity Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; 

In March 2016 Founders Pledge launched Founders of the Future, a philanthropic initiative that uses artificial intelligence and recommendations to uncover entrepreneurial talent in the 15–35 age group who are not currently founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/london-tech-entrepreneur-matt-miller-10-downing-street-shorts-founders-of-the-future-ed-vaizey-2016-3|title=A high-flying London tech entrepreneur rocked up to No. 10 in shorts and Ed Vaizey loved it|access-date=9 November 2016|newspaper=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp; 

Founders Pledge has also entered partnerships with US seed accelerators [[MassChallenge]] and [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]], to obtain pledges from their funded companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/y-combinator-signs-up-to-founders-pledge-charity-scheme-for-social-causes/|title=Y Combinator signs up to Founders Pledge charity scheme for social causes|last=Butcher|first=Mike|website=TechCrunch|access-date=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/masschallenge-blog/masschallenge-partners-with-founders-pledge-to-help-entrepreneurs-pay-it-forward-4f901862b5a7|title=MassChallenge Partners with Founders Pledge to Help Entrepreneurs Pay It Forward – MassChallenge Blog|last=UK|first=MassChallenge|date=3 March 2016|website=Medium|access-date=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

=== Founders Forum Foundation ===
Goodwin joined with Hoberman and lastminute.com co-founder [[Martha Lane Fox]] to develop the Founders Forum Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mandrakelondon.com/past-mandrake-events/|title=The Mandrake – Past Events|newspaper=The Mandrake|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation facilitates internships and scholarships to school-leavers from across the UK, to break down the barriers that Goodwin believes result in the majority of media and tech company leaders coming from privileged backgrounds. Goodwin also believes entrepreneurship can address the problems faced by young people, especially "NEETs" ("not in employment, education or training").

Goodwin is disparaging of large tech firms for not doing enough to engage with the UK communities in which they operate, and for failing to paying enough tax: “We should be leaning on them harder to put more back into the country,” he told ''The Telegraph'' newspaper. “I’m not talking about complicated tax structures – we need to [encourage them] to put more back into the cities they're a part of. We're sometimes so afraid of our own shadow that they'll go somewhere else, but where are they going to go? If you want a [European] headquarters, London is the best place to be."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== Founders Forum for Good ===
In 2012 Founders Forum announced the launch of Founders Forum For Good. Led by [[Martha Lane Fox|Martha Lane-Fox]] and with Board members including Goodwin, [[Jimmy Wales]] and [[Michael Richard Lynch|Mike Lynch]], Founders Forum for Good's mission is to bring together digital entrepreneurs with the leaders of social and environmental organisations to tackle social issues and inequalities. In June 2013 the following year the Forum partnered with [[Nominet UK|Nominet Trust]] to launch Social Tech, Social Change, a £1m fund providing early-stage finance for social entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/10612234/Why-business-should-do-more-to-benefit-society.html|title=Why business should do more to benefit society|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Goodwin is married to Flora Hesketh, the daughter of [[Alexander Fermor-Hesketh, 3rd Baron Hesketh]], the former Conservative Party treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/jonnie-goodwin-the-entrepreneur-taking-our-top-tech-stars-to-tinseltown-8476921.html|title=Jonnie Goodwin: the entrepreneur taking our top tech stars to|author=|date=|website=standard.co.uk|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodwin's hobbies include sailing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yachtingworld.com/performance-world/news/532463/aam-cowes-week-day-seven|title=Aberdeen Asset Management Cowes Week day seven &amp;#124; Racing news from|date=17 August 2012|publisher=Yachting World|author=Louay Habib|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 he campaigned the J/109 ''Harlequin'', becoming the overall winner at [[Cowes Week]] 2012 for both the White Group, J/109 group, and Cowes Week overall.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2026">'''Judaic Publishing Co.''' was an [[antisemitic]] publishing entity controlled by [[Henry Hamilton Beamish]], an Irish-born antisemite. In 1920 Beamish took over the publication of ''[[The Jewish Peril]]'' from [[Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode]], and published it under the [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of '''[[The Britons]]'''. Subsequently, this entity was effectively merged by Beamish and his associates into the [[Britons Publishing Company]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=nqACzm2XB3gC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=%22Judaic+publishing+company%22&amp;sig=DhSz6uV5Bt7pNcLnMiQz6hTPVAE], which continued disseminating antisemitic [[propaganda]] [http://www.yale.edu/isps/seminars/antisemitism/Shain.pdf].

'''Methyl cellulose''' (or '''methylcellulose''') is a [[chemical compound]] derived from [[cellulose]]. It is a [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] white powder in pure form and dissolves in cold (but not in hot) water, forming a clear viscous solution or gel. It is sold under a variety of trade names and is used as a thickener and [[emulsifier]] in various food and cosmetic products, and also as a treatment of [[constipation]]. Like cellulose, it is not digestible, not toxic, and not an [[allergen]].

== Chemistry ==
Methyl cellulose does not occur naturally and is synthetically produced by heating cellulose with caustic solution (e.g. a solution of [[sodium hydroxide]]) and treating it with [[methyl chloride]]. In the substitution reaction that follows, the [[hydroxyl]] residues (-OH functional groups) are replaced by [[methoxide]] (-OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups).

Different kinds of methyl cellulose can be prepared depending on the number of hydroxyl groups substituted. Cellulose is a [[polymer]] consisting of numerous linked [[glucose]] molecules, each of which exposes three hydroxyl groups. The ''Degree of Substitution'' (DS) of a given form of methyl cellulose is defined as the average number of substituted hydroxyl groups per glucose. The theoretical maximum is thus a DS of 3.0, however more typical values are 1.3–2.6.

Different methyl cellulose preparations can also differ in the average length of their polymer backbones.

== Solubility and temperature ==

Methyl cellulose has a [[lower critical solution temperature]] (LCST) between 40&amp;nbsp;°C and 50&amp;nbsp;°C. At temperatures below the LCST, it is readily [[solubility|soluble]] in water; above the LCST, it is not soluble, which has a paradoxical effect that heating a saturated solution of methyl cellulose will turn it solid, because methyl cellulose will [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] out. The temperature at which this occurs depends on DS-value, with higher DS-values giving lower solubility and lower precipitation temperatures because the [[polar molecule|polar]] hydroxyl groups are masked.

Preparing a solution of methyl cellulose with cold water is difficult however: as the powder comes into contact with water, a gel layer forms around it, dramatically slowing the diffusion of water into the powder, hence the inside remains dry. A better way is to first mix the powder with hot water, so that the methyl cellulose particles are well dispersed (and so have a much higher effective surface area) in the water, and cool down this dispersion while stirring, leading to the much more rapid dissolution of those particles.

== Uses ==

Methyl cellulose has an extremely wide range of uses, of which several are described below.

===Consumer products===

==== Thickener and emulsifier ====
Methyl cellulose is very occasionally added to [[Shampoo|hair shampoo]]s, [[tooth paste]]s and liquid soaps, to generate their characteristic thick consistency. This is also done for foods, for example [[ice cream]] or [[croquette]]. Methyl cellulose is also an important [[emulsifier]], preventing the separation of two mixed liquids because it is an emulsion stabilizer.

The [[E number]] of methyl cellulose as food additive is E461. E464 is Hydroxypropylcellulose and better soluble in water.

Methyl cellulose (a.k.a. "Methocel", produced by Dow Chemical or "Mecellose", produced by Samsung Fine Chemicals) is also used as paint rheological modifier to prevent paint sagging.

====Advanced cookery ====
Methyl cellulose, as a [[gel]], has the unique property of setting when hot and [[melting]] when cold. The culinary potential of this property is currently being explored at the [[University of Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blumenthal|first=Heston|title=The Appliance of Science (Melting Point)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/nov/20/foodanddrink.shopping3|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=8 August 2012|language=|date=19 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lubricant ====
Methyl cellulose is used as a variable [[viscosity]] personal lubricant; it is the main ingredient in [[K-Y Jelly]].

=== Clinical ===

The lubricating property of methyl cellulose is of particular benefit in the treatment of dry eyes ([[Keratoconjunctivitis]] [[Sjögren's syndrome|Sicca]]).&lt;ref name="Eye Disease In Hot Climates"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sandford-Smith, John |title=Eye Diseases In Hot Climates |publisher=ELBS British Government|year= 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dry eyes are common in the elderly and is often associated with [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. The lacrimal gland and the accessory conjunctival glands produce fewer [[tears]]. Methyl cellulose may be used as a tear substitute.

==== Artificial tears and saliva ====
Solutions containing methyl cellulose or similar cellulose derivatives are used as substitute for [[tears]] or [[saliva]] if the natural production of these fluids is disturbed.

==== Nutritional supplement capsules ====
Methyl cellulose is used in the manufacture of capsules in nutritional supplements, it is edible and nontoxic properties provide a vegetarian alternative to the use of [[gelatin]].

==== Treatment of constipation ====
When eaten, methyl cellulose is not absorbed by the intestines but passes through the digestive tract undisturbed. It attracts large amounts of water into the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], producing a softer and bulkier stool. It is used to treat [[constipation]], [[diverticulosis]], [[hemorrhoids]] and [[irritable bowel syndrome]]. It should be taken with sufficient amounts of fluid to prevent [[dehydration]].

A well-known trade name of methyl cellulose when used as a drug is '''Citrucel''' by [[GlaxoSmithKline]], but [[generic drug|generic versions]] are also widely available.

=== Construction materials ===
Methyl cellulose finds a major application as a performance additive in construction materials. It is added to [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] dry mixes to improve the mortar's properties such as workability, open and adjustment time, water retention, viscosity, adhesion to surfaces etc. Construction grade methyl cellulose is not to be identified with food and pharmaceutical grade methyl cellulose and [[hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose]], as it may be cross-linked with [[glyoxal]] for easy dispersion in water.

The construction materials can be cement-based or gypsum-based. Notable examples of dry mixture mortars which utilize methyl cellulose include tile adhesives, EIFS, insulating plasters, hand-troweled and machine-sprayed plaster, stucco, self-leveling flooring, extruded cement panels, skim coats, joint &amp; crack fillers, and tile grouts. Typical usage is about 0.2% – 0.5% of total dry powder weight for dry mixtures.

Derivatives of methyl cellulose which improve performance characteristics include [[hypromellose|hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose]] (HPMC) and [[hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose]] (HEMC). These derivatives typically improve the characteristics such as water retention, vertical surface slip resistance, open time, etc.

==== Glue and binder ====
Methyl cellulose can be employed as a mild [[glue]] which can be washed away with water. This may be used in the fixing of delicate pieces of art as well as in book conservation to loosen and clean off old glue from spines and bookboards.

Methyl cellulose is the main ingredient in many [[wallpaper paste]]s. It is also used as a binder in [[pastel|pastel crayons]] and also as a [[Excipient#Binders|binder]] in medications.

==== Paper and textile sizing ====
Methyl cellulose is used as [[sizing]] in the production of papers and textiles as it protects the fibers from absorbing water or oil.

=== Cell culture/virology ===

Methyl cellulose is also used in [[cell culture]] to study [[Virus|viral]] replication. It is dissolved in the same nutrient-containing [[Growth medium|medium]] in which cells are normally grown. A [[Monolayer#Biology|single layer of cells]] is grown on a flat surface, then infected with a virus for a short time. The strength of the viral sample used will determine how many cells get infected during this time. The thick methyl cellulose medium is then added on top of the cells in place of normal liquid medium. As the viruses replicate in the infected cells, they are able to spread between cells whose membranes touch each other, but are trapped when they enter the methyl cellulose. Only cells closely neighboring an infected cell will become infected and die. This leaves small regions of dead cells called [[Viral plaque|plaques]] in a larger background of living uninfected cells. The number of plaques formed is determined by the strength of the original sample.

==== Bacterial and protozoal motility inhibitor ====
Aqueous methyl cellulose solutions have been used to slow bacterial and protozoal cell motility for closer inspection. Changing the amount of methyl cellulose in solution permits the adjustment of the solution's viscosity.

==== Stem cell differentiation ====
Methyl cellulose is used in the most common approaches to quantify multiple or single lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitors, called colony-forming cells (CFCs) or colony-forming units (CFUs), in combination with culture supplements that promote their proliferation and differentiation, and allow the clonal progeny of a single progenitor cell to stay together and thus form a colony of more mature cells.

===Chemistry===

Methyl cellulose is used as a buffer additive in [[capillary electrophoresis]] to control [[electroosmotic flow]] for improved separations.

=== Special effects ===

The slimy, gooey appearance of an appropriate preparation of methyl cellulose with water, in addition to its nontoxic, nonallergenic, and edible properties, makes it popular for use in special effects for [[motion picture]]s and [[television]] wherever vile slimes must be simulated. In the film ''[[Ghostbusters]],'' the gooey substance the supernatural entities used to “slime” the Ghostbusters was mostly a thick water solution of methyl cellulose.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' ooze and drip a great deal of methyl cellulose—especially the queen.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Methyl cellulose has been used to safely simulate molten materials, as well. In several of the [[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]] films, it was [[backlighting|back-lit]] with colored gels and films to reproduce the heated glow of iron in the large pouring ladles used to transport the metal from the smelting ovens to the various molds and forms.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Methyl cellulose was also a stand-in for the lava flows in [[Los Angeles]] in ''[[Volcano (1997 film)|Volcano]]'' and on the volcanic surface of [[Mustafar]], in ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The '''National Party''' was a party in the [[Isle of Man]] that identified itself with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|UK Conservatives]].  They were active in the period between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] in opposing the activities of the [[Manx Labour Party]]. However, unlike the Manx Labour Party, they were unsuccessful in establishing themselves over the longer term and they folded.

The '''Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act''' (79 P.L. 396, 60 Stat. 230)  is a [[United States federal law]] that created the '''National School Lunch Program''' ('''NSLP''') to provide low-cost or free [[School meal|school lunch meals]] to qualified&lt;!-- how do they qualify? --&gt; students through subsidies to schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://federaleducationpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/1946-national-school-lunch-act/ Copy of the School Lunch Act As Enacted in 1946], Federal Education Policy History website&lt;/ref&gt; The program was established as a way to prop up food prices by absorbing farm surpluses, while at the same time providing food to school age children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/Lunch/AboutLunch/ProgramHistory_4.htm The National School Lunch Program Background and Development]&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after [[Richard Russell,&amp;nbsp;Jr.]], signed into law by President [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=12410|title=Harry S. Truman: Statement by the President Upon Signing the National School Lunch Act.|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entered the federal government into schools dietary programs on June 4, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;https://federaleducationpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/1946-national-school-lunch-act/&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the support provided to schools participating in the program comes in the form of a cash reimbursement for each meal served. Schools are also entitled to receive commodity foods and additional commodities as they are available from surplus agricultural stocks. The National School Lunch Program serves 30.5&amp;nbsp;million children each day at a cost of $8.7&amp;nbsp;billion for fiscal year 2007. Most participants are also eligible for food during the summer through the [[Summer Food Service Program]].

== Early programs ==
School feeding in the United States underwent the same evolution as in Europe, beginning with sporadic food services undertaken by private societies and associations interested in child welfare and education. The Children's Aid Society of New York initiated a program in 1853, serving meals to students attending the vocational school.&lt;ref name=EarlyPrograms&gt;{{cite web |author1=Gordon W. Gunderson |title=National School Lunch Program: Early Programs by State |url=https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp/history_2#earlyprograms |publisher=USDA |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philadelphia===

In 1894, the Starr Center Association in Philadelphia began serving penny lunches in one school, later expanding the service to another. Soon a lunch committee was established within the Home and School League, and lunches were extended to include nine schools in the city.&lt;ref name="EarlyPrograms" /&gt;

In 1909, Dr. Cheesman A. Herrick, who was principal of the William Penn High School for Girls was credited with accomplishing the transfer of responsibilities for operation and support of the lunch program from charitable organizations to the Philadelphia School Board. He requested that a system be established to assure that the lunches served would be based upon sound principles of nutrition and required that the program be under the direction of a home economics graduate. The Board granted his request on an experimental basis and on the condition that the program would be self-supporting. The experiment proved successful, and the following year lunch services were extended to the Southern Manual Training School and later to three additional units.&lt;ref name="EarlyPrograms" /&gt;

In the spring of 1912, the School Board established a Department of High School Lunches and directed that the food services be inaugurated in all the high schools of the city. During all this time the Home and School League had continued operating the feeding program in the nine elementary schools, and continued to do so until May 1915, when it reported to the Board that the need for a lunch system had been clearly demonstrated and that it could not be successfully operated by an organization outside the school system. As a result, the School Board placed the operation of both high school and elementary lunch programs under the supervision of the Department of High School Lunches and authorized the extension of the program to other elementary schools.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Smedley, The School Lunch: Its Organization and Management in Philadelphia, Smedley, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boston===

In September 1908, the Women's Educational and Industrial Union in Boston begun to supply hot lunches to high schools which were under the supervision of the Boston School Committee.A central kitchen system was used and lunches were transported to the participating schools.&lt;ref name="EarlyPrograms" /&gt;

In January 1910, an experimental program for elementary schools took the form of a mid-morning lunch prepared by the class in Home Economics three days each week. On two days of each week sandwiches and milk were served. The children ate their meals at their desks, there being no lunchroom in the building. Before the end of the school year (1909–10) five additional schools were benefiting from the program, and a total of 2,000 pupils were being served each day, according to a report submitted by Ellen H. Richards in the "Journal of Home Economics" for December 1910.&lt;ref name="EarlyPrograms" /&gt;

== Early supports ==

===Early federal aid===

As the scope of the meal supply expanded, local governments and school district boards could not provide the funds necessary to carry the increasing load. Supplementary contributions by charitable organizations and individuals did not suffice. Aid from Federal sources became inevitable. The earliest Federal aid came from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in 1932 and 1933 when it granted loans to several towns in southwestern Missouri to cover the cost of labor employed in preparing and serving school lunches. Such Federal assistance was expanded to other areas in 1933 and 1934 under the operations of the Civil Works Administration and the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, reaching into 39 States and covering the employment of 7,442 women.&lt;ref name="EarlyFederalAid"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Gordon W. Gunderson |title=National School Lunch Program: Early Federal Aid |url=https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp/history_4 |publisher=USDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commodity Donation Program===

The depression of the 1930s brought on widespread unemployment. Much of the production of the farm went begging for a market, surpluses of farm products continued to mount, prices of farm products declined to a point where farm income provided only a meager subsistence. Millions of school children were unable to pay for their school lunches, and with but limited family resources to provide meals at home, the danger of malnutrition among children became a national concern.&lt;ref name="EarlyFederalAid" /&gt;

Public Law 320 passed by the 74th Congress and approved August 24, 1936, made available to the Secretary of Agriculture an amount of money equal to 30 percent of the gross receipts from duties collected under the customs laws during each calendar year.&lt;ref name="EarlyFederalAid" /&gt;

Needy families and school lunch programs became constructive outlets for the commodities purchased by the USDA under the terms of such legislation. Many needy school children could not afford to pay for lunches and were sorely in need of supplementary foods from a nutritional standpoint. Thus they would be using foods at school which would not otherwise be purchased in the market place and farmers would be helped by obtaining an outlet for their products at a reasonable price. The purchase and distribution program was assigned in 1935 to the Federal Surplus Commodities Corporation which had been established in 1933 as the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation to distribute surplus pork, dairy products, and wheat to the needy. These funds came from customs duties and were specifically designated to encourage agricultural surplus consumption via exports and domestic donations. In March 1937, there were 3,839 schools receiving commodities for lunch programs serving 342,031 children daily. Two years later, the number of schools participating had grown to 14,075 and the number of children had risen to 892,259. From 1939 to 1942，the number of schools participating increased by 78,841, and the number of pupils participating increased by 5,272,540.&lt;ref name="EarlyFederalAid" /&gt;

In July 1943, in an attempt to salvage the deterioration of school lunches, Congress passed Public Law 129 to amend the Agricultural Act of 1935. This law re-established school lunch programs using $60 million to cover the purchase of food, but not labor. The next year, Congress appropriated another $50 million and allowed child-care centers to participate.&lt;ref name="EarlyFederalAid" /&gt;

Since the Act passed, Congress has modified several aspects of the policy. Congress amended the NSLP in 1962 to adjust fund distribution. They decided that the budget allocated to each state should be influenced by the state's need for further assistance. Rather than just factoring in the number of participants, Congress took into account the state poverty level compared to the national poverty level. Then, in 1968, Congress improved the NSLP food options to accommodate students with special dietary needs.&lt;ref name="fns.usda.gov"&gt;http://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp/history&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, in 2012, First Lady Michelle Obama took on the issue of school lunches. Changes that she initiated primarily focused on more specific nutritional requirements. The changes include updated food group nutrition standards, such as vegetable subgroups, re-adjusted meat and grain serving sizes to reflect different school grade ranges, an implemented requirement for whole grains, and milk-fat restrictions. Lower calorie ranges and a 10-year progressive sodium reduction plan also started in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comparison of Previous and Current Regulatory Requirements under Final Rule “Nutrition Standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs” |url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/comparison.pdf |publisher=USDA |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140715145354/http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/comparison.pdf |archivedate=July 15, 2014 |date=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Where the food comes from ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Any school is eligible to receive NSLP for its students; meals come from a number of different sources, they can come from on-site production, vended meal from a NSLP caterer or in most schools provided by the local school board centralized kitchen.

This is usually regulated by each state's Department of Education's nutrition services. Regardless of who provides the food (on-site production, catered-vended, or school board kitchen), the raw materials come from USDA as donated commodities; in the case of vended meals, the caterer must use and credit the school for the commodities received.

== Food safety ==
Driven to increase the quality of food in the NSLP, the [[USDA]] [[Agricultural Marketing Service]] (AMS) undertook an ambitious agenda to provide schools with a consistent supply of safe, low-fat [[ground beef]]. Beginning in 2002, AMS established a statistically based vendor certification and [[supply chain]] quality management program for the purchase of ground beef and pork for NSLP under the Technical Requirements Schedule (GB‑2006, the current version). The program has enjoyed considerable success in reducing pathogen levels and controlling fat content in lean beef and [[pork]] that is provided to school children.

Under the program, Meat Grading and Certification (MGC) Branch agents enforce [[continuous auditing]] and in-plant monitoring as long as the contractor is in the program. Microbial and fat SPC charts and graphs for microbial levels and fat content are monitored for process assessment purposes on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwasoft.com/appnotes/amsnslp.htm ''Delivering the "Stats" for National School Lunch Quality and Safety'' Jeff Cawley]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Citation style|section|date=November 2014|details=Inline external links as citations should use the ref tag}}
Nutrition standards for the National School Lunch Program and National School Breakfast program were updated in 2012.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} This update in nutritional standards was funded through a federal statute signed into law by President Barack Obama. The bill called the [[Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010]] funds free lunch programs in public schools for the next five years. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CHILD NUTRITION REAUTHORIZATION HEALTHY, HUNGER-FREE KIDS ACT OF 2010 |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/Child_Nutrition_Fact_Sheet_12_10_10.pdf |website=whitehouse.gov |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121224451/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/Child_Nutrition_Fact_Sheet_12_10_10.pdf |archivedate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new guidelines require students to choose either a serving of fruit or vegetables every meal. Also, the portions must now be larger. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last= Datz|first= Todd|date= |title= New school meal standards significantly increase fruit, vegetable consumption|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/school-meal-standards-increase-fruit-and-vegetable-consumption/ |location= |publisher= [[Harvard School of Public Health]]|agency= |access-date=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with larger portions of fruits and vegetables, the National School Lunch Program now enforces a variety of other nutritional requirements. Food products and ingredients used to prepare school meals must contain zero grams of added [[trans fat]] per serving (less than 0.5 grams per serving as defined by FDA). Furthermore, a meal can provide no more than 30 percent of calories from fat and less than 10 percent from [[saturated fat]].[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-01-26/pdf/2012-1010.pdf]

In late 2009, the [[Institute of Medicine of the National Academies]] released ''School Meals: Building Blocks For Healthy Children''.&lt;ref&gt;National Academy of Sciences. 2009. School Meals: Building Blocks For Healthy Children. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. Available at:http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12751.&lt;/ref&gt; This report reviews and provides recommendations to update the nutrition standard and the meal requirements for the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program. ''School Meals'' also sets standards for menu planning that focus on food groups, calories, saturated fat, and sodium, and that incorporate Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Dietary Reference Intakes.

Nutrition plays a critical role in cognitive development and academic performance for children; undernourished children are more likely to be less energetic and less able to concentrate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCary | first1 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Improving Access to School-Based Nutrition Services for Children with Special Health Care Needs | url = | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 106 | issue = 9| pages = 1333–1336 | doi=10.1016/j.jada.2006.07.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day-to-day observation of teachers and administrators of the relationship between inadequate nutrition and behavior and ability to learn is substantiated by scientific studies. Twenty [[Cape Town]], South Africa, children were studied for 11 years, beginning in 1955.-The study was based on the hypothesis "that the ill effects of under-nutrition are determined by (1) its occurrence during the period of maximum growth and (2) the duration of under-nutrition relative to the total period of growth. . . Evidence is cumulative and impressive that severe under-nutrition during the first 2 years of life, when [[brain]] growth is most active, results in a permanent reduction of brain size and restricted intellectual development." &lt;ref&gt;Undernutrition During Infancy, and Subsequent Brain Growth and Intellectual Development from Malnutrition, Learning and Behavior.

== Controversy ==
In December 2009, a report was released that showed that [[fast food restaurant]]s were far more rigorous in checking for [[bacteria]] and dangerous [[pathogen]]s in [[beef]] and [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] than the school lunch program. "We simply are not giving our kids in schools the same level of quality and safety as you get when you go to many fast-food restaurants," said J.&amp;nbsp;Glenn Morris, director of the [[Emerging Pathogens Institute]] at the [[University of Florida]]. "We are not using those same standards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In November 2011, an agriculture appropriations bill passed by [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] garnered controversy for blocking a proposed change by the Obama administration to school lunch regulations, whereby 1/8 cup of tomato paste would no longer have been considered as having the nutritional equivalent of 1/2 a cup of vegetables, but instead only as having the nutritional equivalent of 1/8 cup of vegetables (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;schools can only credit a volume of vegetables as equivalent to its actual size). Critics of this move by Congress claim that pressure was placed upon officials voting on the bill by [[lobbying|lobbyist]]s representing [[pizza]] manufacturers and [[cheese]] producers, as it was seen to threaten the ability of schools to serve pizza and credit it with the same level of nutritional value as they heretofore had.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Many critics have sardonically summarized the situation as "Pizza is now a vegetable" or "Congress decides pizza is a vegetable".{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} However, others have pointed out that 1/8 cup of tomato paste stacks up remarkably well against a 1/2 cup of vegetables nutritionally, albeit with an excessive amount of sodium that could be argued to reduce its nutritional value.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Public concern===

In 1967–68, the national enrollment in public and private schools was approximately 50.7 million, according to a survey of School Food Services in March 1968. About 36.8 million children, or 73 percent, were enrolled in schools participating in the National School Lunch Program with an actual average participation in the program of 18.9 million children, or about 37 percent of the national enrollment.&lt;ref name="PublicConcern"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Gordon W. Gunderson |title=National School Lunch Program: Public Concern, Action and Status |url=https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp/history_7 |publisher=USDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons for non-participation in the program were numerous but, in low-income areas and large urban centers, low participation was particularly evident. Many of the school buildings in these areas, as well as the small schools in rural areas, were built many years before there were plans for operating a school lunch program, and the buildings did not lend themselves to remodeling for that purpose - neither were local funds available for it. Many of the elementary school buildings in urban centers were built with the idea that the children could and should go home for lunch ("neighborhood schools") and lunchroom facilities were not available. Many of these conditions hold true today.&lt;ref name="PublicConcern" /&gt;

Some school authorities hold to the idea that a school lunch program must be self-supporting, and others feel that the school has no responsibility in this area. According to a junior high school principal, "We think this is the responsibility of parents and child. We do not check them to see if a student eats. As a whole, we are doing it as a service rather than a need."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Fairfax, Chairman. Committee on School Lunch Participation, Their Daily Bread, Atlanta, Ga., McNelley-Rudd Printing Service, Inc., p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The net result is that the children in the neediest areas must go without an adequate noonday meal at school, or perhaps an inadequate evening meal at home, or none at all. Many high school students prefer to bring a bag lunch from home or eat snacks and beverages at a nearby stand or from a [[vending machine]] in the school. In some instances the portions served to high school students are not adjusted to meet their needs and they seek other sources of service where their tastes and appetites can be satisfied.&lt;ref name="PublicConcern" /&gt;

The predominate reason, however, appears to be inadequate funding at federal, state and local levels, with the end result that the children who cannot afford to pay are the losers.&lt;ref name="PublicConcern" /&gt;

=== Native Americans and children of color ===

In December 2014, ''[[Indian Country Today]]'' reported that 68 percent of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[Alaska Natives|Alaska Native]] students "are eligible for free and reduced-price school lunches, compared with 28 percent of [[White American|white]] students. USDA data indicate that 70 percent of children receiving free lunches through the NSLP are children of color, as are 50 percent of students receiving reduced-price lunches."&lt;ref name = "lee"&gt;{{Cite news

==Current challenges==

The current challenges of the NSLP can be broken down into three major categories: caloric and nutritional needs, food waste, and rising costs.

===Caloric and nutritional needs===

For some time, the measurement from which the NSLP based its cash-reimbursements and meal provisions largely came from caloric requirements. However, while this worked in a time where [[malnutrition]] plagued the nation's poverty, the modern focus on caloric intake usurps the nation's stance on the growing obesity epidemic. Balancing nutrition and calories has always been a challenge for the NSLP and its participating schools. This struggle can undermine schools that wish to comply with the national standards while still advocating healthy lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Baker |first1=Al |title=Lunch Trays Got Too Lean in City’s Fight Against Fat |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/nyregion/calories-in-some-nyc-school-lunches-were-below-federal-requirements.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |accessdate=October 10, 2018 |work=New York Times |date=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem that contributes to this challenge is that nutritious food is often considered less favorable than competitive food that is available to students. Given the choice, students will often prefer competitive foods that are not required to meet federal minimum nutrition standards.&lt;ref name="ERICdescribesNSLP"&gt;{{cite web |title=The National School Lunch Program |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED502404 |website=ERIC |publisher=USDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competitive foods===

In the US, the term ''competitive foods'' refers to any food source that competes with a lunch program's offerings.  Such competitive foods include fast food offerings, [[a la carte]] food lines, and vending machines.&lt;ref name=Schneider2012&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A study was done in the 2009-2010 school year across 47 states and 622 districts to examine how much of districts' competitive food and drink policy complied with [[Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion|Dietary Guidelines for Americans]] (DGA) recommendations.&lt;ref name=Schneider2012/&gt; One of the major reasons for this study to be done is the [[Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010|Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act]] which requires schools to establish a science-based nutrition standards for competitive foods called a wellness plan. These new provisions for competitive food and drinks included limits on specific nutrients in the food, such as sodium and fats.&lt;ref name=Schneider2012/&gt; Unfortunately, less than 5% of districts met or exceeded DGA requirements.&lt;ref name=Schneider2012/&gt; Only about 4% of districts across the nation required fruits and vegetables to be sold within the competitive foods which in no way helps the fruit and vegetable intake of students that is already sub-par.&lt;ref name=Schneider2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/nutrition/standards.htm |title=CDC - Nutrition - Competitive Foods in Schools - Adolescent and School Health |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/tags/competitive-foods |title=Competitive Foods &amp;#124; Food and Nutrition Service |publisher=Fns.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bettina-elias-siegel/competitive-school-food-rules_b_2600465.html |title=Bettina Elias Siegel: USDA's New "Competitive" School Food Rules - What You Need to Know |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2013-02-04 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food waste===

Children throw away much of the nutritious food that they are served. In a study of the Boston Public Schools, "on average, students discarded roughly 19 percent of their entrées, 47 percent of their fruit, 25 percent of their milk, and 73 percent of their vegetables." "It was estimated that $432,349.05 worth of food is wasted annually at lunch by students in Grades 6–8 in [Boston Public Schools]." Overall, this sum makes up 26.1 percent of these three schools' food budgets, excluding labor and supplies. If translated nationally, Cohen estimates that roughly $1,238,846,400 in food is wasted on an annual basis. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074937971200760X | doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2012.09.060 | volume=44 | title=School Lunch Waste Among Middle School Students | journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine | pages=114–121| pmc=3788640 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One reason that students discard this amount of food has to do with à la carte lines and vending machines. In a 1998 study of 16 randomly selected schools in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], the authors discovered a negative correlation between à la carte lines, vending machine use, and fruit and vegetable consumption. On average, students from schools without an à la carte line consumed nearly an entire serving more of fruit and vegetables than did students with such programs. Furthermore, students from all schools exceeded the daily USDA recommended calories from saturated fat, and students from schools with à la carte lines exceeded the recommendations by 1 percent more, on average. Concerning snack vending machines, the authors determined that with each vending machine present, "students' mean intake of fruit servings decreased by 11 percent." Beverage machines showed no significant impact.&lt;ref&gt;http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.93.7.1168&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rising costs===

A challenge for schools that take part in the NSLP is rising costs of producing lunch. According to the School Lunch and Breakfast Cost Study (SLBCS), one in four school districts reported costs for school lunches above the program reimbursement rate.
The additional cost must then be supplemented by school district general funds, and this puts a strain on school district budgets. Additional costs also make it difficult to meet federally mandated nutrition requirements because using the best palatable foods for students becomes too expensive.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

According to the 2008 USDA report on the NSLP, "other sources of increasing costs include increases in health care costs for employees and, more recently, rising food costs."&lt;ref name="ERICdescribesNSLP" /&gt; For example, in 2008, some school systems in Alabama, California, and Texas raised meal prices to keep up with "steep increases in food costs." &lt;ref&gt;Food Research Action Center (FRAC) FRAC News Digest, April 22, 2008, http://frac.org/digest/index.htm, accessed December 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The school districts raised prices for paying students, while keeping prices the same for students that qualified for reduced-price or free lunches. This method of cost adjustment leaves either the school district or paying students to bear the burden of the price increase.

==National School Lunch Week==
National School Lunch Week takes place on the second Sunday in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/36/132- |title=36 USC § 132 - National School Lunch Week &amp;#124; Title 36 - Patriotic and National Observances, Ceremonies, and Organizations &amp;#124; U.S. Code &amp;#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=.law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 6, 2017, [[United States President|President]] [[Donald Trump]] proclaimed ''National School Lunch Week''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[White House Office of the Press Secretary|Office of the Press Secretary]]|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/10/06/president-donald-j-trump-proclaims-october-8-through-october-14|title=President Donald J.

'''Pan-Africanism''' is a worldwide movement that aims to encourage and strengthen bonds of solidarity between all people of African descent. Based on a common fate going back to the [[Atlantic slave trade]], the movement extends beyond continental Africans, with a substantial support base among the [[African diaspora in the Americas|African diaspora in the Caribbean, Latin America, and the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oloruntoba-Oju |first=Omotayo |title=Pan Africanism, Myth and History in African and Caribbean Drama |journal=[[Journal of Pan African Studies]] |volume=5 |number=8 |date=December 2012 |pages=190 ff. |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-316072934/pan-africanism-myth-and-history-in-african-and-caribbean}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the belief that unity is vital to economic, social, and political progress and aims to "unify and uplift" people of African descent.&lt;ref&gt;Frick, Janari, et al.

At its core Pan-Africanism is "a belief that [[Ethnic groups in Africa|African peoples]], both on the continent and in the [[African Diaspora|diaspora]], share not merely a common history, but a common destiny".&lt;ref&gt;Makalani, Minkah (2011), [http://exhibitions.nypl.org/africanaage/essay-pan-africanism.html "Pan-Africanism"].

The [[Organization of African Unity]] (now the [[African Union]]) was established in 1963 to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial  integrity of its Member States and to promote global relations within the framework of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.int/en/about/nutshell About the African Union] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129055921/http://www.au.int/en/about/nutshell |date=January 29, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[African Union Commission]] has its seat in [[Addis Ababa]] and the [[Pan-African Parliament]] has its seat in [[Johannesburg]] and [[Midrand]].

Crucially, an all-African alliance would empower African people globally.

The realization of the Pan-African objective would lead to "power consolidation in Africa", which "would compel a reallocation of global resources, as well as unleashing a fiercer psychological energy and political assertion...that would unsettle social and political (power) structures...in the Americas".&lt;ref name="Agyeman, O. 1998"&gt;Agyeman, O.

Advocates of Pan-Africanism—i.e. "Pan-Africans" or "Pan-Africanists"—often champion socialist principles and tend to be opposed to external political and economic involvement on the continent. Critics accuse the ideology of homogenizing the experience of people of African descent. They also point to the difficulties of reconciling current divisions within countries on the continent and within communities in the diaspora.&lt;ref name="Agyeman, O. 1998"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref name="Agyeman [in] Mawere"&gt;Agyeman, O., ''Pan-Africanism and Its Detractors: A Response to Harvard's Race Effacing Universalists'', Havard University Press (Havard) (1998)) [in] Mawere, Munyaradzi; Mubaya, Tapuwa R.; ''African Philosophy and Thought Systems: A Search for a Culture and Philosophy of Belonging'', Langaa RPCIG (2016), p. 89. {{ISBN|9789956763016}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SrqACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89] (last retrieved 23 Aug 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Invitation to Pan-African Conference at Westminster Town Hall July 1900.png|thumb|Invitation to [[First Pan-African Conference|Pan-African Conference]] at Westminster Town Hall, London, July 1900]]
As a philosophy, Pan-Africanism represents the aggregation of the historical, cultural, spiritual, artistic, scientific, and philosophical legacies of Africans from past times to the present. Pan-Africanism as an ethical system traces its origins from ancient times, and promotes values that are the product of the African civilisations and the struggles against [[slavery]], [[racism]], [[colonialism]], and [[neo-colonialism]].&lt;ref name="Pan-Africanism"/&gt;

Alongside a large number of slaves insurrections, by the end of the 18th century a political movement developed across the Americas, [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] that sought to weld disparate movements into a network of solidarity, putting an end to oppression. Another important political form of a religious Pan-Africanist worldview appeared in the form of [[Ethiopianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exhibitions.nypl.org/africanaage/essay-pan-africanism.html|title=Pan-Africanism|website=exhibitions.nypl.org|access-date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[London]], the [[Sons of Africa]] was a political group addressed by [[Quobna Ottobah Cugoano]] in the 1791 edition of his book ''Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil of Slavery''. The group addressed meetings and organised letter-writing campaigns, published campaigning material and visited [[parliament]]. They wrote to figures such as [[Granville Sharp]], [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] and other members of the [[white people|white]] [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition]] movement, as well as King [[George III]] and the [[Prince of Wales]], the future [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]].

Modern Pan-Africanism began around the start of the 20th century. The African Association, later renamed the [[Pan-African Association]], was established around 1897 by [[Henry Sylvester-Williams]], who organized the [[First Pan-African Conference]] in London in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newint.org/features/2000/08/05/simply/ "A history of Pan-Africanism"], ''New Internationalist'', 326, August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The History of Pan-Africanism"&gt;[http://www.padeap.net/the-history-of-pan-africanism The History of Pan Africanism], PADEAP (Pan African Development Education and Advocacy Programme).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lubin, Alex, [https://books.google.com/books?id=97VMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=%22African+Association%22+1897+pan-african+association&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-L0W5n8PxM&amp;sig=W3WaUfJOnOtOwoa07HzP3to1xRg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjH_9nHg_fLAhWMbRQKHaZzC5AQ6AEIcjAR#v=onepage&amp;q=%22African%20Association%22%201897%20pan-african%20association&amp;f=false "The Contingencies of Pan-Africanism"], ''Geographies of Liberation: The Making of an Afro-Arab Political Imaginary'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2014, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the independence of [[Ghana]] in March 1957, Kwame Nkrumah was elected as the first Prime Minister and President of the State.&lt;ref&gt;Smith-Asante, E., [http://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/biography-of-ghana-s-first-president-dr-kwame-nkrumah.html "Biography of Ghana’s first President, Dr Kwame Nkrumah"], ''Graphic Online'', 8 March 2016. Retrieved March 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Nkrumah emerged as a major advocate for the unity of Independent Africa. The Ghanaian President embodied a political activist approach to pan-Africanism as he championed the “quest for regional integration of the whole of the African continent”.&lt;ref name="books.google.fr"&gt;Mkandawire, P. (2005). [https://books.google.fr/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=4VIAfPNTOkQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=ben+bella+and+pan+africanism&amp;ots=XVOy8XvQBT&amp;sig=VC1jsL4_uaxZp6MGKZPFtsNWNkg#v=onepage&amp;q=nkrumah&amp;f=false ''African Intellectuals: Rethinking Politics, Language, Gender and Development''], Dakar: Codesria/London: Zed Books, p. 58. Retrieved March 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This period represented a "Golden Age of high pan-African ambitions"; the Continent had experienced revolution and decolonization from Western powers and the narrative of rebirth and solidarity had gained momentum within the pan-African movement.&lt;ref name="books.google.fr"/&gt; Nkrumah’s pan-African principles intended for a union between the Independent African states upon a recognition of their commonality (i.e. suppression under imperialism). Pan-Africanism under Nkrumah evolved past the assumptions of a racially exclusive movement associated with black Africa, and adopted a political discourse of regional unity &lt;ref name="Legum, C. 1965 p. 41"&gt;Legum, C. (1965). ''Pan-Africanism: a short political guide'', New York, etc.: Frederick A. Praeger, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1958, Nkrumah hosted the first All-African People’s Conference (AAPC) in [[Accra]], Ghana. The Conference invited delegates of political movements and major political leaders. With the exception of South Africa, all Independent States of the Continent attended: Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Liberia, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia and Sudan.&lt;ref name="Legum, C. 1965 p. 41"/&gt; The Conference signified a monumental event in the pan-African movement, as it revealed a political and social union between those considered Arabic states and the black African regions. Further, the Conference espoused a common African Nationalist identity, among the States, of unity and anti-Imperialism. [[Frantz Fanon]], journalist, freedom fighter and a member of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Algerian FLN]] party attended the conference as a delegate for Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;Adi, H., &amp; M. Sherwood (2003). ''Pan-African History: Political Figures from Africa and the Diaspora Since 1787'', London: Routledge, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the armed struggle of the FLN against French colonial rule, the attendees of the Conference agreed to support the struggle of those States under colonial oppression. This encouraged the commitment of direct involvement in the "emancipation of the Continent; thus, a fight against colonial pressures on South Africa was declared and the full support of the FLN struggle in Algeria, against French colonial rule"”.&lt;ref name="Legum, C. 1965 p. 42"&gt;Legum (1965). ''Pan-Africanism'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following 1958, Accra Conference also marked the establishment of a new foreign policy of non-alignment as between the US and USSR, and the will to found an "African Identity" in global affairs by advocating a unity between the African States on international relations. "This would be based on the Bandung Declaration, the Charter of the UN and on loyalty to UN decisions."&lt;ref name="Legum, C. 1965 p. 42"/&gt;

In 1959, Nkrumah, President Sékou Touré of Guinea and President William Tubman of Liberia met at [[Sanniquellie]] and signed the Sanniquellie Declaration outlining the principles for the achievement of the unity of Independent African States whilst maintaining a national identity and autonomous constitutional structure.&lt;ref&gt;Adi &amp; Sherwood (2003). ''Pan-African History'', p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legum (1965), ''Pan-Africanism'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Declaration called for a revised understanding of pan-Africanism and the uniting of the Independent States. In 1960, the second All-African People’s Conference was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Legum (1965). ''Pan-Africanism'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The membership of the All-African People’s Organisation (AAPO) had increased with the inclusion of the “Algerian Provisional Government (as they had not yet won independence), Cameroun, Guinea, Nigeria, Somalia and the United Arab Republic”.&lt;ref&gt;Legum (1965), ''Pan-Africanism'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The Conference highlighted diverging ideologies within the movement, as Nkrumah’s call for a political and economic union between the Independent African States gained little agreement. The disagreements following 1960 gave rise to two rival factions within the pan-African movement: the Casablanca Bloc and the Brazzaville Bloc.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, G. (2012). ''African Political Thought'', New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Algeria gained independence from French colonial rule and Ahmed Ben Bella assumed Presidency. Ben Bella was a strong advocate for pan-Africanism and an African Unity. Following the FLN’s armed struggle for liberation, Ben Bella spoke at the UN and espoused for Independent Africa’s role in providing military and financial support to the African liberation movements opposing apartheid and fighting Portuguese colonialism.&lt;ref name="Adi 2003 p. 10"&gt;Adi &amp; Sherwood (2003), ''Pan-African History'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In search of a united voice, in 1963 at an African Summit conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 32 African states met and established the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU). The creation of the OAU Charter took place at this Summit and defines a coordinated "effort to raise the standard of living of member States and defend their sovereignty" by supporting freedom fighters and decolonisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/25/newsid_2502000/2502771.stm "African states unite against white rule"], ''ON THIS DAY'' | May25. BBC News. Retrieved March 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, was the formation of the African Liberation Committee (ALC), during the 1963 Summit. Championing the support of liberation movements, was Algeria’s President Ben Bella, immediately “donated 100 million francs to its finances and was one of the first countries, of the Organisation to boycott Portuguese and South African goods”.&lt;ref name="Adi 2003 p. 10"/&gt;

In 1969, Algiers hosted the [[Festival panafricain d’Alger 1969|Pan-African Cultural Festival]], on July 21 and it continued for 10 days.&lt;ref name=EvansPhillips&gt;Evans, M., &amp; J.

It symbolised the new pan-African identity, of regions with a shared experience of colonisation. The Festival further strengthened Algeria’s President, Boumediene’s standing in Africa and the Third World.&lt;ref name=EvansPhillips /&gt;

After the death of Kwame Nkrumah in 1972, Muammar Qaddafi assumed the mantle of leader of the Pan-Africanist movement and became the most outspoken advocate of African Unity, consistently calling – like Nkrumah before him – for the advent of a "United States of Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/African_Political_Thought.html?id=rqYEhtONIBgC|title=African Political Thought|last=Martin|first=G.|date=December 23, 2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137062055|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- {{Primary inline|date=October 2015}}{{Self-published inline|date=October 2015}}--&gt;

In the [[United States]], the term is closely associated with [[Afrocentrism]], an ideology of [[African-American]] [[identity politics]] that emerged during the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1960s to 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Ronald W. Walters, ''Pan Africanism in the African Diaspora: An Analysis of Modern Afrocentric Political Movements'', African American Life Series, Wayne State University Press, 1997, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:Pan Africanism mural in Tanzania.jpg|thumb|A mural in [[Ujiji]], [[Tanzania]]]]
As originally conceived by [[Henry Sylvester-Williams]] (although some historians{{who|date=July 2018}} credit the idea to [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]]), Pan-Africanism referred to the unity of all continental Africa.&lt;ref name="Sculpting a Pan-African Culture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpanafrican.com/docs/vol1no6/SculptingaPanAfricanCultureInArtOfNegritude_vol1no6.pdf|title=Sculpting a Pan-African Culture in the Art of Négritude: A Model for African Artist|date=December 2006|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601150556/http://www.jpanafrican.com/docs/vol1no6/SculptingaPanAfricanCultureInArtOfNegritude_vol1no6.pdf|archive-date=June 1, 2015|dead-url=bot: unknown|access-date=|first=Crystal Z.|last= Campbell|journal=The Journal of Pan African Studies|volume=1|issue=6|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

During [[apartheid]] South Africa there was a [[Pan Africanist Congress]] that dealt with the oppression of Africans in South Africa under Apartheid rule. Other pan-Africanist organisations include: [[Marcus Garvey|Garvey]]'s [[Universal Negro Improvement Association|Universal Negro Improvement Association-African Communities League]], TransAfrica and the [[Uhuru Movement|International People's Democratic Uhuru Movement]].

Additionally, Pan-Africanism is seen as an endeavor to return to what are deemed by its proponents as singular, traditional African concepts about culture, society, and values. Examples of this include [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]]'s [[Négritude]] movement, and [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]'s view of [[Authenticité (Zaire)|Authenticité]].

An important theme running through much pan-Africanist literature concerns the historical links between different countries on the continent, and the benefits of cooperation as a way of resisting imperialism and colonialism.

In the 21st century, some Pan-Africanists aim to address [[globalisation]] and the problems of [[environmental injustice|environmental justice]]. For instance, at the conference  "Pan-Africanism for a New Generation"&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordafrican.wordpress.com/ Oxford University African Society Conference, Corpus Christi College, Oxford University], May 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; held at the [[University of Oxford]], June 2011, Ledum Mittee, the current president of the [[Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People|Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP)]], argued that environmental justice movements across the African continent should create horizontal linkages in order to better protect the interests of threatened peoples and the ecological systems in which they are embedded, and upon which their survival depends.

Some universities went as far as creating "Departments of Pan-African Studies" in the late 1960s. This includes the [[California State University]], where that department was founded in 1969 as a direct reaction to the [[civil rights movement]], and is today dedicated to "teaching students about the African World Experience", to "demonstrate to the campus and the community the richness, vibrance, diversity, and vitality of African, African American, and Caribbean cultures" and to "presenting students and the community with an Afrocentric analysis" of anti-black [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csus.edu/pas/About%20Us.html#quickLinks |title=About Us |publisher=Csus.edu |date= |accessdate=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Syracuse University]] also offers a [[Department of African American Studies - Syracuse University#Pan African Studies|master's degree in "Pan African Studies]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://aas.syr.edu/graduate/ The M.A. in Pan African Studies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025115454/http://aas.syr.edu/graduate/ |date=2014-10-25 }}, African American Studies at Syracuse University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flags of numerous states in Africa and of Pan-African groups use green, yellow and red. This colour combination was originally adopted from the 1897 [[flag of Ethiopia]], and was inspired by the fact that [[Ethiopia]] is the continent's oldest independent nation.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=EFhAUbH6ra0C|title=Flag Lore of All Nations|last1=Smith|first1=Whitney|date=2001|publisher=Millbrook Press|isbn=0761317538|page=36|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus making the Ethiopian green, yellow and red the closest visual representation of Pan-Africanism. This is in comparison to the  Black Nationalist flag, representing political theory centred around the eugenicist [[Casta|caste]] stratified colonial Americas. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lionel K.|first=McPherson|last2=Shelby|first2=Tommie|date=Spring 2004|title=Blackness and Blood: Interpreting African American Identity|url=http://web.mit.edu/sgrp/2005/no1/McPhersonShelbyBB.pdf|journal=Philosophy and Public Affairs|volume=32|pages=171-192|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|UNIA]] (Universal Negro Improvement Association) flag, is a tri-color [[flag]] consisting of three equal horizontal bands of (from top down) [[red]], [[black]] and [[green]].

[[Pan-African flag#Derivative flags|Variations of the flag]] have been used in various countries and territories in [[Africa]] and the [[Americas]] to represent Black Nationalist ideologies. Among these are the flags of [[Flag of Malawi|Malawi]], [[Flag of Kenya|Kenya]] and [[Flag of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Saint Kitts and Nevis]]. Several Pan-African organizations and movements have also often employed the emblematic red, black and green tri-color scheme in variety of contexts.

Probably the most successful campaign of the Council was for South African famine relief in 1946. The CAA was hopeful that, following [[World War II]], there would be a move towards [[Third World]] independence under the trusteeship of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="Duberman 296-297"&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''Paul Robeson'', 1989, pp. 296–97.&lt;/ref&gt; To the CAA's dismay, the proposals introduced by the U.S. government to the conference in April/May 1945 set no clear limits on the duration of colonialism and no motions towards allowing territorial possessions to move towards self-government.&lt;ref name="Duberman 296-297" /&gt; Liberal supporters abandoned the CAA, and the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] cracked down on its operations. In 1953 the CAA was charged with subversion under the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]]. Its principal leaders, including Robeson, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], and Alphaeus Hunton (1903–70), were subjected to harassment, indictments, and in the case of Hunton, imprisonment. Under the weight of internal disputes, government repression, and financial hardships, the Council on African Affairs disbanded in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanactivist.msu.edu/organization.php?name=Council+on+African+Affairs "Council on African Affairs"], [[African Activist Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[US Organization]] was founded in 1965 by [[Maulana Karenga]], following the [[Watts riots]]. It is based on the synthetic [[African philosophy]] of kawaida, and is perhaps best known for creating [[Kwanzaa]] and the ''Nguzo Saba'' ("seven principles"). In the words of its founder and chair, Karenga, "the essential task of our organization Us has been and remains to provide a philosophy, a set of principles and a program which inspires a personal and social practice that not only satisfies human need but transforms people in the process, making them self-conscious agents of their own life and liberation".&lt;ref name="The US Organization"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us-organization.org/30th/ppp.html|title=Philosophy, Principles, and Program|website=The Organization Us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pan-African concepts and philosophies==
===Afrocentric Pan-Africanism===
[[Afrocentric]] Pan-Africanism is espoused by Kwabena Faheem Ashanti in his book ''The Psychotechnology of Brainwashing: Crucifying Willie Lynch''. Another newer movement that has evolved from the early Afrocentric school is the Afrisecal movement or Afrisecaism of Francis Ohanyido, a Nigerian philosopher-poet.&lt;ref name="Bio Ohanyido"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africaresource.com/djelia/poetry/173-francis-okechukwu-ohanyido|publisher= African Resource|title= Francis Okechukwu Ohanyido}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black Nationalism]] is sometimes associated with this form of pan-Africanism.

===Hip Hop===
During the past three decades [[hip hop]] has emerged as a powerful force that has partly shaped black identity worldwide. In his 2005 article "Hip-hop Turns 30: Whatcha Celebratin' For?", [[Greg Tate]] describes hip-hop culture as the product of a Pan-African state of mind. It is an "ethnic enclave/empowerment zone that has served as a foothold for the poorest among us to get a grip on the land of the prosperous".&lt;ref&gt;Tate, Greg, "Hip-hop Turns 30: Whatcha Celebratin' For?", ''[[Village Voice]]'', 4 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Hip-hop unifies those of African descent globally in its movement towards greater economic, social and political power. Andreana Clay in her article "Keepin' it Real: Black Youth, Hip-Hop Culture, and Black Identity" states that hip-hop provides the world with "vivid illustrations of Black lived experience", creating bonds of black identity across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Clay, Andreana. "Keepin' it Real: Black Youth, Hip-Hop Culture, and Black Identity". In ''American Behavioral Scientist'', Vol. 46.10 (2003): 1346–1358.&lt;/ref&gt; Hip hop authenticates a black identity, and in doing so, creates a unifying uplifting force among Africans as Pan-Africanism sets out to achieve.

==Versus majority==
In international institutional law, a "simple majority" (also a "[[Majority#Majority vote|majority]]") vote is more than half of the votes cast (disregarding abstentions) ''among'' alternatives; a "qualified majority" (also a "[[supermajority]]") is a number of votes above a specified percentage (e.g. two-thirds); a "relative majority" (also a "plurality") is the number of votes obtained that is greater than any other option; and an "absolute majority" is a number of votes "greater than the number of votes that possibly can be obtained at the same time for any other solution",&lt;ref name=Example group=Notes&gt;For example, 50 voters elect six office holders from a field of 11 candidates, thereby casting 300 votes. The largest ''absolute majority'' in this scenario would be 50 voters casting all their ballots for the same six candidates, which at 300 votes would be substantially higher than the ''simple majority'' of 151 votes—a result that no individual candidate can achieve, since the most votes any one can receive is 50. With the smallest absolute majority in this scenario, the six winners would receive 28 votes each, totaling 168, and the [[Runner-up|runners-up]] would receive either 27 or 26 votes each.&lt;/ref&gt; when voting for ''multiple'' alternatives at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schermers|first1=Henry G.|last2=Blokker|first2=Niels M.|title= International Institutional Law: Unity Within Diversity|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|edition=5|date=2011|location=|pages=|isbn=9004187987|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMXToQLp21UC&amp;pg=PA562&amp;dq=relative+majority&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie2e6YwILKAhXKJh4KHS3uC7sQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=relative%20majority&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Absolute group=Notes&gt;An "absolute majority" can also mean a "[[Supermajority#Majority of the entire membership|majority of the entire membership]]", a [[voting basis]] that requires that more than half of ''all'' the members of a body (including those absent and those present but not voting) to vote in favour of a proposition in order for it to be passed.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Watson Fowler]] suggests that the American terms "plurality" and "majority" offer single-word alternatives for the corresponding two-word terms in British English, "relative majority" and "absolute majority", and that in British English "majority" is sometimes understood to mean "receiving the most votes" and can therefore be confused with "plurality".&lt;ref name="Fowler1965"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Henry Watson|author-link=Henry Watson Fowler|title=[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=2|date=1965|location=Oxford|pages=725|language=|isbn=0199535345}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fowler group=Notes&gt;
"With three-cornered contests as common as they now are, we may have occasion to find a convenient single word for what we used to call an ''absolute majority''... In America the word ''majority'' itself has that meaning while a poll greater than that of any other candidate, but less than half the votes cast is called a ''plurality.'' It might be useful to borrow this distinction..." —Henry Watson Fowler&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Poundstone]] observes that systems which allow choosing by a plurality of votes are more vulnerable to the [[spoiler effect]]—where two or more similar choices each draw fewer votes than a dissimilar choice that would have lost to any individual similar choice on its own—than systems which require a majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poundstone|first=William|author-link=|title=Gaming the Vote: Why Elections Aren't Fair (and What We Can Do About It)|publisher=Macmillan|url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=hbxL3A-pWagC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Plurality+poundstone+%22why+elections+aren't+fair%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgns2Qq4bKAhUGWSYKHWTwCnMQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=plurality&amp;f=false|volume=|edition= |date=2009|location=New York|pages=352|language=|isbn=9781429957649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Party politics}}

A '''political party''' is an organized group of people, often with common views, who come together to contest [[election]]s and hold power in the government. The party agrees on some proposed policies and programmes, with a view to promoting the collective good or furthering their supporters' interests.

While there is some international commonality in the way political parties are recognized and in how they operate, there are often many differences, and some are significant. Many political parties have an ideological core, but some do not, and many represent ideologies very different from their ideology at the time the party was founded. Many countries, such as Germany and India, have several significant political parties, and some nations have [[one-party state|one-party systems]], such as China and Cuba. The United States is in practice a [[two-party system]] but with many smaller parties also participating and a high degree of autonomy for individual candidates.

==Historical dimensions==

===Political factions===
[[Political faction|Political factions]] have existed in democratic societies since ancient times. [[Plato]] writes in his ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' on the formation of political [[clique|cliques]] in [[Classical Athens]], and the tendency of Athenian citizens to vote according to [[partisanship|factional loyalty]] rather than for the [[civic virtue|public good]]. In the [[Roman Republic]], [[Polybius]] coined the term ''[[ochlocracy]]'' (literally, 'rule of the mob') to describe the tendency of politicians to mobilise popular factionalist sentiment against their political rivals. Factional politics remained a part of Roman political life through the [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] period and beyond, and the poet [[Juvenal]] coined the phrase "[[bread and circuses]]" to describe the political class pandering to the citizenry through diversionary entertainments rather than through arguments about policy. "Bread and circuses" survived as part of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] political life - for example, the [[Nika revolt]] during the reign of [[Justinian]] was a riot between the "Blues" and the "Greens" -- two [[chariot racing]] factions at the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]], who received patronage from different [[Byzantine Senate|Senatorial factions]] and [[History of Eastern Orthodox theology|religious sects]]. The patricians who sponsored the Blues and the Greens competed with each other to hold ever grander games and public entertainments during electoral campaigns, in order to appeal to the citizenry of [[Constantinople]]. 

The first modern political factions, however, can be said to have originated in [[early modern Britain]]. The first political factions, cohering around a basic, if fluid, set of principles, emerged from the [[Exclusion Crisis]] and [[Glorious Revolution]] in late 17th century England.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Jones, ''The First Whigs. The Politics of the Exclusion Crisis. 1678–1683'' (Oxford University Press, 1961), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] supported [[Protestant]] [[constitutional monarchy]] against [[Absolute Monarchy|absolute rule]]; the [[Tory (British political party)|Tories]], originating in the [[Royalist]] (or "[[Cavalier]]") faction of the [[English Civil War]], were conservative royalist supporters of a strong monarchy as a counterbalance to the [[Republicanism|republican]] tendencies of Whigs, who were the [[Whig supremacy|dominant political faction]] for most of the first half of the 18th century; the Whigs supported the [[Hanoverian succession]] of 1715 against the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] supporters of the deposed [[Roman Catholic]] [[Stuart dynasty]], and were able to purge Tory politicians from important government positions after the failed [[Jacobite rising of 1715]]. The leader of the Whigs was [[Robert Walpole]], who maintained control of the government in the period 1721–1742; his protégé was [[Henry Pelham]] (1743–1754).

As the century wore on, the factions slowly began to adopt more coherent political tendencies as the interests of their power bases began to diverge. The Whig party's initial base of support from the [[Aristocracy|great aristocratic families]] widened to include the emerging industrial interests and wealthy merchants. As well as championing [[constitutional monarchy]] with strict limits on the monarch's power, the Whigs adamantly opposed a Catholic king as a threat to liberty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hamowy|first=Ronald|authorlink=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |title=Whiggism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC |year=2008 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location=Thousand Oaks, California |isbn=978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024 |lccn=2008009151 |pages=542–43 |doi= 10.4135/9781412965811.n328}}&lt;/ref&gt; and believed in extending [[religious toleration|toleration]] to [[nonconformist]] Protestants, or [[English Dissenters|dissenters]]. A major influence on the Whigs were the liberal political ideas of [[John Locke]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Ashcraft]] and M. M. Goldsmith, "Locke, Revolution Principles, and the Formation of Whig Ideology", ''Historical Journal'', Dec 1983, Vol. 26 Issue 4, pp. 773–800&lt;/ref&gt; and the concepts of universal rights employed by Locke and [[Algernon Sidney]].&lt;ref&gt;Melinda S. Zook, "The Restoration Remembered: The First Whigs  and the Making of their History", ''Seventeenth Century'', Autumn 2002, Vol. 17 Issue 2, pp. 213–34&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Tories were out of office for half a century, for most of this period (at first under the leadership of Sir [[Sir William Wyndham, 3rd Baronet|William Wyndham]]) the Tories retained party cohesion, with occasional hopes of regaining office, particularly at the accession of George II (1727) and the downfall of the ministry of Sir [[Robert Walpole]] in 1742. They acted as a united, though unavailing, opposition to Whig corruption and scandals. At times they cooperated with the "Opposition Whigs", Whigs who were in opposition to the Whig government; however, the ideological gap between the Tories and the Opposition Whigs prevented them from coalescing as a single party. They finally regained power with the accession of [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] in 1760 under [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]].

===Emergence===
When they lost power, the old Whig leadership dissolved into a decade of factional chaos with distinct "[[Grenvillite]]", "[[Bedfordite]]", "[[Rockingham Whigs|Rockinghamite]]", and "[[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Chathamite]]" factions successively in power, and all referring to themselves as "Whigs". Out of this chaos, the first distinctive parties emerged. The first such party was the [[Rockingham Whigs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UH0HNqRBsmMC |title=The Transatlantic Persuasion: The Liberal-Democratic Mind in the Age of Gladstone|author=Robert Lloyd Kelley|year=1990|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Charles Watson-Wentworth]] and the intellectual guidance of the [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] [[Edmund Burke]]. Burke laid out a philosophy that described the basic framework of the political party as "a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavours the national interest, upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed". As opposed to the instability of the earlier factions, which were often tied to a particular leader and could disintegrate if removed from power, the party was centred around a set of core principles and remained out of power as a [[Loyal Opposition|united opposition]] to government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jessenorman.com/2013/09/conhome-op-ed-the-usa-radical-conservatism-and-edmund-burke.html |title=ConHome op-ed: the USA, Radical Conservatism and Edmund Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A-Block-for-the-Wigs-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.2|In ''A Block for the Wigs'' (1783), [[James Gillray]] caricatured Fox's return to power in a coalition with North. George III is the blockhead in the centre.]]

A coalition including the Rockingham Whigs, led by the [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Earl of Shelburne]], took power in 1782, only to collapse after Rockingham's death. The new government, led by the [[radicalism (politics)|radical politician]] [[Charles James Fox]] in coalition with [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]], was soon brought down and replaced by [[William Pitt the Younger]] in 1783. It was now that a genuine two-party system began to emerge, with Pitt leading the new Tories against a reconstituted "Whig" party led by Fox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/sp/0809/minho/gangster1.html|title=The History of Political Parties in England (1678–1914)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary History, xxiv, 213, 222, cited in Foord, ''His Majesty's Opposition'', 1714–1830, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of this split the Whig party was increasingly influenced by the ideas of [[Adam Smith]], founder of [[classical liberalism]]. As Wilson and Reill (2004) note, "Adam Smith's theory melded nicely with the liberal political stance of the Whig Party and its middle-class constituents."&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Wilson and Peter Reill, ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (2004), p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] was created out of the [[British Tory Party#Pittites|'Pittite' Tories]] of the early 19th century. In the late 1820s disputes over political reform broke up this grouping. A government led by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] collapsed amidst dire election results. Following this disaster [[Robert Peel]] set about assembling a new coalition of forces. Peel issued the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] in 1834 which set out the basic principles of Conservatism – the necessity in specific cases of reform in order to survive, but an opposition to unnecessary change, that could lead to "a perpetual vortex of agitation". Meanwhile, the Whigs, along with [[free trade]] Tory followers of [[Robert Peel]], and independent [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]], formed the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] under [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] in 1859, and transformed into a party of the growing urban middle-class, under the long leadership of [[William Ewart Gladstone]].

====In United States====
{{Main|Political parties in the United States}}

Although the framers of the 1787 [[United States Constitution]] did not anticipate that American political discourse would become partisan, political controversies in the early 1790s over the extent of federal government powers saw the [[Presidency of George Washington#Rise of political parties|emergence of two proto-political parties]]: the [[Federalist Party]] and the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which were championed by [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hofstadter, ''The Idea of a Party System: The Rise of Legitimate Opposition in the United States, 1780–1840'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Nisbet Chambers, ed. ''The First Party System'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; However, a consensus reached on these issues ended party politics in 1816 for nearly a decade, a period commonly known as the [[Era of Good Feelings]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Minicucci, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=275165&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S0898588X04000094 Internal Improvements and the Union, 1790–1860], Studies in American Political Development (2004), 18: pp. 160–85, (2004), Cambridge University Press, {{doi|10.1017/S0898588X04000094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The splintering of the Democratic-Republican Party in the aftermath of the contentious [[United States presidential election, 1824|1824 presidential election]] led to the re-emergence of political parties. Two major parties would dominate the political landscape for the next quarter-century: the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]], led by [[Andrew Jackson]], and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], established by [[Henry Clay]] from the [[National Republican Party (United States)|National Republicans]] and from other Anti-Jackson groups. When the Whig Party fell apart in the mid-1850s, its position as a major U.S. political party was filled by the [[History of United States Republican Party|Republican Party]].

[[File:Parnell sitting.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Stewart Parnell]], leader of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]]]
The second half of the 19th century saw the adoption of the party model of politics across Europe. In Germany, France, [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and elsewhere, the [[1848 Revolution]]s sparked a wave of liberal sentiment and the formation of representative bodies and political parties. The end of the century saw the formation of large [[Socialism|socialist parties]] in Europe, some conforming to the teaching of [[Karl Marx]], others adapting [[social democracy]] through the use of reformist and gradualist methods.&lt;ref name="Busky8"&gt;{{Citation |first=Donald F. |last=Busky |title=Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey |place=Westport, Connecticut, USA |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group, Inc., |year=2000 |page=8 |quote=The Frankfurt Declaration of the Socialist International, which almost all social democratic parties are members of, declares the goal of the development of democratic socialism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the political party reached its modern form, with a membership disciplined through the use of a [[party whip]] and the implementation of efficient structures of control. The [[Home Rule League|Home Rule League Party]], campaigning for [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Home Rule]] for Ireland in the [[British Parliament]] was fundamentally changed by the great Irish political leader [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] in the 1880s. In 1882, he changed his party's name to the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] and created a well-organized grass roots structure, introducing membership to replace "ad hoc" informal groupings. He created a new selection procedure to ensure the professional selection of party candidates committed to taking their seats, and in 1884 he imposed a firm 'party pledge' which obliged MPs to vote as a bloc in parliament on all occasions. The creation of a strict party [[whip (politics)|whip]] and a formal party structure was unique at the time. His party's efficient structure and control contrasted with the loose rules and flexible informality found in the [[British political parties|main British parties]]; they soon came to model themselves on the Parnellite model.

==Structure==
A political party is typically led by a [[party leader]] (the most powerful member and spokesperson representing the party), a [[party secretary]] (who maintains the daily work and records of party meetings), [[Treasurer|party treasurer]] (who is responsible for membership dues) and [[party chair]] (who forms strategies for recruiting and retaining party members, and also chairs party meetings). Most of the above positions are also members of the party executive, the leading organization which sets policy for the entire party at the national level. The structure is far more decentralized in the United States because of the separation of powers, federalism and the multiplicity of economic interests and religious sects. Even state parties are decentralized as county and other local committees are largely independent of state central committees. The national party leader in the U.S. will be the president, if the party holds that office, or a prominent member of Congress in opposition (although a big-state governor may aspire to that role). Officially, each party has a chairman for its national committee who is a prominent spokesman, organizer and fund-raiser, but without the status of prominent elected office holders.

In parliamentary democracies, on a regular, periodic basis, [[party conference]]s are held to elect party officers, although snap leadership elections can be called if enough members opt for such. Party conferences are also held in order to affirm party values for members in the coming year. American parties also meet regularly and, again, are more subordinate to elected political leaders.

Depending on the demographic spread of the party membership, party members form local or regional party committees in order to help candidates run for local or regional offices in government. These local party branches reflect the officer positions at the national level.

It is also customary for political party members to form wings for current or prospective party members, most of which fall into the following two categories:
* identity-based: including [[youth wing]]s, [[women's wing]]s, ethnic minority wings, LGBT wings, etc.
* position-based: including wings for candidates, mayors, governors, professionals, students, etc. The formation of these wings may have become routine but their existence is more of an indication of differences of opinion, intra-party rivalry, the influence of interest groups, or attempts to wield influence for one's state or region.

These are useful for party outreach, training and employment. Many young aspiring politicians seek these roles and jobs as stepping stones to their political careers in legislative or executive offices.

The internal structure of political parties has to be democratic in some countries. In Germany Art. 21 Abs. 1 Satz 3 GG establishes a command of inner-party democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Brettschneider, Nutzen der ökonomischen Theorie der Politik für eine Konkretisierung des Gebotes innerparteilicher Demokratie&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentary parties===
When the party is represented by members in the lower house of parliament, the party leader simultaneously serves as the leader of the [[parliamentary group]] of that full party representation; depending on a minimum number of seats held, [[Westminster system|Westminster-based]] parties typically allow for leaders to form [[frontbench]] teams of senior fellow members of the parliamentary group to serve as critics of aspects of government policy. When a party becomes the largest party not part of the Government, the party's parliamentary group forms the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Official Opposition]], with Official Opposition frontbench team members often forming the Official Opposition [[Shadow cabinet]]. When a party achieves enough seats in an election to form a majority, the party's frontbench becomes the Cabinet of government ministers. They are all elected members.There are members who attend party without promotion

==Regulation==
The freedom to form, declare membership in, or campaign for candidates from a political party is considered a measurement of a state's adherence to liberal democracy as a political value. Regulation of parties may run from a crackdown on or repression of all opposition parties, a norm for authoritarian governments, to the repression of certain parties which hold or promote ideals which run counter to the general ideology of the state's incumbents (or possess membership by-laws which are legally unenforceable).

Furthermore, in the case of far-right, far-left and regionalism parties in the national parliaments of much of the European Union, mainstream political parties may form an informal [[cordon sanitaire]] which applies a policy of non-cooperation towards those "[http://ppq.sagepub.com/content/17/4/443.abstract Outsider Parties]" present in the legislature which are viewed as 'anti-system' or otherwise unacceptable for government. ''Cordons sanitaire'', however, have been increasingly abandoned over the past two decades in multi-party democracies as the pressure to construct broad coalitions in order to win elections – along with the increased willingness of outsider parties themselves to participate in government – has led to many such parties entering electoral and government coalitions.&lt;ref&gt;McDonnell, Duncan and Newell, James (2011) '[http://ppq.sagepub.com/content/17/4/443.abstract Outsider Parties]'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the second half of the 20th century, modern democracies have introduced rules for the flow of funds through party coffers, e.g. the Canada Election Act 1976, the PPRA in the U.K. or the FECA in the U.S. Such [[political finance]] regimes stipulate a variety of regulations for the transparency of fundraising and expenditure, limit or ban specific kinds of activity and provide public subsidies for party activity, including campaigning.

==Partisan style==
Partisan style varies according to each jurisdiction, depending on how many parties there are, and how much influence each individual party has.

===Nonpartisan systems===
In a [[nonpartisan system]], no official political parties exist, sometimes reflecting legal [[restrictions on political parties]]. In nonpartisan elections, each candidate is eligible for office on his or her own merits. In nonpartisan legislatures, there are no typically formal party alignments within the legislature. The administration of [[George Washington]] and the first few sessions of the [[United States Congress]] were nonpartisan. Washington also warned against political parties during his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].&lt;ref&gt;Redding 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[unicameral]] [[Nebraska Legislature|legislature]] of [[Nebraska]] is nonpartisan but is elected and often votes on informal party lines. In Canada, the territorial legislatures of the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] are nonpartisan. In New Zealand, [[Tokelau]] has a nonpartisan parliament.  Many city and county governments in the United States and Canada are nonpartisan. Nonpartisan elections and modes of governance are common outside of state institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Abizadeh 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Unless there are legal prohibitions against political parties, factions within nonpartisan systems often evolve into political parties.

===Uni-party systems===
In [[one-party state|one-party systems]], one political party is legally allowed to hold effective power. Although minor parties may sometimes be allowed, they are legally required to accept the leadership of the dominant party. This party may not always be identical to the government, although sometimes positions within the party may in fact be more important than positions within the government. [[North Korea]] and China are examples; others can be found in Fascist states, such as [[Nazi Germany]] between 1934 and 1945. The one-party system is thus often equated with dictatorships and tyranny.

In [[dominant-party system]]s, opposition parties are allowed, and there may be even a deeply established democratic tradition, but other parties are widely considered to have no real chance of gaining power. Sometimes, political, social and economic circumstances, and public opinion are the reason for others parties' failure. Sometimes, typically in countries with less of an established democratic tradition, it is possible the dominant party will remain in power by using [[patronage]] and sometimes by [[voting fraud]]. In the latter case, the definition between dominant and one-party system becomes rather blurred. Examples of dominant party systems include the [[People's Action Party]] in Singapore, the [[African National Congress]] in South Africa, the [[Cambodian People's Party]] in Cambodia, the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] in Japan, and the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] in Algeria. One-party dominant system also existed in [[Mexico]] with the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] until the 1990s, in the southern United States with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] from the late 19th century until the 1970s, in [[Indonesia]] with the ''[[Golkar]]'' from the early 1970s until 1998.

===Bi-party systems===
[[Two-party system]]s are states such as [[Honduras]], [[Jamaica]], [[Malta]], [[Ghana]] and the United States in which there are two political parties dominant to such an extent that electoral success under the banner of any other party is almost impossible. One right wing coalition party and one left wing coalition party is the most common ideological breakdown in such a system but in two-party states political parties are traditionally [[Big tent|catch all parties]] which are ideologically broad and inclusive.

The United States has become essentially a two-party system, since a conservative (such as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]) and liberal (such as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]) party has usually been the status quo within American politics. The first parties were called Federalist and Republican, followed by a brief period of Republican dominance before a split occurred between National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. The former became the Whig Party and the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections. Despite this, there have been several examples of third parties siphoning votes from major parties that were expected to win (such as [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1912|election of 1912]] and [[George Wallace]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1968|election of 1968]]). As third party movements have learned, the Electoral College's requirement of a nationally distributed majority makes it difficult for third parties to succeed. Thus, such parties rarely win many electoral votes, although their popular support within a state may tip it toward one party or the other. Wallace had weak support outside the South. More generally, parties with a broad base of support across regions or among economic and other interest groups, have a great chance of winning the necessary plurality in the U.S.'s largely single-member district, winner-take-all elections. The tremendous land area and large population of the country are formidable challenges to political parties with a narrow appeal.

The UK political system, while technically a [[multi-party system]], has functioned generally as a two-party (sometimes called a "two-and-a-half party") system; since the 1920s the two largest political parties have been the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Before the Labour Party rose in British politics the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] was the other major political party along with the Conservatives. Though [[Coalition government|coalition]] and [[minority government]]s have been an occasional feature of parliamentary politics, the [[plurality electoral system|first-past-the-post]] electoral system used for [[Elections in the United Kingdom|general elections]] tends to maintain the dominance of these two parties, though each has in the past century relied upon a third party to deliver a working majority in Parliament.&lt;ref name="BBC2005"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/past_elections/html/default.stm |title=General Election results through time, 1945–2001 |work=BBC News |accessdate=19 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A plurality voting system usually leads to a two-party system, a relationship described by [[Maurice Duverger]] and known as [[Duverger's Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Duverger 1954&lt;/ref&gt;) There are also numerous other parties that hold or have held a number of seats in Parliament.

===Multi-party systems===
[[File:ElezioneBrunate.jpg|thumb|right|A poster for the [[European Parliament]] election 2004 in Italy, showing party lists]]
[[Multi-party]] systems are systems in which more than two parties are represented and elected to public office.

Australia, Canada, [[Nepal]], Pakistan, India, Ireland, United Kingdom and Norway are examples of countries with two strong parties and additional smaller parties that have also obtained representation. The smaller or "third" parties may hold the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in a parliamentary system, and thus may be invited to form a part of a [[coalition government]] together with one of the larger parties, or may provide a [[supply and confidence]] agreement to the government; or may instead act independently from the dominant parties.

More commonly, in cases where there are three or more parties, no one party is likely to gain power alone, and parties have to work with each other to form coalition governments. This is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the [[Communes of Germany|communal]] level. Furthermore, since the forming of the [[Republic of Iceland]] there has never been a government not led by a coalition, usually involving the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] or the [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]]. A similar situation exists in the [[Republic of Ireland]], where no one party has held power on its own since 1989. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed. These coalitions have been led exclusively by either [[Fianna Fáil]] or [[Fine Gael]].

Political change is often easier with a coalition government than in one-party or two-party dominant systems.{{Dubious|date=June 2010}} If factions in a two-party system are in fundamental disagreement on policy goals, or even principles, they can be slow to make policy changes, which appears to be the case now in the U.S. with power split between Democrats and Republicans. Still coalition governments struggle, sometimes for years, to change policy and often fail altogether, post World War II France and Italy being prime examples. When one party in a two-party system controls all elective branches, however, policy changes can be both swift and significant. Democrats Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson were beneficiaries of such fortuitous circumstances, as were Republicans as far removed in time as Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. Barack Obama briefly had such an advantage between 2009 and 2011. As of 2017, President Donald Trump currently enjoys Republican control of both the house and senate.

==Funding==
{{Main|Political party funding|Political finance}}

Political parties are funded by contributions from
* party members and other individuals,
* organizations, which share their political ideas (e.g. [[Affiliated trade union|trade union affiliation fees]]) or which could benefit from their activities (e.g. [[corporate donations]]) or
* governmental or [[Party subsidies|public funding]].&lt;ref&gt;See Heard, Alexander, 'Political financing'. In: Sills, David I. (ed.) ''International Emcyclopedia of the Social Sciences'', vol. 12. New York: Free Press – Macmillan, 1968, pp.&amp;nbsp;235–41; Paltiel, Khayyam Z., 'Campaign finance – contrasting practices and reforms'. In: Butler, David et al. (eds.), Democracy at the polls – a comparative study of competitive national elections. Washington, D.C.: AEI, 1981, pp. 138–72; Paltiel, Khayyam Z., 'Political finance'. In: Bogdanor, Vernon (ed.), ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Institutions''. Oxford, UK: Blackwell, 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;454–56; 'Party finance', in: Kurian, George T. et al. (eds.) The encyclopedia of political science. vol 4, Washington, D.C.: CQ Press, 2011, pp. 1187–89.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Political parties, still called [[Political faction|factions]] by some, especially those in the governmental apparatus, are [[lobbying|lobbied]] vigorously by organizations, businesses and [[special interest groups]] such as [[trades unions|trade unions]]. Money and gifts-in-kind to a party, or its leading members, may be offered as incentives. Such donations are the traditional source of funding for all right-of-centre cadre parties. Starting in the late 19th century these parties were opposed by the newly founded left-of-centre workers' parties. They started a new party type, the mass membership party, and a new source of political fundraising, membership dues.

From the second half of the 20th century on parties which continued to rely on donations or membership subscriptions ran into mounting problems. Along with the increased scrutiny of donations there has been a long-term decline in party memberships in most western democracies which itself places more strains on funding. For example, in the United Kingdom and Australia membership of the two main parties in 2006 is less than an 1/8 of what it was in 1950, despite significant increases in population over that period.

In some parties, such as the post-communist parties of France and Italy or the [[Sinn Féin]] party and the [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party]], elected representatives (i.e. incumbents) take only the average industrial wage from their salary as a representative, while the rest goes into party coffers. Although these examples may be rare nowadays, "[[rent-seeking]]" continues to be a feature of many political parties around the world.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Foresti and Wild 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5143&amp;title=political-parties-governance-politics Support to political parties: a missing piece of the governance puzzle]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, it has been alleged that [[peerages]] have been awarded to contributors to party funds, the benefactors becoming members of the [[House of Lords]] and thus being in a position to participate in legislating. Famously, [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] was found to have been selling peerages. To prevent such corruption in the future, Parliament passed the [[Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925]] into law. Thus the outright sale of peerages and similar honours became a [[criminal act]]. However, some benefactors are alleged to have attempted to circumvent this by cloaking their contributions as loans, giving rise to the '[[Cash for Peerages]]' scandal.

Such activities as well as assumed "[[influence peddling]]" have given rise to demands that the scale of donations should be capped. As the costs of electioneering escalate, so the demands made on party funds increase. In the UK some politicians are advocating that parties should be funded by the [[State (polity)|state]]; a proposition that promises to give rise to interesting debate in a country that was the first to regulate campaign expenses (in 1883).

In many other democracies such subsidies for party activity (in general or just for campaign purposes) have been introduced decades ago. Public financing for parties and/ or candidates (during election times and beyond) has several permutations and is increasingly common. Germany, Sweden, Israel, Canada, Australia, Austria and Spain are cases in point. More recently among others France, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands and Poland have followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;For details you may want to consult specific articles on [[Campaign finance in the United States]], [[Federal political financing in Canada]], [[Party finance in Germany]], [[Political donations in Australia]], [[Political finance]], [[Political funding in Japan]], [[Political funding in the United Kingdom]].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two broad categories of public funding, direct, which entails a monetary transfer to a party, and indirect, which includes broadcasting time on [[state media]], use of the mail service or supplies.  According to the Comparative Data from the [[ACE Electoral Knowledge Network]], out of a sample of over 180 nations, 25% of nations provide no direct or indirect public funding, 58% provide direct public funding and 60% of nations provide indirect public funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceproject.org/epic-en/CDMap?question=PC12 ACEproject.org] ACE Electoral Knowledge Network: Comparative Data: Political Parties and Candidates&lt;/ref&gt;  Some countries provide both direct and indirect public funding to political parties.  Funding may be equal for all parties or depend on the results of previous elections or the number of candidates participating in an election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceproject.org/epic-en/CDMap?question=PC15 ACEproject.org] ACE Electoral Knowledge Network: Comparative Data: Political Parties and Candidates&lt;/ref&gt;  Frequently parties rely on a mix of private and public funding and are required to disclose their finances to the [[Election management body]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceproject.org/ace-en/focus/core/crb/crb05/?searchterm=party%20funding ACEproject.org] ACE Encyclopaedia: Public funding of political parties&lt;/ref&gt;

In fledgling democracies funding can also be provided by [[foreign aid]]. International donors provide financing to political parties in developing countries as a means to promote democracy and [[good governance]]. Support can be purely financial or otherwise. Frequently it is provided as capacity development activities including the development of party manifestos, party constitutions and campaigning skills.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Developing links between ideologically linked parties is another common feature of international support for a party.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Sometimes this can be perceived as directly supporting the political aims of a political party, such as the support of the US government to the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] party behind the [[Rose Revolution]]. Other donors work on a more neutral basis, where multiple donors provide grants in countries accessible by all parties for various aims defined by the recipients.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; There have been calls by leading development think-tanks, such as the Overseas Development Institute, to increase support to political parties as part of developing the capacity to deal with the demands of interest-driven donors to improve governance.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

==Colors and emblems==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from Color --&gt;
{{main|Political colour|List of political party symbols}}

Generally speaking, over the world, political parties associate themselves with colors, primarily for identification, especially for voter recognition during [[elections]]. 

• Blue generally denotes conservatism.&lt;ref name="bbc color"&gt;{{citation | publisher=BBC | title=Why is the Conservative Party Blue | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4923050.stm | date=20 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

• Yellow is often used for [[liberalism]] or [[libertarianism]].  

• Red often signifies [[Social democracy|social democratic]], socialist or [[Comunism|communist]] parties.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} 

• Green is often associated with [[green politics]], [[Islamism]], [[agrarianism]] and [[Irish republicanism]].

• Orange is the traditional color of [[Christian democracy]]. 

• Black is generally associated with fascist parties, going back to [[Benito Mussolini]]'s blackshirts, but also with [[Anarchism]]. Similarly, brown is sometimes associated with [[Nazism]], going back to the [[Nazi Party]]'s [[brownshirt|tan-uniformed]] [[storm trooper]]s.

Color associations are useful for mnemonics when voter illiteracy is significant.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Another case where they are used is when it is not desirable to make rigorous links to parties, particularly when [[coalition]]s and alliances are formed between political parties and other organizations, for example: "[[Purple (government)|Purple]]" (Red-Blue) alliances, [[Red-green alliance]]s, [[Blue-green alliance]]s, [[Traffic light coalition]]s, [[Pan-green coalition]]s, and [[Pan-blue coalition]]s.

Political color schemes in the United States diverge from international norms. Since 2000, red has become associated with the right-wing [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and blue with the left-wing [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. However, unlike political color schemes of other countries, the parties did not choose those colors; they were used in news coverage of 2000 election results and ensuing legal battle and caught on in popular usage. Prior to the 2000 election the media typically alternated which color represented which party each presidential election cycle. The color scheme happened to get inordinate attention that year, so the cycle was stopped lest it cause confusion the following election.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |work=Washington Post | title= Elephants Are Red, Donkeys Are Blue | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17079-2004Nov1.html |first=Paul |last=Farhi |date=2 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emblems ===

The emblem of socialist parties is often a red [[rose]] held in a fist. Communist parties often use a [[hammer]] to represent the worker, a [[sickle]] to represent the farmer, or [[Hammer and sickle|both a hammer and a sickle]] to refer to both at the same time.

The emblem of [[Nazism]], the [[swastika]] or ''"[[hakenkreuz]]"'', has been adopted as a near-universal symbol for almost any organised white supremacist group, even though it dates from more ancient times.

=== Symbols ===

[[Symbols]] can be very important when the overall [[Constituency|electorate]] is illiterate. In the [[Kenyan constitutional referendum, 2005]], supporters of the constitution used the banana as their symbol, while the "no" used an orange.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==International organization==
During the 19th and 20th century, many national political parties organized themselves into international organizations along similar policy lines. Notable examples are [[The Universal Party]], [[International Workingmen's Association]] (also called the First International), the [[Socialist International]] (also called the Second International), the [[Communist International]] (also called the Third International), and the [[Fourth International]], as organizations of [[working class party|working class parties]], or the [[Liberal International]] (yellow), [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]], [[Christian Democratic International]] and the [[International Democrat Union]] (blue). Organized in Italy in 1945, the [[International Communist Party]], since 1974 headquartered in Florence has sections in six countries.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Worldwide green parties]] have recently established the [[Global Greens]]. [[The Universal Party]], The Socialist International, the Liberal International, and the [[International Democrat Union]] are all based in London.
Some administrations (e.g. Hong Kong) outlaw formal linkages between local and foreign political organizations, effectively outlawing international political parties.

==Types==
French political scientist [[Maurice Duverger]] drew a distinction between "cadre" parties and "mass" parties. Cadre parties were political elites that were concerned with contesting elections and restricted the influence of outsiders, who were only required to assist in election campaigns. Mass parties tried to recruit new members who were a source of party income and were often expected to spread party ideology as well as assist in elections. Socialist parties are examples of mass parties, while the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the UK and the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|German Christian Democratic Union]] in [[Germany]] are examples of hybrid parties. In the United States, where both major parties were cadre parties, the introduction of primaries and other reforms has transformed them so that power is held by activists who compete over influence and nomination of candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, ''Political parties'', pp. 65–67&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Klaus von Beyme]] categorised European parties into nine families, which described most parties. He was able to arrange seven of them from left to right:  Communist, Socialist, [[Green party|Green]], Liberal, [[Christian democratic]], Conservative and [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]]. The position of two other types, [[Agrarianism|Agrarian]] and Regional/Ethnic parties varied.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, ''Political parties'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5674">The '''Public Whip''' is a [[parliamentary informatics]] project that analyses and publishes the voting history of MPs in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].

It was developed by [[Francis Irving]] and [[Julian Todd]] following the [[18 March 2003 Parliamentary Approval for the invasion of Iraq]] as a tool to record which MPs had defied their party's [[Chief Whip|whip]] long after the information had become effectively inaccessible for reference.

On 1 August 2011 Irving and Todd handed control of the site to a new team.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.publicwhip.org.uk/2011/08/okay-so-what-are-you-going-to-do-with-it/&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is loosely affiliated to [[mySociety]]'s [[TheyWorkForYou]] with which it shares a large part of the same parliamentary parsing code-base.

In 2014 the [[OpenAustralia Foundation]] launched a fork of the project for Australia’s federal parliament called [https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/ They Vote For You] .

==Awards and funding==
In 2004 the Public Whip won the ''[[New Statesman]]'' New Media Award for "civic renewal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/nma/nma2004/nma2004winners.htm|title=New Media Awards TwoThousandAndFour|publisher=[[New Statesman]]|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has never received a grant from any funding body and remains entirely paid for by its creators, including server costs and bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/faq.php#money|title=FAQ: Do you make any money out of Public Whip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
Originally the software was written in [[Perl]], and then later rewritten in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].  The main process downloads the daily transcripts from the online [[Hansard]], matches and assigns IDs to the names of MPs, and saves them into XML files.  These are later uploaded into a [[mySQL]] table and viewed through [[PHP]] webpages.

At the end of 2003 the project was extended to read the archive of [[Parliamentary Written Answers]]. Following a request from [[mySociety]], the Parliamentary Parser&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ukparse.kforge.net/parlparse/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716082215/http://ukparse.kforge.net/parlparse/ |archivedate=2006-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was expanded to include House of Commons and Westminster Hall debates, and finally the House of Lords, which are all more or less in the same format. It is now maintained by them to provide the data to their [[TheyWorkForYou]] website.

==Publicity==
The website has occasionally been cited in newspaper articles, and is sometimes referred to in election material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flourish.org/blog/index.php?p=119|date=3 March 2005|title=Found this week in Bristol election leaflet|author=Francis Irving}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been used to provide voting analysis to citizens during elections.

==Activism==
An election quiz which advised voters of which party or incumbent candidate most closely matched their political opinions (according to the Parliamentary vote) was on the site for the 2005 General election and received over 10,000 hits.

In anticipation of preparing a version of it again for the next general election, Julian has distributed leaflets and tried out variations of the site at the [[Crewe and Nantwich by-election, 2008]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freesteel.co.uk/wpblog/2008/05/the-publicwhip-crewe-two/|title=The Public Whip Crewe|date=19 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/05/17/public_whip_site/|title=Can't decide how to vote?

==Creators==
[[Francis Irving]] currently does programming work for [[mySociety]], most recently ''[[WhatDoTheyKnow]]'', a site that provides an on-line interface to the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]].

[[Julian Todd]] has extended the concept of parsing transcripts for speeches and votes to the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] and [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] of the [[United Nations]] with a website called undemocracy.com established in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/mar/13/internet.politics|title=Is it possible for geeks to fix the United Nations?|date=13 March 2008|publisher=The Guardian|first=Wendy|last=Grossman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work was motivated by the discovery of the transcripts on-line during research into the application of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267]] in his home town of Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freesteel.co.uk/wpblog/2006/09/the-un-as-evidenced-on-the-streets-of-liverpool/|date=4 September 2006|title=The UN as evidenced on the streets of Liverpool|publisher=Freesteel blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[West Berlin]] band [[Ton Steine Scherben]]'s '''Rauch-Haus-Song''' describes the occupation by squatters of the former Bethanien-Krankenhaus (Bethanien hospital), from the viewpoint of the squatters. The title reflects the fact that the squatters renamed the building "The Georg-von-Rauch-Haus" after [[Georg von Rauch]], a leftist extremist who died in a shootout with police in 1971. Within the German squatter movement, the song became a classic, with the [[refrain]] "Das ist unser Haus" (This is our house) being shouted out as a motto.  The song appears on the album [[Keine Macht für Niemand]].

[[WestBam]] published  a Remix on ''Pop 2001 - Geschichte wird gemacht'' in 2001.

A '''resident magistrate''' is a title for [[magistrate]]s used in certain parts of the world, that were, or are, governed by the British. Sometimes abbreviated as '''RM''', it refers to suitably qualified personnel—notably well versed in the law—brought into an area from outside as the local magistrate, typically to be the guiding hand amongst other lay magistrates.

In colonial history, resident magistrates have had [[gubernatorial]] functions in a few minor, isolated colonial settlements, such as:
*[[Ascension Island|Ascension]], as dependency of [[Saint Helena]]; post filled by managers of Eastern Telegraph/Cable and Wireless since 1922 (previously under a [[commanding officer]]), replaced since June 1964 by an Administrator
*[[Walvisbaai]], only two incumbents shortly after the 12 March 1878 annexed by Britain as Walvis Bay [[protectorate]], first under a Captain; annexation confirmed 14 December 1878:
**1 June 1878 – November 1880 D. Erskine
**November 1880 – 7 August 1884 Benjamin Musgrave, staying on as Magistrate

Resident magistrates' courts remain in operation as one of the divisions of the [[judiciary of Jamaica]], hearing civil and criminal cases in each parish of the island.

==In Ireland==

In pre-independence Ireland, a Resident Magistrate was a stipendary magistrate appointed to a county (outside of the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]] District) to sit among the [[justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] at [[Petty Sessions]] in that county. They were appointed by the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] (in reality, therefore, by the [[Dublin Castle administration in Ireland]]).

===Role===
The role of resident magistrate was created on a somewhat trial basis in 1814, and extended to the entire country by the Constabulary (Ireland) Act 1836. The resident magistrate was supposed to sit amongst the justices at Petty Sessions—the courts of summary jurisdiction in pre-independence Ireland—and guide the justices to apply the law imparitally. In reality they came to preside at Petty Sessions, and even sit alone without justices. RMs did not need to be legally trained in pre-independence Ireland, and many were ex-[[British Army]] officers. The "Resident" referred to the requirement that the magistrate live in the county to which he was assigned.

The role was often criticised as being under the influence of the Dublin Castle administration, and Irish politicians often cited the "RM" as really standing for "Removable Magistrate", since they held office at the Lord Lieutenant's pleasure and could be removed.

===After Irish independence===

The office of RM was unique in the United Kingdom to Ireland, and in the 20th century, led to the modern position in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland whereby courts of summary jurisdiction (the [[District Court (Ireland)|District Court]] in the Republic and [[Courts of Northern Ireland#Subordinate courts|Magistrates' Courts]] in Northern Ireland), are composed of legally qualified district judges sitting alone. This is in sharp contrast to [[England and Wales]] where magistrates courts mainly consist of benches of three lay justices and there are only a minority of paid district judges (magistrates' courts). In Scotland Justice of the Peace Courts are also primarily staffed by lay magistrates.

====Republic of Ireland====
In the part of Ireland that was to become the Irish Free State, Petty Sessions could not be held for many years due to the [[Irish War of Independence]], restricting the role of the RMs. On 23 August 1922, the [[Provisional Government of Ireland (1922)|Provisional Government of Ireland]] placed all of the RMs on leave, and at the end of September 1922 it terminated all commissions of the peace, effectively dismissing all the RMs and justices of the peace. This was not quite the end of the office of Resident Magistrate, as it then proceeded to appoint 27 solicitors and barristers to the post.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/library3.nsf/(WebFiles)/92E26C802274604280257888003CFD32/$FILE/WGJC%20Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Although appointed to the position of Resident Magistrate, the Provisional Government only publicly described these individuals as District Justices, and brought in legislation in 1923 (the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923) to officially change the name of the position.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1923/en/act/pub/0006/sec0002.html#sec2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Courts of Justice Act 1924]] finally abolished the office and transferred its jurisdiction to the [[District Court (Ireland)|District Court of Justice]]. The Justices of the District Court continued to be popularly called District Justices until the position was renamed Judge of the District Court (or District Judge) in 1991.

====Northern Ireland====
The position continued as before in Northern Ireland until 1935, when the Summary Jurisdiction and Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) was passed. From then on Resident Magistrates had to be legally qualified solicitors or barristers in Northern Ireland of at least six years' standing. Petty Sessions (which later became known as Magistrates' Courts) would henceforth consist solely of a resident magistrate sitting alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/special/2000/justice/11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since the passing of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, two lay magistrates sit with the district judge in Youth Court (criminal proceedings involving children) and Family Proceedings Court (family law) matters, but the judge still sits alone in other matters. Where lay magistrates sit with the judge, the judge presides and guides the lay magistrates in the law. The position was renamed District Judge (Magistrates Court) in 2008.

===In popular culture===
{{main|The Irish RM}}
The book ''Some Experiences of an Irish RM'' by [[Edith Somerville]] and [[Violet Florence Martin]], published in 1899 focused on a fictional Irish RM, Major Yeates. Two sequels were written and a TV situation comedy, ''[[The Irish R.M.]]'', produced by [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] and [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]], which ran between 1983 and 1985.

==Deputy magistrate==
When the [[Caprivi Strip]] (formerly German Barotse- or Zambezi-land, in present Namibia) which had been administered by British [[Military Administrator]]s since 21 September 1914 formally came under the administration of the British [[high commissioner]]s for Southern Africa, the last Military Administrator stayed on as the first of only two Deputy magistrates, the highest British colonial official actually resident in the Strip:

* 1 January 1921 – c.1924 H. Neale
* 1940 – 1951 Lyall French Trollope

'''Rose Rosenberg''', '''[[CBE]]''' (1 September 1892 – 13 April 1966) was a [[History of the Jews in England|Jewish English woman]] who served as the private secretary for statesman [[Ramsay MacDonald]] from 1923 to 1935. Prior to her employment with MacDonald, she worked in the [[National Council for Civil Liberties]] with those opposed to conscription and was the personal assistant of [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|suffragette]], [[Margaret Mackworth, 2nd Viscountess Rhondda]]. She was known for her ability to keep secrets, monitoring those who wished to engage with MacDonald, and earned the nickname "Miss Rose of No. 10" from the international press. She was honored as a Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1930. In later life, she worked for the British publicity office of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and in various positions during World War II providing assistance.

==Early life==
Rose Rosenberg was born on 1 September 1892 in [[Spitalfields]], a parish of [[London]], England to Rachel (née Rosenthal) and Isaac Rosenberg.{{sfn|Curthoys|2014}}{{sfn|Zunser|1929|p=7}} Both of her parents were born in Russia and were naturalized citizens of Britain.{{sfn|Curthoys|2014}} At a young age, she began studying piano and wanted to become a professional musician.{{sfn|Zunser|1929|p=7}} Completing her elementary schooling, she enrolled at a commercial college and took university extension classes, learning [[shorthand]] and typing.{{sfn|Curthoys|2014}} Family circumstances forced her to leave her studies at the age of fourteen.{{sfn|Zunser|1929|p=7}} Rosenberg joined the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] while still a teenager, working for [[women's suffrage]] and during [[World War I]] became a pacifist, assisting [[conscientious objector]]s with her knowledge of the various military acts.{{sfn|Ody|1929|p=23}}{{sfn|''The Pittsburgh Press''|1930|p=37}} She had been hired as an assistant to the director of the [[National Council for Civil Liberties]] and when he left for health reasons, she took over the post.{{sfn|Curthoys|2014}} Simultaneously, at age seventeen, she became editor of a mining magazine and joined the [[Fabian Society]]. The following year, she became the private secretary of [[Margaret Mackworth, 2nd Viscountess Rhondda|Lady Rhondda]].{{sfn|''The Pittsburgh Press''|1930|p=37}}{{sfn|Klotts|1937|p=5}}{{sfn|Curthoys|2014}}

==Career==
In 1919, she joined the general staff of the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]]{{sfn|''The Pittsburgh Press''|1930|p=37}}{{sfn|Klotts|1937|p=5}} and in 1923 was hired by [[Ramsay MacDonald]], the Labour Party leader, as his private secretary.{{sfn|Ody|1929|p=23}}{{sfn|Church|1924|p=85}} When MacDonald became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] (PM) she earned the nickname in the press as "Miss Rose of No. 10", after [[10 Downing Street]], headquarters of the [[Government of the United Kingdom]]. She remained at her post when he resigned the premiership in 1925 and became the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|leader of the opposition]]. From 1929{{sfn|''The Pittsburgh Press''|1930|p=37}} through MacDonald's second posting as PM, which ended in 1935, Rosenberg was the conduit for information between him and both the press and the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].{{sfn|''Illustrated London News''|1966|p=31}} 

Rosenberg maintained the correspondence of MacDonald, keeping the only other key to his confidential papers. She and his daughter [[Ishbel MacDonald]] became friends and together they tried to shield him from the pressures of office. In 1928, she became the first woman admitted to the House of Commons' Strangers' Dining Room and the following year accompanied MacDonald on a visit to the United States, the first time a sitting British PM had come to the US.{{sfn|Curthoys|2014}} She was honored as a Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1930.{{sfn|''The Guardian''|1930|p=12}} She served him until 1937{{sfn|Klotts|1937|p=5}} and left in June to serve as an executive at the British branch of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in charge of their publicity.{{sfn|''The Times''|1937|p=18}}{{sfn|Curthoys|2014}} 

On 2 October 1939, Rosenberg married Laszlo Hoenig, a Hungarian architect and interior designer, in [[Chelsea, London]]{{sfn|''The Times''|1939|p=12}}{{sfn|''The Winnipeg Tribune''|1939|p=14}}{{sfn|''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle''|1939|p=30}} Her husband opened a furniture showroom of his modernist designs in [[Mayfair]].{{sfn|Curthoys|2014}} During [[World War II]], she worked with [[Stella Isaacs, Marchioness of Reading|Lady Reading]] at the [[Women's Voluntary Service]]{{sfn|''The Winnipeg Tribune''|1939|p=14}} for Civil Defence.{{sfn|''The Times''|1966|p=14}} She also worked on the Committee of Friends of the Hebrew University and performed work with refugees.{{sfn|Curthoys|2014}} She and Hoenig divorced in 1954 and she returned as a legal advisor to the National Council for Civil Liberties.{{sfn|''The Times''|1966|p=14}}

==Death and legacy==
Hoenig died on 13 April 1966, in London.{{sfn|Jewish Telegraphic Agency|1966}} She was remembered as the "power behind Ramsay MacDonald's throne" for her ability to maintain discretion and to navigate and manage communications conduits to and from the Prime Minister.{{sfn|''Illustrated London News''|1966|p=31}} Though in later life she would give interviews about office procedures during her tenure with MacDonald, she refused to publish a memoir or divulge information on the personalities or business to which she was privy.{{sfn|Curthoys|2014}}

'''Saeed Mortazavi''' ({{lang-fa|سعید مرتضوی}}, born 1967) is an Iranian [[Iranian Principlists|conservative]] politician, former [[judge]] and former [[prosecutor]]. He was prosecutor of the [[Islamic Revolutionary Court]], and Prosecutor General of [[Tehran]], a position he held from  2003 to 2009.&lt;ref name="ghaemi"/&gt; He has been called as "butcher of the press" and "torturer of Tehran" by some observers.&lt;ref name="tol"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6570089.ece Saeed Murtazavi: butcher of the press - and torturer of Tehran?] Jenny Booth and James Hider, 25 June 2009, The Sunday Times.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mortazavi has been accused of the torture and death in custody of Iranian-[[Canada|Canadian]] photographer [[Zahra Kazemi]] by the Canadian government&lt;ref name="tol"/&gt; and was named by 2010 Iranian parliamentary report as the man responsible for abuse of dozens and death of three political prisoners at [[Kahrizak detention center]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; He was put on trial in February 2013 after a parliamentary committee blamed him for the torture and deaths of at least three detainees who participated in the protests against President [[Mahmud Ahmadinejad]]'s reelection.&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt; On 15 November 2014, he was banned from all political and legal positions for life.

== Career and actions ==
Before his prosecutorial appointment, Mortazavi was a judge.

On 18 May 2003 he became prosecutor general of Tehran, a position he held until 29 August 2009.&lt;ref name="ghaemi"/&gt; The post had been unfilled for the previous eight years, since Iran abolished prosecutors in 1995. In the intervening years judges performed the prosecutor's role.&lt;ref name="topprosecutor"&gt;{{cite news|title=Top Prosecutor|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=1 May 2003|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E4D71F3DF932A35756C0A9659C8B63&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=Saeed+Mortazavi&amp;st=nyt|accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Zahra Kazemi===
[[File:Saeed Mortazavi - July 22, 2003.png|thumb|Mortazavi in a press conference, July 22, 2003]]

Mortazavi is notable for his involvement in the case of [[Zahra Kazemi]], an [[Iran]]ian-[[Canada|Canadian]] photographer who died in the custody of Iranian officials in 2003. As a judge, Mortazevi was involved in some unknown capacity in Kazemi's interrogation. He was later assigned to investigate the disputed circumstances of her death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nazila|first=Fathi|title=Report on Journalist|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=23 July 2003|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E0DA143FF930A15754C0A9659C8B63&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Saeed+Mortazavi&amp;st=nyt|accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was subsequently reported that Mortazevi had decided to let a military court perform the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nazila|first=Fatih|title=Canada Recalls Envoy From Iran After Burial of Detained Reporter|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=24 July 2003| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01EFDD143EF932A05754C0A9659C8B63&amp;scp=15&amp;sq=Saeed+Mortazavi&amp;st=nyt|accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2003, the Iranian Parliament issued a report accusing Mortazavi of trying to cover up Kazemi's death and forcing witnesses to the event to change their stories. Murtazevi strongly denied the accusations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nazile|first=Fathi|title=  Arrests of Dissident Iranians Seen as Hard-Line Retaliation|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=4 November 2008|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE2DC1E30F937A35752C1A9659C8B63&amp;scp=7&amp;sq=Saeed+Mortazavi&amp;st=nyt|accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[government of Canada]] continues to claim that not only did Mortazavi order Kazemi's arrest, but he also supervised her torture and was present when she was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=Richard|title=Canada Calls for Arrest of Iranian Official|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=27 June 2006|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5514415| accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suppression of press===
Mortazavi is often portrayed in the western media as a symbol of problems within the [[judicial system of Iran]]. It has been reported that Iranians call him the "butcher of the press". As a judge he shut down 60 pro-reform newspapers.&lt;ref name="topprosecutor"/&gt;

In 2004 he was behind the detention of more than 20 bloggers and journalists whom were held for long periods of time and forced to sign “confessions” of their “illicit activities”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;”Iran’s Press ‘butcher’ to grill reformists” [[Ottawa Citizen]] 25 June  2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, journalists reported receiving death threats after testifying about their alleged torture at the command of Mortazevi.  In a press conference, Mortazevi denied the journalists had been mistreated while in state custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title= Journalists Receive Death Threats After Testifying|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=6 January 2005|url= http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/01/06/iran9948.htm|accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Like the Dead in their Coffins: Torture, Detention, and the Crushing of Dissent in Iran|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|url= https://www.hrw.org/campaigns/torture/iran/|accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2005, Murtazevi ordered Iran's major [[Internet service provider|ISPs]] to block access to [[Orkut]] and other blogging and social networking websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Murtazavi ordered recent filtering|language=Persian|newspaper=[[BBC Persian]]|date=9 January 2005|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/story/2005/01/050109_a_iran_weblog.shtml|accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 February 2008, it was announced that Mortazavi had [[Censorship in Iran|banned]] five Iranian websites that comment on politics and current events. Mortazevi was quoted as saying they were "poisoning the electoral sphere" in advance of Iran's mid-March parliamentary elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karimi|first=Nasser|title=Iran shuts 5 websites|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=15 February 2008|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-02-14-2988420128_x.htm|accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roozonline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.roozonline.com/2007/07/post_3275.php|title= دادستان تهران: علت پیشرفت من "تقواح" است|date=26 July 2007|accessdate=30 May 2008|newspaper=Roozonline|first=Mazyar|last=Radmanesh|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080602000906/http://www.roozonline.com/2007/07/post_3275.php|archivedate=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations visit===
In 2006, Mortazavi was sent to [[Geneva]] as part of the Iranian delegation to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], a decision that was met with some criticism at home and abroad, due to Mortazavi's controversial human rights record. [[Human Rights Watch]] urged Iran to remove him from the delegation, and other countries to decline to meet with the Iranian delegation until his removal.&lt;ref name="ghaemi"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ghaemi|first=Hadi|title=For Iran, the Man Is the Message|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=29 June 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/29/opinion/29ghaemi.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Saeed+Mortazavi&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin|accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortazevi's first official meeting was with the also-controversial [[Zimbabwe]]an minister of justice [[Patrick Chinamasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alavi|first=Nasrin|title=Tehran's red card to human rights|publisher=Open Democracy|date=23 June 2006|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy-irandemocracy/human_rights_3676.jsp|accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortazavi took advantage of his position on the delegation to advocate the right of access to high technology, including nuclear power, for all nations. He also warned the council that it should avoid being manipulated into doing the bidding of powerful states, and that it should investigate human rights abuses perpetrated by western powers, notably human rights abuses in the [[War on Terror]], [[extraordinary rendition]], [[Islamophobia]], criticism of the [[Islam and clothing|Islamic dress code and veil]], and the suppression of the freedom of speech of [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mortazavi: Iran intends to closely cooperate with UN Human Rights Council |newspaper=[[Islamic Republic News Agency]] |date=20 June 2006 |url=http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-22/0606209078162916.htm |accessdate=1 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702000616/http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-22/0606209078162916.htm |archivedate=2 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student protesters===
In 2008, it was reported that Mortazavi had detained students due to protest against [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s government; the students alleged abuse while in jail.&lt;ref name="Roozonline"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.roozonline.com/english/archives/2007/08/judiciary_orders_students_to_s.html|title=Judiciary Orders Students to Solitary Confinement|date=23 August 2007|accessdate=30 May 2008|work=Roozonline|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080502044406/http://www.roozonline.com/english/archives/2007/08/judiciary_orders_students_to_s.html |archivedate=2 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RadiofreeEurope"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/07/A660AAF8-5B7B-49C9-85FB-47BA92942B83.html|title=Families Of Detained Students Describe Abuse In Prison|date=25 July 2007|accessdate=30 May 2008|work=Radio Free Europe|first=Golnaz|last=Esfandiarii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iranfocus"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iranfocus.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=11388|title=Iran university students demand release of jailed activists|date=27 May 2007|accessdate=30 May 2008|work=Iran Focus}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been involved in more contentious cases since then as well. Mortazavi was a prosecutor on the cases of [[Roxana Saberi]], an American-Iranian journalist accused of spying, and Iranian-Canadian blogger [[Hossein Derakhshan]], whose posts were critical of the establishment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/News/Iran+president+urges+fair+treatment+writers/1513344/story.html |accessdate=25 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707034800/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/News/Iran+president+urges+fair+treatment+writers/1513344/story.html |archivedate=7 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrests of 2009 election protesters===
During the 2009 [[2009 Iranian election protests|election dispute]] across Iran, Mortazavi has been active in suppressing the protests. He has signed arrest warrants for reformers, such as [[Saeed Hajjarian]], and is believed to be instrumental in the more than 600 arrests that have occurred across the nation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In early 2010 the Iranian parliament released a report identifying Saeed Mortazavi as "the main culprit in the scandal" over the [[Kahrizak detention center]]. The report stated that 147 prisoners arrested for participating in [[2009 Iranian election protests|demonstrations]] against irregularities in the 2009 election of President [[Ahmadinejad]] had been "held in a 70-square-metre room for four days without proper ventilation, heating and food on Mortazavi's orders". Three of the inmates died, including [[Mohsen Rouhalamini]], the son of a "distinguished government scientist."&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

Mortazavi had maintained that the prisoners had "died from meningitis" and that "inoculation kits had been sent to detention centres" to stop the condition from spreading. This claim was dismissed by an examining doctor, [[Ramin Pourandarjani]], who refused to certify it as the cause of death until he was arrested and forced to do so. Pourandarjani later died mysteriously after being charged with failing to properly treat the prisoners. The report rejected Mortazavi claim.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

The report however also "strongly rejected" reports that rape or sexual assault had taken place in the prison. Opposition websites have reported rapes at the prison including the rape of a pro-regime photographer, Saeed Sadaghi, which allegedly led to the closing of the prison. Sadaghi is said to have been accidentally swept up in the mass arrests and held at Kahrizak after which he complained to [[Supreme Leader]] [[Khamenei]] of his treatment. Khamenei later closed the prison.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/10/iran-prisoners-abuse-jail Iran's parliament exposes abuse of opposition prisoners at Tehran jail], Robert Tait, 10 January 2010, The Guardian.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deputy prosecutor-general===
On 31 August 2009, Mortazavi was demoted to deputy prosecutor-general - "one of six deputies for prosecutor-general [[Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i]]" - by the new judiciary chief Ayatollah [[Sadeq Larijani]]. Observers disagree over whether the post was a promotion to "deputy to the nation's top prosecutor," with "a fancy title and protection from future legal action," or "a demotion" that strips him of powers he had enjoyed, such as the ability to order an arrest or halt to political activities.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2009/08/iran-tehran-prosecutor-promoted-into-obscurity.html Tehran prosecutor 'promoted' into obscurity?|31 August 2009] Retrieved 3 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed Mortazavi is facing a potential investigation into his conduct of post vote trials.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Task Force Against Smuggling===
In 2010 Mortazavi was appointed head of Iran's Task Force Against Smuggling, shortly after he was discredited by the release of a report by the Iranian parliament naming him as the man largely responsible for abuse of political prisoners committed in July 2009 by state security forces at the [[Kahrizak detention center]].&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;  The appointment was seen by some as an example of President [[Ahmadinejad]]'s loyalty to his "dwindling" band of core supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/01/29/irans_bubble_boys Iran's Bubble Boys] BY GENEIVE ABDO|29 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Security Organization===
Mortazavi was "head of Iran's Social Security Organization", a presidentially-appointed post.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite journal|last=Esfandiari|first=Golnaz|author2=Mohammad Zarghami |title=In Iran, Trials That are Just for Show|journal=The Atlantic|date=27 February 2013|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/02/in-iran-trials-that-are-just-for-show/273570/|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, Iran's parliament successfully "lobbied to have him removed" from this position, but following that, Ahmadinejad reappointed him as head of the organization in a "caretaker role".&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;{{cite news|last=Petersen|first=Freya|title=Subscribe to Freya Petersen on Facebook Add Freya Petersen to your circles Iran: Saeed Mortazavi, ally of Ahmadinejad, released after mystery arrest|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/middle-east/iran/130205/iran-mahmoud-ahmadinejad-Saeed-Mortazavi-notorious-prosecutor-butcher|newspaper=Global Post|accessdate=28 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=casey&gt;{{cite news|last=Casey|first=Mary|title=Iranian police arrest ex-prosecutor and Ahmadinejad ally|url=http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/02/05/iranian_police_arrest_ex_prosecutor_and_ahmadinejad_ally|date=5 February 2013|newspaper=Foreign Policy|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 2010, Saeed Mortazavi and two judges were suspended from office after a judicial investigation into the deaths of three men from torture&lt;ref name=payback/&gt; detained on his orders following the controversial June 2009 presidential election. This stripped him of his immunity as a member of the judiciary.&lt;ref name=falls&gt;{{cite web|last=Memarian|first=Omid|title=Feared Iranian Prosecutor Falls From Grace|url=http://mianeh.net/article/feared-iranian-prosecutor-falls-grace|work=4 September 2010|publisher=mianeh|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 February 2013 a statement posted on the Tehran prosecutor's website announced Mortazavi's arrest.&lt;ref name=NBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Iran prosecutor Mortazavi arrested: statement|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/50701684/ns/business-stocks_and_economy/|date=5 February 2013|newspaper=Reuters|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later he was released. No explanation was given for either the detention or his release at the time.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;

The trial of Mortazavi and two co-defendants began on 26 February 2013. Charges against Mortazavi and his former deputy Ali Akbar Heydarifar, and former Judge Hassan Zareh Dehnavi include unlawful arrest, filing a false report, and assisting in the filing of a false report. "There are conflicting reports on whether the three also face murder charges."&lt;ref name=payback&gt;{{cite web|last=Esfandiari|first=Golnaz|title=Political Payback Or Justice For Tehran's 'Butcher Of The Press'?|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/iran-mortazavi-trial-political-payback/24914453.html|publisher=RFERL|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the opening day of proceedings, the presiding Judge—Siamak Modir Khorasani—announced the trial would be held behind closed doors.&lt;ref name=payback/&gt;

The lack of transparency of the trial has been criticized by [[Shirin Ebadi]] and others.  According to Ebadi 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The accused in this case, particularly former prosecutor Said Mortazavi, received direct orders from officials above him - including the [[Ali Khamenei|Leader]]. Therefore, [the authorities] would never dare put him on trial in public."&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to journalists Golnaz Esfandiari and Mohammad Zarghami and other sources,&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;&lt;ref name=payback/&gt; the trial is "widely seen as an indirect move against Ahmadinejad", since he had "used Mortazavi to bring corruption charges against his political rivals" in the past.&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt; The arrest came a day after Ahmadinejad "released a secret video in parliament where Mortazavi allegedly discussed a fraudulent business deal, implicating Iran's highly influential [[Larijani]] family".&lt;ref name=casey/&gt;

There have been various '''movements within [[Canada]] for secession'''.

==Movements seeking independence from Canada==

===Newfoundland &amp; Labrador===
[[Image:Newfoundland Tricolour.svg|right|thumb|175px|Independence flag of Newfoundland and Labrador, the [[Newfoundland Tricolour]].]]
There is a secessionist movement in Newfoundland based on its unique history, and as a result of its grievances and broken promises with both the federal government and the government of Quebec. Prior to 1949 the area was a self-governing Dominion ([[Dominion of Newfoundland]]). "The root of our trouble is centred in the relationship between the two countries, between Newfoundland as a country and Canada" according to James Halley, a former lawyer involved in negotiating a deal to get Newfoundland into Canada in 1949. According to a July 2003 report, secessionism was on the rise&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2003/07/01/nfld_separatists030701.html CBC.ca 1 July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a "flag flap" occurred when the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador removed all Canadian flags from government buildings and raised provincial flags instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/12/24/williams041224.html CBC.ca 24 December 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions have since eased; however, a non-organized movement has emerged amongst citizens and the ability of potential premiers to appeal to a strong sense of Newfoundland nationalism is imperative to forming a government.

The secessionist movement in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] is most commonly associated with a flag under several names, including the "Pink, White and Green", "Flag of the Republic of Newfoundland &amp; Labrador", or officially as the [[Newfoundland Tricolour]].

===Nova Scotia===
Shortly after the Confederation of three British colonies ([[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and the [[Province of Canada]]) to form the [[Dominion]] of Canada in 1867, opponents of Confederation in Nova Scotia began promoting the withdrawal of that province from the new confederation.  The [[Anti-Confederation Party]] won 18 of the 19 Nova Scotia seats in the new [[House of Commons of Canada]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1867|1867 general election]], and 36 of the 38 seats in the Nova Scotia legislature, but did not succeed in achieving independence for Nova Scotia.

In 1990, just before the failure of the [[Meech Lake Accord]], then-[[premier]] [[John Buchanan]] predicted [[Nova Scotia]] and the rest of [[Atlantic Canada]] would have to join the [[United States]] if the accord failed.&lt;ref name="rowley19900503"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-05-03/news/9002050757_1_newfoundland-premier-clyde-wells-meech-lake-quebec | title=Quebec Crisis Creates Talk About 4 Canadian Provinces Joining U.S. | work=Chicago Tribune | date=1990-05-03 | accessdate=September 18, 2012 | author=Rowley, Storer H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quebec===
{{Main|Quebec sovereignty movement}}
{{further|Republic of Lower Canada}}

The Quebec sovereignty movement seeks independence from Canada for the province of [[Quebec]]. This movement often seeks what has been termed "sovereignty-association", which is sovereignty for Quebec within an economic association or union with the rest of Canada. Since the [[Quiet Revolution]], the many available options have garnered support from Quebecers.

The sovereignty movement has spawned a variety of political parties, such as the [[Parti Québécois]], a [[social democracy|social democratic]] [[political party]] at the provincial level in Quebec that has governed the province for various periods since 1976, and the [[Bloc Québécois]], which had four of Quebec's 75 seats in the [[House of Commons of Canada]], but until recently regularly won the majority of seats in Quebec. This party aims to promote Quebec's sovereignty and purports to "defend the interests of Quebec" at the federal level of government.

The [[Front de libération du Québec]] (FLQ), was a [[terrorist organization]] in the 1960s and early 1970s that used violence to promote independence for Quebec. Although they both advocated a sovereigntist agenda, the FLQ and its violent tactics were denounced by the Parti Québécois.

Since the Quiet Revolution, sovereigntist sentiments have been stoked somewhat by the [[Canada Act 1982|patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982]] which was introduced without the consent of the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] and by numerous failed attempts at constitutional reform, which have sought to address Quebec's "[[distinct society]]". Two provincial [[referendum]]s, in 1980 and 1995, rejected proposals for sovereignty, with majorities of 60% and 50.6%, respectively. Given the narrow federalist victory in 1995, a reference was made by the [[Jean Chrétien|Chrétien]] government to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in 1996 [[Reference re Secession of Quebec|regarding the legality of a unilateral secession of Quebec]]. This resulted in the passage of the [[Clarity Act]] in 2000.

===Western Canada===
The [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]], under the leadership of [[Louis Riel]] staged the [[Red River Rebellion]] in Manitoba against Canada in 1870, and the [[North-West Rebellion]] in Saskatchewan in 1885. At the time, this part of the [[Western Canada|West]] was relatively independent, francophone, culturally distinct, and facing the stress of dealing with aggressive colonization by [[English Canadian|Anglophones]] from [[Ontario]].

Numerous political parties in the western provinces, believing there to be no other solution for stemming apparent "[[Western alienation]]" by [[Central Canada]], have sought independence. These movements are strongest in [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]], but lesser ones exist in [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]]. These movements have also assumed that Canada's northern territories ([[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]], and [[Nunavut]]) would also be a part of a new Western Canadian union. Parties advocating Western separation include the [[Western Canada Concept]], the [[Western Independence Party]], and the [[Western Block Party]]. These parties have not achieved much success, however.

In the early 1980s, in [[Saskatchewan]], the [[Unionest Party]] advocated the western provinces join the [[United States]].

In 1995, [[Premier of Saskatchewan]] [[Roy Romanow]] secretly formed a committee on consequences if Quebec seceded. The most seriously studied option was strengthening Saskatchewan's relationships with other western provinces because, Romanow said in 2014, Ontario would become closer to the US economically and Atlantic Canada would become "an island". Other possibilities included also seceding from Canada, and joining the US. Romanow said that predecessor [[Allan Blakeney]] had similarly studied options for Saskatchewan during the 1980 Quebec referendum.&lt;ref name="warren20140826"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Secret Romanow group mulled secession |last=Warren |first=Jeremy |date=2014-08-26 |newspaper=The StarPhoenix |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829140952/http://www.thestarphoenix.com/news/Secret+Romanow+group+mulled+secession/10148654/story.html |archive-date=2014-08-29 | url=http://www.thestarphoenix.com/news/Secret+Romanow+group+mulled+secession/10148654/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 2003, the [[Western Independence Party of Saskatchewan]] (WIPS) was created [https://web.archive.org/web/20070103215008/http://www.wipsk.com/] and registered as a Provincial Party, running candidates in 17 ridings in the [[Saskatchewan general election, 2003]]

A poll by the ''[[Western Standard]]'' conducted from June 29, 2005, to July 5, 2005, finds 35.6% of residents of the four provinces think "Western Canadians should begin to explore the idea of forming their own country." [http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1123588600678_121/?hub=Canada]

====Alberta====

{{Main|Alberta separatism}}

The [[Alberta Independence Party]] promoted independence for the province of Alberta, either on its own or in union with the other western provinces, in the 1990s, but it is now defunct. The [[Separation Party of Alberta]] nominated candidates in the [[Alberta general election, 2004|2004 Alberta provincial election]].

====Manitoba====
In January–February 1868, a small group of settlers declared a '''Republic of Caledonia''', later the [[Republic of Manitobah]], at Portage-la-Prairie in [[Hudson's Bay Company]] land that was to be incorporated into Canada.  These settlers aimed to use this declaration to obtain favourable terms (for themselves) for the entry of the area into Confederation.  The declaration was not recognized by Canadian or British authorities, and the republic soon collapsed.

====British Columbia and Yukon====
Shortly after joining Confederation, British Columbia threatened to secede after the initial failure of the transcontinental railway promises which were one of its conditions for joining Canada.  During the disputes over what led to the [[Columbia River Treaty]], BC Premier [[WAC Bennett]] threatened to take BC out of Canada - and to take Yukon as well - if Ottawa and Washington would not accede to his demands.
 
There is an ongoing informal movement{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} in British Columbia to create a separate country of [[Cascadia (independence movement)|Cascadia]].

While Yukon lacks a formal separatist movement or party, there is an element of dissatisfaction in the territory as well.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  However, as anticipation of a Conservative government in Ottawa built, the number of Yukoners that would be in favour of secession (if it included British Columbia and Alberta) has steadily dropped from a high of 18% in August 2005 to a mere 8% by January 2006.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Many First Nations politicians and some First Nations in BC, nearly all claiming and still technically holding [[unceded territory|unceded]] sovereignty, want varying degrees of autonomy, with some asserting outright independence.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The [[Vancouver Island Party]] is the first secessionist movement that aims to secede from British Columbia and become a separate province by 2021, instead of leaving Canada like other secession movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zussman|first1=Richard|title=New political party pushing for province of Vancouver Island|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-political-party-pushing-for-province-of-vancouver-island-1.3647482|accessdate=23 June 2016|date=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other movements==

===Republic of Madawaska===
{{Main|Republic of Madawaska}}

The Republic of Madawaska occupied what is now the northwest corner of [[New Brunswick]], and lies partially in [[Quebec]] and the American state of [[Maine]].  The origins of the so-called republic lie in the 1783 [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]], which established the border between the [[United States of America]] and the British North American colonies. The Madawaska region remained in dispute between Britain and the US until 1842. In Canada, Madawaska was considered part of Quebec until the 1850s, when the border with New Brunswick was modified.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell map of 1850 shows Madawaska in QC, whereas Mitchell map of 1860 shows it in NB&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called "Republic" is now a purely ceremonial entity.

==In popular culture==
Occasionally regions of Canada have declared themselves to be "independent" in a non-serious, satirical or promotional way. These "movements" are taken for what they are and not considered secessionist.

===Republic of Rathnelly===
The [[Rathnelly]] neighbourhood in [[Toronto]] made headlines in 1967, while celebrating Canada's 100th birthday. During the celebrations, Rathnelly residents playfully declared themselves as a republic independent of Canada. To mark their independence, the "Republic of Rathnelly" elected a queen, organized a parade, and issued Republic of Rathnelly passports to everyone in the neighbourhood.  The new nation conscripted all 8- to 14-year-old citizens to form a militia, known as the Rathnelly Irregulars, and armed them with 1,000 helium balloons (the Rathnelly "air force").   The "Republic of Rathnelly" continues to hold annual street parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Globe and Mail |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/home-and-garden/real-estate/where-are-torontos-prime-real-estate-pockets/article11053637/ |title=Where are Toronto’s prime real estate pockets? |author=Carolyn Ireland |date=2013-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kingdom of L'Anse-Saint-Jean===
A [[millennium|millennial]] tourist-attracting project involved the town of [[L'Anse-Saint-Jean, Quebec]], "declaring" itself an independent monarchy. The project, which enjoyed a certain amount of media coverage, was cheerfully admitted to be tongue-in-cheek.

The '''Socialist Campaign Group of Labour MPs''', often known as the Campaign Group, is a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]], [[democratic socialist]] grouping of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]]. It was formed in December 1982 as an alternative Parliamentary left-wing group to the [[Tribune Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Seyd, ''The Rise and Fall of the Labour Left'' (1987). London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; The Campaign Group, as it is commonly known, is often considered on the [[hard left]] of the Labour Party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDonnell|first1=John|title=Campaign Group's popular policies|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jul/23/labour.comment|accessdate=24 October 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been highly critical of [[New Labour]].

Before 2017, the Campaign Group was only open to [[backbench]] MPs; this was reformed to allow all Member of Parliament to be members, but restricted office holders to non-Cabinet/Shadow Cabinet members. It maintains close links with [[Momentum (organisation)| Momentum]] and other left wing campaign groups within and outside of the party.

==Origins==
The Socialist Campaign Group was founded in 1982 due to fissures in the Labour left, traditionally organised around the [[Tribune Group]]. [[Tony Benn|Tony Benn's]] decision to challenge [[Denis Healey]] for the Deputy Leadership of the Labour Party in 1981 was heavily criticised by Labour's leader, [[Michael Foot]]&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Scott Crines, ''Michael Foot and the Labour Leadership'' (2011), p. 136. Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;, who had long been associated with the Labour left and Tribune Group. Tribune Group member and future Labour leader [[Neil Kinnock]] led a number of Labour MPs to support [[John Silkin]] in the deputy leadership election and abstain in the run-off between Healey and Benn. This sowed the seeds for a split in the left between a "[[soft left]]" supportive of Foot's leadership and a dissenting "[[hard left]]" organised principally around Benn.&lt;ref&gt;Dianne Hayter, ''Fightback!: Labour's Traditional Right in the 1970s and 1980s'' (2005), p. 21. Manchester: Manchester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Campaign Group would go on to back [[Eric Heffer]] and [[Michael Meacher]] in their unsuccessful bids for the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1983|leadership]] and [[Labour Party (UK) deputy leadership election, 1983|deputy leadership]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Seyd, ''The Rise and Fall of the Labour Left'' (1987), p. 223. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; The Campaign Group subsequently organised itself around opposition to the direction the party took under the leadership of Kinnock and his successors.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley, ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organization'' (200), p. 931. London: A&amp;C Black&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Socialist Campaign Group's founding members were [[Norman Atkinson]], [[Tony Benn]], [[Ronald Brown (Scottish politician)|Ron Brown]], [[Dennis Canavan]], [[Bob Cryer]], [[Donald Dixon, Baron Dixon|Don Dixon]], [[Stuart Holland]], [[Les Huckfield]], [[Bob Litherland]], [[Joan Maynard]], [[William McKelvey|Willie McKelvey]], [[Andrew McMahon (politician)|Andy McMahon]], [[Bob McTaggart]], [[Michael Meacher]], [[Ray Powell (Welsh politician)|Ray Powell]], [[Reg Race]], [[Allan Roberts (politician)|Allan Roberts]], [[Ernie Roberts]], [[Ernie Ross]], [[Dennis Skinner]] and [[John Tilley (English politician)|John Tilley]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Seyd, ''The Rise and Fall of the Labour Left'' (1987), p. 222.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A large statue representing the concept of Liberty surmounts the pedestal. Eighteen large bronze stars circling the pedestal below this statue represent the eighteen Union states with buried dead. Four statues are located at each corner near the base. They represent War, History, Peace, and Plenty. '''War''' is represented by a statue of an American soldier who recounts the story of the battle to History. In turn, '''History''' records, with stylus and tablet, the achievements of the battle and the names of the honored dead. A statue of an American mechanic and his tools illustrates '''Peace'''. '''Plenty''' is a female figure with a sheaf of wheat and the fruits of the earth that typify peace and abundance as the soldier's crowning triumph.&lt;ref name=hscl/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4595">'''''Sozialistischer Schutzbund''''' ('Socialist Protection League', abbreviated '''SSB''') was a paramilitary formation in [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]], linked to the [[Social Democratic Party of Saarland]] (SPS).&lt;ref&gt;Langkau-Alex, Ursula.

Röhrig, 1987. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r4/&gt; 

==Foundation==
SSB was formed in 1933 by the Saar organization of the German ''[[Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold]]'', following the ban of the German mother organization in Germany proper in March/April 1933.&lt;ref name=p1/&gt;&lt;ref name=p2&gt;{{cite book|author=ZurMühlen, Patrik von|title="Schlagt Hitler an der Saar!": Abstimmungskampf, Emigration und Widerstand im Saargebiet 1933 - 1935|place=Bonn|publisher=Verl.

The name SSB was adopted on June 17, 1933.&lt;ref name=p1&gt;Paul, Gerhard, and Bernhard Schossig. ''Die Andere Geschichte: Geschichte von unten, Spurensicherung, ökologische Geschichte, Geschichtswerkstätten''. Köln: Bund-Verlag, 1986. pp. 101-102. {{ISBN|3766309463}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; Through the choice of name the organization manifested that the ideological compromise of the ''Reichsbanner'' had ended.&lt;ref name=p3/&gt;&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; 

==Leadership==
Frank had gained experience as an organizer in ''Reichsbanner'' and the [[Iron Front]]. However, in the background the party chairman Max Braun acted as the ''de facto'' leader of the organization.&lt;ref name=p5/&gt;&lt;ref name=p6/&gt; Braun would inspire many SSB youth activists fighting against a [[National Socialism|National Socialist]] take-over in the Saar territory.&lt;ref name=p5&gt;Mallmann, Klaus-Michael, Gerhard Paul, and Hans-Walter Herrmann.

Bonn: Dietz Nachfolger, 1995. p. 72. {{ISBN|3801250121}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinz Kühn]] (who later became the [[Minister-President]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]) was the leader of the youth formation of SSB.&lt;ref name=p6/&gt;

==Organization==
The set-up of the organization followed that of ''Reichsbanner'' and the Austrian ''[[Republikanischer Schutzbund]]''.&lt;ref name=r4/&gt; SSB had its headquarters in [[Sulzbach, Saarland|Sulzbach]].&lt;ref name=p1/&gt; There are no definitive records of the size of the organization.&lt;ref name=p2b/&gt; According to one account it counted some 200-300 men in its ranks.&lt;ref name=p1/&gt;

SSB sought to circumvent the ban on uniforms imposed by the Government Commission, and its members wore  green shirt, black pants and boots at public appearances.&lt;ref name=p2b/&gt; SSB possessed some light handguns and some ammunition, but lacked regular weaponry.&lt;ref name=p2b&gt;{{cite book|author=ZurMühlen, Patrik von|title=Schlagt Hitler an der Saar!": Abstimmungskampf, Emigration und Widerstand im Saargebiet 1933 - 1935|place=Bonn|publisher=Verl. Neue Gesellschaft|year=1979|page=43|isbn=387831308X|edition=German|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
SSB acted as security forces at mass meetings, and during election campaigns smaller teams of SSB fighters confronted the National Socialist groups.&lt;ref name=p1/&gt; SSB activists also acted as body guards for Max Braun, who faced death threats at the time.&lt;ref name="p6"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul, Gerhard, and Klaus-Michael Mallmann|title=Milieus und Widerstand: eine Verhaltensgeschichte der Gesellschaft im Nationalsozialismus|place=Bonn|publisher=Dietz|year=1995|pages=214, 216|isbn=3801250121|edition=German|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
A number of the Saar German fighters in the [[International Brigades]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] were former SSB members.&lt;ref name=r4&gt;{{cite book|author=Röhr, Werner, and Brigitte Berlekamp|title=Terror, Herrschaft und Alltag im Nationalsozialismus: Probleme einer Sozialgeschichte des deutschen Faschismus|place=Munster|publisher=Westfälisches Dampfboot|year=1997|page=70|isbn=3929586444|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1792">'''Specialty Doctor''' is a new title for senior, career grade [[physician|doctor]]s working in [[hospital]]s in the UK NHS. The previous grades of Staff Grade and Specialty Doctor were subsumed into this new grade when it was introduced in 2008.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.nhsemployers.org/PayAndContracts/MedicalandDentalContracts/StaffAndAssociateSpecialistDrs/Pages/AssociateSpecialists-Homepage.aspx NHS Employers website] &lt;/ref&gt;

There are more than 9,000 Specialty Doctors in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ic.nhs.uk/statistics-and-data-collections/workforce/nhs-staff-numbers/nhs-staff-2000--2010-medical-and-dental NHS Information Centre Website ]&lt;/ref&gt; and you are very likely to be seen by one if admitted to the care of a hospital specialist. Most report to a [[consultant]] but have many years of specialty experience and they are employed on a contract similar to that for consultants. Specialty Doctors usually perform more direct [[patient care]] than their consultant colleagues as they are not normally involved in [[management]], yet will generally have more experience and skills than the majority of their colleagues in the training grades.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4332">The '''state governments in Malaysia''' are the governments ruling the [[States of Malaysia|13 states]] in the federation of [[Malaysia]]. All 13 states adopts the [[Westminster system|Westminster]] [[Parliamentary system]] and each has a unicameral [[State Legislative Assemblies of Malaysia|state legislative assembly]]. The state government structure in all 13 states is similar to the government system of the [[Government of Malaysia|federal government]] of Malaysia except for minor native judiciary powers in Sabah and Sarawak and that the state legislatures consist of only a [[Unicameralism|single chamber]].

==Heads of state==
The heads of state for the 9 monarchical states are their respective monarchs (7 out of them [[Sultan]]s). The 9 states are [[Johor]], [[Negeri Sembilan]], [[Pahang]], [[Selangor]], [[Perak]], [[Kedah]], [[Terengganu]], [[Kelantan]] and [[Perlis]]. The heads of state for [[Penang]], [[Malacca]], [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] are their respective [[Yang di-Pertua Negeri]] sometimes referred to as governor. All 13 heads of state forms the [[Conference of Rulers]] but only the 9 monarchs can become the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (King of Malaysia). The role of the heads of state are largely ceremonial other than the power to appoint the chief minister or menteri besar (according to the state constitution) and to withhold consent to dissolve the state legislature. The heads of state are required by [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]] to give their approval or assent to every legislation passed by the state legislature.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Heads of government==

{{Main|Chief Ministers in Malaysia}}

The Head of Government for the 13 states in Malaysia is ruled by either a Minister ([[Menteri Besar]]) or Chief Minister ([[Ketua Menteri]]), depending on whether their Head of Government is a Sultan or Yang di-Pertua Negeri.&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @ Ibrahim, &amp; Nor Fadzlina Nawi. (2012). ''Principles of Public Administration: Malaysian Perspectives.'' Kuala Lumpur: Pearson Publishers. {{ISBN|978-967-349-233-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Powers and functions==

Pursuant to Article 73-79 of the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Federal Constitution]], the state legislature is empowered to legislate on matters such as land matters, public works, local government, agriculture and forestry, Islamic law and public holidays. Pursuant to Article 80 of the Federal Constitution, the state executive in turn has administrative power over all matters which the state legislature may legislate under the constitution. [[Federalism in Malaysia]] is quite strong whereby the federal government retains by far more powers compared to the respective state governments. This is also reflected in the budget allocation towards the state and federal government.&lt;ref name="pm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penangmonthly.com/what%E2%80%99s-in-the-budget-for-state-governments/|title=What’s in the budget for state governments?|last=Tricia Yeoh|date=14 November 2011|publisher=Penang Monthly|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Future of Food''''' is a 2004 American [[documentary film]] written and directed by [[Jerry Garcia#Personal life|Deborah Koons Garcia]] to describe an investigation into unlabeled, patented, [[Genetically modified organism|genetically engineered]] foods sold in grocery stores in the [[United States]] for the past decade.&lt;ref name="The New York Times 09-14-04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Denver Post"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Hollywood Reporter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety 01-03-05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="San Francisco Chronicle 09-30-05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Post"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Daily News"/&gt; In addition to the US, there is a focus on [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="The Boston Globe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slant 09-01-05"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gonzales|first1=Ed|title=The Future of Food|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-future-of-food|accessdate=29 December 2015|publisher=[[Slant (magazine)|Slant]]|date=1 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AV Club 09-14-05"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Tasha|title=The Future Of Food|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/40641|accessdate=29 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202162135/http://www.avclub.com/content/node/40641|archivedate=2 December 2008|publisher=[[The A.V.

==Synopsis==
The films voices opinions of farmers in disagreement with the food industry, and details the impacts on their lives and livelihoods from this new technology, and the market and political forces that are changing what people eat. The farmers state that they are held legally responsible for their crops being invaded by "company-owned" genes. The film generally opposes the patenting of living organisms, and describes the disappearance of traditional cultural practices.

It also criticizes the cost of a globalized food industry on human lives around the world. It states that international companies are gradually driving farmers off their land in many countries, that [[monoculture]] farming might lead to global dependence of the human race on food corporations, and that there is an increased risk of [[Ecological crisis|ecological disasters]] caused by a reduction of [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]]. For example, the local varieties of Mexican corn are being replaced by subsidized US corn.

The film also describes a fear of major losses to local food systems and states that these gene banks will no longer be available to save global industrial agriculture when a new pest arises, and that if they spread to plants in the wild, [[terminator gene]]s could lead to a widespread catastrophe affecting the food supply. Legal stories reported by the film related how a number of farmers in North America have been sued by the [[Monsanto|Monsanto Company]].&lt;ref name="The Denver Post"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Hollywood Reporter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Boston Globe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Book 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Costa|first1=Temra|title=Farmer Jane: Women Changing the Way We Eat|year=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Deborah Koons Garcia|isbn=1423605624|pages=68–72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bfVXaBM4gMkC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=%22The+Future+of+Food%22+Deborah+Koons+Garcia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx0ojxwYDKAhUN-2MKHQjdBlgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Future%20of%20Food%22%20Deborah%20Koons%20Garcia&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seattle Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="San Francisco Chronicle 11-04-04"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ness|first1=Carol|title=Fighting for the future of food / Deborah Koons Garcia's film documents how genetically engineered foods slipped into our supply|url=http://www.sfgate.com/living/article/Fighting-for-the-future-of-food-Deborah-Koons-2637592.php|accessdate=29 December 2015|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=7 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="North Bay Bohemian 05-11-05"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scheide|first1=R.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has score of 81% based on reviews from 26 critics. The websites consensus states: "The Future of Food is a one-sided, but revelatory documentary about the dangers of genetically modified food."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=staff|title=THE FUTURE OF FOOD (2005)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_future_of_food/ |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date= 18 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wesley Morris]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' made a tongue-in-cheek comparison to the horror genre by writing "Anyone looking for a more practical horror film than ''[[The Fog]]'' should try ''The Future of Food,'' a new documentary about the slippery slope of genetic modification in agriculture",&lt;ref name="The Boston Globe"/&gt; and shared that in 1998 Monsanto publicly abrogated any responsibility for ensuring the long-term safety of their GMO products and passed that responsibility to the [[Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref name="The Boston Globe"&gt;{{cite news|authorlink= Wesley Morris |last1 = Morris |first1= Wesley]]|title=A credible case against genetically altered food|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2005/10/21/a_credible_case_against_genetically_altered_food/|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=21 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film "is a disturbing—if somewhat bland and partisan—study of agribusiness' aggressive push for genetically-modified food,"&lt;ref name="Variety 01-03-05"/&gt; and expressed "it's a shame writer-director Deborah Koons Garcia opts to show only one side of the argument".&lt;ref name="Variety 01-03-05"/&gt;  They also felt that seen as "a rallying cry for organic and slow-food fans everywhere",&lt;ref name="Variety 01-03-05"/&gt; the film would find a large audience "in public interest tube play and activist vid circulation."&lt;ref name="Variety 01-03-05"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koehler|first1=Robert|title=Review: 'The Future of Food'|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/reviews/the-future-of-food-1200528865/|accessdate=29 December 2015|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=3 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film a "sober, far-reaching polemic against genetically modified foods" with its good guys and bad guys clearly identified.&lt;ref name="The New York Times 09-14-04"&gt;{{cite news|authorlink= Stephen Holden |last=Holden |first=Stephen]]|title=When Food From the Laboratory Leaves a Bitter Taste|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/2005/09/14/movies/14food.html|accessdate=29 December 2015|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=14 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Georgia Straight]]'' speaks toward [[Jerry Garcia#Death|Deborah Koons Garcia]] advocacy and her opposition to the genetic engineering done by [[Monsanto]]. While noting the film's beginning awkwardly with Koons-Garcia's pointing the finger of shame at the political motivation of Monsanto, they concluded it "gets slightly more hopeful as it goes along".&lt;ref name="The Georgia Straight 12-01-05"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eisner|first1=Ken|title=review: ''The Future of Food''|url=https://www.straight.com/article/the-future-of-food|accessdate=29 December 2015|publisher=[[The Georgia Straight]]|date=1 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote the filmmaker "has taken a complex subject and made it digestible for anyone who cares about what they put into their stomachs," but also noted that "Monsanto will attack Garcia's documentary as a piece of unbalanced journalism".&lt;ref name="San Francisco Chronicle 09-30-05"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Curiel|first1=Jonathan|title=Opening today: 'The Future of Food'|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/FILM-CLIPS-Opening-today-2605644.php#flick3|accessdate=29 December 2015|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=30 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria Gilman of [[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]] criticized the lack of balance in the film, noting that Garcia defended farmers being deprived of the ability to raise non-GMO [[canola oil]] despite canola oil itself being a creation of a sort of "genetic engineering" (not to be confused with [[Genetic modification|GM technologies]]) using the science at the time.&lt;ref name="Chemical &amp; Engineering News 03-19-05"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilman|first1=Victoria|title=review: 'The Future of Food'|url=https://pubs.acs.org/cen/reelscience/reviews/future_food/|accessdate=29 December 2015|publisher=[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]|date=19 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organic Consumers Association]] quoted a lengthy article in ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'',&lt;ref name="Wired 07-08-04"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silverman|first1=Jason|title=GMO-Food Foes Turn to Film|url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/07/64089|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|date=8 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for OCA, its author Jason Silverman wrote the film "is Inspiring the Anti-GE Movement in America".&lt;ref name="Organic Consumers Association 2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Silverman|first1=Jason|title=New Film "The Future of Food" is Inspiring the Anti-GE Movement in America|url=https://www.organicconsumers.org/old_articles/biod/film091004.php|publisher=[[Organic Consumers Association]]|accessdate=30 December 2015|date=8 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In their later review, OCA called the film "an engaging and lucid presentation of not only the science of genetic engineering, but of the people and the politics behind what looks to be a pitched battle to control the global food supply".&lt;ref name="Organic Consumers Association"/&gt;  They shared how documentary filmmaker Deborah Koons Garcia spent 3 years making her film, based on an idea which came to her after her educational series ''All About Babies'' and stemming from a long time concern she has over food production and safety. Her goal was to produce a cross between [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' and [[Gillo Pontecorvo]]'s ''[[The Battle of Algiers|Battle of Algiers]]''. In praising the project, they wrote "In less skillful hands, a film about genetically modified (GM) food could have been tough sledding for regular folks to sit through."&lt;ref name="Organic Consumers Association"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caruso|first1=Denise|title=New "Future of Food" Movie is a Hit!|url=https://www.organicconsumers.org/old_articles/ge/future-of-food.php|publisher=[[Organic Consumers Association]]|accessdate=30 December 2015|date=23 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York Post]]'' called the film "enlightening", noting it "takes dead aim at genetically altered food, [by] arguing that grocery shelves are filled with potentially dangerous items."&lt;ref name="New York Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Musetto|first1=V.A.|title='FOOD’ A RECIPE FOR RUIN|url=https://nypost.com/2005/09/15/food-a-recipe-for-ruin/|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=[[New York Post]]|date=15 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York Daily News]]''gave the film 3 stars and spoke toward the film's tone, writing "Garcia's somber narration is a turnoff, but this plucky little diatribe gets you thinking about the larger implications facing future generations".&lt;ref name="New York Daily News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bernard|first1=Jami|title=THE FUTURE OF FOOD|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/movie-digest-article-1.626532|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]|date=14 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote the film "is a powerful, if one-sided, attack on the GM food industry," because the filmmaker "builds a strong case against GM food and its producers", but a "major weakness is that the GM producers are not given time to explain their side of the story."&lt;ref name="The Hollywood Reporter"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Havis|first1=Richard James|title=review 'The Future of Food'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001181873|accessdate=30 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105005723/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001181873|archivedate=5 January 2006|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=28 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Seattle Times]]'' noted that the film used "every propagandist trick in the book",&lt;ref name="Seattle Times"/&gt; supported by "foreboding background music",&lt;ref name="Seattle Times"/&gt; and a "relentlessly downbeat tone and gloom-and-doom hand-wringing over the way corporate greed is poisoning the globe"&lt;ref name="Seattle Times"/&gt; to force their point across, and wrote "Most of us have some awareness about the debate over genetically engineered food. But it’s a good bet that far fewer people know how insidious these possibly dangerous man-made organisms have become as their invasion into the world’s food supply grows".&lt;ref name="Seattle Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fry`Ted|title="The Future of Food": Documentary enforces gloom-and-doom message|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/the-future-of-food-documentary-enforces-gloom-and-doom-message/|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=[[Seattle Times]]|date=23 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Denver Post]]'' referred to the film as a "propaganda documentary",&lt;ref name="The Denver Post"/&gt; and commented that while the film's concept had great possibilities with hopes that it would "become a worthy champion of the little guy"&lt;ref name="The Denver Post"/&gt; in its covering of [[Percy Schmeiser]]'s battle with Monsanto, the film failed because "filmmaker Deborah Koons Garcia isn't much of a journalist"&lt;ref name="The Denver Post"/&gt; and she "strays from this fascinating case to a generalized attack on biotechnology and corporate farming",&lt;ref name="The Denver Post"/&gt; through using "loose accusations and emotionally dishonest footage to argue her cause".&lt;ref name="The Denver Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Booth|first1=Michael|title=Food for lazy thought|url=http://www.denverpost.com/movies/ci_3132389|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=[[The Denver Post]]|date=20 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thubten Jigme Norbu''' ({{bo|t=ཐུབ་བསྟན་འཇིགས་མེད་ནོར་བུ་|w=Thub-stan 'Jigs-med Nor-bu}}) (August 16, 1922 – September 5, 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/09/america/obits.php Thubten Norbu, eldest brother of Dalai Lama, dies], Douglas Martin, September 9, 2008 [[The New York Times International Edition]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/08/tibet Obituary:Thubten Jigme Norbu]&lt;/ref&gt;), recognised as the [[Taktser Rinpoche]], was a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] [[lama]], writer, [[civil and political rights|civil rights activist]] and professor of Tibetan studies and is the eldest brother of the [[14th Dalai Lama]], Tenzin Gyatso. He was one of the first high-profile Tibetans to go into exile and was the first Tibetan to [[Tibetan Americans|settle in the United States]].

==Early life==
Thubten Jigme Norbu was born in 1922 in the small, mountain village of [[Taktser]] in the [[Amdo County]] of Eastern [[Tibet]]. At the age of three, he was recognized by the [[13th Dalai Lama]] as the 24th incarnation of Taktser Rinpoche. At the age of eight, he was taken to [[Kumbum Monastery]] in [[Amdo]], the birthplace of [[Je Tsongkhapa]] who is the founder of the [[Gelug]] sect of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

Historically, [[Kumbum]] was also the frequent residence of previous Dalai Lamas and [[Panchen Lama]]s. At Kumbum, Norbu began his training as a monk. At the age of 27, he was selected to serve as the [[abbot]] of [[Kumbum Monastery]]. At this time, Kumbum was one of the largest monasteries in Eastern Tibet.

Kumbum, however was one of the first areas to be invaded by the army of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC). The PRC held Norbu under [[house arrest]] in the monastery, sleeping in his room and following him 24 hours a day. The PRC demanded that he travel to [[Lhasa]], denounce the Tibetan government, and denounce his younger brother the Dalai Lama, who was then about 15 years old. Norbu pretended to agree with the PRC's demands and, as a result, was able to reach Lhasa to warn his brother of the [[History of Tibet (1950–present)|seriousness of the Chinese invasion]].

==In exile 1950–2008==
[[File:IUB-Showalter Fountain.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rinpoche worked as a Professor of Tibetan studies at Indiana University]]
Norbu decided in 1950 that he would leave Tibet and attempt to [[protests and uprisings in Tibet since 1950|educate the world]] about the atrocities in Tibet and the actions of the PRC.

After leaving Tibet, Norbu worked continually for Tibet and the Tibetans in exile. He served as the Representative of the Dalai Lama and the [[Central Tibetan Administration]] to Japan and North America. He also served as Professor of Tibetan Studies at [[Indiana University Bloomington]]. He wrote a number of books, including, in 1959, his autobiography, ''Tibet Is My Country'' as told to [[Heinrich Harrer]] and in 1968 ''Tibet: Its History, Religion and People'', with [[Colin Turnbull]]. During the years, Norbu frequently lectured about the Tibetan situation at seminars throughout the world.

In 1979, Rinpoche founded the [[Tibetan Cultural Center]] (TCC) in Bloomington, a center devoted to preserving [[Tibetan culture]] and religion. In 1989, Colin Turnbull came and participated in the building of Tibetan Cultural Center with him. The facility, renamed the [[Tibetan-Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center]] (or TMBCC) in 2006, has a Cultural Building, housing Tibetan works of art such as a [[Bhaisajyaguru|Medicine Buddha]] [[sand mandala]], and Tibetan butter sculptures. The Cultural Building also has a library of Tibetan-related works and a gift shop where visitors may purchase articles made by Tibetan refugees in exile.

His brother the Dalai Lama has visited the TMBCC on five separate occasions. In 1987, he dedicated the [[Changchub Chorten]]; in 1996 the Dalai Lama consecrated the cornerstone of the [[Kumbum Chamtse Ling Temple]]; in 1999, he was at the Center for 12 days when he gave the [[Kalachakra]] Initiation for World Peace and Harmony for the [[Kalachakra stupa]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmbcc.org/our-past/ Founder of TMBCC]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2003, the Dalai Lama dedicated the Kumbum Chamtse Ling Temple in an interfaith ceremony; in 2007 he dedicated a new arch at the temple as well as holding a series of classes over six days.

==Independence walks==
[[File:Kalacakra stupa.jpg|left|thumb|262x262px|Stupa on the grounds of Tibetan Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center, Bloomington, Indiana. The [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] performed the initiation here in 1999, "to promote world peace."]]
In 1995, Norbu cofounded the [[International Tibet Independence Movement]] (ITIM). He has led three walks for Tibet's independence. In 1995, he led a week-long walk 80 miles from Bloomington, Indiana to [[Indianapolis]], Indiana. In 1996, this was followed by a 300-mile, 45-day walk from the PRC embassy in Washington, DC to the [[Headquarters of the United Nations]], surrounded by New York City. The following year, joined by [[Dadon]] with her 3 years old son, he led a 600-mile walk from [[Toronto]] to New York City, beginning on March 10 ([[Tibetan Uprising Day]]) and ending June 14 ([[Flag Day]]). In 1998, ITIM walked for independence starting in [[Portland, Oregon]] and ending in [[Vancouver]]. In 2000, one arm of ITIM walked from San Francisco and another from [[San Diego]]. The two branches met in Los Angeles to greet the Dalai Lama who was giving a teaching and empowerment at [[Thubten Dhargye Ling]].

==Life in the US==
[[File:Bloomington-TibetanCC-Stupa-9107.jpg|thumb|On the grounds of Tibetan Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center, Bloomington, Indiana]]
Norbu lived at the Tibetan-Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center with his wife Kunyang. They have three sons, Lhundrup, Kunga and Jigme Norbu, all born in New York. In late 2002, Norbu suffered a series of strokes and became an invalid. In 2005, the Dalai Lama appointed the  [[8th Arjia Rinpoche]], another former abbot of Kumbum Monastery, to take over the directorship of the Tibetan-Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center.  Norbu remained until his death part of the daily life of the TMBCC where he was acclaimed as the founder of the facility and the foremost proponent in the world for the recognition and preservation of the culture of Tibet.

Norbu died at the age of 86 on September 5, 2008 at his home in Indiana in the United States having been ill for several years. His body was [[cremation|cremated]] in a traditional Buddhist ceremony.&lt;ref name="cremation"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.idsnews.com/news/story.aspx?id=62690&amp;comview=1 |title=Dalai Lama's brother cremated Thursday |author=Elvia Malagon |publisher=''[[Indiana Daily Student]]'' |date=September 12, 2008 |accessdate=September 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His youngest son, Jigme, died at the age of 45 on February 14, 2011 while carrying on his father's work. He was hit by a car in Florida during a walk to promote Tibetan independence and raise awareness of Tibet.

The {{nihongo|'''Toa-kai'''|東亜会|Tōa-kai}} is a [[yakuza]] syndicate based in [[Tokyo]] with a predominantly [[Koreans in Japan|Korean Japanese]] membership. Originally named the {{nihongo|Tosei-kai|東声会|Tōsei-kai|"Voice of the East Gang"&lt;ref name="Kaplan_228"&gt;''Yakuza: Japan's criminal underworld'', p.228, 2003, [[David Kaplan (author)|David E. Kaplan]] and Alec Dubro, {{ISBN|0-520-21562-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}, with its historic leader [[Hisayuki Machii]], the Toa-kai was deeply involved in the history of [[Tokyo]]'s [[South Korea]]n community and Japan's [[anti-communist]] circles in the 20th century. It is the fifth largest Yakuza clan.

==History==
The group was formed by [[Hisayuki Machii]], a [[Zainichi Korean|Korean Japanese]] mob boss,&lt;ref name="facta"&gt;[http://facta.co.jp/article/200904059.html "Overview of a 'heretic' of post-war history"], April 2009, ''The Facta Magazine'' {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Tosei-kai in 1948.&lt;ref name="Kaplan_228"/&gt; The Tosei-kai was originally a reported [[far-right]] organization of [[anti-communist]] activism&lt;ref name="facta"/&gt; led by Machii as a sympathizer of [[Kanji Ishiwara]],&lt;ref name="sano"&gt;[http://www.shinchosha.co.jp/shinkan/nami/shoseki/313731.html "Review : The Man Called the Wild Bull : 'Tosei-kai' Hisayuki Machii's Post-war History"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927000814/http://www.shinchosha.co.jp/shinkan/nami/shoseki/313731.html |date=2011-09-27 }}, March 2009, Shin'ichi Sano, ''[[Shinchosha]]'' {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was in conflict with the [[North Korea]]-associated [[General Association of Korean Residents in Japan]].&lt;ref name="facta"/&gt;

The Tosei-kai quickly became one of [[Tokyo]]'s most powerful gangs,&lt;ref name="Kaplan_228"/&gt; and had significantly expanded during the [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|time of the post-war economic growth]]. Membership reached 1,500 in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="facta"/&gt; As the leader of the syndicate, Machii became an essential "fixer" between Japan and [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2043575_2043788_2043553,00.html "Hisayuki Machii - Top 10 Real-Life Mob Bosses"], 20 January 2011, ''[[TIME]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing police crackdowns by 1965 forced Machii to disband the Tosei-kai and establish a new gang, the {{nihongo|Toa Yuai Jigyo Kumiai|東亜友愛事業組合|Tōa Yūai Jigyō Kumiai}}, or "East Asia Friendship Enterprise Association". He also formed a "legitimate" company called the {{nihongo|Toa Sogo Kigyo|東亜相互企業|Tōa Sōgo Kigyō}}, or East Asia Enterprises Company, with the famous [[Yoshio Kodama]] as Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref name="Kaplan_229"&gt;''Yakuza: Japan's criminal underworld'', p.229, 2003, [[David Kaplan (author)|David E. Kaplan]] and Alec Dubro, {{ISBN|0-520-21562-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the Toa Yuai Jigyo Kumiai changed the name as {{nihongo|Toa Yuai|東亜友愛|Tōa Yūai}} and Toa-kai.

The founder Machii retired in the 1980s,&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; and died of heart failure on September 14, 2002 in Tokyo. Also known as a successful businessman, he was 79.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.47news.jp/CN/200209/CN2002092101000150.html "Mr. Hisayuki Machii passes away"], 21 September 2002, ''47 News, [[Kyodo]]'' {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condition==
The Toa-kai is a member of a [[bakuto]] fraternal federation named the Kanto Hatsuka-kai, along with four other [[Kantō region|Kanto]]-based yakuza syndicates, the [[Sumiyoshi-kai]], the [[Inagawa-kai]], the [[Matsuba-kai]], and the [[Soai-kai]].&lt;ref name="ino"&gt;[http://www.alles.or.jp/~inokenji/hyouron.html "The Yamaguchi-gumi Bakuhu theory"], Kenji Ino, 17 December 2007 {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Toa-kai has aligned itself with the largest known [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] syndicate since the syndicate's [[Kazuo Taoka|Taoka]] era in the 20th century,&lt;ref name="facta"/&gt; and has been closely supported by [[Shinobu Tsukasa]], the sixth-generation godfather of the Yamaguchi-gumi, since 2005 when the sixth era of the Yamaguchi-gumi officially started.&lt;ref name="ino"/&gt;
[[File:Ginza-Dori Avenue at night.JPG|thumb|right|The Toa-kai once took control of [[Ginza]], a large district in Tokyo.&lt;ref name="Kaplan_228"/&gt;]]

===Territories===
The Toa-kai has its headquarters in [[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]] ever since its formation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shinchosha.co.jp/books/html/313731.html "The Man Called the Wild Bull : 'Tosei-kai' Hisayuki Machii's Post-war History"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927000754/http://www.shinchosha.co.jp/books/html/313731.html |date=2011-09-27 }}, 18 February 2009, Yasunobu Shirouchi, {{ISBN|978-4-10-313731-3}} {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Toa-kai has its five branch organizations in Tokyo, and one branch organization outside of Tokyo.&lt;ref name="yw"&gt;[http://wikiyakuza.wiki.fc2.com/wiki/%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%9C%E4%BC%9A "Toa-kai"], ''Yakuza Wiki'' {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Okinawa====
The Toa-kai's notable branch organizations include the {{nihongo|Yoshimi-kogyo|誼興業}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.police.pref.okinawa.jp/anzennakurashi/hanzaihigai/boryokudan01.html "Boryokudan Expulsion Manual"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228124131/http://www.police.pref.okinawa.jp/anzennakurashi/hanzaihigai/boryokudan01.html |date=2011-12-28 }}, July 2011, ''[[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa Prefectural]] [[Japanese police|Police]]'' {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yoshimi-kogyo is the Toa-kai's only branch organization based outside of Tokyo.&lt;ref name="yw"/&gt; Based on the [[Okinawa]] island, the Yoshimi-kogyo is one of the three major yakuza groups in the Okinawa region, along with the [[Kyokuryu-kai]] and the [[Okinawa Kyokuryu-kai]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oki-boutsui.or.jp/detail.jsp?id=1003&amp;menuid=662&amp;funcid=1 "Boryokudan condition in the prefecture"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619071257/http://www.oki-boutsui.or.jp/detail.jsp?id=1003&amp;menuid=662&amp;funcid=1 |date=2012-06-19 }}, October 2007, ''Okinawa Prefectural Conference for the Expulsion of the Boryokudan'' {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the Yoshimi-kogyo reportedly traces back to the late 20th century, when Toshio Gibo, an [[Ryukyuans|ethnic Okinawan]] mobster, formed an anti-[[left wing|left]] nationalist organization named the Makoto-kai in Okinawa under influence of [[Yoshio Kodama]]. Gibo met with Machii through Kodama, founding an affiliate of the Tosei-kai in Okinawa.&lt;ref name="sano"/&gt;

Okinawa's underworld has been known for its exclusiveness since the 20th century, where the dominating [[Kyokuryu-kai]] has persistently attacked and violently expelled any yakuza syndicate attempting to enter the island. The reason why the Toa-kai has been able to be active on the island may be because the group has historically been more oriented to legitimate businesses, and of its gentle stance, in contrast to other yakuza syndicates which have attempted to expand their influences into Okinawa with heavy violence, such as the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] and especially the [[Dojin-kai]].

For example, in 2002 in Okinawa, only one Yoshimi member was arrested, while 56 Kyokuryu-kai members and 95 Okinawa Kyokuryu-kai members were arrested.[http://ryukyushimpo.jp/news/storyid-119248-storytopic-86.html]

|accessdate=2009-11-23
|publisher=InvestmentMine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The upward trend for the prices of [[uranium]] was already apparent since 2003. This prompted increases in mining activity. A possible direct cause for the bubble is the flooding of the [[Cigar Lake Mine]], [[Saskatchewan]], which has the largest undeveloped high-grade uranium ore deposits in the world. This created uncertainty about short-term future of the uranium supply.&lt;ref name="bottom"/&gt; Other factors are speculation triggered by growing expectations around [[Nuclear power in India|India]] and [[Nuclear power in the People's Republic of China|China]]'s nuclear programs, and a reduction in available [[Megatons to Megawatts Program|weapons-grade uranium]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfr.org/energy/global-uranium-supply-demand/p14705&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The impact of the bubble on [[nuclear power]] generation was small, as most power plants have long-term uranium delivery contracts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |url=http://www.cameco.com/uranium_101/markets/
  |title=Uranium 101: Markets
  |publisher=Cameco
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the price of natural uranium makes up only a small fraction of their operating cost. However, the sharp fall in prices after mid-2007 caused a lot of new companies focused on exploration and mining to lose their viability and go out of business.&lt;ref name="bottom"/&gt; Due to increased prospecting, known and inferred reserves of uranium have increased by 15% between 2005 and 2007.&lt;ref name="wnachart"&gt;{{Cite news

'''Water resources law''' (in some jurisdictions, shortened to "water law") is the field of law dealing with the ownership, control, and use of [[water]] as a resource. It is most closely related to [[property law]], and is older than and distinct from [[Water quality law|laws governing water quality]].

== Waters subject to regulation ==

Water is ubiquitous and does not respect political boundaries. Water resources laws may apply to any portion of the [[hydrosphere]] over which claims may be made to appropriate or maintain the water to serve some purpose. Such waters include, but are not limited to:

*[[Surface water]]s - lakes, rivers, streams, oceans, and wetlands;
*[[Surface runoff]]—generally water that flows across the land from [[rain]], [[floodwater]]s, and [[snowmelt]] before those waters reach watercourses, lakes, wetlands, or oceans;
*[[Groundwater]], particularly water present in [[aquifer]]s.

==History==
The history of people's relation to water illustrates varied approaches to the management of water resources.  "Lipit Ishtar and Ur Nammu both contain water provisions, pre-date Hammurabi by at least 250 years, and clearly provide the normative underpinnings on which the Hammurabi Code was constructed."{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} The [[Code of Hammurabi]] was one of the earliest written laws to deal with water issues, and this Code included the administration of water use. The Code was developed about 3,800 years ago by King Hammurabi of Babylonia.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, P. Andrew, and Cech, Tom. ''Colorado Water Law for Non-Lawyers''. Boulder, CO, USA: University Press of Colorado, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difficulties of water rights==
Water has unique features that make it difficult to regulate using laws designed mainly for land. Water is mobile, its supply varies by year and season as well as location, and it can be used simultaneously by many users. As with property (land) law, water rights can be described as a "bundle of sticks" containing multiple, separable activities that can have varying levels of regulation. For instance, some uses of water divert it from its natural course but return most or all of it (e.g. [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric plants]]), while others consume much of what they take (ice, [[agriculture]]), and still others use water without diverting it at all (e.g. [[boating]]). Each type of activity has its own needs and can in theory be regulated separately. There are several types of conflict likely to arise: absolute shortages; shortages in a particular time or place; diversions of water that reduce the flow available to others; pollutants or other changes (such as temperature or [[turbidity]]) that render water unfit for others' use; and the need to maintain "in-stream flows" of water to protect the natural [[ecosystem]].

One theory of history, put forward in the influential book ''Oriental Despotism'', holds that many empires were organized around a central authority that controlled a population through monopolizing the water supply. Such a [[hydraulic empire]] creates the potential for [[despotism]], and serves as a cautionary tale for designing water regulations.

Water law involves controversy in some parts of the world where a growing population faces increasing competition over a limited natural supply. Disputes over [[rivers]], [[lake]]s and underground [[aquifers]] cross national borders.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Olivia N., "Binational Water Management: Perspectives of Local Texas Officials in the U.S.-Mexico Border Region" (2009). Applied Research Projects. Paper 313. http://ecommons.txstate.edu/arp/313&lt;/ref&gt; Although water law is still regulated mainly by individual countries, there are international sets of proposed rules such as the [http://www.internationalwaterlaw.org/IntlDocs/Helsinki_Rules.htm Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers] and the [http://www.africanwater.org/hague_declaration.htm Hague Declaration on Water Security in the 21st Century].

Long-term issues in water law include the possible [[effects of global warming]] on rainfall patterns and evaporation; the availability and cost of [[desalination]] technology; the control of [[pollution]], and the growth of [[aquaculture]].

== Legal models ==
The legal right to use a designated water supply is known as a [[water right]]. There are two major models used for water rights. The first is [[riparian rights]], where the owner of the adjacent land has the right to the water in the stream. The other major model is the [[Prior-appropriation water rights | prior appropriations model]], the first party to make use of a water supply has the first rights to it, regardless of whether the property is near the water source. Riparian systems are generally more common in areas where water is plentiful, while appropriations systems are more common in dry climates. As water resource law is complex, many areas have some combination of the two approaches.

==Water law by country==

=== International law ===
{{Main article|Right to water}}

The right to water to satisfy basic human needs for personal and domestic uses has been protected under international [[human rights law]]. When incorporated in national legal frameworks, this right is articulated to other water rights within the broader body of water law. The human right to water has been recognized in international law through a wide range of international documents, including international human rights treaties, declarations and other standards.

The human right to water places the main responsibilities upon governments to ensure that people can enjoy "sufficient, safe, accessible and affordable water, without discrimination". Most especially, governments are expected to take reasonable steps to avoid a [[contaminated water|contaminated water supply]] and to ensure there are no water access distinctions amongst citizens. Today all States have at least ratified one human rights convention which explicitly or implicitly recognizes the right, and they all have signed at least one political declaration recognizing this right.

===Canada===
Under the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', jurisdiction over waterways is divided between the federal and provincial governments. Federal jurisdiction is derived from the powers to regulate navigation and shipping, fisheries, and the governing of the northern territories, which has resulted in the passage of:

:* the ''[[Fisheries Act (Canada)|Fisheries Act]]'',
:* the ''[[Navigation Protection Act]]'',
:* the ''[[Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act]]'', and
:* the ''[[Oceans Act (Canada)|Oceans Act]]''.

Provincial jurisdiction is derived from the powers over [[property and civil rights]], matters of a local and private nature, and management of [[Crown land]]s. In [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]] and other provinces, the [[stream bed|bed]]s of all [[navigable waters]] are vested in the Crown, in contrast to [[English law]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''{{sourcetext|source = The Beds of Navigable Waters Act}}'' in Ontario and [http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=/CCQ/CCQ_A.html Civil Code of Quebec], s. 919, in Quebec&lt;/ref&gt; All provincial governments also govern [[water quality]] through laws on [[environmental protection]] and [[drinking water]], such as the ''[[Clean Water Act (Ontario)|Clean Water Act]]'' in Ontario.

===Australia===
Water law in Australia varies with each state.

====Tasmania====
A newly formed Tasmanian Water Corporation has compulsorily acquired all drinking water supply infrastructure without payment and does not have direct accountability &lt;ref&gt;Flora Fox Regional News, Kingborough, Hobart Southern Tasmania  http://florafox.tumblr.com/post/3418412236/water-sewer-governance-tasmania&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water law in the United States===
{{Main article|Water law in the United States}}

In the [[United States]] there are complex legal systems for allocating [[water right]]s that vary by region. These varying systems exist for both historical and geographic reasons. Water law encompasses a broad array of subjects or categories designed to provide a framework to resolve disputes and policy issues relating to water:

*Public waters, including tidal waters and navigable waterways.
*Other surface waters—generally water that flows across non-public land from rain, floodwaters, and snowmelt before those waters reach public watercourses.
*Groundwater, sometimes called subterranean, percolating, or underground water
*Public regulation of waters, including flood control, environmental regulation—state and federal, public health regulation and regulation of fisheries
*Related to all of the above is interplay of public and private rights in water, which draws on aspects of eminent domain law and the federal commerce clause powers
*Water project law:  the highly developed law regarding the formation, operation, and finance of public and quasi-public entities which operate local public works of flood control, navigation control, irrigation, and avoidance of environmental degradation
*Treaty Rights of Native Americans

The law governing these topics comes from all layers of law.  Some derives from common law principles which have developed over centuries, and which evolve as the nature of disputes presented to courts change.  For example, the judicial approach to landowner rights to divert surface waters has changed significantly in the last century as public attitudes about land and water have evolved.   Some derives from state statutory law.  Some derives from the original public grants of land to the States and from the documents of their origination. Some derives from state, federal and local regulation of waters through zoning, public health and other regulation.  Non-federally recognized Indian tribes do not have water rights.

===Water law in the European Union===
For countries within the [[European Union]], water-related [[European Union directive|directives]] are important for [[water resource]] management and environmental and [[water quality]] standards. Key directives include the [[Urban Waste Water Directive]] 1992 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-urbanwaste/index_en.html|title=Water pollution - Environment - European Commission|author=|date=|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (requiring most towns and cities to treat their wastewater to specified standards), and the [[Water Framework Directive]] 2000/60/EC, which requires water resource plans based on [[river basin]]s, including [[public participation]] based on [[Aarhus Convention]] principles. See [http://www.watertime.net/Docs/WP1/D7_Int_Context_final-revb.pdf Watertime — the international context], Section 2.

The '''Worshipful Company of Ironmongers''' is one of the [[Livery Company|livery companies]] of the [[City of London]], incorporated under a [[Royal Charter]] in 1463.

==History==
[[File:Samuel Scott - Westminster from Lambeth, with the Ceremonial Barge of the Ironmongers' Company - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Ceremonial Barge of the Ironmongers' Company]]

The Ironmongers, who were originally known as the Ferroners, were incorporated under a [[Royal Charter]] in 1463.  The Company's original association with iron merchants, however, has lessened, especially due to the movement of the industry from Southern England to the North, where iron ore has been more readily available.  The Company today is primarily a charitable institution.

The Company ranks tenth in the [[order of precedence]] of the City of London's livery companies; it is therefore one of the "Great Twelve City Livery Companies".  The Company's motto is ''God Is Our Strength''.

==Ironmongers' Hall==
[[File:Entrance to Ironmongers' Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1209695.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Entrance to Ironmongers' Hall]]
'''Ironmongers' Hall''' is the home of the Worshipful Company of Ironmongers. It is located in [[Aldersgate|Aldersgate Street]] in the [[City of London]]. The first hall, dating back to 1457, was in Fenchurch Street; it was rebuilt in 1587 and rebuilt again in 1745 on the same site.&lt;ref name=company&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ironmongers.org/company_history.htm|title=The Ironmongers' Company|publisher=The Ironmongers' Company|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third hall was destroyed on 7 July 1917 by a bomb dropped during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=company/&gt; The present Hall stands on land which was bought in 1922: construction work, which was undertaken by [[Holland, Hannen &amp; Cubitts]],&lt;ref&gt;Cubitts 1810 - 1975, published 1975&lt;/ref&gt; started that year and the Hall was opened on 17 June 1925.&lt;ref name=company/&gt;
