The '''A329''' is an east-west road in [[Southern England]] that runs from [[Wentworth, Surrey|Wentworth]] in [[Surrey]] to  [[Thame]] in [[Oxfordshire]]. The A329 starts at the [[A30 road|A30]] in Surrey and passes through [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]], [[Bracknell]], [[Wokingham]], [[Earley]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Purley on Thames|Purley]], [[Pangbourne]], [[Lower Basildon]], [[Streatley, Berkshire|Streatley]], [[Moulsford]] and [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]]. It connects to junction 7 of the [[M40 motorway|M40]] before finally ending at a junction with the [[A418 road|A418]] at Thame.

The A329 originally (in 1922) terminated at Reading.  In the 1930s it was extended to [[Shillingford]] on part of the route of the former [[A42 road (England)|A42]].  After the M40 motorway was opened in the 1970s it was extended to Thame on the former route of the B4013.  In 1993, when the new [[Winterbrook Bridge]] enabled traffic to by-pass Wallingford, the section between Wallingford and Shillingford was downgraded to become an unclassified road.

Most of the road is single carriageway, apart from the section through Bracknell, and in central Reading. In Reading the road is dualled where it forms the [[Inner Distribution Road]]. In Bracknell the A329 originally ran along the High Street (now pedestrianised) and continued west along the Wokingham Road (now B3408). Today the original London Road is dualled for a short section approaching the Met Office Roundabout. The dual carriageway then by-passes north of the pedestrianised town centre to the Giroscope Roundabout, where it crosses the former route, heading south west to the Twin Bridges roundabout and along the dual Berkshire Way to meet the old route at Amen Corner. Here the A329 continues into Wokingham on the original route, while the [[A329(M) motorway|A329(M)]] by-passes to the north.

'''Alexander Rose''' (1781 &amp;ndash; 1860) of [[Edinburgh]] was a [[wood]] and [[ivory]] [[turning|turner]], following in the footsteps of his father, John, who came from [[Cromarty]]. He developed an interest in [[minerals]] and began a mineral collection, becoming a dealer in minerals. He later became a lecturer in [[geology]] and [[mineralogy]] at [[Queen's College, Edinburgh]] and was eventually nominated as a Fellow of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]].

He was educated at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]] and in 1816, he married Isabella Boyne. They had three sons and six daughters.

In 1834, eleven of his students set up the [[Edinburgh Geological Society]], of which Rose became President for eleven years until 1846.

He retired from active work in 1856 and died four years later.

Recently, he has come to fame again as the notorious 'Alex the Geologist' in the math problem books written by [[Phillips Exeter Academy]].  The series of problems, featured throughout all the math levels, has Alex located in the desert, a certain distance from a road and a certain distance from his camp.  Generally, the goal is to calculate the fastest route back to his camp.

The '''American Solar Challenge''' (ASC), previously known as the '''North American Solar Challenge''' and '''Sunrayce''', is a [[Solar car racing|solar car race]] across the United States. In the race, teams from colleges and universities throughout North America design, build, test, and race [[solar vehicle|solar-powered vehicles]] in a long distance [[road rally]]-style event. ASC is a test of teamwork, engineering skill, and endurance that stretches across thousands of miles of public roads.

ASC 2016 took place from July 30 – August 6, on a 1,975 mile (3,178&amp;nbsp;km) route from [[Brecksville, Ohio|Brecksville]], [[Ohio]] to [[Hot Springs, South Dakota|Hot Springs]], [[South Dakota]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://americansolarchallenge.org/the-competition/ascfsgp-2016/ ASC/FSGP 2016 page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format and organization ==
[[Image:North American Solar Challenge 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Solar race cars and crews at the start of the 2005 race in Austin, Texas. ''Photo: Stefano Paltera/North American Solar Challenge.'']]

===Rules===
*Race consists of a series of timed stages between predetermined locations; all teams begin and end each stage in the same location
*The team with the lowest overall elapsed time wins
*The total area of all solar cells and related reflectors, etc. must not exceed 6&amp;nbsp;square meters
*When the vehicle has stopped, the solar array may be reoriented toward the sun for charging batteries
*Strict specifications and engineering scrutiny process is provided for vehicle configuration, safety requirements, and other standards
*Previous races have divided teams into '''open''' and '''stock''' classes based on levels of solar cell and battery technologies.
*The [[Formula Sun Grand Prix]] track race serves as a qualifier for the more prestigious ASC.

==History==
Originally called ''Sunrayce USA'', the first race was organized and sponsored by [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in 1990 in an effort to promote automotive engineering and solar energy among college students. At the time, GM had just won the inaugural [[World Solar Challenge]] in Australia in 1987; rather than continue actively racing, it instead opted to sponsor collegiate events.

Subsequent races were held in 1993, 1995, 1997 and 1999 under the name ''Sunrayce [year]'' (e.g. [http://www.rose-hulman.edu/SolarPhantom/sunrayce93.html Sunrayce 93]). In 2001, the race was renamed [http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/deployment.html ''American Solar Challenge''] and was sponsored by the [[United States Department of Energy]] and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]]. Beginning in 2005, its name changed again to ''North American Solar Challenge'', in order to reflect the border crossing into Canada and the addition of co-sponsor [[Natural Resources Canada]]. The name was changed back to ASC in 2010.

After the 2005 race, the U.S. Department of Energy discontinued its sponsorship, resulting in no scheduled race for 2007. Sponsorship was taken over for NASC 2008 by [[Toyota]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toyota.com/about/news/community/2008/07/30-2-solarchallenge.html Toyota Sponsors World's Longest Solar Car Race] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927150915/http://www.toyota.com/about/news/community/2008/07/30-2-solarchallenge.html |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''American Solar Challenge''' is now governed by the [http://americansolarchallenge.org/about/innovators-educational-foundation/ ''Innovators Educational Foundation''].

[[Sunrayce 97|Overall Standings]]

===1999===
'''Sunrayce 99''', running from Washington, D.C., to Orlando, Florida, was notable for its lack of sunshine. The [[Missouri University of Science and Technology|University of Missouri-Rolla]]'s ''Solar Miner II'' won the race with an average speed of {{convert|25.3|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dnr.louisiana.gov/index.cfm?md=pagebuilder&amp;tmp=home&amp;pid=479 Louisiana DNR article]&lt;/ref&gt; The car from [[Queen's University]] placed second.

[[Sunrayce 99|Overall Standings]]

===2001===
In 2001, the race changed its name to the '''American Solar Challenge''' and followed a new route from Chicago, [[Illinois]] to [[Claremont, California]] along much of the old [[U.S. Route 66]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette9.com/racing66/american.htm Gazette9 article]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Michigan]] won the overall race and the Open Class with a total elapsed time of 56&amp;nbsp;hours, 10&amp;nbsp;minutes, and 46 seconds, followed by the [[Missouri University of Science and Technology|University of Missouri-Rolla]]. The [[University of Arizona]] team won the Stock Class event.

===2005===
The 2005 race, renamed the '''North American Solar Challenge''', was both the longest and most hotly contested race in the history of the event. The route covered {{convert|2494.9|mi|km|abbr=on}}, taking the teams from [[Austin, Texas]] in the United States to [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] in Canada. The race was won by the ''Momentum'' from the [[University of Michigan Solar Car Team|University of Michigan]] with an average speed of {{convert|46.2|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The [[University of Minnesota Solar Vehicle Project|University of Minnesota]]'s ''Borealis III'' followed in second place less than 12 minutes behind, with an average speed of {{convert|46.0|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travis.typepad.com/umnsvpracing/ Minnesota blog]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://solarcarold.engin.umich.edu/pastteams/momentum/blog/index.html Michigan blog] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910093956/http://solarcarold.engin.umich.edu/pastteams/momentum/blog/index.html |date=2015-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead teams often drove {{convert|65|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} (the maximum allowed), but were slowed by rain in [[Kansas]] and {{convert|20|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} headwinds in Canada. [[Stanford solar car project|Stanford University]]'s ''Solstice'' won the Stock Class, followed in second place by the ''Beam Machine'' from The [[University of California, Berkeley]].

[[North American Solar Challenge 2005|Overall Standings]]

[[Image:Continuum 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Michigan's Continuum wins NASC 2008.]]

===2008===
The 2008 '''North American Solar Challenge''' took place on July 13–22, 2008, mostly along the 2005 route from [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] to [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]]. The University of Michigan's ''[http://www.umsolar.com Continuum]'' won the race with a total elapsed time of 51&amp;nbsp;hours, 41&amp;nbsp;minutes, and 53 seconds, marking that school's fifth victory. ''Ra 7'' from [[Principia College]] followed in second place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2008/jul/solar3.shtml Iowa St. article]&lt;/ref&gt;

As many of the top cars were bumping up against the {{convert|65|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} race speed limit in the 2005 event, race rules were changed for 2008 order to improve safety and limit performance. Open class cars are now only allowed 6&amp;nbsp;square meters of active cell area, and upright seating is required for both open and stock class cars. The changes were carried over from the 2007 [[World Solar Challenge]].

[[North American Solar Challenge 2008|Overall Standings]]

===2010===
The 2010 race, renamed the '''American Solar Challenge''', ran June 20–26, 2010. The University of Michigan finished in first place, followed by the [[University of Minnesota Solar Vehicle Project|University of Minnesota]]'s ''Centaurus II'' in 2nd place and team Bochum from Germany in 3rd. The race route was entirely within the United States for the first time since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americansolarchallenge.org/the-competition/ascfsgp-2010/ ASC/FSGP 2010 page]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012===
Only four teams finished the 2012 '''American Solar Challenge''', a 1600-mile race from Rochester, NY to St. Paul, MN, under solar power alone. The University of Michigan's ''Quantum'' won the overall competition, over 10 hours ahead of the 2nd place team. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place teams were only an hour apart from each other. In order: [[Iowa State University]]'s ''Hyperion'', [[Principia College]]'s ''Ra7s'', and the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s ''Impulse''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americansolarchallenge.org/the-competition/ascfsgp-2012/ ASC/FSGP 2012 page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[electromagnetics]], especially in [[optics]], '''beam divergence''' is an angular measure of the increase in [[beam diameter]] or [[radius]] with distance from the [[Aperture|optical aperture]] or [[antenna aperture]] from which the beam emerges. The term is relevant only in the "[[far field]]", away from any [[focus (optics)|focus]] of the beam. Practically speaking, however, the far field can commence physically close to the radiating aperture, depending on aperture diameter and the operating wavelength.

Beam divergence is often used to characterize electromagnetic beams in the optical regime, for cases in which the aperture from which the beam emerges is very large with respect to the [[wavelength]]. However, it is also used in the [[radio frequency]] (RF) [[EM band|band]] for cases in which the antenna is very large relative to a wavelength.

Beam divergence usually refers to a beam of circular cross section, but not necessarily so. A beam may, for example, have an elliptical cross section, in which case the orientation of the beam divergence must be specified, for example with respect to the major or minor axis of the elliptical cross section.

The divergence of a beam can be calculated if one knows the beam diameter at two separate points far from any focus (''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''D&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''), and the distance (''l'') between these points. The beam divergence, &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;, is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\Theta=2 \arctan\left(\frac{D_f-D_i}{2 l}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

If a [[collimated beam]] is focused with a [[lens (optics)|lens]], the diameter &lt;math&gt;D_m&lt;/math&gt; of the beam in the rear focal plane of the lens is related to the divergence of the initial beam by 
:&lt;math&gt;\Theta=\frac{D_m}{f},\,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''f'' is the focal length of the lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uslasercorp.com/envoy/diverge.html |title=Measuring laser beam divergence |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that this measurement is valid only when the beam size is measured at the rear focal plane of the lens, i.e. where the focus would lie for a truly collimated beam, and not at the actual focus of the beam, which would occur behind the rear focal plane for a divergent beam.

Like all electromagnetic beams, [[laser]]s are subject to divergence, which is measured in [[milliradian]]s (mrad) or [[degree (angle)|degree]]s. For many applications, a lower-divergence beam is preferable. Neglecting divergence due to poor beam quality, the divergence of a laser beam is proportional to its wavelength and inversely proportional to the diameter of the beam at its narrowest point. For example, an ultraviolet laser that emits at a wavelength of 308&amp;nbsp;nm will have a lower divergence than an infrared laser at 808&amp;nbsp;nm, if both have the same minimum beam diameter. The divergence of good-quality laser beams is modeled using the mathematics of [[Gaussian beam]]s.

Gaussian laser beams are said to be [[diffraction limited]] when their radial beam divergence &lt;math&gt;\theta=\Theta/2&lt;/math&gt; is close to the minimum possible value, which is given by&lt;ref name= TLO&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=F. J. Duarte |first=Francisco J. |last=Duarte |title=Tunable Laser Optics |edition=2nd |publisher=CRC |location=New York |date=2015 |chapter=Chapter 3 |isbn=9781482245295 |url=http://www.tunablelaseroptics.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt; \theta = {\lambda \over\pi w},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the laser wavelength and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the beam at its narrowest point, which is called the "beam waist".  This type of beam divergence is observed from optimized laser cavities.  Information on the diffraction-limited divergence of a coherent beam is inherently given by the [[N-slit interferometric equation]].&lt;ref name=TLO /&gt;

'''Cavallo's multiplier''' was an early [[electrostatic machine|electrostatic influence machine]], invented in 1795 by the Anglo-Italian [[natural philosophy|natural philosopher]] [[Tiberius Cavallo]].&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; Its purpose was to multiply, or amplify, a small [[electric charge]] to a level where it was detectable by the insensitive [[electroscope]]s of the day. Repeated operation of the device could produce voltages high enough to generate sparks.

==Description==
Cavallo described his machine in his 1795 ''Treatise on Electricity''.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; He had examined [[Abraham Bennet|Bennet]]'s charge doubler of 1787 and found it wanting in several regards, notably in its inconsistent operation and tendency to retain the charge from an earlier experiment.&lt;ref name="Cavallo"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cavallo|first=Tiberius|title=A complete treatise on electricity, in theory and practice|date=1795|edition=4th|volume= Vol 3|pages=76&amp;ndash;81|url=https://archive.org/download/completetreatise03cavauoft/completetreatise03cavauoft.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavallo resolved to build a better device. His machine consisted of four metal plates supported on a wooden board by posts, of which three were [[electrical insulation|insulating]] and one [[electrical conduction|conducting]].&lt;ref name="Cavallo"/&gt;

The charge to be multiplied was applied to the first of these (plate ''A''), which stood on an insulating post. A moveable insulated metal plate (''B'') was brought close to ''A'' (though not permitted to touch it), and then [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]]. The charge on ''A'' caused charge separation on ''B'' due to [[electrostatic induction]]. Plate ''B'' was then moved away, breaking its earth connection. Since ''B'' was insulated, it acquired and retained a small charge opposite in sign to the charge on ''A''.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; Plate ''B'' was transferred by means of an insulating rod to be brought into electrical contact with the third metal plate ''C'' which was insulated. Since both ''B'' and ''C'' were [[electrical conductor|conducting]], ''B'' would transfer a portion of its charge to ''C''. To maximise the transferred charge, ''C'' was placed in close proximity to a final metal plate ''D'', which was earthed.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt;&lt;ref name=Queiroz_1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.ufrj.br/~acmq/electrostatic.html|title=Electrostatic Machines|last=de Queiroz|first=A. C. M. |publisher=Federal University of Rio de Janeiro|accessdate=2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experimenter would move Plate ''B'' repeatedly back and forth, placing it near to ''A'' and earthed at one end of its motion, and then into contact with ''C'' at the other. With each cycle, charge was drawn from the Earth and added to ''C''. After a suitable number of cycles, the grounded plate ''D'' would be removed, and the [[electrostatic potential]] on ''C'' would rise to approximately the potential of ''A'' multiplied by the number of operations.&lt;ref name=Queiroz_1/&gt;

Cavallo termed his device a multiplier, though 'addition' was perhaps a more accurate description of its operation, as the charge on ''C'' was accumulated by successive additions.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt;

== Wilson's machine ==
Wilson's machine, described by its inventor in ''[[Nicholson's Journal]]'' in August 1804,&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=W|title=Compound Electrical Instrument|journal=Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry &amp; the Arts|volume=IX|pages=pp.&amp;nbsp;19&amp;ndash;24|date=10 August 1804|url=https://archive.org/download/journalofnatural09lond/journalofnatural09lond_bw.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a development on this concept which simultaneously operated two Cavallo's multipliers by means of a pair of [[Reciprocating motion|reciprocating]] levers.&lt;ref name=Queiroz_2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.ufrj.br/~acmq/wilson.html|title=Wilson's machine|last=de Queiroz|first=A. C. M.|publisher=Federal University of Rio de Janeiro|accessdate=2008-10-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219080427/http://www.coe.ufrj.br/~acmq/wilson.html|archivedate=2009-12-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One side would accumulate the charge of the other, and since the two accumulating plates were connected together by means of a wire, Wilson's machine was a true multiplier, rather than an addition machine.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; The charge would thus accumulate more rapidly than Cavallo's multiplier and the machine could generate high voltages in a short period of time. It moreover was [[self-excitation|self-exciting]],&lt;ref name=Queiroz_2/&gt; needing no initial charge to operate, as the small initial charge acquired from [[contact electrification]] was enough to start the accumulation process.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="944">In [[acoustics]], '''dynamic aperture''' is analogous to [[aperture]] in photography. The arrays in [[side-scan sonar]] can be programmed to transmit just a few elements at a time or all the elements at once. The more elements transmitting, the narrower the beam and the better the [[Audio bit depth|resolution]].

The ratio of the [[imaging depth]] to the aperture size is known as the [[F-number]].  Dynamic aperture is keeping this number constant by growing the aperture with the imaging depth until the physical aperture cannot be increased. A modern medical ultrasound machine has a typical F-number of&amp;nbsp;0.5.

Side Scan Sonar systems produce images by forming angular “beams”. Beam width is determined by length of the sonar array, narrower beams resolve finer detail. Longer arrays with narrower beams provide finer spatial resolution. &lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:beam.jpg]] --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1730">The '''European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion''', briefly '''ESPON''', is a European funded programme under the objective of "European Territorial Cooperation" of the Cohesion Policy of the European Union. It is co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund - [[Interreg]]. 

The mission of the programme is to support policy development in relation to the aim of territorial cohesion and a harmonious development of the [[Europe]]an territory. Firstly it provides comparable information, evidence, analyses and scenarios on territorial dynamics and secondly it reveals territorial capital and potentials for the development of regions and larger territories thus contributing to European competitiveness, territorial cooperation and a sustainable and balanced development.

The current ESPON 2020 Programme is carried through by 28 [[European Union]] Member States as well as [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Norway]] and [[Switzerland]] and the [[European Commission]].

'''Extrasensory perception''' or '''ESP''', also called '''sixth sense''' or '''[[second sight]]''', includes claimed reception of information not gained through the recognized physical [[sense]]s, but sensed with the mind. The term was adopted by Duke University psychologist [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]] to denote [[psychic]] abilities such as [[intuition]], [[telepathy]], [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]], [[Clairvoyance#Clairaudience (hearing/listening)|clairaudience]], and [[clairvoyance]], and their trans-temporal operation as [[precognition]] or [[retrocognition]].&lt;ref name="SheehyChapman2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Noel Sheehy|author2=Antony J.

[[Parapsychology]] is the study of paranormal psychic phenomena, including ESP. Parapsychology has been criticized for continuing investigation despite being unable to provide convincing evidence for the existence of any psychic phenomena after more than a century of research.&lt;ref name="Cordón"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Cordón, Luis A. |title=Popular psychology: an encyclopedia |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] |location=Westport, Conn |year=2005 |page= 182|isbn=0-313-32457-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |quote=The essential problem is that a large portion of the scientific community, .including most research psychologists, regards parapsychology as a pseudoscience, due largely to its failure to move beyond null results in the way science usually does.

Within parapsychology, however, more than a century of experimentation has failed even to conclusively demonstrate the mere existence of paranormal phenomenon, yet parapsychologists continue to pursue that elusive goal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[scientific community]] rejects ESP due to the absence of an evidence base, the lack of a theory which would explain ESP and the lack of positive experimental results; it considers ESP to be [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Diaconis, Persi.

[[File:Cartas Zener.svg|thumb|[[Zener cards]] were first used in the 1930s for experimental research into ESP.]]
[[File:Hubert Pearce with J. B. Rhine.png|thumb|[[Hubert Pearce]] with [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]].]]

In the 1930s, at [[Duke University]] in North Carolina, [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]] and his wife [[Louisa E. Rhine]] conducted investigation into extrasensory perception. While Louisa Rhine concentrated on collecting accounts of spontaneous cases, J. B. Rhine worked largely in the laboratory, carefully defining terms such as ESP and ''psi'' and designing experiments to test them. A simple set of cards was developed, originally called [[Zener card]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – now called ESP cards. They bear the symbols circle, square, wavy lines, cross, and star; there are five cards of each in a pack of 25.

In a telepathy experiment, the "sender" looks at a series of cards while the "receiver" guesses the symbols. To try to observe clairvoyance, the pack of cards is hidden from everyone while the receiver guesses. To try to observe precognition, the order of the cards is determined after the guesses are made. Later he used dice to test for [[psychokinesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Sladek, John. (1974). ''The New Apocrypha: A Guide to Strange Sciences and Occult Beliefs''. Panther. pp. 172–174. {{ISBN|0-87281-712-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansel, C. E. M. (1980). ''ESP and Parapsychology: A Critical Re-evaluation''. Prometheus Books. pp. 86–122. {{ISBN|978-0879751203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parapsychology experiments at Duke evoked criticism from academics and others who challenged the concepts and evidence of ESP. A number of psychological departments attempted to repeat Rhine's experiments with failure. W. S. Cox (1936) from [[Princeton University]] with 132 subjects produced 25,064 trials in a playing card ESP experiment. Cox concluded "There is no evidence of extrasensory perception either in the 'average man' or of the group investigated or in any particular individual of that group. The discrepancy between these results and those obtained by Rhine is due either to uncontrollable factors in experimental procedure or to the difference in the subjects."&lt;ref&gt;Cox, W. S. (1936). ''An experiment in ESP''. Journal of Experimental Psychology 12: 437.&lt;/ref&gt; Four other psychological departments failed to replicate Rhine's results.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[C. E. M. Hansel]] ''The Search for a Demonstration of ESP'' in [[Paul Kurtz]]. (1985). ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. pp. 105–127. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}}

In 1938, the psychologist [[Joseph Jastrow]] wrote that much of the evidence for extrasensory perception collected by Rhine and other parapsychologists was anecdotal, biased, dubious and the result of "faulty observation and familiar human frailties".&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jastrow]]. (1938). ''ESP, House of Cards''. The American Scholar 8: 13–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Rhine's experiments were discredited due to the discovery that [[sensory leakage]] or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being able to read the symbols from the back of the cards and being able to see and hear the experimenter to note subtle clues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Gulliksen]]. (1938). ''Extra-Sensory Perception: What Is It?''. American Journal of Sociology. Vol. 43, No. 4. pp. 623–634. "Investigating Rhine's methods, we find that his mathematical methods are wrong and that the effect of this error would in some cases be negligible and in others very marked. We find that many of his experiments were set up in a manner which would tend to increase, instead of to diminish, the possibility of systematic clerical errors; and lastly, that the ESP cards can be read from the back."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wynn, Charles M; Wiggins, Arthur W. (2001). ''Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends...and Pseudoscience Begins''. Joseph Henry Press. p. 156. {{ISBN|978-0-309-07309-7}} "In 1940, Rhine coauthored a book, ''Extrasensory Perception After Sixty Years'' in which he suggested that something more than mere guess work was involved in his experiments. He was right! It is now known that the experiments conducted in his laboratory contained serious methodological flaws. Tests often took place with minimal or no screening between the subject and the person administering the test. Subjects could see the backs of cards that were later discovered to be so cheaply printed that a faint outline of the symbol could be seen. Furthermore, in face-to-face tests, subjects could see card faces reflected in the tester’s eyeglasses or cornea. They were even able to (consciously or unconsciously) pick up clues from the tester’s facial expression and voice inflection. In addition, an observant subject could identify the cards by certain irregularities like warped edges, spots on the backs, or design imperfections."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines|Hines, Terence]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 122. {{ISBN|1-57392-979-4}} "The procedural errors in the Rhine experiments have been extremely damaging to his claims to have demonstrated the existence of ESP. Equally damaging has been the fact that the results have not replicated when the experiments have been conducted in other laboratories."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jonathan C. (2009). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sJgONrua8IkC&amp;pg=PT226&amp;dq=rhine+pseudoscience&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MI2fUr7qIMqrhQelt4HgAg&amp;ved=0CDcQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rhine%20pseudoscience&amp;f=false ''Pseudoscience and Extraordinary Claims of the Paranormal: A Critical Thinker's Toolkit'']. Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-1405181228}}. "Today, researchers discount the first decade of Rhine's work with Zener cards. Stimulus leakage or cheating could account for all his findings. Slight indentations on the backs of cards revealed the symbols embossed on card faces. Subjects could see and hear the experimenter, and note subtle but revealing facial expressions or changes in breathing."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s parapsychologists became increasingly interested in the cognitive components of ESP, the subjective experience involved in making ESP responses, and the role of ESP in psychological life. This called for experimental procedures that were not limited to Rhine's favored forced-choice methodology. Such procedures have included [[dream telepathy]] experiments, and the [[ganzfeld experiment]]s (a mild sensory deprivation procedure).&lt;ref&gt;Marks, David; Kammann, Richard. (2000).

The [[scientific consensus]] does not view extrasensory perception as a real phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Cogan, Robert. (1998). ''Critical Thinking: Step by Step''. University Press of America. p. 227. {{ISBN|978-0761810674}} "When an experiment can't be repeated and get the same result, this tends to show that the result was due to some error in experimental procedure, rather than some real causal process. ESP experiments simply have not turned up any repeatable paranormal phenomena."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wynn, Charles M; Wiggins, Arthur W. (2001). ''Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends...and Pseudoscience Begins''. Joseph Henry Press. p. 165. {{ISBN|978-0309073097}} "Extrasensory perception and psychokinesis fail to fulfill the requirements of the scientific method. They therefore must remain pseudoscientific concepts until methodological flaws in their study are eliminated, and repeatable data supporting their existence are obtained."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zechmeister, Eugene B; Johnson, James E. (1992). ''Critical Thinking: A Functional Approach''. Brooks/Cole Pub. Co. p. 115. {{ISBN|0534165966}} "There exists no good scientific evidence for the existence of paranormal phenomena such as ESP. To be acceptable to the scientific community, evidence must be both valid and reliable."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, Milton A. (1988). ''A Physicist's Guide to Skepticism''. Prometheus Books. p. 193. {{ISBN|978-0-87975-440-2}} "Transmission of information through space requires transfer of energy from one place to another. Telepathy requires transmission of an energy-carrying signal directly from one mind to another. All descriptions of ESP imply violations of conservation of energy in one way or another, as well as violations of all the principles of information theory and even of the principle of causality. Strict application of physical principles requires us to say that ESP is impossible."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myers, David. (2004). ''Intuition: Its Powers and Perils''. Yale University Press. p. 233. {{ISBN|0-300-09531-7}} "After thousands of experiments, no reproducible ESP phenomenon has ever been discovered, nor has any researcher produced any individual who can convincingly demonstrate psychic ability."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Shermer|Shermer, Michael]].

''The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 249. {{ISBN|1-57392-021-5}} "Mainstream science is on the whole very dubious about ESP, and the only way that most scientists will be persuaded is by a demonstration that can be generally reproduced by neutral or even skeptical scientists. This is something that parapsychology has never succeeded in producing."&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics have pointed out that there is no viable theory to explain the mechanism behind ESP, and that there are historical cases in which flaws have been discovered in the experimental design of parapsychological studies.&lt;ref&gt;

There are many criticisms pertaining to experiments involving extrasensory perception, particularly surrounding methodological flaws. These flaws are not unique to a single experimental design, and are effective in discrediting much of the positive research surrounding ESP. Many of the flaws seen in the [[Zener cards]] experiment are present in the Ganzfeld experiment as well. First is the stacking effect, an error that occurs in ESP research. Trial-by-trial feedback given in studies using a “closed” ESP target sequence (e.g., a deck of cards) violates the condition of independence used for most standard statistical tests. Multiple responses for a single target cannot be evaluated using statistical tests that assume independence of responses. This increases likelihood of card counting and in turn, increases the chances for the subject to guess correctly without using ESP. Another methodological flaw involves cues through sensory leakage. For example, when the subject receives a visual cue. This could be the reflection of a Zener card in the holder’s glasses. In this case, the subject is able to guess the card correctly because they can see it in the reflection, not because of ESP. Finally, poor randomization of target stimuli could be happening. Poor shuffling methods can make the orders of the cards easier to predict, or the cards could’ve been marked and manipulated, again, making it easier to predict which cards come next.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, J. &amp; Wiseman, R. (1999). Does psi exist? Lack of replication of an anomalous process of information transfer. Psychological Bulletin, 125, 387–191. - meta-analysis of parapsychological research over 10 years following agreement on methodological criteria by proponents and skeptics.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The results of a meta-analysis found that when these errors were corrected and accounted for, there was still no significant effect of ESP. Many of the studies only appeared to have significant occurrence of ESP, when in fact, this result was due to the many methodological errors in the research.

The microscopic origin of the FQHE is a major research topic in condensed matter physics.

== Introduction==
{{unsolved|physics|2=What mechanism explains the existence of the ''&amp;nu;''=5/2 state in the fractional quantum Hall effect?}}
The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is a collective behaviour in a two-dimensional system of electrons. In particular magnetic fields, the [[2DEG|electron gas]] condenses into a remarkable liquid state, which is very delicate, requiring high quality material with a low [[charge carrier|carrier]] concentration, and extremely low temperatures. As in the integer [[quantum Hall effect]], the Hall resistance undergoes certain [[quantum Hall transitions]] to form a series of plateaus. Each particular value of the magnetic field corresponds to a filling factor (the ratio of electrons to magnetic flux quanta)

:&lt;math&gt;\nu = p/q,\ &lt;/math&gt;

where p and q are integers with no common factors. Here ''q'' turns out to be an odd number with the exception of two filling factors 5/2 and 7/2. The principal series of such fractions are

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over 3}, {2\over 5}, {3\over 7}, \mbox{etc.,} &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;{2\over3}, {3\over 5}, {4\over 7}, \mbox{etc.} &lt;/math&gt;

There were several major steps in the theory of the FQHE.

*'''Laughlin states and fractionally-charged [[quasiparticle]]s''': this theory, proposed by [[Robert B. Laughlin|Laughlin]], is based on accurate trial wave functions for the ground state at fraction &lt;math&gt;1/q&lt;/math&gt; as well as its quasiparticle and quasihole excitations. The excitations have fractional charge of magnitude &lt;math&gt;e^*={e\over q}&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''Fractional exchange statistics of [[quasiparticle]]s''': Bertrand Halperin conjectured, and Daniel Arovas, J. R. Schrieffer, and Frank Wilczek demonstrated, that the fractionally charged quasiparticle excitations of the Laughlin states are [[anyon]]s with fractional statistical angle &lt;math&gt;\theta = {\pi \over q}&lt;/math&gt;; the wave function acquires phase factor of  &lt;math&gt; e^{i \theta}&lt;/math&gt; (together with an Aharonov-Bohm phase factor) when identical quasiparticles are exchanged in a counterclockwise sense.   A recent experiment seems to give a clear demonstration of this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv |last=An |first=Sanghun |last2=Jiang |first2=P. |last3=Choi |first3=H. |last4=Kang |first4=W. |last5=Simon |first5=S.

W. |date=2011 |title=Braiding of Abelian and Non-Abelian Anyons in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect |eprint=1112.3400 |class=cond-mat.mes-hall }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Hierarchy states''': this theory was proposed by Duncan Haldane, and further clarified by Halperin, to explain the observed filling fractions not occurring at the Laughlin states' &lt;math&gt;\nu = 1/q&lt;/math&gt;. Starting with the Laughlin states, new states at different fillings can be formed by condensing quasiparticles into their own Laughlin states. The new states and their fillings are constrained by the fractional statistics of the quasiparticles, producing e.g. &lt;math&gt;\nu = 2/5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2/7&lt;/math&gt; states from the Laughlin &lt;math&gt;\nu = 1/3&lt;/math&gt; state. Similarly constructing another set of new states by condensing quasiparticles of the first set of new states, and so on, produces a hierarchy of states covering all the odd-denominator filling fractions. This idea has been validated quantitatively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=M.|year=1994|title=Microscopic formulation of the hierarchy of quantized Hall states|journal=[[Phys. Lett. B|Physics Letters B]]|volume=336|pages=48|arxiv=cond-mat/9311062|bibcode=1994PhLB..336...48G|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(94)00957-0|subscription=yes|author=Greiter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and brings out the observed fractions in a natural order. Laughlin's original plasma model was extended to the hierarchy states by MacDonald and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.H.|first2=G.C.|first3=M.W.C.|year=1985|title=Hierarchy of plasmas for fractional quantum Hall states|journal=[[Phys. Rev. B|Physical Review B]]|volume=31|issue=8|pages=5529|bibcode=1985PhRvB..31.5529M|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.31.5529|subscription=yes|author1=MacDonald|author2=Aers|author3=Dharma-wardana}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Composite fermions]]''': this theory was proposed by [[Jainendra K. Jain|Jain]], and further extended by [[Bertrand Halperin|Halperin]], Lee and Read. The basic idea of this theory is that as a result of the repulsive interactions, two (or, in general, an even number of) vortices are captured by each electron, forming integer-charged quasiparticles called composite fermions. The fractional states of the electrons are understood as the integer [[quantum Hall effect|QHE]] of composite fermions. For example, this makes electrons at filling factors 1/3, 2/5, 3/7, etc. behave in the same way as at filling factor 1, 2, 3, etc. Composite fermions have been observed, and the theory has been verified by experiment and computer calculations.  Composite fermions are valid even beyond the fractional quantum Hall effect; for example, the filling factor 1/2 corresponds to zero magnetic field for composite fermions, resulting in their Fermi sea.

The FQHE was experimentally discovered in 1982 by [[Daniel Chee Tsui|Daniel Tsui]] and [[Horst Ludwig Störmer|Horst Störmer]], in experiments performed on [[gallium arsenide]] [[heterostructure]]s developed by [[Arthur Gossard]].  Tsui, Störmer, and Laughlin were awarded the 1998 Nobel Prize for their work.

Fractionally charged quasiparticles are neither [[boson]]s nor [[fermion]]s and exhibit [[anyon]]ic statistics.  The fractional quantum Hall effect continues to be influential in theories about [[topological order]].  Certain fractional quantum Hall phases appear to have the right properties for building a [[topological quantum computer]].

== Evidence for fractionally-charged quasiparticles ==

Experiments have reported results that specifically support the understanding that there are fractionally-charged quasiparticles in an electron gas under FQHE conditions.

In 1995, the fractional charge of Laughlin quasiparticles was measured directly in a quantum antidot electrometer at [[State University of New York at Stony Brook|Stony Brook University]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=V.J.|first2=B.|year=1995|title=Resonant Tunneling in the Quantum Hall Regime: Measurement of Fractional Charge|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=267|issue=5200|pages=1010|bibcode=1995Sci...267.1010G|doi=10.1126/science.267.5200.1010|subscription=yes|lay-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031007040231/http://quantum.physics.sunysb.edu/index.html|lay-source=Stony Brook University, Quantum Transport Lab|lay-date=2003|author1=Goldman|author2=Su|pmid=17811442}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, two groups of physicists at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in [[Rehovot]], [[Israel]], and at the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique]] laboratory near [[Paris]], detected such quasiparticles carrying an [[electric current]], through measuring quantum [[shot noise]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Impact of fractional quantum Hall effect ==
The FQH effect shows the limits of Landau's [[symmetry breaking]] theory. Previously it was long believed that the symmetry breaking theory could explain all the important concepts and  essential properties of all forms of matter. According to this view the only thing to be done is to apply the [[symmetry breaking]] theory to all different kinds of phases and phase transitions.
From this perspective, we can understand the importance of the FQHE discovered by
Tsui, Stormer, and Gossard.

Different FQH states all have the same symmetry
and cannot be described by symmetry breaking theory.
Thus FQH states represent new states of matter that contain a
completely new kind of order—[[topological order]].
For example, properties once deemed isotropic for all materials may be anisotropic in 2D planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Selby|first=N.

new world beyond the paradigm of [[symmetry breaking]], waiting to be explored.  
The FQH effect opened up a new chapter in condensed matter physics.
The new type of orders represented by FQH states greatly enrich our
understanding of quantum phases and [[quantum phase transitions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rychkov VS, Borlenghi S, Jaffres H, Fert A, Waintal X |title=Spin torque and waviness in magnetic multilayers: a bridge between Valet-Fert theory and quantum approaches |journal=Phys.

The associated [[fractional charge]], [[fractional statistics]], [[non-Abelian statistics]],
chiral [[edge states]], etc. demonstrate the power and the fascination of [[emergence]] in many-body systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2147">In [[fluid dynamics]], the '''Froude–Krylov force'''—sometimes also called the '''Froude–Kriloff force'''—is a [[hydrodynamics|hydrodynamical]] [[force]] named after [[William Froude]] and [[Alexei Krylov]]. The Froude–Krylov force is the force introduced by the unsteady [[pressure]] [[Field (physics)|field]] generated by ''undisturbed'' [[Ocean surface wave|waves]]. The Froude–Krylov force does, together with the [[diffraction]] force, make up the total non-[[viscous]] forces acting on a floating body in regular waves. The diffraction force is due to the floating body disturbing the waves.

== Formulas ==

The Froude–Krylov force can be calculated from:

:&lt;math&gt;
 \vec F_{FK} = - \iint_{S_w} p ~ \vec n ~ ds,
&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;\vec F_{FK}&lt;/math&gt; is the Froude–Krylov force,
*&lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; is the wetted surface of the floating body,
*&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure in the undisturbed waves and
*&lt;math&gt;\vec n&lt;/math&gt; the body's [[surface normal|normal vector]] pointing into the water.

In the simplest case the formula may be expressed as the product of the wetted surface area (A) of the floating body, and the dynamic pressure acting from the waves on the body:

:&lt;math&gt;
F_{FK} = A \cdot p_{dyn} 
&lt;/math&gt;

The dynamic pressure, &lt;math&gt;p_{dyn}&lt;/math&gt;, close to the surface, is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
p_{dyn} = \rho \cdot g \cdot H/2
&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Properties_of_water#Density_of_saltwater_and_ice|sea water density]] (approx. 1030&amp;nbsp;kg/m³)
*&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard gravity|acceleration due to the earth’s gravity]] (9.81&amp;nbsp;m/s²)
*&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the wave height from [[Crest (physics)|crest]] to [[trough (physics)|trough]].

==History==

In the course of development of the [[ESEM]], the detectors previously employed in the vacuum of a [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM) had to be adapted for operation in gaseous conditions. The backscattered electron (BSE) detector was adapted by an appropriate geometry in accordance with the requirements for optimum electron beam transmission, BSE distribution and light guide transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Danilatos, G.D.|year=1985|title=Design and construction of an atmospheric or environmental SEM (part 3)|journal=Scanning|volume=7|pages=26–42|url=http://www.danilatos.com/part3/partiii26.html|doi=10.1002/sca.4950070102}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the corresponding secondary electron (SE) detector ([[Everhart-Thornley detector]]) could not be adapted, because the high potential required would cause a catastrophic breakdown even with moderate increase of pressure, such as low vacuum.

With appropriate control of electrode configuration and bias, detection of SE was achieved. A comprehensive survey dealing with the theory and operation of GDD has been published,&lt;ref name="theory"&gt;Danilatos, G.D.

==Principles and description==
[[File:GDD principle.svg|400 px|thumb|GDD principle]]
The GDD is in principle an adaptation of techniques for particle detection used in nuclear physics and astronomy. The adaptation involves the parameters required for the formation of images in the conditions of an electron microscope and in the presence of gas inside the specimen chamber. The signals emanating from the beam specimen-interaction, in turn, interact with the surrounding gas in the form of gaseous ionization and excitation. The type, intensity and distribution of signal-gas interactions vary. It is fortunate that generally the time-constant of these interactions is compatible with the time-constant required for the formation of images in the ESEM. The establishment of this compatibility constitutes the basis of the invention of GDD and the leap from particle physics to electron microscopy. The dominant signal-gas interactions are those by the BSE and SE, as they are outlined below.

In its simplest form, the GDD involves one or more electrodes biased with a generally low voltage (e.g. up to 20 V), which is sufficient to collect the ionization current created by whatever sources. This is much the same as an ionization chamber in particle physics. The size and location of these electrodes determine the detection volume in the gas and hence the type of signal detected. The energetic BSE traverse a long distance, whereas the SE travel a much shorter lateral distance mainly by way of diffusion in the gas. Correspondingly, an electrode placed further away from the beam axis will have a predominantly BSE component in comparison to the predominant SE component collected by an electrode placed close to the axis. The precise proportion of signal mix and intensity depends on the additional parameters of gas nature and pressure in conjunction with electrode configurations and bias, bearing in mind that there is no abrupt physical distinction between SE and BSE, apart from the conventional definition of the 50 eV boundary between them.

In another form, the GDD involves one or more electrodes as above but biased with a generally high voltage (e.g. 20–500 V). The processes involved are the same as in the low voltage case with the addition of an amplification of signal along the principle of a proportional amplifier as used in particle physics. That is, all slow electrons in the gas emanating either from the ionizing BSE or directly from the specimen (i.e. the SE) are multiplied in an avalanche form. The energy imparted on the traveling slow electrons by the external electrode field is sufficient to ionize the gas molecules through successive (cascade) collisions. The discharge is controlled in proportion by the applied electrode bias below the breakdown point. This form of detection is referred as ionization-GDD.&lt;ref name="theory" /&gt;

Parallel to the ionization, there is also excitation of the gas in both cases above. The gaseous photons are produced both by BSE and SE both directly and by cascade avalanche with the ionization electrons. These photons are detected by appropriate means, like photo-multipliers. By positioning [[Light tube]]s strategically, using filters and other light optics means, the SE can again be separated from the BSE and corresponding images formed. This form of detection is referred as scintillation-GDD.&lt;ref name="theory" /&gt;

==SE distribution and separation==
[[File:ESEM GDD efficiency.png|thumb|Efficiency characteristics of gaseous detection device in ESEM]]
The principles outlined above are best described by considering plane electrodes biased to form a uniform electric field, such as shown in the accompanying [[:File:GDD principle.svg|diagram of GDD-principle]]. The electron beam striking the specimen at the cathode effectively creates a point source of SE and BSE. The distribution of slow electrons emitted from a point source inside a gas acted upon by a uniform field is given from the equations (low field):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Huxley AG, Zaazou AA|year=1949|title=Experimental and theoretical studies of slow electrons in air|journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume=196|pages=402–426|doi=10.1098/rspa.1949.0035|issue=1046|bibcode = 1949RSPSA.196..402H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{I(r,d)}{\delta I_b}=1-\frac{1}{Q}\exp \left [ \frac{eV}{2kT\epsilon}(1-Q) \right ]&lt;/math&gt;{{pad|1em}} with {{pad|1em}} &lt;math&gt;Q=\left(1+\frac{r^2}{d^2}\right)^{1/2} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''''R''''' is the fraction of SE that arrives at the anode inside radius '''''r''''', '''''V''''' the potential difference between the electrodes placed at distance '''''d''''', '''''k''''' is Boltzmann’s constant, '''''T''''' the absolute gas temperature, '''''e''''' the electron charge and '''''ε''''' is the ratio of the thermal (agitation and kinetic) energy of the electrons divided by the thermal energy of the host gas; '''''I''''' is the corresponding current collected by the anode inside '''''r''''', '''''δ''''' is the SE yield coefficient and '''''I&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''''' the incident electron beam current. This provides the spatial distribution of the initial electrons SE as they are acted upon by the uniform electric field that moves them from the cathode to the anode, while the electrons also diffuse away due to thermal collisions with the gas molecules. Plots are provided in the accompanying [[:File:ESEM GDD efficiency.png|efficiency characteristics of the GDD]], for a set of operating conditions of pressure '''''p''''' and distance '''''d'''''. We note that a 100% collection efficiency is fast approached within a small radius even at moderate field strength. At high bias, a nearly complete collection is achieved within a very small radius, a fact that has favorable design implications.

The above radial distribution is valid also in the presence of formation of electron avalanches at high electric field, but it must be multiplied by an appropriate gain factor. In its simplest form for parallel electrodes,&lt;ref name="engel" /&gt; the gain factor is the exponential in the current equation:

&lt;math&gt;\ I(r,d)=\delta I_bR\exp(\alpha d)&lt;/math&gt;

where '''''α''''' is the first [[Townsend coefficient]]. This gives the total signal amplification due to both electrons and ions. The spatial charge distribution and gain factor varies with electrode configuration and geometry and by additional discharge processes described in the referenced theory of the GDD.
[[File:Ngas gain.png|thumb|GDD SE gain characteristics]]

==BSE distribution==
[[File:GDD implementation.svg|thumb|GDD implementation]]
The BSE usually have energies in the kV range so that the much lower electrode bias has only a secondary effect on their trajectory. For the same reason, the finite number of collisions with the gas also results in a second order deflection from their trajectory they would have in vacuum. Therefore, their distribution is practically the same as has been worked out by SEM workers, the variation of which depends on the specimen surface properties (geometry and material composition). For a polished specimen surface the BSE distribution assumes a nearly cosine function but for a rough surface we may take it to be spherical (i.e. uniform in all directions).&lt;ref name="equations"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Danilatos, G.D.|year=1990|title=Equations of charge distribution in the ESEM|journal=Scanning Microscopy|volume=4|issue=4|pages=799–823|url=http://www.danilatos.com/eqs/Eq799s.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For brevity, the equations of the second case only are given below. In vacuum, the current distribution from BSE on the electrode is given by

&lt;math&gt;\ I(r,d)=\eta I_b \left(1-\frac{1}{Q}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where '''''η''''' is the BSE yield coefficient.

In the presence of gas at low electric field the corresponding equations become:

&lt;math&gt;\ I(r,d)=\eta I_bpdS \left [ \frac{r}{d} \tan^{-1} \left( \frac {r}{d} \right)+ \ln Q \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

where '''''S''''' is the ionization coefficient of the gas and '''''p''''' its pressure

Finally, for a high electric field we get

&lt;math&gt;\ I(r,d)=\frac{1}{2} \eta I_bpS \int\limits_{0}^{d} \ln \left[ 1+\left( \frac{r}{h} \right)^2 \right] \exp\{\alpha (d-h)\}\,dh&lt;/math&gt;

For practical purposes, the BSE predominantly fall outside the volume acted upon by predominantly the SE, while there is an intermediate volume of comparable fraction of the two signals. The interplay of the various parameters involved has been studied in the main, but it also constitutes a new field for further research and development, especially as we move outside the plane electrode geometry.

==Electron and ion induction==

Prior to practical implementations, it is helpful to consider a more esoteric aspect (principle), namely, the fundamental physical process taking place in the GDD. The signal in the external circuit is a displacement current '''''i''''' created by induction of charge on the electrodes by a moving charge '''''e''''' with velocity '''''υ''''' in the space between them:

&lt;math&gt;i=\frac{e\upsilon}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

At the point in time when the charge arrives at the electrode, there is no current flowing in the circuit since '''''υ=0''''', only when the charge is in motion between the electrodes do we have a signal current. This is important in the case, for example, when a new electron-ion pair is generated at any point in the space between anode-cathode, say at '''''x''''' distance from the anode. Then, only a fraction '''''ex/d''''' of charge is induced by the electron during its transit to the anode, whilst the remainder fraction of '''''e(d–x)/d''''' charge is induced by the ion during its transit to the cathode. Addition of those two fractions gives a charge equal to the charge of one electron. Thus by counting the electrons arriving at the anode or the ions at the cathode we derive the same figure in current measurement. However, since the electrons have a drift velocity about three orders of magnitude greater (in nanosecond range) than the ions, the induced signal may be separated in two components of different significance when the ion transit time may become greater than the pixel time on the scanned image. The GDD has thus two inherent time-constants, a very short one due to the electrons and a longer one due to the ions. When the ion transit time is greater than the pixel dwell time, the useful signal intensity decreases together with an increase of signal background noise or smearing of image edges due to the ions lagging behind. As a consequence, the above derivations, which include the total electron and ion contributions must be modified accordingly with new equations for the case of fast scanning rates.&lt;ref name="equations" /&gt; The electrode geometry can be altered with a view to decrease the ion transit time as can be done with a needle or cylindrical geometry.

This fundamental approach helps also understand the so-called “[[scanning electron microscope#Scanning process and image formation|specimen absorbed current]]” mode of detection in the vacuum SEM, which is limited only to conductive specimens. Image formation of non-conductive specimens now possible in the ESEM, can be understood in terms of an induced displacement current in the external circuit via a capacitor-like action with the specimen being the dielectric between its surface and the underlying electrode.&lt;ref name="theory" /&gt; Therefore, the (misnomer) "specimen absorbed current" per se plays no part in any useful image formation except to dissipate the charge (in conductors), without which insulators cannot be generally imaged in vacuum (except in the rare case when the incident beam current equals the total emitted current).

==SE detector gain==

By use of a derivation for the Townsend coefficient given by von Engel,&lt;ref name="engel"&gt;A von Engel (1965) book "Ionised Gases" Oxford at the Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt; the gain factor '''''G''''', in the case of SE with total current collection '''''I&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;''''' (i.e. for '''''R=1'''''), is found by:

&lt;math&gt;\ G=\frac{I_{tot}}{\delta I_b}=\exp\left[Apd \exp \left(-B \frac{pd}{V} \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where '''''A''''' and '''''B''''' are tabulated constants for various gases. In the diagram supplied, we plot the [[:File:Ngas gain.png|gain characteristics]] for nitrogen with '''''A=9.0''''' and '''''B=256.5''''' valid in the range 75–450 V/(Pa·m) for the ratio '''''E/p'''''. We should note that in ESEM work the product '''''pd&lt;3''''' Pa·m, since at higher values no useful beam is transmitted through the gas layer to the specimen surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Danilatos GD |year=2009|title= Optimum beam transfer in the ESEM|journal= J. Microsc|volume= 234|pages=26–37|pmid=19335454|issue=1|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03148.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gray-shaded area shows the region of GDD operation provided also that the γ processes are very low and do not trigger a breakdown of the proportional amplification.&lt;ref name="theory" /&gt; This area contains the maxima of the gain curves, which further re-enforces the successful application of this technology to ESEM. The curves outside the shaded area can be used with beam energy greater than 30 kV, and in future development of environmental or atmospheric transmission scanning electron microscopes employing very high beam energy.

==General implementations==
[[File:GDD HF.svg|thumb|Contrast variation by GDD at high field]]
[[File:GDD LF.svg|thumb|Contrast variation by GDD at low field]]
The diagram showing the [[:File:GDD principle.svg|principle of GDD]] constitutes a versatile implementation that includes not only the SE mode but also the BSE and a combination of these. Even if only the SE signal is desirable to use alone, at least one additional concentric electrode is recommended to employ in order to help in the separation from interference of BSE and also from other noise sources such as the skirt electrons scattered out of the primary beam by the gas. This addition may act as a “guard” electrode, and by varying its bias independently from the SE electrode, the image contrast can be controlled purposefully. Alternative control electrodes are used such as a mesh between anode and cathode.&lt;ref name="theory" /&gt; A multipurpose array of electrodes below and above the specimen and above the pressure limiting aperture of the ESEM has also been described elsewhere.&lt;ref name="multi"&gt;{{US patent|4897545}}, filed October 14, 1988 (priority date October 16, 1987, Australia PI4918). Assigned to ElectroScan Corp. Inventor: GD Danilatos&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of this detector has required devoted electronics circuitry, especially when the signal is picked up by the anode at high bias, because the floating current amplified must be coupled at full bandwidth to the ground amplifier and video display circuits (developed by ElectroScan).&lt;ref name="multi" /&gt; An alternative is to bias the cathode with a negative potential and pickup the signal from the anode at floating ground without the need for coupling between amplifier stages. However, this would require extra precaution to protect users from exposure to a high potential at the specimen stage.

A further alternative that has been implemented at the laboratory stage is by the application of a high bias at the anode but by pickup of the signals from the cathode at floating ground, as shown in the [[:File:GDD implementation.svg|accompanying diagram]].&lt;ref name="mechanisms"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.danilatos.com/mechanisms/mech09.html|author=Danilatos, G.D.|year=1990|title= Mechanisms of detection and imaging in the ESEM|journal= J. Microsc.|volume= 160|pages=9–19|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.1990.tb03043.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentric electrodes (E2, E3, E4) are made on a copper-coated fiberglass [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) and a copper wire (E1) is added at the center of the disk. The anode is made again from the same PCB with a conical hole (400 micrometres) to act as a pressure limiting aperture in the ESEM. The exposed fiberglass material inside the aperture cone together with its surface above are coated with silver paint in continuity with the copper material of the anode electrode (E0), which is held at high potential. The cathode electrodes are independently connected to ground amplifiers, which, in fact, can be biased with low voltage directly from the amplifier power supplies in the range of ±15 volts without any further coupling required. On account of the induction mechanism operating behind the GDD, this configuration is equivalent to the previous diagram, except for the inverted signal that is electronically restored. While electrode E0 is held at 250 V, meaningful imaging is done as shown by a [[:File:GDD HF.svg|series of images]] with composition of signals from various electrodes at two pressures of supplied air. All images show part of the central copper wire (E1), exposed fiber-glass (FG, middle), and copper (part of E2) with some silver paint used to attach the wire. The close resemblance of (a) with (b) at low pressure and (c) with (d) at high pressure is a manifestation of the principle of equivalence by induction. The purest SE image is (e) and the purest BSE is (h). Image (f) has prevailing SE characteristics, whilst (g) has a comparable contribution of both SE and BSE. Images (a) and (b) are dominated by SE with some BSE contribution, whilst (c) and (d) have comparable contribution by both SE and BSE.

The very bright areas on the FG material result from genuine high specimen signal yield and not from erratic charging or other artifacts familiar with plastics in vacuum SEM. High yield of edges, oblique incidence, etc. can for the first time be studied from the true surfaces without obstruction in ESEM. Mild charging, if present, may produce stable contrast characteristic of material properties and can be used as a means for studies of the physics of the surfaces.&lt;ref name="mechanisms" /&gt; The images presented in this series are reproductions from photographic paper with limited bandwidth, on which attempting to bring up detail in dark areas results in saturating the bright areas and vice versa, whilst a lot more information is usually contained on the negative film. Electronic manipulation of the signal together with modern computer graphics can overcome some old imaging limitations.

An example of the GDD operating at low voltage is shown with [[:File:GDD LF.svg|four images of the same field]] of view of a polished mineral containing aluminum, iron, silicon and some unknown surface impurities. The anode electrode is a single thin wire placed on the side and below the specimen surface, several mm away from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Danilatos, G.D.|year=1986|title=Cathodoluminescence and gaseous scintillation in the environmental SEM|journal=Scanning|volume=8|pages=279–284|url=http://www.danilatos.com/scintillation/scint279.html|doi=10.1002/sca.4950080605}}&lt;/ref&gt; Image (a) shows predominantly SE contrast at low pressure, whilst (b) shows BSE material contrast at higher pressure. Image (c) shows [[cathodoluminescence]] (CL) from the specimen surface by use of water vapor (which does not scintillate), whilst (d) shows additional photon signal by changing the gas to air which scintillates by signal electrons originating from the specimen. The latter appears to be a mixture of CL with SE, but it may also contain additional information from the surface contaminant charging to a varying degree with gas pressure.

The GDD at high voltage has clear advantages over the low voltage mode, but the latter may be used easily with special applications such as at very high pressures where the BSE produce a high ionization gain from their own high energy, or in cases when the electric field requires shaping to purposeful ends. In general, the detector should be designed to operate at both high and low bias levels including variable negative (electron retarding) bias&lt;ref name="equations" /&gt; with important contrast generation.

Further improvements have been envisaged, such as the use of special electrode materials, gas composition and shaping the trajectory of detection electrons by special electric and magnetic fields (page 91).&lt;ref name="theory" /&gt;

'''Gene Ontology''' ('''GO''') '''term enrichment''' is a technique for interpreting sets of [[genes]] making use of the [[Gene Ontology]] system of classification, in which genes are assigned to a set of predefined bins depending on their functional characteristics. For example, the gene [[FasR]] is categorized as being a [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]], involved in [[apoptosis]] and located on the [[plasma membrane]].

Researchers performing high-throughput experiments that yield sets of genes (for example, genes that are differentially [[Gene Expression|expressed]] under different conditions) often want to retrieve a functional profile of that gene set, in order to better understand the underlying [[biological processes]]. This can be done by comparing the input gene set each of the bins (terms) in the GO – a [[statistical test]] can be performed for each bin to see if it is enriched for the input genes.

== Background ==

=== The Gene Ontology ===
{{Main|Gene Ontology}}

The Gene Ontology (GO) provides a system for hierarchically classifying genes or gene products to terms organized in a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] structure called an [[ontology]]. The terms are grouped into three categories: molecular function (describing the molecular activity of a gene), biological process (describing the larger cellular or physiological role carried out by the gene, coordinated with other genes) and cellular component (describing the location in the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] where the gene product executes its function). Each gene can be described (annotated) with multiple terms. The GO is actively used to classify genes from humans, [[model organisms]] and a variety of other species.

Using the GO it is possible to retrieve the set of terms used to describe any gene, or conversely, given a term, return the set of genes annotated to that term. For the latter query, the hierarchical system of the GO is employed to give complete results. For example, a query for the GO term for [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] should return genes annotated to the term "nuclear membrane".

=== Interpreting high throughput data ===

Certain types of high-throughput experiments (e.g. [[RNA seq]]) return sets of genes that are over or under expressed. The GO can be used to functionally profile this set of genes, to determine which GO terms appear more frequently than would be expected by chance when examining the set of terms annotated to the input genes. For example, an experiment may compare gene expression in healthy cells versus [[cancerous]] cells. Functional profiling can be used to elucidate the underlying cellular mechanisms associated with the cancerous condition. This is also called term enrichment or term overrepresentation, as we are testing whether a GO term is statistically enriched for the given set of genes.

== Methods ==

There are a variety of methods for performing a term enrichment using GO. Methods may vary according to the type of statistical test applied, the most common being a [[Fisher's exact test]] / [[hypergeometric test]]. Some methods make use of [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

| pmc = 2887944
}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also variability in the type of correction applied for [[Multiple comparisons]], the most common being [[Bonferroni correction]].

Methods also vary in their input – some take unranked gene sets, others ranked gene sets, with more sophisticated methods allowing each gene to be associated with a magnitude (e.g. expression level), avoiding arbitrary cutoffs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2607">[[Image:Henrik Nikolaj Kroeyer.jpg|right|thumb|154px|Henrik Nikolai Krøyer]] 
'''Henrik Nikolai Krøyer''' (22 March 1799 – 14 November 1870) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[zoologist]]. 

Born in [[Copenhagen]], he was a brother of the composer [[Hans Ernst Krøyer]]. He started studying medicine at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1817, which he later changed to [[history]] and [[philology]]. While a student, he was a supporter of the [[Philhellenism|Philhellenic]] movement, and he participated as a volunteer in the [[Greek War of Independence]] along with several fellow students. 

Upon his return to Denmark, Krøyer gained an interest in zoology. In 1827, he took the position as assistant teacher in [[Stavanger]], where he met, and later married, Bertha Cecilie Gjesdal. Bertha's sister, Ellen Cecilie Gjesdal, was deemed unfit to bring up her child, so Henrik and Bertha adopted the boy, who took on the name [[Peder Severin Krøyer]], and later became a well-known painter.

Krøyer returned to [[Copenhagen]] in 1830 where he was employed as a teacher in natural history at the Military Academy. As the course lacked a textbook, Krøyer wrote and published ''{{lang|da|Grundtræk til Vejledning ved naturhistorisk Undervisning}}'' (1833).

During his career he often travelled along the coasts of Denmark where he studied marine life, especially fish and [[crustacean]]s, and this resulted in his main work ''{{lang|da|Danmarks Fiske}}'' ("The Fish of Denmark", 3 volumes, 1838-1853). During his life visited most of the coasts of Western Europe as well as [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. But his health eventually deteriorated and in 1869 he had to take his leave of his position of head of the [[University of Copenhagen Zoological Museum|Natural Museum of Copenhagen]] which he had held since 1847. He gained the title of professor in 1853.

==Properties==

===Refractive index===

A typical polymer has a refractive index of 1.30–1.70, but a higher refractive index is often required for specific applications. The refractive index is related to the [[molar refractivity]], structure and weight of the monomer. In general, high molar refractivity and low molar volumes increase the refractive index of the polymer.&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt;

===Optical properties===
[[Optical dispersion]] is an important property of an HRIP. It is characterized by the [[Abbe number]]. A high refractive index material will generally have a small Abbe number, or a high optical dispersion.&lt;ref name=Matsuda&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tatsuhito Matsuda |author2=Yasuaki Funae |author3=Masahiro Yoshida |author4=Tetsuya Yamamoto |author5=Tsuguo Takaya |title=Optical material of high refractive index resin composed of sulfur-containing aromatic methacrylates|journal=J. Appl. Polym. Science|year=2000|volume=76|page=50|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4628(20000404)76:1&lt;50::AID-APP7&gt;3.0.CO;2-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A low birefringence has been required along with a high refractive index for many applications. It can be achieved by using different [[functional groups]] in the initial [[monomer]] to make the HRIP. [[Aromaticity|Aromatic]] monomers both increase refractive index and decrease the [[optical anisotropy]] and thus the birefringence.&lt;ref name=Seto /&gt;

[[File:Calcite.jpg|thumb|Example of birefringence]]

A high clarity (optical transparency) is also desired in a high refractive index polymer. The clarity is dependent on the refractive indexes of the polymer and of the initial monomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=P. Nolan |author2=M. Tillin |author3=D. Coates |title=High on-state clarity polymer dispersed liquid crystal films  |journal=Liquid Crystals|year=1993|volume=14|issue=2|pages=339|doi=10.1080/02678299308027648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermal stability===
When looking at thermal stability, the typical variables measured include [[glass transition]], initial [[decomposition temperature]], degradation temperature and the [[melting]] temperature range.&lt;ref name=Yen /&gt; The thermal stability can be measured by [[thermogravimetric analysis]] and [[differential scanning calorimetry]]. [[Polyesters]] are considered thermally stable with a degradation temperature of 410&amp;nbsp;°C. The decomposition temperature changes depending on the substituent that is attached to the monomer used in the [[polymerization]] of the high refractive index polymer. Thus, longer [[alkyl]] substituents results in lower thermal stability.&lt;ref name=Seto /&gt;

===Solubility===
Most applications favor polymers which are soluble in as many [[solvents]] as possible. Highly refractive [[polyesters]] and polyimides are soluble in common organic solvents such as [[dichloromethane]], [[methanol]], [[hexanes]], [[acetone]] and [[toluene]].&lt;ref name=Yen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Seto /&gt;

==Synthesis==

The synthesis route depends on the HRIP type. The Michael polyaddition is used for a polyimide because it can be carried out at room temperature and can used for [[step-growth polymerization]]. This synthesis was first succeeded with polyimidothiethers, resulting in optically transparent polymers with high refractive index.&lt;ref name=Yen /&gt; Polycondensation reactions are also common to make high refractive index polymers, such as polyesters and polyphosphonates.&lt;ref name=Seto /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macdonald|first=Emily K.|last2=Lacey|first2=Joseph C.|last3=Ogura|first3=Ichiro|last4=Shaver|first4=Michael P.|date=2017-02-01|title=Aromatic polyphosphonates as high refractive index polymers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014305716308709|journal=European Polymer Journal|volume=87|pages=14–23|doi=10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2016.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:michael addition.png|thumb|550px|center|Example of a Michael polyaddition]]
[[File:Polycondensation.png|thumb|550px|center|Example of a polycondensation]]

==Types==
High refractive indices have been achieved either by introducing substituents with high molar refractions (intrinsic HRIPs) or by combining high-n nanoparticles with polymer matrixes (HRIP nanocomposites).

===Intrinsic HRIP===
[[File:PIs.png|thumb|360px|A sulfur-containing polyimide with high refractive index]]

[[Sulfur]]-containing substituents including linear [[thioether]] and [[sulfone]], cyclic [[thiophene]], thiadiazole and [[thianthrene]] are the most commonly used groups for increasing refractive index of a polymer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jin-gang Liu |author2=Yasuhiro Nakamura |author3=Yuji Shibasaki |author4=Shinji Ando |author5=Mitsuru Ueda |title=High refractive index polyimides derived from 2,7-Bis(4-aminophenylenesulfanyl)thianthrene and aromatic dianhydrides|journal=Macromolecules|year=2007|volume=40|pages=4614|doi=10.1021/ma070706e|bibcode = 2007MaMol..40.4614L|issue=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jin-Gang Liu |author2=Yasuhiro Nakamura |author3=Yuji Shibasaki |author4=Shinji Ando |author5=Mitsuru Ueda |title=Synthesis and characterization of highly refractive polyimides from 4,4′-thiobis[(p-phenylenesulfanyl)aniline] and various aromatic tetracarboxylic dianhydrides|journal=J.

[[File:Wiki-halogen.png|thumb|160px|left|A halogen-containing polymethacrylate]]
[[Halogen]] elements, especially [[bromine]] and [[iodine]], were the earliest components used for developing HRIPs. In 1992, Gaudiana ''et al.'' reported a series of [[polymethylacrylate]] compounds containing lateral brominated and iodinated [[carbazole]] rings. They had refractive indices of 1.67–1.77 depending on the components and numbers of the halogen substituents.&lt;ref&gt;Russell A. Gaudiana, Richard A. Minns and Howard G. Rogers "High refractive index polymers" {{US patent|5132430}} (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent applications of halogen elements in [[microelectronic]]s have been severely limited by the [[WEEE]] directive and [[RoHS]] legislation adopted by the [[European Union]] to reduce potential pollution of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Emma Goosey|title=Brominated flame retardants: their potential impacts and routes into the environment|journal=Circuit World|year=2006|volume=32|pages=32|doi=10.1108/03056120610683603|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HRIP nanocomposite===
Hybrid techniques which combine an organic polymer matrix with highly refractive inorganic nanoparticles could result in high n values. The factors affecting the refractive index of a high-n nanocomposite include the characteristics of the polymer matrix, nanoparticles and
the hybrid technology between inorganic and organic components. The refractive index of a nanocomposite can be estimated as &lt;math&gt;{n_{comp}} = {\Phi_p}{n_p} + {\Phi_{org}}{n_{org}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;{n_{comp}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{n_p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{n_{org}}&lt;/math&gt; stand for the refractive indices of the nanocomposite, nanoparticle and organic matrix, respectively. &lt;math&gt;{\Phi_p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\Phi_{org}}&lt;/math&gt; represent the volume fractions of the nanoparticles and organic matrix, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lorenz Zimmermann |author2=Martin Weibel |author3=Walter Caseri |author4=Ulrich W.

The choice of nanoparticles is often influenced by their size and surface characteristics. In order to increase optical transparency and reduce [[Rayleigh scattering]] of the nanocomposite, the diameter of the nanoparticle should be below 25&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=H.

==Applications==

[[File:Matrixw.jpg|thumb|A CMOS image sensor]]

===Image sensors===
A [[microlens]] array is a key component of optoelectronics, optical communications, [[CMOS]] [[image sensors]] and [[displays]]. Polymer-based microlenses are easier to make and are more flexible than conventional glass-based lenses. The resulting devices use less power, are smaller in size and are cheaper to produce.&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt;

===Lithography===
Another application of HRIPs is in [[immersion lithography]]. It is a new technique for circuit manufacturing that uses both photoresists and high refractive index fluids. The photoresist needs to have an n value of greater than 1.90. It has been shown that non-aromatic, sulfur-containing HRIPs are the best materials for an optical photoresist system.&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt;

===LEDs===
[[File:RBG-LED.jpg|thumb|LEDs of the 5mm diffused type]]
Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are a common solid-state light source. High-brightness LEDs (HBLEDs) are often limited by the relatively low light extraction efficiency due to the mismatch of the refractive indices between the LED material ([[GaN]], n=2.5) and the organic encapsulant ([[epoxy]] or silicone, n=1.5). Higher light outputs can be achieved by using an HRIP as the encapsulant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Frank W. Mont |author2=Jong Kyu Kim |author3=Martin F. Schubert |author4=E.

IBM '''Information Management System''' ('''IMS''') is a joint [[hierarchical database]] and [[information management]] system with extensive [[transaction processing]] capabilities.

== History ==
[[International Business Machines|IBM]] designed the IMS with [[North American Rockwell|Rockwell]] and [[Caterpillar Tractor Company|Caterpillar]] starting in 1966 for the [[Apollo program]], where it was used to inventory the very large [[bill of materials]] (BOM) for the [[Saturn V]] moon rocket and Apollo space vehicle.

The first "IMS READY" message appeared on an [[IBM 2740]] terminal in [[Downey, California]], on 14 August 1968.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In the interim period, IMS has undergone many developments as IBM [[System/360]] technology evolved into the current [[z/OS]] and [[IBM zEnterprise System]] technologies.  For example, IMS now supports the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]], [[JDBC]], [[XML]], and, since late 2005, [[Web services]].

[[Vern Watts]] was IMS's chief architect for many years. Watts joined IBM in 1956 and worked at IBM's Silicon Valley development labs until his death on April 4, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;IBM IMS Newsletter ''[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dzichelp/v2r2/topic/com.ibm.imsnews2.doc/newsletters/v902/v902.htm Volume 902]''&lt;/ref&gt; He had continuously worked on IMS since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Luongo, Chris et al. (October 2008).  ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x98hgieE08o The Tale of Vern Watts]''.  International Business Machines Corporation. Retrieved April 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--IMS is reportedly IBM's highest revenue software product, and it continues to grow.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} not sure that I have right to comment it out. But I couldn't find any reliable sources of this statement in the web.--&gt;

== Database ==
The IMS Database component stores data using a [[hierarchical database|hierarchical model]], which is quite different from IBM's later released [[relational model|relational database]], [[IBM DB2|DB2]]. In IMS, the hierarchical model is implemented using blocks of data known as segments.  Each segment can contain several pieces of data, which are called fields.  For example, a customer database may have a root segment (or the segment at the top of the hierarchy) with fields such as phone, name, and age.  Child segments may be added underneath another segment, for instance, one order segment under each customer segment representing each order a customer has placed with a company.  Likewise, each order segment may have many children segments for each item on the order.  Unlike other databases, you do not need to define all of the data in a segment to IMS.  A segment may be defined with a size of 40 bytes but only define one field that is six bytes long as a key field that you can use to find the segment when performing queries.  IMS will retrieve and save all 40 bytes as directed by a program but may not understand (or care) what the other bytes represent.  In practice, often all data in a segment may map to a [[COBOL]] [[Copybook (programming)#COBOL|copybook]].  Besides [[DL/I]] query usage, a field may be defined in IMS so that the data can be hidden from certain applications for security reasons.  The database component of IMS can be purchased standalone, without the transaction manager component, and used by systems such as [[CICS]].

There are three basic forms of IMS hierarchical databases:

==="Full Function" databases===
*Directly descended from the [[Data Language Interface]] (DL/I) databases originally developed for Apollo, full function databases can have primary and secondary indexes, accessed using DL/I calls from an application program, like [[SQL]] calls to [[IBM DB2|DB2]] or [[Oracle database|Oracle]].
*Full function databases can be accessed by a variety of methods, although Hierarchical Direct (HDAM) and Hierarchical Indexed Direct ([[HIDAM]]) dominate. The other formats are Simple Hierarchical Indexed Sequential ([[SHISAM]]), Hierarchical Sequential ([[Access method#IMS|HSAM]]), and Hierarchical Indexed Sequential ([[HISAM]]).
*Full function databases store data using [[VSAM]], a native z/OS access method, or Overflow Sequential (OSAM), an IMS-specific access method that optimizes the I/O channel program for IMS access patterns. In particular, OSAM performance benefits from sequential access of IMS databases (OSAM Sequential Buffering).

==="Fast Path" databases===
*Fast Path databases are optimized for extremely high transaction rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://idcp.marist.edu/pdfs/ztidbitz/22%20zTidBits%20(IMS_Then&amp;ToDay).pdf IBM’s Information Management System (IMS)] Institute for Data Center Professionals&lt;/ref&gt; Data Entry Databases (DEDBs) and Main Storage Databases (MSDBs) are the two types of Fast Path databases. DEDBs use a direct (randomizer) access technique similar to Full Function HDAM and IMS V12 provided a DEDB Secondary Index function. MSDBs do not support secondary indexing. Virtual Storage Option (VSO) DEDBs can replace MSDBs in modern IMS releases, so MSDBs are gradually disappearing.
DEDB performance comes from use of high performance (Media Manager) access method, asynchronous write after commit, and optimized code paths. Logging is minimized because no data is updated on disk until commit, so UNDO (before image) logging is not needed, nor is a backout function. Uncommitted changes can simply be discarded.
Starting with IMS Version 11, DEDBs can use z/OS 64-bit storage for database buffers.
DEDBs architecture includes a Unit of Work (UOW) concept which made an effective online reorganization utility simple to implement. This function is included in the base product.

===High Availability Large Databases (HALDBs)===
*IMS V7 introduced HALDBs, an extension of IMS full function databases to provide better availability, better handling of extremely large data volumes, and, with IMS V9, online reorganization to support continuous availability. (Third party tools exclusively provided online reorganization prior to IMS V9.)  A HALDB can store in excess of 40 terabytes of data.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Rich et al. (June 2003).  ''[http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg246945.pdf The Complete IMS HALDB Guide All You Need to Know to Manage HALDBs]''.  International Business Machines Corporation. p. 4.  {{ISBN|0-7384-5343-9}}.  Retrieved on June 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fast path DEDBs can only be built atop VSAM. DL/I databases can be built atop either VSAM or OSAM, with some restrictions depending on database organization. Although the maximum size of a z/OS VSAM dataset increased to 128 TB a few years ago, IMS still limits a VSAM dataset to 4 GB (and OSAM to 8 GB). This "limitation" simply means that IMS customers will use multiple datasets for large amounts of data. VSAM and OSAM are usually referred to as the access methods, and the IMS "logical" view of the database is referred to as the database "organization" (HDAM, HIDAM, HISAM, etc.) Internally the data are linked using 4-byte pointers or addresses. In the database datasets (DBDSs) the pointers are referred to as RBAs (relative byte addresses).

Collectively the database-related IMS capabilities are often called '''IMS DB'''. IMS DB has grown and evolved over nearly four decades to support myriad business needs. IMS, with assistance from z/OS hardware - the Coupling Facility - supports N-way inter-IMS sharing of databases. Many large configurations involve multiple IMS systems managing common databases, a technique providing for scalable growth and system redundancy in the event of hardware or software failures.

== Transaction Manager ==
IMS is also a robust [[transaction manager]] ('''IMS TM''', also known as IMS DC)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; one of the "big three" classic transaction managers along with [[CICS]] and [[Tuxedo (software)|BEA (now Oracle) Tuxedo]].  A transaction manager interacts with an end user (connected through [[VTAM]] or [[TCP/IP]], including [[IBM 3270|3270]] and [[Web user interface]]s) or another application, processes a business function (such as a banking account withdrawal), and maintains state throughout the process, making sure that the system records the business function correctly to a data store. Thus IMS TM is quite like a Web application, operating through a [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI program]] (for example), to provide an interface to query or update a database. IMS TM typically uses either IMS DB or DB2 as its backend database.  When used alone with DB2 the IMS TM component can be purchased without the IMS DB component.

IMS TM uses a messaging and queuing paradigm. An IMS control program receives a transaction entered from a terminal (or Web browser or other application) and then stores the transaction on a [[message queue]] (in memory or in a dataset). IMS then invokes its scheduler on the queued transaction to start the business application program in a message processing region. The message processing region retrieves the transaction from the IMS message queue and processes it, reading and updating IMS and/or DB2 databases, assuring proper recording of the transaction. Then, if required, IMS enqueues a response message back onto the IMS message queue. Once the output message is complete and available the IMS control program sends it back to the originating terminal. IMS TM can handle this whole process thousands (or even tens of thousands) of times per second. In 2013 IBM completed a benchmark on IMS Version 13 demonstrating the ability to process 100,000 transactions per second on a single IMS system.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
Prior to IMS, businesses and governments had to write their own transaction processing environments. IMS TM provides a straightforward, easy-to-use, reliable, standard environment for high performance transaction execution.  In fact, much of the world's banking industry relies on IMS {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, including the U.S. [[Federal Reserve]].  For example, chances are that withdrawing money from an [[Automatic Teller Machine|automated teller machine]] (ATM) will trigger an IMS transaction.  Several Chinese banks have recently purchased IMS to support that country's burgeoning financial industry.

Today IMS complements [[IBM DB2|DB2]], IBM's [[relational database]] system, introduced in 1982.  In general, IMS performs faster than DB2 for the common tasks but may require more programming effort to design and maintain for non-primary duties. Relational databases have generally proven superior in cases where the requirements, especially reporting requirements, change frequently or require a variety of viewpoint "angles" outside the primary or original function.

A relational "[[data warehouse]]" may be used to supplement an IMS database. For example, IMS may provide primary ATM transactions because it performs well for such a specific task. However, nightly copies of the IMS data may be copied to relational systems such that a variety of reports and processing tasks may be performed on the data. This allows each kind of database to focus best on its relative strength.

'''Iben Browning''' (January 9, 1918 &amp;ndash; July 18, 1991) was an American business consultant, author, and "self-proclaimed [[climatologist]]."&lt;ref name="Farley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farley|first1=John E.|title=Earthquake Fears, Predictions, and Preparations in Mid-America|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 2}} He is most notable for having made various failed predictions of [[disaster]]s involving [[climate]], [[volcano]]es, [[earthquake]]s, and government collapse.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt;{{rp|p. 11}}

==Life and career==
Browning was born in [[Edna, Texas]], grew up in [[Jackson County, Texas]], and graduated from [[Southwest Texas State Teachers College]] in 1937, majoring in both math and physics.  During World War II, he served in the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]].  Subsequently, he earned an M.A. at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1947, and then his doctorate (Ph.D.) the following year at the same school.  His doctorate was in zoology, with minors in genetics and bacteriology.

Browning worked in various scientific fields, including artificial intelligence and bio-engineering, and eventually became interested in long-term weather forecasting and climate changes.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; He believed that climate fluctuations are caused by changes in the amount of particulate matter in the atmosphere mostly from volcanic activity.  He believed that volcanic activity can be triggered by land tidal forces caused by the Moon, Earth's elliptical orbit of the Sun, and the alignment of these three bodies.  His climate predictions assumed that the dust thrown into the atmosphere by those eruptions reflects sunlight, which results in climatic cooling.  Browning believed that climatic changes, especially cooling, are associated with increased troubles in human society, including famine, revolutions, and war.&lt;ref&gt;Winkless, Nels III and Browning, Iben. ''Climate and the Affairs of Men'', Fraser Publishing, 1975.  {{ISBN|0061295507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After founding ''The Browning Newsletter'' in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;[https://browningclimate.com/about/ https://browningclimate.com/about/]&lt;/ref&gt; Browning described his climatic theories and findings in ''Climate and the Affairs of Men'' (1975), which he co-authored with Nels Winkless III. At that time, he believed that Earth had been through a long warm period and was moving into a dangerous cooling phase.  He also declared that he had not detected any effect of human activity on the climate.

Browning received notoriety for his erroneous [[earthquake prediction#Browning|prediction]] that a major [[earthquake]] would occur on the [[New Madrid Fault]] around December 2 and 3, 1990. This prediction had no scientific legitimacy,&lt;ref name="Farley"/&gt;{{rp|p. 3}} and was largely ignored by credentialed seismologists, who thought it would give the prediction undeserved attention if they had debunked it in public.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt;{{rp|p. 21}} In spite of this it was widely reported in the national media, which promoted fear, anxiety, and hysteria&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt;{{rp|p. 3}} among residents of the Mississippi Valley. No earthquake occurred in that area on those dates. A study done by the USGS to understand the causes of the earthquake scare described Browning's methodology as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{citation

}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Browning wrote four books, held 90 patents, and served as a [[climatologist]] and business consultant to [[Paine Webber]] in various scientific and engineering fields.  He was married to the former Florence Pinto and had one daughter, Evelyn Browning-Garriss.,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.desmogblog.com/evelyn-browning-garriss https://www.desmogblog.com/evelyn-browning-garriss]&lt;/ref&gt; who succeeded him as editor of 'The Browning Newsletter'.  He lived his later years in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] and died at his home there on July 18, 1991 from a heart attack at the age of 73.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5DA1F38F933A15754C0A967958260 obituary], ''[[New York Times]]'', July 20, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Death Index&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. World War II Army Enlistment Records&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indian Council of Social Science Research''' ('''ICSSR''') is the national body overseeing research in the [[social sciences]] in India. It was established in [[New Delhi]] in 1969.{{r|epw|page=3606}} It provides funding to scholars and to a network of twenty-seven [[research institutes]],{{r|epw|page=3606}} among them:

* the [[Centre for Development Studies]], Thiruvananthapuram
* the [[Centre for Policy Research]], New Delhi
* the [[Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta]]
* the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]], Delhi
* the Centre for Multi-Disciplinary Development Research
* the [[Centre for Women's Development Studies]], Delhi
* the [[Govind Ballabh Pant Social Science Institute]], Allahabad
* the Indian Institute Of Economics, Hyderabad
* the [[Institute of Public Enterprise]], Hyderabad
* the [[Institute for Social and Economic Change]], Bangalore
* the [[Institute for Studies in Industrial Development]], New Delhi
* the [[Madras Institute of Development Studies]].

A large proportion of its budget is spent on its own administration; in 1996–1997, this amounted to 23% of total expenditure.{{r|epw|page=3607}} It has been described as an "oversized, unimaginative and inefficient bureaucrac[y]".{{r|epw|page=3604}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26022">The [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) is a [[signalling (telecommunications)|signalling]] [[communications protocol|protocol]] used for controlling communication sessions such as [[Voice over IP]] [[telephone call]]s. SIP is based around request/response transactions, in a similar manner to the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP). Each transaction consists of a SIP request (which will be one of several [[List of SIP request methods|request methods]]), and at least one response.&lt;ref name="RFC_3261"/&gt;{{rp|p11}}

SIP requests and responses may be generated by any SIP [[user agent]]; user agents are divided into clients (UACs), which initiate requests, and servers (UASes), which respond to them.&lt;ref name="RFC_3261"/&gt;{{rp|§8}} A single user agent may act as both UAC and UAS for different transactions:&lt;ref name="RFC_3261"/&gt;{{rp|p26}} for example, a [[SIP phone]] is a user agent that will be a UAC when making a call, and a UAS when receiving one. Additionally, some devices will act as both UAC and UAS for a single transaction; these are called Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs).&lt;ref name="RFC_3261"/&gt;{{rp|p20}}

SIP responses specify a three-digit integer response code, which is one of a number of defined codes that detail the status of the request. These codes are grouped according to their first digit as "provisional", "success", "redirection", "client error", "server error" or "global failure" codes, corresponding to a first digit of 1–6; these are expressed as, for example, "1xx" for provisional responses with a code of 100–199.&lt;ref name="RFC_3261"/&gt;{{rp|§7.2}} The SIP response codes are consistent with the [[List of HTTP status codes|HTTP response codes]], although not all HTTP response codes are valid in SIP.&lt;ref name="RFC_3261"/&gt;{{rp|§21}}

SIP responses also specify a "reason phrase", and a default reason phrase is defined with each response code.&lt;ref name="RFC_3261"/&gt;{{rp|§7.2}} These reason phrases can be varied, however, such as to provide additional information&lt;ref name="RFC_3261"/&gt;{{rp|§21.4.18}} or to provide the text in a different language.&lt;ref name="RFC_3261"/&gt;{{rp|§20.3}}

The SIP response codes and corresponding reason phrases were initially defined in RFC 3261.&lt;ref name="RFC_3261"/&gt; That RFC also defines a SIP Parameters [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) registry to allow other RFC to provide more response codes.&lt;ref name="RFC_3261"/&gt;{{rp|§27}}&lt;ref name="IANA"/&gt;

This list includes all the SIP response codes defined in [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] [[Request for Comment|RFC]]s and registered in the SIP Parameters IANA registry {{as of|2017|07|14|lc=y}}. This list also includes SIP response codes defined in obsolete SIP RFCs (specifically, RFC 2543), which are therefore not registered with the IANA; these are explicitly noted  as such.

The purity of [[gold]] alloys is expressed in [[karat (purity)|karats]], (UK: carats) which indicates the [[ratio]] of the minimum amount of gold (by [[mass]]) over 24 parts total. 24 karat gold is [[fine gold]] (24/24 parts), and the engineering standard{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} is that it be applied to alloys that have been refined to 99.9% or better purity ("3 nines fine"). There are, however, places in the world that allow the claim of 24kt. to alloys with as little as 99.0% gold ("2 nines fine" or "point nine-nine fine).{{citation needed|date=February 2016|reason=needs a citation, also needs to remove implied POV perjorative}} An alloy which is 14 parts gold to 10 parts alloy is 14 karat gold, 18 parts gold to 6 parts alloy is 18 karat, etc. This is becoming more commonly{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and more precisely expressed as a decimal fraction, i.e.: 14/24 equals .585 (rounded off), and 18/24 is .750 ("seven-fifty fine").

There are hundreds of possible alloys and mixtures possible, but in general the addition of silver will color gold green, and the addition of copper will color it red. A mix of around 50/50 copper and silver gives the range of yellow gold alloys the public is accustomed to seeing in the marketplace.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most iron alloys are [[steels]], with carbon as a major alloying element.

Recent [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) regulations have given rise to a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as [[dual-phase steel]], which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a formable, high strength steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dual-phase steel|publisher=Intota Expert Knowledge Services|url=http://www.intota.com/experts.asp?strSearchType=all&amp;strQuery=dual%2Dphase+steel|accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of [[austenite]] at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a [[phase transition]] to martensite without the addition of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Werner |first=Ewald |title=Transformation Induced Plasticity in low alloyed TRIP-steels and microstructure response to a complex stress history |url=http://www.wkm.mw.tum.de/Forschung/projekte_html/transtrip.html |accessdate=2007-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223184922/http://www.wkm.mw.tum.de/Forschung/projekte_html/transtrip.html |archivedate=December 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mirko |first=Centi |author2=Saliceti Stefano |title=Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP), Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) and Dual-Phase (DP) Steels |publisher=Tampere University of Technology |url=http://www.dimet.unige.it/resta/studenti/2002/27839/26/TWIP,TRIPandDualphase%20mirko.doc |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307200557/http://www.dimet.unige.it/resta/studenti/2002/27839/26/TWIP%2CTRIPandDualphase%20mirko.doc |archivedate=2008-03-07 |accessdate=2007-03-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon Steels are often [[hot-dip galvanizing|galvanized]], through hot-dip or electroplating in [[zinc]] for protection against rust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Galvanic protection|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stainless steels contain a minimum of 11% chromium, often combined with nickel, to resist [[corrosion]]. Some stainless steels, such as the [[Allotropes of iron|ferritic]] stainless steels are [[magnetic]], while others, such as the [[austenite|austenitic]], are nonmagnetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steel.org |title=Steel Glossary |publisher= [[American Iron and Steel Institute]] (AISI)|accessdate=2006-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrosion-resistant steels are abbreviated as CRES.

Some more modern steels include [[tool steel]]s, which are alloyed with large amounts of tungsten and [[cobalt]] or other elements to maximize [[solution hardening]]. This also allows the use of [[precipitation hardening]] and improves the alloy's temperature resistance.&lt;ref name=EM2/&gt; Tool steel is generally used in axes, drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other special-purpose alloys include [[weathering steel]]s such as Cor-ten, which weather by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aisc.org/MSCTemplate.cfm?Section=Steel_Interchange2&amp;Template=/CustomSource/Faq/SteelInterchange.cfm&amp;FaqID=2311 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222180444/http://aisc.org/MSCTemplate.cfm?Section=Steel_Interchange2&amp;Template=%2FCustomSource%2FFaq%2FSteelInterchange.cfm&amp;FaqID=2311 |archivedate=2007-12-22 |title=Steel Interchange |publisher=American Institute of Steel Construction Inc.

[[Eglin steel]] uses a combination of over a dozen different elements in varying amounts to create a relatively low-cost steel for use in [[bunker buster]] weapons. Hadfield steel (after Sir [[Robert Hadfield]]) or manganese steel contains 12–14% manganese which when abraded strain-hardens to form an incredibly hard skin which resists wearing. Examples include [[Continuous track|tank tracks]], [[bulldozer#Blade|bulldozer blade]] edges and cutting blades on the [[jaws of life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://answers.com/topic/hadfield-manganese-steel Hadfield manganese steel].

:Reported results from the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] satellite, which was developed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center to measure the diffuse infrared and microwave radiation from the early universe to the limits set by our astrophysical environment. Measurements by a Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) confirmed that the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) spectrum is that of a nearly perfect [[black body]] with a temperature of 2.725&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.002&amp;nbsp;K. This observation matches the predictions of the hot [[Big Bang]] theory extraordinarily well, and indicates that nearly all of the radiant energy of the Universe was released within the first year after the Big Bang. The first paper presents initial results; the second, final results.

:Presents results from the Differential Microwave Radiometer (DMR) on the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] satellite. This maps the cosmic radiation and searches for variations in brightness. The CMB was found to have intrinsic "anisotropy" for the first time, at a level of a part in 100,000. These tiny variations in the intensity of the CMB over the sky show how matter and energy was distributed when the Universe was still very young. Later, through a process still poorly understood, the early structures seen by DMR developed into galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the large scale structure that we see in the Universe today. The first paper presents initial results; the second, final results.

:Presents results from the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) on the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] satellite. This searches for the cosmic infrared background radiation produced by the first galaxies. Infrared absolute sky brightness maps in the wavelength range 1.25 to 240 micrometres were obtained to carry out a search for the cosmic infrared background (CIB). The CIB was originally detected in the two longest DIRBE wavelength bands, 140 and 240 micrometres, and in the short-wavelength end of the FIRAS spectrum. Subsequent analyses have yielded detections of the CIB in the near-infrared DIRBE sky maps. The CIB represents a "core sample" of the Universe; it contains the cumulative emissions of stars and galaxies dating back to the epoch when these objects first began to form.

:A finite system of deterministic nonlinear [[ordinary differential equations]] is introduced to represent forced dissipative [[fluid dynamics|hydrodynamic flow]], simulating simple phenomena in the real atmosphere. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and most of them nonperiodic, thus forcing to reevaluate the feasibility of long-term weather prediction. In this paper the [[Lorenz attractor]] is presented for the first time, and gave the first hint of what is now known as [[butterfly effect]].

Silberstein used [[biquaternion]]s to develop [[Minkowski space]] and [[Lorentz transformation]]s.

:Between 1876 and 1878 Gibbs wrote a series of papers collectively entitled "''On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances''", considered one of the greatest achievements in physical science in the 19th century and the foundation of the science of [[physical chemistry]]. In these papers Gibbs applied [[thermodynamics]] to the interpretation of physicochemical phenomena and showed the explanation and interrelationship of what had been known only as isolated, inexplicable facts. Gibbs' papers on heterogeneous equilibria included: some [[chemical potential]] concepts; some [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] concepts; a [[statistical ensemble|Gibbsian ensemble]] ideal (basis of the [[statistical mechanics]] field); and a ''[[Gibbs phase rule|phase rule]]''.

This is a listing of the [[reservoir]]s (artificial lakes) in the world with a surface area exceeding {{convert|500|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. Reservoirs can be formed conventionally, by damming the outlet of a canyon or valley to form a lake; the largest of this type is [[Ghana]]'s [[Lake Volta]], with a water surface of {{convert|8500|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. Reservoirs can also be formed by damming the outlets of natural lakes to regulate water levels, such as those at [[Uganda]]'s [[Owen Falls Dam]] ([[Lake Victoria]]) and [[Russia]]'s [[Irkutsk Dam]] ([[Lake Baikal]]). These are included and indicated with light blue cell background.

Large reservoir area does not necessarily coincide with [[List of reservoirs by volume|large volume]], as reservoirs with a large area tend to be shallow, such as at [[Suriname]]'s {{convert|1560|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} [[Brokopondo Reservoir]], with an average depth of just {{convert|13|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In comparison, [[Canada]]'s [[Kinbasket Lake]], with an average depth of {{convert|58|m|ft|abbr=on}}, has a volume 25 percent greater – but with a surface area of just {{convert|430|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, does not meet the cutoff for inclusion in this list.

The '''meridian circle''' is an instrument for timing of the passage of [[star]]s across the local [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]], an event known as a [[culmination]], while at the same time measuring their angular distance from the [[nadir]]. These are special purpose [[telescope]]s mounted so as to allow pointing only in the  [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]], the [[great circle]] through the north point of the horizon, the [[zenith]], the south point of the horizon, and the [[nadir]]. Meridian telescopes rely on the rotation of the Earth to bring objects into their [[field of view]] and are mounted on a fixed, horizontal, east–west axis.

The similar '''transit instrument''', '''transit circle''', or '''transit telescope''' is likewise mounted on a horizontal axis, but the axis need not be fixed in the east–west direction. For instance, a surveyor's [[theodolite]] can function as a transit instrument if its telescope is capable of a full revolution about the horizontal axis. Meridian circles are often called by these names, although they are less specific.

For many years, transit timings were the most accurate method of measuring the positions of heavenly bodies, and meridian instruments were relied upon to perform this painstaking work. Before [[spectroscopy]], [[photography]], and the perfection of [[reflecting telescope]]s, the measuring of positions (and the deriving of [[orbit]]s and [[Astronomical constant#Table of astronomical constants|astronomical constants]]) was the major work of [[observatory|observatories]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Importance==
[[File:Meridian circle 01.JPG|thumb|Meridian circle at Saint Petersburg Kunstkamera, built by T.L. Ertel, Germany, 1828]]

Fixing a telescope to move only in the [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] has advantages in the high-precision work for which these instruments are employed:
*The very simple mounting is easier to manufacture and maintain to a high precision.
*At most locations on the Earth, the meridian is the only [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] in which [[Celestial coordinate system|celestial coordinates]] can be indexed directly with such a simple mounting; the [[equatorial coordinate system]] aligns naturally with the meridian at all times. Revolving the telescope about its axis moves it directly in [[declination]], and objects move through its field of view in [[right ascension]].
*All objects in the sky are subject to the distortion of [[atmospheric refraction]], which tends to make objects appear slightly higher in the sky than they actually are. At the meridian, this distortion is in [[declination]] only, and is easily accounted for; elsewhere in the sky, refraction causes a complex distortion in coordinates which is more difficult to reduce. Such complex analysis is not conducive to high precision.

The state of the art of meridian instruments of the late 19th and early 20th century is described here, giving some idea of the precise methods of construction, operation and adjustment employed.&lt;ref&gt;

===Construction===

The earliest transit [[telescope]] was not placed in the middle of the axis, but nearer to one end, to prevent the axis from bending under the [[weight]] of the telescope. Later, it was usually placed in the centre of the axis, which consisted of one piece of [[brass]] or [[gun metal]] with turned cylindrical steel pivots at each end. Several instruments were made entirely of [[steel]], which was much more rigid than brass. The pivots rested on V-shaped [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], either set into massive stone or brick piers which supported the instrument, or attached to metal frameworks on the tops of the piers. The temperature of the bearings was monitored by thermometers.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The piers were usually separate from the foundation of the building, to prevent transmission of vibration from the building to the telescope. To relieve the pivots from the weight of the instrument, which would have distorted their shape, each end of the axis was supported by a hook with [[friction rollers]], suspended from a [[lever]] supported by the pier, [[Counterweight|counterbalanced]] so as to leave only about 10 [[pounds force]] (45 [[Newton (unit)|N]]) on each bearing. In some cases, the counterweight pushed up on the bearing from below.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Bond and Winlock (1876), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The bearings were set nearly in a true east–west line, but fine adjustment was possible by horizontal and vertical screws. A [[spirit level]] was used to monitor for any inclination of the axis to the horizon. Eccentricity (an off-center condition) of the telescope's axis was accounted for, in some cases, by providing another telescope through the axis itself. By observing the motion of an artificial star through this axis telescope as the main telescope was rotated, the shape of the pivots, and any wobble of the axis, could be determined.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Bond and Winlock (1876), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Transit circle microscope.png|thumb|Top view of a circle-reading microscope; from Norton (1867).]]

Near each end of the axis, attached to the axis and turning with it, was a circle or wheel for measuring the [[angle]] of the telescope to the horizon. Generally of 3&amp;nbsp;[[Foot (unit)|feet]] to 3.5&amp;nbsp;ft diameter, it was divided to 2 or 5 [[Minute of arc|arcminutes]], on a slip of silver set into the face of the circle near the circumference. These [[Graduation (instrument)|graduations]] were read by [[microscope]]s, generally four for each circle, mounted to the piers or a framework surrounding the axis, at 90° intervals around the circles. By averaging the four readings the eccentricity (from inaccurate centering of the circles) and the errors of graduation were greatly reduced. Each microscope was furnished with a [[micrometer]] screw, which moved [[crosshair]]s, with which the distance of the circle graduations from the centre of the field of view could be measured. The drum of the screw was divided to measure single seconds of arc (0.1" being estimated), while the number of revolutions were counted by a kind of comb in the field of view. The microscopes were placed at such a distance from the circle that one revolution of the screw corresponded to 1 arcminute (1') on the circle. The error was determined occasionally by measuring standard intervals of 2' or 5' on the circle. The periodic errors of the screw were accounted for. On some instruments, one of the circles was graduated and read more coarsely than the other, and was used only in finding the target stars.

The telescope consisted of two tubes screwed to the central cube of the axis. The tubes were usually conical and as stiff as possible to help prevent [[bending|flexure]]. The connection to the axis was also as firm as possible, as flexure of the tube would affect [[declination]]s deduced from observations. The flexure in the horizontal position of the tube was determined by two [[collimator]]s - telescopes placed horizontally in the meridian, north and south of the transit circle, with their [[Objective (optics)|objective lenses]] towards it. These were pointed at one another (through holes in the tube of the telescope, or by removing the telescope from its mount) so that the crosshairs in their foci coincided. The collimators were often permanently mounted in these positions, with their objectives and eyepieces fixed to separate piers.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Bond and Winlock (1876), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The meridian telescope was pointed to one collimator and then the other, moving through exactly 180°, and by reading the circle the amount of flexure (the amount the readings differed from 180°) was found. Absolute flexure, that is, a fixed bend in the tube, was detected by arranging that [[eyepiece]] and objective lens could be interchanged, and the average of the two observations of the same star was free from this error.

Parts of the apparatus were sometimes enclosed in glass cases to protect them from dust. These cases had openings for access. Other parts were closed against dust by removable silk covers.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Bond and Winlock (1876), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain instrumental errors could be averaged out by reversing the telescope on its mounting. A carriage was provided, which ran on rails between the piers, and on which the axis, circles and telescope could be raised by a screw-jack, wheeled out from between the piers, turned 180°, wheeled back, and lowered again.

The observing building housing the meridian circle did not have a rotating dome, as is often seen at observatories. Since the telescope observed only in the meridian, a vertical slot in the north and south walls, and across the roof between these, was all that was necessary. The building was unheated and kept as much as possible at the temperature of the outside air, to avoid air currents which would disturb the telescopic view. The building also housed the clocks, recorders, and other equipment for making observations.

===Operation===
At the [[Focus (optics)|focal plane]], the eye end of the telescope had a number of vertical and one or two horizontal wires ([[crosshair]]s). In observing stars, the telescope was first directed downward at a basin of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] forming a perfectly horizontal mirror and reflecting an image of the crosshairs back up the telescope tube. The crosshairs were adjusted until coincident with their reflection, and the line of sight was then perfectly vertical; in this position the circles were read for the ''[[nadir]] point''.

The telescope was next brought up to the approximate [[declination]] of the target star by watching the finder circle. The instrument was provided with a clamping apparatus, by which the observer, after having set the approximate declination, could clamp the axis so the telescope could not be moved in declination, except very slowly by a fine [[Screw (simple machine)|screw]]. By this slow motion, the telescope was adjusted until the star moved along the horizontal wire (or if there were two, in the middle between them), from the east side of the field of view to the west. Following this, the circles were read by the microscopes for a measurement of the apparent [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] of the star. The difference between this measurement and the nadir point was the ''nadir distance'' of the star. A movable horizontal wire or declination-micrometer was also used.

Another method of observing the apparent [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] of a star was to take half of the angular distance between the star observed directly and its reflection observed in a basin of mercury. The average of these two readings was the reading when the line of sight was horizontal, the ''horizontal point'' of the circle. The small difference in [[latitude]] between the telescope and the basin of mercury was accounted for.

The vertical wires were used for observing transits of stars, each wire furnishing a separate result. The time of transit over the middle wire was estimated, during subsequent analysis of the data, for each wire by adding or subtracting the known interval between the middle wire and the wire in question. These known intervals were predetermined by timing a star of known declination passing from one wire to the other, the [[pole star]] being best on account of its slow motion.

Timings were originally made by an "eye and ear" method, estimating the interval between two beats of a clock. Later, timings were registered by pressing a key, the electrical signal making a mark on a [[Chart recorder|strip recorder]]. Later still, the eye end of the telescope was usually fitted with an ''impersonal [[micrometer]]'', a device which allowed matching a vertical crosshair's motion to the star's motion. Set precisely on the moving star, the crosshair would trigger the electrical timing of the meridian crossing, removing the observer's [[personal equation]] from the measurement.&lt;ref&gt;
Chauvenet (1868), p. 138, art. 121
&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of the wires could be illuminated; the lamps were placed at some distance from the piers in order not to heat the instrument, and the light passed through holes in the piers and through the hollow axis to the center, whence it was directed to the eye-end by a system of [[Prism (optics)|prism]]s.

To determine absolute declinations or polar distances, it was necessary to determine the observatory's [[colatitude]], or distance of the [[celestial pole]] from the [[zenith]], by observing the upper and lower culmination of a number of [[circumpolar star]]s. The difference between the circle reading after observing a star and the reading corresponding to the zenith was the zenith distance of the star, and this plus the colatitude was the north polar distance. To determine the zenith point of the circle, the telescope was directed vertically downwards at a basin of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], the surface of which formed an absolutely horizontal mirror. The observer saw the horizontal wire and its reflected image, and moving the telescope to make these coincide, its optical axis was made perpendicular to the plane of the horizon, and the circle reading was 180°&amp;nbsp;+ zenith point.

In observations of stars [[Atmospheric refraction|refraction]] was taken into account as well as the errors of graduation and flexure. If the bisection of the star on the horizontal wire was not made in the centre of the field, allowance was made for curvature, or the deviation of the star's path from a great circle, and for the inclination of the horizontal wire to the horizon. The amount of this inclination was found by taking repeated observations of the zenith distance of a star during the one transit, the pole star being the most suitable because of its slow motion.

Attempts were made to record the transits of a star photographically. A [[photographic plate]] was placed in the focus of a transit instrument and a number of short exposures made, their length and the time being registered automatically by a clock. The exposing shutter was a thin strip of steel, fixed to the armature of an electromagnet. The plate thus recorded a series of dots or short lines, and the vertical wires were photographed on the plate by throwing light through the objective lens for one or two seconds.

===Adjustment===
[[Image:Chabot's meridian transit telescope.jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|[[Chabot Space &amp; Science Center]]'s meridian transit telescope, built by Fauth, 1885. Note the observer's chair between the piers, and the narrow opening in the wall and roof for access to the sky. Because the telescope observes only in the meridian, no rotating dome is necessary.]]

Meridian circles required precise adjustment to do accurate work.&lt;ref&gt;
Norton (1867), p. 33ff
&lt;/ref&gt;

The rotation axis of the main telescope needed to be exactly horizontal. A sensitive [[spirit level]], designed to rest on the pivots of the axis, performed this function. By adjusting one of the V-shaped bearings, the bubble was centered.

The line of sight of the telescope needed to be exactly perpendicular to the axis of rotation. This could be done by sighting a distant, stationary object, lifting and reversing the telescope on its bearings, and again sighting the object. If the crosshairs did not intersect the object, the line of sight was halfway between the new position of the crosshairs and the distant object; the crosshairs were adjusted accordingly and the process repeated as necessary. Also, if the rotation axis was known to be perfectly horizontal, the telescope could be directed downward at a basin of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and the crosshairs illuminated. The mercury acted as a perfectly horizontal mirror, reflecting an image of the crosshairs back up the telescope tube. The crosshairs could then be adjusted until coincident with their reflection, and the line of sight was then perpendicular to the axis.

The line of sight of the telescope needed to be exactly within the plane of the meridian. This was done approximately by building the piers and the bearings of the axis on an east–west line. The telescope was then brought into the meridian by repeatedly timing the (apparent, incorrect) upper and lower meridian transits of a [[circumpolar star]] and adjusting one of the bearings horizontally until the interval between the transits was equal. Another method used calculated meridian crossing times for particular stars as established by other observatories. This was an important adjustment, and much effort was spent in perfecting it.

In practice, none of these adjustments were perfect. The small errors introduced by the imperfections were mathematically corrected during the analysis of the data.

==Zenith telescopes==
{{main|Zenith telescope}}
Some telescopes designed to measure star transits are [[zenith telescope]]s designed to point straight up at or near the [[zenith]] for extreme precision measurement of star positions. They use an [[altazimuth mount]], instead of a meridian circle, fitted with leveling screws. Extremely sensitive levels are attached to the telescope mount to make angle measurements and the telescope has an eyepiece fitted with a [[micrometer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Geodesy |volume=11 |first1=Alexander Ross |last1=Clarke |first2=Friedrich Robert |last2=Helmert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Overview===
The idea of having an instrument ([[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]) fixed in the plane of the meridian occurred even to the [[ancient history|ancient]] [[astronomy|astronomers]] and is mentioned by [[Ptolemy]], but it was not carried into practice until [[Tycho Brahe]] constructed a large meridian quadrant.

Meridian circles have been used since the 18th century to accurately measure positions of stars in order to [[Star catalogue|catalog]] them. This is done by measuring the instant when the star passes through the local meridian. Its [[altitude (astronomy)|altitude]] above the horizon is noted as well. Knowing one's geographic [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] these measurements can be used to derive the star's [[right ascension]] and [[declination]].

Once good star catalogs were available a transit telescope could be used anywhere in the world to accurately measure local longitude and time by observing local meridian transit times of catalogue stars. Prior to the invention of the [[atomic clock]] this was the most reliable source of accurate time.

===Antiquity===
In the ''[[Almagest]]'', Ptolemy describes a meridian circle which consisted of a fixed graduated outer ring and a movable inner ring with tabs that used a shadow to set the Sun's position. It was mounted vertically and aligned with the meridian. The instrument was used to measure the altitude of the Sun at noon in order to determine the path of the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ptolemy|first=Claudius|author2=Toomer, G. J. |authorlink2=G. J. Toomer |title=Ptolemy's Almagest|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|date=1998|isbn=0-691-00260-6|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
[[Image:20060825 Ole Rømer's Instruments.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The world's first meridian circle from [[Ole Rømer]]'s [[Observatorium Tusculanum]]]]A meridian circle enabled the observer to simultaneously determine [[right ascension]] and [[declination]], but it does not appear to have been much used for right ascension during the 17th century, the method of equal altitudes by portable quadrants or measures of the angular distance between stars with an [[sextant (astronomical)|astronomical sextant]] being preferred. These methods were very inconvenient, and in 1690, [[Ole Rømer]] invented the transit instrument.

===18th century===
The transit instrument consists of a horizontal axis in the direction east and west resting on firmly fixed supports, and having a [[telescope]] fixed at right angles to it, revolving freely in the plane of the meridian. At the same time Rømer invented the altitude and [[azimuth]] instrument for measuring vertical and horizontal angles, and in 1704, he combined a vertical circle with his transit instrument, so as to determine both co-ordinates at the same time.

This latter idea was, however, not adopted elsewhere, although the transit instrument soon came into universal use (the first one at [[Greenwich]] being mounted in 1721), and the [[mural quadrant]] continued until the end of the century to be employed for determining declinations. The advantages of using a whole circle, it being less liable to change its figure and not requiring reversal in order to observe stars north of the zenith, were then again recognized by [[Jesse Ramsden]], who also improved the method of reading off angles by means of a [[micrometer]] [[microscope]] as described below.

===19th century===
[[File:TransitCircle USNO.jpg|thumb|The 6-inch transit circle of the U.S. Naval Observatory, built by Warner and Swasey, 1898]]

The making of circles was shortly afterwards taken up by [[Edward Troughton]], who constructed the first modern transit circle in 1806 for [[Stephen Groombridge|Groombridge]]'s [[observatory]] at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], the [[Groombridge Transit Circle]] (a meridian transit circle). Troughton afterwards abandoned the idea and designed the mural circle to take the place of the mural quadrant.

In the United Kingdom, the transit instrument and mural circle continued until the middle of the 19th century to be the principal instrument in observatories, the first transit circle constructed there being that at Greenwich (mounted in 1850). However, on the continent, the transit circle superseded them from the years 1818–1819, when two circles by [[Johann Georg Repsold]] and [[Georg Friedrich von Reichenbach]] were mounted at [[Göttingen]], and one by Reichenbach at [[Königsberg]]. The firm of Repsold and Sons was for a number of years eclipsed by that of [[Pistor and Martins]] in Berlin, who furnished various observatories with first-class instruments. Following the death of Martins, the Repsolds again took the lead and made many transit circles. The observatories of [[Harvard College]], [[Cambridge University]] and [[Edinburgh University]] had large circles by [[Troughton and Simms]].

The Airy Transit Circles at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] (1851) and that at the [[Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope]] (1855) were made by [[Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies|Ransomes and May]] of Ipswich. The Greenwich instrument had optical and instrumental work by Troughton and Simms to the design of [[George Biddell Airy]].

===20th century and beyond===
[[File:FASTT Transit Circle.jpg|thumb|200px|The Ron Stone/Flagstaff Astrometric Scanning Transit Telescope of the U.S.Naval Observatory, built by Farrand Optical Company, 1981]]

A modern-day example of this type of telescope is the 8&amp;nbsp;inch (~0.2m) Flagstaff Astrometric Scanning Transit Telescope (FASTT) at the [[United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station|USNO Flagstaff Station Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nofs.navy.mil/about_NOFS/telescopes/fastt.html&lt;/ref&gt; Modern meridian circles are usually automated. The observer is replaced with a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] camera. As the sky drifts across the field of view, the image built up in the CCD is clocked across (and out of) the chip at the same rate. This allows some improvements:&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The CCD can collect light for as long as the image is crossing it, allowing a dimmer limiting [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] to be reached.
*The data can be collected for as long as the telescope is in operation - an entire night is possible, allowing a strip of sky many degrees in length to be scanned.
*Data can be compared directly to any reference object which happens to be within the scan - usually a bright extragalactic object, like a [[quasar]], with an accurately-known position. This eliminates the need for some of the painstaking adjustment of the meridian instrument, although monitoring of [[declination]], [[azimuth]], and [[Horizontal plane|level]] is still performed with CCD scanners and [[Interferometry|laser interferometers]].
*[[Atmospheric refraction]] can be accounted for automatically, by monitoring [[temperature]], [[pressure]], and [[dew point]] of the [[air]] electronically.
*Data can be [[Computer data storage|stored]] and analyzed at will.

The first automated instrument was the [[Carlsberg Automatic Meridian Circle]], which came online in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~dwe/SRF/camc.html  The Carlsberg Meridian Telescope] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528070240/http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~dwe/SRF/camc.html |date=2010-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Northrop Grumman X-47''' is a demonstration [[UCAV|Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle]]. The X-47 began as part of [[Defense Advanced Research Project Agency|DARPA]]'s [[Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems|J-UCAS]] program, and is now part of the [[United States Navy]]'s [[UCAS-D]] program to create a carrier-based unmanned aircraft. Unlike the [[Boeing X-45]], initial Pegasus development was company-funded.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The original vehicle carries the designation '''X-47A Pegasus''', while the follow-on naval version is designated [[Northrop Grumman X-47B|X-47B]].

==Design and development==

The US Navy did not commit to practical UCAV efforts until mid-2000, when the service awarded contracts of US$2 million each to [[Boeing]] and [[Northrop  Grumman]] for a 15-month concept-exploration program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=2527 "DARPA And Navy Select Naval UCAV Contractors"], US DoD, 20 June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Design considerations for a naval UCAV included dealing with the corrosive salt-water environment, deck handling for launch and recovery, integration with command and control systems, and operation in a carrier's high electromagnetic interference environment. The Navy was also interested in using their UCAVs for reconnaissance missions, penetrating protected airspace to identify targets for the attack waves.

The Navy went on to give Northrop Grumman a contract for a naval UCAV demonstrator with the designation of "X-47A Pegasus", in early 2001. The proof-of-concept X-47A vehicle was built under contract by [[Burt Rutan]]'s [[Scaled Composites]] at the [[Mojave Spaceport]].  The Pegasus demonstrator looks like a simple black arrowhead with no vertical tailplane. It has a leading edge sweep of 55 degrees and a trailing edge sweep of 35 degrees. The demonstrator has retractable tricycle landing gear, with a one-wheel nose gear and dual-wheel main gear, and has six control surfaces, including two elevons and four "inlaids". The inlaids are small flap structures mounted on the top and bottom of the wing forward of the wingtips.

The X-47A is powered by a single [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada]] [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada JT15D|JT15D-5C]] small high-bypass turbofan engine with 3,190 [[lbf]] (14.2&amp;nbsp;kN) thrust. This engine is currently in use with operational aircraft such as the [[Aermacchi S-211]] trainer. The engine is mounted on the demonstrator's back, with the inlet on top behind the nose. The inlet duct has a serpentine diffuser to prevent radar reflections off the engine fan. However, to keep costs low, the engine exhaust is a simple cylindrical tailpipe, with no provisions for reducing radar or infrared signature.

The X-47A's airframe is built of composite materials, with construction subcontracted out to Burt Rutan's [[Scaled Composites]] company, which had the expertise and tooling to do the job inexpensively. The airframe consists of four main assemblies, split down the middle with two assemblies on top and two on bottom.

The X-47A was rolled out on 30 July 2001 and performed its first flight on 23 February 2003 at the US Naval Air Warfare Center at China Lake, California. The flight test program did not involve weapons delivery, but Pegasus does have two weapons bays, one on each side of the engine, that may be each loaded with a single 500 [[pound (mass)|pound]] (225&amp;nbsp;kg) dummy bomb to simulate operational flight loads. The Pegasus was also used to evaluate technologies for carrier deck landings, though the demonstrator did not have an arrestor hook. Other issues related to carrier operations involve adding deck tie-downs without compromising stealth characteristics, and designing access panels so that they would not be blown around or damaged by strong winds blowing across the carrier deck.  The J-UCAS program was terminated in February 2006 following the US military's [[Quadrennial Defense Review]].  The US Air Force and US Navy proceeded with their own UAV programs.  The Navy selected Northrop Grumman's  X-47B as its Unmanned Combat Air System demonstrator (UCAS-D) program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/x47/ X-47 Pegasus Naval Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV-N), USA].

[[Image:Pyrn small.jpg|frame|right|PYRN's official logo. It is a reminder of a typical temperature curve describing permafrost occurrence]]
The '''Permafrost Young Researcher’s Network (PYRN)''' is a network formed in 2005 to formally facilitate and strengthen contacts among young scientists in the [[permafrost]] community. It arose from the need for an integrated single source of information for specific resources vital to young scientists (fellowships, conference travel funding, position opportunities, etc.). Additionally, the imminence of the [[International Polar Year]] (IPY) prompted the need for a visible representation of the young permafrost community at the international level. The Permafrost Young Researchers Network has therefore been formally established within the [[International Permafrost Association]] (IPA) framework and has created and maintains means of communication among young researchers involved in permafrost research. It reports on young researchers’ activities to the IPA membership and working parties and represents permafrost scientists and engineers within broader international and national assemblages.

==Activities==

The PYRN website is hosted by the Arctic Portal [http://www.arcticportal.org]. On the site information on conferences, events, job and graduate positions, research and other topics related to permafrost science is available. It distributes an electronic newsletter to the young researchers’ communities related to the aforementioned topics and seeks to promote and publicize research undertaken by young researchers. PYRN membership is now up to 1100+ members with as many as 50 countries involved (11/07/2014). An Expression of Intent [http://www.ipy.org/development/eoi/details.php?id=1111]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} to the [[International Polar Year]] was submitted and PYRN will take part in this major event under the auspices of the International Permafrost Association.

The '''Pinsk Marshes''' ({{lang-be|Пінскія балоты}}, ''Pinskiya baloty''), also known as the '''Pripet Marshes''' ({{lang-be|Прыпяцкія балоты}}, ''Prypiackija baloty''), the '''Polesie Marshes''', and the '''Rokitno Marshes''', are a vast [[natural region]] of [[wetlands]] along the forested basin of the [[Pripyat River]] and its tributaries from [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] to the west to [[Mogilev]] to the northeast and [[Kiev]] to the southeast. It is one of the largest wetland areas of Europe. The city of [[Pinsk]] is one of the most important in the area.

==Overview==
The Pinsk Marshes mostly lie within the [[Polesian Lowland]], hence '''Polesie Marshes''' (Woodland Marshes), and occupy most of the southern part of [[Belarus]] and the north-west of [[Ukraine]]. They cover roughly {{convert|104000|sqmi|km2|-2}} surrounding the sandy lowlands of the dense network of rivers and rivulets forming on both sides of the Pripyat River, one of the main tributaries of the [[Dnieper]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/477144/Pripet-Marshes Pripet Marshes - Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; Dense woods are interspersed with numerous [[marshes]], [[Moorland|moors]], [[pond]]s and [[stream]]s extending {{convert|300|mi|km|-1}} west to east and {{convert|140|mi|km|0}} north to south. The marshes undergo substantial changes in size during the year, with melting snows in springtime and autumn [[rainfall]] causing extensive flooding as the river overflows. Drainage of the eastern portion began in 1870, and significant areas have been cleared for pasture and farmland.

==History==
Historically, for most of the year, the marshes were virtually impassable to major military forces, which influenced strategic planning of all military operations in the region. In Volume VII of ''Wars of Justitian'', by the Roman historian [[Procopius]], is a story that the early [[Slavs]] hid out from predators in the Pripet Marshes by breathing through reeds.

Like most other wetlands in Europe, the Pinsk Marshes were once seen as an unhealthy area and a focus of sickness. In the late 19th century, drainage of the marshes recovered 1.5 million hectares of wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;''Wetlands Under Threat.'' [[World Wide Fund For Nature]] Living Waters Campaign. [http://assets.panda.org/downloads/WETTHREATSENG.doc Issues Brief 1], p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of [[World War I]], the marshes separated the [[Austro-Hungarian Fourth Army]] from the XII corps; the few roads that traversed the region were narrow and largely unimproved. That  
left a wide gap, and the [[3rd Army Corps (Russian Empire)|Third Army Corps]] of the [[Imperial Russian Army]] poured in before the [[Austro-Hungarian Second Army]]'s transfer from [[Serbia]] was complete. The Russians soon captured the valuable railhead at Lemberg (now [[Lviv]]), then in the far east of [[Austria-Hungary]] (now part of the western [[Ukraine]]), as a result. Throughout the rest of the war, the wetlands remained one of the principal geographic obstacles of the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]].

The marshes divided the central and southern theatres of operation during [[World War II]], and they served as a hideout for both [[Soviet partisans|Soviet]] and [[Home Army|Polish partisans]]. At one stage during the war, the German administration planned to drain the marshes, 'cleanse' them of their 'degenerate' inhabitants and repopulate the area with German colonists. [[Konrad Meyer]] was the leader in command of the 'Pripet plan'. [[Hitler]] scuttled the project late in 1941, as he believed that it might entail [[Dust Bowl]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Blackbourn|Blackbourn, David]], (2006). ''The Conquest of Nature: Water, Landscape and the Making of Modern Germany''. Jonathan Cape.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germany|German]] racial [[anthropologist]] [[Theodor Poesche]] had proposed, in the late 19th century, that the [[Aryan]] race evolved in the marshes because of the prevalence of albinism.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

In 1942, after an uprising, approximately 1,000 Jews escaped from the [[Łachwa Ghetto]], of whom about 600 were able to take refuge in the Pinsk Marshes.

Known as ''Pripjet-Sümpfe'' by the Germans, the wetlands were dreaded by the [[Wehrmacht]] troops. During the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]], the [[Third Reich]] armies skirted the wetlands, passing through the north or south of it. However, after the debacle of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in 1944, many retreating units such as the [[7th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|7th]], [[35th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|35th]], [[134th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|134th]] and [[292nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|292nd Infantry Division]]s had to cut across the marshy areas. They often needed to build tracks with logs over which they could pull light loads in horse-drawn vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks11/1100731h/V1_5/v3.html Pictorial History Of The Second World War; Volume III - Fighting on the Pripet Marshes]&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a plan to drain the wetlands during 1952, when the area of the marshes was under [[Soviet]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;Karakov, G. (George), ''1952 plan for the draining of the Pripet Marshes.'' New York, N.Y. : Research Program on the U.S.S.R., 1953 (OCoLC)623960881.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the region became world-famous because of the [[Chernobyl disaster]]; however, the Pripet Marshes should not be confused with the [[ghost town|ghost city]] of [[Prypiat, Ukraine|Pripyat]]. That ill-fated community within the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] is located {{convert|356|km|mi|abbr=on}} east-southeast of the geographic center of the Pinsk Marshes area.

The '''RRS ''John Biscoe''''' was a supply and research vessel used by the [[British Antarctic Survey]] between 1956 and 1991.

==History==
An earlier vessel, {{ship|RRS|John Biscoe|1944}} operated from 1947-56. Both were named after the [[English people|English]] explorer [[John Biscoe]], who discovered parts of [[Antarctica]] in the early 1830s.

''John Biscoe II'' was replaced by {{ship|RRS|James Clark Ross}} in 1991. After decommissioning, she was sold and eventually scrapped in 2004 under the name ''Fayza Express''.

==Command==
''Biscoe'''s first visit to [[Halley Research Station]], in 1959/60 was under the veteran captain, Bill Johnston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.smitha.demon.co.uk/zfids/1960/biscoe.htm| title=RRS John Biscoe at Halley Bay| publisher=Z-Fids| accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1975, joint [[Captain (nautical)|Masters]] of ''John Biscoe'' were Malcolm Phelps and Chris Elliott.&lt;ref name="mbe"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_bas/news/news_story.php?id=158| title=MBE for Captain Chris Elliott| publisher=[[British Antarctic Survey]]| accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Elliott had joined BAS as Third Officer on ''John Biscoe'' in 1967, becoming Second Officer in 1970. He established the successful Offshore Biological Programme cruises and helped superintend the building of replacement {{ship|RRS|James Clark Ross||2}}. Elliott was awarded the [[Polar Medal]] in 2004 and an [[MBE]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="mbe"/&gt; The sea passage between [[Adelaide Island]] and Jenny Island is named after Chris Elliott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/living_and_working/diaries/rrs_james_clark_ross/antarctic2002_2003/jrupdate12_29_elliott_passage.php| title=06 Apr - Elliott Passage| publisher=[[British Antarctic Survey]]| accessdate=5 May 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704160600/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/living_and_working/diaries/rrs_james_clark_ross/antarctic2002_2003/jrupdate12_29_elliott_passage.php| archivedate=4 July 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14261">'''Science by press conference''' (or '''science by press release''') is the practice by which scientists put an unusual focus on publicizing results of research in the [[Mass media|media]].&lt;ref name="techreview1989"&gt;Jerome F (1989). Science by press conference. ''[[Technology Review]]'' July 1989, No. 92, pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is usually used disparagingly.&lt;ref name="hall2004"&gt;Hall, Stephen S. (2004). ''Merchants of Immortality: Chasing the Dream of Human Life Extension.'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, {{ISBN|978-0-618-49221-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to associate the target with people promoting scientific "findings" of questionable scientific merit who turn to the media for attention when they are unlikely to win the approval of the professional scientific community.

Premature publicity violates a cultural value of most of the scientific community, which is that findings should be subjected to [[independent review]] with a "thorough examination by the scientific community" before they are widely publicized.&lt;ref name=EMBOreports/&gt; The standard practice is to publish a paper in a [[peer-review]]ed scientific journal. This idea has many merits, including that the scientific community has a responsibility to conduct itself in a deliberative, non-[[attention seeking]] way; and that its members should be oriented more towards the pursuit of insight than fame. Science by press conference in its most egregious forms can be undertaken on behalf of an individual researcher seeking fame, a corporation seeking to sway public opinion or investor perception, or a political or ideological movement.

== History of the term ==

The phrase was coined by Spyros Andreopoulos, a public affairs officer at [[Stanford University Medical School]], in a 1980 letter which appeared in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''.&lt;ref name="Andreopoulos1980"&gt;Andreopoulos Spyros  (March 27, 1980). Gene Cloning by Press Conference. ''[[N Engl J Med]]'' 1980; 302:743–746&lt;/ref&gt; Andreopoulos was commenting specifically on the publicity practices of [[biotechnology]] startups, including [[Biogen]] and [[Genentech]].&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite book |author=Hall, Stephen K. |title=Merchants of immortality: chasing the dream of human life extension |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-618-49221-6 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal in which it appeared had implemented a long-standing policy under editor [[Franz J. Ingelfinger]] which prohibited seeking publicity for research prior to its submission or publication, informally called the Ingelfinger Rule.&lt;ref name="angell1991"&gt;Angell, Marcia and Kassirer, Jerome P. (November 7, 1991). [http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199111073251910 The Ingelfinger Rule Revisited.] ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notable examples of science by press conference ===

* In 1989, chemists [[Stanley Pons]] and [[Martin Fleischmann]] held a press conference to claim they had successfully achieved [[cold fusion]].&lt;ref name=EMBOreports/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilford1989"&gt;Wilford, John Noble (April 24, 1989). [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0716FE38580C778EDDAD0894D1484D81 Fusion Furor: Science's Human Face.] ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; (Highlighting the complexity of defining the term, Pons and Fleischman technically had an accepted paper in press at a peer-reviewed journal at the time of their press conference, though that was not widely acknowledged at the time and the quality of the paper and its review were subsequently criticized.&lt;ref name="Lewenstein1992"&gt;Lewenstein, Bruce V. (1992). Cold Fusion and Hot History. Osiris, 2nd series, 7, 135–163.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* In 1998, [[Andrew Wakefield]] held a press conference to claim that the [[MMR vaccine]] caused [[autism]].&lt;ref name=EMBOreports/&gt; In January 2011, an article by [[Brian Deer]] and its accompanying editorial in ''[[BMJ]]'' identified Wakefield's work as an "elaborate fraud".&lt;ref name=WakefieldarticleBMJ&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2011 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c7452 |pages= c7452 |volume=  342|title= Wakefield's article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent |vauthors=Godlee F, Smith J, Marcovitch H |journal = [[BMJ]] |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full |pmid=21209060}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPRWakefield&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.npr.org/2011/01/05/132692497/journal-study-linking-vaccine-to-autism-was-fraud |publisher=NPR | agency= Associated Press |title= Study linking vaccine to autism was fraud  |date= 2011-01-05 |accessdate= 2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='discredited'&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article7012267.ece |title=Lancet journal retracts Andrew Wakefield MMR scare paper |author=Rose, David |date=2010-02-03 |work=Times Online |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nGfAGGJ9?url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article7012267.ece |archivedate=2010-02-03 |location=London |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2002, a group called [[Clonaid]] held a press conference to announce they had successfully achieved [[human cloning]].&lt;ref name=EMBOreports/&gt;
* In 2005, the European Ramazzini Foundation of Oncology and Environmental Sciences (ERF) reported their findings from testing [[aspartame]] on rats. Their studies were widely criticized and later discounted.&lt;ref name=Lofstedt&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lofstedt | first = Ragnar | authorlink = Ragnar Löfstedt | title = Risk communication, media amplification and the aspartame scare| journal = Risk Management | volume = 10  | issue = 4 | pages = 257–284 | date = Oct 2008 | doi = 10.1057/rm.2008.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September 2012, [[Gilles-Éric Séralini]] held a press conference to claim that [[genetically modified food]] caused terrible cancers in rats, on the eve of the publication of a scientific paper, a book publication, and a movie release, and in the runup to the vote on the GM food labeling initiative, [[California Proposition 37]].  As the [[Séralini affair]] unfolded, it was revealed that Séralini required journalists to sign [[confidentiality agreements]] in order to receive pre-prints of the paper, to prevent them from discussing the paper with independent scientists.&lt;ref name=ButlerNatureNews&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/490158a |title=Hyped GM maize study faces growing scrutiny |year=2012 |last1=Butler |first1=Declan |journal=Nature |volume=490 |issue=7419 |pages=158 |pmid=23060167|bibcode = 2012Natur.490..158B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The scientific paper was retracted in 2013.&lt;ref name=Elsevier2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Elsevier Announces Article Retraction from Journal Food and Chemical Toxicology|url=http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/elsevier-announces-article-retraction-from-journal-food-and-chemical-toxicology|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These cases became notorious examples of "science by press conference" precisely because they were widely reported in the press, but were later either rebuffed, debunked, or found to be outright fraud.

== Motivations ==
[[File:201609 KDGS nr28.jpg|thumb|Martina Franzen on a German congress of sociology, 2016]]
Competition for publicity, between scientific institutions or just individual researchers, is considered a driving force behind premature press conferences.&lt;ref name=Winsten&gt;{{cite journal |author=J A Winsten |title=Science and the media: the boundaries of truth |journal=[[Health Affairs]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=5–23 |year=1985 |month= |pmid= |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.4.1.5 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/4/1/5.citation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure to announce research findings quickly enough to "avoid losing credit" for any scientific advances may be enhanced by limited or highly competitive funding.&lt;ref name=Winsten/&gt;

Science by press conference does not have to involve a groundbreaking announcement. A manufacturer may desire to publicize results of research that suggest their product is safe. Science by press conference does not necessarily have to be directed at the general public. In some cases, it may be directed at a target market like opinion leaders, a specific industry, potential investors, or a specific group of consumers. [[Biotechnology]] companies, for example, have financial incentives to utilize premature press conferences to gain favorable media coverage.&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;&lt;ref name="angell1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Winsten/&gt;

In recent years, sociologists of science have recast discussion about "science by press conference". They point to the increasing presence of media conversation across all aspects of culture, and argue that science is subject to many of the same social forces as other aspects of culture. They have described the increased "medialization" of science, and suggest that both science and society are changed by this process.&lt;ref name="Rödder"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Simone |editor1-last=Rödder |editor2-first=Martina |editor2-last=Franzen |editor3-first=Peter |editor3-last=Weingart |title=The sciences' media connection : public communication and its repercussions |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht/New York |isbn=9789400720848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the phrase tends to criticize scientists involved in creating the publicity, it has also been used to assert that the media bear responsibility in many instances.&lt;ref name=EMBOreports&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moore Andrew | year = 2006 | title = Bad science in the headlines: Who takes responsibility when science is distorted in the mass media? | url = http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v7/n12/full/7400862.html | journal = [[EMBO Reports]] | volume = 7 | issue = 12| pages = 1193–1196 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400862 | pmc = 1794697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even well-intentioned scientists can sometimes unintentionally create truth-distorting media firestorms because of journalists' difficulty in remaining critical and balanced, the media's interest in controversy, and the general tendency of science reporting to focus on apparent "groundbreaking findings" rather than on the larger context of a research field. Further, when results are released with great fanfare and limited peer review, basic journalism skills require skepticism and further investigation; the fact that they often do not can be seen as a problem with the media as much as with scientists who seek to exploit their power.

A common example of science by press conference occurs when the media report that a certain product or activity affects health or safety. For instance, the media frequently report findings that a certain food causes or prevents a disease. These reports sometimes contradict earlier reports. In some cases, it is later learned that a group interested in influencing opinion had a hand in publicizing a specific report.

The phrase also condemns different behavior in different fields. For instance, scientists working in fields that put an emphasis on the value of fast dissemination of research, like [[HIV]] treatment research, often first and most visibly disseminate research results via conferences or talks rather than through printed publication. In these areas of science, printed publication occurs later in the process of dissemination of results than in some other fields. In the case of HIV, this is partly the result of [[AIDS]] [[activism]] in which people with AIDS and their allies criticized the slow pace of research. In particular, they characterized researchers who kept quiet before publication as being more interested in their careers than in the well-being of people with AIDS. On the other hand, over-hyped early findings can inspire activists' ire and even their direct and critical use of the phrase "science by press conference". [[AIDS denialist]] groups have claimed that press conferences announcing findings in HIV and [[AIDS]] research, particularly [[Robert Gallo]]'s April 23, 1984, announcement of the discovery of the probable AIDS virus, inhibited research into non-HIV etiologies of AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kalichman, Seth C. |title=Denying AIDS: Conspiracy Theories, Pseudoscience, and Human Tragedy |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-387-79475-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mtDBCDwxugC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=%22Science+by+press+conference%22+-wikipedia#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Science%20by%20press%20conference%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false |doi= |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, clinical trials and other kinds of important medical research may release preliminary results to the media before a journal article is printed. In this case, the justification can be that clinicians and patients will benefit from the information even knowing that the data are preliminary and require further review. For instance, researchers did not wait to publish journal articles about the [[SARS]] outbreak before notifying the media about many of their findings, for obvious reasons.

Another example might be the termination of a clinical trial because it has yielded early benefit. Publicizing this kind of result has obvious value; a delay of a few months might have terrible consequences when the results concern life-threatening conditions. On the other hand, the latter practice is especially vulnerable to abuse for self-serving ends and thus has drawn criticism similar to that implied by the phrase "science by press conference".&lt;ref name="pmid18165635"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilcox RA, Djulbegovic B, Moffitt HL, Guyatt GH, Montori VM |title=Randomized trials in oncology stopped early for benefit |journal=J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=18–9 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18165635 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2007.13.6259 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These examples illustrate that the derision in the term "science by press conference" does not necessarily reflect an absolute rule to publish before publicizing. Rather, it illustrates the value that publicity should be a byproduct of science rather than its objective.

In [[control system]]s, '''sliding mode control (SMC)''' is a  [[nonlinear control]] method that alters the [[dynamic system|dynamics]] of a [[nonlinear system]] by application of a [[discontinuous]] control signal (or more rigorously, a set-valued control signal) that forces the system to "slide" along a cross-section of the system's normal behavior. The [[state space (controls)|state]]-[[feedback]] control law is not a [[continuous function]] of time. Instead, it can switch from one continuous structure to another based on the current position in the state space. Hence, sliding mode control is a [[variable structure control]] method. The multiple control structures are designed so that trajectories always move toward an adjacent region with a different control structure, and so the ultimate trajectory will not exist entirely within one control structure. Instead, it will ''slide'' along the boundaries of the control structures.  The motion of the system as it slides along these boundaries is called a ''sliding mode''&lt;ref name="Zinober1990"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the geometrical [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] consisting of the boundaries is called the ''sliding (hyper)surface''. In the context of modern control theory, any [[variable structure system]], like a system under SMC, may be viewed as a special case of a [[hybrid system|hybrid dynamical system]] as the system both flows through a continuous state space but also moves through different discrete control modes.

==Introduction==
[[File:First order sliding mode control.svg|thumb|Figure&amp;nbsp;1: [[Phase plane]] trajectory of a system being stabilized by a sliding mode controller. After the initial reaching phase, the system states "slides" along the line &lt;math&gt;s=0&lt;/math&gt;. The particular &lt;math&gt;s=0&lt;/math&gt; surface is chosen because it has desirable reduced-order dynamics when constrained to it. In this case, the &lt;math&gt;s=x_1 +\dot{x}_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; surface corresponds to the first-order [[LTI system]] &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_1 = -x_1&lt;/math&gt;, which has an [[exponentially stable]] origin.]]

Figure&amp;nbsp;1 shows an example trajectory of a system under sliding mode control. The sliding surface is described by &lt;math&gt;s=0&lt;/math&gt;, and the sliding mode along the surface commences after the finite time when system trajectories have reached the surface. In the theoretical description of sliding modes, the system stays confined to the sliding surface and need only be viewed as sliding along the surface. However, real implementations of sliding mode control approximate this theoretical behavior with a high-frequency and generally non-deterministic switching control signal that causes the system to "chatter" in a tight neighborhood of the sliding surface. In fact, although the system is nonlinear in general, the idealized (i.e., non-chattering) behavior of the system in Figure&amp;nbsp;1 when confined to the &lt;math&gt;s=0&lt;/math&gt; surface is an [[LTI system]] with an [[exponentially stable]] origin.

Intuitively, sliding mode control uses practically infinite [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] to force the trajectories of a [[dynamic system]] to slide along the restricted sliding mode subspace. Trajectories from this reduced-order sliding mode have desirable properties (e.g., the system naturally slides along it until it comes to rest at a desired [[stationary point|equilibrium]]). The main strength of sliding mode control is its [[robust control|robustness]]. Because the control can be as simple as a switching between two states (e.g., "on"/"off" or "forward"/"reverse"), it need not be precise and will not be sensitive to parameter variations that enter into the control channel. Additionally, because the control law is not a [[continuous function]], the sliding mode can be reached in ''finite'' time (i.e., better than asymptotic behavior). Under certain common conditions, [[optimal control|optimality]] requires the use of [[bang–bang control]]; hence, sliding mode control describes the [[optimal control]]ler for a broad set of dynamic systems.

One application of sliding mode controller is the control of electric drives operated by switching power converters.&lt;ref name="Utkin93"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/41.184818|last=Utkin|first= Vadim I.|year=1993|title=Sliding Mode Control Design Principles and Applications to Electric Drives|journal=IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics|volume=40|issue=1|pages=23–36|publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|"Introduction"}} Because of the discontinuous operating mode of those converters, a discontinuous sliding mode controller is a natural implementation choice over continuous controllers that may need to be applied by means of [[pulse-width modulation]] or a similar technique&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Other pulse-type modulation techniques include [[delta-sigma modulation]].&lt;/ref&gt; of applying a continuous signal to an output that can only take discrete states. Sliding mode control has many applications in robotics. In particular, this control algorithm has been used for tracking control of unmanned surface vessels in simulated rough seas with high degree of success.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD1hxwupECs "Autonomous Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance of Unmanned Vessels in Simulated Rough Sea States - Villanova University"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahini2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mahini|year=2013|title=An experimental setup for autonomous operation of surface vessels in rough seas

Sliding mode control must be applied with more care than other forms of [[nonlinear control]] that have more moderate control action. In particular, because actuators have delays and other imperfections, the hard sliding-mode-control action can lead to chatter, energy loss, plant damage, and excitation of unmodeled dynamics.&lt;ref name="Khalil02"/&gt;{{rp|554&amp;ndash;556}} Continuous control design methods are not as susceptible to these problems and can be made to mimic sliding-mode controllers.&lt;ref name="Khalil02"/&gt;{{rp|556&amp;ndash;563}}

==Control scheme==
Consider a [[nonlinear system|nonlinear dynamical system]] described by

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t)=f(\mathbf{x},t) + B(\mathbf{x},t)\,\mathbf{u}(t)
&lt;/math&gt;
|  {{EquationRef|1}}}}
|}
where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(t) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}x_1(t)\\x_2(t)\\\vdots\\x_{n-1}(t)\\x_n(t)\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;
is an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional [[state space (controls)|state]] [[column vector|vector]] and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(t) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}u_1(t)\\u_2(t)\\\vdots\\u_{m-1}(t)\\u_m(t)\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;
is an {{mvar|m}}-dimensional input vector that will be used for state [[feedback]]. The [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B: \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}&lt;/math&gt; are assumed to be [[continuous function|continuous]] and sufficiently [[smooth function|smooth]] so that the [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]] can be used to guarantee that solution &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt; to Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|1}}) [[existence|exists]] and is [[unique (mathematics)|unique]].

A common task is to design a state-feedback [[control systems|control law]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}(t))&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., a mapping from current state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt; at time {{mvar|t}} to the input &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;) to [[Lyapunov stability|stabilize]] the [[dynamical system]] in Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|1}}) around the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = [0, 0, \ldots, 0]^\intercal&lt;/math&gt;. That is, under the control law, whenever the system is started away from the origin, it will return to it. For example, the component &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; of the state vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; may represent the difference some output is away from a known signal (e.g., a desirable sinusoidal signal); if the control &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; can ensure that &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; quickly returns to &lt;math&gt;x_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the output will track the desired sinusoid. In sliding-mode control, the designer knows that the system behaves desirably (e.g., it has a stable [[stationary point|equilibrium]]) provided that it is constrained to a subspace of its [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]]. Sliding mode control forces the system trajectories into this subspace and then holds them there so that they slide along it. This reduced-order subspace is referred to as a ''sliding (hyper)surface'', and when closed-loop feedback forces trajectories to slide along it, it is referred to as a ''sliding mode'' of the closed-loop system. Trajectories along this subspace can be likened to trajectories along eigenvectors (i.e., modes) of [[LTI system]]s; however, the sliding mode is enforced by creasing the vector field with high-gain feedback. Like a marble rolling along a crack, trajectories are confined to the sliding mode.

The sliding-mode control scheme involves
# Selection of a [[hypersurface]] or a manifold (i.e., the sliding surface) such that the system trajectory exhibits desirable behavior when confined to this manifold.
# Finding feedback gains so that the system trajectory intersects and stays on the manifold.
Because sliding mode control laws are not [[continuous function|continuous]], it has the ability to drive trajectories to the sliding mode in finite time (i.e., stability of the sliding surface is better than asymptotic). However, once the trajectories reach the sliding surface, the system takes on the character of the sliding mode (e.g., the origin &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; may only have asymptotic stability on this surface).

The sliding-mode designer picks a ''switching function'' &lt;math&gt;\sigma: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; that represents a kind of "distance" that the states &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; are away from a sliding surface.
* A state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; that is outside of this sliding surface has &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x}) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* A state that is on this sliding surface has &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
The sliding-mode-control law switches from one state to another based on the ''sign'' of this distance. So the sliding-mode control acts like a stiff pressure always pushing in the direction of the sliding mode where &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
Desirable &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt; trajectories will approach the sliding surface, and because the control law is not [[continuous function|continuous]] (i.e., it switches from one state to another as trajectories move across this surface), the surface is reached in finite time. Once a trajectory reaches the surface, it will slide along it and may, for example, move toward the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; origin. So the switching function is like a [[topographic map]] with a contour of constant height along which trajectories are forced to move.

The sliding (hyper)surface is of dimension &lt;math&gt;n \times m&lt;/math&gt; where {{mvar|n}} is the number of states in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and {{mvar|m}} is the number of input signals (i.e., control signals) in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;. For each control index &lt;math&gt;1 \leq k \leq m&lt;/math&gt;, there is an &lt;math&gt;n \times 1&lt;/math&gt; sliding surface given by
{| border="0" width="75%"
|-
| align="left" |
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\left\{
\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n : 
\sigma_k(\mathbf{x}) = 0
\right\}
&lt;/math&gt;
|  {{EquationRef|2}}}}
|}
The vital part of SMC design is to choose a control law so that the sliding mode (i.e., this surface given by &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;) exists and is  reachable along system trajectories. The principle of sliding mode control is to forcibly constrain the system, by suitable control strategy, to stay on the sliding surface on which the system will exhibit desirable features. When the system is constrained by the sliding control to stay on the sliding surface, the system dynamics are governed by reduced-order system obtained from Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|2}}).

To force the system states &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; to satisfy &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;, one must:
# Ensure that the system is capable of reaching &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; from any initial condition
# Having reached &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;, the control action is capable of maintaining the system at &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;

===Existence of closed-loop solutions===
Note that because the control law is not [[continuous function|continuous]], it is certainly not locally [[Lipschitz continuous]], and so existence and uniqueness of solutions to the [[Closed-loop transfer function|closed-loop system]] is ''not'' guaranteed by the [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]]. Thus the solutions are to be understood in the [[Aleksei Fedorovich Filippov|Filippov]] sense.&lt;ref name="Zinober1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Filippov88"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly speaking, the resulting closed-loop system moving along &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; is approximated by the smooth [[dynamic system|dynamics]] &lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0};&lt;/math&gt; however, this smooth behavior may not be truly realizable. Similarly, high-speed [[pulse-width modulation]] or [[delta-sigma modulation]] produces outputs that only assume two states, but the effective output swings through a continuous range of motion. These complications can be avoided by using a different [[nonlinear control]] design method that produces a continuous controller. In some cases, sliding-mode control designs can be approximated by other continuous control designs.&lt;ref name="Khalil02"/&gt;

==Theoretical foundation==
The following theorems form the foundation of variable structure control.

===Theorem 1: Existence of sliding mode===
Consider a [[Lyapunov function]] candidate
{| border="0" width="75%"
|-
| align="left" |
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
V(\sigma(\mathbf{x}))=\frac{1}{2}\sigma^\intercal(\mathbf{x})\sigma(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{2}\|\sigma(\mathbf{x})\|_2^2
&lt;/math&gt;
|  {{EquationRef|3}}}}
|}
where &lt;math&gt;\|\mathord{\cdot}\|&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euclidean norm]] (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\|\sigma(\mathbf{x})\|_2&lt;/math&gt; is the distance away from the sliding manifold where &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;). For the system given by Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|1}}) and the sliding surface given by Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|2}}), a sufficient condition for the existence of a sliding mode is that
:&lt;math&gt; \underbrace{ \overbrace{\sigma^\intercal}^{\tfrac{\partial V}{\partial \sigma}} \overbrace{\dot{\sigma}}^{\tfrac{\operatorname{d} \sigma}{\operatorname{d} t}} }_{\tfrac{\operatorname{d}V}{\operatorname{d}t}} &lt; 0 \qquad \text{(i.e., } \tfrac{\operatorname{d}V}{\operatorname{d}t} &lt; 0 \text{)} &lt;/math&gt;
in a [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of the surface given by &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x})=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Roughly speaking (i.e., for the [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] control case when &lt;math&gt;m=1&lt;/math&gt;), to achieve &lt;math&gt;\sigma^\intercal \dot{\sigma} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the feedback control law &lt;math&gt; u(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt; is picked so that &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; have opposite signs. That is,
* &lt;math&gt;u(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; makes &lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma}(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; negative when &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; is positive.
* &lt;math&gt;u(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; makes &lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma}(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; positive when &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; is negative.
Note that
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma} 
= \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \overbrace{\dot{\mathbf{x}}}^{\tfrac{\operatorname{d} \mathbf{x}}{\operatorname{d} t}}
= \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \overbrace{\left( f(\mathbf{x},t) + B(\mathbf{x},t) \mathbf{u} \right)}^{\dot{\mathbf{x}}}&lt;/math&gt;
and so the feedback control law &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; has a direct impact on &lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;.

====Reachability: Attaining sliding manifold in finite time====
To ensure that the sliding mode &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; is attained in finite time, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{d}V/{\operatorname{d}t}&lt;/math&gt; must be more strongly bounded away from zero. That is, if it vanishes too quickly, the attraction to the sliding mode will only be asymptotic. To ensure that the sliding mode is entered in finite time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sliding Mode Control in Engineering|last1=Perruquetti|first1=W.|last2=Barbot|first2=J.P.|publisher=Marcel Dekker Hardcover|year=2002|isbn=0-8247-0671-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\operatorname{d}V}{\operatorname{d}t} \leq -\mu (\sqrt{V})^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \alpha \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; are constants.

===== Explanation by comparison lemma =====
This condition ensures that for the neighborhood of the sliding mode &lt;math&gt;V \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\operatorname{d}V}{\operatorname{d}t} \leq -\mu (\sqrt{V})^{\alpha} \leq -\mu \sqrt{V}.&lt;/math&gt;
So, for &lt;math&gt;V \in (0,1]&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ 1 }{ \sqrt{V} } \frac{\operatorname{d}V}{\operatorname{d}t} \leq -\mu,&lt;/math&gt;
which, by the [[chain rule]] (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{d}W/{\operatorname{d}t}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;W \triangleq 2 \sqrt{V}&lt;/math&gt;), means
:&lt;math&gt;\mathord{\underbrace{D^+ \Bigl( \mathord{\underbrace{2 \mathord{\overbrace{\sqrt{V}}^{ {} \propto \|\sigma\|_2}}}_{W}} \Bigr)}_{D^+ W \, \triangleq \, \mathord{\text{Upper right-hand } \dot{W}}}} = \frac{ 1 }{ \sqrt{V} } \frac{\operatorname{d}V}{\operatorname{d}t} \leq -\mu&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;D^+&lt;/math&gt; is the [[upper right-hand derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;2 \sqrt{V}&lt;/math&gt; and the symbol &lt;math&gt;\propto&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]]. So, by comparison to the curve &lt;math&gt;z(t) = z_0 - \mu t&lt;/math&gt; which is represented by differential equation &lt;math&gt;\dot{z} = -\mu&lt;/math&gt; with initial condition &lt;math&gt;z(0)=z_0&lt;/math&gt;, it must be the case that &lt;math&gt;2 \sqrt{V(t)} \leq V_0 - \mu t&lt;/math&gt; for all {{mvar|t}}. Moreover, because &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{V} \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{V}&lt;/math&gt; must reach &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{V}=0&lt;/math&gt; in finite time, which means that {{mvar|V}} must reach &lt;math&gt;V=0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., the system enters the sliding mode) in finite time.&lt;ref name="Khalil02"&gt;{{Cite book

===== Consequences for sliding mode control =====
In the context of sliding mode control, this condition means that
:&lt;math&gt; \underbrace{ \overbrace{\sigma^\intercal}^{\tfrac{\partial V}{\partial \sigma}} \overbrace{\dot{\sigma}}^{\tfrac{\operatorname{d} \sigma}{\operatorname{d} t}} }_{\tfrac{\operatorname{d}V}{\operatorname{d}t}} \leq -\mu ( \mathord{\overbrace{\| \sigma \|_2}^{\sqrt{V}}} )^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\|\mathord{\cdot}\|&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euclidean norm]]. For the case when switching function &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is scalar valued, the sufficient condition becomes
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma \dot{\sigma} \leq -\mu |\sigma|^{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;.
Taking &lt;math&gt;\alpha =1&lt;/math&gt;, the scalar sufficient condition becomes
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) \dot{\sigma} \leq -\mu &lt;/math&gt;
which is equivalent to the condition that
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) \neq \operatorname{sgn}(\dot{\sigma})
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
|\dot{\sigma}| \geq \mu &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.
That is, the system should always be moving toward the switching surface &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and its speed &lt;math&gt;|\dot{\sigma}|&lt;/math&gt; toward the switching surface should have a non-zero lower bound. So, even though &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; may become vanishingly small as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; approaches the &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; surface, &lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; must always be bounded firmly away from zero. To ensure this condition, sliding mode controllers are discontinuous across the &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 0&lt;/math&gt; manifold; they ''switch'' from one non-zero value to another as trajectories cross the manifold.

===Theorem 2: Region of attraction===
For the system given by Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|1}}) and sliding surface given by Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|2}}), the subspace for which the &lt;math&gt;\{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n : \sigma(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{0} \}&lt;/math&gt; surface is reachable is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n : \sigma^\intercal(\mathbf{x})\dot{\sigma}(\mathbf{x}) &lt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;
That is, when initial conditions come entirely from this space, the Lyapunov function candidate &lt;math&gt;V(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Lyapunov function]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; trajectories are sure to move toward the sliding mode surface where &lt;math&gt;\sigma( \mathbf{x} ) = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, if the reachability conditions from Theorem 1 are satisfied, the sliding mode will enter the region where &lt;math&gt;\dot{V}&lt;/math&gt; is more strongly bounded away from zero in finite time. Hence, the sliding mode &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 0&lt;/math&gt; will be attained in finite time.

===Theorem 3: Sliding motion===
Let
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}} B(\mathbf{x},t) &lt;/math&gt;
be [[nonsingular]]. That is, the system has a kind of [[controllability]] that ensures that there is always a control that can move a trajectory to move closer to the sliding mode. Then, once the sliding mode where &lt;math&gt; \sigma(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt; is achieved, the system will stay on that sliding mode. Along sliding mode trajectories, &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; is constant, and so sliding mode trajectories are described by the differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;.
If an &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;-[[stationary point|equilibrium]] is [[Lyapunov stability|stable]] with respect to this differential equation, then the system will slide along the sliding mode surface toward the equilibrium.

The ''equivalent control law'' on the sliding mode can be found by solving
:&lt;math&gt; \dot\sigma(\mathbf{x})=0 &lt;/math&gt;
for the equivalent control law &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \overbrace{\left( f(\mathbf{x},t) + B(\mathbf{x},t) \mathbf{u} \right)}^{\dot{\mathbf{x}}} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;
and so the equivalent control
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = -\left( \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial \mathbf{x}} B(\mathbf{x},t) \right)^{-1} \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial \mathbf{x}} f(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt;
That is, even though the actual control &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is not [[continuous function|continuous]], the rapid switching across the sliding mode where &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; forces the system to ''act'' as if it were driven by this continuous control.

Likewise, the system trajectories on the sliding mode behave as if
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \overbrace{f(\mathbf{x},t) - B(\mathbf{x},t) \left( \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial \mathbf{x}} B(\mathbf{x},t) \right)^{-1} \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial \mathbf{x}} f(\mathbf{x},t)}^{f(\mathbf{x},t) + B(\mathbf{x},t) u} = f(\mathbf{x},t)\left( \mathbf{I} - B(\mathbf{x},t) \left( \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial \mathbf{x}} B(\mathbf{x},t) \right)^{-1} \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
The resulting system matches the sliding mode differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;
, the sliding mode surface &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;, and the trajectory conditions from the reaching phase now reduce to the above derived simpler condition. Hence, the system can be assumed to follow the simpler &lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma} = 0&lt;/math&gt; condition after some initial transient during the period while the system finds the sliding mode. The same motion is approximately maintained when the equality &lt;math&gt; \sigma(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt; only approximately holds.

It follows from these theorems that the sliding motion is invariant (i.e., insensitive) to sufficiently small disturbances entering the system through the control channel. That is, as long as the control is large enough to ensure that &lt;math&gt;\sigma^\intercal \dot{\sigma} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly bounded away from zero, the sliding mode will be maintained as if there was no disturbance. The invariance property of sliding mode control to certain disturbances and model uncertainties is its most attractive feature; it is strongly [[Robust control|robust]].

As discussed in an example below, a sliding mode control law can keep the constraint
:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x} + x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
in order to asymptotically stabilize any system of the form
:&lt;math&gt; \ddot{x}=a(t,x,\dot{x}) + u&lt;/math&gt;
when &lt;math&gt;a(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; has a finite upper bound. In this case, the sliding mode is where
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = -x&lt;/math&gt;
(i.e., where &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}+x=0&lt;/math&gt;). That is, when the system is constrained this way, it behaves like a simple [[BIBO stability|stable]] [[linear system]], and so it has a globally exponentially stable equilibrium at the &lt;math&gt;(x,\dot{x})=(0,0)&lt;/math&gt; origin.

==Control design examples==
* Consider a [[plant (control theory)|plant]] described by Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|1}}) with single input {{mvar|u}} (i.e., &lt;math&gt;m = 1&lt;/math&gt;). The switching function is ''picked'' to be the linear combination

:where the weight &lt;math&gt;s_i &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;. The sliding surface is the [[simplex]] where &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x})=0&lt;/math&gt;. When trajectories are forced to slide along this surface,
::&lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma}(\mathbf{x}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:and so
::&lt;math&gt;s_1 \dot{x}_1 + s_2 \dot{x}_2 + \cdots + s_{n-1} \dot{x}_{n-1} + s_n \dot{x}_n = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:which is a reduced-order system (i.e., the new system is of order &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; because the system is constrained to this &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional sliding mode simplex). This surface may have favorable properties (e.g., when the plant dynamics are forced to slide along this surface, they move toward the origin &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;). Taking the derivative of the [[Lyapunov function]] in Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|3}}), we have
::&lt;math&gt;
\dot{V}(\sigma(\mathbf{x}))
= \overbrace{\sigma(\mathbf{x})^{\text{T}}}^{\tfrac{\partial \sigma}{\partial \mathbf{x}}} \overbrace{\dot{\sigma}(\mathbf{x})}^{\tfrac{\operatorname{d} \sigma}{\operatorname{d} t}}&lt;/math&gt;
:To ensure &lt;math&gt;\dot{V} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the feedback control law &lt;math&gt;u(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; must be chosen so that
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\dot{\sigma} &lt; 0 &amp;\text{if } \sigma &gt; 0\\
\dot{\sigma} &gt; 0 &amp;\text{if } \sigma &lt; 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:Hence, the product &lt;math&gt;\sigma \dot{\sigma} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; because it is the product of a negative and a positive number. Note that

u^-(\mathbf{x}) &amp;\text{if } \sigma(\mathbf{x}) &lt; 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:where
:* &lt;math&gt;u^+(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; is some control (e.g., possibly extreme, like "on" or "forward") that ensures Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|5}}) (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;) is ''negative'' at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt;u^-(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; is some control (e.g., possibly extreme, like "off" or "reverse") that ensures Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|5}}) (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;) is ''positive'' at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;
:The resulting trajectory should move toward the sliding surface where &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x})=0&lt;/math&gt;. Because real systems have delay, sliding mode trajectories often ''chatter'' back and forth along this sliding surface (i.e., the true trajectory may not smoothly follow &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x})=0&lt;/math&gt;, but it will always return to the sliding mode after leaving it).

* Consider the [[dynamic system]]
::&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=a(t,x,\dot{x})+u&lt;/math&gt;
:which can be expressed in a 2-dimensional [[state space (controls)|state space]] (with &lt;math&gt;x_1 = x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2 = \dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;) as
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\dot{x}_1 = x_2\\
\dot{x}_2 = a(t,x_1,x_2) + u
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:Also assume that &lt;math&gt;\sup\{ |a(\cdot)| \} \leq k&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., &lt;math&gt;|a|&lt;/math&gt; has a finite upper bound {{mvar|k}} that is known). For this system, choose the switching function
::&lt;math&gt;\sigma(x_1,x_2)= x_1 + x_2 = x + \dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;
:By the previous example, we must choose the feedback control law &lt;math&gt;u(x,\dot{x})&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\sigma \dot{\sigma} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Here,
::&lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma} = \dot{x}_1 + \dot{x}_2 = \dot{x} + \ddot{x} = \dot{x}\,+\,\overbrace{a(t,x,\dot{x})+ u}^{\ddot{x}}&lt;/math&gt;
:* When &lt;math&gt;x + \dot{x} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., when &lt;math&gt;\sigma &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;), to make &lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the control law should be picked so that &lt;math&gt;u &gt; |\dot{x} + a(t,x,\dot{x})|&lt;/math&gt;
:* When &lt;math&gt;x + \dot{x} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., when &lt;math&gt;\sigma &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;), to make &lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the control law should be picked so that &lt;math&gt;u &lt; -|\dot{x} + a(t,x,\dot{x})|&lt;/math&gt;
:However, by the [[triangle inequality]],
::&lt;math&gt;|\dot{x}| + |a(t,x,\dot{x})| \geq |\dot{x} + a(t,x,\dot{x})|&lt;/math&gt;
:and by the assumption about &lt;math&gt;|a|&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;|\dot{x}| + k + 1 &gt; |\dot{x}| + |a(t,x,\dot{x})|&lt;/math&gt;
:So the system can be feedback stabilized (to return to the sliding mode) by means of the control law
::&lt;math&gt;u(x,\dot{x})
=
\begin{cases}
   |\dot{x}| + k + 1 &amp;\text{if } \underbrace{x + \dot{x}} &lt; 0,\\
   -\left(|\dot{x}| + k + 1\right) &amp;\text{if } \overbrace{x + \dot{x}}^{\sigma} &gt; 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:which can be expressed in [[closed-form expression|closed form]] as
::&lt;math&gt;u(x,\dot{x}) = -(|\dot{x}|+k+1) \underbrace{\operatorname{sgn}(\overbrace{\dot{x}+x}^{\sigma})}_{\text{(i.e., tests } \sigma &gt; 0 \text{)}}&lt;/math&gt;
:Assuming that the system trajectories are forced to move so that &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x})=0&lt;/math&gt;, then
::&lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = -x \qquad \text{(i.e., } \sigma(x,\dot{x}) = x + \dot{x} = 0 \text{)}&lt;/math&gt;
:So once the system reaches the sliding mode, the system's 2-dimensional dynamics behave like this 1-dimensional system, which has a globally exponentially stable [[stationary point|equilibrium]] at &lt;math&gt;(x,\dot{x})=(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Automated design solutions===
Although various theories exist for sliding mode control system design, there is a lack of a highly effective design methodology due to practical difficulties encountered in analytical and numerical methods. A reusable computing paradigm such as a [[genetic algorithm]] can, however, be utilized to transform a 'unsolvable problem' of optimal design into a practically solvable 'non-deterministic polynomial problem'. This results in computer-automated designs for sliding model control. &lt;ref name="GA_SMC96"&gt;

==Sliding mode observer==
Sliding mode control can be used in the design of [[state observer]]s. These non-linear high-gain observers have the ability to bring coordinates of the estimator error dynamics to zero in finite time. Additionally, switched-mode observers have attractive measurement noise resilience that is similar to a [[Kalman filter]].&lt;ref name="UtkinGS99"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sliding Mode Control in Electromechanical Systems|last1=Utkin|first1=Vadim|last2=Guldner|first2=Jürgen|last3=Shi|first3=Jingxin|year=1999|publisher=Taylor &amp;amp; Francis, Inc.|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=0-7484-0116-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drakunov83"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drakunov|first=S.V.|title=An adaptive quasioptimal filter with discontinuous parameters|journal=Automation and Remote Control|year=1983|volume=44|issue=9|pages=1167&amp;ndash;1175}}&lt;/ref&gt; For simplicity, the example here uses a traditional sliding mode modification of a [[Luenberger observer]] for an [[LTI system]]. In these sliding mode observers, the order of the observer dynamics are reduced by one when the system enters the sliding mode. In this particular example, the estimator error for a single estimated state is brought to zero in finite time, and after that time the other estimator errors decay exponentially to zero. However, as first described by Drakunov,&lt;ref name="Drakunov92"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sliding-Mode Observers Based on Equivalent Control Method|journal=Proceedings of the 31st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), |last=Drakunov|first=S.V.|year=1992|issue=Tucson, Arizona, 16–18 December|pages=2368–2370|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=371368&amp;isnumber=8509|isbn=0-7803-0872-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[State observer#Sliding mode observer|sliding mode observer for non-linear systems]] can be built that brings the estimation error for all estimated states to zero in a finite (and arbitrarily small) time.

Here, consider the LTI system
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = A \mathbf{x} + B \mathbf{u}\\
y = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; \end{bmatrix} \mathbf{x} = x_1 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
where state vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} \triangleq (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \triangleq (u_1, u_2, \dots, u_r) \in \mathbb{R}^r&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of inputs, and output {{mvar|y}} is a scalar equal to the first state of the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; state vector. Let
:&lt;math&gt;A \triangleq \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} &amp; A_{12} \\ A_{21} &amp; A_{22} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;a_{11}&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar representing the influence of the first state &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; on itself,
* &lt;math&gt;A_{21} \in \mathbb{R}^{(n-1)}&lt;/math&gt; is a column vector representing the influence of the other states on the first state,
* &lt;math&gt;A_{22} \in \mathbb{R}^{(n-1) \times (n-1)}&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix representing the influence of the other states on themselves, and
* &lt;math&gt;A_{12} \in \mathbb{R}^{1\times(n-1)}&lt;/math&gt; is a row vector corresponding to the influence of the first state on the other states.

The goal is to design a high-gain state observer that estimates the state vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; using only information from the measurement &lt;math&gt;y=x_1&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, let the vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{x}} = (\hat{x}_1,\hat{x}_2,\dots,\hat{x}_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; be the estimates of the {{mvar|n}} states. The observer takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\hat{\mathbf{x}}} = A \hat{\mathbf{x}} + B \mathbf{u} + L v(\hat{x}_1 - x_1)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v: \R \to \R&lt;/math&gt; is a nonlinear function of the error between estimated state &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_1&lt;/math&gt; and the output &lt;math&gt;y=x_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;L \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is an observer gain vector that serves a similar purpose as in the typical linear [[state observer|Luenberger observer]]. Likewise, let
:&lt;math&gt;L = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ L_{2} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;L_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{(n-1)}&lt;/math&gt; is a column vector. Additionally, let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e} = (e_1, e_2, \dots, e_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; be the state estimator error. That is, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e} = \hat{\mathbf{x}} - \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;. The error dynamics are then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{\mathbf{e}}
&amp;= \dot{\hat{\mathbf{x}}} - \dot{\mathbf{x}}\\
&amp;= A \hat{\mathbf{x}} + B \mathbf{u} + L v(\hat{x}_1 - x_1) 
 - A \mathbf{x} - B \mathbf{u}\\
&amp;= A (\hat{\mathbf{x}} - \mathbf{x}) + L v(\hat{x}_1 - x_1)\\
&amp;= A \mathbf{e} + L v(e_1)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;e_1 = \hat{x}_1 - x_1&lt;/math&gt; is the estimator error for the first state estimate. The nonlinear control law {{mvar|v}} can be designed to enforce the sliding manifold
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \hat{x}_1 - x_1&lt;/math&gt;
so that estimate &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_1&lt;/math&gt; tracks the real state &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; after some finite time (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_1 = x_1&lt;/math&gt;). Hence, the sliding mode control switching function
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(\hat{x}_1,\hat{x}) \triangleq e_1 = \hat{x}_1 - x_1.&lt;/math&gt;
To attain the sliding manifold, &lt;math&gt;\dot{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; must always have opposite signs (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\sigma \dot{\sigma} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; for [[almost everywhere|essentially]] all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;). However,
:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{\sigma} = \dot{e}_1
= a_{11} e_1 + A_{12} \mathbf{e}_2 - v( e_1 )
= a_{11} e_1 + A_{12} \mathbf{e}_2 - v( \sigma )
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_2 \triangleq (e_2, e_3, \ldots, e_n) \in \mathbb{R}^{(n-1)}&lt;/math&gt; is the collection of the estimator errors for all of the unmeasured states. To ensure that &lt;math&gt;\sigma \dot{\sigma} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, let
:&lt;math&gt;v( \sigma ) = M \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;M &gt; \max\{ |a_{11} e_1 + A_{12} \mathbf{e}_2| \}.&lt;/math&gt;
That is, positive constant {{mvar|M}} must be greater than a scaled version of the maximum possible estimator errors for the system (i.e., the initial errors, which are assumed to be bounded so that {{mvar|M}} can be picked large enough; al). If {{mvar|M}} is sufficiently large, it can be assumed that the system achieves &lt;math&gt;e_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_1 = x_1&lt;/math&gt;). Because &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; is constant (i.e., 0) along this manifold, &lt;math&gt;\dot{e}_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; as well. Hence, the discontinuous control &lt;math&gt;v(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; may be replaced with the equivalent continuous control &lt;math&gt;v_{\text{eq}}&lt;/math&gt; where
:&lt;math&gt;
0 = \dot{\sigma} = a_{11} \mathord{\overbrace{e_1}^{ {} = 0 }} + A_{12} \mathbf{e}_2 - \mathord{\overbrace{v_{\text{eq}}}^{v(\sigma)}}
= A_{12} \mathbf{e}_2 - v_{\text{eq}}.&lt;/math&gt;
So
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathord{\underbrace{v_{\text{eq}}}_{\text{scalar}}} = \mathord{\underbrace{A_{12}}_{1 \times (n-1) \atop \text{ vector}}} \mathord{\underbrace{\mathbf{e}_2}_{(n-1) \times 1 \atop \text{ vector}}}.
&lt;/math&gt;
This equivalent control &lt;math&gt;v_{\text{eq}}&lt;/math&gt; represents the contribution from the other &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt; states to the trajectory of the output state &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, the row &lt;math&gt;A_{12}&lt;/math&gt; acts like an output vector for the error subsystem

\mathord{\overbrace{

\mathbf{e}_2

L_2 A_{12} \mathbf{e}_2
= ( A_2 + L_2 A_{12} ) \mathbf{e}_2.
&lt;/math&gt;
So, to ensure the estimator error &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_2&lt;/math&gt; for the unmeasured states converges to zero, the &lt;math&gt;(n-1)\times 1&lt;/math&gt; vector &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; must be chosen so that the &lt;math&gt;(n-1)\times (n-1)&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;( A_2 + L_2 A_{12} )&lt;/math&gt; is [[Hurwitz matrix|Hurwitz]] (i.e., the real part of each of its [[eigenvalue]]s must be negative). Hence, provided that it is [[observable]], this &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_2&lt;/math&gt; system can be stabilized in exactly the same way as a typical linear [[state observer]] when &lt;math&gt;A_{12}&lt;/math&gt; is viewed as the output matrix (i.e., "{{mvar|C}}"). That is, the &lt;math&gt;v_{\text{eq}}&lt;/math&gt; equivalent control provides measurement information about the unmeasured states that can continually move their estimates asymptotically closer to them. Meanwhile, the discontinuous control &lt;math&gt;v = M \operatorname{sgn}( \hat{x}_1 - x )&lt;/math&gt; forces the estimate of the measured state to have zero error in finite time. Additionally, white zero-mean symmetric measurement noise (e.g., [[Normal distribution|Gaussian noise]]) only affects the switching frequency of the control {{mvar|v}}, and hence the noise will have little effect on the equivalent sliding mode control &lt;math&gt;v_{\text{eq}}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, the sliding mode observer has [[Kalman filter]]&amp;ndash;like features.&lt;ref name="Drakunov83"/&gt;

The final version of the observer is thus
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{\hat{\mathbf{x}}}
&amp;= A \hat{\mathbf{x}} + B \mathbf{u} + L M \operatorname{sgn}(\hat{x}_1 - x_1)\\
&amp;= A \hat{\mathbf{x}} + B \mathbf{u} + \begin{bmatrix} -1\\L_2 \end{bmatrix} M \operatorname{sgn}(\hat{x}_1 - x_1)\\
&amp;= A \hat{\mathbf{x}} + B \mathbf{u} + \begin{bmatrix} -M\\L_2 M\end{bmatrix} \operatorname{sgn}(\hat{x}_1 - x_1)\\
&amp;= A \hat{\mathbf{x}} + \begin{bmatrix} B &amp; \begin{bmatrix} -M\\L_2 M\end{bmatrix} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{u} \\ \operatorname{sgn}(\hat{x}_1 - x_1) \end{bmatrix}\\
&amp;= A_{\text{obs}} \hat{\mathbf{x}} + B_{\text{obs}} \mathbf{u}_{\text{obs}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;A_{\text{obs}} \triangleq A,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;B_{\text{obs}} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix} B &amp; \begin{bmatrix} -M\\L_2 M\end{bmatrix} \end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt;u_{\text{obs}} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{u} \\ \operatorname{sgn}(\hat{x}_1 - x_1) \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
That is, by augmenting the control vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; with the switching function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sgn}(\hat{x}_1-x_1)&lt;/math&gt;, the sliding mode observer can be implemented as an LTI system. That is, the discontinuous signal &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sgn}(\hat{x}_1-x_1)&lt;/math&gt; is viewed as a control ''input'' to the 2-input LTI system.

For simplicity, this example assumes that the sliding mode observer has access to a measurement of a single state (i.e., output &lt;math&gt;y=x_1&lt;/math&gt;). However, a similar procedure can be used to design a sliding mode observer for a vector of weighted combinations of states (i.e., when output &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y} = C \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; uses a generic matrix {{mvar|C}}). In each case, the sliding mode will be the manifold where the estimated output &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{y}}&lt;/math&gt; follows the measured output &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; with zero error (i.e., the manifold where &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathbf{x}) \triangleq \hat{\mathbf{y}} - \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;).

[[Image:Free body diagram2.svg|right|thumb|200px|Block on a ramp and corresponding [[free body diagram]] of the block showing the surface force from the ramp onto the bottom of the block and separated into two components, a [[normal force]] ''N'' and a [[friction]]al shear force ''f'', along with the [[body force]] of [[gravity]] ''mg'' acting at the [[center of mass]].]]

'''Surface force''' denoted ''f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[force]] that acts across an internal or external surface element in a material body. Surface force can be decomposed into two perpendicular components: [[normal force]]s and [[shear force]]s. A normal force acts [[Normal (geometry)|normally]] over an area and a shear force acts [[tangent]]ially over an area.

== Equations for surface force ==

=== Surface force due to pressure ===
: &lt;math&gt; f_s=p \cdot A  \ &lt;/math&gt;, where ''f'' = force, ''p'' = pressure, and ''A'' = area on which a uniform pressure acts

== Examples ==

=== Pressure related surface force ===

Since pressure is &lt;math&gt; \frac{force}{area}=\mathrm{\frac{N}{m^2}} &lt;/math&gt;, and area is a &lt;math&gt; (length)\cdot(width) = \mathrm{m \cdot m }= \mathrm{m^2} &lt;/math&gt;,

:a pressure of &lt;math&gt; 5\ \mathrm{\frac{N}{m^2}} = 5\ \mathrm{Pa} &lt;/math&gt; over an area of &lt;math&gt; 20\ \mathrm{m^2} &lt;/math&gt; will produce a surface force of &lt;math&gt; (5\ \mathrm{Pa}) \cdot (20\ \mathrm{m^2}) = 100\  \mathrm{N} &lt;/math&gt;.

Systems engineering uses a host of tools that include [[modeling and simulation]], requirements analysis and scheduling to manage complexity.]]

'''Systems engineering''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field of [[engineering]] and [[engineering management]] that focuses on how to design and manage [[complex system]]s over their [[enterprise life cycle|life cycle]]s. At its core, systems engineering utilizes [[systems thinking]] principles to organize this body of knowledge. Issues such as [[requirements engineering]], reliability, [[logistics]], coordination of different teams, testing and evaluation, maintainability and many other [[Discipline (academia)|disciplines]] necessary for successful system development, design, implementation, and ultimate decommission become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects. Systems engineering deals with work-processes, optimization methods, and [[risk management]] tools in such projects. It overlaps technical and human-centered disciplines such as [[industrial engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[control engineering]], [[software engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[cybernetics]], [[organizational studies]], [[civil engineering]] and [[project management]]. Systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered, and integrated into a whole.

The systems engineering process is a discovery process that is quite unlike a manufacturing process. A manufacturing process is focused on repetitive activities that achieve high quality outputs with minimum cost and time. The systems engineering process must begin by discovering the real problems that need to be resolved, and identifying the most probable or highest impact failures that can occur –  systems engineering involves finding solutions to these problems.

==History==
[[Image:A1 House of Quality.png|left|thumb|QFD [[House of Quality]] for Enterprise Product Development Processes]]
The term ''systems engineering'' can be traced back to [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need to identify and manipulate the properties of a system as a whole, which in complex engineering projects may greatly differ from the sum of the parts' properties, motivated various industries, especially those developing systems for the U.S. Military, to apply the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was no longer possible to rely on design evolution to improve upon a system and the existing tools were not sufficient to meet growing demands, new methods began to be developed that addressed the complexity directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Systems Engineering | author = Andrew Patrick Sage | publisher=Wiley IEEE | year = 1992 | isbn= 0-471-53639-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continuing evolution of systems engineering comprises the development and identification of new methods and modeling techniques. These methods aid in a better comprehension of the design and developmental control of engineering systems as they grow more complex. Popular tools that are often used in the systems engineering context were developed during these times, including [[Universal Systems Language|USL]], [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], [[Quality function deployment|QFD]], and [[IDEF]]0.

In 1990, a professional society for systems engineering, the ''National Council on Systems Engineering'' (NCOSE), was founded by representatives from a number of U.S. corporations and organizations. NCOSE was created to address the need for improvements in systems engineering practices and education. As a result of growing involvement from systems engineers outside of the U.S., the name of the organization was changed to the [[International Council on Systems Engineering]] (INCOSE) in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[INCOSE]] Resp Group|url=http://www.incose.org/about/genesis.aspx|title=Genesis of INCOSE | accessdate = 2006-07-11 | date=11 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools in several countries offer graduate programs in systems engineering, and [[continuing education]] options are also available for practicing engineers.&lt;ref name="edu_dir"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[INCOSE]] Education &amp; Research Technical Committee|url=http://www.incose.org/educationcareers/academicprogramdirectory.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221040623/http://www.incose.org/educationcareers/academicprogramdirectory.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-02-21|title=Directory of Systems Engineering Academic Programs|accessdate=2006-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems engineering signifies only an approach and, more recently, a discipline in engineering. The aim of education in systems engineering is to formalize various approaches simply and in doing so, identify new methods and research opportunities similar to that which occurs in other fields of engineering. As an approach, systems engineering is holistic and interdisciplinary in flavour.

===Origins and traditional scope===
The traditional scope of engineering embraces the conception, design, development, production and operation of physical systems. Systems engineering, as originally conceived, falls within this scope. "Systems engineering", in this sense of the term, refers to the distinctive set of concepts, methodologies, organizational structures (and so on) that have been developed to meet the challenges of engineering effective functional systems of unprecedented size and complexity within time, budget, and other constraints. The [[Apollo program]] is a leading example of a systems engineering project.

===Evolution to broader scope===
The use of the term "systems engineer" has evolved over time to embrace a wider, more holistic concept of "systems" and of engineering processes. This evolution of the definition has been a subject of ongoing controversy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.86.7496&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=The Case for Evolving Systems Engineering as a Field within Engineering Systems|author1=Donna Rhodes |author2=Daniel Hastings|publisher=MIT Engineering Systems Symposium|date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term continues to apply to both the narrower and broader scope.

Traditional systems engineering was seen as a branch of engineering in the classical sense, that is, as applied only to physical systems, such as spacecraft and aircraft. More recently, systems engineering has evolved to a take on a broader meaning especially when humans were seen as an essential component of a system. Checkland, for example, captures the broader meaning of systems engineering by stating that 'engineering' "can be read in its general sense; you can engineer a meeting or a political agreement."&lt;ref name=Checkland&gt;{{cite book|author=Checkland, Peter|title=Systems Thinking, Systems Practice|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}

Consistent with the broader scope of systems engineering, the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Checkland, Peter|title=Systems Thinking, Systems Practice|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1999}} 
Pyster, Arthur, ed. 2012. Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge. 1.0 ed: Stephens Institute and the Naval Postgraduate School.&lt;/ref&gt; has defined three types of systems engineering: (1) Product Systems Engineering (PSE) is the traditional systems engineering focused on the design of physical systems consisting of hardware and software. (2) Enterprise Systems Engineering (ESE) pertains to the view of enterprises, that is, organizations or combinations of organizations, as systems. (3) Service Systems Engineering (SSE) has to do with the engineering of service systems. Checkland&lt;ref name=Checkland/&gt; defines a service system as a system which is conceived as serving another system. Most civil infrastructure systems are service systems.

===Holistic view===
Systems engineering focuses on analyzing and eliciting customer needs and required functionality early in the development cycle, documenting requirements, then proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem, the [[system lifecycle]]. This includes fully understanding all of the [[Project stakeholders|stakeholders]] involved. Oliver et al. claim that the systems engineering process can be decomposed into
* a ''Systems Engineering Technical Process'', and
* a ''Systems Engineering Management Process''.
Within Oliver's model, the goal of the Management Process is to organize the technical effort in the lifecycle, while the Technical Process includes ''assessing available information'', ''defining effectiveness measures'', to ''create a behavior model'', ''create a structure model'', ''perform trade-off analysis'', and ''create sequential build &amp; test plan''.&lt;ref name="Okk"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Oliver | first = David W. | authorlink = | author2 = Timothy P. Kelliher, James G. Keegan, Jr. | year = 1997 | title = Engineering Complex Systems with Models and Objects | publisher = McGraw-Hill | pages=85–94| isbn = 0-07-048188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on their application, although there are several models that are used in the industry, all of them aim to identify the relation between the various stages mentioned above and incorporate feedback. Examples of such models include the [[Waterfall model]] and the [[VEE model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gmu.edu/departments/seor/insert/robot/robot2.html | title = The SE VEE | publisher = SEOR, George Mason University | accessdate = 2007-05-26 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071018220159/http://www.gmu.edu/departments/seor/insert/robot/robot2.html | archivedate = 18 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interdisciplinary field===
System development often requires contribution from diverse technical disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Ramo|first = Simon|author2=Robin K. St.Clair |authorlink = Simon Ramo|title = The Systems Approach: Fresh Solutions to Complex Problems Through Combining Science and Practical Common Sense|year = 1998| location = Anaheim, CA | publisher = KNI, Inc.| url = http://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/DOC/SystemsApproach.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; By providing a systems ([[Holism|holistic]]) view of the development effort, systems engineering helps mold all the technical contributors into a unified team effort, forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation and, in some cases, to termination and disposal. In an acquisition, the holistic integrative discipline combines contributions and balances tradeoffs among cost, schedule, and performance while maintaining an acceptable level of risk covering the entire life cycle of the item.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| title = [[Defense Acquisition Guide]]book
| chapter = 4. Systems Engineering
| publisher = [[Defense Acquisition University]]
| accessdate = 2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This perspective is often replicated in educational programs, in that systems engineering courses are taught by faculty from other engineering departments, which helps create an interdisciplinary environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://systemseng.cornell.edu/people.html | title = Systems Engineering Program at Cornell University | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://esd.mit.edu/people/faculty.html | title= ESD Faculty and Teaching Staff | publisher = Engineering Systems Division, MIT | accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Managing complexity===
The need for systems engineering arose with the increase in complexity of systems and projects,&lt;ref&gt;Yassine, A. and Braha, D. (2003).

When speaking in this context, complexity incorporates not only engineering systems, but also the logical human organization of data. At the same time, a system can become more complex due to an increase in size as well as with an increase in the amount of data, variables, or the number of fields that are involved in the design. The [[International Space Station]] is an example of such a system.

[[File:STS-134 International Space Station after undocking.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[International Space Station]] is an example of a largely complex system requiring Systems Engineering.]]

The development of smarter control algorithms, microprocessor design, and analysis of environmental systems also come within the purview of systems engineering. Systems engineering encourages the use of tools and methods to better comprehend and manage complexity in systems. Some examples of these tools can be seen here:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://systemseng.cornell.edu/CourseList.html | title=Core Courses, Systems Analysis&amp;nbsp;– Architecture, Behavior and Optimization | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[System dynamics]]'',
* ''[[Systems analysis]]'',
* ''[[Statistical analysis]]'',
* ''[[Reliability engineering|Reliability analysis]]'', and
* ''[[Decision making]]''

Taking an [[interdisciplinary]] approach to engineering systems is inherently complex since the [[behavior]] of and interaction among system components is not always immediately [[well defined]] or understood. Defining and characterizing such [[system]]s and subsystems and the interactions among them is one of the goals of systems engineering. In doing so, the gap that exists between informal requirements from users, operators, marketing organizations, and technical specifications is successfully bridged.

===Scope===
[[Image:SE Activities.jpg|left|thumb|400px|The scope of systems engineering activities&lt;ref name="SEF01"&gt;[http://www.dau.mil/publications/publicationsDocs/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131231503/http://www.dau.mil/publications/publicationsdocs/sefguide%2001-01.pdf |date=31 January 2017 }} Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;]]
One way to understand the motivation behind systems engineering is to see it as a method, or practice, to identify and improve common rules that exist within a wide variety of systems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIXP-3VhztgC&amp;pg=PA492&amp;lpg=PA492&amp;dq=One+way+to+understand+the+motivation+behind+systems+engineering+is+to+see+it+as+a+method,+or+practice,+to+identify+and+improve+common+rules+that+exist+within+a+wide+variety+of+systems.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=g-qkKHewbh&amp;sig=i52JJqPEkh5acuo_0CWhNGrYKBg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU0deQmLjSAhVH1CYKHZYnAGsQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%20%22understand%20the%20motivation%20behind%20systems%20engineering%20is%20to%20see%20it%20as%20a%20method,%20or%20practice,%20to%20identify%20and%20improve%20common%20rules%20that%20exist%20within%20a%20wide%20variety%20of%20systems.%22&amp;f=false|title=Complexity and Dynamics|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping this in mind, the principles of systems engineering&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; holism, emergent behavior, boundary, et al.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; can be applied to any system, complex or otherwise, provided [[systems thinking]] is employed at all levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://incose.org.uk/Downloads/AA01.1.4_Principles%20&amp;%20practices%20of%20SE.pdf | format = PDF | title = Principles and Practices of Systems Engineering | author = Rick Adcock | publisher = INCOSE, UK | accessdate = 2007-06-07 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070615160805/http://incose.org.uk/Downloads/AA01.1.4_Principles%20%26%20practices%20of%20SE.pdf | archivedate = 15 June 2007 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides defense and aerospace, many information and technology based companies, software development firms, and industries in the field of electronics &amp; communications require systems engineers as part of their team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gmu.edu/departments/seor/insert/intro/introsal.html | title=Systems Engineering, Career Opportunities and Salary Information (1994) | publisher=George Mason University | accessdate=2007-06-07 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922213853/http://www.gmu.edu/departments/seor/insert/intro/introsal.html | archivedate=22 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis by the INCOSE Systems Engineering center of excellence (SECOE) indicates that optimal effort spent on systems engineering is about 15-20% of the total project effort.&lt;ref name="SEvalue"/&gt; At the same time, studies have shown that systems engineering essentially leads to reduction in costs among other benefits.&lt;ref name="SEvalue"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.incose.org/secoe/0103/ValueSE-INCOSE04.pdf |format=PDF| title=Understanding the Value of Systems Engineering | accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no quantitative survey at a larger scale encompassing a wide variety of industries has been conducted until recently.

Systems engineering encourages the use of [[modeling and simulation]] to validate assumptions or theories on systems and the interactions within them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1177/003754970107600207| author = [[Andrew P.

Use of methods that allow early detection of possible failures, in [[safety engineering]], are integrated into the design process. At the same time, decisions made at the beginning of a project whose consequences are not clearly understood can have enormous implications later in the life of a system, and it is the task of the modern systems engineer to explore these issues and make critical decisions. No method guarantees today's decisions will still be valid when a system goes into service years or decades after first conceived. However, there are techniques that support the process of systems engineering. Examples include soft systems methodology, [[Jay Wright Forrester]]'s [[System dynamics]] method, and the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML)—all currently being explored, evaluated, and developed to support the engineering decision process.

==Education==
{{Main article|List of systems engineering at universities}}
Education in systems engineering is often seen as an extension to the regular engineering courses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gaudisite.nl/DidacticRecommendationsSESlides.pdf |format=PDF| title=Didactic Recommendations for Education in Systems Engineering | accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the industry attitude that engineering students need a foundational background in one of the traditional engineering disciplines (e.g., [[aerospace engineering]], [[civil engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[industrial engineering]])—plus practical, real-world experience to be effective as systems engineers. Undergraduate university programs in systems engineering are rare. Typically, systems engineering is offered at the graduate level in combination with interdisciplinary study.

[[INCOSE]] maintains a continuously updated Directory of Systems Engineering Academic Programs worldwide.&lt;ref name="edu_dir"/&gt; As of 2009, there are about 80 institutions in United States that offer 165 undergraduate and graduate programs in systems engineering. Education in systems engineering can be taken as ''Systems-centric'' or ''Domain-centric''.
* ''Systems-centric'' programs treat systems engineering as a separate discipline and most of the courses are taught focusing on systems engineering principles and practice.
* ''Domain-centric'' programs offer systems engineering as an option that can be exercised with another major field in engineering.
Both of these patterns strive to educate the systems engineer who is able to oversee interdisciplinary projects with the depth required of a core-engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://sistemas.unmsm.edu.pe/occa/material/INCOSE-ABET-SE-SF-21Mar06.pdf |format=PDF| title = Perspectives of Systems Engineering Accreditation | publisher= [[INCOSE]] | accessdate=2007-06-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070615160805/http://sistemas.unmsm.edu.pe/occa/material/INCOSE-ABET-SE-SF-21Mar06.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 15 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems engineering topics==
Systems engineering tools are [[strategy|strategies]], [[Procedure (term)|procedures]], and [[wikt:technique|techniques]] that aid in performing systems engineering on a [[project]] or [[Product (business)|product]]. The purpose of these tools vary from database management, graphical browsing, simulation, and reasoning, to document production, neutral import/export and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marc.gatech.edu/events/pde2005/presentations/0.2-jenkins.pdf|format=PDF|title=A Future for Systems Engineering Tools|author=Steven Jenkins|publisher=NASA|page=15|accessdate=2007-06-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926044858/http://www.marc.gatech.edu/events/pde2005/presentations/0.2-jenkins.pdf|archivedate=26 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===System===
There are many definitions of what a [[system]] is in the field of systems engineering. Below are a few authoritative definitions:

* [[ANSI]]/[[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]]-632-1999: "An aggregation of end products and enabling products to achieve a given purpose."&lt;ref&gt;"Processes for Engineering a System", ANSI/EIA-632-1999, [[ANSI]]/[[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]], 1999 [https://web.archive.org/web/20100705203209/http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ANSI%2fEIA-632-1999]&lt;/ref&gt;
* DAU Systems Engineering Fundamentals: "an integrated composite of people, products, and processes that provide a capability to satisfy a stated need or objective."
* [[IEEE]] Std 1220-1998: "A set or arrangement of elements and processes that are related and whose behavior satisfies customer/operational needs and provides for life cycle sustainment of the products."&lt;ref&gt;"Standard for Application and Management of the Systems Engineering Process -Description", IEEE Std 1220-1998, [[IEEE]], 1998 [http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/se/1220-1998_desc.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International Council on Systems Engineering|INCOSE]] Systems Engineering Handbook: "homogeneous entity that exhibits predefined behavior in the real world and is composed of heterogeneous parts that do not individually exhibit that behavior and an integrated configuration of components and/or subsystems."&lt;ref&gt;"Systems Engineering Handbook", v3.1, [[International Council on Systems Engineering|INCOSE]], 2007 [http://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/products/sehandbook.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International Council on Systems Engineering|INCOSE]]: "A system is a construct or collection of different elements that together produce results not obtainable by the elements alone. The elements, or parts, can include people, hardware, software, facilities, policies, and documents; that is, all things required to produce systems-level results. The results include system level qualities, properties, characteristics, functions, behavior and performance. The value added by the system as a whole, beyond that contributed independently by the parts, is primarily created by the relationship among the parts; that is, how they are interconnected."&lt;ref&gt;"A Consensus of the INCOSE Fellows", [[International Council on Systems Engineering|INCOSE]], 2006 [http://www.incose.org/practice/fellowsconsensus.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ISO/IEC]] 15288:2008: "A combination of interacting elements organized to achieve one or more stated purposes."&lt;ref&gt;"Systems and software engineering&amp;nbsp;– System life cycle processes", ISO/IEC 15288:2008, [[ISO/IEC]], 2008 [http://www.15288.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[NASA]] Systems Engineering Handbook: "(1) The combination of elements that function together to produce the capability to meet a need. The elements include all hardware, software, equipment, facilities, personnel, processes, and procedures needed for this purpose.

===The systems engineering process===
The systems engineering process encompasses all creative, manual and technical activities necessary to define the product and which need to be carried out to convert a system definition to a sufficiently detailed system design specification for product manufacture and deployment. Design and development of a system can be divided into four stages, each with different definitions:&lt;ref name="lienig"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-55840-0|pp=6-7|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* task definition (informative definition),
* conceptual stage (cardinal definition),
* design stage (formative definition), and
* implementation stage (manufacturing definition).

Depending on their application, tools are used for various stages of the systems engineering process:&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt;
:[[Image:Systems Engineering Process.jpg|600px|center]]

===Using models===
[[Abstract model|Model]]s play important and diverse roles in systems engineering. A model can be defined in several
ways, including:&lt;ref name="NASA95"&gt;NASA (1995). "System Analysis and Modeling Issues". In: '' [http://human.space.edu/old/docs/Systems_Eng_Handbook.pdf NASA Systems Engineering Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217005338/http://human.space.edu/old/docs/Systems_Eng_Handbook.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }}'' June 1995. p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;
* An abstraction of reality designed to answer specific questions about the real world
* An imitation, analogue, or representation of a real world process or structure; or
* A conceptual, mathematical, or physical tool to assist a decision maker.
Together, these definitions are broad enough to encompass physical engineering models used in the verification of a system design, as well as schematic models like a [[functional flow block diagram]] and mathematical (i.e., quantitative) models used in the trade study process. This section focuses on the last.&lt;ref name="NASA95"/&gt;

The main reason for using [[mathematical model]]s and [[mathematical diagram|diagrams]] in trade studies is to provide estimates of system effectiveness, performance or technical attributes, and cost from a set of known or estimable quantities. Typically, a collection of separate models is needed to provide all of these outcome variables. The heart of any mathematical model is a set of meaningful quantitative relationships among its inputs and outputs. These relationships can be as simple as adding up constituent quantities to obtain a total, or as complex as a set of differential equations describing the trajectory of a spacecraft in a gravitational field. Ideally, the relationships express causality, not just correlation.&lt;ref name="NASA95"/&gt; Furthermore, key to successful systems engineering activities are also the methods with which these models are efficiently and effectively managed and used to simulate the systems. However, diverse domains often present recurring problems of modeling and simulation for systems engineering, and new advancements are aiming to crossfertilize methods among distinct scientific and engineering communities, under the title of 'Modeling &amp; Simulation-based Systems Engineering'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gianni|editor1-first=Daniele|editor2-last=D'Ambrogio|editor2-first=Andrea|editor3-last=Tolk|editor3-first=Andreas|title=Modeling and Simulation-Based Systems Engineering Handbook|date=4 December 2014|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781466571457|pages=513|edition=1st|url=http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781466571457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modeling formalisms and graphical representations===
Initially, when the primary purpose of a systems engineer is to comprehend a complex problem, graphic representations of a system are used to communicate a system's functional and data requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.vitechcorp.com/resources/technical_papers/200701031634430.CommonGraphicalRepresentations_2002.pdf |format=PDF| title = Relationships between Common Graphical Representations in System Engineering | last=Long | first=Jim| publisher=[[Vitech Corporation]] | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common graphical representations include:
* [[Functional flow block diagram]] (FFBD)
* [[Model-based design]]
* [[Data flow diagram]] (DFD)
* [[N2 chart]]
* [[IDEF0|IDEF0 diagram]]
* [[Use case|Use case diagram]]
* [[Sequence diagram]]
* [[Block diagram]]
* [[Signal-flow graph]]
* [[Universal Systems Language#Formalism for a theory of control|USL function maps and type maps]]
* [[Enterprise architecture framework]]s
* [[Model-based systems engineering]]

A graphical representation relates the various subsystems or parts of a system through functions, data, or interfaces. Any or each of the above methods are used in an industry based on its requirements. For instance, the N2 chart may be used where interfaces between systems is important. Part of the design phase is to create structural and behavioral models of the system.

Once the requirements are understood, it is now the responsibility of a systems engineer to refine them, and to determine, along with other engineers, the best technology for a job. At this point starting with a trade study, systems engineering encourages the use of weighted choices to determine the best option. A [[decision matrix]], or Pugh method, is one way ([[Quality function deployment|QFD]] is another) to make this choice while considering all criteria that are important. The trade study in turn informs the design, which again affects graphic representations of the system (without changing the requirements). In an SE process, this stage represents the iterative step that is carried out until a feasible solution is found. A decision matrix is often populated using techniques such as statistical analysis, reliability analysis, system dynamics (feedback control), and optimization methods.

===Other tools===
[[Systems Modeling Language]] (SysML), a modeling language used for systems engineering applications, supports the specification, analysis, design, verification and validation of a broad range of complex systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sysml.org/docs/specs/OMGSysML-FAS-06-05-04.pdf |format=PDF| title = OMG SysML Specification |page = 23 | publisher=SysML Open Source Specification Project | accessdate=2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lifecycle Modeling Language]] (LML), is an open-standard modeling language designed for systems engineering that supports the full lifecycle: conceptual, utilization, support and retirement stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.lifecyclemodeling.org/spec/LML_Specification_1_0.pdf |format=PDF | title = LML Specification |page = 4 | publisher=LML Steering Committee | accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields and sub-fields==
Many related fields may be considered tightly coupled to systems engineering. The following areas have contributed to the development of systems engineering as a distinct entity:
;Cognitive systems engineering
:Cognitive systems engineering (CSE) is a specific approach to the description and analysis of human-machine systems or [[sociotechnical systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollnagel E. &amp; Woods D. D. (1983). Cognitive systems engineering: New wine in new bottles. International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, 18, 583-600.&lt;/ref&gt; The three main themes of CSE are how humans cope with complexity, how work is accomplished by the use of artifacts, and how human-machine systems and socio-technical systems can be described as joint cognitive systems. CSE has since its beginning become a recognized scientific discipline, sometimes also referred to as [[cognitive engineering]]. The concept of a Joint Cognitive System (JCS) has in particular become widely used as a way of understanding how complex socio-technical systems can be described with varying degrees of resolution. The more than 20 years of experience with CSE has been described extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Hollnagel, E. &amp; Woods, D. D. (2005) Joint cognitive systems: The foundations of cognitive systems engineering. Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woods, D. D. &amp; Hollnagel, E. (2006). Joint cognitive systems: Patterns in cognitive systems engineering. Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Configuration management
:Like systems engineering, [[configuration management]] as practiced in the [[defence industry|defense]] and [[aerospace industry]] is a broad systems-level practice.  The field parallels the taskings of systems engineering; where systems engineering deals with requirements development, allocation to development items and verification, configuration management deals with requirements capture, traceability to the development item, and audit of development item to ensure that it has achieved the desired functionality that systems engineering and/or Test and Verification Engineering have proven out through objective testing.
;Control engineering
:[[Control engineering]] and its design and implementation of [[control systems]], used extensively in nearly every industry, is a large sub-field of systems engineering. The cruise control on an automobile and the guidance system for a ballistic missile are two examples. Control systems theory is an active field of applied mathematics involving the investigation of solution spaces and the development of new methods for the analysis of the control process.
;Industrial engineering
:[[Industrial engineering]] is a branch of [[engineering]] that concerns the development, improvement, implementation and evaluation of integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, material and process. Industrial engineering draws upon the principles and methods of engineering analysis and synthesis, as well as mathematical, physical and social sciences together with the principles and methods of engineering analysis and design to specify, predict, and evaluate results obtained from such systems.
;Interface design
:[[Interface design]] and its specification are concerned with assuring that the pieces of a system connect and inter-operate with other parts of the system and with external systems as necessary. Interface design also includes assuring that system interfaces be able to accept new features, including mechanical, electrical and logical interfaces, including reserved wires, plug-space, command codes and bits in communication protocols.  This is known as [[extensibility]]. [[Human-Computer Interaction]] (HCI) or Human-Machine Interface (HMI) is another aspect of interface design, and is a critical aspect of modern systems engineering. Systems engineering principles are applied in the [[network protocol design principles|design of network protocols]] for [[local-area networks]] and [[wide-area networks]].
;Mechatronic engineering
:[[Mechatronic engineering]], like systems engineering, is a multidisciplinary field of engineering that uses dynamical systems modeling to express tangible constructs. In that regard it is almost indistinguishable from Systems Engineering, but what sets it apart is the focus on smaller details rather than larger generalizations and relationships. As such, both fields are distinguished by the scope of their projects rather than the methodology of their practice.
;Operations research
:[[Operations research]] supports systems engineering. The tools of operations research are used in systems analysis, decision making, and trade studies. Several [[List of systems engineering at universities|schools teach SE courses]] within the [[operations research]] or [[industrial engineering]] department,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; highlighting the role systems engineering plays in complex projects. [[Operations research]], briefly, is concerned with the optimization of a process under multiple constraints.&lt;ref&gt;(see articles for discussion: [http://www.boston.com/globe/search/stories/reprints/operationeverything062704.html] and {{cite web |url=http://www.sas.com/news/sascom/2004q4/feature_tech.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050920174512/http://www.sas.com/news/sascom/2004q4/feature_tech.html |archivedate=20 September 2005 |df=dmy-all }})&lt;/ref&gt;
;Performance engineering
:[[Performance engineering]] is the discipline of ensuring a system meets customer expectations for performance throughout its life. Performance is usually defined as the speed with which a certain operation is executed, or the capability of executing a number of such operations in a unit of time. Performance may be degraded when operations queued to execute is throttled by limited system capacity. For example, the performance of a [[packet-switched network]] is characterized by the end-to-end packet transit delay, or the number of packets switched in an hour. The design of high-performance systems uses analytical or simulation modeling, whereas the delivery of high-performance implementation involves thorough performance testing. Performance engineering relies heavily on [[statistics]], [[queueing theory]] and [[probability theory]] for its tools and processes.
;Program management and project management
:[[Program management]] (or programme management) has many similarities with systems engineering, but has broader-based origins than the engineering ones of systems engineering.  [[Project management]] is also closely related to both program management and systems engineering.
;Proposal engineering
:Proposal engineering is the application of scientific and mathematical principles to design, construct, and operate a cost-effective proposal development system. Basically, proposal engineering uses the "[[systems engineering process]]" to create a cost effective proposal and increase the odds of a successful proposal.
;Reliability engineering
:[[Reliability engineering]] is the discipline of ensuring a system meets customer expectations for reliability throughout its life; i.e., it does not fail more frequently than expected. Next to prediction of failure, it is just as much about prevention of failure. Reliability engineering applies to all aspects of the system. It is closely associated with [[maintainability]], [[availability]] ([[dependability]] or [[RAMS]] preferred by some), and [[logistic engineering|logistics engineering]]. Reliability engineering is always a critical component of safety engineering, as in [[Failure mode and effects analysis|failure modes and effects analysis]] (FMEA) and [[fault tree|hazard fault tree]] analysis, and of [[security engineering]].
;Risk Management
:[[Risk Management]], the practice of assessing and dealing with [[risk]] is one of the interdisciplinary parts of Systems Engineering. In development, acquisition, or operational activities, the inclusion of risk in tradeoff with cost, schedule, and performance features, involves the iterative complex configuration management of traceability and evaluation to the scheduling and requirements management across domains and for the [[system lifecycle]] that requires the interdisciplinary technical approach of systems engineering. Systems Engineering has Risk Management define, tailor, implement, and monitor a structured process for risk management which is integrated to the overall effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www2.mitre.org/work/sepo/toolkits/risk/index.html
|title = Risk Management Toolkit
|publisher = MITRE, SE Process Office
|accessdate = 8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Safety engineering
:The techniques of [[safety engineering]] may be applied by non-specialist engineers in designing complex systems to minimize the probability of safety-critical failures. The "System Safety Engineering" function helps to identify "safety hazards" in emerging designs, and may assist with techniques to "mitigate" the effects of (potentially) hazardous conditions that cannot be designed out of systems.
;Scheduling
: [[Schedule (project management)|Scheduling]] is one of the systems engineering support tools as a practice and item in assessing interdisciplinary concerns under configuration management.  In particular the direct relationship of resources, performance features, and risk to duration of a task or the dependency links among tasks and impacts across the [[system lifecycle]] are systems engineering concerns.
;Security engineering
: [[Security engineering]] can be viewed as an [[interdisciplinary]] field that integrates the [[community of practice]] for control systems design, reliability, safety and systems engineering.  It may involve such sub-specialties as [[authentication]] of system users, system targets and others: people, objects and processes.
;Software engineering
:From its beginnings, [[software engineering]] has helped shape modern systems engineering practice. The techniques used in the handling of the complexities of large software-intensive systems have had a major effect on the shaping and reshaping of the tools, methods and processes of Software Engineering.

'''Tela Botanica''' is a collaborative network of francophone botanists, 80% of whom live in France (about 28 000 enrolled at the end of 2016).
It served as a model for the network of entomologists Tela Insecta, which is developing in partnership with Tela Botanica.

== Context ==
Given the growing importance of the issues related to the protection of the planet's resources and the need for their sustainable exploitation, it is important that botany finds a preponderant place at the crossroads of the many disciplines that deal with knowledge of plants and the world vegetal: floristics, systematics, taxonomy, phytosociology, phytogeography, chorology, plant ecology, ethnobotany, etc.

The Tela Botanica network was created with the aim of supporting this renewal of botany in the French-speaking world.

== History ==
The Tela Botanica network was created and is managed by an association of 1901 law: Association Tela Botanica. This association deposited its statutes on 14 December 1999 in the department of Hérault. Its founding members include three legal entities (the Société botanique de France, the Travel Guardian and ACEMAV) and the initiator of the project is Daniel Mathieu.

The headquarters of the association is located at the Institute of Botany of Montpellier (University Montpellier 2). In four years, the network doubled its number of registrants, whereas it took seven years to reach the ten thousandth registrant. The 20,000th member joined the association on April 22, 2013. By 2014, the network has approximately 24,000 registered members and approximately 13,000 pages of the site are accessed daily.

== Aims ==
Its main objectives are:
* to create links between francophone botanists;
* to set up collective projects;
* to collect data to make available to botanists;
* to bring together the initiatives that contribute to the development of botany, including "digital botany".

== Operation ==
The Tela Botanica network is aimed at all persons, whether natural or legal, interested in the knowledge and protection of the plant world, in an ethic of respect for nature, man and his environment.
Its operation is based on two essential choices:
* the logic and ethics of the collaborative networks for the mode of participation of the members (cf the work of Jean-Michel Cornu);
* the massive use of ICT (information and communication technologies) as a means of exchanging among members through its internet portal of French-speaking botany.

All software and applications developed under the network are licensed under CeCILL. The data and documents are mainly distributed under a free Creative Commons license. A close collaboration is established with the french-speaking botanical portal of Wikipedia.

Registration for the Tela Botanica network is free of charge. It gives the possibility to use the logistical and technical means of the Network to set up and develop projects, to participate in the different groups animated within the network and to receive by e-mail the weekly newsletter of botanical news. Registration is done online from the Internet and a global mapping system can view the location of the 15,000 registered (as of June 8, 2011) of the network in more than 60 countries.

The network is run by an NGO which also manages the financial management of the project, with 10 employees (end of 2014), thanks to public (47%) and private (39%) contributions, supplemented by benefits and training 10%) or miscellaneous products (4%), and donations from members of the network, to 3% of resources (€18,000 in 2013). An important but unquantified part comes from the volunteering of the members, who have opportunities for expression, collaborative work and proposal in the forums and other advisory tools and databases and photos put in place by the network (eFlore, Online Notebook, newsletter ...). They can be consulted by the steering committee to obtain an opinion on important choices. They are a key element in the dynamics and life of the network.
Tela Botanica publishes a weekly newsletter on botany, which is broadcast free of charge, exclusively via the Internet. This letter as well as the website are freely accessible and devoid of any publicity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2868">The '''Transglobe Expedition''' was the first expedition to make a circumpolar navigation, traveling the world "vertically" traversing both of the poles using only surface transport.

Starting in 1979 from [[Greenwich]] in the [[United Kingdom]], adventurers [[Sir Ranulph Fiennes]] and [[Charles R. Burton]] went south, arriving at the [[South Pole]] on 15 December 1980.  Over the next 14 months, they went north again, reaching the [[North Pole]] on 11 April 1982.  Travelling south once more, they arrived again in Greenwich on 29 August 1982.&lt;ref&gt;''Guinness Book of World Records 1997''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oliver Shepard]] took part in the Antarctic leg of the expedition.

==Northwest Passage==
As part of the expedition, Fiennes and Burton completed the [[Northwest Passage]]. They left [[Tuktoyaktuk]] on 26 July 1981, in the 18&amp;nbsp;ft open Boston Whaler and reached [[Tanquary Fiord]], 36 days later, on 31 August 1981. Their journey was the first open boat transit of the Northwest Passage from West to East, and covered around {{convert|3000|mi|nmi km|abbr=off}}, taking a route through [[Dolphin and Union Strait]] following the South coast of [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria]] and [[King William Island|King William]] Islands, North, via [[Franklin Strait]] and [[Peel Sound]], to [[Resolute Bay]] (on the southern side of [[Cornwallis Island (Nunavut)|Cornwallis Island]]), around the South and East coasts of [[Devon Island]], through [[Hell Gate, Canada|Hell Gate]] (near [[Cardigan Strait]]) and across [[Norwegian Bay]] to [[Eureka, Nunavut|Eureka]], [[Greely Bay]] and the head of [[Tanquary Fiord]].

Between Tuktoyaktuk and Tanquary Fiord they travelled at an average speed of around {{convert|80|mi|nmi km}} per day.

Once they reached Tanquary Fiord they had to trek {{convert|150|mi|nmi km}} overland, via [[Lake Hazen]], to [[Alert, Nunavut|Alert]], before setting up their winter base camp.

'''Trees for the Future''' is a Maryland-based nonprofit organization founded in 1989 that helps communities around the world plant trees. Through seed distribution, [[agroforestry]] training, and in-country technical assistance, it has empowered rural groups to restore tree cover to their lands, protect the environment and help to preserve traditional livelihoods and cultures for generations.

==Overview==

Started in 1989 by Grace and Dave Deppner, Trees for the Future works with communities in Central America, South America, Africa and Asia to incorporate tree planting into their agricultural activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=searchsummary&amp;orgid=11443 "Trees for the Future"]. Charity Navigator. Accessed April 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit based in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], Trees for the Future also offers individuals and businesses a form of [[carbon offset]] through planting trees.&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, Kristin.

March 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Trees for the Future helped over 200 farmers plant approximately 250,000 forest and fruit trees in [[Léogâne]], the epicenter of the earthquake, and worked with other rural communities. In 2009, due to the organization's increasing network of people on the ground and organizations supporting its work, the Trees for the Future's program had even more success. The organization's Haiti Coordinator, Timote Georges, continues to work with communities along the Arcadine coast to plant trees.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Sunny.

July 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization to date has planted over 65 million [[trees]] worldwide in 30 countries and has served over 11,000 villages around the world. Trees for the Future provides free distance and agroforestry training and education; works in conjunction with over 53 specialists who are experts in agroforestry, [[community development]], [[sustainable agriculture]], land use, livestock management, [[women in development]] and youth education; provides in-country seed distribution, and; works on [[natural resource management]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Trees for the Future created a documentary about its work planting trees called "50 Million Trees and Counting: Trees for the Future".&lt;ref&gt;Deppner, Dave. [https://www.youtube.com/watchv=Qdoe_gI_fSs "50 Million Trees and Counting: Trees for the Future"]. YouTube. November 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, Maryland Senators Richard Madaleno and Brian Frosh, and Maryland Delegate Al Carr announced Senate resolutions recognizing the 20th anniversary of Trees for the Future and the organization's two decades of global activity restoring degraded lands and cutting carbon emissions through the planting of more than 65 million trees.&lt;ref&gt;General Assembly of Maryland [http://mlis.state.md.us/2010rs/votes/senate/219.htm "Resolution Trees for the Future"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}. Senate of Maryland: 2010 Regular Session. February 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trees for the Future partnered with [[SodaStream International]] in 2012 to launch the Replant Our Planet initiative. Sodastream committed to planting ten trees in [[Brazil]] for each home beverage carbonation system sold from its Rethink Your Soda product line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Munarriz|first=Rick Aristotle|title=SodaStream Wants You to Hug a Tree, Drink a Soda|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2012/03/22/sodastream-wants-you-to-hug-a-tree-drink-a-soda.spx|accessdate=29 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Motley Fool]]|date=22 March 2012}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, Trees for the Future is working on 14 projects in Sub-Saharan Africa. The group states that their main goal currently is to create "Forest Garden Programs" in Cameroon, Kenya, Senegal, Uganda, and Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://trees.org/what-we-do/|title=What We Do {{!}} Agroforestry {{!}} Forest Gardens|newspaper=Trees For the Future|access-date=2017-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''windwatt''''' is a [[mudflat]] exposed as a result of wind action on water. They occur especially in the [[Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park]] on Germany's [[Baltic Sea]] coast. The term is German.&lt;ref name="nordmole"&gt;[http://www.nordmole.de/stadt-und-land/ostsee/82-was-ist-windwatt.html ''Was ist Windwatt?''] at www.nordmole.de. Accessed on 17 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the [[Wadden Sea]] along Europe's [[North Sea]] coast, the shallow water zones of the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park are largely unaffected by [[Tide|oceanic tides]]. When there are strong winds in a certain direction, however, water is driven out of the lagoons (the so-called ''[[bodden]]'') into the [[Baltic Sea]], so that several particularly shallow areas of mud become exposed and dry out. The water flows back when the wind turns again.&lt;ref name="nordmole"/&gt; 
These ''windwatts'' are a major source of food for [[migrating birds]] in the [[autumn]]. For the [[Crane (bird)|Crane]], which cross Western Pomeranian bodden country during migration, the ''windwatts'' are one of the most important resting areas in Western Europe.
