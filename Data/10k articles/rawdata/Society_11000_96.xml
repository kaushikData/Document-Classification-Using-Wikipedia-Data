      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1928">'''Ashraaf''' comes from Arabic (أشراف) and is the plural form of Sharif or Shareef (شريف), which literally means "noble" or "privileged". In some countries it used as a term to denote descendants of Muhammed (see Sharif or Shareef). Among South Asian Muslims it used as a term for the [[Muslim]] [[gentry]] in [[South Asia]], usually claiming [[Arab]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] descent. This group is the equivalent, in some ways, of the European concept of the "gentry" and families/clans within this group have a family name that signify their position—often based on descent from [[Muhammad|The Prophet]], [[Sahabah|his immediate circle]], major [[Sufi]] personalities, or from Genghis Khan or other Mongol and Turkish warlords. (See [[Baig]] and [[Khan (title)|Khan]].) Some families also have names based on places in (both places in South Asia and places in Iran, Afghanistan and the Arab world—like Badakhshani from the [[Badakhshan]] province of Afghanistan) or Sufi orders—thus [[Chishti]] or [[Warsi]] might signify an affiliation/reverence to [[Moinuddeen Chishti]] or [[Nizamuddin Chishti]] on the one hand or the saint at ''Dewain Shareef'' on the other. In the latter case, sometimes, a person will not use the name till they have taken a formal oath of allegiance (''bayth'') or been initiated into the order.  Also, in some cases, the name might have been originally acquired by one ancestor in one of the last couple of ways and then used as a family name.

In [[Somalia]] and [[Djibouti]], the term is used to denote a community that is presumed to have been descended from the Prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee V. Cassanelli, ''The shaping of Somali society: reconstructing the history of a pastoral people'', 1600-1900, (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1982), p.131&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Museo de América Aztec warrior.jpg|thumbnail|Head of an Aztec warrior with a "temillotl" top knot, [[Museo de América]], Madrid, Spain]]
'''Aztec warfare''' concerns the aspects associated with the [[military|militaristic]] conventions, forces, [[weapon]]ry and strategic expansions conducted by the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Postclassic]] [[Aztec]] civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]], including particularly the [[military history]] of the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]] involving the [[city-state]]s of [[Tenochtitlan]], [[Texcoco (Aztec site)|Texcoco]], [[Tlacopan]] and other allied [[polity|polities]] of the central Mexican region.

The Aztec armed forces were typically composed of a large number of commoners (''yāōquīzqueh'' {{IPA-nah|jaː.oːˈkiːskeʔ|}}, "those who have gone to war") who possessed only basic military training, and a smaller but still considerable number of professional warriors belonging to the nobility (''[[Pipiltin|pīpiltin]]'' {{IPA-nah|piːˈpiɬtin|}}) and who were organized into warrior societies and ranked according to their achievements. The Aztec state was centered on political expansion and dominance of and exaction of tribute from other city states, and warfare was the basic dynamic force in Aztec politics. [[Aztec society]] was also centered on warfare: every Aztec male received basic military training from an early age and the only possibility of upwards [[social mobility]] for commoners (''[[Macehualtin|mācehualtin]]'' {{IPA-nah|maːseˈwaɬtin|}}) was through military achievement&amp;nbsp;— especially the taking of captives (''māltin'' {{IPA-nah|ˈmaːɬtin|}}, singular ''malli''). Thus, only specifically chosen men served in the military. The [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|sacrifice]] of war captives was an important part of many of the Aztec religious festivals. Warfare was thus the main driving force of both the Aztec economy and [[Aztec religion|religion]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Warfare in Aztec society ==
[[File:Aztec eagle warrior.jpg|thumb|right|Terracotta statue depicting an [[Eagle Warrior]]]]

There were two main objectives in Aztec warfare. The first objective was political: the subjugation of enemy city states ([[Altepetl]]) in order to exact tribute and expand Aztec political hegemony. The second objective was religious and socioeconomic: the taking of captives to be sacrificed in religious ceremonies. These dual objectives also influenced the kind of warfare practiced by the Aztecs. Most warfare was primarily political and was driven by the expectations of the Aztec nobility for the ''[[Tlatoani|Tlahtoāni]]'' {{IPA-nah|t͡ɬaʔtoˈaːni|}} to provide economic growth through expansion and the expectation of the commoners to have a chance of moving up in society through successful warfare. The first action of a ruler elect was always to stage a military campaign which served the dual purpose of showing his ability as a warrior and thus make it clear to subject polities that his rule would be as tough on any rebellious conduct as that of his predecessor, and to provide abundant captives for his coronation ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, Ross. "Moteuczomah Illhuicamina." Aztec Warfare: Imperial Expansion and Political Control. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1988. 158. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A failed coronation campaign was seen as an extremely bad omen for the rule of a Tlatoani and could lead to rebellions of city states subjected by earlier rulers and to the Aztec nobility distrusting his ability to rule&amp;nbsp;— this was the case for [[Tizoc]] who was poisoned by the Aztec nobles after several failed military campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, Ross. "Tizoc." Aztec Warfare: Imperial Expansion and Political Control. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1988. 198. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birth ritual ==
Warriors were essential to Aztec life and culture. At birth, an Aztec boy would receive two symbols of being a warrior. A shield would be placed in his left hand, and an arrow would be placed in his right. After a short ceremony the newly born boy's umbilical cord, shield, and arrow would be taken to a battlefield to be buried by a renowned warrior. These parts would symbolize the rise of a warrior. Each shield and arrow would be made specifically for that boy and would resemble his family and the gods. These birth rituals show the importance of warrior culture to the Aztecs.

As for girls, at birth their umbilical cord would be buried usually under the family fireplace, representing the woman's future life to be in the home taking care of household needs.

== Life outside warfare ==
Since all boys starting at age 15 were trained to become warriors Aztec society as a whole had no standing army. Therefore, warriors would be drafted to a campaign through a Tequital (a payment of goods and labor enforced by the government). Outside of battle, many warriors were farmers and tradesmen. They would learn their trade from their father. Warriors would be married by their early twenties and would be a vital part of Aztec daily life. They would work a certain trade usually passed on through family status. Warriors would be lower class citizens, that when called upon would engage in battle. Being a warrior did, however, present a way to move up in Aztec society. The warrior's life was a chance to change one's social status.{{contradiction inline |reason=contradicts previous sentence |date=February 2016}} If they were successful as a warrior they would be presented with gifts and recognized publicly for their accomplishments in battle. If they reached the rank of Eagle or Jaguar warrior they would be considered as nobles. They would also become full-time warriors working for the city-state to protect merchants and the city itself. They resembled the police force of Aztec society.

== Appearance of warriors ==
Aztec culture valued appearance, and appearance defined people within society. Warriors had a very distinct appearance. Their dress would be in relation to their success, and triumph on the battlefield. Gaining ranks as an Aztec warrior was based on how many enemy soldiers that warrior had captured. A warrior who had taken one captive would carry a [[macuahuitl]], and a [[chimalli]] without any decorations. He would also be rewarded with a manta, and an orange cape with a stripe, a carmine-colored loincloth, and a scorpion-knotted designed cape. (Daily, 145). A two captive warrior would be able to wear sandals on the battlefield. He would also have a feathered warrior suit and a cone shaped cap. The feathered suit and the cone shaped cap appearance are the most common within the Codex Mendoza. A four captive warrior, which would be an ocelot or jaguar warrior, would wear an actual jaguar skin over his body with an open slot for the head.
These warriors would have expensive jewelry and weapons. Their hair style was also unique to their status. The hair would sit at the top of their head and be parted into two sections with a red cord wrapped around it. The red cord would also have an ornament of green, blue, and red feathers. The shields were made of wicker wood and leather, so very few survived.

==Fortifications==
The Aztecs didn't normally maintain tight territorial control within their empire but nonetheless there are examples of fortifications built by the Aztecs. Prominent examples are the strongholds at Oztuma (''Oztōmān'' {{IPA-nah|osˈtoːmaːn|}}) where the Aztecs built a garrison to keep the rebellious [[Tequistlatecan|Chontal]]es in line, in Quauhquechollan (modern-day Huauquechula) near [[Atlixco]] where the Aztecs built a garrison in order to always have forces close to their traditional enemies the [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcalteca]], [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Chololteca]] and Huexotzinca, and in [[Malinalco]] near [[Toluca]]. The latter is where [[Ahuitzotl]] built garrisons and fortifications to keep watch over the [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzinca]], [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]] and [[Otomi people|Otomi]]es and to always have troops close to the enemy [[Tarascan state]] - the borders with which were also guarded and at least partly fortified on both sides.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Flower War===
{{main|Flower war}}

The second kind of warfare practiced by the Aztecs was referred to as [[Flower war]] (''xōchiyāōyōtl'' {{IPA-nah|ʃoːt͡ʃijaːˈoːjoːt͡ɬ|}}). This kind of warfare was fought by smaller armies after a previous arrangement between the parties involved. It was not aimed directly at conquering the enemy city-state ([[altepetl]]) but served a number of other purposes. One often cited purpose is the taking of sacrificial captives and this was certainly an important part of most Aztec warfare. Friar [[Diego Durán]] and the chronicles based on the [[Crónica X]] states that the Xochiyaoyotl was instigated by [[Tlacaelel]] during the great [[Mesoamerica]]n famine of 1450-1454 under the reign of [[Moctezuma I]]. These sources state that Tlacaelel arranged with the leaders of [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]], [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], and [[:es:Huejorzico|Huexotzinco]], and Tliliuhquitepec to engage in ritual battles that would provide all parties with enough sacrificial victims to appease the gods. Ross Hassig (1988) however poses four main political purposes of ''xochiyaoyotl'':

# This kind of warfare gave the Aztecs a chance to demonstrate their military might. Since the Aztec army was larger than their adversaries that were normally smaller city states and since the numbers of combatants on each side were fixed, the Aztec army was sending a much smaller percentage of their total forces than their opponents. Losing a Flower War would then be less damaging for the Aztec army than for its opponents.
# This also meant that an objective was attrition&amp;nbsp;— the large Aztec army could afford to engage in small scale warfare much more frequently than their opponents, who would then gradually tire until they were ripe for actual conquest.
# It also allowed a ruler to maintain hostilities, at low intensity, while occupied by other matters.
# Mainly Xochiyaoyotl served as propaganda both towards other city-states and to the Aztec people allowing the Aztec rulers to continuously demonstrate their might with a constant influx of war captives to Tenochtitlan.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}
# Most importantly, the flower war served as a function of capturing victims to perform ritual sacrifice. To the East of the growing Aztec empire was the city-state of Tlaxcala. The Tlaxcalans were a powerful people who shared their culture and language with the people of the Aztec empire proper. They were closely related to the empire, though never actually conquered by it. An agreement was made with the Tlaxcalans to have ritual battles called xochiyaoyotl. The flower war is a ritual war for Aztec people taking victim back and sacrifice them to their god Xipe Totec ([[Tezcatlipoca]]).

==Organization==
[[Image:Codex Mendoza folio 67r bottom.jpg|thumb|350px|Aztec warriors as depicted in the [[Codex Mendoza]]]]

The Aztec army was organized into two groups. The commoners were organized into "wards" (''[[calpulli|calpōlli]]'') {{IPA-nah|kaɬˈpoːlːi|}} that were under the leadership of ''tiachcahuan'' {{IPA-nah|tiat͡ʃˈkawaːn|}} ("leaders") and ''calpoleque'' {{IPA-nah|kalpoːleʔkeʔ|}} ("calpulli owners"). The nobles were organized into professional warrior societies. Apart from the ''Tlatoani'', the war leaders of the Aztecs were the High General, the ''[[Tlacochcalcatl]]'' {{IPA-nah|t͡ɬakot͡ʃˈkaɬkat͡ɬ|}} ("The man from the house of darts") and the General the ''[[Tlacateccatl|Tlācateccatl]]'' {{IPA-nah|t͡ɬaːkaˈtek.kat͡ɬ|}} ("Cutter of men"). The Tlacochcalcatl and Tlacateccatl also had to name successors prior to any battle so that if they died they could be immediately replaced. Priests also took part in warfare, carrying the effigies of deities into battle alongside the armies. The army also had boys about the age of twelve along with them serving as porters and messengers; this was mainly for training measures. The adjacent image shows the Tlacateccatl and the Tlacochcalcatl and two other officers (probably priests) known as ''[[Huitznahuatl]]'' and ''[[Ticocyahuacatl]]'', all dressed in their ''tlahuiztli'' suits.

===Training===
The formal education of the Aztecs was to train and teach young boys how to function in their society, particularly as warriors. The Aztecs had a relatively small standing army. Only the elite soldiers part of the societies (such as the Jaguar Knights) and the soldiers stationed at the few Aztec fortifications were full-time. Nevertheless, every boy was trained to become a warrior with the exception of nobles. Trades such as farming and artisan skills were not taught at the two formal schools. All boys who were between the ages of ten and twenty years old would attend one of the two schools: the Telpochcalli or the neighborhood school for commoners, and the Calmecac which was the exclusive school for nobles. At the Telpochcalli, students would learn the art of warfare, and would become warriors. At the Calmecac students would be trained to become military leaders, priests, government officials, etc.

The sons of commoners were trained in the ''[[Tēlpochcalli]]'' {{IPA-nah|teːɬpot͡ʃˈkalːi|}} "house of youth". Once a boy reached the age of ten, a section of hair on the back of his head was grown long to indicate that he had not yet taken captives in war. At age fifteen, the father of the boy handed the responsibility of training to the telpochcalli, who would then train the boy to become a warrior. The telpochcalli was accountable for the training of approximately 419 to 559 youths between the ages of fifteen and twenty years old.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, R. 1988, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; While the boys were in training, they were given basic duties, such as cleaning the house and making fires. The youth were tested to determine how fit they would be for battle by accompanying their leaders on campaigns as shield-bearers. War captains and veteran warriors had the role of training the boys how to handle their weapons. This generally included showing them how to hold a shield, how to hold a sword, how to shoot arrows from a bow and how to throw darts with an atlatl.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, R. 1988, 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Boys in training were only considered real men when they captured their first warrior.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen, I. 1991, 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sons of the nobles were trained at the ''[[calmecac]]'' {{IPA-nah|kalˈmekak|}} ("lineage house") and received sophisticated training in warfare from the most experienced warriors in the army, as well as in general courtly subjects such as [[astronomy]], [[tonalpohualli|calendrics]], [[rhetorics]], [[poetry]] and [[Aztec religion|religion]]. The ''calmecac'' were attached to temples as a dedication to patron gods. For example, the calmecac in the main ceremonial complex of Tenochtitlan was dedicated to the god [[Quetzalcoatl]]. Although there is uncertainty about the exact ages that boys entered into the calmecac, according to evidence that recorded the king's sons entering at the age of five and sons of other nobles entering between the ages of six and thirteen, it seems that youth began their training here at a younger age than those in the telpochcalli did.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, R. 1988, 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

When formal training in handling weapons began at age fifteen, youth would begin to accompany the seasoned warriors on campaigns so that they could become accustomed to military life and lose the fear of battle. At age twenty, those who wanted to become warriors officially went to war. The parents of the youth sought out veteran warriors, bringing them foods and gifts with the objective of securing a warrior to be the sponsor of their child. Ideally, the sponsor would watch over the youth and teach him how to take captives. However, the degree to which the warrior looked after and helped the noble’s child depended greatly on the amount of payment received from the parents. Thus, sons of high nobility tended to succeed more often in war than those of lower nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, R. 1988, 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stratification and ranks===
Broadly, Aztec army ranks were similar to the modern Western rankings of “General” and "Major”, as were the groupings of warriors into categories such as “enlisted men” or “officers”. However, while parallels can be drawn between the organization of Aztec and Western military systems, as each developed from similar functional necessities, the differences between the two are far greater than the similarities. The members of the Aztec army had loyalties to many different people and institutions, and ranking was not based solely on the position one held in a centralized military hierarchy. Thus, the classification of ranks and statuses cannot be defined in the same manner as that of the modern Western military.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, R. 1988, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The commoners composed the bulk of the army; the lowest were porters (''[[tlamemeh]]'' {{IPA-nah|t͡ɬaˈmemeʔ|}}) who carried weapons and supplies, next came the youths (identified by the top knot hairstyle they wore) of the ''telpochcalli'' led by their sergeants (the ''tēlpochyahqueh'' {{IPA-nah|teːɬpot͡ʃˈjaʔkeʔ|}} "youth leaders"). Next were the commoners ''yaoquizqueh''. And finally, there were commoners who had taken captives, the so-called ''tlamanih.'' {{IPA-nah|t͡ɬaˈmaniʔ|}} "captors".

Ranking above these came the nobles of the "warrior societies". These were ranked according to the number of captives they had taken in previous battles; the number of captives determined which of the different suits of honor (called ''tlahuiztli'' {{IPA-nah|t͡ɬaˈwist͡ɬi|}}) they were allowed to wear, and allowed them certain rights like being able to wear sandals, jewelry, alter their hairstyles, wear warpaint, carry flowers onto the battlefield, pierce, and tattoo themselves. These tlahuiztli became gradually more spectacular as the ranks progressed, allowing the most excellent warriors who had taken many captives to stand out on the battlefield. The higher ranked warriors were also called "Pipiltin".

[[Image:Codex Mendoza folio 64r.jpg|thumb|290px| This page from the [[Codex Mendoza]] shows the gradual improvements to equipment and ''tlahuiztli'' as a warrior progresses through the ranks from commoner to porter to warrior to captor, and later as a noble progressing in the warrior societies from the noble warrior to "[[Eagle warrior]]" to "[[Jaguar warrior]]" to "Otomitl" to "Shorn One" and finally as "[[Tlacateccatl]]". The Eagle Warrior, Otomitl, and Shorn One figures wear the pamitl.]]

===Warrior societies===
Commoners excelling in warfare could be promoted to the noble class and could enter some of the warrior societies (at least the Eagles and Jaguars). Sons of nobles trained at the Calmecac, however, were expected to enter into one of the societies as they progressed through the ranks. Warriors could shift from one society and into another when they became sufficiently proficient; exactly how this happened is uncertain. Each society had different styles of dress and equipment as well as styles of body paint and adornments.

====Tlamanih====
Tlamanih (captor) was a term that described commoners who had taken captives within the Aztec army, particularly those who had taken one captive.

====Cuextecatl====
Two captive warriors, recognizable by their red and black tlahuiztli and conical hats. This rank was introduced after the military campaign against the [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]] led by  [[Tlahtoāni]] [[Ahuitzotl]].

====Papalotl====
Papalotl (lit. butterfly) were warriors who had taken three captives; this rank wore "butterfly" like banners on their backs.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

====Eagle and Jaguar warriors====

Main articles: [[Eagle warrior]] and [[Jaguar warrior]]

Aztec warriors were called a cuāuhocēlōtl {{IPA-nah|kʷaːwo'seːloːt͡ɬ|}}. The word cuāuhocēlōtl derives from the Eagle warrior cuāuhtli {{IPA-nah|kʷaːwt͡ɬi|}} and the Jaguar Warrior ocēlōtl {{IPA-nah|o'seːloːt͡ɬ|}}. Those Aztec warriors who demonstrated the most bravery and who fought well became either jaguar or eagle warriors. Of all of the Aztec warriors, they were the most feared. Both the jaguar and eagle Aztec warriors wore distinguishing helmets and uniforms. The jaguars were identifiable by the jaguar skins they wore over their entire body, with only their faces showing from within the jaguar head. The eagle Aztec warriors, on the other hand, wore feathered helmets including an open beak.

====Otomies====
{{main|Otomi (military)}}

The Otomies (''Otōntin'') {{IPA-nah|oˈtoːntin|}}) were another warrior society who took their name from the [[Otomi people]] who were renowned for their fierce fighting. In the historical sources, it is often difficult to discern whether the word ''otomitl'' "Otomi" refers to members of the Aztec warrior society or members of the ethnic group who also often joined the Aztec armies as mercenaries or allies. A celebrated member of this warrior sect was [[Tzilacatzin]].

====The Shorn Ones====
The "Shorn Ones" (''Cuachicqueh'' {{IPA-nah|kʷaˈt͡ʃikkeʔ|}}, plural. ''Cuachic'', singular) was the most prestigious warrior society&amp;nbsp;– their heads were shaved apart from a long braid over the left ear. Their bald heads and faces were painted one-half blue and another half red or yellow. They served as imperial shock troops and took on special tasks as well as battlefield assistance roles when needed. Over six captives and dozens of other heroic deeds were required for this rank. They apparently turned down captaincies in order to remain constant battlefield combatants. Recognizable by their yellow tlahuitzli, they had sworn not to take a step backward during a battle on pain of death at the hands of their comrades.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, R. 1988, p. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic Intelligence==
Because the Aztec empire was maintained through warfare or the threat of war with other cities, the gathering of information about those cities was crucial in the process of preparing for a single battle or an extended campaign. Also of great importance was the communication of messages between the military leaders and the warriors on the field so that political initiatives and collaborative ties could be established and maintained. As such, intelligence and communication were vital components in Aztec warfare. The four establishments principally used for these tasks were merchants, formal ambassadors, messengers, and spies.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, R. 1988, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merchants===
Merchants, called [[pochteca]] (singular: pochtecatl), were perhaps the most valued source of intelligence to the Aztec empire. As they traveled throughout the empire and beyond to trade with groups outside the Aztec’s control, the king would often request that the pochteca return from their route with both general and specific information. General information, such as the perceived political climate of the areas traded in, could allow the king to gauge what actions might be necessary to prevent invasions and keep hostility from culminating in large-scale rebellion. As the Aztec’s empire expanded, the merchant’s role gained increasing importance. Because it became harder to obtain information about distant sites in a timely way, especially for those outside the empire, the feedback and warning received from merchants were invaluable. Often, they were the key to the Aztec army’s successful response to external hostility. If a merchant was killed while trading, this was a cause for war. The Aztecs' rapid and violent retaliation following this event is testament to the immense importance that the merchants had to the Aztec empire.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, R. 1988, 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Merchants were very well respected in Aztec society. When merchants traveled south, they transported their merchandise either by canoe or by slaves, who would carry a majority of the goods on their backs. If the caravan was likely to pass through dangerous territory, Aztec warriors accompanied the travelers to provide much-needed protection from wild animals and rival cultures. In return, merchants often provided a military service to the empire by spying on the empire's many enemies while trading in the enemy's cities.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, R. 1988, 150.&lt;/ref&gt; They were able to earn their protection while further helping their empire.

[[File:Aztec warrior and priest.jpeg|480 x 342px|thumbnail|Aztec priest and warrior, 1787.]]

===Ambassadors===
Once the Aztecs had decided to conquer a particular city ([[Altepetl]]), they sent an ambassador from Tenochtitlan to offer the city protection. They would showcase the advantages cities would gain by trading with the empire. The Aztecs, in return, asked for gold or precious stones for the Emperor. They were given 20 days to decide their request. If they refused, more ambassadors were sent to the cities. However, these ambassadors were used as up front threats. Instead of trade, these men would point out the destruction the empire could and would cause if the city were to decline their offer. They were given another 20 days.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, R. 1988, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; If they refused the Aztec army was sent immediately. There were no more warnings. The cities were destroyed and their people were taken as prisoners.

===Messengers===
The Aztecs used a system in which men stationed approximately 4.2 kilometers or 2.6 miles apart along main roads relayed messages from the empire to armies in the field or to distant cities and vice versa. For example, the runners might be sent by the king to inform allies to mobilize if a province began to rebel. Messengers also alerted certain tributary cities of the incoming army and their food needs, carried messages between two opposing armies, and delivered news back to Tenochtitlan about the outcome of the war. While messengers were also used in other regions of Mesoamerica, it was the Aztecs who apparently developed this system to a point of having impressive communicative scope.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, R. 1988, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spies===
Prior to mobilization, formal spies called ''quimichtin'' were sent into the territory of the enemy to gather information that would be advantageous to the Aztecs. Specifically, they were requested to take careful note of the terrain that would be crossed, fortification used, details about the army, and their preparations. These spies also sought out those who were dissidents in the area and paid them for information. The ''quimichtin'' traveled only by night and even spoke the language and wore the style of clothing specific to the region of the enemy. Due to the extremely dangerous nature of this job (they risked a torturous death and the enslavement of their family if discovered), these spies were amply compensated for their work.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, R. 1988, 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aztecs also used a group of trade spies, known as the ''naualoztomeca''. The ''naualoztomeca'' were forced to disguise themselves as they traveled. They sought after rare goods and treasures. The ''naualoztomeca'' were also used for gathering information at the markets and reporting the information to the higher levels of ''pochteca''.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, R. 1988, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==

===Ranged weapons===
[[File:Arrowhead.jpg|thumbnail|An obsidian projectile point]]

''[[Atlatl|Ahtlatl]]:'' (perhaps lit. "non-sling") This weapon was meant to represent the Aztec God [[Opochtli]]. The Aztec dart thrower (known by the Spanish as ''estólica'') was a weapon used to hurl small darts called "''tlacochtli''" with greater force and from greater range than they could be thrown by hand. This weapon was considered by the Aztecs to be suited only for royalty and the most elite warriors in the army, and was usually depicted as being the weapon of the Gods. Murals at [[Teotihuacan]] show warriors using this effective weapon and it is characteristic of the Mesoamerican cultures of central Mexico. Warriors at the front lines of the army would carry the ahtlatl and about three to five tlacochtli, and would launch them after the waves of arrows and sling projectiles as they advanced into battle before engaging into melee combat. The ''ahtlatl'' could also throw spears as its name implies "spear thrower".

''[[Dart (missile)|Tlacochtli]]'': The "darts" launched from an Atlatl, not so much darts but more like big arrows about 5.9 feet long. Tipped with obsidian, fish bones, or copper heads.

''Tlahhuītōlli'': The Aztec war [[bow and arrow|bow]], constructed from the wood of the [[tepozan]] tree, about five feet long and stringed with animal-[[sinew]]. Archers in the Aztec army were designated as '''''Tequihua'''''.

''Mīcomītl'': The Aztec arrow [[quiver]], usually made out of animal hide, it could hold about twenty arrows.

''Yāōmītl:'' War [[arrows]] with barbed obsidian, [[chert]], flint, or bone points. Typically [[Fletch (archery)|fletch]]ed with [[Meleagris|turkey]] or duck feathers.

''Tēmātlatl'': A [[sling (weapon)|sling]] made from [[Furcraea|maguey]] fiber. The Aztecs used oval shaped rocks or hand molded clay balls filled with obsidian flakes or pebbles as projectiles for this weapon. Bernal Diaz del Castillo noted that the hail of stones flung by Aztec slingers was so furious that even well armored Spanish soldiers were wounded.

''Tlacalhuazcuahuitl'': A [[blowgun]] consisting of a hollow reed using poisoned darts for ammunition. The darts used for this weapon were made out of sharpened wood fletched with cotton and usually doused in the neurotoxic secretions from the skin of [[tree frogs]] found in jungle areas of central Mexico. This was used primarily for hunting rather than warfare.

===Melee weapons===

[[File:Quauhololli..jpg|thumb|200px|A representation of a Quauholōlli from the [[Diego Durán|Codex Duran]]]]
''[[Mācuahuitl]]:'' (lit. "hand-wood", or "wood at hand") This weapon was supposed to represent the Aztec God [[Tezcatlipoca]]. Essentially a wooden sword with sharp [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] blades embedded into its sides (similar in appearance and build to a modern [[cricket bat]]). This was the standard armament of the elite cadres.  Also known in Spanish by the [[Taíno language|Taino]] word "[[macana]]". A blow from such a weapon was reputedly capable of decapitating a horse.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig (1988), p.83.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cuahuitl'':(Lit. Wood) A [[Club (weapon)|baton]] made out of hardwood (more than likely oak), reminiscent of the [[agave]] plant's leaves in its shape.

''[[Tepoztopilli|Tepoztōpīlli]]:'' Wooden [[spear]] with a broad head edged with sharp obsidian blades.

''[[Quauholōlli]]:'' A [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]-like weapon, the handle was made out of wood topped with a wooden, rock, or copper ball or sphere.&lt;ref name="Hassig" &gt;Hassig, R. (1998). ''Aztec Warfare: Imperial Expansion and Political Control Oklahoma Press'': Norman. {{ISBN|0-8061-2121-1}} pp. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Tlaximaltepoztli|Tlāximaltepōztli]]:''This weapon was meant to represent the Aztec God [[Tepoztecatl]]. Basically an axe, comparable to a [[tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]], the head of which was made out of either stone, copper or [[bronze]] and had a two side design, one side had a sharp bladed edge while the other one a blunt protrusion.&lt;ref name="MIT Press"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hosler |first1=Dorothy |title=The sounds and colors of Power: The sacred metallurgica technology of ancient West Mexico |date=1994 |publisher=MIT Press |location=London |isbn=0-262-08230-6 |page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mācuāhuitzōctli'': A club about 1.64&amp;nbsp;ft. long, with a knob on each of its four sides and a pointed tip.&lt;!-- pp. 85--&gt;&lt;ref name="Hassig" /&gt;

''Huitzauhqui:'' This weapon was meant to represent the Aztec God [[Huitzilopochtli]]. A wooden club, somewhat resembling a [[baseball bat]]. This weapon was used for melee attacks just as it was made, but other designs were studded with [[flint]] or obsidian cutting elements on its sides.&lt;!-- pp. 85--&gt;&lt;ref name="Hassig" /&gt;

''[[Tecpatl]]'': This weapon was meant to represent the Aztec God [[Xiuhtecuhtli]]. A [[dagger]] with a double sided blade made out of flint or obsidian with an elaborate stone or wooden handle, seven to nine inches overall in length. Although this would have been an effective side arm, this weapon was more commonly used in Aztec sacrifice ceremonies which may point to it being wielded mostly by Aztec warrior priests.

===Armor===
[[File:Amas manuales aztecas.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Modern replicas of Aztec weapons.]]

''[[Chīmalli]]'': Shields made with different materials such as the wooden shield "cuauhchimalli" or maize cane "otlachimalli". There were also ornamental shields decorated with motifs made in featherwork, these were called māhuizzoh chimalli.

''[[Ichcahuipilli|Ichcahuīpīlli]]'': Quilted cotton armor which was soaked in salt water brine and then hung to dry in shade so that the salt would crystallize inside of it. One or two fingers thick, this material was resistant to obsidian swords and atlatl darts.

''Ēhuatl'': (lit. "skin") The tunic that some noble warriors wore over their cotton armour or tlahuiztli,&lt;ref&gt;Hassig (1988), p.&amp;nbsp;83&lt;/ref&gt; known in Spanish as ''[[tilmatli|tilma]]''.

[[File:Aztec costumes and arms people page 99.png|thumb|Aztec warrior dress and weapons]]
''Tlahuiztli'': The distinctively decorated suits of prestigious warriors and members of warrior societies. These suits served as a way to identify warriors according to their achievements in battle as well as rank, alliance, and social status like priesthood or nobility. Usually made to work as a single piece of clothing with an opening in the back, they covered the entire torso and most of the extremities of a warrior, and offered added protection to the wearer. Made with elements of animal hide, leather, and cotton, the tlahuiztli was most effective by enhancing the Ichcahuipilli.

''Cuacalalatli'': The Aztec war helmet, carved out of hardwood. Shaped to represent different animals like [[howler monkeys]], predatory cats, birds, coyotes, or Aztec deities. These helmets protected most of a warriors head down to the jawline, the design allowed the warrior to see through the animal's open jaw and they were decorated according to the wearer's tlahuiztli.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;67-68&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pāmitl'': The identifying emblems that officers and members of prestigious warrior societies wore on their backs. Similar to the Japanese [[sashimono]]. These were frequently unique to their wearers, and were meant to identify the warrior at a distance. These banners allowed officers to coordinate the movement of their units.&lt;ref&gt;John Pohl &amp; charles Robinson III, ''Aztecs and conquistadores. The Spanish Invasion &amp; the Collapse of the Aztec Empire'', Osprey publishing Ltd, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns and battles==
Once the decision of going to war was made the news were proclaimed in the plazas calling for mobilization of the army for several days or weeks in advance. When the troops were ready and any allied cities had been alerted and had given their consent to partake in the campaign the march began. Usually the first to march were the priests carrying the effigies, the next day the nobles marched led by the [[Tlacochcalcatl]] and [[Tlacateccatl]]. And on the third day the main bulk of the army set out with the Tenochca marching first followed by the warriors from the other cities in the alliance (Tepanecas and Texcocas) and lastly the allied forces from other cities, some of these subject cities would also join in gradually during the march as the army passed by their cities. Thanks to the efficient system of roads maintained throughout central Mexico the army marched an estimated average of 19–32 kilometers per day.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, 1988, p.67-68&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the Aztec army varied considerably from small contingents of a few thousand warriors to large armies with tens to hundreds of thousands of warriors. In the war against Coixtlahuacan the Aztec army numbered 200,000 warriors and 100,000 porters. Other sources mention Aztec armies of up to 700,000 men.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}In 1506, an Aztec army numbering 400,000 men conquered Tututepec, a Mixtec kingdom.&lt;ref name=Mexicolore&gt;{{cite web|title=How big was the Aztec army?|url=http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/ask-experts/how-big-was-the-aztec-army|website=Mexicolore|publisher=Mexicolore|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combat===
[[File:Codex Magliabecchi Aztec conch shell trumpeter quiquizoani.png|thumb|270px|This is a [[conch shell]] [[trumpeter]] or quiquizoani.]]
[[File:Tovar-122.jpg|thumbnail|left|This page from the [[Codex Tovar]] depicts the burning of a temple from an annexed city.]]
Battles (sometimes called in Nahuatl by the [[metaphorical]] [[diphrasism]] ''ātl tlachinolli'' {{IPA-nah|aːt͡ɬ t͡ɬat͡ʃiˈnolːi|}} - literally "water fire") usually started at dawn but sometimes during the middle of the day — smoke signals were used to show that a battle was beginning and to coordinate attacks between different divisions of the army. The signal to attack was given by the drums ([[Teponaztli]]) and the [[conch shell]] trumpet (quiquiztli) blown by the trumpeter. Usually the battle began with projectile fire&amp;nbsp;— the bulk of the army was composed of commoners often armed with bows or slings. Then the warriors advanced into melee combat and during this phase, the ''atlatl'' was used&amp;nbsp;— this missile weapon was more effective over shorter distances than slings and bows, and much more lethal. The first warriors to enter into melee were the most distinguished warriors of the ''Cuachicque'' and the ''Otontin'' societies; then came the Eagles and Jaguars; and lastly the commoners and unpracticed youths. Until entering into melee order rank was maintained and the Aztecs would try to surround or outflank the enemy, but once the melee began the ranks dissolved into a fray of individual hand-to-hand fighting. Youths participating in battle for the first time would usually not be allowed to fight before the Aztec victory was ensured, after which they would try to capture prisoners from the fleeing enemy. It is said that, particularly during flower wars, Aztec warriors would try to capture rather than kill their foes, sometimes striving to cut a hamstring or otherwise incapacitate their opponents. This has been used as an argument to explain the defeat of the Aztecs by the Spanish&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen, Inga (1991) Aztecs: An Interpretation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; but this argument has been rejected by many historians — since sources clearly state that Aztecs did kill their Spanish opponents whenever they had the chance, and quickly adapted their combat strategies to their new opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Lockhart, James (ed. and trans.) (1993);''We People Here: Nahuatl Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico''. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restall, Matthew. ''Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest''. [[Oxford University Press]] (2003), {{ISBN|0-19-516077-0}} ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Other Aztec tactical maneuvers included feigned retreats and ambushes where small portions of Aztec forces would attack and then fall back and lure the enemy into a trap where many more warriors were hidden in the terrain. If a defending enemy retreated into their city the battle was continued there&amp;nbsp;— but normally the objective was to conquer a city not destroy it. Once the city was conquered the main temple would be set on fire signaling far and wide, to all concerned, the Aztec victory. If enemies still refused to surrender the rest of the city could be burned as well, but this was uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;The description of Aztec combat is condensed from Hassig, 1988, chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gladiatorial combat===
[[File:Tovar Codex (folio 134).png|thumb|left|This page from the [[Codex Tovar]] depicts a scene of [[Xipe Totec#Human sacrifice|gladiatorial sacrificial]] rite, celebrated on the festival of ''[[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture#Xipe Totec|Tlacaxipehualiztli]]'' (Feast of the [[Flaying]] of Men).]]

Some captives were [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|sacrificed]] to [[Tonatiuh]] in ritual gladiatorial combat (as was the case of the famous warrior [[Tlahuicole]]). In this rite the victim was tethered in place to a large carved circular "stone" ([[temalacatl]])&lt;ref&gt;Matos Moctezuma &amp; Solis Olguín 2002, p.451-2.&lt;/ref&gt; and given a mock weapon.&lt;ref name="Smith 1996, 2003, p.218"&gt;Smith 1996, 2003, p.218.&lt;/ref&gt; The captive was supposed to die fighting against up to four or seven fully armed  [[Jaguar warrior|jaguar]] and  [[Eagle warrior|eagle knights]], whereupon falling he would be promptly disemboweled by a priest, but if the captive survived he was granted freedom.

== Spanish eyewitness description of Aztec warriors ==
{{cquote|
It is one of the most beautiful sights in the world to see them in their battle array because they keep formation wonderfully and are very handsome. Among them are extraordinary brave men who face death with absolute determination. I saw one of them defend himself courageously against two swift horses, and another against three and four, and when the Spanish horseman could not kill him one of the horsemen in desperation hurled his lance, which the Indian caught in the air, and fought with him for more than an hour, until two foot soldiers approached and wounded him with two or three arrows. He turned on one of the soldiers but the other grasped him from behind and stabbed him. During combat they sing and dance and sometimes give the wildest shouts and whistles imaginable, especially when they know they have the advantage. Anyone facing them for the first can be terrified by their screams and their ferocity.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, Ross. ''Aztec Warfare: Imperial Expansion and Political Control''. [[University of Oklahoma Press]] (1995). {{ISBN|978-0-806-12773-6}} p. 124, quoting from the [[Narrative of Some Things of New Spain and of the Great City of Temestitan]] by an anonymous conquistador.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Death and burial ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
Death was an essential part of Aztec culture from sacrifice to burial. Warriors were an especially a part of this cycle and cultural aspect. When a warrior died either from battle or sacrifice, ceremony was involved. Captured warriors would be sacrificed to the sun god and in some cases the warrior would do the sacrifice. If a warrior died in battle his corpse would be burned there on the battlefield rather than at his city-state. An arrow from the fallen warrior on the battlefield would be brought back, dressed in the Sun god insignia and burned, which is curious since arrows were little-used weapons in Mexica armies. 

It was believed by the Aztecs that the same place for the after life of warriors was also the place for women who died during childbirth. Mourning for fallen warriors was a long and sacred process. The mourners for eighty days straight would not bathe and groom themselves. These actions were done to wait for that fallen warrior's soul to reach the Sky of the Sun. Women had a unique role in the mourning of their dead husbands. These women would carry the cloaks of their dead husbands around with them wherever they would go. They would also let down their hair and dance in lament to the sound of beating drums. Sons would also mourn for their dead fathers. They would carry around a small box which contained the jewelry and ear plugs from his father. If an eagle warrior died their burial would be in the eagle warrior hall. They would be cremated and placed in the hall. In addition to their cremated bodies they would be buried with jewelry, jaguar clays, and gold artifacts.

The '''Baloch diaspora''' refers to [[Baloch people]], and their descendants, who have emigrated to places outside the [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan region]] of South-West Asia – a region stretching from southwestern [[Pakistan]] to southeastern [[Iran]] and southern [[Afghanistan]]. The Baloch [[diaspora]] is found throughout the Middle East, South Asia, [[Turkmenistan]], East Africa, Europe, North America and in other parts of the world.

==Pakistan==
{{main|Sindhi Baloch|Baloch of Punjab}}
Within Pakistan, there are significant numbers of Baloch tribes that have migrated partially or totally and settled in regions outside of [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], mostly into [[Sindh]]. Some have also migrated into [[southern Punjab]], especially in the [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]] speaking regions as well as southeast [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. Many have become entirely assimilated into their host cultures. The [[Zardari tribe]] [[Jatoi tribe]] and [[Chandio]] and [[Magsi]] tribes for example are now culturally [[Sindhi Baloch]]. The [[Talpur dynasty]] is a Baloch tribe that ruled over [[Sindh]]. Meanwhile, the [[Leghari]]s of [[Sindh]] and Southern Punjab speak both [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] and [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]].

==Worldwide populations==
===Middle East===
{{Main|Al Balushi}}
{{Further|Pakistanis in Oman|Baloch community in the United Arab Emirates}}
There are large numbers of Baloch living in [[Oman]], the [[UAE]] and other [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]].

===Europe===
There are also significant populations in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], and other [[European countries]].

===Turkmenistan===
{{main|Beluch}}
There is a population of Baloch in [[Turkmenistan]] who migrated there in the early 20th century, estimated in 1997 to number between 38,000 and 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;MOSHKALO, Vyacheslav V. 2000: "[http://users.tpg.com.au/users/goshti/moshkalo.rtf Language and Culture of the Baloch in Turkmenistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609212918/http://users.tpg.com.au/users/goshti/moshkalo.rtf |date=9 June 2011 }}".

Uppsala: Uppsala University, pp. 97–103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=TM Languages of Turkmenistan], Ethnologue.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Africa===
There is also a small but historic Baloch community in East Africa, left over from when the [[Muscat and Oman|Sultanate of Muscat]] ruled over [[Zanzibar]] and the [[Swahili Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;Lodhi, Abdulaziz Y. 2000. A note on the Baloch in East Africa. In: Language in society: eight sociolinguistic essays on Balochi, Studia iranica upsaliensia, no 3, pp 91–95. Edited by Carina Jahani.

A majority of them still have ties to their families back in Makran.

===India===
{{main|Baloch (Gujarat)|Baluch (Uttar Pradesh)}}
There are also a number of settlements of [[Baloch people|Baloch]] in India, mainly in [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Gujarat]]. They now speak either balochi [[Urdu]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], depending on their location.

===North America===
{{Main|Baloch American}}
Smaller but sizeable Baloch communities are found throughout various states in the United States and Canada. Baloch immigrants in North America have formed their own cultural associations and tend to keep the community active through social occasions.

A number of Western retail groups including [[Asda]], [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]], [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] and [[Tesco]] have [[boycott]]ed the practice.&lt;ref name=guardian2009may04/&gt; Although officially banned, as of 2009, the practice has been reported to still be continuing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uzbek cotton fields still using child labour|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8340630.stm|date=11 November 2009|publisher=BBC|author=Rustam Qobil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following widespread global coverage about these practices and in committing to end this practice, the Cabinet of Ministers of Uzbekistan declared its intent to ensure that no one under the age of 18 would participate in the cotton harvest, as highlighted in a report by the US Department of Labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Uzbekistan|url = http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/uzbekistan.htm|website = www.dol.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report also highlights that the Uzbek government also led a monitoring effort utilizing [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] methodology to observe the fall 2014 harvest in all cotton-growing regions of the country, finding 41 child labourers, assessing penalties to 19 school officials and farm managers for the use of child labour and removing children from the fields. However, there are several press reports that these efforts by the government have been merely to save face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Uzbekistan Still Using Child Slaves To Pick Cotton|url = http://www.mintpressnews.com/uzbekistan-still-using-child-slaves-to-pick-cotton/197884/|website = MintPress News|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few instances, reports indicate that a local government authority such as a district or regional governing official or town mayor may have directly ordered the mobilization of students under age 18.

Some NGOs, notably the Uzbek – German Forum for Human Rights (UGF), have attempted to raise awareness of these unethical practices, both worldwide and in Europe. UGF is supported by a host of non-profits and NGOs, including [[Save the Children]] Central Asia.

'''Costa Rican Spanish''' is the form of the [[Spanish language]] spoken in [[Costa Rica]].

==Phonetics==
The distinguishing characteristics of Costa Rican phonetics include the following:
* [[Assibilation]] of the "double-R" phoneme in some speakers (spelled &lt;r&gt; word-initially and &lt;rr&gt; intervocalically), especially in rural areas, resulting in a [[Voiced alveolar fricative|voiced alveolar sibilant]]—thus ''ropa'' {{IPA|[ˈʐopa]}} ("clothing"), ''carro'' {{IPA|[ˈkaʐo]}} ("car"). Assibilation also affects the sequence {{IPA|/tr/}}, giving it a sound that is similar to {{IPA|[tʃ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Canfield|1981|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The double-R phoneme, as well as the single-R phoneme following {{IPA|/t/}}, can also be realized as a [[retroflex approximant]] or [[alveolar approximant]], with a sound similar to the {{IPA|/r/}} of American English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''ropa'' {{IPA|[ˈɹopa/ˈɻopa]}} ("clothing"), ''carro'' {{IPA|[ˈkaɹo/ˈkaɻo]}} ("car") &amp; ''cuatro'' {{IPA|[ˈkwatɹo/ˈkwatɻo]}} ("four").
* Velarization of word-final {{IPA|/n/}} (before a pause or a vowel), i.e. pronunciation as the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[ŋ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Canfield|1981|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Weakening of the {{IPA|/ʝ/}} phoneme, i.e. a tendency to realize it as the approximant {{IPA|[ʝ̞]}} rather than as the fricative {{IPA|[ʝ]}}; in contact with {{IPA|/e/}} or {{IPA|/i/}} the phoneme can be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Canfield|1981|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lipski|1994|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Costa Rican dialect adopted the [[voiceless alveolar affricate]] {{IPA|[t͡s]}} and the cluster {{IPA|[tl]}} (originally {{IPA|/tɬ/}}) represented by the respective digraphs  &lt;tz&gt; and &lt;tl&gt; in loanwords of Nahuatl origin, for example ''[[quetzal]]'' and ''tlapalería'' {{IPA|[t͡ɬapaleˈɾia]}} ('hardware store'). Even words of Greek and Latin origin with &lt;tl&gt;, such as {{wiktes|Atlántico}} and {{wiktes|atleta}}, are pronounced with the affricate: {{IPA|[aˈtlãn̪t̪iko̞]}}, {{IPA|[aˈtle̞t̪a]}} (compare {{IPA|[aðˈlãn̪t̪iko̞]}}, {{IPA|[aðˈle̞t̪a]}} in Spain and other dialects in Hispanic America&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Navarro Tomás|2004|section=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Second person singular pronouns==

===Usted===
''Usted'' is the predominant second person singular pronoun in Costa Rican Spanish.  Some speakers use only ''usted'' in addressing others, never ''vos'' or ''tú''.  Others use both ''usted'' and ''vos'', according to the situation.

===Vos===
''Vos'' is a second person singular pronoun used by many speakers in certain relationships of familiarity or informal contexts.  [[Voseo]] is widely used between friends, family, people of the same age, etc. It is also commonly used in the university context between students. Some adults use ''vos''  to address children or juveniles, but other adults address everyone regardless of age or status with ''usted''. Costa Ricans tend to use ''usted'' with foreigners.

===Tú===
''Tú'' is rarely used in Costa Rican Spanish. However, due in part to the influence of Mexican television programming, Costa Ricans are familiar with [[tuteo]], and some television viewers, especially children, have begun to use it in limited contexts.

== Tiquismos ==
Costa Ricans are colloquially called "ticos" (based on the frequent use of the diminutive ending ''-ico'' following a /t/, as in ''momentico''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Canfield|1981|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus colloquial expressions characteristic of Costa Rica are called ''tiquismos''. ''Tiquismos'' and ''pachuquismos'' are used frequently in Costa Rica. The latter are expressions of popular street Spanish which can be considered vulgar and offensive if used in the wrong context. Many of these words, even when found in a standard Spanish dictionary, do not have the same meaning there as in Costa Rica. Learning colloquial expressions can be a guide to understanding the humor and character of the Costa Rican culture.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.costaricaspanish.net/ Guide to Costa Rican Spanish] (blog).&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are some examples of Costa Rican slang. 
* ''Mae, ese chante es muy tuanis'': "Dude that house is pretty cool".
* ''Esta panta no me cuadra porque me chima las piernas'': "I don’t like these shorts because they chafe my legs".
* ''¡Qué taco me dio esa vara!'': "That thing really scared me!"

'''Dini ya Misambwa''' (Religion of the Ancestor) is an [[African traditional religion]] that has been labeled  an anti-colonial religion&lt;ref name="Institute of Current World Affairs"&gt;[http://www.icwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DER-20.pdf Newsletter], [[Institute of Current World Affairs]], August 1, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;. It is practiced primarily among the [[Luhya speaking people]] of Western [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name="Kustenbauder"&gt;[http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/5326138/Kustenbauder%20-%20Prophetic%20Movements%20Eastern%20Africa%20-%20New%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Africa%20-%20DASH.pdf?sequence=1 Prophetic Movements: Eastern Africa], ''New Encyclopedia of Africa'', 4th edition Pages 261-270, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of religions to fight injustice is not new. Dini ya Misambwa, an [[African traditional religion]], stood against colonialism during the British colonial rule of Kenya. Among other things, it criticized the undermining, by the British colonial government, of elder authority and of the cultural values that had held Kenyan peoples together for ages. 


The undermining of cultural values was potentially more damaging than even the plunder of resources that's felt within the African continent today. We know that autonomous, purposive actors with the necessary capabilities and instruments often attempt to influence others to operate in an equilibrium in which degree of reciprocity and extent of influence establish the relative distribution of behavioral power within the international system (Ward &amp; House, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Ward, M. D., &amp; House, L. L. (1998). A Theory of the Behavioral Power of Nations : THE THEORY OF BEHAVIORAL ... The Journal of Conflict Resolution (1986-1998), 32(1), 3. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/236097972&lt;/ref&gt;

The old authority of the tribal elders had been undermined with the advent of colonial rule. It was the elders in turn who had lent power to the old tribal religion or [[African traditional religion]] and hence it too was also undermined. Left in a spiritual vacuum, many Bukusu and [[luhya people|luhya]], insecure in the rapidly-changing world, gravitated naturally into Christianity (Reed, 1954).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Reed, D. E. (1954). Dini ya Msambwa I: The Bukusu and The Suk. Institute of Current World Affairs, 1–18. Retrieved from http://www.icwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DER-20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Masinde being an elder did not roll-over and run, he should not have been expected to.

Looking at most African countries, one realizes major damage caused by the undermining of traditional elder leadership and the traditional [[African traditional religions]] on the social imaginaries which make Africans who they are, continue to be an issue in every society. It is even more rampant when one thinks of the role religion plays in determining who they are, what they believe and how they should act and react. It’s clear, imported religions have their origin and this origin cannot be disassociated from the belief inherent in the religions. There is a need to free the mind of its conditionings that give priority to religion and may, therefore, serve to exclude other sources of identity derived from collective histories and collective experiences. The illusion into which religion plunges Africans is often the reason for the problems of identity which most African societies struggle with today. An awareness of this illusion and a new understanding of identity as derived from a shared African experience will go a long way in resolving the problem of identity in Africa (Muyingi, 2015). That is why it is important that anyone editing or deleting this post should provide authoritative citation and proof that they are not just trying to rewrite history.&lt;ref&gt;Muyingi, M. A. (2015). Religion : A New Struggle for African Identity. Asia Journal of Theology, 29(1), 88–99. https://doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/2413-3086/2016/120&lt;/ref&gt;

We know from Max Weber that, the state is a relation of men dominating men, a relationship supported using legitimate (i.e. considered to be legitimate) violence (Schriften, Uni, Gerth, &amp; Mills, 1946).&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Schriften, G. P., Uni, M., Gerth, F. H. H., &amp; Mills, W. (1946). "Politics as a Vocation" Max Weber. Munich: Oxford University Press. Retrieved from http://fs2.american.edu/dfagel/www/Class Readings/Weber/PoliticsAsAVocation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Dini Ya Misambwa was therefore not anti-white but an anti-colonial rule, Reed (1954) reports that colonial rule undermined traditional rulers and the values, assumptions, beliefs, and expectations they stood for leaving a vacuum that Dini ya Msambwa tried to fill.

Reed (1954) also reports that the first European to reach Bukusu was Joseph Thomson, who arrived in 1883, he found the Bukusu living in fortified villages surrounded by moats. These were a protection against raids from the Uasin Gishu Masai and the Teso tribe of Uganda. British administration was established in North Nyanza in 1894. The following year the Bukusu killed 25 soldiers of the Sudanese garrison and a punitive expedition was undertaken against them. Their fortified villages were stormed by Sudanese troops and Africans from other tribes, and the fighting ended when the Bukusu acknowledged British rule and promised to abandon their villages. Today they live in scattered homesteads (Reed, 1954).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Although he reports ethnocentrically, we can glean from his writing that the country he found was not desperate, and there was no racism, but terms like “progress” implying adoption of “European way” are telling as for why they might have been resentment!&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

It was founded by [[Elijah Masinde]] in 1936. After Kenyan independence 1968 Dini ya Msambwa was made illegal and Masinde was arrested for fomenting Christian religion hatred.
“The essence of neo-colonialism is that the State which is subject to it is, in theory, independent and has all the outward trappings of international sovereignty. In reality, its economic system and thus its political policy is directed from outside” - Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah (1909–1972). That was the objection that leads to Dini ya Misambwa being banned in post-colonial Kenya not hatred to white people (Bonsu &amp; Ed, 2016). Secondly, a point must be made that
Western scholars were the first to write about ATR. Thus they dominated the study of [[African traditional religions]]. Their writings were borne out of prejudice or probably out of the impatience of the researchers to look at the universal meaning of the terms they used to describe the religious life of African people cited from Asukwo, Adaka &amp; Dimgba, (2013) by (Bonsu &amp; Ed, 2016). [[African traditional religions ]](ATR) practices have suffered from various racial and is leading terminologies. These terminologies which include, but not limited to paganism, heathenism, fetishism, savage, ancestral worship, juju and animism have been used widely by Euro-American
missionaries and researchers in an attempt to belittle African people and religion (Bonsu &amp; Ed, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;Bonsu, N. O., &amp; Ed, B. (2016). [[African traditional religions]] : An Examination of Terminologies Used for Describing the Indigenous Faith of African People, Using an Afrocentric Paradigm by. Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, 9(9), 108–122. Retrieved from http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=6d5c28a3-4535-486f-be91-6ea5871e2b33%40sessionmgr4007&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=4212&lt;/ref&gt;
Dini Ya Misambwa is, therefore, an [[African traditional religions|African traditional religion]]; its followers worshiping in Nyasaye/Were, God is an English word, it has other words in other languages Nyasaye or Were is God in Luhya. Through Ancestral Spirits (Misambwa) in shrines. Just like Abraham, Joseph, Muhamed are ancestors of Christians or Muslims, the people who come before you play a big role in value formation; so it happens in [[African traditional religions]] (Bonsu &amp; Ed, 2016)

'''Duala''' (also spelt '''Douala''', '''Diwala''', '''Dwela''', '''Dualla''' and '''Dwala''') is a [[dialect cluster]] spoken by the [[Duala people|Duala]] and [[Mungo people]]s of [[Cameroon]]. Douala belongs to the [[Bantu languages|Bantu language family]], in a subgroup called [[Sawabantu languages|Sawabantu]]. Maho (2009) treats Douala as a cluster of five languages: Douala proper, Bodiman, Oli (Ewodi, Wuri), [[Pongo language|Pongo]] and Mongo. He also notes a Douala-based pidgin named ''Jo''.

== Popular culture ==
The song "[[Soul Makossa]]", as well as pop songs that repeated its lyrics, internationally popularised the Duala word for "(I) dance", "makossa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inst.at/trans/13Nr/echu13.htm |title=TRANS Nr. 13: George Echu (Yaounde): Multilingualism as a Resource: the Lexical Appropriation of Cameroon Indigenous Languages by English and French |website=Inst.at |date= |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song [[Alane (song)|Alane]] by artist [[Wes Madiko]] is sung in Duala and reached #1 position in over 9 European countries.

'''En with middle hook''' (Ԣ&amp;nbsp;ԣ; italics: &lt;span style="font-family: times, 'Times New Roman', serif"&gt;''Ԣ&amp;nbsp;ԣ''&lt;/span&gt;) is a letter of the [[Cyrillic script]]. Its form is derived from the [[En (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic letter En]] (Н&amp;nbsp;н) by adding a hook to the middle of the right leg.

En with middle hook was formerly used in the alphabet of the [[Chuvash language]], where it represented the [[palatal nasal]] {{IPA|/ɲ/}}.

The '''Federal Communications Commission''' ('''FCC''') is an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency of the United States government]] created by [[statute]] ({{usc|47|151}} and {{usc|47|154}}) to [[Commerce Clause|regulate interstate]]  communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The FCC works towards six goals in the areas of [[broadband]], [[competition]], the [[Radio frequency|spectrum]], the [[media (communication)|media]], [[public safety]] and [[homeland security]], and modernizing itself.&lt;ref name="Federal Communications Commission"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fcc.gov/Reports/ar2008.pdf |title=2008 Performance and Accountability Report |date=September 2008 |publisher=Federal Communications Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCC was formed by the [[Communications Act of 1934]] to replace the radio regulation functions of the [[Federal Radio Commission]]. The FCC took over wire communication regulation from the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]]. The FCC's mandated jurisdiction covers the 50 [[U.S. state|states]], the [[District of Columbia]], and the [[Territories of the United States]]. The FCC also provides varied degrees of cooperation, oversight, and leadership for similar communications bodies in other countries of [[North America]]. The FCC is funded entirely by regulatory fees. It has an estimated fiscal-2016 budget of [[United States dollar|US $]]388 million.  It has 1,688 federal employees, made up of 50% males and 50% females as of December, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fcc.gov/general/employee-profile-fcc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and strategy==
The FCC's mission, specified in Section One of the [[Communications Act of 1934]] and amended by the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] (amendment to 47 U.S.C. §151) is to "make available so far as possible, to all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and world-wide wire and radio communication services with adequate facilities at reasonable charges."

The Act furthermore provides that the FCC was created "for the purpose of the national defense" and "for the purpose of promoting safety of life and property through the use of wire and radio communications."&lt;ref name="Federal Communications Commission"/&gt;

Consistent with the objectives of the Act as well as the 1993 [[Government Performance and Results Act]] (GPRA), the FCC has identified four goals in its 2018-22 Strategic Plan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fcc.gov/document/strategic-plan-2018-2022|title=Strategic Plan 2018-2022|date=2018-02-12|work=Federal Communications Commission|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are:  Closing the Digital Divide, Promoting Innovation, Protecting Consumers &amp; Public Safety, and Reforming the FCC’s Processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Organization and procedures==

===Commissioners===
The FCC is directed by five commissioners appointed by the [[President of the United States]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] for five-year terms, except when filling an unexpired term. The U.S. President designates one of the commissioners to serve as chairman. Only three commissioners may be members of the same [[political party]].  None of them may have a financial interest in any FCC-related business.&lt;ref name=kang2011&gt;{{Cite web|author=Cecilia Kang |publication-date=October 31, 2011 |title=Obama names FCC commissioners, both agency, Hill veterans|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]; Post Tech |accessdate=November 1, 2011|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-tech/post/obama-names-democrats-rosenworcel-gops-pai-to-fcc/2011/10/31/gIQAKG5raM_blog.html?wpisrc=nl_tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FCCwebsite" &gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fcc.gov/commissioners/ |title=FCC Commissioners |accessdate=July 18, 2007 |publisher=FCC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''†''' Commissioners may continue serving until the appointment of their replacements.  However, they may not serve beyond the end of the ''next'' session of Congress following term expiration.&lt;ref&gt;47 USC 154(c)&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, this means that commissioners may serve up to 1 1/2 years beyond the official term expiration dates listed above if no replacement is appointed.  This would end on the date that Congress adjourns its annual session, generally no later than noon on January 3.

Geoffrey Starks (D) was nominated for the vacant position by President Trump on June 1, 2018. Senate confirmation is required for his appointment.

The FCC is organized into seven Bureaus,&lt;ref name=org /&gt; which process applications for licenses and other filings, analyze complaints, conduct investigations, develop and implement regulations, and participate in [[hearing (law)|hearings]].
* The '''Consumer &amp; Governmental Affairs Bureau''' (CGB) develops and implements the FCC's [[consumer protection|consumer policies]], including [[disability rights movement|disability access]]. CGB serves as the public face of the FCC through outreach and education, as well as through their Consumer Center, which is responsible for responding to consumer inquiries and complaints. CGB also maintains collaborative partnerships with state, local, and tribal governments in such areas as emergency preparedness and implementation of new technologies.
* The '''Enforcement Bureau''' (EB) is responsible for enforcement of provisions of the Communications Act 1934, FCC rules, FCC orders, and terms and conditions of station authorizations. Major areas of enforcement that are handled by the Enforcement Bureau are consumer protection, local competition, public safety, and [[homeland security]].
* The '''International Bureau''' (IB) develops international policies in telecommunications, such as coordination of [[frequency allocation]] and orbital assignments so as to minimize cases of international [[electromagnetic interference]] involving U.S. licensees. The International Bureau also oversees FCC compliance with the international [[Radio Regulations]] and other international agreements.
* The '''Media Bureau''' (MB) develops, recommends and administers the policy and licensing programs relating to [[electronic media]], including [[cable television]], [[broadcast television]], and radio in the United States and its territories. The Media Bureau also handles post-licensing matters regarding [[direct broadcast satellite]] service.
* The '''Wireless Telecommunications Bureau''' regulates domestic wireless telecommunications programs and policies, including licensing. The bureau also implements competitive bidding for spectrum auctions and regulates wireless communications services including mobile phones, public safety, and other commercial and private radio services.
* The '''Wireline Competition Bureau''' (WCB) develops policy concerning [[Plain Old Telephone Service|wire line]] telecommunications. The Wireline Competition Bureau's main objective is to promote growth and economical investments in wireline technology infrastructure, development, markets, and services.
* The '''Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau''' was launched in 2006 with a focus on critical communications infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FCC Opens Bureau of Public Safety and Homeland Security|url = https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2021154,00.asp|website = PCMAG|accessdate = November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offices===
The FCC has eleven Staff Offices.&lt;ref name=org&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=FCC Bureaus &amp; Offices|url=https://www.fcc.gov/bureaus-offices|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The FCC's Offices provide support services to the Bureaus.
* The '''Office of Administrative Law Judges''' (OALJ) is responsible for conducting hearings ordered by the Commission. The hearing function includes acting on [[interlocutory|interlocutory requests]] filed in the proceedings such as petitions to intervene, petitions to enlarge issues, and contested discovery requests. An Administrative Law Judge, appointed under the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]], presides at the hearing during which documents and sworn testimony are received in evidence, and witnesses are cross-examined. At the conclusion of the evidentiary phase of a proceeding, the presiding Administrative Law Judge writes and issues an Initial Decision which may be appealed to the Commission.
* The '''Office of Communications Business Opportunities''' (OCBO) promotes telecommunications business opportunities for small, [[minority business enterprise|minority-owned]], and women-owned businesses. OCBO works with [[entrepreneurs]], industry, public interest organizations, individuals, and others to provide information about FCC policies, increase ownership and employment opportunities, foster a diversity of voices and viewpoints over the airwaves, and encourage participation in FCC proceedings.
* The '''Office of Engineering and Technology''' (OET) advises the Commission concerning engineering matters.
** Its chief role is to manage the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], specifically frequency allocation and spectrum usage. OET conducts technical studies of advanced phases of terrestrial and space communications and administers FCC rules regarding radio devices, experimental radio services, and industrial, scientific, and medical equipment.
** OET organizes the [[Technical Advisory Council]], a committee of FCC advisors from major [[telecommunication]] and media corporations.
**  OET operates the Equipment Authorization Branch, which has the task of overseeing equipment authorization for all devices using the electromagnetic energy from 9&amp;nbsp;kHz to 300&amp;nbsp;GHz. OET maintains an electronic database of all Certified equipment which can be easily accessed by the public.
* The '''Office of General Counsel''' serves as the chief legal adviser to the Commission. The General Counsel also represents the Commission in litigation in [[United States federal courts]], recommends decisions in adjudicatory matters before the Commission, assists the Commission in its decision making capacity and performs a variety of legal functions regarding internal and other administrative matters.
* The '''[[Office of Inspector General (United States)|Office of the Inspector General]]''' (OIG) recommends policies to prevent fraud in agency operations. The Inspector General recommends corrective action where appropriate, referring criminal matters to the [[United States Department of Justice]] for potential prosecution.
* The '''Office of Legislative Affairs''' (OLA) is the FCC's liaison to the United States Congress, providing lawmakers with information about FCC regulations. OLA also prepares FCC witnesses for Congressional hearings, and helps create FCC responses to legislative proposals and Congressional inquiries. In addition, OLA is a liaison to other federal agencies, as well as state and local governments.
* The '''Office of the Managing Director''' (OMD) is responsible for the administration and management of the FCC, including the agency's budget, personnel, security, contracts, and publications.
* The '''Office of Media Relations''' (OMR) is responsible for the dissemination of Commission announcements, orders, proceedings, and other information per media requests. OMR manages the FCC Daily Digest, website, and Audio Visual Center.
* The '''Office of the Secretary''' (OSEC) oversees the receipt and distribution of documents filed by the public through electronic and paper filing systems and the FCC Library collection. In addition, OSEC publishes legal notices of Commission decisions in the [[Federal Register]] and the FCC Record.
* The '''Office of Strategic Planning &amp; Policy Analysis''' (OSP), essentially a think tank within the FCC, identifies policy objectives for the agency. OSP works closely with the FCC Chairman and is responsible for monitoring the state of the communications industry to identify trends, issues and overall industry health. OSP acts as expert consultants to the Commission in areas of economic, business, and market analysis. The Office also reviews legal trends and developments not necessarily related to current FCC proceedings, such as [[intellectual property law]], the Internet, and [[electronic commerce]]. Previously OSP was called the Office of Plans and Policy (OPP). OSP is also the home of the FCC's Chief Economist and the Chief Technologist.
* The '''Office of Workplace Diversity''' (OWD) develops policy to provide a full and fair opportunity for all employees, regardless of non-merit factors such as race, religion, gender, color, age, disability, sexual orientation or national origin, to carry out their duties in the workplace free from unlawful discriminatory treatment, including [[sexual harassment]] and retaliation for engaging in legally protected activities.

===Headquarters===
[[File:FCC HQ.jpg|thumb|Federal Communications Commission in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
The FCC leases space in the Portals building in southwest [[Washington, D.C.]] Construction of the Portals building was scheduled to begin on March 1, 1996. In January 1996 the [[General Services Administration]] signed a lease with the building's owners, agreeing to let the FCC lease {{convert|450000|sqft|sqm}} of space in Portals for 20 years, at a cost of $17.3 million per year in 1996 dollars. Prior to its current arrangement, the FCC had space in six buildings by 19th Street NW and M Street NW. The FCC first solicited bids for a new headquarters complex in 1989. In 1991 the GSA selected the Portals site. The FCC had wanted to move into a more expensive area along [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/21835960.html?dids=21835960:21835960&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+24,+1996&amp;author=Maryann+Haggerty&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=FCC+Ends+Long+Fight,+Will+Move+to+Southwest+D.C.&amp;pqatl=google FCC Ends Long Fight, Will Move to Southwest D.C.] ''[[The Washington Post]]''.

===Communications Act of 1934===
In 1934, Congress passed the [[Communications Act of 1934|Communications Act]], which abolished the [[Federal Radio Commission]] and transferred jurisdiction over radio licensing to a new Federal Communications Commission, including in it also the telecommunications jurisdiction previously handled by the Interstate Commerce Commission.

Title II of the Communications Act focused on telecommunications using many concepts borrowed from railroad legislation and Title III contained provisions very similar to the [[Radio Act of 1927]].

===Report on Chain Broadcasting===
In 1940, the Federal Communications Commission issued the "Report on [[Chain Broadcasting]]" which was led by new FCC Chairman [[James Lawrence Fly]] (and [[Telford Taylor]] as general counsel). The major point in the report was the breakup of the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC), which ultimately led to the creation of the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC), but there were two other important points. One was network option time, the culprit here being the [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] (CBS). The report limited the amount of time during the day and at what times the networks may broadcast. Previously a network could demand any time it wanted from an affiliate. The second concerned artist bureaus. The networks served as both agents and employers of artists, which was a conflict of interest the report rectified.&lt;ref&gt;[https://earlyradiohistory.us/1941cb.htm ERH] ''Report on Chain Broadcasting: May 1941'' HTML version&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freeze of 1948===
In assigning television stations to various cities after [[World War II]], the FCC found that it placed many stations too close to each other, resulting in interference. At the same time, it became clear that the designated VHF channels, 2 through 13, were inadequate for nationwide television service. As a result, the FCC stopped giving out construction permits for new licenses in October 1948, under the direction of chairman [[Rosel H. Hyde]]. Most expected this "Freeze" to last six months, but as the allocation of channels to the emerging [[UHF]] technology and the eagerly awaited possibilities of color television were debated, the FCC's re-allocation map of stations did not come until April 1952, with July 1, 1952, as the official beginning of licensing new stations.

Other FCC actions hurt the fledgling [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] and ABC networks. [[AT&amp;T Corporation|American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T)]] forced television coaxial cable users to rent additional radio long lines, discriminating against DuMont, which had no radio network operation. DuMont and ABC protested AT&amp;T's television policies to the FCC, which regulated AT&amp;T's long-line charges, but the commission took no action. The result was that financially marginal DuMont was spending as much in long-line charge as CBS or NBC while using only about 10 to 15 percent of the time and mileage of either larger network.&lt;ref name=Boddy&gt;Boddy, William. ''Fifties Television: the Industry and Its Critics.'' University of Illinois Press, 1992. {{ISBN|978-0-252-06299-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCC's "Sixth Report &amp; Order" ended the Freeze. It would take five years for the U.S. to grow from 108 stations to more than 550. New stations came on line slowly, only five by the end of November 1952. The Sixth Report and Order required some existing TV stations to change channels, but only a few existing VHF stations were required to move to UHF, and a handful of VHF channels were deleted altogether in smaller [[media market]]s like [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and Fort Wayne, Indiana to create markets which were UHF "islands." The report also set aside a number of channels for the newly emerging field of [[public television|educational television]], which hindered struggling [[ABC Television Network|ABC]] and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]]'s quest for affiliates in the more desirable markets where VHF channels were reserved for non-commercial use.

The Sixth Report and Order also provided for the "intermixture" of VHF and UHF channels in most markets; UHF transmitters in the 1950s were not yet powerful enough, nor receivers sensitive enough (if they included UHF tuners at all - they were not formally required until the 1960s [[All-Channel Receiver Act]]), to make UHF viable against entrenched VHF stations. In markets where there were no VHF stations and UHF was the only TV service available, UHF survived. In other markets, which were too small to financially support a television station, too close to VHF outlets in nearby cities, or where UHF was forced to compete with more than one well-established VHF station, UHF had little chance for success.

[[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] had been the largest U.S. city without a TV station by 1952. Senator [[Edwin C. Johnson|Edwin Johnson]] (D-Colorado), chair of the Senate's [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee]], had made it his personal mission to make Denver the first post-Freeze station. The Senator had pressured the FCC, and proved ultimately successful as the first new station (a VHF station) came on-line a remarkable ten days after the Commission formally announced the first post-Freeze construction permits. KFEL (now [[KWGN-TV]])'s first regular telecast was on July 21, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dumonthistory.tv/6.html Clarke Ingram, "The DuMont Television Network: Historical Web Site"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804163725/http://www.dumonthistory.tv/6.html |date=August 4, 2009 }}.

===Telecommunications Act of 1996===
{{main|Telecommunications Act of 1996}}
In 1996, Congress enacted the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], in the wake of the break-up of [[AT&amp;T]] resulting from the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust suit against AT&amp;T. The legislation attempted to create more competition in local telephone service by requiring [[Incumbent local exchange carrier|Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers]] to provide access to their facilities for [[Competitive Local Exchange Carrier]]s.  This policy has thus far had limited success and much criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/experts/crandallr.aspx|title=Robert W. Crandall|work=The Brookings Institution|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102003149/http://www3.brookings.edu/experts/crandallr.aspx|archivedate=November 2, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the [[Internet]], cable services and wireless services has raised questions whether new legislative initiates are needed as to competition in what has come to be called 'broadband' services. Congress has monitored developments but as of 2009 has not undertaken a major revision of applicable regulation. The [[Local Community Radio Act]] in the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]] has gotten out of committee and will go before the house floor with bi-partisan support,&lt;ref name=111-h1147&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1147|title=Local Community Radio Act of 2009|publisher=Govtrack.us|date=October 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and unanimous support of the FCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ4TC9Aqjfc |title=FCC: Unanimous, bipartisan support for LPFM |date=September 17, 2009 |author=FCC Oversight Hearing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress also eliminated the cap on the number of radio stations any one entity could own nationwide and also substantially loosened local radio station ownership restrictions. Substantial radio consolidation followed.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel M. Stilwell, "Which Public - Whose Interest - How the FCC's Deregulation of Radio Station Ownership Has Harmed the Public Interest, and How We Can Escape from the Swamp," 26 Loy. L.A. Ent. L. Rev. 369, March 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Restrictions on ownership of television stations were also loosened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Oxenford |title=Broadcast Law Blog: On the 15th Anniversary of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, The Effect on Broadcasters is Still Debated|date= February 9, 2011|url=http://www.broadcastlawblog.com/2011/02/articles/on-the-15th-anniversary-of-the-telecommunications-act-of-1996-the-effect-on-broadcasters-is-still-debated/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Public comments to the FCC indicated that the public largely believed that the severe consolidation of media ownership had resulted in harm to diversity, localism, and competition in media, and was harmful to the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;See Rachel M. Stilwell, 26 Loy. L.A. Ent. L. Rev. 369, supra.&lt;/ref&gt;

===&lt;span id="David A. Bray"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Modernization of the FCC's information technology systems===

David A. Bray joined the Commission in 2013 as [[Chief Information Officer]] and quickly announced goals of modernizing the FCC's legacy [[information technology]] (IT) systems, citing 200 different systems for only 1750 people a situation he found "perplexing".&lt;ref name="FCC's CIO started young"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fcw.com/articles/2013/11/08/fcc-cio-david-bray.aspx |title=FCC's CIO started young |accessdate=May 2014 |publisher=FCW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FCC Names New CIO and Acting Director"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://fedscoop.com/fcc-names-new-cio-and-acting-managing-director/ |title=FCC Names New CIO and Acting Director |publisher=FedScoop Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts later were documented in a 2015 Harvard Case Study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lnwprogram.org/sites/default/files/2015_Leadership_from_Invention_to_Impact.pdf#12|title=Harvard University's Leadership for a Networked World Program|website=Harvard University's Leadership for a Networked World Program|publisher=Harvard University's Leadership for a Networked World Program|accessdate=March 2016|ref=casestudy1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lnwprogram.org/case-point-building-agile-workforce-and-enterprise-fcc|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222092200/http://lnwprogram.org/case-point-building-agile-workforce-and-enterprise-fcc|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-12-22|title=Case in Point: Building an Agile Workforce and Enterprise at the FCC|website=Case in Point: Building an Agile Workforce and Enterprise at the FCC|publisher=Harvard University's Leadership for a Networked World Program|accessdate=March 2016|ref=casestudy2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Christine Calvosa replaced Bray as the acting CIO of FCC.

===Past chairs and notable commissioners===
{{Main|List of chairmen of the Federal Communications Commission}}

A complete [[List of chairmen of the Federal Communications Commission|list of commissioners]] is available on the FCC website.&lt;ref name="fcc-commissioners"&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC Commissioners 1934-present|url=https://www.fcc.gov/general/commissioners-1934-present|publisher=FCC|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Frieda B. Hennock]] (D-NY) was the first female commissioner of the FCC.

==Media policy==

===Broadcast television and radio===
The FCC regulates broadcast stations, [[repeater]] stations as well as [[commercial broadcasting]] operators who operate and repair certain [[radiotelephone]], television and radio stations. [[Broadcast license]]s are to be renewed if the station meets the "public interest, convenience, or necessity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/radio#ref301716|title=Radio: The Need for Regulation|last=Skretvedt|first=Randy|date=October 5, 2018|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FCC's enforcement powers include [[fine (penalty)|fines]] and broadcast license revocation (see [[FCC MB Docket 04-232]]). [[Legal burden of proof|Burden of proof]] would be on the complainant in a [[petition to deny]].  Fewer than 1% of station renewals are not immediately granted, and only a small fraction of those are ultimately denied.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Cable and satellite===
The FCC first promulgated rules for cable television in 1965, with cable and satellite television now regulated by the FCC under Title VI of the Communications Act.  Congress added Title VI in the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, and made substantial modifications to Title VI in the Cable Television and Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992.  Further modifications to promote cross-modal competition (telephone, video, etc.) were made in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, leading to the current regulatory structure.&lt;ref&gt;FCC Media Bureau, Engineering Division, ''Cable Television'', https://www.fcc.gov/media/engineering/cable-television, visited Nov. 30, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content regulation and indecency===
Broadcast television and radio stations are subject to FCC regulations including restrictions against indecency or obscenity.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly held, beginning soon after the passage of the Communications Act of 1934, that the inherent scarcity of radio spectrum allows the government to impose some types of content restrictions on broadcast license holders notwithstanding the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Red Lion Broadcasting Co. vs. FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;  Cable and satellite providers are also subject to some content regulations under Title VI of the Communications Act such as the prohibition on obscenity, although the limitations are not as restrictive compared to broadcast stations.&lt;ref&gt;FCC Media Bureau, ''Program Content Regulations'', https://www.fcc.gov/media/program-content-regulations, visited Nov. 30, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1981 inauguration of [[Ronald Reagan]] as President of the United States accelerated an already ongoing shift in the FCC towards a decidedly more market-oriented stance.  A number of regulations felt to be outdated were removed, most controversially the [[Fairness Doctrine]] in 1987.

In terms of indecency fines, there was no action taken by the FCC on the case [[Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation|FCC v. Pacifica]] until 1987, about ten years after the [[landmark decision|landmark]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision that defined the power of the FCC over [[decency|indecent]] material as applied to broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bensky | first = Larry | title = Living Room : Interview With Comedian George Carlin | publisher = Pacifica Radio Archives | date =  June 4, 1997 | url =  http://www.pacificaradioarchives.org/recording/pz031546 | accessdate = February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =  Bensky | first = Larry | title = PZ0624b Radical Comedians Box Set DISC TWO | publisher = Pacifica Radio Archives | date =  June 4, 1997 | url =  https://archive.org/details/Pz0624bRadicalComediansBoxSetDiscTwo | accessdate = February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1990s had passed, the FCC began to increase its [[Censorship in the United States#Broadcast censorship|censorship and enforcement of indecency regulations]] in the early 2000s to include a response to the [[Janet Jackson]] "[[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|wardrobe malfunction]]" that occurred during the halftime show of [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]].&lt;ref name="apologeticjackson"&gt;{{cite news|title=Janet Jackson Apologizes for Bared Breast|url=http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/S/SUPER_BOWL_JACKSON?SITE=MAHYC&amp;SECTION=BUSINESS&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT|author=Nekesa Mumbi Moody|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=February 3, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040203025228/http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/S/SUPER_BOWL_JACKSON?SITE=MAHYC&amp;SECTION=BUSINESS&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT|archivedate=February 3, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then on June 15, 2006, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] signed into law the [[Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005]] sponsored by then-[[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Sam Brownback]] (now Governor of Kansas), a former [[Radio presenter|broadcaster]] himself, and endorsed by [[Congress of the united States|Congressman]] [[Fred Upton]] of [[Michigan]] who authored a similar bill in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. The new law stiffens the penalties for each violation of the Act.  The Federal Communications Commission will be able to impose fines in the amount of $325,000 for each violation by each station that violates [[decency]] standards. The legislation raised the fine ten times over the previous maximum of $32,500 per violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/07/AR2006060700287.html|title=The Price for On-Air Indecency Goes Up|last=Ahrens|first=Frank|date=June 8, 2006|work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bill Number S. 193 |work=Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005 (Introduced in Senate) from Congressional THOMAS DB |url=http://www.congress.org/congressorg/bill.xc?billnum=S.193&amp;congress=109 |accessdate=April 11, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050916182346/http://www.congress.org/congressorg/bill.xc?billnum=S.193&amp;congress=109 |archivedate=September 16, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media ownership===
{{Main|Media cross-ownership in the United States}}
The FCC has established rules limiting the national share of media ownership of broadcast television or radio stations.  It has also established cross-ownership rules limiting ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market, in order to ensure a diversity of viewpoints in each market and serve the needs of each local market.

====Diversity====
With the major demographic shifts occurring in the country in terms of the racial-ethnic composition of the population, the FCC has been criticized for ignoring the issue of decreasing racial-ethnic diversity of the media. This includes charges that the FCC has been watering down the limited affirmative action regulations it had on the books, including no longer requiring stations to make public their data on their minority staffing and hiring. In the second half of 2006, groups such as the National Hispanic Media Coalition, the National Latino Media Council, the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, the [[National Institute for Latino Policy]], the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]] (LULAC) and others held town hall meetings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferris |first=David |url=http://nyc.indymedia.org/en/2006/10/77496.html |title=publish.nyc.indymedia.org &amp;#124; FCC Town Hall Meeting Marked by Concerns over Media Consolidation |publisher=Nyc.indymedia.org |date=October 20, 2006 |accessdate=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in California, New York and Texas on media diversity as its effects Latinos and minority communities. They documented widespread and deeply felt community concerns about the negative effects of media concentration and consolidation on racial-ethnic diversity in staffing and programming.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[El Diario La Prensa]]''s [http://www.eldiariony.com/noticias/detail.aspx?section=25&amp;desc=Editorial&amp;id=1512119 editorial] on media diversity.&lt;/ref&gt; At these Latino town hall meetings, the issue of the FCC's lax monitoring of obscene and pornographic material in Spanish-language radio and the lack of racial and national-origin diversity among Latino staff in Spanish-language television were other major themes.

President Barack Obama appointed [[Mark Lloyd]] to the FCC in the newly created post of Associate General Counsel/Chief Diversity Officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediaresearchhub.ssrc.org/mark-lloyd/person_view SSRC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818000420/http://mediaresearchhub.ssrc.org/mark-lloyd/person_view |date=August 18, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsmax.com/ruddy/obama_talk_radio/2009/08/30/253646.html Obama's Diversity Offensive Against Talk Radio August 30, 2009 By Christopher Ruddy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903082135/http://www.newsmax.com/ruddy/obama_talk_radio/2009/08/30/253646.html |date=September 3, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After being successful in opening the FM band as a superior alternative to the AM band by allowing colleges and other schools to start ten-watt [[LPFM]] stations, the FCC banned new ones around 1980.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Numerous controversies have surrounded the [[city of license]] concept as the internet has made it possible to broadcast a single signal to every owned station in the nation at once, particularly when Clear Channel, now [[IHeartMedia]], became the largest FM broadcasting corporation in the US after the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] became law - owning over 1200 stations at its peak. As part of its license to buy more radio stations, Clear Channel was forced to divest all TV stations.

===Digital television transition===
To facilitate the adoption of digital television, the FCC issued a second [[digital TV]] (DTV) channel to each holder of an [[analog TV]] station license. All stations were required to buy and install all new equipment ([[transmitter]]s, TV antennas, and even entirely new [[broadcast tower]]s), and operate for years on both channels.  Each licensee was required to return one of their two channels following the end of the digital television transition.

After delaying the original deadlines of 2006, 2008, and eventually February 17, 2009, on concerns about elderly and rural folk, on June 12, 2009 all full-power analog [[terrestrial TV]] licenses in the U.S. [[Digital television transition in the United States|were terminated as part of the DTV transition]], leaving terrestrial television available only from digital channels and a few low-power [[LPTV]] stations. To help U.S. consumers through the conversion, Congress established a federally sponsored [[Coupon-eligible converter box|DTV Converter Box Coupon Program]] for two free converters per household.

==Wireline policy==
The FCC regulates telecommunications services under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.  Title II imposes common carrier regulation under which carriers offering their services to the general public must provide services to all customers and may not discriminate based on the identity of the customer or the content of the communication.  This is similar to and adapted from regulation of transportation providers (railroad, airline, shipping, etc.) and some public utilities.  Wireless carriers providing telecommunications services are also generally subject to Title II regulation except as exempted by the FCC.&lt;ref&gt;41 USC 332(c)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telephone===
The FCC regulates interstate telephone services under Title II.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was the first major legislative reform since the 1934 Act and took several steps to de-regulate the telephone market and promote competition in both the local and long-distance marketplace.

====From monopoly to competition====
{{see also|History of AT&amp;T}}
The important relationship of the FCC and the American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) Company evolved over the decades.  For many years, the FCC and state officials agreed to regulate the telephone system as a [[natural monopoly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.celtnet.org.uk/telecos/AT&amp;T-Bell-4.php |title=The End of AT&amp;T |date= |accessdate=October 3, 2014 |website=Celnet |publisher=Celnet |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006093659/http://www.celtnet.org.uk/telecos/AT%26T-Bell-4.php |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC controlled telephone rates and imposed other restrictions under Title II to limit the profits of AT&amp;T and ensure nondiscriminatory pricing.

In the 1960s, the FCC began allowing other long-distance companies, namely MCI, to offer specialized services.  In the 1970s, the FCC allowed other companies to expand offerings to the public.&lt;ref name="'70s 327"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher=Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 327|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A lawsuit in 1982 led by the Justice Department after AT&amp;T underpriced other companies, resulted in the [[Breakup of the Bell System]] from AT&amp;T.  Beginning in 1984, the FCC implemented a new goal that all long-distance companies had equal access to the local phone companies' customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1803.html|title=Bell Telephone System|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective January 1, 1984, the Bell System's many [[Bell System#Pre-1984 breakup|member-companies]] were variously merged into seven independent "Regional Holding Companies", also known as [[Regional Bell Operating Company|Regional Bell Operating Companies]] (RBOCs), or "Baby Bells". This divestiture reduced the book value of AT&amp;T by approximately 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-09-21/business/fi-48462_1_system-breakup|title=AT&amp;T BREAKUP II :  Highlights in the History of a Telecommunications Giant|work=latimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
The FCC initially exempted "information services" such as broadband Internet access from regulation under Title II.  The FCC held that information services were distinct from telecommunications services that are subject to common carrier regulation.

However, Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 required the FCC to help accelerate deployment of "advanced telecommunications capability" which included high-quality voice, data, graphics, and video, and to regularly assess its availability.  In August 2015, the FCC said that nearly 55 million Americans did not have access to broadband capable of delivering high-quality voice, data, graphics and video offerings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-launches-inquiry-annual-broadband-progress-report FCC Launches Inquiry For Annual Broadband Progress Report], FCC, August 6, 2015, Mark Wigfield&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 26, 2015, the FCC reclassified broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service, thus subjecting it to Title II regulation, although several exemptions were also created.  The reclassification was done in order to give the FCC a legal basis for imposing net neutrality rules (see below), after earlier attempts to impose such rules on an "information service" had been overturned in court.

====Net neutrality====
{{Main|Net neutrality in the United States}}
In 2005, the FCC formally established the following principles: To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet, Consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice; Consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice, subject to the needs of law enforcement; Consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network; Consumers are entitled to competition among network providers, application and service providers, and content providers.  However, broadband providers were permitted to engage in "reasonable network management."{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

On August 1, 2008 the FCC formally voted 3-to-2 to uphold a complaint against [[Comcast]], the largest cable company in the US, ruling that it had illegally inhibited users of its high-speed Internet service from using [[file-sharing]] software. The FCC imposed no fine, but required Comcast to end such blocking in 2008. FCC chairman [[Kevin J. Martin]] said the order was meant to set a precedent that Internet providers, and indeed all communications companies, could not prevent customers from using their networks the way they see fit unless there is a good reason. In an interview Martin stated that "We are preserving the open character of the Internet" and "We are saying that network operators can't block people from getting access to any content and any applications." Martin's successor, [[Julius Genachowski]] has maintained that the FCC has no plans to regulate the internet, saying: "I've been clear repeatedly that we're not going to regulate the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/archives/2010/04/05/the-fcc-doesnt-need-to-be The FCC Doesn't Need to Be] by Peter Suderman, ''[[Reason Magazine|Reason]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Comcast case highlighted broader issues of whether new legislation is needed to force Internet providers to maintain [[net neutrality]], i.e. treat all uses of their networks equally. The legal complaint against [[Comcast]] related to [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]], software that is commonly used for downloading larger files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/02/technology/02fcc.html | title=F.C.C. Vote Sets Precedent on Unfettered Web Usage|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Saul|last=Hansell|date=August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, the FCC revised the principles from the original Internet policy statement and adopted the Open Internet Order consisting of three rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcc.gov/rulemaking/09-191|title=Preserving the Open Internet|work=fcc.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427204911/http://www.fcc.gov/rulemaking/09-191|archivedate=April 27, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the Internet: '''Transparency'''. Fixed and mobile broadband providers must disclose the network management practices, performance characteristics, and terms and conditions of their broadband services; '''No blocking'''. Fixed broadband providers may not block lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices; mobile broadband providers may not block lawful websites, or block applications that compete with their voice or video telephony services; and '''No unreasonable discrimination'''.

On January 14, 2014 Verizon won their lawsuit over the FCC in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Court. Verizon was suing over increased regulation on internet service providers on the grounds that "even though the Commission has general authority to regulate in this arena, it may not impose requirements that contravene express statutory mandates. Given that the Commission has chosen to classify broadband providers in a manner that exempts them from treatment as common carriers, the Communications Act expressly prohibits the Commission from nonetheless regulating them as such."&lt;ref&gt;United States Court of Appeals. Verizon v. Federal Communications Commission. 14 Jan. 2014. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/3AF8B4D938CDEEA685257C6000532062/$file/11-1355-1474943.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After these setbacks in court, in April 2014 the FCC issued a [[Notice of proposed rulemaking|Notice of Proposed Rulemaking]] regarding a path forward for The Open Internet Order.  On November 10, 2014, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] recommended the FCC reclassify broadband Internet service as a [[telecommunications]] service in order to preserve [[net neutrality]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20141110-EW"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wyatt |first=Edward |title=Obama Asks F.C.C. to Adopt Tough Net Neutrality Rules |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/technology/obama-net-neutrality-fcc.html |date=November 10, 2014 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141114"&gt;{{cite news |author=NYT Editorial Board |title=Why the F.C.C.

On February 26, 2015, the [[FCC]] ruled in favor of [[net neutrality]] by applying [[Common carrier#Telecommunications|Title II (common carrier)]] of the [[Communications Act of 1934]] and [[Telecommunications policy of the United States#Broadband deployment policy objectives|Section 706]] of the [[Communications Act of 1934#Telecommunications Act of 1996|Telecommunications act of 1996]] to the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="FCC-20150226"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=FCC Adopts Strong, Sustainable Rules To Protect The Open Internet  |url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0226/DOC-332260A1.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |date=February 26, 2015 |work=Federal Communications Commission |accessdate=February 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150226"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ruiz |first1=Rebecca R. |last2=Lohr |first2=Steve |title=In Net Neutrality Victory, F.C.C.

The rules prompted debate about the applicability of First Amendment protections to Internet service providers and edge providers. Republican Commissioner [[Ajit Pai]] said the Open Internet Order "posed a special danger" to "First Amendment speech, freedom of expression, [and] even freedom of association."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/is-online-free-speech-under-attack/article/2590519|title=Is online free speech under attack?|newspaper=[[Washington Examiner]]|first=Rudy|last=Takala|authorlink=Rudy Takala|date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democratic member and then-Chairman [[Tom Wheeler]] said in response that the rules were "no more a plan to regulate the Internet than the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] is a plan to regulate free speech.

In August 2018 the FCC admitted that its previous claim that the commenting system used during the Net Neutrality [[Notice of proposed rulemaking|Notice of Proposed Rulemaking]] had been hacked was false.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/06/fcc-admits-it-was-never-actually-hacked/|title=FCC admits it was never actually hacked|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NSA wiretapping===
When it emerged in 2006 that AT&amp;T, BellSouth and Verizon may have broken U.S. laws by aiding the [[National Security Agency]] in possible illegal wiretapping of its customers, Congressional representatives called for an FCC investigation into whether or not those companies broke the law.  The FCC declined to investigate, however, claiming that it could not investigate due to the classified nature of the program– a move that provoked the criticism of members of Congress.

"Today the watchdog agency that oversees the country's telecommunications industry refused to investigate the nation's largest phone companies' reported disclosure of phone records to the NSA," said Rep. [[Edward Markey]] (D-Mass.) in response to the decision. "The FCC, which oversees the protection of [[consumer privacy]] under the Communications Act of 1934, has taken a pass at investigating what is estimated to be the nation's largest violation of consumer privacy ever to occur. If the oversight body that monitors our nation's communications is stepping aside then Congress must step in."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060601030114/http://markey.house.gov/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1610&amp;Itemid=125 FCC Refuses to Investigate NSA Program, Predicting Likely Administration Road Blocks] Edward J. Markey. May 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wireless policy==
The FCC regulates all non-Federal uses of radio frequency spectrum in the United States under Title III of the Communications Act of 1934.  In addition to over-the-air broadcast television and radio stations, this includes commercial mobile (i.e., mobile phone) services, [[amateur radio]], citizen's band radio, theatrical wireless microphone installations, and a very wide variety of other services.  Use of radio spectrum by U.S. federal government agencies is coordinated by the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]], an agency within the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]].

===Commercial mobile service===
Commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers, including all mobile phone carriers, are subject to spectrum and wireless regulations under Title III (similar to broadcasters) as well as common carrier regulations under Title II (similar to wireline telephone carriers), except as provided by the FCC.&lt;ref&gt;47 USC 332(c)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spectrum auctions====
{{Main|Spectrum auction#United States}}
Beginning in 1994, the FCC has usually assigned commercial spectrum licenses through the use of competitive bidding, i.e., spectrum auctions.  These auctions have raised tens of billions of dollars for the U.S. Treasury, and the FCC's auction approach is now widely emulated throughout the world.  The FCC typically obtains spectrum for auction that has been reclaimed from other uses, such as spectrum returned by television broadcasters after the digital television transition, or spectrum made available by federal agencies able to shift their operations to other bands.

===Unlicensed spectrum===
Normally, any intentional radio transmission requires an FCC license pursuant to Title III.  However, in recent decades the FCC has also opened some spectrum bands for unlicensed operations, typically restricting them to low power levels conducive to short-range applications.  This has facilitated the development of a very wide range of common technologies from wireless garage door openers, cordless phones, and baby monitors to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth among others.  However, unlicensed devices — like most radio transmission equipment — must still receive technical approval from the FCC before being sold into the marketplace, including to ensure that such devices cannot be modified by end users to increase transmit power above FCC limits.

====White spaces====
"White spaces" are [[radio frequency spectrum|radio frequencies]] that went unused after the federally mandated transformation of analog TV signal to digital. On October 15, 2008, FCC Chairman Kevin Martin announced his support for the unlicensed use of white spaces. Martin said he was "hoping to take advantage of utilizing these airwaves for broadband services to allow for unlicensed technologies and new innovations in that space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2008/10/fccs_kevin_mart.html|title=FCC's Kevin Martin Supports Freeing White Spaces |accessdate=October 15, 2008|author= Olga Kharif |publisher=Business Week |date=October 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Google]], [[Microsoft]] and other companies are vying for the use of this white-space to support innovation in [[Wi-Fi]] technology. Broadcasters and wireless microphone manufacturers fear that the use of white space would "disrupt their broadcasts and the signals used in sports events and concerts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unwiredview.com/2008/10/15/fcc-chairman-kevin-martin-wants-to-allow-the-use-of-portable-devices-on-white-spaces/ |title=FCC Chairman Kevin Martin wants to allow the use of portable devices on white spaces |accessdate=October 15, 2008 |author=David Gonzalez |publisher=UnWiredView.com |date=October 15, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017020845/http://www.unwiredview.com/2008/10/15/fcc-chairman-kevin-martin-wants-to-allow-the-use-of-portable-devices-on-white-spaces/ |archive-date=October 17, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell phone providers such as T-Mobile USA have mounted pressure on the FCC to instead offer up the white space for sale to boost competition and market leverage.

On November 4, 2008, the FCC commissioners unanimously agreed to open up unused broadcast TV spectrum for unlicensed use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-10082505-94.html |title=FCC opens free 'white space' spectrum |accessdate=November 5, 2008 |author=Marguerite Reardon |work=[[CNET Networks|CNET]]|date=November 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=10688&amp;tag=nl.e550 FCC opens up wireless 'white spaces;' Assessing winners, losers and wild-cards] November 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amateur radio===
Amateur radio operators in the United States must be licensed by the FCC before transmitting.  While the FCC maintains control of the written testing standards, it no longer administers the exams, having delegated that function to private volunteer organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncvec.org/page.php?id=316 History of NCVEC]&lt;/ref&gt; No amateur license class requires examination in Morse code; neither the FCC nor the volunteer organizations test code skills for amateur licenses (commercial license examiners do test code skills for the Radiotelegraph Operator license).

===Broadcasting tower database===
An FCC database provides information about the height and year built of broadcasting towers in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/AsrSearch/asrRegistrationSearch.jsp ASR Registration Search]. Retrieved November 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It does not contain information about the structural types of towers or about the height of towers used by Federal agencies, such as most [[non-directional beacon|NDBs]], [[LORAN-C]] transmission towers or [[VLF]] transmission facilities of the [[US Navy]], or about most towers not used for transmission like the [[BREN Tower]].  These are instead tracked by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] as obstructions to [[air navigation]].

===Criticism for use of proprietary standards===
The FCC has been criticized for ignoring international [[open standard]]s, and instead choosing proprietary closed standards, or allowing communications companies to do so and implement the [[anticompetitive practice]] of [[vendor lock-in]], thereby preventing a free market.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In the case of [[digital TV]], it chose the [[ATSC]] standard, even though [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] was already in use around the world, including [[DVB-S]] [[satellite TV]] in the U.S.  Unlike competing standards, the ATSC system is encumbered by numerous patents, and therefore royalties that make TV sets and [[DTV converter]]s much more expensive than in the rest of the world.  Additionally, the claimed benefit of better [[Television reception|reception]] in rural areas is more than negated in urban areas by [[multipath interference]], which other systems are nearly immune to.  It also cannot be received while in motion for this reason, while all other systems can, even without dedicated [[mobile TV]] signals or receivers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

For [[digital radio]], the FCC chose proprietary [[HD Radio]], which crowds the existing [[FM broadcast band]] and even [[AM broadcast band]] with [[in-band adjacent-channel]] [[sideband]]s, which create noise in other stations.  This is in contrast to worldwide [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]], which uses unused TV channels in the [[VHF]] [[band III]] range.  This too has patent fees, while DAB does not.  While there has been some effort by [[iBiquity]] to lower them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stimson|first=Leslie|title=IBiquity Illuminates License Fees|url=http://www.radioworld.com/article/ibiquity-illuminates-license-fees/222209|publisher=Radio World|accessdate=November 11, 2013|date=November 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111025414/http://www.radioworld.com/article/ibiquity-illuminates-license-fees/222209|archive-date=November 11, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fees for [[HD Radio]] are still an enormous expense when converting each station, and this fee structure presents a potentially high cost [[Barriers to entry|barrier to entry]] for [[community radio]] and other [[non-commercial educational]] stations when entering the HD Radio market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greer|first1=Clarke|author2=Ferguson, Douglas|title=Factors Influencing the Adoption of HD Radio by Local Radio Station Managers|journal=The International Journal on Media Management|year=2008|doi=10.1080/14241270802426725|url=http://www.mediajournal.org/ojs/index.php/jmm/article/viewArticle/90|accessdate=November 11, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111025018/http://www.mediajournal.org/ojs/index.php/jmm/article/viewArticle/90|archivedate=November 11, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Satellite radio]] (also called [[SDARS]] by the FCC) uses two proprietary standards instead of [[DAB-S]], which requires users to change equipment when switching from one provider to the other, and prevents other competitors from offering new choices as stations can do on [[terrestrial radio]]. Had the FCC picked [[DAB-T]] for terrestrial radio, no separate satellite receiver would have been needed at all, and the only difference from DAB receivers in the rest of the world would be the need to tune [[S band]] instead of [[L band]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In [[mobile telephony]], the FCC abandoned the "[[any lawful device]]" principle decided against AT&amp;T [[landline]]s, and has instead allowed each [[mobile phone company]] to dictate what its customers can use.&lt;ref&gt;[[Declan McCullagh|McCullagh D]] (November 7, 2008) [http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10085047-38.html Democratic win could herald wireless Net neutrality.] [[CNET]], viewed 2010-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brodkin|first=Jon|title=Verizon blocks Nexus 7 and will probably get away with it|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/09/verizon-blocks-nexus-7-and-will-probably-get-away-with-it/|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=November 11, 2013|date=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the issue===

====1927 Radio Act====
In the 1927 Radio Act, which was formulated by the predecessor of the FCC (the Federal Radio Commission), section 4(k) stipulated that the commission was authorized to hold hearings for the purpose of developing a greater understanding of the issues for which rules were being crafted. Section 4(k) stated that:

:Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the commission, from time to time, as public convenience, interest, or necessity requires, shall… have the authority to hold hearings, summon witnesses, administer oaths, compel the production of books, documents, and papers and to make such investigations as may be necessary in the performance of its duties.

Thus, it is clear that public consultation, or at least consultation with outside bodies was regarded as central to the Commission's job from early on. Though it should not be surprising, the Act also stipulated that the Commission should verbally communicate with those being assigned licenses. Section 11 of the Act noted:

:If upon examination of any application for a station license or for the renewal or modification of a station license the licensing authority shall determine that public interest, convenience, or necessity would be served by the granting thereof, it shall authorize the issuance, renewal, or modification thereof in accordance with said finding. In the event the licensing authority upon examination of any such application does not reach such decision with respect thereto, it shall notify the applicant thereof, shall fix and give notice of a time and place for hearing thereon, and shall afford such applicant an opportunity to be heard under such rules and regulations as it may prescribe.

====Public hearings====
As early as 1927, there is evidence that public hearings were indeed held; among them, hearings to assess the expansion of the radio broadcast band.&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moss|first1=D.A.|author2=Lackow, J.B.|title=Rethinking the role of history in law &amp; economics: the case of the Federal Radio Commission in 1927 (working paper) |ssrn=1220743}}&lt;/ref&gt; At these early hearings, the goal of having a broad range of viewpoints presented was evident, as not only broadcasters, but also radio engineers and manufacturers were in attendance. Numerous groups representing the general public appeared at the hearings as well, including amateur radio operators and inventors as well as representatives of radio listeners' organizations.

:While some speakers at the 1927 hearings referred to having received "invitations," Herbert Hoover's assistant observed in a letter at the time that "the Radio Commission has sent out a blanket invitation to all people in the country who desire either to appear in person or to submit their recommendations in writing. I do not understand that the Commission has sent for any particular individuals, however" [Letter from George Akerson, assistant to Sec. Hoover, to Mrs. James T. Rourke, Box 497, Commerce Period Papers, Herbert Hoover Presidential Library (March 29, 1927)] (FN 14)&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

Including members of the general public in the discussion was regarded (or at least articulated) as very important to the Commission's deliberations. In fact, FCC Commissioner Bellows noted at the time that "it is the radio listener we must consider above everyone else."&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; Though there were numerous representatives of the general public at the hearing, some expressing their opinions to the commission verbally, overall there was not a great turnout of everyday listeners at the hearings.

Though not a constant fixture of the communications policy-making process, public hearings were occasionally organized as a part of various deliberation processes as the years progressed. For example, seven years after the enactment of the Radio Act, the [[Communications Act of 1934]] was passed, creating the FCC. That year the Federal Government's National Recovery Agency (associated with the New Deal period) held public hearings as a part of its deliberations over the creation of new broadcasting codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mazzocco|first=D|title=Radio's New Deal: The NRA and U.S. Broadcasting, 1933–1935|journal=Journal of Radio Studies|volume=12|issue=1|pages=32–46|doi=10.1207/s15506843jrs1201_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later {{when|date=April 2013}}, the FCC held hearings to address early cross-ownership issues; specifically, whether newspaper companies owning radio stations was in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Risley|first=F.|title=A First Step: The FCC's Investigation Into Newspaper Ownership of Radio Stations|journal=Journal of Radio Studies|year=1995|volume=3|pages=118–129|doi=10.1080/19376529509361978}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "newspaper divorcement hearings" were held between 1941 and 1944, though it appears that these hearings were geared mostly towards discussion by industry stakeholders. Around the same time, the Commission held hearings as a part of its evaluation of the national television standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slotten|first=H.|title=Radio and Television Regulation|year=2000|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1958 held additional hearings on the [[television network]] broadcasting rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barrow|first=R|title=Network Broadcasting – The Report of the FCC Network Study Staff|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|year=1957|volume=22|pages=611–625}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though public hearings were organized somewhat infrequently, there was an obvious public appeal. In his now famous "vast wasteland" speech in 1961, FCC Chairman Newton Minow noted that the commission would hold a "well advertised public hearing" in each community to assure broadcasters were serving the public interest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minow|first=N|title=Television and the Public Interest|journal=Federal Communications Law Journal|year=2003|volume=55|pages=395–406}}&lt;/ref&gt; clearly a move to reconnect the Commission with the public interest (at least rhetorically).

==Experiments==

=== Historical Context ===
Beginning in 1947, syphilis prevention research was being conducted on rabbits  through injection of penicillin. Around this same time there was a large push by medical professionals, including the U.S. Surgeon General [[Thomas Parran Jr.|Dr. Thomas Parran]], to further the knowledge of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and discover more viable treatment options in humans. With the onset of [[World War II]] this emphasis for new knowledge became stronger and won more supporters. This was largely due to an effort to protect the U.S. military population from the increasing infections of STDs such as [[gonorrhea]] as well as the particularly painful regimen of [[prophylaxis]] that involved the injection of a silver proteinate into subjects' penises. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://bioethics.gov/cms/sites/default/files/Ethically-Impossible_PCSBI.pdf ''Ethically Impossible: STD Research in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948''], [[Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues]], published 2011-09-13, accessed 2012-08-29&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that venereal diseases would affect 350,000 soldiers, which would equate to eradicating 2 armed divisions for an entire year. The cost of these losses, which would sum up to about $34 million at the time, put an urgent strain on research for STD treatments.

The first experiment following this push for new developments in STD treatment and preventative measures were the [[Terre Haute prison experiments|Terre Haute Prison Experiments]] from 1943-1944, which were conducted and supported by many of the same individuals who would go on to participate in the Guatemalan Syphilis Experiments only a few years later.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The goal of this experiment was to find a more suitable STD prophylaxis, by infecting human subjects recruited from prison populations with gonorrhea. Though at first, the idea of using human subjects was controversial, the support of Dr. Thomas Parran, and Executive Officer of the U.S. Army Medical Corps, Colonel John A Rodgers allowed Dr. John F. Mahoney and Dr. Cassius J. Van Slyke to begin implementing the experiments. Dr. John Cutler, a young associate of Dr. Mahoney, helped conduct the experiments, and went on to lead the Guatemala Syphilis Experiment.

An official committee at the University of Pittsburgh reported the following on Thomas Parran, M.D., who was a founder of the University’s Graduate School of Public Health: “Dr. Parran’s role, and the extent of his influence in approving, funding, and providing oversight of the Tuskegee and Guatemalan studies, is not entirely clear. Based upon the evidence available today, it might not be possible to determine with certainty Dr. Parran’s level of knowledge and involvement in the studies.” Office of Diversity and Inclusion Review Committee on Parran Hall, University of Pittsburgh, Report and Recommendations (June 11, 2018) p. 4. 

The experiments in Terre Haute were the precursor for the Guatemalan experiments. It was the first to demonstrate how earnestly military leaders pushed for new developments to combat STDs and their willingness to utilize human volunteers to infect. It also explained why the study clinicians would choose Guatemala- to avoid the ethical constraints related to individual consent, other adverse legal consequences, and bad publicity.

=== Subjects ===
In total, 1,308 people were involved in this experiment, and of this group, 678 individuals were documented as getting some form of treatment. This population consisted of commercial prostitutes, prisoners, soldiers, and [[mental hospital]] patients. Their ages ranged from 10 to 72, though the average subject was in their 20s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A documented subject profile provides a detailed description of what the subjects faced within this experiment:&lt;blockquote&gt;Berta was a female patient in the Psychiatric Hospital... in February 1948, Berta was injected in her left arm with syphilis. A month later, she developed scabies (an itchy skin infection cause by a mite). Several weeks later, Dr. Cutler noted that she also developed red bumps where he had injected her arm, lesions on her arms and legs, and her skin was beginning to waste away from her body. Berta was not treated for syphilis until three months after her injection. Soon after, on August 23, Dr. Cutler wrote that Berta appeared as if she was going to die, but he did not specify why. That same day he put gonorrheal pus from another male subject into both of Berta's eyes, as well as in her urethra and rectum. He also re-infected her with syphilis. Several days later, Berta's eyes were filled with pus from the gonorrhea, and she was bleeding from her urethra. Three days later, on August 27, Berta died. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] acknowledges that "the design and conduct of the studies was unethical in many respects, including deliberate exposure of subjects to known serious health threats, lack of knowledge of and consent for experimental procedures by study subjects, and the use of highly vulnerable populations." A total of 83 subjects died, though the exact relationship to the experiment is unclear.

==Aftermath==

=== Apology and Response ===
Information about these experiments was uncovered by Professor [[Susan Mokotoff Reverby]] of [[Wellesley College]]. Reverby found the documents in 2005 while researching the Tuskegee syphilis study, in Cutler's archived papers, and shared her findings with United States government officials.&lt;ref name=CDCFactScheet&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.hhs.gov/1946inoculationstudy/factsheet.html | title = Fact Sheet on the 1946-1948 U.S. Public Health Service Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Inoculation Study | publisher = [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] | accessdate = 2013-04-15 | date = nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boston"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/10/02/wellesley_professor_unearths_a_horror_syphilis_experiments_in_guatemala/|title=Wellesley professor unearths a horror: Syphilis experiments in Guatemala|author=|date=1 October 2010|work=[[Boston Globe]]|accessdate=2 October 2010|quote=|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Collins (geneticist)|Francis Collins]], the NIH director at the time of the revelations, called the experiments "a dark chapter in history of medicine" and commented that modern rules prohibit conducting [[human subject research]] without [[informed consent]].&lt;ref name="nyt20101001"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/health/research/02infect.html|title=U.S. Apologizes for Syphilis Tests in Guatemala|author=[[Donald G.

In October 2010, the U.S. government formally apologized and announced that the violation of human rights in medical research was still to be condemned, regardless of how much time had passed.&lt;ref name="NPRapology"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2010/10/01/130266301/u-s-apologizes-for-medical-research-that-infected-guatemalans-with-syphilis|title=U.S. Apologizes For Syphilis Experiments In Guatemala|last=Hensley|first=Scott|date=1 October 2010|work=[[National Public Radio]]|accessdate=1 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110013859/http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2010/10/01/130266301/u-s-apologizes-for-medical-research-that-infected-guatemalans-with-syphilis|archivedate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=U.S. apologizes for newly revealed syphilis experiments done in Guatemala |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/01/AR2010100104457.html |quote=The United States issued an unusual apology Friday to Guatemala for conducting experiments in the 1940s in which doctors infected soldiers, prisoners and mental patients with syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases.|work=[[Washington Post]] |date=1 October 2010  |accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/irrc_851_weeramantry.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Following the apology, Barak Obama requested an investigation to be conducted by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues on November 24, 2010.

"It is clear from the language of the report that the U.S. researchers understood the profoundly unethical nature of the study. In fact the Guatemalan syphilis study was being carried out just as the “[[Doctors' Trial]]” was unfolding at Nuremberg (December 1946 – August 1947), when 23 German physicians stood trial for participating in Nazi programs to euthanize or medically experiment on concentration camp prisoners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nate|first=Jones|title=Decades Later, NARA Posts Documents on Guatemalan Syphilis Experiments|url=http://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2011/04/25/nara-posts-dr-cutlers-papers-on-medical-experiments-in-guatemala/|work=NSA Archive|publisher=The George Washington University|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues Investigation ====
While the Institute of medicine conducted their review, the [[Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;was asked to convene a panel of international experts to review the current state of [[medical research]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;on humans around the world and ensure that these sorts of incidents do not occur again.&lt;ref name="CDCFactScheet2" /&gt; The Commission report, ''Ethically Impossible: STD Research in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948'', published in September 2011, aimed to answer four questions:

# What occurred in Guatemala between 1946 and 1948 involving a series of STD exposure studies funded by the U.S. PHS?
# To what extent were U.S. government officials and others in the medical research establishment at that time aware of the research protocols and to what extent did they actively facilitate or assist in them?
# What was the historical context in which these studies were done?
# How did the studies comport with or diverge from the relevant medical and ethical standards and conventions of the time? &lt;ref name="ethically_impossible2" /&gt;

The investigation concluded that "the Guatemala experiments involved unconscionable basic violations of ethics, even as judged against the researchers' own recognition of the requirements of the medical ethics of the day."&lt;ref name="ethically_impossible2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-lapses2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/health/14syphilis.html|title=Lapses by American Leaders Seen in Syphilis Tests|last=McNeil|first=Donald G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3063">'''Helen Louisa Kerr''' LLD JP (1859-1940) was a Scottish social reformer.

==Life==
[[File:6 St Colme Street, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|6 St Colme Street, Edinburgh]]
[[File:The grave of Helen Kerr, Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The grave of Helen Kerr, Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh]]
She was born '''Helen Louisa Howden''' on 9 March 1859, the daughter of James Howden, a chartered accountant with Borthwick and Howden, and his wife Mary Elizabeth Shaw Stewart. The family lived at 90 Manor Place in Edinburgh's west end.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1860&lt;/ref&gt;

She and her husband became involved in the Edinburgh Social Union (ESU), trying to provide affordable housing for students. They were both closely linked to [[Patrick Geddes]] in these ventures. In 1896 they purchased 22 flats at Campbells Close in [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's Old Town]]. The town Council showed great confidence in the ESU handing over control of blocks at Tron Square, High School Yards, Potterow and Portsburgh Square. Buy 1901 they controlled 24 blocks. In 1889 she took on the unusual role (for a female at that time) as Superintendent of Housing. In 1902 she met with [[Octavia Hill]] to discuss social housing in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Learning from the Lasses: Women of the Patrick Geddes Circle, by Walter Stephen&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1907 she submitted a report to the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress. In 1918 she was appointed a member of the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes in Scotland. In 1920 [[Edinburgh University]] awarded her an honorary doctorate (LLD) for her contributions to social reform.&lt;ref&gt;Learning from the Lasses: Women of the Patrick Geddes Circle, by Walter Stephen&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1891 they lived at 6 St Colme Street, a huge Georgian townhouse on the prestigious Moray Estate in western Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1910-11&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1920s she was working closely with Elizabeth Haldane (sister of Sir [[William Haldane]]) and Mary Maclagan in the improvement of housing across Britain. In 1921 she helped to establish the Nursing Committee at the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]] and also helped to establish the [[Astley Ainslie Hospital|Astley Ainslie Trust]].

She died in Edinburgh on 8 February 1940 aged 80. She is buried with her husband facing "Lords Row" on the western edge of [[Dean Cemetery]].

==Family==

In 1888 she was married to George Kerr a doctor trained in [[Oxford University]]. The Kerr family were very rich from [[Newfoundland]] fishing companies. The couple initially lived at Gogar House in [[Midlothian]], just west of Edinburgh.

Her sister-in-law Miss Mary Kerr of 9 Great Stuart Street was also involved in many of the ventures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7606">{{for|information about population of India|Demographics of India}}

Various attempts have been made, under the [[British Raj]] and since, to classify the [[demographics of India|population of India]] according to a [[typology (anthropology)|racial typology]].  After the [[independence of India|independence]], in pursuance of the government's policy to discourage distinctions between communities based on [[Race (human categorization)|race]], the 1951 Census of India did away with racial classifications. Today, the national Census of independent India does not recognize any racial groups in India.&lt;ref name=Kumar&gt;Kumar, Jayant. [http://www.censusindia.gov.in/ Indian Census]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5Xlqrcsme?url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/ |date=2008-05-12 }} 2001. September 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars of the colonial epoch attempted to find a method to classify the various groups of India according to the predominant racial theories popular at that time in Europe. This scheme of racial classification was used by the British census of India, which was often integrated with [[Indian caste system|caste system]] considerations.

==Great races==
[[Scientific racism]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries divided humans into three races: [[Caucasian race|Caucasoid]] ([[white people|white]]), [[Mongoloid]] ([[yellow people|yellow]]) and [[Negroid]] ([[black people|black]]).

The indigenous population of India was assumed to be intermediate between Caucasoid and [[Australoid race|Australoid]]. [[Edgar Thurston]]{{year needed|date=February 2018}} named this type ''Homo Dravida'' and described it close to Australoids, with Caucasoid ([[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]]) admixture. As evidence, he adduced the use of the [[boomerang]] by [[Kallar(caste)|Kallar]] and [[Maravar]] warriors and the proficiency at tree-climbing among both the [[Kadirs]] of the [[Anamalai]] hills and the [[Dayaks]] of [[Borneo]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Bates, 'Race, Caste and Tribes in Central India' in: ''The Concept of Race'', ed. Robb, OUP (1995), p. 245, cited after Ajay Skaria, ''Shades of Wildness Tribe, Caste, and Gender in Western India'', The Journal of Asian Studies (1997), p. 730.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Negroid" status of the [[Dravidian people|Dravidians]] however remained disputed. In 1898, [[ethnographer]] [[Friedrich Ratzel]] remarked about the "Mongolian features" of Dravidians, resulting in what he described as his "hypothesis of their [Dravidians] close connection with the population of Tibet", whom he adds "Tibetans may be decidedly reckoned in the Mongol race".&lt;ref name=Ratzel&gt;Ratzel, Freidrich. The History of Mankind. Macmillan and Co.:New York, 1898. {{ISBN|978-81-7158-084-2}} p.358&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' summarized Ratzel's findings over India with,
{{quote| "India is for the author [of the History of Mankind, Ratzel], a region where races have been broken up pulverized, kneaded by conquerors. Doubtless a pre-Dravidian negroid type came first, of low stature and mean physique, though these same are, in India, the result of poor social and economic conditions. Dravidians succeeded negroids, and there may have been [[Malay race|Malay]] intrusions, but Australian affinities are denied. Then succeeded Aryan and Mongol, forming the present potporri through conquest and blending."&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;Mason, O.T. "Scientific Books." ''Science'' Volume 10 (1899) p.21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1900, anthropologist [[Joseph Deniker]] said,
{{quote|the Dravidian race is connected with both the Indonesian and Australian...&lt;!--287--&gt; the Dravidian race, which it would be better to call South Indian, is prevalent among the peoples of Southern India speaking the Dravidian tongues, and also among the [[Kols]] and other people of India... The Veddhas... come much nearer to the Dravidian type, which moreover also penetrates among the populations of India, even into the middle valley of the Ganges.&lt;!--290--&gt;"&lt;ref name="Deniker"&gt;Deniker, Joseph. ''The Races of Man: An Outline of Anthropology and Ethnography.'' Charles Scribner's and Sons: London, 1900. {{ISBN|0-8369-5932-9}} p.498&lt;/ref&gt;}} Deniker groups Dravidians as a "subrace" under "Curly or Wavy Hair Dark Skin" in which he also includes the [[Ethiopid race|Ethiopian]] and Australian.&lt;!--285--&gt;&lt;ref name="Deniker"/&gt; Also, Deniker mentions that the "Indian race has its typical representatives among the Afghans, the Rajputs, the Brahmins and most of North India but it has undergone numerous alterations as a consequence with crosses with Assyriod, Dravidian, Mongol, Turkish, Arab and other elements."&lt;!--290--&gt;&lt;ref name="Deniker"/&gt;

[[Carleton S. Coon]], in his book ''[[The Races of Europe (Coon)|The Races of Europe]]'' (1939), classified the Dravidians as Caucasoid due to their "Caucasoid skull structure" and other physical traits such as noses, eyes and hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=toDUP8bcauMC&amp;pg=PA153 |title=Apart Type Screenplay - Everett C. Borders - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Martial races theory==
{{Main|Martial race}}
The martial races theory was a [[British Empire|British]] [[ideology]] based on the assumption that certain peoples were more martially inclined as opposed to the general populace or other peoples.&lt;ref name="heather_streets_martial"&gt;Heather Streets. ''Martial Races: The military, race and masculinity in British Imperial Culture, 1857-1914''&lt;/ref&gt; The British divided the entire spectrum of Indian [[ethnic]] groups into two categories: a "martial race" and a "non-martial race". The martial race was thought of as typically brave and well built for fighting for e.g.Sikhs , Rajput, jats ,etc.&lt;ref&gt;Rand,Gavin. Martial Races and Imperial Subjects: Violence and Governance in Colonial India 1857–1914. European Review of History.&lt;/ref&gt; The non-martial races were those whom the British believed to be unfit for battle because of their sedentary lifestyle.

The [[Indian rebellion of 1857]] may have played a role in British reinforcement of the martial races theory. During this rebellion, some Indian troops, particularly in Bengal, mutinied, but the [[Dogra]]s, [[Gurkha]]s, [[Garhwal Rifles|Garhwalis]], [[Sikhs]], [[Rajputs]],[[Jats]], [[Kumaonis]] and Pakhtuns ([[Pathans]]) did not join the mutiny and fought on the side of the British Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tinker|first=Hugh|date=1958-01|title=1857 and 1957: the Mutiny and Modern India|url=https://academic.oup.com/ia/article-abstract/34/1/57/2699376?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=International Affairs|language=en|volume=34|issue=1|pages=57–65|doi=10.2307/2605867|issn=1468-2346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars have suggested that this theory was propagated to accelerate recruitment from among these races, while discouraging enlistment of "disloyal" Indians who had sided with the rebel army during the war. This may have been because these rebellious forces were the ones that helped the British in the annexation of Punjab in the past.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/pakistan/8.htm Country Studies: Pakistan] - [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The country of [[Colombia]] is a major source for women and girls subjected to [[human trafficking|trafficking in persons]], specifically [[forced prostitution]] in Latin America, the Caribbean, Western Europe, [[Prostitution in Asia|Asia]], and [[Prostitution in North America|North America]], including the [[Prostitution in the United States|United States]]. Within Colombia, some men are found in conditions of [[forced labor]], but the forced [[prostitution]] of women and [[child prostitution|children]] from rural areas and urban areas remains a larger problem. Individual cases of [[forced marriage]] – a risk factor for trafficking – [[involuntary servitude|involuntary]] domestic servitude, and forced [[begging]] have been reported. Some children are subjected to forced labor in [[Mineral industry of Colombia|mines]] and quarries, in the [[Agriculture in Colombia|agricultural sector]] or as domestic servants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/colombia.htm 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor -Colombia-]&lt;/ref&gt; Groups at high risk for internal trafficking include [[displaced person]]s, poor women in rural areas, and relatives of members of [[criminal organization]]s. [[Colombian Civil War (1960s-present)|Continued armed violence]] in Colombia has displaced many communities, making them vulnerable to human trafficking. [[Guerillas]] and new [[Paramilitary group|illegal armed groups]] forcibly recruit children to join their ranks; the government estimates thousands of children are exploited under such conditions. Members of [[gang]]s and [[organized crime|organized criminal networks]] force their relatives and acquaintances, and displaced persons – typically women and children – into conditions of forced prostitution and forced labor, including forced work in the [[illegal drug trade]]. Colombia also is a destination for foreign child [[sex tourism|sex tourists]], particularly in coastal cities such as Cartagena and Barranquilla. Migrants from South America, Africa, and China transit Colombia en route to the United States and Europe; some may fall victim to traffickers.

The [[Government of Colombia]] fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking in persons. During the reporting period, the government increased law enforcement actions against trafficking offenders, enhanced prevention efforts, and continued to offer victim services through an interagency trafficking operations center and through partnerships with [[NGO]]'s and [[international organization]]s. The significant number of Colombians trafficked abroad, however, reflects the need for increased prevention efforts and victim services.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Colombia".

The [[U.S. State Department]]'s [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 1"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The Government of Colombia increased its human trafficking [[law enforcement]] efforts during the reporting period. Colombia prohibits all forms of trafficking through its trafficking statute, Law 985, which prescribes harsh punishments. Such punishments are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with other serious [[crime]]s, such as [[rape]]. In 2009, Colombian authorities initiated 215 anti-trafficking investigations, reported 200 trafficking [[prosecution]]s, and achieved 14 convictions, sentencing trafficking offenders to periods of imprisonment ranging from 7 to 27 years. Such results compare to 159 investigations and 16 convictions reported for 2008. Investigations of labor trafficking increased dramatically over the reporting period: in 2009, there were 80 reports of potential forced labor offenses; whereas in 2008, there were two. The government maintained partnerships with foreign governments to repatriate trafficking victims and investigate trafficking cases in Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United States. There were no corroborated reports of trafficking-related corruption during the reporting period and the government did not convict any officials for trafficking-related offenses. Public [[prosecutor]]s received training on trafficking issues from an international organization.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The government maintained victim protection efforts, both through direct provision of assistance and in partnership with NGOs and international organizations. The government did not appear to employ formal procedures for identifying trafficking victims among vulnerable populations within the country, such as displaced persons or women in prostitution. Authorities ran an interagency anti-trafficking operations center to refer victims to providers of protective services, as well as to coordinate and track criminal investigation and prosecution of their cases, and collect nationwide information and statistics about trafficking crimes. The government did not operate shelters dedicated to trafficking victims, but referred victims to local NGOs to provide these services. Authorities provided [[medical care|medical]] and [[psychological counseling|psychological care]], access to financial and employment assistance, and information and legal support for judicial processes. The government identified 155 victims of transnational trafficking during 2009, who consisted of near equal numbers of forced labor and [[sex trafficking]] victims, in addition to 14 victims who were trafficked within Colombia. The majority of these victims were adults, and the center provided 78 of these victims with services in collaboration with an NGO. Many victims only requested assistance in returning to their homes, and the government provided safe passage for victims returning home. The government encouraged victims to assist in trafficking investigations and prosecutions, and provided housing to victims participating in these efforts through its witness protection program. However, most victims were reluctant to testify against their traffickers due to fear of reprisals or lack of awareness of their status as victims of a serious crime; four victims participated in prosecutions during the reporting period. Consular officials assisted 110 Colombians trafficked overseas during the reporting period: this represents a significant increase in [[repatriation]] assistance when compared with the 22 trafficking victims assisted by Colombian [[Consular Officer|consular officer]]s abroad in 2008. The government contracted legal advisors and [[social worker]]s to help support Colombians abroad. However, victim services overseas are limited to consular districts with at least 10,000 Colombian residents, and are not likely to be available to victims trafficked to isolated locations. At home, Colombian [[law enforcement]] authorities encourage victims to assist with the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers. There were no reports of victims being jailed or otherwise penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. While there was no specialized legal mechanism whereby the government offered a [[visa (document)|visa]] or [[temporary residency|temporary residence]] status to foreign trafficking victims, the government could provide trafficking victims with temporary permission to remain in the country on a case-by-case basis; these victims were eligible to receive [[humanitarian aid|humanitarian assistance]] from the government.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The government continued substantial prevention efforts against human trafficking. In partnership with international organizations, the government launched a new national trafficking prevention campaign targeting young, low-income Colombians, and concluded a campaign from the previous year; both campaigns included TV commercials, radio spots, and print ads. In collaboration with an international organization, the government also launched a pilot program to combat sex trafficking in two high-risk neighborhoods through public awareness events and training sessions for community leaders. Authorities trained 171 journalists in Medellin, Cartagena, and Cali to improve awareness and increase accurate media coverage of trafficking in persons issues. The [[Ministry of Education (Colombia)|Ministry of Education]] introduced a trafficking in persons component into its [[sexual education]] curriculum. Through its anti-trafficking operations center, the government operated a national call center, which received 7,801 calls during the reporting period. Most calls were citizen requests for information relating to job offers overseas, though 133 suspected trafficking cases from the call center were referred to [[police]] for investigation. The government encouraged more active anti-trafficking efforts at the local level, and two departments implemented anti-trafficking work plans during the reporting period, for a total of 15 departments with such plans. In 2009, the government hosted a national workshop for these departmental committees to share challenges and best practices. Colombian authorities hosted visiting delegations from Trinidad and Tobago, Chile, and Panama, and shared best practices from the anti-trafficking center with these delegations. Article 219 of the Colombian criminal code prohibits organizing or facilitating sexual tourism and provides penalties of 3 to 8 years’ imprisonment, but there were no reported prosecutions or convictions of child sex tourists. No other government campaigns to reduce demand for commercial sex acts were visible during the reporting period, but the government reduced demand for [[child labor]] through public awareness and training efforts, often in partnership with international organizations.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10411">In [[South Korea]], '''immigration policy''' is handled by the immigration services of the [[Ministry of Justice]], Ministry of Labor, [[Ministry of Health and Welfare (South Korea)|Ministry of Health and Welfare]] and the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (South Korea)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]. The [[Nationality Act]], [[Immigration Control Act]], [[Multicultural Families Support Act]], and the [[Framework Act on Treatment of Foreigners]] are the foundations of [[immigration policy]] in Korea. The Korean government initiated a discussion in 2003 on establishing an independent immigration office to accommodate fast-growing immigrant and to prepare inclusive and rational immigration policies; however, there has been little progress. The Foreigner Policy Committee, headed by the Prime Minister, coordinates foreigner-related policies which were handled by many ministries. However, its role is limited because of a shortage of resources and [[Human resources|manpower]]. The establishment of an Immigration Office is expected to solve these problems by concentrating all related resources and manpower under one umbrella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[Interview] Head of immigration service |url=http://www.lawtimes.co.kr/LawNews/News/NewsContents.aspx?kind=AD&amp;serial=51180 |work=LawTimes|author=Jaehong Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the UN Recommendations on Statistics of International Migration revised in 1998, long-term international immigration is recorded after an individual enters a country and establishes his place of residence there for one year or more. Therefore, when the Korean government develops new policies [[immigrant labor]]ers and children of illegal migrants should be counted (to follow this guideline).

==History==

===Korea as a sending country===
Korea was a sending country which sent [[farmer]]s, [[miner]]s, [[nurse]]s and laborers to the [[United States]], [[Germany]] and the [[Middle East]]. The Korean [[diaspora]] around the world consisted of 6.82 million people, as of 2009; there were 2.34 million [[Koreans in China]] and 2.1 million [[Korean American]]s.  The total Korean diaspora (which reached over seven million in 2007)  declined by 0.22 million in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korean.net/morgue/status_1.jsp?tCode=status&amp;dCode=0101|title=Korean Diasporas Statistics|author=Overseas Korean Foundation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220111457/http://www.korean.net/morgue/status_1.jsp?tCode=status&amp;dCode=0101|archivedate=2010-02-20|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Korea as a receiving country===
After the 1988 [[Seoul Olympics]] Korea opened its border to the general public, which resulted in increased exchanges with foreign countries. The [[United Nations]] declared Korea an official receiving country in 2007, and the number of foreigners in Korea grew from 0.39 million in 1997 to one million in 2007. Among these, temporary laborers were 0.63 million and foreigners who married Korean nationals were 0.10 million. The number of illegal immigrants were 0.23 million. The primary sending countries were mostly Asian, such as [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Mongolia]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Bangladesh]]; however, some immigrants come from [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Russia]] and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kosis.kr/static/teen/teen02/1172950_1499.jsp |title=Immigrants in Korea |author=the National Statistics Office |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630044508/http://www.kosis.kr/static/teen/teen02/1172950_1499.jsp |archivedate=June 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Background of growing immigrant population}}Background==

==={{anchor|Rapid economic growth of Korea}}Economic growth===
Korea experienced government-initiated rapid [[economic growth]] beginning during the 1970s, known as the "miracle of Han River". Until the end of the 1980s, Korea sustained its development without foreign laborers due to sufficient labor. However, during the 1990s the low birth rate and growing payroll costs caused a [[labor shortage]] (especially in the [[voluntary sector]]).

==={{anchor|Young women shortage in rural area}}Rural female shortage===
With development and [[urbanization]], many people left rural areas. Young people headed for cities in search of better jobs and a better standard of living. Continuing an [[agrarian society|agrarian]] and [[Confucian society|Confucian]] society tradition, the eldest sons were left behind with their parents.  This trend caused a chronic shortage of marriageable women in rural areas. [[Mail-order bride|International marriage]] began in rural areas, and most international-marriage cases are handled by [[dating service]] companies with commission.&lt;ref&gt;Paper= Global migration and South Korea: foreign workers, foreign brides and the making of a multicultural society (Ethnic and Racial Studies Vol. 32 No. 1 January 2009 pp. 70-92, Andrew Eungi Kim)&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Current immigrant policies}}Policies==

=== Nationality Act===
Effective June 14, 1998, persons with at least one Korean parent are automatically granted Korean nationality from birth, regardless of their decision on whether to choose the nationality of the foreign parent or country of birth (if born outside Korea). The requirements for General Naturalization are as follows:

*Must have had [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] address in the Republic of Korea for more than five consecutive years
*Must be a legal adult, according to Korean civil law
*Must have good conduct
*Must have the ability to maintain a living standard on his/her own assets or skills (or is a dependent member of a family capable of that)
*Must have basic knowledge befitting a Korean national (such as an understanding of the [[Korean language]], customs and culture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hikorea.go.kr/pt/InfoDetailR_en.pt?cttSeq=&amp;categoryId=2&amp;parentId=410&amp;catSeq=500&amp;showMenuId=381 |title=Evaluation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|A new national plan for Immigration Policy|Enhancing national competitiveness with a proactive openness policy|Pursuing quality social integration|Enforcing immigration laws|Protecting human rights of foreigners}}National plan===
Its vision is a world-class Korea, where foreigners live in harmony with Koreans.

;National competitiveness:
*Attracting talent
*Attracting foreign workers for balanced national development

;Social integration:
*Promoting understanding of a multicultural society
*Helping immigrants through marriage settle
*Creating a sound environment for multicultural children
*Creating a friendly environment for the Korean diaspora

;Law enforcement:
*Enforcing immigration laws

*Securing solid citizens

;Human rights:
*Preventing [[discrimination]] and protecting [[human rights]]
*Protecting the human rights of foreigners in detention
*Establishing an effective system for determining [[refugee]] status and supporting refugees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.immigration.go.kr/HP/IMM/icc/basicplan.pdf|title=Basic Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Issues with current immigrant policies}}Problems==
As described in the national plan for immigration policy, the Korean government desires a world-class Korea where foreigners live in harmony with Koreans. However, critics contend that the [[Government of South Korea|Korean government]]’s goals, strategies and policies are fundamentally discriminatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpil.org/opboard/viewbody.php?code=column&amp;page=5&amp;id=143&amp;number=143&amp;keyfield=&amp;key=&amp;category=&amp;BoardType=&amp;admin=|publisher=Beautiful Foundation |title=Korean-language source|author=Attorney Jeonghoon Jang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporary workers and illegal immigrants===
Since 1991 Korea has experienced a large influx of foreign workers, and the government has utilized [[trainee]] programs since 1992. About 10,000 Asian workers came to Korea under this program in 1992, and there were about 57,000 trainees in Korea in June 1996. However, the trainee program experienced problems: the trainees became undocumented workers due to a difference in wages and since they were not classified as laborers, they were not protected by the Labor Standard Law. The Employment Permit Program for foreigners (the government’s foreign-labor policy since 2004) is a product achieved by a decade of interaction between Korean citizens and foreign migrant workers. However, these issues have more details to be resolved.
On the legal front, the Korean state still allows foreigners to apply for low-wage jobs and excludes them from social benefits. The social dimension of nationhood is shown by public-opinion polls of Korean citizens' attitudes towards foreign workers, which demonstrate discrimination.

===Immigration violations of human rights===
There are many reports from legal and illegal immigrants which have jailed in many prisons in South Korea because of small problems or misunderstanding their visas for long time. beside there are some reports about beating the prisoners.
South Korea immigration also forcing them for buying the deportation ticket without any consideration.  Since they broke the law it is only natural they pay for their mistakes.

===Foreign brides and children of multicultural families===
The treatment of foreign brides in Korea and their multicultural children is a political issue, covered by the media and the subject of public debate on [[multiculturalism]]. Sending countries are concerned about their immigrants, due to discrimination against foreigners (except for Westerners){{According to whom|date=December 2017}} in Korea. Since most immigration to Korea comes from [[Southeast Asia]], immigrant treatment (particularly abuse of foreign brides) provokes domestic and diplomatic tensions. Koreans are conflicted about immigration, which is frequently so focused on the birth-rate problem that it is more properly called "bride-importing" than immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2010/03/26/koreas-slow-boiling-demographic-crisis/|title=Korea’s Slow Boiling Demographic Crisis|publisher=Asian Security &amp; US Foreign Relations Blog|author=Prof. Robert Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Settlement in Karnataka is found to be existent at least from the 2nd millennium BC as explored in [[Brahmagiri archaeological site]] near [[Chitradurga]] district, central Karnataka. [[Chandravalli]] exploration has revealed interaction of Roman and Chinese travelers around the 2nd and 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chandravalli]]&lt;/ref&gt; Talagunda&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deccanherald.com/content/591046/kannada-inscription-talagunda-may-replace.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Halmidi]] stand as the oldest excavated inscriptions as available today.

Minor dynasties that have played an important role in the development of [[Kannada language|Kannada]], culture and polity were [[Chutu]]s of Banavasi (feudatory to [[Satavahana|Satavahana Empire]]),&lt;ref name="chutu"&gt;Moraes (1931), p 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chutu1"&gt;Purava HaleGannada or Pre-old Kannada was the language of Banavasi in the early Christian era, the Satavahana and Kadamba eras (Wilks in Rice, B.L.

They are preserved in the Royal Asiatic Society and Indian Historical Research Institute, Mumbai - Moraes (1931), p 385&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, other well known kingdoms that patronized Kannadiga poets and Kannada language were:
* [[Eastern Chalukyas]]&lt;ref name="tuluva"/&gt;
* [[Kakatiya dynasty]]&lt;ref name="tuluva"/&gt;
* [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri]]&lt;ref name="seuna"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 143-144&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Shilahara]]&lt;ref name="tuluva"/&gt;
* [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadambas]] of [[Goa]]&lt;ref name="goa"&gt;The coins of the Kadambas of Goa are unique in that they have alternate inscription of the king's name in Kannada and Devanagari in triplicate. This shows that the native vernacular of the Goa Kadambas was Kannada. Moraes (1931), p 384&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigrants from Karnataka===
In addition to those empires that ruled from the Karnataka region, based on inscriptions and literary evidence historians have discussed the possibility that kingdoms of Kannada origin were established in other parts of India as well.

{{Main article|Musicians of Mysore kingdom|Dasa sahitya|Haridasa|Vachana Sahitya}}

'''[[Dasa sahitya|Dasa Sahitya]]''' is the literature of [[Bhakti movement]] composed by devotees in honor of [[Vishnu|Lord Vishnu]] or one of his [[avatar]]s. ''Dasa'' is literally "servant" in Kannada and ''sahitya'' is literature. ''Haridasas'' ("servants of God") were preachers of [[Bhakti]] to Vishnu. The bhakti literature of these Haridasas is collectively referred to as Dasa Sahitya. It is composed in the Kannada language.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[Haridasa#Contribution to Kannada Literature|Haridasa Contribution to Kannada Literature]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Haridasa]]s''' richly contributed to the heritage of Karntataka music.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sastri"&gt;{{cite book |last= Nilakanta Sastri|first= K.A.|title= A history of South India from prehistoric times to the fall of Vijayanagar|origyear=1955|year=2002|publisher= Indian Branch, Oxford University Press|location= New Delhi|isbn= 0-19-560686-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made an indelible impression on the religious and cultural life of Karnataka by spreading the [[Didacticism|didactic]] teachings in a musical form to the hearts of the common folk.&lt;ref name="spread"&gt;{{cite book |last= Sharma|first= B.N.K|title= History of Dvaita school of Vedanta and its Literature |origyear=1961|year=2000|publisher= Motilal Banarasidass|location= Bombay|isbn= 81-208-1575-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other doyens of Indian classical music, these scholars offered prayer to Vishnu through music, called ''naadopasana.'' The Lord is described as ''Samagana priya,'' and bhakti through music is the most preferred path to 'reach' Him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=OurKarnataka.com(OKC) |url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/states/history/historyofkarnataka37.htm |title=History of Karnataka - The Haridasa Movement |publisher=Ourkarnataka.com |date= |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haridasa compositions are popularly known as ''Devaranamas.'' Compositions like ''[[Krishna Ni Begane Baaro|Krishna Nee Begane Baaro]], Venkatachala Nilayam, Jagadoddharana, [[Tambori|Tamboori]] Meetidava'' are some of the many examples of their scholarly work.

[[File:Veena (close view).jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Veena]] is the most commonly used instrument in Carnatic music.]]

While a lot of ''gadhya'' (literature) is written in praise of the heroic characters of the epics and puranas, there are major works depicting the kings and their rule. These are called ''Naataka'' (plays having wide-ranging stages for performance like Rangamancha staged in either theaters or on streets) and ''[[Bayalata]]'' (ಬಯಲಾಟ).&lt;ref name=Bayal&gt;{{Cite book|author= Manohar Laxman Varadpande|title=History of Indian theatre, Volume 2 |page=311|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZrjC24PuDQC&amp;lpg=RA2-PA311&amp;ots=nRnHXNhi4h&amp;dq=Bayalata%2C%20Indian%20open%20air%20theatre&amp;pg=RA2-PA311#v=onepage&amp;q=Bayalata,%20Indian%20open%20air%20theatre&amp;f=false |publisher= Abhinav Publications|year= 1992|isbn=9788170172789}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its etymology indicates, ''bayalu'' means open-air field and ''ata'' means theater.

==The Kannadiga culture==

===Purana===
The Puranas describe the region as Kishkindha in the age of the Ramayana. There is also literary evidence that the region of Mysore was called "Mahisha Mandala" after the mythological demon Mahishasura. Parashurama and Hanumantha are some epic characters to be cited relating to this place.

===Punya Koti===
One of the most popular and acknowledged [[Jaanapada]] songs is "Dharani mandala madhyadolage" which narrates an incidence between mother cow and an aggressive tiger in a place called Karnataka.

===Vishwa Maanava===
Karnataka as now can be viewed as a multicultural state &amp;mdash; almost all the religions that can be found in India can be found here and there has been lot emigration as well due to which [[multi-ethnic]] diaspora can be seen. As the kingdoms provided a safe centres for development of all cultures we can see a huge diversities from region to region. Even the language and dialects varies from place to place. The language has evolved distinctly in both the backyard (folk/basic/prakrutha) and frontyard (refined and related to Samskrutha/Sankrit) of the culture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} It can be said that the major works of Sanskrit have originated and continues to evolve here.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} [[Shringeri]], Udupi are some of nerve centres. One of the leading examples include a village near [[Shivamogga]] where people speak only Sanskrit till date. Bengaluru has almost all language speakers of India.

[[File:Basava linga.jpg|thumb|Tha ''aikya'' linga of Basavanna &amp;mdash; the ab-initio of social spiritual reformation and a known vachanakaara, at [[Kudalasangama]]]]
One of the most acknowledged concept is to be a ''Vishwa Maanava'' or universal being. In Kuvempu's ideology this has a renowned explanation "Every Child is born as a Vishwa Maanava or a Universal Human. It is we who make him Alpa Maanava or Little Human by putting various constrictions of borders rituals and castes. It hence becomes responsibility of our culture to again make him a Universal Being unbound and free." The Kannadiga culture is known to provide shelter and self-respect to people by owning them and their culture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Two colonies for refugees from Tibet are formed, one near [[Mundgod]] and one near [[Kushalanagara]], protecting them from Chinese atrocities. Karnataka has sheltered flood victims of northeastern India like Assam and provided them jobs. One of the easily seen diversity is the surnames which vary from hugely like some may involve names involving a Hindu and Muslim name or having a Hindu Christian name (more found in Mangalore) or even a Muslim Christian name.

Karnataka and parts of Maharashtra are the only states which have diversity of including [[Malenadu]] Nithyaharidwarna &amp;mdash; evergreen ghats and [[Bayaluseeme]] which have different ways of living in the same state.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Not only this but it acts as a gateway to North and [[South Indian culture]]s. It may come as a surprise that Karnataka is next only to [[Rajasthan]] in India when it comes to area under arid land but still Southern Karnataka is referred to as [[Karnataka|Gandhada Gudi]] &amp;mdash; temple of sandalwood found in its protected forests.&lt;ref&gt;http://ksdl.karnataka.gov.in/cultivation-of-sandal-wood/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political sphere===
After the Odeyar era who already had established democracy by naming elected representative called Saamantha in southern regions as early as the 19th century, the 1947 partition brought a centre into being under democracy and Karnataka accepted a [[bicameral]] legislature. But this was a functionally a failure as there always has been a tug of war from centre and states to an extent that from the 1990s to 2010 there have always been different political parties operating at centre and state. North Karnataka had other problems of getting independence more from Nizams. So there were two spheres. Lack of will and coordination and constant fights have been hallmark of politics which has prevented a regional party/media from arising in the land. [[Kerala]] being a neighbour where hugely successful communist ideology in bringing up literacy levels has a backing here and a few [[naxalite]] outfits function in Karnataka.

Functional failure of all pillars of democracy even being upper riparian state can be clearly seen in the [[Kaveri River Water Dispute]] issue. The failure extended to bureaucracy and Karnataka reached the position of being fourth most corrupt state of India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/may/29kgovt1.htm |title=Bureaucratic Corruption |publisher=Rediff.com |date= |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to political and bureaucratic lobby. Because of this, Lokayukta (see [[N. Venkatachala]]) was formed but could not get the required powers to deal with the powerful. In the field of press and journalism [[P. Lankesh]] and [[S. Gurumurthy]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://gurumurthy.net/index.php?value=interview ''S Gurumurthy of The New Indian Express''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008084526/http://gurumurthy.net/index.php?value=interview |date=8 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are some of the noted ones famous for their leftist affiliations.

===Horanadu Kannadiga===
Horanadu Kannadigas (or non-resident Kannadigas) are Kannadigas who have migrated to another state or country, people of Kannada origin born outside Karnataka, or people of Kannada origin who reside permanently outside of Karnataka. [[N R Narayana Murthy]], speaking at the 2011 World Kannada Conference, opined that Kannadigas who move out of the state are respected everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Belgaum, March 11, DHNS: |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/145029/nrn-opens-heart-kannadigas.html |title=NRN opens heart to Kannadigas |publisher=Deccanherald.com |date= |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the failure in political arena has reflected in the cultural isolation of emigrants, some of the successful functional bodies include Singara ([[Singapore]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singara.org/aboutus.php Singara - Kannada Sangha (Singapore)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210121229/http://www.singara.org/aboutus.php |date=10 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dehali Kannadiga ([[New Delhi]]), Mumbai Karnataka Sangha ([[Mumbai]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://karnatakasanghamumbai.com/index.html |title=Karnataka Sangha Mumbai |publisher=Karnataka Sangha Mumbai |date= |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mallige Kannada Balaga ([[Mauritius]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=115832 |title=Mallige Kannada Balaga: Spreading Fragrance of Karnataka in Mauritius |publisher=Daijiworld.com |date= |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; North America Vishwa Kannada Association (NAVIKA) and [[Association of Kannada Kootas of America]] (AKKA) in the United States have promoted cultural involvement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TNN 5 January 2002, 11.05pm IST |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-01-05/bangalore/27109946_1_akka-kannada-cassettes |title=AKKA to host world Kannada meet in US from September 2 |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=5 January 2002 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; through events such as [[Kannadotsava]].

===The post 1947 Scene===
During the period of [[British Raj|British rule]], state of Karnataka as it stands today did not exist. Areas that today comprise Karnataka were under as many as 20 different administrative units with the [[Kingdom of Mysore|princely state of Mysore]], [[Hyderabad state|Nizam's Hyderabad]], the [[Bombay Presidency]], the [[Madras Presidency]] and the territory of [[Kodagu]] being the most important ones. In effect, nearly two-thirds of what is now Karnataka fell outside the rule of the [[Wodeyar|Wodeyar kings of Mysore]]. In addition the proposed state had six neighbours &amp;mdash; [[Goa]], [[Maharashtra]], Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, [[Kerala]] &amp;mdash; and all had Kannadigas along the borders overlapping these regions.

What this meant for the Kannadigas in these regions was that they were reduced to linguistic minorities wherever they were. Kannadigas in the Hubli-Karnataka region for example, came under the rule of the Bombay presidency where [[Marathi language|Marathi]] was the official language. Those in the Hyderabad-Karnataka region came under the Nizam's rule where [[Urdu]] ruled, while in Mysore Kingdom, Kannada was the official language.

It was in this backdrop that the movement that first started as a protest against linguistic oppression, soon morphed into one that began demanding a separate state be created consolidating all Kannada speaking regions. This was essentially a movement that was spearheaded by the poets, journalists and writers and was called the ''Ekikarana'' or 'Unification' movement.
India gained independence in 1947. The joy of independence soon gave way to disappointment as the new government started dragging its feet on ''Karnataka Ekikarana'' movement. Kannada speaking areas now got grouped under five administrative units of the Bombay and Madras provinces, Kodagu, and the princely states of Mysore and Hyderabad. The ''Akhila Karnataka Ekikarana Parishat'' met in [[Kasaragod Town|Kasargod]] and reiterated the demand for a separate state for Kannadigas.

The ratification in parliament of the recommendations of the [[Fazal Ali Committee]] brought joy to the Kannadiga population that now was merged under the state of [[Mysore State|Mysore]].

On 1 November 1973, under [[Devaraj Urs]] as chief minister, Mysore state was renamed as Karnataka since it was felt that Karnataka was more 'inclusive' of all the other regions of Karnataka than the name Mysore.

Kannada unification organisations currently active include:
*[[Karnataka Vidyavardhaka Sangha]]
*Karnataka Ekikarana Samithi
*[[Karnataka Rakshana Vedike]]
*[[Kannada Chalavali Vatal Paksha]]

==Kannada ethnic flag==
[[File:GBerunda.JPG|thumb|60px|right|[[Gandaberunda|Karnataka Emblem]]]]
[[File:Flag_of_Karnataka.svg|thumb|left|100px|[[Kannada flag|Karnataka Popular Flag]]]]
The [[Kannada flag|Kannada ethnic flag]] is a banner with two horizontal stripes, yellow on top and red on the bottom. The flag neither is official nor represents any legendary empire but has become accepted in recent times representing a symbol of culture and welfare.The flag was first conceived by Ma Ramamurthy, a Bangalore-based writer, journalist and social activist, often considered as a commander of Kannada movement in 1960s.

Their character depends on the country.

*The notion of [[landed gentry]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] varied over time.&lt;ref name="Thompson2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=F.M.L. Thompson|title=English Landed Society in the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aa5lAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-82853-2|pages=44–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Russian Empire]] landed nobles were called ''pomeshchiks'', with the term  literally translated as "[[landed estate]] owner". See [[Russian nobility]] for more.
*[[Junker]]s  were the landed nobility of [[Prussia]] and Eastern [[Germany]]
*Landadel were landed nobility of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]
*In Poland, ''[[szlachta]]'' were usually landowners, with [[magnate]]s being the class of the wealthiest ''szlachta''. Middle and smaller landed szlachta was called ''[[:pl:ziemiaństwo|ziemiaństwo]]/ziemianie'' (from the word ''ziemia'', land), usually translated as [[landed gentry (Poland)|landed gentry]].
*In some places, e.g., in [[Low Countries]] before Spanish rule, urban nobility with [[landed estate]]s was distinct from landed nobility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/ren/publications/journal/ten/shaw.doc Study Day on the Landed Nobility and the City in Renaissance Europe]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, University of Warwick, 17 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In general, relations between landed nobility and towns was very complex in [[Europe]].
*In the [[Indian Empire]], [[jagirdar]] and [[zamindar]] were the landed aristocracies, which formed [[Indian feudalism]]. Sometimes, they were elevated to the status of 'princes' or 'royalty' owning [[princely state]]s. Sometimes royal status was also reduced to the status of zamindars. In the south, [[Nairs]] constituted the landed gentry and owned vast amounts of land spread out in current day Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
*In the [[Philippines]], the [[Principalía]] was the ruling and usually educated upper class in the towns of the [[Spanish Philippines]]. The distinction or status of being part of the principalía was a hereditary right. This upper class was exempted from tribute (tax) to the Spanish crown during the colonial period. The principales (members of the principalía) traced their origin from the pre‑colonial royal and noble class of [[Datu]] and [[Lakan]] of the established kingdoms, rajahnates, confederacies, and principalities, as well as the lordships of the smaller ancient social units called [[barangays]] in [[Visayas]], [[Luzon]], and [[Mindanao]]. The members of this class enjoyed exclusive privileges, including the right to vote, be elected to public office, and be addressed by the title: [[Don (honorific)|Don]] or [[Doña]].
*Within certain communities in [[Nigeria]], the reigning monarchs (known as the [[Nigerian traditional rulers|traditional rulers]]) are often vested with inalienable landownership due to their positions, with them either owning tracts of land outright or holding them in trust for their [[List of Nigerian traditional states|states]]. Some communities don't follow this pattern, however. In the [[Lagos, Nigeria|Kingdom of Lagos]], for example, landownership is not traditionally vested in the [[Oba of Lagos]], who is descended from later immigrants from the [[Kingdom of Benin]], but is instead vested in the so-called ''Idejo'' class of titled aristocrats, who all claim descent from the earliest [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] settlers of Lagos. Some of the more powerful of them have even risen to become subordinate obas under the overlordship of the Oba of Lagos due to this fact. Elsewhere, in [[Egbaland]], the ''[[Egba Alake]]'' ruling section of the Egba Yorubas is typically considered to be the landowning segment of the clan. Both the ruler, the [[Alake of Egba (title)|Alake of Egba]]land, and the most powerful [[Ogboni]] aristocrats, the ''Omo-Iya-Marun'', have to belong to families from this section.

In order to facilitate organized, determined, and principled opposition to the wars, people have often founded [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] organizations. These groups range from temporary coalitions which address one war or pending war, to more permanent structured organizations which work to end the concept of war and the factors which lead to large-scale destructive conflicts. The overwhelming majority do so in a nonviolent manner. The following '''list of anti-war organizations''' highlights past and present anti-war groups from across the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1534">'''Mesne''' (an Anglo-French legal form of the O. Fr. ''meien'', mod. ''moyen'', mean, Med. Lat. ''medianus'', in the middle, cf. English ''[[mean]]''), middle or intermediate, an adjective used in several [[legal]] phrases.

* A [[mesne lord]] is a [[landlord]] who has [[Tenement (law)|tenants]] holding under him, while himself holding of a superior lord. Similar ideas are [[subinfeudation]] and [[subcontractor|subcontract]]. 
* Mesne process was such process as intervened between the beginning and end of a suit.
* [[Mesne profits]] are profits derived from land while in wrongful possession, and may be claimed in damages for [[trespass]], either in a separate action or joined with an action for the recovery of the land. The [[plaintiff]] must prove that he has re-entered into possession, his title during the period for which he claims, the fact that the [[defendant]] has been in possession during that period, and the amount of the mesne profits. The amount recovered as mesne profits need not be limited to the [[rental]] value of the land, but may include a sum to cover such items as deterioration or reasonable costs of getting possession.

==Placenames==
*Mesnes Park in [[Newton-le-Willows]], [[Merseyside]]

In [[Greater Manchester]], there are several places with "Mesne" in the name
*Mesne Lea in [[Worsley]]
*[[Mesnes Park, Wigan|Mesnes Park]] in [[Wigan]]
*[[Worsley Mesnes]] in Wigan

"Tennessee man pleads guilty to Asheville airport bomb charges". ''The Charlotte Observer'' (Charlotte, North Carolina). p. 8A.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Incident==
Estes put an explosive device outside the entrance to the baggage claim area of Asheville Regional Airport after midnight on October 6, 2017.&lt;ref name= TNman/&gt; The explosive device was made of nails, a shotgun shell, and an explosive material of [[ammonium nitrate]] and [[fuel oil]] in a [[Mason jar]].&lt;ref name= TNman/&gt; Estes wrote "For God &amp; Country" on the strike strip of a matchbox attached to the explosive device, and he wrote "For All the V/N Vets Out There!!!" on tape attached to the device.&lt;ref name= TNman/&gt; Attached to the device was a clock with an alarm positioned at 6 o'clock, but the alarm was not set.&lt;ref name= TNman/&gt; The bomb did not go off.&lt;ref name= TNman/&gt; When the airport's police were alerted to the suspicious bags, the police evacuated the baggage claim area, and bomb technicians were able to disarm the device.&lt;ref name= TNman/&gt; In the woods near the airport, law enforcement also found an [[REI]] backpack that Estes had left.&lt;ref name= npr&gt;Domonoske, Camila (October 13, 2017). "Suspect In Would-Be Airport Bombing Nabbed With Help From REI". ''National Public Radio''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the backpack, Estes had put gloves, fuel, a roll of tape, and an alarm clock bell that matched the one in the bag near the baggage area.&lt;ref name= npr/&gt; 

The backpack was tracked to a local REI store.&lt;ref name= npr/&gt; Estes had paid in cash, but he had used his REI [[loyalty card]], which had his name linked to it.&lt;ref name= npr/&gt; After a photograph of Estes from [[surveillance camera]]s was circulated, police officers from Asheville Police Department found Estes by a Walmart near the airport the next day, and he was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-man-left-jar-filled-with-explosive-chemicals-nails-at-north-carolina-airport FBI: Man left jar filled with explosive chemicals, nails at North Carolina airport]".

''Citizen-Times''. Retrieved October 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After being arrested, Estes claimed he had planted the device at the airport to train law enforcement about how explosive devices were made so they would be prepared to fight terrorists that he said were coming to the United States to wage war.&lt;ref name= TNman/&gt;

==Conviction==
Estes was charged with attempted malicious use of explosive materials and unlawful possession of explosive materials in an airport.&lt;ref name= charges&gt;"[https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4107228-Michael-Christopher-Estes-Criminal-Complaint.html United States of America v.

October 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Estes [[guilty plea|pleaded guilty]] to one count of unlawful possession of explosive material on January 12, 2018.&lt;ref name= TNman/&gt;

==Reactions==
Civil rights activist [[Shaun King]], writing in ''[[The Intercept]]'', said that the lack of media attention was because the suspect was white.&lt;ref name="theintercept"&gt;[[Shaun King|King, Shaun]] (October 11, 2017).

The '''Neihsial''' is an ethnic group found in [[Northeast India|northeastern]] India.&lt;ref&gt;and parts of [[Myanmar]].{{cite web|author=Esel Neihsial |url=http://singngil.blogspot.in/2012/08/who-are-neihsial.html?m=1 |title=SINGNGIL: Who Are Neihsial? |publisher=Singngil.blogspot.in |date=2012-08-25 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this group are largely concentrated in the [[Churachandpur district|Churachandpur]], [[Senapati district|Senapati]],  [[Chandel district|Chandel]] District and Tamenglong district of the Indian state of [[Manipur]]. There is also a sizable population in the neighboring [[Chin State]] of [[Burma|Myanmar]].

The Neihsial speak a Tibeto-Burman language which is unique and different from the [[Vaiphei people|Vaiphei]] and [[Gangte people|Gangte]] tribal dialects. Some of the Neihsial are scattered among the Vaiphei, Gangte, [[Paite people|Paite]] and [[Thadou people|Thadou]] tribes in India, where as a large number of significant proportion speak the Neihsial dialect and followed its traditions. The word Neihsial is being spell in various variations such as Neihsiel and Neihsel due to others dialects and literature influences.&lt;ref&gt;Neihsial, Mung, "Neihsial", p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the Neihsial are not recognized as a tribe in India. Instead, the Neihsial are classified under the nomenclature [[Zo people|ZOUMI and KUKI]]

The Neihsial practice a subsistence form of agriculture, Jhum or [[slash-and-burn]] cultivation.

==Origin==
The meaning associated behind the word “Neihsial” is a combination of the words: 'neih' means to have/possess or owned and 'sial' means mithun(name of animal) or to boast . Scholars believe that the name was derived from the phrase "Owner of many mithun" or “boasting of wealth.”.&lt;ref&gt;Pa Gho Khan Dal, Guite Khang Thu, Kalemyo, April,1986, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; As is the case with other neighboring tribes, the genesis of Neihsial cannot be effectively traced and produced, due to the lack of written historical evidence. However, mentions were made by many other researchers of which mention be made by the ''Lotjem clan of the Thadou speaking tribe describing  the Neihsial Pa (pa stand as father/man) as "Sakhaupi Kuohpa" which means a man with a big pouch. Through the local traditions and oral traditions it was known that the cruelties and hardships their ancestor suffered in the Kale-Chindwinvalley at the hands of the Kawls (Burmans) were so severe that it led to the first wave of migration straight into the Arakans in about the year A.D. 1,000. The second wave moved over to the Chin hills during A.D. 1200–1400 taking shelter in whatever shelter was available—tick woods, crests of rocks and even caves, and they referred to one such big cave where they took shelter known as khuul.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Neihsial Tualchin, “The Origin and Early History of the Zoumis from Kawlzang Settlement to Occupation of
Chin Hills”, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neihsial tribe is a composition of "''bawngthum"'' meaning three groups of clans namely The Nunthuk clans, The Tungling Clans and the Haulai clans. The Nunthuk group consist of the Nunthuk clans, Thaanhing clans, Thukneel clans, Thaanvuum clans, Thuklai clans and Chiljaang clans. The Tungling group consist of the Tungling clan, Singtou clan, Singbul clan, Singlul clan, Daalvung clan, Santou clan, Timtong clan, Tuolkhen clan, Dolbak clan, Banlawng clan, Aikhoh clan, Khuptong clans - Kipging clan, Ngaithuom clan, Bawngmei clan, Lamthang clan, Sumai clan and Bianpi clan. The Haulai group consist of Haulai clans- Kimdeih clan, Chonmang clan, Ngalkip clan, Lengen clan and Thahgen clan with two more undiscovered clans from Haulai sept. 

The Neihsial people wander among the other tribes (Thadou, Paite, Vaiphei, Gangte, Hmar, Mizo, Zou etc.) after the destruction of the Sialgam (''Sialthah-tuithang gam''),  consisting of the two capitals Sialthah Kulhpi and Tuithang Kulhpi. The region under the Sialthah Kulhpi was called Sialthahgam and the region under Tuithang Kulhpi was called Tuithanggam. The Neihsial people speak a unique language called ''Neihsial Pau''. Neihsial people living in and around Churachandpur District and Tamenglong District of Manipur still use ''Neihsial Pau''.

==Religion==
The traditional religion of the Neihsial ( ''i.e VOKPI DAWI'' ) is a combination of [[Veneration of the dead|ancestor worship]] and [[animism]]. The Neihsial believed in the existence of a supreme deity whom they called “Pathian”. Besides Pathian, the Neihsial revered and feared a number of supernatural beings. Sacrifices of [[fowl]]s, [[pig]]s, [[dog]]s and [[goat]]s were made to appease the [[deity|deities]]. The important traditional festivals of the Neihsial include Sa-ai, Gallu-ai and Lawmzu nek. Above all the Neihsial tribe practice "VOKPI DAWI LAAM" Which is the supreme of all their traditional religious dance.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Dr. Neihsial, Tualchin: ''History and Culture of the Zomi'', 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The most important and unique festival of the Neihsial tribe was "SIAL-KUT". This very ''SIAL-KUT'' is unique and is famous for its role in the socio-religious life of the people.During the late 19th and early 20th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs Stephen: ''The Aboriginal tribes of [[India]]'', 1982, pp. 10–25&lt;/ref&gt;foreign missionaries, mostly from the [[Western world]], converted many Neihsials to [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis G.R: ''The Story of Lushai Pioneer Mission'', 1907, pp. 11–77&lt;/ref&gt; They began to abandoned the traditional believes and faiths and discarded all kinds of traditional religions and worships.

By the 20th century, the Neihsial Christian Association (NCA) was formed on May 11, 1989, at Neihsial Veng, Lamka, Churachandpur, Manipur. At its young stage, they were under the Manipur Christian Organization (MCO). After some years they formed alignment with the Wesleyan Methodist Church for about seven years. After parting from Methodist Church they reorganize NCA and function independently till these day. The denominational headquarters of NCA is at Neihsial Veng itself. They believe in trinity: the father, the son and the Holy Spirit. The NCA is headed by one executive secretary, who is assisted by clerk and choukider. There is an executive committee to deal with any important matters concerning with the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Neihsial, Mung, Op. Cit., p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tinneinieng, “A Brief Ethnographic Study of the Neihsials”, 2004, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral values of the Neihsial==
The Neihsial [[society]] is [[patriarchy|patriarchal]]. It is [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] and [[Patrilocal residence|patrilocal]] with a focus on the [[extended family]]. In the Neihsial society, it is a traditional practice that husband and wife never use each other's proper names as a sign of respect. Children also never use their parents' names. The parents are addressed as "Pa" (father) and "Nu" (Mother). The father and mother of another family are addressed by elders in the name of their eldest child, preceded by "Pa" or "Nu".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Neo-expressionism''' is a style of [[Late Modernism|late modernist]] or early-[[Postmodern art|postmodern]] painting and sculpture that emerged in the late 1970s. Neo-expressionists were sometimes called ''[[Transavantgarde]]'', ''[[Junge Wilde]]'' or ''Neue Wilden'' ('The new wild ones'; 'New Fauves' would better meet the meaning of the term). It is characterized by intense subjectivity and rough handling of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-expressionism developed as a reaction against [[conceptual art]] and [[minimal art]] of the 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in an [[abstract art|abstract]] manner), in a rough and violently emotional way, often using vivid colors. It was overtly inspired by [[German Expressionist]] painters, such as [[Emil Nolde]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[George Grosz]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[James Ensor]] and [[Edvard Munch]]. It is also related to American [[Lyrical Abstraction]] painting of the 1960s and 1970s, [[The Hairy Who]] movement in Chicago, the [[Bay Area Figurative School]] of the 1950s and 1960s, the continuation of [[Abstract Expressionism]], New Image Painting and precedents in [[Pop art|Pop Painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503-504&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

Neo-expressionism dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. The style emerged internationally and was viewed by many  critics, such as [[Achille Bonito Oliva]] and [[Donald Kuspit]], as a revival of traditional themes of self-expression in European art after decades of American dominance. The social and economic value of the movement was hotly debated.

Critics such as [[Benjamin Buchloh]], [[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]], [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]], and [[Mira Schor]] were highly critical of its relation to the marketability of painting on the rapidly expanding art market, celebrity, the [[anti-feminism|backlash against feminism]], [[anti-intellectualism]], and a return to mythic subjects and individualist methods they deemed outmoded. Women were notoriously marginalized in the movement, and painters such as [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]] and [[Maria Lassnig]] were omitted from many of its key exhibitions, most notoriously the 1981 "New Spirit in Painting" exhibition in London which included 38 male painters but no female painters.

'''Omagua''' is a Tupí-Guarani language closely related to [[Cocama language|Cocama]] (Michael to appear), belonging to the Group III subgroup of the [[Tupi-Guarani languages|Tupí-Guaraní family]], according to [[Aryon_Rodrigues|Rodrigues']] classification of the family. Alternate names for Omagua include: Agua, Anapia, Ariana, Cambeba, Cambeeba, Cambela, Campeba, Canga-Peba, Compeva, Janbeba, Kambeba, Macanipa, Omagua-Yete, Pariana, Umaua, Yhuata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical and modern distribution==

When Europeans first arrived in the western Amazon Basin in significant number in the late 17th and early 18th century, Omagua was spoken by approximately 100,000 individuals in two major areas: along the [[Amazon River|Amazon River proper]], between the mouths of the [[Napo River]] and [[Jutaí River]], and in the vicinity of the [[Aguarico River]], a tributary of the upper Napo River. At this time, then, Omagua speakers lived in regions corresponding to modern eastern Peruvian Amazonia, western Brazilian Amazonia, and eastern Ecuadoran Amazonia.

These Omagua populations were decimated by disease, Portuguese slave raids, and conflicts with Spanish colonial authorities during the early 18th century, leaving them drastically reduced. As of 2011, Omagua was spoken by "fewer than ten elderly individuals" in Peru,&lt;ref name = "ucberkeley"&gt;{{Cite web
| title = Omagua: Documentation and Sociohistorical Analysis

| accessdate = 2013-08-21
| url = http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/research/
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by a number of semi-speakers near the town of Tefé in Brazil, where the language is known as '''Cambeba''' (Grenand and Grenand 1997).

==Genesis of Omagua ==

Comparative work by Cabral (1996) demonstrated that Omagua (and its sister language Cocama) exhibit significant grammatical restructuring effects due to intense language contact between a Tupí-Guaraní language and speakers of one or more non-Tupí-Guaraní languages. Rodrigues and Cabral (2003) further suggest that Cocama (and by extension, Omagua) could be considered the outcomes of rapid creolization. Cabral (1996) argued that this language contact transpired in the late 17th century in [[Jesuit]] mission settlements, while Michael&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabeceras.org/ldm_publications/JLC_submission_l_michael_precolumbian_pok.pdf Michael, Lev . 2014. "On the Pre-Columbian Origin of Proto-Omagua-Kokama." ''Journal of Language Contact'' 7(2):309{344.]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the language contact situation responsible for the genesis of Omagua and Cocama transpired during the Pre-Columbian period.

The terms '''party conference''' (UK English), '''political convention''' (US English), and '''party congress''' usually refer to a general meeting of a political party. The conference is attended by certain delegates who represent the party membership. In most political parties, the party conference is the highest decision-making body of the organization, tasked with electing or nominating the party's leaders or leadership bodies, deciding party policy, and setting the party's platform and agendas. 

''The term '''conference''' or '''caucus''' may also refer to the organization of all party members as a whole.''

The definitions of all of these terms vary greatly, depending on the country and situation in which they are used.

==Leadership roles==

*''Chairmanship'' &amp;mdash; Chosen from within the body's membership to preside over its business.
*''Secretary'' &amp;mdash; Responsible for keeping minutes of the conference's proceedings. 
*''Policy committees'' &amp;mdash; Responsible for setting and maintaining review of current party policy, and preparing proposals for presentation to the full conference.


==Party conferences around the world==
=== Canada ===
{{main|leadership convention}}
In Canada, besides annual or biennial conventions, parties often hold special conventions to elect new leaders.

===Communist states===
*Communist parties convene a ''congress'' to elect a [[Central Committee]], which in turn sets up a [[Politburo]]. 
* A Communist ''conference'' may also meet on occasion, to discuss a particular issue or plan an event, but would have no such official powers.

=== Ireland ===
* [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Irish Labour Party]] has an annual Party Conference at which party policy is decided by the membership and the Party Chairperson and Executive Board are elected.

=== United Kingdom ===
* British Labour Party conference elects the [[National Executive Committee]].
* Unique to the UK, the Liberal Democrat Party Conference decides party policy, voted on by the membership.

===United States===
{{main|Political convention}}

In the United States, the term ''party conference'' is used to refer to the equivalent of [[parliamentary group]]s in other countries.

==Russian Empire==
===Origin===
The original "Russia for Russians" idea has variously been ascribed to a [[Black Hundreds]] ideologue [[Vladimir Gringmut]], to General [[Mikhail Skobelev]] (1843-1882), or to [[Tsar]] [[Alexander III of Russia]] (1845-1894). Gringmut authored one of the first publications to use the slogan. He proclaimed "Russia for Russian" as a slogan of the Russian Monarchist Party, which, he wrote, "clearly sees that if Russia is left to the people of alien stock and religion, and to foreigners, – not only will not be the Autocracy, but Russia herself." Another version attributes the notion to Alexander III, who declared that "Russia should belong to Russians, and all others dwelling on this land must respect and appreciate this people".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} According to General [[Aleksey Kuropatkin]], Alexander chose "Russia for Russians" as his watchword. General Skobelev is also reported to have said that "I want to inscribe on my banner: 'Russia for Russians and in a Russian way,' and raise this flag as high as possible!"&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} Ivanov, A.

In the last decades of the 19th century, some Russian political movements proposed reclassifying "Russia" as an ethnic or even as a racial category. They advocated "Russia for Russia" and believed that Russians deserved more rights than other nationalities in their "own empire" as they had established and maintained the state in the first place. Such exclusive nationalists denounced non-Russians as grossly ungrateful for the benefits they had received from Russian rule.&lt;ref&gt;Tuminez, Astrid S. (2000), Russian Nationalism Since 1856, p. 127. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, {{ISBN|0-8476-8884-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although these sentiments caught the minds of some intellectuals in the latter part of the 19th century, right-wing xenophobic organizations originated during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], when political parties were finally legalized. They made "Russia for the Russians" their battle cry, yet were determined to preserve "one and united Russia" through the [[Russification]] of the non-Russians.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Baycroft, Mark Hewitson (2006), What is a Nation?, p. [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-929575-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first hostile "other" to be targeted were the [[Jews]], and "Russia for Russians" was soon augmented with the slogan "Beat up the [[Yid]]s and save Russia!".&lt;ref name="Kaufmann"&gt;Eric P. Kaufmann (2004), Rethinking Ethnicity: Majority Groups and Dominant Minorities, pp. 138-9. Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-31542-5}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
From the very beginning, the slogan and the idea of the empire ruled by Russians was very controversial regarding what “Russians” meant. One of the outspoken critics of the notion, [[Pavel Milyukov]], leader of the [[Constitutional Democratic Party]], considered the “Russia for Russians” slogan to have been “a slogan of disunity… [and] not creative but destructive.”&lt;ref&gt;Kirschke, Melissa (1996), Paul Miliukov and the quest for a liberal Russia, 1880-1918, p. 189. Cornell University Press, {{ISBN|0-8014-3248-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, Milyukov addressed the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire|Russian State Duma]] on the issue of using [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] in the court system, attacking Russian nationalist deputies: “You say “Russia for Russians,” but whom do you mean by “Russian”? You should say “Russia only for the [[Great Russia]]ns,” because that which you do not give to [[Muslim]]s and Jews you also do not give your own nearest kin – [[Ukraine]].”&lt;ref&gt;Plokhy, Serhii (2005), Unmaking Imperial Russia: Mykhailo Hrushevsky and the Writing of Ukrainian History, pp. 462-3, n. 64. University of Toronto Press, {{ISBN|0-8020-3937-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Another notable politician, Prime Minister [[Sergei Witte]], warned Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] against his flirtation with these ideas because it would disrupt the delicate ethnic balance in the Russian state.&lt;ref name="Kaufmann"/&gt; The slogan was also rejected by the moderate nationalist [[Nikolai Berdyaev]] who viewed it as “pagan nationalism” and contrasted it with the [[Messianism|messianist]] “Christian nationalist” notion “Russia for the World”.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} Pustarnakov, V.F. (200), Университетская философия в России, p. 201. Directmedia Publishing, {{ISBN|5-88812-184-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition from protagonists of a multi-ethnic empire like Witte and indifference of most Russian workers and peasants of pre-[[World War I]] Russia to such sentiments rendered the project of a Russian [[ethnocracy]] abortive without even being properly launched.&lt;ref name="Kaufmann"/&gt;

[[File:Russian March 2008.jpg|thumb|Demonstration of the Russian nationalists in Moscow]]
The notion "Russia for Russians" resurfaced again later in the 1980s when the [[Radical nationalism in Russia|ultra-nationalist]] [[Pamyat]] staged a series of demonstrations and passed out handbills that read "Russia for Russians!" and "Death to the Yids!".&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Martin A. (1999), The Beast Reawakens, p. 306. Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|0-415-92546-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the outbreak of a [[Second Chechen War|second war in Chechnya]] in 1998 and growing antipathy to "strangers" in Russia after [[Vladimir Putin]]'s advent to power, the proportion of those who subscribe to the maxim "Russia for Russians" began to increase, partly as a reaction to the crisis and instability and uncertainty of the 1990s as well as growing public discontent with the influx of migrants from [[Central Asia]], the [[South Caucasus]], and [[China]]. Thus, the overall number of its supporters rose from 46% in 1998 to 58% in 2005.&lt;ref name="Gudkov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lipsky, Andrei (2008-09-03), [http://en.novayagazeta.ru/data/2008/63/06.html Photofit of the Russian average citizen: Xenophobia].

In 2003, during a television broadcast with President of Russia, random Russians on the streets asked him questions. One of the elderly man asked [[Vladimir Putin]] what his and [[United Russia|his party]]'s stance on "Russia for Russians" slogan was. Putin responded that those who shout and act upon such slogan are "either idiots or provocateurs" (придурки либо провокаторы), who "don't understand what they do and shout". Putin also mentioned that such people want to weaken Russian Federation, composed of many nations and cultures, by inciting racial and national hatred which ultimately would lead to the Federation's dissolvement. Putin also warned that the law enforcement agencies should act as soon as possible against such people who threaten public order.&lt;ref&gt;[ Путин:"Россия для русских-говорят придурки либо провокаторы"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPka_VHSuYM]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 opinion poll published by the independent [[VCIOM|Russian Public Opinion Research Center]] (VCIOM), 34% of the respondents approved the slogan on the proviso that by "Russians" is meant all citizens of the Russian Federation, 23% said they would not object to the idea if implemented within "reasonable limits", 20% (mostly in [[Moscow]] and [[St. Petersburg]]) believed the realization of this concept – without any restrictions – was long overdue. The notion was disapproved of by 23%, of whom 12% feared difficulties with the West, and 11% of whom described it as "true fascism". At the same time, supporters of the slogan diverged regarding what "Russians" meant – all those who had been brought up in Russian traditions (39%), those who labored for Russia (23%), only Russians "by blood" (15%), those who spoke Russian as a native language (12%), or [[Russian Orthodox]] Christians (7%).&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://wciom.ru/arkhiv/tematicheskii-arkhiv/item/single/3772.html Россия для русских или для всех?]. [[VCIOM]] Press-release № 603. 2006-12-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights groups have implicated the sentiment as translating into violence against foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Bigg, Claire (2005-10-25), [http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1062399.html Russia: Hate Crime Trial Highlights Mounting Racism]. [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Brod]], director of the [[Moscow Bureau for Human Rights]] (MBHR), has argued that polling data indicate that 60% of Russia's adult population adheres to an ideology he has described as "Russia for Russians and all misfortune is from non-Russians." [[Lyudmila Alexeyeva]], chairwoman of the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]], has accused the top Russian officials of promoting the notion. She cited as an example [[Krasnodar Krai|Krasnodar]] governor [[Aleksandr Tkachyov (politician)|Aleksandr Tkachyov]], who has vowed to drive "the aliens and dissenters" out of his region.&lt;ref&gt;Gurin, Charles (2004-10-27), [http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=401&amp;issue_id=3121&amp;article_id=2368753 Russian media mulls growing ethnic intolerance]. Eurasia Daily Monitor, Volume 1, Issue 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The MBHR published, in 2005, a report monitoring xenophobia during the Moscow local elections and argued that a number of political parties adhered to xenophobic slogans, such as "Russia for Russians" and "Russian faces in the Russian capital", in their election campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Jerome (2005-11-27), [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/foreign-students-scared-to-leave-their-homes-after-stabbings-in-st-petersburg-520756.html Foreign students scared to leave their homes after stabbings in St Petersburg]. [[The Independent]].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Rodina (political party)|Rodina]] party and its leader [[Dmitry Rogozin]] made illegal immigration and a "Moscow for Muscovites!" platform a centerpiece of their election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov, Eugene (2005-10-17), [http://www.russiaprofile.org/page.php?pageid=CDI+Russia+Profile+List&amp;articleid=2755 The rise and fall of President Putin’s “spetsnaz”]. Russia Profile.&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation ordered by a Russian court concluded that slogan "Russia for Russians" does not fuel ethnic hatred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echo.msk.ru/blog/echomsk/616307-echo/#comments Russian Original of the conclusion by expert Kirukhina]&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation was conducted in connection with a case of assaulting a [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian]] teenage migrant from [[Dagestan]] who was almost killed near his school. The attackers shouted "Russia for Russians!",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echo.msk.ru/news/615862-echo.html Echo of Moscow]&lt;/ref&gt; while beating the boy.

On 28 July 2010, a court in Russia demanded an [[ISP]] block access to [[YouTube]] because the site hosted "Russia for Russians", which is considered by many to be an extremist video.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2010/07/28/youtube-banned-russia/ YouTube Banned in Russia Over Racist Video]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also as of recently Russia has passed a law allowing them to remove websites from anywhere without the need for a court order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sweb1.dmit.nait.ca/~npetlock1/xenophobic-modern-czar/ Xenophobic Modern Czar || Vladimir Putin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The bank was founded in 1999 by [[Roustam Tariko]] owner of the [[Russian Standard Corporation]], as a means of circumventing new laws which banned the advertising of alcohol in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/undertheinfluence/season-1/2012/01/07/a-new-bric-in-the-wall/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315174233/http://www.cbc.ca/undertheinfluence/season-1/2012/01/07/a-new-bric-in-the-wall/ |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It dominates the consumer finance sector in Russia, and has over 54 percent control of the credit card market and over 30 percent control of the point of sale loan market. It is ranked among the best-profit-on-capital financial institutions in the world. The bank employs 25,000 people across its organization.&lt;ref name=russianstandard&gt;[http://www.russianstandard.com/financial_services/banking/ Banking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401222523/http://www.russianstandard.com/financial_services/banking |date=2010-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian Standard Bank has a presence in more than 1,800 cities in Russia.&lt;ref name=russianstandard/&gt; Its distribution network covers 93% of the Russian population. Russian Standard Bank is also the exclusive issuer of [[American Express]] branded credit cards in Russia.&lt;ref name=russianstandard/&gt;

Russian Standard Bank issues cards of five leading international payment systems in Russia: [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[American Express]], [[Diners Club International]], [[Discover Card]], and acquires seven payment systems: [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[American Express]], [[Diners Club International]], [[Discover Card]], [[China Union Pay]], [[Japan Credit Bureau]] and [[Zolotaya Korona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbr.ru/credit/coinfo.asp?id=450000359 The Central Bank of the Russian Federation]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207053359/http://www.cbr.ru/credit/coinfo.asp?id=450000359 |date=2013-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   

On December 2010 Russian Standard Bank and the international payment system [[Diners Club International]] have entered into an agreement for settlement transactions of the payment system in the Russian Federation. Under the Agreement, Russian Standard Bank will process settlement transactions of other banks acting as acquirers of [[Diners Club]] in the Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianstandardbank.com/news/2413/ DINERS CLUB INTERNATIONAL CHOOSES JSC RUSSIAN STANDARD BANK AS THE CORE SETTLEMENT BANK OF DINERS CLUB RUSSIA® FOR OPERATIONS IN RUSSIA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520104329/http://www.russianstandardbank.com/news/2413/ |date=2015-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Bank’s portfolio of card brands was enriched with a partnership with [[Discover Financial]], offering one of the most popular credit cards among American consumers – [[Discover card]]s – in Russian market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investorrelations.discoverfinancial.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=204177&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1731294&amp;highlight= Discover Financial Services and Russian Standard Bank Announce Discover Card Issuance in Russia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710161755/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-02/vodka-billionaire-bank-bonds-at-risk-on-russia-consumer-distress |date=2016-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, Russian Standard Bank, [[Miles &amp; More]] and [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] announced the signing of a long-term agreement.

'''Shenwa''', also spelt '''Chenoua''' (native name: ''Haqbaylit̠''), is a [[Zenati languages|Zenati]] [[Berber language]] spoken on [[Mount Chenoua]] (Jebel Chenoua) in [[Algeria]], just west of [[Algiers]], and in the provinces of [[Tipaza Province|Tipaza]] (including the town of [[Cherchell]]) and [[Chlef Province|Chlef]]. The speech of Jebel Chenoua proper is [[mutually comprehensible]] with that of the nearby Beni Menacer and [[Beni Haoua]],&lt;ref&gt;Laoust 1912:I&lt;/ref&gt; and the two are thus treated as a single language.&lt;ref&gt;Salem Chaker, [http://www.centrederechercheberbere.fr/chenoua.html LE DIALECTE BERBERE DU CHENOUA (Algérie)], ''Encyclopédie Berbère'', vol. XII, 1993 : p. 1902-1904.&lt;/ref&gt; There are some 76,000 speakers.&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt;

==Phonology==
Judging by Laoust (whose work on the language predates systematic [[phonology]]), Shenwa has the following sounds, which are given below in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] along with differing representations in the Algerian standard Latin orthography for Berber languages in angle brackets {{angbr| }}:

Comparison with other Berber languages suggests that Laoust's transcription may have failed to distinguish certain sounds, notably pharyngealized {{IPA|/zˤ/}}.

===Vowels===

{{IPA|/a/, /i/, /u/, /ə/}} {{angle bracket|e}}. Laoust's {{angbr|o}} appears to variously indicate [[labialization]] ({{IPA|/ʷ/}}) or an allophone of /u/.

==Grammar==

===Nouns===

Masculine nouns start with ''a-, i-, u-'' (in the singular) – like all Berber languages – or more rarely with a consonant (often corresponding to ''a-'' in other languages.)  Examples: ''ayḏi'' "dog"; ''fus'' "hand"; ''iri'' "neck"; ''urṯu'' "garden".  Their plural is usually in ''i-...-en'' (e.g. ''ameţin'' "death" → ''imeţinen''), but a variety of other plural forms (e.g. ''i-...-an'', ''i-...-wen'', ''i-...awen'', ''i-...-en'', ''i-...-a-''), sometimes accompanied by internal [[ablaut]], are also found: e.g. ''ijiḏer'' "eagle" → ''ijuḏar'', ''iṯri'' "star" → ''iṯran'', ''afer'' "wing" → ''ifrawen'', ''icer'' "fingernail" → ''icaren''.

Feminine nouns start with ''h-'' (originally ''t-''), and usually end with ''-t'' or ''-ṯ'': ''hagmarṯ'' "mare", ''hesa'' "liver".  A few feminine nouns have lost the ''h-'': ''malla'' "turtledove".  A masculine noun can be made [[diminutive]] by adding the feminine affixes: ''afus'' "hand" → ''hafust'' "little hand".  The plurals of feminine nouns fall into much the same types as masculine ones, but adding ''h-'' at the beginning and using ''-in'' rather than ''-en'': ''hakṯemţ'' "female" → ''hikṯemin'', ''harract'' "girl" → ''harracin'', ''huqiṯ'' "stone" → ''huqay'', ''hawleliṯ'' "spider" → ''hiwlela''.

Genitive constructions – English "X of Y" or "Y's X" – are formed as "X Y", in which the prefix of Y changes to ''u-'' (masc.) or ''n ţe-'' (fem.).  Thus, for instance: ''aman n ţala'' "the water of the fountain", ''aglim uγilas'' "the skin of the panther".  ''n'' "of" is also used with foreign words: ''hagmarṯ n elqayd̠'' "the mare of the [[Qaid|Caid]]".

===Adjectives===

Adjectives agree in number and gender with the noun, and are formed in the same way: e.g. ''amellal'' "white", ''azegrar'' "long", ''azaim'' "good".  The particle ''d̠'' is used before adjectives in certain contexts (including as a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]]), in the same way as in the [[Kabyle language]].

===Numbers===
As in Kabyle, only the first two numbers are Berber; for higher numbers, Arabic is used.  They are ''iğ'' (f. ''ict'') "one", ''sen'' (f. ''senat̠'') "two".  The noun being counted follows it in the genitive: ''senat̠ n ţuwura'' "two doors".

"First" and "last" are respectively ''amezgaru'' and ''aneggaru'' (regular adjectives).  Other ordinals are formed with the prefix ''wis'' (f. ''his''): ''wis sen'' "second (m.)", ''his t̠elat̠a'' "third (f.)", etc.

===Pronouns===
The basic personal pronouns of Shenwa are as follows.  Gender is distinguished in all cases except the first person.

The basic demonstrative adjectives are ''-a'' "this" (also ''-ay, -ad̠''; ''-ax'' for middle distance), ''-in'' "that", ''-enni'' "the aforementioned".  The demonstrative pronouns include:

*"this": ''wa'' m. sg., ''hax'' f. sg., ''yid̠a'' m. pl., ''hid̠a'' f. pl.
*"this" (emphatic): ''wayek'', ''hayek'', ''id̠ad̠ik'', ''hid̠ad̠ik''
*"this" (in question): ''wenni'', ''henni'', ''id̠enni'', ''hid̠enni''
*"that": ''win'', ''hin'', ''yid̠in'', ''hid̠in''

The standalone [[possessive pronouns]] ("mine", "yours", etc.) are formed by [[Affix|suffixing]] the possessive pronouns to "this" (except that ''ha-'' is used instead of ''hax''.)  Similarly, the adjective "other" (invariable ''enniḍen'') combines with "this" to make forms meaning "the other": ''unniḍen'', ''henniḍen'', ''id̠enniḍen'', ''hid̠enniḍin''.

The main interrogative pronouns are: ''maţa'' "what?", ''manţ'' "which", ''manay'' "who?",  ''mi lan'' "whose?", ''miked̠'' "with whom?", ''mid̠eg'' "in what?", ''mizeg'' "with what?", ''mifeg'' "on what?", ''miγer'' "at/for whom?"

The relative pronoun is ''i'' "which".

Indefinite pronouns include ''yeğ'' (f. ''yectenţ'') "one, someone", ''cra'' "something".  Negative forms are made using the Arabic loanword ''haţa'' (حتى); ''haţa d̠ yeğ'' "no one", ''haţa d̠ elḥabb'' "nothing".

===Verbs===

The [[declarative mood]] is divided into two tenses: [[preterite]] (past) and [[aorist]] (non-past, formed by the addition of ''a-''.)  There is also an imperative mood.  The irregular imperative ''ia'' "come" is used with the aorist to form imperatives of the first person: ''iaw annaroḥet̠'' "let's go".  The pronoun affixes for these are given under Pronouns. The declarative mood is also accompanied by ablaut:

* Verbs whose imperative consists of two consonants or less (e.g. ''eğ'' "eat", ''eγr'' "read", ''ezr'' "see", ''enγ'' "kill") add ''-a'' to the stem in the 3rd person singulars and 1st person plural, and ''-i'' in all other forms: ''enγiγ'' "I killed", ''henγa'' "she killed".
*Verbs whose imperative begins with ''a-'' (e.g. ''adef'' "come in", ''ad̠er'' "go down", ''azen'' "send") change it to ''u-'': thus ''ud̠efen'' "they came in", ''hud̠efed'' "you (sg.) came in. (Verbs such as ''af'' "find" belong to both this and the previous group.)  ''awi'' "bring" and ''awd̠'' "arrive" are exceptions, changing ''a-'' to ''i-'': ''yiwi'' "he brought".
* Verbs with ''-a-'' in the middle (e.g. ''laz'' "be hungry", ''nam'' "have the habit of", ''ğal'' "judge") change it to ''-u-'': ''elluzeγ'' "I was hungry".
* Verbs with a final vowel usually behave like the two-consonant ones: ''arji'' "dream" → ''ourjiγ'' "I dreamt", ''yurja'' "he dreamt"; ''egmi'' "teach" → ''egmiγ'' "I taught", ''igma'' "he taught".  But there are exceptions: ''erni'' "be born" → ''irni'' "he was born".

The participle is formed by adding ''-n'' to the 3rd person m. sg., sometimes with [[ablaut]] of final vowels: ''inziz'' "he sang" → ''inzizen''; ''ayenziz'' "he will sing" → ''ayenzizen'', ''yut̠a'' "he hit" → ''yut̠in''.

The verb is negated by adding ''u... c'' around it: ''u ţinziz ec'' "don't sing", ''u huwired̠ ec'' "you didn't walk".  "Not yet" is ''u rt̠uci εad̠'' or ''ur uci'', where ''rt̠uci'' and ''uci'' are verbs conjugated in the appropriate person: ''u rt̠uciγ εad̠ u d yuḍeγ ec'' "I haven't arrived yet", ''u hert̠ucid̠ εad̠ ...'' "you haven't yet..."

Derived verb forms include:
* a [[causative]] in ''s-'': ''azeg'' "boil" → ''sizeg'' "make something boil".
* a "reciprocal" [[middle voice]] in ''m-'': ''zer'' "see" → ''mzer'' "be seen"
* a [[grammatical voice|passive voice]] in ''ţwa-'': ''abba'' "carry" → ''ţwabba'' "be carried".
* Various habitual forms.

Continuous forms can be formed with ''aql-'' "see X" in the present tense, ''ţuγa'' "was" in the past tense: ''aqlay ţeţeγ'' "I am eating", ''ţuγay ţeţeγ''"I was eating".

===Prepositions===

[[Prepositions]] precede their objects: ''i medden'' "to the people", ''sgi Bazar'' "from Tipaza".  Some of the main ones are: ''i'' "to" ([[dative]]), ''n'' "of", ''d̠eg/d̠i/eg/i'' "in(to)", ''seg/zeg-/si'' "from", ''s'' "using" ([[instrumental]]), ''f/fell-'' "on", ''γer/γ'' "towards", ''akid̠/d̠'', "with", ''jar'' "among", ''zat̠'' "in front of", ''awr'' "behind", ''i sawen/susawen'' "under", ''addu'' "over".

===Conjunctions===

[[Grammatical conjunction|Conjunction]]s precede the verb: ''ami yiwoḍ ''"when he arrived", ''qabel ma ţaγen'' "see if it's raining".  Some important ones include: ''melmi'' "when?", ''ami'', ''γassa(l)'', ''assγa'', ''γir'' "when", ''ma'', ''kagella'', ''lukan'', ''willa'' "if", ''(an)neγ'' "or".

==Sample text==

''Qaren midden: Unni ayḥağen d̠ug ass, adeffeγen arraw ennes d̠iferd̠asen.''

They say: he that tells stories in the daytime, his children will turn bald.

''Ţḥağen γir d̠eg iḍ''

They only tell stories at night.

===Uccen aked̠ waḥzaw/The jackal and the child===

''Iğ wuccen iroḥ iggur lami g ufa iğ waḥzaw iţellem i hezra.  Innas uccen i warrac enni: "Maţa hellid̠ hegared̠."  Arrac enni innas: "Ţellemeγ d̠i hezra."  Innas uccen: "Ad̠el ay hirkasin."  Arrac enni iţxiyeḍ as iḍaren nes.  Lami iqaḍa innas: "Roḥ, aεd̠el iḍaren ennek̠ γer fwit̠."''

''Iroḥ uccen yaεd̠el iman es γer fwit̠ lami eqqoren iḍaren u iğim ec ayuwr.''

''Ikk ed sin iğ wumcic; innas uccen: "Sellek ay u c eţţγec."  Iks as umcic hazra seg ḍarennes.  Iroḥ uccen iwalla γer waḥzaw ič as elkul iγeṭṭen.''

A jackal went and met a child plaiting a rope.  The jackal asked the child: "What are you doing?"  This child replied: "I'm plaiting a rope."  The jackal said: "Make me some shoes."  This child tied up his feet.  When he was done he told him: "Go show your feet in the sun."

The jackal went and showed his own feet in the sun, and his feet dried and he couldn't walk.

A cat arrived and the jackal told it: "Help me, I won't eat you."  The cat took the rope off his feet.  The jackal went back to the child, and ate all his goats.

They are predominantly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]].&lt;ref name="Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi"/&gt; Ethnic Somalis number around 28-30 million and are principally concentrated in [[Somalia]] (around 15 million),&lt;ref name="UNFPA Somali Population Survey 2017"&gt;https://population.un.org/wpp/DataQuery/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethiopia]] (8.5 million),&lt;ref&gt; http://www.csa.gov.et/ehioinfo-internal &lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenya]] (2.4 million),&lt;ref name="Kengov"/&gt; and [[Djibouti]] (534,000).&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/country/DJ/status] – Ethnologue.com&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Somali diaspora]] is also found in parts of the [[Middle East]], [[African Great Lakes]] region, [[Southern Africa]], [[North America]], [[Oceania]], and [[Western Europe]].

==Etymology==
[[Samaale]], the oldest common ancestor of several [[Somali clan]]s, is generally regarded as the source of the [[ethnonym]] ''Somali''. The name "Somali" is, in turn, held to be derived from the words ''soo'' and ''maal'', which together mean "go and milk" — a reference to the ubiquitous [[pastoralism]] of the Somali people.&lt;ref&gt;I. M. Lewis, ''A pastoral democracy: a study of pastoralism and politics among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa'', (Oxford University Press : 1963), p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; Another plausible [[etymology]] proposes that the term ''Somali'' is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] for "wealthy" (''dhawamaal''), again referring to Somali riches in livestock.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=I. M.|author2=Said Samatar|title=A Pastoral Democracy: A Study of Pastoralism and Politics Among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa|publisher=LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster|year=1999|pages=11–13|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=L2vXPfRsf04C| isbn = 3-8258-3084-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the ethnonym ''Somali'' is believed to have been derived from the Automoli (Asmach), a group of warriors from [[ancient Egypt]] described by [[Herodotus]], who were likely of [[Meshwesh]] origin according to [[Flinders Petrie]]. ''Asmach'' is thought to have been their Egyptian name, with ''Automoli'' being a Greek derivative of the Hebrew word ''Semoli'' (meaning "on the left hand side").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the East Africa and Uganda Natural History Society, Issues 24-30|date=1926|publisher=The Society|page=103|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=vwccAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient Chinese]] document from the 9th century CE referred to the northern Somalia coast — which was then part of a broader region in [[Northeast Africa]] known as [[Barbara (region)|Barbara]], in reference to the area's [[Berbers|Berber]] ([[Hamitic]]) inhabitants&lt;ref name="Laitin"&gt;David D. Laitin, Said S. Samatar, ''Somalia: Nation in Search of a State'', (Westview Press: 1987), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; — as ''Po-pa-li''.&lt;ref&gt;Lee V. Cassanelli, ''The shaping of Somali society: reconstructing the history of a pastoral people, 1600-1900'', (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1982), p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;Nagendra Kr Singh, ''International encyclopaedia of Islamic dynasties'', (Anmol Publications PVT. LTD., 2002), p.524.&lt;/ref&gt; The first clear written reference of the sobriquet ''Somali'', however, dates back to the 15th century. During the [[Abyssinian–Adal war|conflict]] between the [[Sultanate of Ifat]] based at [[Zeila]] and the [[Solomonic Dynasty]], the Abyssinian [[Emperor of Ethiopia|emperor]] had one of his court officials compose a [[hymn]] celebrating a military victory over the [[Sultan]] of Ifat's eponymous troops.&lt;ref&gt;I.M. Lewis, ''A modern history of the Somali: nation and state in the Horn of Africa'', 4, illustrated edition, (James Currey: 2002), p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Simur'' was also an ancient [[Harari people|Harari]] alias for the Somali people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fage|first1=J.D|title=The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 3|date=1975|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GWjxR61xAe0C&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=simur+harari&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjm8efm7crSAhUn54MKHfK0AewQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=simur%20harari&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient [[Cave painting|rock paintings]], which date back 5000 years, have been found in the northern part of Somalia. These engravings depict early life in the territory.&lt;ref name="Dawn"/&gt; The most famous of these is the [[Laas Geel|Laas Geel complex]]. It contains some of the earliest known [[rock art]] on the [[Africa|African continent]] and features many elaborate pastoralist sketches of animal and human figures. In other places, such as the northwestern [[Dhambalin]] region, a depiction of a man on a horse is postulated as being one of the earliest known examples of a mounted huntsman.&lt;ref name="Dawn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/04/26/grotto-galleries-show-early-somali-life.html|title=Grotto galleries show early Somali life|author=AFP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Epigraphy|Inscriptions]] have been found beneath many of the rock paintings, but [[archaeologist]]s have so far been unable to decipher this form of ancient writing.&lt;ref&gt;Susan M.

In [[ancient history|antiquity]], the ancestors of the Somali people were an important link in the Horn of Africa connecting the region's commerce with the rest of the ancient world. Somali sailors and merchants were the main suppliers of [[frankincense]], [[myrrh]] and [[spice]]s, items which were considered valuable luxuries by the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaeans]] and [[Babylon]]ians.&lt;ref&gt;Phoenicia pg 199&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Aromatherapy Book by Jeanne Rose and John Hulburd pg 94&lt;/ref&gt;

According to most scholars, the ancient [[Land of Punt]] and its native inhabitants formed part of the [[ethnogenesis]] of the Somali people.&lt;ref&gt;Egypt: 3000 Years of Civilization Brought to Life By Christine El Mahdy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ancient perspectives on Egypt By Roger Matthews, Cornelia Roemer, University College, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Africa's legacies of urbanization: unfolding saga of a continent By Stefan Goodwin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Civilizations: Culture, Ambition, and the Transformation of Nature By Felipe Armesto Fernandez&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Puntites were a nation of people that had close relations with [[Pharaoh|Pharaonic Egypt]] during the times of [[Pharaoh]] [[Sahure]] and [[Queen regnant|Queen]] [[Hatshepsut]]. The [[Architecture of Somalia|pyramidal structures]], temples and ancient houses of [[masonry|dressed stone]] littered around Somalia are said to date from this period.&lt;ref name="Man, God and Civilization pg 216"&gt;Man, God and Civilization pg 216&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Classical antiquity|classical era]], the [[Macrobians]], who may have been ancestral to the Automoli or ancient Somalis, established a powerful tribal kingdom that ruled large parts of modern [[Somalia]]. They were reputed for their longevity and wealth, and were said to be the "tallest and handsomest of all men".&lt;ref name="Wheeler pg 526"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/geographyofherod00whee/geographyofherod00whee_djvu.txt The Geography of Herodotus: Illustrated from Modern Researches and Discoveries] by James Talboys Wheeler, pg 1xvi, 315, 526&lt;/ref&gt; The Macrobians were warrior herders and seafarers. According to Herodotus' account, the [[Persian Emperor]] [[Cambyses II]], upon his [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|conquest of Egypt]] (525 BC), sent ambassadors to Macrobia, bringing luxury gifts for the Macrobian king to entice his submission. The Macrobian ruler, who was elected based on his stature and beauty, replied instead with a challenge for his Persian counterpart in the form of an unstrung bow: if the Persians could manage to draw it, they would have the right to invade his country; but until then, they should thank the gods that the Macrobians never decided to invade their empire.&lt;ref name="Wheeler pg 526"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kitto2"&gt;John Kitto, James Taylor, ''The popular cyclopædia of Biblical literature: condensed from the larger work'', (Gould and Lincoln: 1856), p.302.&lt;/ref&gt; The Macrobians were a regional power reputed for their advanced architecture and [[gold]] wealth, which was so plentiful that they shackled their prisoners in golden chains.&lt;ref name="Kitto2"/&gt;

After the collapse of Macrobia, several ancient city-states, such as [[Opone]], [[Essina]], [[Sarapion]], [[Nikon (Somalia)|Nikon]], [[Malao (ancient)|Malao]], [[Damo, Somalia|Damo]] and [[Mosylon]] near [[Cape Guardafui]], which competed with the [[Sabaeans]], [[Parthia]]ns and [[Aksumite Empire|Axumites]] for the wealthy [[South Asia|Indo]]-[[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] trade, also flourished in Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;Oman in history By Peter Vine Page 324&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ifat.png|thumb|left|The [[Ifat Sultanate]]'s realm in the 14th century.]]
The [[History of Islam|birth of Islam]] on the opposite side of Somalia's [[Red Sea]] coast meant that Somali merchants, sailors and [[expatriate]]s living in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] gradually came under the influence of the new religion through their converted [[Arab]] [[Muslim]] trading partners. With the migration of fleeing Muslim families from the [[Islamic world]] to Somalia in the early centuries of [[Islam]], and the peaceful conversion of the Somali population by [[Islam in Somalia|Somali Muslim scholars]] in the following centuries, the ancient city-states eventually transformed into Islamic [[Mogadishu]], [[Berbera]], [[Zeila]], [[Barawa]], [[Hafun]] and [[Merca]], which were part of the Berberi civilization. The city of Mogadishu came to be known as the ''City of Islam'',&lt;ref&gt;Society, security, sovereignty and the state in Somalia - Page 116&lt;/ref&gt; and controlled the East African gold trade for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;East Africa: Its Peoples and Resources - Page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sultanate of Ifat]], led by the [[Walashma dynasty]] with its capital at [[Zeila]], ruled over parts of what is now eastern Ethiopia, Djibouti, and northern Somalia. The historian [[Al-Omari|al-Umari]] records that Ifat was situated near the [[Red Sea]] coast, and states its size as 15 days travel by 20 days travel. Its army numbered 15,000 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers. Al-Umari also credits Ifat with seven "mother cities": Belqulzar, Kuljura, Shimi, [[Shewa]], Adal, Jamme and Laboo.&lt;ref&gt;[[G.W.B. Huntingford]], ''The Glorious Victories of Ameda Seyon, King of Ethiopia'' (Oxford: University Press, 1965), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Middle Ages]], several powerful Somali empires dominated the regional trade including the [[Ajuran Sultanate]], which excelled in [[hydraulic engineering]] and [[fortress]] building,&lt;ref&gt;Shaping of Somali society Lee Cassanelli pg.92&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Adal Sultanate]], whose general [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] (Ahmed Gurey) was the first [[commander]] to use cannon warfare on the continent during Adal's conquest of the [[Ethiopian Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;Futuh Al Habash Shibab ad Din&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sultanate of the Geledi]], whose military dominance forced governors of the [[Oman|Omani empire]] north of the city of [[Lamu]] to pay tribute to the Somali Sultan [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]].&lt;ref&gt;Sudan Notes and Records - Page 147&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Harla people|Harla]], an early [[Hamitic]] group of tall stature who inhabited parts of Somalia, Tchertcher and other areas in the Horn, also erected various [[tumulus|tumuli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joussaume|first1=Roger|title=Fouille d'un tumulus à Ganda Hassan Abdi dans les monts du Harar|journal=Annales d'Ethiopie|date=1976|volume=10|pages=25–39|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/ethio_0066-2127_1976_num_10_1_1157|accessdate=10 March 2017|doi=10.3406/ethio.1976.1157}}&lt;/ref&gt; These masons are believed to have been ancestral to the Somalis ("proto-Somali").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Braukämper|first=Ulrich|title=Islamic History and Culture in Southern Ethiopia: Collected Essays|url=http://www.google.com/books?id=HGnyk8Pg9NgC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2002|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-5671-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Martello Tower-Berbera.png|thumb|19th century Martello forts in Berbera constructed by Haji [[Sharmarke Ali Saleh]]]]
In 1841, Haji [[Sharmarke Ali Saleh]], a successful and ambitious Somali merchant, successfully invaded Zeila utilizing canons and Somali Musketeers, he deposed and imprisoned the port town's Arab ruler and succeeded him as the undisputed ruler of Zeila and its dependencies. Sharmarke's governorship had an instant effect on the city, as he maneuvered to monopolize as much of the regional trade as possible, with his sights set as far as Harar and the Ogaden. In 1845, Sharmarke deployed a few matchlock men to wrest control of neighboring Berbera from that town's then feuding Somali authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Abir, Mordechai (1968).

Among his allies were the Sultans of Shewa. When there was tension between the Amir of Harar [[Abu Bakr II ibn `Abd al-Munan]] and Sharmarke, as a result of the Amir arresting one of his agents in [[Harar]], Sharmarke persuaded the son of [[Sahle Selassie]], ruler of [[Shewa]], to imprison on his behalf about 300 citizens of Harar then resident in Shewa, for a length of two years.&lt;ref name=Burton-176&gt;Burton, ''First Footsteps'', pp. 176 and note&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, after the [[Berlin conference]] had ended, European empires sailed with their armies to the Horn of Africa. The imperial clouds wavering over Somalia alarmed the [[Dervish state|Dervish]] leaders [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] and [[Nur Ahmed Aman|Sultan Nur Ahmed Aman]], who gathered Somali soldiers from across the Horn of Africa and began one of the longest anti-colonial [[resistance movement|wars]] ever.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Department-External-B, August 1899, N. 33-234, NAI, New Delhi, Inclosure 2 in No. 1.

The incident in question was that of a group of Somali children that were converted to Christianity and adopted by the French Catholic Mission at Berbera in 1899. Whether Sultan Nur experienced the incident first hand or whether he was told of it is not clear but what is known is that he propagated the incident in June 1899, precipitating the religious rebellion that later morphed into the Somali Dervish.&lt;ref&gt;F.O.78/5031, Sayyid Mohamad To The Aidagalla, Enclosed Sadler To Salisbury. 69, 20 August 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Dervish State|Dervish movement]] successfully repulsed the [[British empire]] four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of African history - Page 1406&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of its successes against the British, the Dervish movement received support from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[German empire]]s.

Ofcansky, Historical dictionary of Ethiopia, (The Scarecrow Press, Inc.: 2004), p.405&lt;/ref&gt; After a quarter of a century of holding the British at bay, the Dervishes were finally defeated in 1920, when Britain for the first time in Africa used [[airplane]]s to bomb the Dervish capital of [[Taleex]]. As a result of this bombardment, former Dervish territories were turned into a [[protectorate]] of Britain.

[[Majeerteen Sultanate]] was founded in the early-18th century. It rose to prominence in the following century, under the reign of the resourceful Boqor (King) [[Osman Mahamuud]].&lt;ref name="Metz"&gt;Helen Chapin Metz, ''Somalia: a country study'', (The Division: 1993), p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; His Kingdom controlled Bari Karkaar, Nugaaal, and also central Somalia in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Majeerteen Sultanate maintained a robust trading network, entered into treaties with foreign powers, and exerted strong centralized authority on the domestic front.&lt;ref name="HOA"&gt;''Horn of Africa'', Volume 15, Issues 1-4, (Horn of Africa Journal: 1997), p.130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSP"&gt;''Transformation towards a regulated economy'', (WSP Transition Programme, Somali Programme: 2000) p.62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Majeerteen Sultanate was nearly destroyed in the late-1800s by a power struggle between Boqor (King) [[Osman Mahamuud]] of the Majeerteen Sultanate and his ambitious cousin, [[Yusuf Ali Kenadid]] who founded a separate Kingdom, [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] in 1878. Initially Kenadid wanted to seize control of the neighbouring Majeerteen Sultanate, ruled by his cousin Mahamuud. However, he was unsuccessful in this endeavour, and was eventually forced into exile in [[Yemen]]

In late 1888, Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid entered into a treaty with the Italian government, making his Sultanate of Hobyo an Italian [[protectorate]] known as [[Italian Somaliland]]. His rival Boqor Osman Mahamuud was to sign a similar agreement vis-a-vis his own Majeerteen Sultanate the following year. In signing the agreements, both rulers also hoped to exploit the rival objectives of the European imperial powers so as to more effectively assure the continued independence of their territories.&lt;ref name="Issa-Salwe"&gt;{{cite book |first=Abdisalam M. |last=Issa-Salwe |authorlink=Abdisalam Issa-Salwe|title=The Collapse of the Somali State: The Impact of the Colonial Legacy|pages=34–35|publisher=Haan Associates |year=1996|isbn=187420991X|url=http://www.google.com/books?id=GxMOAQAAMAAJ}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italians, for their part, were interested in the  territories mainly because of its [[port]]s specifically Port of [[Bosaso]] which could grant them access to the strategically important [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Gulf of Aden]].&lt;ref name=Fitz-33&gt;Fitzgerald, Nina J.

Following [[World War II]], Britain retained control of both [[British Somaliland]] and [[Italian Somaliland]] as [[protectorate]]s. In 1945, during the [[Potsdam Conference]], the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland, but only under close supervision and on the condition — first proposed by the [[Somali Youth League]] (SYL) and other nascent Somali political organizations, such as Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali (HDMS) and the Somali National League (SNL) — that Somalia achieve independence within ten years.&lt;ref name = "Zolberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gates1999&gt;Gates, Henry Louis, ''Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience'', (Oxford University Press: 1999), p.1749&lt;/ref&gt; British Somaliland remained a protectorate of Britain until 1960.&lt;ref name=Tripodi1999&gt;Tripodi, Paolo.

[[File:General Kediye.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant Colonel [[Salaad Gabeyre Kediye]], the "Father of the Revolution" initiated by the [[Supreme Revolutionary Council (Somalia)|Supreme Revolutionary Council]].]]

To the extent that Italy held the territory by UN mandate, the trusteeship provisions gave the Somalis the opportunity to gain experience in political education and self-government. These were advantages that British Somaliland, which was to be incorporated into the new [[Somali Republic]] state, did not have. Although in the 1950s British colonial officials attempted, through various administrative development efforts, to make up for past neglect, the protectorate stagnated. The disparity between the two territories in economic development and political experience would cause serious difficulties when it came time to integrate the two parts.&lt;ref name=ChapinMetz&gt;Helen Chapin Metz, ed.

A [[French Somaliland overseas territory referendum, 1958|referendum]] was held in neighboring [[Djibouti]] (then known as [[French Somaliland]]) in 1958, on the eve of Somalia's independence in 1960, to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, largely due to a combined yes vote by the sizable [[Afar people|Afar]] ethnic group and resident Europeans.&lt;ref name=Barrington2006/&gt; There was also widespread [[vote rigging]], with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls.&lt;ref name="Kseoah"&gt;Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African history'', (CRC Press: 2005), p.360.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of those who voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia, as had been proposed by [[Mahmoud Harbi]], Vice President of the Government Council.

On 20 July 1961 and through a popular [[referendum]], the people of Somalia ratified a new [[constitution]], which was first drafted in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Greystone Press Staff, ''The Illustrated Library of The World and Its Peoples: Africa, North and East'', (Greystone Press: 1967), p.338&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, [[Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal]] became Prime Minister, a position to which he was appointed by Shermarke. Egal would later become the President of the autonomous [[Somaliland]] region in northwestern Somalia.

On 15 October 1969, while paying a visit to the northern town of [[Las Anod]], Somalia's then President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was shot dead by one of his own bodyguards. His assassination was quickly followed by a military [[coup d'état]] on 21 October 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the [[Military of Somalia|Somali Army]] seized power without encountering armed opposition — essentially a bloodless takeover. The putsch was spearheaded by Major General [[Siad Barre|Mohamed Siad Barre]], who at the time commanded the army.&lt;ref name="Myswenvwp"&gt;Moshe Y. Sachs, ''Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Nations'', Volume 2, (Worldmark Press: 1988), p.290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside Barre, the [[Supreme Revolutionary Council (Somalia)|Supreme Revolutionary Council]] (SRC) that assumed power after President Sharmarke's assassination was led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Salaad Gabeyre Kediye]] and Chief of Police [[Jama Korshel]].

The revolutionary army established large-scale public works programs and successfully implemented an urban and rural [[literacy]] campaign, which helped dramatically increase the literacy rate. In addition to a nationalization program of industry and land, the new regime's foreign policy placed an emphasis on Somalia's traditional and religious links with the [[Arab world]], eventually joining the [[Arab League]] (AL) in 1974.&lt;ref name="Frankel"&gt;Benjamin Frankel, ''The Cold War, 1945–1991: Leaders and other important figures in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, and the Third World'', (Gale Research: 1992), p.306.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Barre also served as chairman of the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU), the predecessor of the [[African Union]] (AU).&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;Oihe Yang, ''Africa South of the Sahara 2001'', 30th Ed., (Taylor and Francis: 2000), p.1025.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pan-Somalism==
{{Main|Somali nationalism}}
&lt;!-- Pan-Somalism is ethnic not civic nationalism --&gt;
[[Somali nationalism]] is centered on the notion that Somalis in [[Greater Somalia]] share a common language, religion, culture and ethnicity, and as such constitute a nation unto themselves. The ideology's earliest manifestations are often traced back to the resistance movement led by [[Mohamed Abdullah Hassan]]'s [[Dervish State|Dervish revolt]] at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi. ''Culture and Customs of Somalia''. Westport, Connecticut, Greenwood Publishing Group, Inc, 2001. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In northwestern present-day [[Somalia]], the first Somali nationalist political organization to be formed was the Somali National League (SNL), established in 1935 in the former [[British Somaliland]] [[protectorate]]. In the country's northeastern, central and southern regions, the similarly-oriented Somali Youth Club (SYC) was founded in 1943 in [[Italian Somaliland]], just prior to the [[Trust Territory of Somalia|trusteeship period]]. The SYC was later renamed the [[Somali Youth League]] (SYL) in 1947. It became the most influential political party in the early years of post-independence Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi. ''Culture and Customs of Somalia''. Westport, Connecticut, Greenwood Publishing Group, Inc, 2001. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madrasah|Qur'anic schools]] (also known as ''dugsi'') remain the basic system of traditional religious instruction in Somalia. It is delivered in Arabic. They provide Islamic education for children. According to the [[UNICEF]], the ''dugsi'' system where the content is based on [[Quran]], teaches the greatest number of students and enjoys high parental support, is oftentimes the only system accessible to Somalis in nomadic as compared to urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/files/2011_Somalia_-_Integrated_Quranic_Schools_Evaluation_Final_-_Aug_2011.pdf pages The Integrated Quranic Schools Pilot Project: The Strategic Partnership for Recovery and Development of Education in Somalia], United Nationa Children Funds, UNICEF Somalia Support Centre (2011), 6-10&lt;/ref&gt; A study from 1993 found, among other things, that "unlike in primary schools where gender disparity is enormous, around 40 per cent of Qur'anic school pupils are girls; but the teaching staff have minimum or no qualification necessary to ensure intellectual development of children."

==Clan, family and social stratification==
{{Main|Demographics of Somalia}}

===Clans===
[[File:Darod2.JPG|thumb|Tomb of Sheikh [[Darod]] in [[Haylaan]].]]
Somalis are ethnically of [[Hamitic]] ancestry, but have genealogical traditions of descent from various [[Arabs|Arabian]] patriarchs associated with the spread of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I. M.|title=A Pastoral Democracy: A Study of Pastoralism and Politics Among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa|date=1999|publisher=James Currey Publishers|isbn=0852552807|page=11|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=eK6SBJIckIsC&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are segmented into various [[clan]] groupings, which are important [[kinship]] units that play a central part in Somali culture and politics. Clan families are [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]], and are divided into clans, primary lineages or subclans, and [[Diyya|dia]]-paying kinship groups. The lineage terms ''qabiil'', ''qolo'', ''jilib'' and ''reer'' are often interchangeably used to indicate the different segmentation levels. The clan represents the highest kinship level. It owns territorial properties and is typically led by a clan-head or [[Sultan]]. Primary lineages are immediately descended from the clans, and are exogamous political units with no formally installed leader. They comprise the segmentation level that an individual usually indicates he or she belongs to, with their founding patriarch reckoned to between six and ten generations.&lt;ref name="Lewis1999vvii"/&gt;

The five major clan families are the traditionally nomadic pastoralist [[Darod]], [[Dir (clan)|Dir]], [[Hawiye]] and [[Isaaq]], and the sedentary agropastoralist [[Rahanweyn]]&lt;ref name="Lewis1999vvii"/&gt; Minor Somali clans include [[Benadiri people|Benadiri]].&lt;ref name="Abdullahi8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abdullahi|first=Mohamed Diriye|title=Culture and Customs of Somalia|date=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0313313334|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Samaale and Sab are supposed to have ultimately descended from a common lineage originating in the Arabian peninsula.&lt;ref name="Lewis19991113"/&gt; These traditions of descent from elite Arab forefathers, who settled on the littoral, are debated, although they are based on early Arab documents and northern oral folklore.&lt;ref name="AppiahGates2010p395"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marian Aguiar|editor=Anthony Appiah and Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC| year=2010| publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somali clans, while fiercely egalitarian with regards to leadership and political control, contain divisions of unequal status".&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobles constituted the upper tier and were known as ''bilis''. They consist of individuals of ethnic Somali ancestral origin, and have been endogamous. The nobles are distinguished by [[Caucasian race|Europid]] physical features, different from those of [[negro]] Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Luling|first1=Virginia|title=The Social Structure of Southern Somali Tribes|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1317929/1/302018.pdf|publisher=University of London|pages=43–46|accessdate=15 November 2016|quote=One physical type is like that of the northern Somali and the other Cushitic speaking peoples.

===Marriage===
[[File:Wedding basket, Somali people, Somalia, 20th century, fiber, cloth, cowrie shells - National Museum of Natural History, United States - DSC00483.jpg|thumb|A traditional Somali wedding basket.]]
Among Somali clans, in order to strengthen alliance ties, marriage is often to another ethnic Somali from a different clan. According to I. M. Lewis, of 89 marriages initiated by men of the Dhulbahante clan, 55 (62%) were therefore with women of Dhulbahante subclans other than those of their husbands; 30 (33.7%) were with women of adjacent clans of other clan families (Isaaq, 28; Hawiye, 3); and 3 (4.3%) were with women of other clans of the Darod clan family (Majerteen 2, Ogaden 1).&lt;ref name="Lewis1994p51"/&gt;

Such [[exogamy]] is always followed by the dia-paying group and usually adhered to by the primary lineage, whereas marriage to lineal kin falls within the prohibited range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=I. M. Lewis|title=Blood and Bone: The Call of Kinship in Somali Society|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=9fAjtruUXjEC|year=1994|publisher=The Red Sea Press|isbn=978-0-932415-93-6|page=51|quote=The primary lineage is normally, and the dia-paying group always, exogamous, because these units are already so strongly united that marriage within them is considered to threaten their cohesion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These traditional strictures against consanguineous marriage ruled out the patrilateral first cousin marriages that are favored by Arab Bedouins and specially approved by Islam. These marriages were practiced to a limited degree by certain northern Somali subclans.&lt;ref name="Lewis1994p51"&gt;{{cite book|author=I. M. Lewis|title=Blood and Bone: The Call of Kinship in Somali Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9fAjtruUXjEC|year=1994|publisher=The Red Sea Press|isbn=978-0-932415-93-6|pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas inhabited by diverse clans, such as the southern Mogadishu area, endogamous marriages also served as a means of ensuring clan solidarity in uncertain socio-political circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=I. M. Lewis|title=Blood and Bone: The Call of Kinship in Somali Society|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=9fAjtruUXjEC|year=1994|publisher=The Red Sea Press|isbn=978-0-932415-93-6|pages=51|quote=in areas formerly characterized by clan heterogeneity, with people of different clans living together harmoniously and inter-marrying, marriage outside one's own clan became the exception rather than, as formerly, the rule. Indeed, in the devastated capital, Mogadishu, women who had married outside their own clan found themselves at a serious disadvantage, they and their children being disowned and left unprotected by both sets of kin. Insecurity required maximum clan solidarity, including now clan endogamy rather than exogamy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inclination was further spurred on by intensified contact with Arab society in the Gulf, wherein first cousin marriage was preferred. Although politically expedient, such endogamous marriage created tension with the traditional principles within Somali culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=I. M. Lewis|title=Blood and Bone: The Call of Kinship in Somali Society|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=9fAjtruUXjEC|year=1994|publisher=The Red Sea Press|isbn=978-0-932415-93-6|pages=51|quote=This new trend was further encouraged by the intensified contact with the Arab society, and its preference for cousin marriage, through the experience of labour migration in the Gulf. The tension between this politically expedient practice and traditional cultural precepts was reflected in the popular view that such endogamous marriage amounted to a kind of incest akin to the mating of animals.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the most prominent government reforms regarding [[family law]] in a [[Muslim World|Muslim country]] were set in motion in the [[Somali Democratic Republic]], which put women and men, including husbands and wives, on complete equal footing.&lt;ref&gt;Pg.115 - Women in Muslim family law by John L.

Benaadir (also known as Coastal Somali) is spoken on the [[Benadir]] coast from [[Adale]] to south of [[Merca]], including Mogadishu, as well as in the immediate hinterland. The coastal dialects have additional [[phoneme]]s which do not exist in Standard Somali. Maay is principally spoken by the Digil and Mirifle ([[Rahanweyn]]) clans in the southwestern areas of Somalia.&lt;ref name="Dalby"&gt;Andrew Dalby, ''Dictionary of languages: the definitive reference to more than 400 languages'', (Columbia University Press: 1998), p.571.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[writing system]]s have been used over the years for transcribing the Somali language. Of these, the [[Somali Latin alphabet]] is the most widely used, and has been the official writing script in Somalia since the government of former President of Somalia Mohamed Siad Barre formally introduced it in October 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Economist Intelligence Unit (Great Britain), ''Middle East annual review'', (1975), p.229&lt;/ref&gt; The script was developed by the Somali linguist [[Shire Jama Ahmed]] specifically for the Somali language. It uses all letters of the [[Latin alphabet]], except ''p'', ''v'', and ''z''. Besides the Latin script, other orthographies that have been used for centuries for writing Somali include the long-established [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic script]] and [[Wadaad writing]]. Other writing systems developed in the twentieth century include the [[Osmanya alphabet|Osmanya]], [[Borama alphabet|Borama]] and [[Kaddare alphabet|Kaddare]] scripts, which were invented by [[Osman Yusuf Kenadid]], [[Abdurahman Sheikh Nuur]] and [[Hussein Sheikh Ahmed Kaddare]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;David D. Laitin, ''Politics, Language, and Thought: The Somali Experience'', (University Of Chicago Press: 1977), pp.86-87&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Somali, [[Arabic]], which is also an Afro-Asiatic tongue, is an official national language in both Somalia and Djibouti. Many Somalis speak it due to centuries-old ties with the [[Arab world]], the far-reaching influence of the Arabic media, and religious education.&lt;ref name="Dubnov"&gt;Helena Dubnov, ''A grammatical sketch of Somali'', (Kِppe: 2003), pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Somalia and Djibouti are also both members of the [[Arab League]].&lt;ref name=2009factbook/&gt;&lt;ref name="SCT"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/dj.html CIA World Factbook - Djibouti - People and Society]; *N.B. ~60% of 774,389 total pop.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Culture of Somalia}}
{{Main|Culture of Somalia}}
[[File:Somtradanhd4.png|thumb|left|Somali young women and men performing the traditional ''[[dhaanto]]''.]]
The [[culture of Somalia]] is an amalgamation of traditions developed independently and through interaction with neighbouring and far away civilizations, such as other parts of [[Northeast Africa]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[India]] and [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="Abdullahi2"&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, ''Culture and Customs of Somalia'', (Greenwood Press: 2001), p.155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The textile-making communities in Somalia are a continuation of an ancient textile industry, as is the culture of [[wood carving]], [[pottery]] and [[Architecture|monumental architecture]] that dominates Somali interiors and landscapes. The cultural diffusion of [[Maritime history of Somalia|Somali commercial enterprise]] can be detected in its [[Somalian cuisine|cuisine]], which contains Southeast Asian influences. Due to the Somali people's passionate love for and facility with poetry, Somalia has often been referred to by scholars as a "Nation of Poets" and a "Nation of [[Bards]]" including, among others, the [[Canadians|Canadian]] novelist [[Margaret Laurence]].&lt;ref&gt;Diriye, p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these traditions, including [[festival]]s, [[Istunka|martial arts]], dress, literature, sport and games such as [[Shax (board game)|Shax]], have immensely contributed to the enrichment of Somali heritage.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Somalia}}
Somalis have a rich musical heritage centered on traditional Somali [[folklore]]. Most Somali songs are [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]]. That is, they only use five [[pitch (music)|pitches]] per [[octave]] in contrast to a [[Heptatonic scale|heptatonic]] (seven note) scale, such as the [[major scale]]. At first listen, Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia, [[Sudan]] or [[Arabia]], but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles. Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between [[lyricist]]s (''midho''), songwriters (''laxan'') and singers (''Codka'' or "voice").&lt;ref&gt;Diriye, pp.170-171&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema and theatre===
{{Main|Cinema of Somalia}}
[[File:Ali Said Hassan in a Event.png|thumb|upright|Somali film producer and director [[Ali Said Hassan]].]]
Growing out of the Somali people's rich storytelling tradition, the first few feature-length Somali films and cinematic festivals emerged in the early 1960s, immediately after independence. Following the creation of the [[Somali Film Agency]] (SFA) regulatory body in 1975, the local film scene began to expand rapidly. The Somali filmmaker [[Ali Said Hassan]] concurrently served as the SFA's representative in Rome. In the 1970s and early 1980s, popular musicals known as ''riwaayado'' were the main driving force behind the Somali movie industry. Epic and period films as well as international co-productions followed suit, facilitated by the proliferation of [[video]] technology and national television networks. [[Said Salah Ahmed]] during this period directed his first feature film, ''The Somali Darwish'' (''The Somalia Dervishes''), devoted to the Dervish movement. In the 1990s and 2000s, a new wave of more entertainment-oriented movies emerged. Referred to as [[Somaliwood]], this upstart, youth-based cinematic movement has energized the Somali film industry and in the process introduced innovative storylines, marketing strategies and production techniques. The young directors [[Abdisalam Aato]] of Olol Films and Abdi Malik Isak are at the forefront of this quiet revolution.&lt;ref name="Somaliwood"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hiiraan.com/news2/2007/may/somaliwood_columbus_has_become_a_haven_for_somali_filmmaking.aspx|title=Somaliwood: Columbus Has Become A Haven for Somali Filmmaking|publisher=The Other Paper|date=2007-04-19|accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
{{Main|Somali art}}
[[File:Ucidlhd29.png|thumb|left|A Somali woman with [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] eyes.]]
Somalis have old visual art traditions, which include pottery, jewelry and wood carving. In the medieval period, affluent urbanites commissioned local wood and marble carvers to work on their interiors and houses. Intricate patterns also adorn the [[mihrab]]s and [[Column|pillars]] of ancient Somali [[mosque]]s. Artistic carving was considered the province of men, whereas the textile industry was mainly that of women. Among the nomads, carving, especially [[woodwork]], was widespread and could be found on the most basic objects such as [[spoon]]s, [[comb]]s and [[bowl (vessel)|bowls]]. It also included more complex structures, such as the portable nomadic house, the ''aqal''. In the last several decades, traditional carving of windows, doors and furniture have given way to workshops employing electrical machinery, which deliver the same results in a far shorter time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abdullahi|first=Mohamed Diriye|title=Culture and Customs of Somalia|date=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0313313334|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[henna]] is an important part of Somali culture. It is worn by Somali women on their hands, arms, feet and neck during wedding ceremonies, [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]], [[Ramadan]] and other festive occasions. Somali henna designs are similar to those in the Arabian peninsula, often featuring flower motifs and triangular shapes. The palm is also frequently decorated with a dot of henna and the fingertips are dipped in the dye. Henna parties are usually held before the wedding takes place. Somali women have likewise traditionally applied [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] (''kuul'') to their eyes.&lt;ref name="Loughran"&gt;Katheryne S. Loughran, ''Somalia in word and image'', (Foundation for Cross Cultural Understanding: 1986), p.166.&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of the [[Eye liner|eye cosmetic]] in the Horn region is believed to date to the ancient Land of Punt.&lt;ref name="Stiant"&gt;''Studies in Ancient Technology'', Volume III, (Brill Archive), p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
{{main|Sports in Somalia}}
[[File:MoPodiumRio2016.png|thumb|[[Mo Farah]] the most decorated athlete in [[British athletics history]]]]
[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport amongst Somalis. Important competitions are the [[Somalia League]] and [[Somalia Cup]]. The [[Somalia national football team|Ocean Stars]] is Somalia's multi-ethnic national team.&lt;ref name="Nsyem"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Minahan|first1=James|title=The Complete Guide to National Symbols and Emblems|date=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=0313344973|page=909|url=http://www.google.com/books?id=jfrWCQAAQBAJ|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Basketball]] is also played in the country. The [[FIBA Africa Championship 1981]] was hosted in Mogadishu from 15 to 23 December December 1981, during which the [[Somalia national basketball team|national basketball team]] received the bronze medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1981 African Championship for Men|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/event/p/cid/AFMSM/sid/2399/_/1981_African_Championship_for_Men/index.html|publisher=FIBA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squad also takes part in the [[Basketball at the Pan Arab Games|basketball event]] at the [[Pan Arab Games]]. Other team sports include badminton, baseball, table tennis, and volleyball.&lt;ref name="Nsyem"/&gt;

In the [[martial arts]], [[Faisal Jeylani Aweys]] and [[Mohamed Deq Abdulle]] also took home a silver medal and fourth place, respectively, at the 2013 Open World [[Taekwondo]] Challenge Cup in [[Tongeren]]. The Somali National Olympic committee has devised a special support program to ensure continued success in future tournaments.&lt;ref name="Hsmfawt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia moves forward at world Taekwondo|url=http://horseedmedia.net/2013/03/06/somalia-moves-forward-at-world-taekwondo-pictures/|accessdate=19 October 2013|newspaper=Horseed Media|date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Mohamed Jama]] has won both world and European titles in [[K-1|K1]] and [[Muay Thai|Thai Boxing]].&lt;ref name="Gvfmikk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Great Victory for Malta in K1 Kickboxing|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2010-02-10/others/great-victory-for-malta-in-k1-kickboxing-270164/|accessdate=18 October 2013|newspaper=Malta Independent|date=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other individuals sports include judo, boxing, athletics, weight lifting, swimming, rowing, fencing and wrestling.&lt;ref name="Nsyem"/&gt;

Traditionally, Somali men typically wear the ''macawis''. It is a [[sarong]] that is worn around the waist. On their heads, they often wrap a colorful [[turban]] or wear the ''koofiyad'', which is an embroidered [[Fez (hat)|fez]].&lt;ref name="Abdullahi117"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abdullahi|first=Mohamed Diriye|title=Culture and Customs of Somalia|date=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0313313334|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Somalia's proximity to and close ties with the Arabian Peninsula, many Somali men also wear the [[jellabiya]] (''jellabiyad'' or ''qamiis''). The costume is a long white garment common in the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref name="Neasc"&gt;Michigan State University. Northeast African Studies Committee, ''Northeast African Studies'', Volume 8, (African Studies Center, Michigan State University: 2001), p.66.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Somali_woman_in_traditional_dress_Circa_1940.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Somali people|Somali]] woman in traditional ''Guntino''.]]
During regular, day-to-day activities, Somali women usually wear the ''guntiino''. It is a long stretch of cloth tied over the shoulder and draped around the waist. The cloth is usually made out of ''alandi'', which is a textile that is common in the Horn region and some parts of North Africa. The garment can be worn in different styles. It can also be made with other fabrics, including white cloth with gold borders. For more formal settings, such as at weddings or religious celebrations like Eid, women wear the ''dirac''. It is a long, light, diaphanous [[voile]] dress made of [[silk]], [[Chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]], [[taffeta]] or saree fabric. The gown is worn over a full-length [[Slip (clothing)|half-slip]] and a brassiere. Known as the ''gorgorad'', the underskirt is made out of silk and serves as a key part of the overall outfit. The dirac is usually sparkly and very colorful, the most popular styles being those with gilded borders or threads.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi117"/&gt;

Married women tend to wear [[Headscarf|headscarves]] referred to as ''shaash''. They also often cover their upper body with a [[shawl]], which is known as ''garbasaar''. Unmarried or young women, however, do not always cover their heads. Traditional Arabian garb, such as the [[Jilbāb|jilbab]] and [[abaya]], is also commonly worn.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi117"/&gt;

Additionally, Somali women have a long tradition of wearing [[gold jewelry]], particularly [[bangle]]s. During weddings, the bride is frequently adorned in gold. Many Somali women by tradition also wear gold [[necklaces]] and anklets.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi117"/&gt;

==Ethnic flag==
[[File:Somohralhd1a.png|thumb|upright|Somali woman wearing a [[Flag of Somalia|Somali flag]] dress.]]
The [[Flag of Somalia|Somali flag]] is an [[ethnic flag]] conceived to represent ethnic Somalis.&lt;ref name="Tifh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Costantino|first1=Maria|title=The Illustrated Flag Handbook|date=2002|publisher=Silverdale Books|isbn=1856056694|page=185|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=sGYhngEACAAJ|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created in 1954 by the Somali scholar [[Mohammed Awale Liban]], after he had been selected by the labour trade union of the [[Trust Territory of Somalia]] to come up with a design.&lt;ref name="Crwf"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the flag|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/so.html#history|publisher=CRW Flags|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon [[Independence Day (Somalia)|independence]] in 1960, the flag was adopted as the national flag of the nascent [[Somali Republic]].&lt;ref name="Wasf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Somalia Flag|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/flags/countrys/africa/somalia.htm|publisher=World Atlas|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five-pointed ''Star of Unity'' in the flag's center represents the Somali ethnic group inhabiting the five territories in [[Greater Somalia]].&lt;ref name="Wasf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cwfbsom"&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook - Somalia|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/flags/flagtemplate_so.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=20 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915100458/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/flags/flagtemplate_so.html|archivedate=15 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Somali cuisine}}
[[File:Somregcammil.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Women from Fafan village in the Somali Regional State offering camel milk.]]
The Somalis staple food comes from their livestock, however, the [[Somali cuisine]] varies from region to region and consists of a [[Fusion cuisine|fusion]] of diverse culinary influences. In the interiors, the cuisine is mainly local with usage of Ethiopian grains and vegetables while in the coast it is the product of Somalia's rich [[Maritime history of Somalia|tradition of trade and commerce]]. Despite the variety, there remains one thing that unites the various regional cuisines: all food is served [[halal]]. There are therefore no pork dishes, alcohol is not served, nothing that died on its own is eaten, and no blood is incorporated.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi110"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abdullahi|first=Mohamed Diriye|title=Culture and Customs of Somalia|date=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0313313334|pages=110–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breakfast (''quraac'') is an important meal for Somalis, some drink [[tea]] (''shahie or shaah)'' others [[coffee]] (''qaxwa or bun''). The tea is often in the form of ''[[Shahi Haleeb|haleeb shai]]'' (Yemeni milk tea) in the north. The main dish is typically a pancake-like bread (''canjeero'' or ''canjeelo'') similar to Ethiopian [[injera]], but smaller and thinner, or ''muufo'' a Somali flat bread traditionally baked on a clay oven. These breads might also be eaten with a stew (''maraqe'') or soup at lunch or dinner.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullahi, pp.111-114.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Qado'' or lunch is often elaborate, varieties of ''bariis'' ([[rice]]), the most popular being [[basmati]] are usually served as the main dish alongside goat, lamb or fish. Spices like [[cumin]], [[cardamom]], [[clove]]s, [[cinnamon]], and [[Salvia officinalis|garden sage]] are used to aromatize these different rice delicacies. Somalis eat dinner as late as 9 pm. During [[Ramadan (calendar month)|Ramadan]], supper is often served after [[Tarawih]] prayers; sometimes as late as 11 pm.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi110"/&gt;

In some regions'', xalwo'' ([[halva]]) is a popular confection eaten during festive occasions such as Eid celebrations or wedding receptions. It is made from sugar, [[corn starch]], cardamom powder, [[nutmeg]] powder and [[ghee]]. [[Peanut]]s are also sometimes added to enhance texture and flavor.&lt;ref&gt;Barlin Ali, ''Somali Cuisine'', (AuthorHouse: 2007), p.79&lt;/ref&gt; After meals, homes are traditionally perfumed using [[frankincense]] (''lubaan'') or [[incense]] (''cuunsi''), which is prepared inside an incense burner referred to as a ''[[dabqaad]]''.

==Literature==
{{Main|Somali literature}}
[[File:Nadifa Mohamed.jpg|thumb|Award-winning author [[Nadifa Mohamed]].]]
Somali scholars have for centuries produced many notable examples of [[Islamic literature]] ranging from poetry to [[Hadith]]. With the adoption of the [[Somali alphabet|Latin alphabet]] in 1972 to transcribe the Somali language, numerous contemporary Somali authors have also released novels, some of which have gone on to receive worldwide acclaim. Most of the early Somali literature is in the [[Arabic script]] and [[Wadaad writing|''Wadaad'' writing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Omniglot - Somali writing scripts|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/somali.htm|publisher=Omniglot}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage was limited to Somali clerics and their associates, as sheikhs preferred to write in the liturgical Arabic language.

==Law==
{{Main|Xeer}}
[[File:2016 16 Youth Workshop-6 (30821301124).jpg|thumb|Federal legislator [[Muna Khalif]] chairing a political workshop.]]
Somalis for centuries have practiced a form of [[customary law]], which they call ''[[xeer]]''. Xeer is a [[polycentric law|polycentric]] legal system where there is no monopolistic agent that determines what the law should be or how it should be interpreted. It is assumed to have developed exclusively in the Horn of Africa since approximately the 7th century. Given the dearth of [[loan word]]s from foreign languages within the xeer's nomenclature, the customary law appears to have evolved in situ.&lt;ref name=misesSHM&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mises.org/story/2701|title=Mises Daily|work=Mises Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jawari.png|thumb|left|[[Mohamed Osman Jawari]], speaker of the Federal Parliament.]]
Xeer is defined by a few fundamental tenets that are immutable and which closely approximate the principle of ''[[jus cogens]]'' in [[international law]]: payment of [[Blood money (term)|blood money]] (locally referred to as ''[[Diyya|diya]]'' or ''mag''), assuring good inter-[[clan]] relations by treating women justly, negotiating with "peace emissaries" in good faith, and sparing the lives of socially protected groups (e.g. children, women, the pious, poets and guests), family obligations such as the payment of [[dowry]], and sanctions for eloping, rules pertaining to the management of resources such as the use of pasture land, water, and other natural resources, providing financial support to married female relatives and newlyweds, donating livestock and other assets to the poor.&lt;ref name="SJS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stateless Justice in Somalia|url=http://www.hdcentre.org/files/Somalia%20report.pdf|date=2005-06-01|author=Dr Andre Le Sage|publisher=Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118151830/http://www.hdcentre.org/files/Somalia%20report.pdf|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Xeer legal system also requires a certain amount of [[division of labour|specialization]] of different functions within the legal framework. Thus, one can find ''odayal'' (judges), ''xeer boggeyaal'' ([[jurist]]s), ''guurtiyaal'' ([[detective]]s), ''garxajiyaal'' ([[Lawyer|attorney]]s), ''murkhaatiyal'' ([[witnesses]]) and ''waranle'' ([[police officer]]s) to enforce the law.&lt;ref name=HAblele&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiiraan.com/op2/2008/oct/back_to_somali_roots.aspx|title=Back to Somali roots|work=hiiraan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
{{Somali Architecture}}
{{Main|Somali architecture}}
[[Somali architecture]] is a rich and diverse tradition of [[Civil engineering|engineering]] and [[design]]ing. It involves multiple different construction types, such as [[Masonry|stone cities]], [[castle]]s, [[citadel]]s, [[Fortification|fortresses]], [[mosque]]s, [[mausoleum]]s, [[tower]]s, [[tomb]]s, [[Tumulus|tumuli]], [[cairn]]s, [[megalith]]s, [[menhir]]s, [[Stele|stelae]], [[dolmen]]s, [[stone circle]]s, [[monument]]s, [[temples]], [[Enclosure (archaeology)|enclosures]], [[cistern]]s, [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]], and [[lighthouse]]s. Spanning the ancient, medieval and early modern periods in Greater Somalia, it also includes the fusion of Somali architecture with Western designs in [[Contemporary architecture|contemporary]] times.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi105"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abdullahi|first=Mohamed Diriye|title=Culture and Customs of Somalia|date=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0313313334|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Somalia, [[pyramid]]ical structures known in Somali as ''taalo'' were a popular burial style. Hundreds of these [[dry stone]] monuments are found around the country today. Houses were built of [[Stonemasonry|dressed stone]] similar to the ones in [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Man, God and Civilization pg 216"/&gt; There are also examples of [[courtyard]]s and large stone walls enclosing settlements, such as the [[Wargaade Wall]].

The peaceful introduction of [[Islam]] in the early medieval era of Somalia's history brought [[Islamic architecture|Islamic architectural influences]] from [[Arabia]] and [[Persia]]. This had the effect of stimulating a shift in construction from drystone and other related materials to [[Coral|coral stone]], [[Mudbrick|sundried bricks]], and the widespread use of [[limestone]] in Somali architecture. Many of the new architectural designs, such as mosques, were built on the ruins of older structures. This practice would continue over and over again throughout the following centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Diriye, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

Somalis constitute the largest ethnic group in Somalia, at approximately 85% of the nation's inhabitants.&lt;ref name="2009factbook"/&gt; They also comprise around 60% of the inhabitants in Djibouti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Djibouti|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/dj.html|publisher=CIA World Factbook|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Somali Civil War|Civil strife]] in the early 1990s greatly increased the size of the [[Somali diaspora]], as many of the best educated Somalis left for the Middle East, Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innercitypress.com/UNPOSstrategy.doc Somali Diaspora] - ''[[Inner City Press]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]], the cities of [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]], [[Winnipeg]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] all harbor Somali populations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We analysed mtDNA variation in ~250 persons from Libya, Somalia, and Congo/Zambia, as representatives of the three regions of interest. Our initial results indicate a sharp cline in M1 frequencies that generally does not extend into sub-Saharan Africa. While our North and especially East African samples contained frequencies of M1 over 20%, our sub-Saharan samples consisted almost entirely of the L1 or L2 haplogroups only. In addition, there existed a significant amount of homogeneity within the M1 haplogroup. This sharp cline indicates a history of little admixture between these regions. This could imply a more recent ancestry for M1 in Africa, as older lineages are more diverse and widespread by nature, and may be an indication of a back-migration into Africa from the Middle East."&lt;ref name="AD."/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Autosomal DNA===
[[File:Young Somali man2a.jpg|thumb|A young Somali man.]]
According to an [[Autosome|autosomal DNA]] study by Hodgson et al. (2014), the Afro-Asiatic languages were likely spread across Africa and the Near East by an ancestral population(s) carrying a newly identified non-African genetic component, which the researchers dub the "Ethio-Somali". This Ethio-Somali component is today most common among Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in the Horn of Africa. It reaches a frequency peak among ethnic Somalis, representing the majority of their ancestry. The Ethio-Somali component is most closely related to the Maghrebi non-African genetic component, and is believed to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries at least 23,000 years ago. On this basis, the researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population(s) probably arrived in the pre-agricultural period from the Near East, having crossed over into northeastern Africa via the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. The population then likely split into two branches, with one group heading westward toward the [[Maghreb]] and the other moving south into the Horn.&lt;ref name="Hodgson2014"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodgson|first=Jason A.|last2=Mulligan|first2=Connie J.|last3=Al-Meeri|first3=Ali|last4=Raaum|first4=Ryan L.|date=2014-06-12|title=Early Back-to-Africa Migration into the Horn of Africa|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004393|journal=PLOS Genetics|volume=10|issue=6|pages=e1004393|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004393|issn=1553-7404|pmc=4055572|pmid=24921250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient DNA analysis indicates that this foundational ancestry in the Horn region is akin to that of the Neolithic farmers of the southern [[Levant]].&lt;ref name="Lazaridis2016"&gt;{{cite biorxiv|last=Lazaridis|first=Iosif|last2=Nadel|first2=Dani|last3=Rollefson|first3=Gary|last4=Merrett|first4=Deborah C.|last5=Rohland|first5=Nadin|last6=Mallick|first6=Swapan|last7=Fernandes|first7=Daniel|last8=Novak|first8=Mario|last9=Gamarra|first9=Beatriz|date=2016-06-16|title=The genetic structure of the world9s first farmers|biorxiv=059311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholarly term for research concerning Somalis and Greater Somalia is known as [[Somali Studies]]. It consists of several disciplines such as [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]], [[historiography]] and [[archaeology]]. The field draws from old [[Somali literature|Somali chronicles]], records and oral literature, in addition to written accounts and traditions about Somalis from explorers and geographers in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. Since 1980, prominent ''Somalist'' scholars from around the world have also gathered annually to hold the International Congress of Somali Studies.

===Somalist scholars===
*[[Osman Yusuf Kenadid]] – Pioneering scholar and writer on Somali history and science. Inventor of the [[Osmanya alphabet|Osmanya script]] and author of several textbooks on Somali language, astronomy, geography and philosophy.

The term '''tribe''' or '''digital tribe'''&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Digital Tribes - Creating Behaviour Change in Users - The UX Review|url = http://theuxreview.co.uk/digital-tribes-creating-behaviour-change-users/|website = The UX Review|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used as a [[slang]] term for an unofficial [[community]] of people who share a common interest, and usually who are loosely affiliated with each other through [[social media]] or other [[Internet]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;mechanisms. The term is related to "''[[tribe]]''", which traditionally refers to people closely associated in both [[geography]] and [[genealogy]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tribes and Tribal: Origin, Use, and Future of the Concept|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260405121_Tribes_and_Tribal_Origin_Use_and_Future_of_the_Concept|website = ResearchGate|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, it looks more like a [[virtual community]] or a personal network and it is often called global digital tribe. Most [[anthropologist]]s agree that a tribe is a (small) [[society]] that practices its own customs and [[culture]], and that these define the tribe. The tribes are divided into [[clan]]s, with their own customs and [[cultural values]] that differentiate them from activities that occur in 'real life' contexts. People feel more inclined to share and defend their [[idea]]s on [[social network]]s than they would dare to say to someone face to face. For example, it would be ridiculous to '[[Poke (Facebook)|poke]]' someone in real life.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Learning with 'e's: Global digital tribe|url = http://steve-wheeler.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/global-digital-tribe.html|website = steve-wheeler.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term "[[tribe]]" originated around the time of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-states and the early formation of the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Latin]] term "tribus" has since been transformed to mean "''A group of persons forming a [[community]] and claiming descent from a common [[ancestor]]''" (Oxford English Dictionary, IX, 1933, p.&amp;nbsp;339, as cited in Fried, 1975, p.&amp;nbsp;7). As years passed by, the range of meanings have grown greater, for example, "''Any of various systems of [[social organization]] comprising several local [[village]]s, [[Tribe (Native American)|band]]s, [[districts]], lineages, or other groups and sharing a common [[Ancestor|ancestry]], [[language]], [[culture]], and [[name]]''" (Morris, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;1369). Morris (1980) also notes that a [[tribe]] is a "''group of persons with a common occupation, interest, or [[habit]],''" and "''a large family.''"&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Vestiges of ancient tribe communities were preserved in both large gatherings (like [[football]] matches) and in small ones (like [[Church (building)|church]] [[Community|communities]]). Even though nowadays the range of groups referred to as tribal is truly enormous, it wasn't until the [[industrial society]] eroded the tribal gatherings of more primitive societies and redefined [[community]]. However, the existence of [[social media]] as we know it today is due to the [[post-industrial society]] that has seen the rapid growth of [[personal computer]]s, [[mobile phone]]s and [[Internet|the Internet]]. People now can [[Collaboration|collaborate]], [[Communication|communicate]], celebrate, commemorate, give their advice and share their ideas around these virtual clans that have once again redefined the [[Social behavior|social behaviour]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The first attempt of such social [[Community|communities]] dates back to at least 2003, when [[tribe.net]] was launched.

=== tribe.net starting point ===
Tribe Networks is the driving force behind [[tribe.net]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = tribe.net|url = http://www.tribe.com/|website = tribe.net|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a [[website]] similar to other [[Social networking websites|social networking]] sites. Users can create their own profiles and join networks, called 'tribes', based on common interests. Moreover, members can post job offers and event recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why did tribe.net (Mark Pincus) not work out? - Quora|url = https://www.quora.com/Why-did-tribe.net-(Mark-Pincus)-not-work-out|website = www.quora.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribe serves 50 metropolitan [[market (place)|market]]s, its largest being the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], [[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Los Angeles]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[New York City]]. The firm was found in July 2003 by [[Mark Pincus]], Paul Martino and Valerie Syme, with the goal of connecting local people for what Pincus described as "''an online cocktail party where people are getting leads through their friends. So people are there to have fun and connect and meet new people.''" Soon the site caught the attention of [[Knight Ridder]], The Washington Post Company and blue chip venture firm Mayfield, which both totally invested around $6.3 million in [[venture capital]]. After three months of activity, Tribe brought together 48,000 registered users and 6,900 distinct tribes, earning revenue from job postings and class fields.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Vault Guide to the Top Internet Industry Employers|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OPjwN9_FmkYC|publisher = Vault Inc.|date = 2006-01-01|isbn = 9781581313840|first = Laurie|last = Pasiuk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tribes from a technical perspective ==
Not only do [[Twitter]] tribes have mutual interests,&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The rise of the Twitter tribes|url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/02/twitter-tribes-lady-gaga-rihanna|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-01|first = Michael|last = Cragg}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they also share potentially [[subconscious]] [[language]] features as found in the 2013 study by researchers from [[Royal Holloway University of London]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. Dr. John Bryden from the School of Biological Sciences at Royal Holloway states that it is possible to anticipate which community somebody is likely to belong to,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Which Twitter tribe are you? Researchers discover new wave of online communities which even have their own languages|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2293912/Twitters-online-tribes-revealed-Users-forming-distinct-communities-languages-study-shows.html|website = Mail Online|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with up to 80 percent accuracy. This research shows that people try to join [[Society|societies]] based on the same interests and [[Hobby|hobbies]]. In order to achieve this, publicly available messages were sent via Twitter to record conversations between two or more participants. As a result, each community can be characterised by their most used words. This approach can enrich new communities detection based on word analysis in order to automatically classify people inside [[social network]]s. The methods of identification of tribes relied heavily on [[algorithm]]s and techniques from [[statistical physics]], [[computational biology]] and [[network science]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Word usage mirrors community structure in the online social network Twitter|url = http://www.epjdatascience.com/content/2/1/3|journal = EPJ Data Science|date = 2013-02-25|issn = 2193-1127|pages = 3|volume = 2|issue = 1|doi = 10.1140/epjds15|first = John|last = Bryden|first2 = Sebastian|last2 = Funk|first3 = Vincent AA|last3 = Jansen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Twitter users forming tribes with own language, tweet analysis shows|url = https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/mar/15/twitter-users-tribes-language-analysis-tweets|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-31|first = Jason|last = Rodrigues}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = People with same interests or occupation form 'tribes' on Twitter {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|url = http://www.dnaindia.com/scitech/report-people-with-same-interests-or-occupation-form-tribes-on-twitter-1811627|website = dna|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ickn.org/documents/Tribefinder_COINs18.pdf|title=Identifying Tribes on Twitter through Shared Context|last=Gloor|first=P.|last2=Fronzetti Colladon|first2=A.|date=|website=ICKN Intelligent Collaborative Knowledge Networks|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-11|last3=de Oliveira|first3=J.|last4=Rovelli|first4=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different approach is taken by Tribefinder.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The system is able to identify tribal affiliations of [[Twitter]] users using [[deep learning]] and [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The system establishes to which tribes individuals belong through the analysis of their tweets and the comparison of their [[vocabulary]]. These tribal vocabularies are previously generated based on the vocabulary of tribal influencers and leaders using keywords expressing concepts, ideas and beliefs. 

The final step to make the system learn on how to associate random individuals with specific tribes consists of the analysis of the language these influential tribal leaders use through deep learning. In so doing, classifiers are created using embedding and [[Long short-term memory|LSTM]] (long short-term memory) models. Specifically, these classifiers work by collecting the Twitter feeds of all the users from the tribes that Tribefinder is training on. On these, [[embedding]] is applied to map words into vectors, which are then used as input for the following LSTM models. Tribefinder analyzes the individual’s word usage in their tweets and then assigns the corresponding alternative realities, lifestyle, and recreation tribal affiliation based on the similarities with the specific tribal vocabularies. 

== An in-depth look into the research ==
The research had four main stages on which it focused: background, results, conclusions and methods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Background ===
The [[language]] is a system of [[communication]] consisting of [[phoneme|sounds]], words, and [[grammar]], or the system of [[communication]] used by people in a particular [[country]] or type of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = language Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|url = http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/language|website = dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language is perhaps the most important characteristic that distinguishes human beings from other animals.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, M.A, Jansen, V.A.A., and Plotkin, J.B 2000. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v404/n6777/abs/404495a0.html] Nature, 404, pp.495-498.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has a wide range of social implications that can be associated with [[Social group|social or cultural groups]]. People usually group in communities with the same interests. This will result in a variation of the words they use because of the differentiation of terms from each domain. Therefore, the [[Hypothesis of a theorem|hypothesis]] of this study would be that this variation should closely match the community structure of the [[Social network|network]]. To test this theory, around 250,000 users from the [[List of social networking websites|social networking]] and [[microblogging]] site Twitter were monitored in order to analyse whether the groups identified had the same language features or not. As Twitter uses unstructured data and users can send messages to any other users, the study had to be based on complex algorithms. These algorithms had to determine the word frequency inside messages between people and make a link to the groups they usually visited.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Results and discussion ===
[[File:Word usage based tribes on Twitter, Bryden et al.png|thumb|517x517px|Communication between and within tribes of [[Twitter]] users [[Cluster analysis|clustered]] based on word usage. '''Tribes''' tend to communicate more within than between themselves.]]
The problem of detecting the community features is one of the main issues in the study of networking systems. [[Social network]]s naturally tend to divide themselves into communities or [[modules]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Modularity and community structure in networks|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/103/23/8577|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2006-06-06|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 1482622|pmid = 16723398|pages = 8577–8582|volume = 103|issue = 23|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0601602103|first = M. E. J.|last = Newman|arxiv = physics/0602124|bibcode = 2006PNAS..103.8577N}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some world networks are too big so they must be simplified before information can be extracted.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = mapequation.org - publications|url = http://www.mapequation.org/publications.html|website = www.mapequation.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, an effective way of dealing with this drawback for smaller communities is by using ''[[Modularity (programming)|modularity]]'' [[algorithm]]s in order to partition users into even smaller [[Social group|groups]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For larger ones, a more efficient algorithm called 'map equation' decomposes a [[Network topology|network]] into [[Modularity|modules]] by optimally compressing a description of information flows on the network.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Each community was therefore characterised according to the words they used the most, based on a ranking algorithm. To determine the significance of word usage differences, word endings and word lengths were also measured and showed that the [[pattern]] found was the correct one. Moreover, these studies also helped in predicting community membership of users, by comparing their own word frequencies with community word usage. This helped in forecasting which community a certain user is going to access based on the words that they are using.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Proportion of users whose community is correctly predicted.png|thumb|The proportion of users whose topological community association is correctly predicted by the study.|700x700px|none]]

=== Conclusions ===
[[File:An illustration of the method for predicting which community a user is embedded in.png|thumb|An illustration of the method for predicting which community a user is embedded in.|333x333px]]
The aim of this research was to study the bond between community structure in a social network environment and language use within the community . The striking pattern that was found suggests that people from different clans tend to use different words based on their own interests and hobbies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This study can show how people make friends based on the same [[vocabulary]] range that they use.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Even though this approach didn't manage to cover all people inside Twitter, it has several advantages over ordinary surveys that cover a smaller scale of groups: it is systematic, it is non-intrusive and it easily produces large volumes of rich [[data]]. Moreover, other cultural characteristics can be found out when extending this study. For example, whether individuals that belong to multiple communities use different word sets in each of them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Methods ===
A process called [[Snowball sampling|snowball-sampling]] helped forming the sample [[Network topology|network]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Word usage mirrors community structure in the online social network Twitter - Springer|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjds15/fulltext.html|doi = 10.1140/epjds15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each user's [[Twitter|tweets]] and messages were recorded and any new users referenced were added to a list from where they were picked to be sampled. Messages that were copies have been ignored. In order to find out the words that characterise each clan, the fraction of people that use a certain word was compared with the fraction of people that use that word globally. The difference between communities has also been measured by comparing the relative word usage frequency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Last but not least, individual word usage was compared with each community word usage to pick the best matching clan for individual users.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Different language misspellings within tribes ==
[[Word]]s, and the way we [[Spelling|spell]] them are in a continuous change, as we find new ways to communicate. Despite the fact that traditional [[Dictionary|dictionaries]] don't take into account the changes, online ones have adopted many of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Misspellings show language's evolution, but does that mean they're OK for journalists to use? {{!}} Poynter.|url = http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/161298/misspellings-show-languages-evolution-but-does-that-mean-theyre-ok-for-journalists-to-use/|website = www.poynter.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interesting fact outlined in the research above is that communities tend to use their own misspelt words. According to Professor Vincent Jansen from [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway]] communities would misspell words in different ways, just as people have different regional [[Diacritic|accents]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For example, [[Justin Bieber]] fans tend to end words in ''"ee"'' as in ''"pleasee"'', while school teachers tend to use long words. Moreover, the largest group found in the study was composed of [[African American]]s who were using the words ''"[[nigga]]"'', ''"poppin"'', and ''"chillin"''. Members of this community also had the common habit of shortening the ends of the words, replacing ''"ing"'' with ''"in"'' and ''"er"'' with ''"a"''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== The campfire ==
Each tribe has an [[Electronic trading platform|online-platform]] (such as [[Flickr]] or [[Tumblr]]), called campfire around which they gather. These campfires tend to enable one or more of the following three tribal activities:&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* [[Cooperation]] (e.g. [[Wikipedia]])
* [[Communication]] (e.g. [[Social network]]s)
* [[Cognition]] (e.g. [[Blogs]])
However, some brands are building their own tribes around [[Platforms (computing)|platforms]] outside of these.

== Cooperation ==
[[Cooperation]] is the action of working together to the same end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = cooperation - definition of cooperation in English from the Oxford dictionary|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cooperation|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperation developed naturally over time, as it helped companies to streamline their research costs and to better answer to users' requirements. As a result, nowadays organisations are looking for flexible structures that can easily adapt to this rapidly changing environment. [[Collaborative software|Groupware]] systems perfectly cater to these needs of companies. Informal [[communication]] predominates and specialists in certain domains exchange their experience with other people within the groupware environment. [[Collaboration]] and cooperation are available through instant messages; people can discuss, chat and swap ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Software Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_SklFgSidxQC|publisher = IGI Global|date = 2009-03-31|isbn = 9781605660615|first = Tiako, Pierre|last = F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, people can work together while they are located remotely from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is groupware? - Definition from WhatIs.com|url = http://searchdomino.techtarget.com/definition/groupware|website = SearchDomino|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groupware can be split into three categories: '''communication''', '''collaboration''' and '''coordination''', depending on the level of cooperation and technology involved in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Groupware: Communication, Collaboration and Coordination |url=http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2015-11-01 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713051554/http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the biggest and well-known cooperation software is Wikipedia.
[[File:Wikipedia-logo-v2-en.svg|thumb|The logo of Wikipedia]]

=== Wikipedia ===
[[Wikipedia]] is a [[Collaborative real-time editor|collaborative software]] because anyone can edit it. You can edit articles, view past revisions and discuss through a forum the current state of each article. Due to the fact that anyone can change it and find [[information]] very quickly, it has become one of the 10 most accessed sites on the Internet.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Advantages ====
Wikipedia has many advantages over other encyclopedias:&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Using the Web to Get Stuff Done: What is Wikipedia?|url = http://www.gcflearnfree.org/using-the-web-to-get-stuff-done/what-is-wikipedia|website = GCFLearnFree.org|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Advantages and Disadvantages Of Using Wikipedia For Research  - Youth Village|url = http://www.youthvillage.co.za/2014/10/advantages-disadvantages-using-wikipedia-research/|website = Youth Village|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It's free and open for anyone on the Internet;
* All past edits and chats from the forum are public and everyone can see them;
* Updates happen frequently;
* It contains millions of articles;
* Easy to use and learn;

==== Disadvantages ====
However, there are also some drawbacks:&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
* Information can be inaccurate;
* It is open to [[Spamming|spam]] and [[vandalism]];
* Some articles can contain omissions and be hard to understand;
* It can be too open sometimes (for [[Confidentiality|confidential]] documentation);

== Communication ==
[[Communication]] is the act or an instance of communicating; the imparting or exchange of [[information]], [[idea]]s, or [[feeling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of "communication" {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/communication|website = www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication has drastically changed over time and [[social network]]s have changed the way people [[Communication|communicate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.solari.net/documents/position-papers/Solari-Social-Media-and-Communication.pdf|title = Social Media and Its Effect on Communication|date = 2014|accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = http://www.solari.net/|publisher = Solari Communication|last = Maggiani|first = Rich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though people]can interact with each other 24/7, there is a new wave of barriers and [[threat]]s. In the [[workplace]] environment, electronic Communication has overtaken face-to-face and voice-to-voice Communication by far. This major shift has been done in advantage of [[Millennials|Generation Y]], who prefer [[instant messaging]] than talking directly to someone. It is often said that it could become an ironic twist, but [[social media]] has the real potential of making us less social.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is Social Media Sabotaging Real Communication?|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/susantardanico/2012/04/30/is-social-media-sabotaging-real-communication/|website = Forbes|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are studies that confirm that people are becoming more social, but the style in which they interact with each other has changed a lot. One of the major drawbacks of social networks is [[privacy]], as people tend to trust others more rapidly and send more open [[message]]s about themselves. As a result, personal information can be easily exposed to other persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Social Media and Interpersonal Communication|url = http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/051313p10.shtml|website = www.socialworktoday.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] are two of the biggest social networks in the world.

=== Facebook ===
{{essay|section|date=December 2015}}
[[Facebook]] is currently the largest social network in the world with more than 1 billion people using this website. This actually means that one in seven people on Earth use Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = From relationships to revolutions: seven ways Facebook has changed the world|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/28/from-relationships-to-revolutions-seven-ways-facebook-has-changed-the-world|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-01|first = Jessica|last = Elgot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook users share their stories, images and videos in order to celebrate and commemorate events together. They can also play [[social network game|social games]] and like other Facebook pages.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Moreover, there is also a section called {{'}}''News Feed''{{'}} where users can see social information from their [[Friendship|friends]] or from the pages that they liked or shared. Each user has their own profile page that is called 'wall', where they can post all the above-mentioned materials (their friends can do this as well).&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&amp;context=etd_mas_theses|title = The Virtual Campfire: An Ethnography of Online Social Networking|date = May 2008|accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/|publisher = Wesleyan University|last = Ryan|first = Jennifer Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest advantage of Facebook is that you can make new friends, as well as find old [[Interpersonal relationship|acquaintances]] and restart [[Socialization|socialising]] with them. One of the most useful feature of Facebook is the existence of [[Social group|groups]]. Users with the same interests can create a new group or take part in already existing ones to debate information and exchange their ideas. However, there are also groups that are created to declare an affiliation, such as an obsession for different subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Group Dilemma|url = https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/the-group-dilemma/2249512130|website = www.facebook.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] is another social network that allows users to send and read short messages called 'tweets'. Even though messages can contain only 140 characters, this is the perfect length for sending status updates to followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New user FAQs|url = https://support.twitter.com/articles/13920|website = Twitter Help Center|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage of Twitter is that people can gain followers quickly and share ideas and [[links (web browser)|links]] very fast. There are [[Social network|network]]s of influential people who can be connected via Twitter.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Twitter: Top 5 Ways to Find Your Tribe|url = http://www.thebookdesigner.com/2012/01/twitter-top-5-ways-to-find-your-tribe/|website = The Book Designer|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Twitter, tribes manifest themselves as followers of either a person, a company or an institution. As a result, it can be used as a [[marketing]] tool to make someone's [[product (business)|product]] visible, on condition that a big tribe of followers is created. In order to do this, the right community must be built, as finding the right people can be a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Build Your Twitter Tribe|url = http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-build-your-twitter-tribe/|website = Social Media Examiner|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some steps that users could take into account in order to make connections and therefore make people follow them: search using Twitter search, follow the followers of other users, look at Twitter Lists, use #[[Hashtag]]s and find [[Third-party developer|third-party]] programs.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Cognition ==
[[Cognition]] is the mental action or process of acquiring [[knowledge]] and understanding through [[thought]], [[experience]] and [[sense]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = cognition - definition of cognition in English from the Oxford dictionary|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cognition|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; People like to share their ideas and gather together via [[blog]]s. A blog is an online [[Diary|journal]] where people express themselves and want to get their voice heard. People tend to frequent blog communities due to the fact that they offer specific information in which the reader is interested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is a Blog? - Blog Basics|url = http://blogbasics.com/what-is-a-blog/|website = Blog Basics|publisher = https://www.google.com/+Blogbasics|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also [[business]] blogs that can be used to share information within a company. These can be used as a flexible medium, where employees can be informed about topics that can range from the use of new [[technology]] to the company policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Help - IBM Connections|url = https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/help/index.jsp?topic=%252Fcom.ibm.lotus.connections.blogs.help%252Fc_welcome_blogs.html|website = www.ibm.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On blogs, people tend to gather in tribes or [[clan]]s if they find information that can satisfy their interests. In order to accomplish this goal, bloggers title their postings in such way that they can catch people's attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Medical Web Design {{!}} Medical Marketing {{!}} Medical Web Development|url = http://www.mednet-tech.com/newsletter/blogs/what-are-blogs|website = www.mednet-tech.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest advantage of blogs is that bloggers tend to help each other when someone feels at a loss due to the fact that some bonds might have been created inside the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Blog Tip Friday: Create your blogging tribe|url = http://www.honestmom.com/2013/04/05/blog-tip-friday-create-your-blogging-tribe/|website = Honest Mom|accessdate = 2015-11-02|first = Find a Tribe-Kirsten Oliphant|last = says}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conclusion ==
As [[Seth Godin]] states, "''The Internet eliminated geography''".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; People join tribes or clans because they find and share the same ideas and interests with other people.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The main disadvantage of old tribes is that they couldn't influence group behaviour. On the other hand, new tribes are self-sustaining and can survive without a leader, they are not necessarily dialogue based and they are long lasting. As it has been demonstrated within this article, tribes have influenced the way languages, organisations and cultures work.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; They have redefined old concepts with the help of social media and have changed the way people will interact in the future.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

[[File:Wappen der Schriftgiesser.jpg|thumb|The German coat of arms for a type-founders' guild (or "Schriftgießer" in German)]]
A '''type foundry''' is a [[company]] that [[Type design|designs]] or distributes [[typeface]]s. Before desktop publishing, type foundries manufactured and sold metal and wood typefaces and [[Matrix (printing)|matrices]] for line-casting machines like the [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] and [[Monotype System|Monotype]] machines designed to be used with [[Letterpress printing|letterpress]] printers. Today's [[typeface|digital type]] foundries accumulate and distribute typefaces (typically as [[Computer font|digitized fonts]]) created by [[type designer]]s, who may either be [[freelancer]]s operating their own independent foundry, or employed by another foundry. Type foundries may also provide custom type design services.

In England, type foundries began in 1476, when [[William Caxton]] introduced the [[printing press]]. Thereafter the [[City of London]] became a major centre for the industry, until the end of the 20th century when famous metal-based printing districts such as [[Fleet Street]] came to the close of their era. The industry was particularly important in [[Victorian era|Victorian times]], when education became available to all due to the new school boards, and firms such as [[Charles Reed (British politician)|Charles Reed &amp; Sons]], the printer and type founders were in their heyday. The [[St Bride Printing Library]] in the City of London encourages wider public interest in the history of type founding for the printed book and newspaper.

== Origin ==
[[Image:The Ugly American poster.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The Ugly American]]

The term was used as the title of a 1948 photograph of an American tourist in Havana by the Cuban photographer Constantino Arias (see infobox above),&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Horwitz, Ed.,[https://www.webcitation.org/600VsPmQA?url=http://myweb.uiowa.edu/rhorwitz/asacontents.htm The American Studies Anthology]&lt;/ref&gt; but seems to have entered popular culture as the title of [[The Ugly American|a 1958 book]] by authors [[William Lederer]] and [[Eugene Burdick]].  In 1963, the book was made into a [[The Ugly American (film)|film]] directed by [[George Englund]] and starring [[Marlon Brando]].

The best-selling, loosely fictional account provided contrasting characters with different approaches to opposing [[Communism|Communist]] influence in [[Southeast Asia]], and the use of [[foreign aid]] in particular.  The majority of the Americans exhibit a range of blundering, corrupt, and incompetent behaviors, often concentrating on impractical projects that will serve more to benefit American contractors than the local population.  A minority are effective because they employ knowledge of the local language and culture, but most of these are marginalized and some even considered suspect.  As a result, their influence is more limited than it should be.&lt;ref&gt;MacArthur, John, R. (2001). [http://www.commondreams.org/views01/1106-01.htm "The Ugly American Mindset"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail|Toronto Globe]]''.  Retrieved online March 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The title character, Homer Atkins, is introduced late in the book.  He is "ugly" only in his physical appearance.  Perversely, Atkins embodies the opposite traits from the pejorative traits now popularly associated with the term "Ugly American". Atkins' unattractive features, rough clothing and dirty hands are contrasted with the bureaucrats' freshly pressed clothes, clean fingers, and smooth cheeks.  Their behaviors have the opposite contrast: Atkins cares about the people of southeast Asia and wants to help them create practical solutions to their everyday problems; the bureaucrats want to build highways and dams that are not yet needed, and with no concern for the many other projects that will have to be completed before they can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Lederer, William  |author2=Burdick, Eugene |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1958 |title=The Ugly American |location=New York |publisher=Norton |oclc=287560|pages=205–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book led to a move by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight Eisenhower]] to study and reform American aid programs in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Mutual Security Program (1956–57).

In the book, a fictional [[Myanmar|Burmese]] journalist wrote, "For some reason, the people I meet in my country are not the same as the ones I knew in the United States. A mysterious change seems to come over Americans when they go to a foreign land. They isolate themselves socially. They live pretentiously. They're loud and ostentatious. Perhaps they're frightened and defensive, or maybe they're not properly trained and make mistakes out of ignorance."&lt;ref&gt;Stesney, Julie (2005).

The idea of the ignorant or badly behaving American traveler long predates this book. [[Mark Twain]] wrote about ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' in the nineteenth century, and [[Algonquin Round Table]] member [[Donald Ogden Stewart]] wrote ''Mr and Mrs Haddock Abroad'' in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Twain, Mark &amp; Cardwell, Guy.

'''Upcycling''', also known as '''creative reuse''', is the process of transforming by-products, waste materials, useless, or unwanted products into new materials or products of better quality or for better environmental value.

Upcycling is the opposite of [[downcycling]], which is the other face of the [[recycling]] process. Downcycling involves converting materials and products into new materials of lesser quality. Most recycling involves converting or extracting useful materials from a product and creating a different product or material.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web | title=Recycling| url=http://blumarble.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recycling.pdf| website=Environmental Protection Agency| accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''downcycling'' was first used in print in an article in SalvoNEWS by Thornton Kay quoting Reiner Pilz and published in 1994. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.salvoweb.com/files/sn99sm24y94tk181119.pdf Thornton Kay, Salvo in Germany - Reiner Pilz, p14 SalvoNEWS No99 11 October 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|We talked about the impending EU Demolition Waste Streams directive. "Recycling," he said, "I call it downcycling. They smash bricks, they smash everything. What we need is upcycling, where old products are given more value, not less." He despairs of the German situation and recalls the supply of a large quantity of reclaimed woodblock from an English supplier for a contract in Nuremberg, while just down the road a load of similar block was scrapped. In the road outside his premises was the result of the Germans' demolition "waste" recycling. It was a pinky looking aggregate with pieces of handmade brick, old tiles, and discernible parts of useful old items mixed with crushed concrete. Is this the future for Europe?}}

''Upsizing'' was the title of the German edition of a book about upcycling first published in English in 1998 by [[Gunter Pauli]] and given the revised title of ''Upcycling'' in 1999. The German edition was adapted to the German language and culture by Johannes F. Hartkemeyer, then Director of the [[Volkshochschule]] in [[Osnabrück]]. The concept was later incorporated by [[William McDonough]] and [[Michael Braungart]] in their 2002 book ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]''. They state that the goal of upcycling is to prevent wasting potentially useful materials by making use of existing ones. This reduces the consumption of new [[raw materials]] when creating new products. Reducing the use of new raw materials can result in a reduction of energy usage, [[air pollution]], [[water pollution]] and even [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.

This is a significant step towards regenerative design culture where the end products are cleaner, healthier, and usually have a better value than the material inputs.

For example, during the recycling process of plastics other than those used to create bottles, many different types of plastics are mixed, resulting in a hybrid. This hybrid is used in the manufacturing of plastic lumber applications.  However, unlike the engineered polymer ABS which hold properties of several plastics well, recycled plastics suffer phase-separation that causes structural weakness in the final product.

In 2009, Belinda Smith from Reuters wrote that upcycling had increased in the rich countries but observed that upcycling was a necessity in poorer ones: &lt;blockquote&gt;Supporters of the [[environmentally friendly]] practice of upcycling say people in developing countries have effectively been upcycling for years, using old packaging and clothing in new ways, although more out of need than for the environment. But upcycling is now taking off in other countries, reflecting an increased interest in [[Sustainable products|eco-friendly products]], particularly ones that are priced at an affordable level and proving profitable for the manufacturers. "If upcycling is going to become mainstream, then the corporate world needs to see that it can be profitable," said Albe Zakes, spokesman of U.S. company TerraCycle which specializes in finding new uses for discarded packaging. A growing number of companies are focusing on upcycling although the trend is still in its infancy with industry-wide figures yet to be produced.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldsmith|first=Belinda|date=2009-09-30|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/smallBusinessNews/idUSTRE58T3HX20090930|title=Trash or Treasure? Upcycling Becomes Growing Green Trend|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upcycling has shown significant growth across the United States. For example, the number of products on [[Etsy]] or [[Pinterest]] tagged with the word "upcycled" increased from about 7,900 in January 2010 to nearly 30,000 a year later—an increase of 275%.&lt;ref name="Entrepreneur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/219310  |title=Upcycling Becomes a Treasure Trove for Green Business Ideas |website=[[Entrepreneur Magazine]] |date=March 22, 2011 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013|04}}, that number stood at 263,685, an additional increase of 879%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southernminn.com/faribault_daily_news/news/article_a8276afa-e288-50f3-8573-203e788f9366.html|title=Upcycle trend hits Faribault area|website=Southernminn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Material [[downcycling]] occurs when it is not economic to restore materials to their original quality, for example, when wrought aluminium alloys are melted to produce lower-grade casting alloys.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullen|first=Jonathan|date=2017|title=Circular Economy: Theoretical Benchmark or Perpetual Motion Machine?|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|volume=21|issue=3|pages=483–486|doi=10.1111/jiec.12599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Material ''upcycling'', in the thermodynamic sense, is only possible if even more energy is added to upgrade the material quality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Two guiding questions to ask when assessing recovering for waste materials or products are: How much energy is required to restore the recovered material back to the desired material or product?, and, How does this quantity compare with obtaining the desired material or product from virgin or primary sources? In some cases, little energy is required to reuse a discarded product, for example, secondhand clothing. In other cases, the energy required to recover the materials is more than the energy required to process virgin material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the last case, ''upcycling'' may be considered worst for environmental emissions strategies if energy comes from fossil fuels.

[[File:Vorwarts! (Go Forward!), 1897 F.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Johann Dieter Wassmann (Jeff Wassmann), ''Vorwarts! (Go Forward!)'', 1897]]
[[File:צעצוע נגרר דרום הר חברון.jpg|thumb|A toy from Southern [[Mount Hebron]], on loan to [[Israel Museum]] from a private collection]]

The tradition of reusing [[found objects]] (''objet trouvé'') in mainstream art came of age sporadically through the 20th century, although it has long been a means of production in [[folk art]].  The [[Amish]] [[quilt]], for example, came about through reapplication of salvaged fabric. [[Simon Rodia]]'s [[Watts Towers]] (1921–1954) in [[Los Angeles]] exemplifies upcycling of scrap metal, pottery and broken glass on a grand scale; it consists of 17 structures, the tallest reaching over 30 meters into the [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] skyline.

Intellectually, upcycling bears some resemblance to the [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|ready-made]] art of [[Marcel Duchamp]] and the [[Dadaists]].  Duchamp's "[[Bicycle Wheel]]" (1913), a front wheel and fork attached to a common stool, is among the earliest of these works, while "[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]" (1917), a common urinal purchased at a hardware store, is arguably his best-known work.  Pablo Picasso's "[[Bull's Head]]" (1942), a sculpture made from a discarded bicycle saddle and handlebars, is the Spanish painter's sly nod to the Dadaists.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Eric, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703551304576261042931202326 "A Magical Metamorphosis of the Ordinary"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', April 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the mid-century the artist [[Joseph Cornell]] fabricated collages and boxed [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] works from old books, found objects and [[ephemera]]. [[Robert Rauschenberg]] collected trash and disused objects, first in Morocco and later on the streets of New York, to incorporate into his art works.

The idea of consciously raising the inherent value of recycled objects as a political statement, however, rather than presenting recycled objects as a reflection or outcome from the means of production, is largely a late 20th century concept. [[Romuald Hazoumé]], an artist from the [[West Africa]]n [[Bénin]], was heralded in 2007 for his use of discarded plastic gasoline and fuel canisters to resemble traditional African masks at [[Documenta]] 12 in [[Kassel]], [[Germany]].  Hazoumé has said of these works, "I send back to the West that which belongs to them, that is to say, the refuse of consumer society that invades us every day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caacart.com/pigozzi-artist.php?i=Hazoume-Romuald&amp;m=35|title=Romuald Hazoumé|website=Contemporary African Art Collection – The Pigozzi Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeff Wassmann]], an American artist who has lived in Australia for the past 25 years, uses items found on beaches and junk stores in his travels to create the early Modern works of a fictional German relative, [[Johann Dieter Wassmann]] (1841–1898).  In "''Vorwarts'' (Go Forward)" (pictured), Wassmann uses four simple objects to depict a vision of modern man on the precarious eave of the 20th century: an early optometry chart as background, a [[clock spring]] as eye, a 19th-century Chinese bone opium spoon from the Australian gold fields as nose and an upper set of [[dentures]] found on an Australian beach as mouth.  Wassmann is unusual among artists in that he does not sell his work, rather they are presented as gifts; by not allowing these works to re-enter the consumer cycle, he averts the [[commodification]] of his end product.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Ashley, [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/09/1065676092105.html "Hoax Most Perfect"], ''The Age'', October 11, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Zorn (artist)|Max Zorn]] is a Dutch tape artist who creates artwork from ordinary brown packaging tape and hangs pieces on street lamps as a new form of [[street art]] at night. By adding and subtracting layers of tape on [[acrylic glass]] with a surgical scalpel, the artwork can only be visible when light is placed behind it, mimicking the effects similar to [[stained glass]] window methods. His technique with pioneering upcycling with street art has been featured at Frei-Cycle 2013, the first design fair for recycling and upcycling in [[Freiburg]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designmesse für Recycling &amp; Upcycling|url=http://frei-cycle.de/|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In music ==
A prominent example is the [[Recycled Orchestra of Cateura]] in [[Paraguay]], created in 2006 by the program '''[http://www.sonidosdelatierra.org.py/ Sounds of the Earth]''', directed by [[Luis Szaran]]. The instruments of the orchestra are made from materials taken from the landfill of [[Asunción]], whose name comes from the [[Cateura]] lagoon in the area. A limited part of its real history is narrated in the film "[[Landfill Harmonic]]", according to the version of [[Favio Chavez]], ex-coordinator of "Sounds of the Earth"&lt;ref name="National Public Radio 14 September 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last= Tsioulcas |first= Anastasia | authorlink= |title= From Trash To Triumph: The Recycled Orchestra|url= https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2016/09/14/493794763/from-trash-to-triumph-the-recycled-orchestra| date= 14 September 2016|work= [[NPR]] |location=Washington, D.

== In industry ==
Many industrial processes, like plastic and electronic fabrication, rely on the consumption of finite resources.&lt;ref name="Upcycling wastes"&gt;Martin, M. and Parsapour, A. 2012. "Upcycling wastes with biogas production : An exergy and economic analysis". Venice 2012: International Symposium on Energy from Biomass and Waste (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carbon nanomaterial"&gt;Zhuo, C. and Levendis, Y. A. 2014. "Upcycling waste plastics into carbon nanomaterials: A review". ''Journal of Applied Polymer Science''. 131, 4 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the waste may have an environmental impact and can affect human health.&lt;ref name="Upcycling wastes" /&gt; Within this context, upcycling describes the use of available and future technologies to reduce waste and [[resource consumption]] by creating a product with a higher value from waste or byproduct streams.
INDUSTRIAL UPCYCLING is new complex methodology for waste prevention. In late 2015 on logistics conference LOGISTICS RIDE, Ostrava, Czech Republic, it was named for the first time INDUSTRY 5.0. It consist of tools and methods streamlining the production surplus from one process or factory to next one. The originator of the complex methodology is Michael Rada, who started successful implementation within Czech republic industrial environment and expand to other locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Sung|first1=K.|last2=Cooper|first2=T.|last3=Kettley|first3=S.|date=2014|title=Individual Upcycling Practice: Exploring the Possible Determinants of Upcycling Based on a Literature Review|location=Copenhagen|conference=Sustainable Innovation 2014 Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In consumer electronics, the process of re-manufacturing or [[Refurbishment (electronics)|refurbishment]] of second-hand products can be seen as upcycling because of the reduced energy and material consumption in contrast to new manufacturing. The re-manufactured product has a higher value than disposing or downcycling it.&lt;ref name="remanufacturing"&gt;Steinhilper, R. and Hieber, M. 2001. "Remanufacturing-the key solution for transforming downcycling into upcycling of electronics". ''Electronics and the Environment'', 2001. Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE International Symposium on (2001), 161–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[Brewer's spent grain]], a waste product of [[brewing]] processes, as a [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] in [[biogas]] processes eliminates the need for disposal and can generate significant profit to the overall brewing process. Depending on the substrate's price, a profit of approximately 20% of the operational costs is possible. In this process, the biogas plant acts as an "upcycler".&lt;ref name="Upcycling wastes" /&gt;

== In libraries ==
[[File:Upcycled Roses.jpg|thumb|Roses made from upcycled library books.]]

As libraries are becoming more than just bricks, mortar and their collections, modern librarians are increasing their programming efforts. Upcycle programs or classes/clubs are becoming more and more popular, especially with the help of [[Pinterest]]. The Titusville Public Library has an upcycle class that started out by making roses.

An organization called ScrapDC&lt;ref&gt;[http://scrapdc.org/about/what-we-are/ About ScrapDC]{{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; led Upcycle classes at the [[District of Columbia Public Library]], more specifically their [[Southeast Neighborhood Library]]. One of their more popular projects was turning old books into boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dclibrary.org/node/45020|title=Books, Upcycling, and 3-D Printing: Crafting for the Modern Age!|date=10 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jerry Falwell Library]] at [[Liberty University]] holds an annual Creative Upcycling Contest for their students. The first contest had 44 submissions of “Art Made from Books”. These submissions were three-dimensional upcycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty.edu/news/index.cfm?PID=18495&amp;MID=131771|title=Students transform books into 3D art in library upcycling contest – Liberty University|website=www.liberty.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== With food ==
Billions of pounds of food are wasted every year around the world, but there are good ways that people reuse the food and find a way to upcycle. A way that is used very often is to feed it to animals because a lot of animals, such as a pig, will eat all the scraps given. Food waste can be donated and restaurants can save all the food customers don't eat. Donations can also be made by contacting local agricultural extension offices to find out where to donate food waste and telling them how often and how much you can donate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/reduce-wasted-food-feeding-animals|title=Reduce wasted food by feeding animals|website=epa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of upcycling food would be to break it down and use it as energy. Engineers have found a way to break the food down into a reusable bio-fuel by pressure cooking it and then they are able to make methane out of the remains which can be used to produce a lot of electricity and heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/industrial-uses-wasted-food|title=Industrial uses for wasted food|website=epa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the food isn't used in those ways, another way is to just break it down and use it in compost, which will improve the soil. Pretty much any type of food waste, such as fruits, vegetables, egg shells, nuts, and nut shells, can be used in compost to make it richer soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/reducing-impact-wasted-food-feeding-soil-and-composting|title=reducing the impact of wasted food by feeding the soil and composting|website=epa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In design processes ==
Tonnes of wastes are produced every day in our cities, and some educators are attempting to raise citizens' awareness, especially the youth. To redefine the concept of recycling previously confined to trash categorization, groups of young designers have attempted to transform "trash" into potentially marketable products such as backpacks made of waste plastic bags&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.up-fuse.com/|title=Up-Fuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kubrick.com.hk/index.php/zh_hk/9789889891329.html|title=Kubrick Web Shop}}&lt;/ref&gt; and area rugs created by reusing hides&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://upcyclerefinery.com/about/|title=What We Do – Upcycle Refinery|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One relevant book published by Community Museum Project in [[Hong Kong]] in 2010, was the first experiment on upcycling systems design.  Spanning across material collecting, upcycling design, local production and public dissemination, it provides proposals towards a sustainable system that will cast impact on our strategies of waste handling and energy saving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/supplement/culture/art/20130323/18204240|title=升級再造3：廢物‧迷思|website=Apple Daily 蘋果日報|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hong Kong local inventor [[Gary Chan (inventor)|Gary Chan]] is actively involved in designing and making 'upcycling' bikes by making use of waste materials as parts for his bikes. He invented at least 8 bikes using wastes as a majority of the materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metropop.com.hk/contents/425/green/1484/|title=土炮發明王|date=2014-10-16|website=www.metropop.com.hk|language=zh-HK|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yp.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/92828/gary-chan-bad-boy-bicycle-building-hong-kong|title=Gary Chan is the bad boy of bicycle building in Hong Kong|website=Young Post {{!}} South China Morning Post|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary and his partners at Wheel Thing Makers regularly collect useful wastes such as leather skin from sofas, hardwood plates of wardrobes, or rubber tires from vehicle repair stores in the waste collection station on streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eweekly.hk/article/_title/%25E8%25BD%2586%25E8%25BD%2586%25E7%2584%25A1%25E7%25AA%25AE_kpdo78smj3|title=E Media+ {{!}} E週刊 {{!}}  e+娛樂 {{!}} Mode {{!}} 美食旅客|website=eweekly.hk|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concepts evolve allover the world to tackle issue of rising excess of waste through creation of [[Circular economy|circular economies]] within the communities.

== Potential technologies and applications ==
The worldwide plastic production was 280 million tons in 2011 and production levels are growing every year. Its haphazard disposal causes severe environmental damage such as the creation of the [[Great Pacific garbage patch]].&lt;ref name="carbon nanomaterial" /&gt; In order to solve this problem, the employment of modern technologies and processes to reuse the waste plastic as a cheap substrate is under research. The goal is to bring this material from the waste stream back into the mainstream by developing processes which will create an economic demand for them.

One approach in the field involves the conversion of waste plastics (like [[LDPE]], [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], and [[HDPE]]) into [[paramagnetic]], conducting microspheres&lt;ref name="Mondal, M. 2013"&gt;Mondal, M., Gohs, U., Wagenknecht, U. and Heinrich, G. 2013. "Polypropylene/natural rubber thermoplastic vulcanizates by eco-friendly and sustainable electron induced reactive processing". ''Radiation Physics and Chemistry''. 88, 0 (2013), 74–81.&lt;/ref&gt;  or into carbon nanomaterials by applying high temperatures and [[chemical vapor deposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Tariq Altalhi, Tushar Kumeria, Abel Santos, Dusan Losic, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.07.003 "Synthesis of well-organised carbon nanotube membranes from non-degradable plastic bags with tuneable molecular transport: Towards nanotechnological recycling"], ''Carbon'', Volume 63, November 2013, pp. 423-433, {{ISSN|0008-6223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a molecular level, the treatment of [[polymers]] like [[polypropylene]] or [[thermoplastics]] with [[electron beam]]s (doses around 150 [[gray (unit)|kGy]]) can increase material properties like [[bending strength]] and [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and provides an eco-friendly and [[sustainable]] way to upcycle them.&lt;ref name="Mondal, M. 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Czvikovszky, T. and Hargitai, H. 1997. "Electron beam surface modifications in reinforcing and recycling of polymers. Nuclear Instruments and Methods" in ''Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms''. 131, 1–4 (1997), 300–304.&lt;/ref&gt;

Active research is being carried out for the [[biotransformation]] upcycling of plastic waste (e.g., [[polyethylene terephthalate]] and [[polyurethane]]) into [[Polyhydroxyalkanoates|PHA]] [[bioplastic]] using bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.p4sb.eu/|title=Homepage – P4SB|website=www.p4sb.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PET could be converted into the biodegradable [[Polyhydroxyalkanoates|PHA]] by using a combination of temperature and microbial treatment. First it gets [[pyrolysis|pyrolized]] at 450&amp;nbsp;°C and the resulting [[terephthalic acid]] is used as a substrate for microorganisms, which convert it finally into PHA.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, S.T., Runic, J.N., Kaminsky, W., Woods, T., Babu, R.P., Keely, C.M., Blau, W. and O’Connor, K.E. 2008. "Up-Cycling of PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) to the Biodegradable Plastic PHA (Polyhydroxyalkanoate)". ''Environmental Science &amp; Technology''. 42, 20 (2008), 7696–7701.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the aforementioned approach is the combination of nanomaterials like carbon nanotubes with powdered orange peel as a composite material. This might be used to remove synthetic [[dye]]s from [[wastewater]].&lt;ref&gt;Jain, N., Basniwal, R. K., Suman, Srivastava, A. K., &amp; Jain, V. K. (2010). "Reusable nanomaterial and plant biomass composites for the removal of methylene blue from water", ''Environmental Technology'', 31(7), 755-760.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biotechnology]] companies have recently shifted focus towards the conversion of agricultural waste, or [[biomass]], to different chemicals or commodities.  One company in particular, [[BioTork]], has signed an agreement with the State of Hawaii and the [[USDA]] to convert the unmarketable papayas in Hawaii into [[fish feed]].  As part of this Zero Waste Initiative put forth by the State of Hawaii, BioTork will upcycle the otherwise wasted biomass into a high quality, omega-rich fish feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domesticfuel.com/2014/08/07/hawaii-funds-biotork-advanced-biofuel-technology/|title=Hawaii Funds BioTork Advanced Biofuel Technology|website=Domestic Fuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Clothes == 
Designers have begun to use both industrial textile waste and existing clothing as base material for creating new fashions. Upcycling has been known to use either pre-consumer or post-consumer waste or possibly a combination of the two. Pre-consumer waste is made while in the factory, such as fabric remnants left over from cutting out patterns. post-consumer waste refers to the finished product when it’s no longer useful to the owner, such as donated clothes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.triplepundit.com/special/sustainable-fashion-2014/upcycling-new-wave-sustainable-fashion/|title=Upcycling: The New Wave of Sustainable Fashion|date=May 8, 2014|author= Beth Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
Often, we practice linear economy where we are content to buy, use then throw away. This system contributes to millions of kilos of textile waste being thrown away and makes fashion is the second-most polluting industry after oil &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://textilebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Global-apparel-fibre-consumption-vs-population-FINAL.jpg|title=Global-apparel-fibre-consumption-vs-population-FINAL.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;. while most textiles produced are recyclable, around 85% end-up in landﬁlls in the USA alone &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weber |first1=Sabine |last2=Lynes |first2=Jennifer |last3=Young |first3=Steven B. |title=Fashion interest as a driver for consumer textile waste management: reuse, recycle or disposal |journal=International Journal of Consumer Studies |date=March 2017 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=207–215 |doi=10.1111/ijcs.12328}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fast fashion companies are huge contributors to these problems as their whole purpose is to mass produce cheap clothing.
To live a sustainable life we need other clothing options that demonstrates the opposite to the throw away attitude fast fashion has lead us to. Upcycling can help us with this as it puts into practice a more circular economy model. A Circular Economy is where resources are used for as long as possible, getting the most value out of them while in use, then restored and repurposed when their use is over. Popularized by McDonough and Braungart’s this has also been known as the cradle-to-cradle principle. This principle states a product should be designed either to have multiple life cycles or be biodegradable &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.flinders.edu.au/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-51253-2.pdf|title=Sustainability in Fashion|editor=Claudia E. Henninger|editor2=Panayiota J. Alevizou|editor3=Helen Goworek|editor4=Daniella Ryding|date=|website=flinders.edu.au|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-51253-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Not only does upcycling help environmentally but there are also economic benefits. By reusing materials that others may not find as desirable there are huge savings that can be made on buying supplies for business or personal use. At schools or university upcycling for art, craft and design can be an easy and cheap way to prototype or finish a student project. The can also be an economic benefit with the final product. By it definition upcycling means increasing value to the original product and this can be done by changing/adding your own spin to the design or improving material quality or fixing broken clothes.

The '''Wolani''' or '''Wodani''' are a people in the Indonesian [[Paniai Regency|Paniai regency]] (kabupaten) of the [[Papua (province)|Papua province]] (formerly Central Irian Jaya) of [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]] (western part of the island of [[New Guinea]]). Numbering about 5000 in 1992, they are farmers who live in the central highlands northeast of [[Lake Paniai]], along the Kemandoga and Mbiyandogo rivers. Many Wolani converted to [[Christianity]] but, like elsewhere in Indonesia, they retain their traditional religion. They speak [[Wolani language|Wolani]], which is affiliated with the western branch of the [[Trans–New Guinea languages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Ethnologue20|wod|Wolani}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the nearby [[Ekari language|Ekari]] and [[Moni language|Moni]] languages.

It is not clear if the Wolani are a subgroup of the [[Lani people|Lani]]. There is some imprecision in the classification of cultures in this region, with the [[Lani people|Lani]] often being identified with a larger group, the [[Dani people|Dani]].

In Pre-Islamic [[Arabian mythology]], '''Zarqa’ al-Yamama''' ({{lang-ar|{{Large|زرقاء اليمامة}}}}) was a blue-eyed woman with exceptional intuition, keen sight, and ability to predict events before they happened. Some Arab historians argue that the district of [[Al-Yamama]] was named after her.

==Zarqa al-Yamama’s legend==
According to the ancient tale, Zarqa’s tribe relied on her powers in detecting enemies and defending their land; as she was believed to have the ability to see riders from the distance of one week.  In hopes to evade Zarqa’s gaze, enemies of her tribe decided to hide behind trees which they carried. Zarqa noticed what was going on and alerted her tribe that the trees were moving towards them and that they hid soldiers behind them. To her dismay, members of her tribe thought she was going mad and choose to ignore her warning . The troops of [[Hassan Ibn Tubba' As'ad Abi Karib|Hassan al-Himyari]] eventually reached her tribe and killed every man in the camp, then they tore out Zarqa’s eyes and crucified her.
