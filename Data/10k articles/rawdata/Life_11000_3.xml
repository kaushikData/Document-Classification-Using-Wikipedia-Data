'''Aaron of Canterbury''' was an [[History of the Jews in England|English rabbi]] and [[halakha|halakhic]] exegete, mentioned in ''Minhat Yehudah'' ("The Offering of Judah") by Judah ben Eliezer on [[Deuteronomy]] xxvi.2, in association with [[Rashi]] and Rabbi [[Jacob of Orleans]], and thus, seemingly, of the twelfth century. But a passage in the ''[[Close Roll]]'' of 1242 refers the decision in a divorce case to three "magistri," Mosse of London, Aaron of Canterbury, and Jacob of Oxford, and makes it probable that the Aaron mentioned in "Minhat Yehudah" was of the thirteenth century and acted as an ecclesiastical assessor, or ''[[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayyan]]'', in London about 1242. If so, his name was Aaron fil (son of) Samson.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3239">'''Ambrosius Ehinger''', also ('''Ambrosio Alfínger''' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) '''Dalfinger, Thalfinger''', (ca. 1500 in [[Elchingen|Thalfingen]] near [[Free Imperial City of Ulm|Ulm]] &amp;ndash; 31 May 1533 near [[Chinácota]] [[Colombia]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[conquistador]] and the first governor of the [[Klein-Venedig|Welser concession, also known as “Little Venice” (Klein-Venedig)]], in [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]], now [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]].

Ehinger was a factor in [[Madrid]] for the [[Welser]] banking family when they began planning for the [[German colonization of the Americas|colonization]] of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]].  The Welsers appointed him as the first governor, and sent as his deputy the Spaniard Luis González de Leyva.  They arrived in [[Santa Ana de Coro|Coro]] in 1529 with 281 colonists and called the new colony “Little Venice” (Klein-Venedig). Almost immediately Ehinger replaced González de Leyva with [[Nicolaus Federmann]].

In August 1529 Ehinger made his first expedition to [[Lake Maracaibo]] which was bitterly opposed by the indigenous people, the [[Coquivacoa]].  After winning a series of bloody battles, he founded the settlement at [[Maracaibo]] on September 8, 1529.   Ehinger named the city Neu Nürnberg (New Nuremberg) and the lake after the valiant [[cacique|chieftain]] Mara of the Coquivacoa, who had died in the fighting.  The city was renamed Maracaibo after the Spanish took possession.

Ehinger came down with malaria and decided to recuperate in the relatively civilized comforts of [[Hispaniola]], so he handed temporary authority over to Federmann on July 30, 1530.

Upon his return, Ehinger, with 40 horse and 130 foot soldiers and an uncounted number of allied Indians, set off from Coro on September 1, 1531 on his second expedition to the alleged gold country to the west.  They crossed the Oca mountains, came over to [[Valledupar]], along the [[Cesar River]], and finally to the Zapatosa marsh.  There the expedition rested about 3 months, then it continued south, where they met fierce resistance from the indigenous tribes, so they turned east, along the [[Lebrija River]]. During this expedition they were forced to eat their horses and dogs, and lost most of their Indian allies, many dying from the cold as they crossed the mountains.  As they made their way home, they were attacked by the [[Chitarero people|Chitareros]] on May 27, 1533.  Ehinger and Captain Estéban Martín fled into a low-lying ravine, where they were pinned down by Indians shooting arrows. Ehinger received a [[poisoned arrow]] in the neck.  Despite the attentions of Augustine father Vicente de Requejada, Ehinger died on May 31, 1533, and was buried under a tree.  The expedition returned without him to Coro.

An '''archegonium''' (pl: '''archegonia'''), from the [[ancient Greek]] ''ἀρχή'' ("beginning") and ''γόνος'' ("offspring"), is a multicellular structure or organ of the [[gametophyte]] phase of certain [[plant]]s, producing and containing the [[ovum]] or female [[gamete]]. The corresponding male organ is called the [[antheridium]]. The archegonium has a long neck canal or venter and a swollen base. Archegonia are typically located on the surface of the plant [[thallus]], although in the [[hornwort]]s they are embedded. 

==Bryophytes==
In [[bryophytes]] and other [[cryptogam]]s sperm reach the archegonium by swimming in water films, whereas in [[Pinophyta]] and [[Angiosperms]] the [[pollen]] are delivered by wind or animal vectors and the sperm are delivered by means of a [[pollen tube]].

[[File:DEV035048A.jpg|thumb|Gene expression pattern determined by histochemical GUS assays in ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'']]
In the [[moss]] ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'', [[archegonia]] are not embedded but are located on top of the leafy [[gametophore]] (s. Figure). The [[Polycomb]] protein FIE is expressed in the unfertilized [[egg cell]] (right) as the blue colour after [[GUS reporter system|GUS staining]] reveals. Soon after [[fertilisation]] the [[FIE gene]] is inactivated (the blue colour is no longer visible, left) in the young embryo.&lt;ref&gt;Assaf Mosquna, Aviva Katz, Eva L. Decker, Stefan A. Rensing, [[Ralf Reski]], Nir Ohad (2009): Regulation of stem cell maintenance by the Polycomb protein FIE has been conserved during land plant evolution. Development 136, 2433-2444. [http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/content/short/136/14/2433]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Polycomb gene FIE is expressed (blue) in unfertilised egg cells of the moss Physcomitrella patens (right) and expression ceases after fertilisation in the developing diploid sporophyte (left).

==Gymnosperms==
They are much-reduced and embedded in the megagametophytes of [[gymnosperm]]s. The term is not used for [[angiosperm]]s or the gnetophytes ''[[Gnetum]]'' and ''[[Welwitschia]]'' because the megagametophyte is reduced to just a few cells, one of which differentiates into the egg cell. The function of surrounding the gamete is assumed in large part by [[diploid]] cells of the [[megasporangium]] ([[nucellus]]) inside the [[ovule]]. [[Gymnosperms]] have their archegonium formed after [[pollination]] inside female [[conifer cone]]s (megastrobili).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbg.org/gar2/topics/botany/repro_gymnosperms.html Brooklyn Botanic Garden]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1893 Australian national cricket team.jpg|thumb|Coningham pictured middle (front row) with the 1893 [[Australia national cricket team]]]]

'''Arthur Coningham''' ({{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|n|ɪ|ŋ|h|æ|m}} born 14 July 1863, [[Emerald Hill, Victoria]]. died 13 June 1939, [[Gladesville]], [[New South Wales]]) was an Australian cricketer who played in one [[The Ashes|Ashes]] Test in [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne]] in 1894 in which he took a wicket with his very first ball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283520.html Cricinfo]&lt;/ref&gt;  He took 2 for 17 in England's first innings but failed to add to that tally in the second.

==Biography==
He was renowned as something of a joker.  In an effort to stay warm while fielding in a tour match in 1893 at a frigid [[Blackpool]] he gathered straw and twigs and started a fire on the outfield.

He found life difficult after he retired from the game, serving time in [[jail]] for fraud, and he died in an asylum.&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite news

Optionally, the experiment temperature can be stabilized. BIOPAN hosts [[astrobiology]], [[radiobiology]] and materials science experiments.

The BIOPAN facility is installed on the external surface of Russian [[Foton (space programs)|Foton descent capsules]] protruding from the thermal blanket that envelops the satellite.

==Design and features==
The BIOPAN program started in the early nineties with an ESA contract for the a joint development by [[Kayser-Threde]] and [[Kayser Italia]]. It was based on the heritage of a low-tech Russian exposure container called KNA (''Kontejner Nauchnoj Apparatury''). The BIOPAN facilities are installed on the external surface of [[Foton (space programs)|Foton descent capsules]]. It has a motor-driven hinged lid, which opens 180° in Earth orbit to expose the experiment samples to the harsh space environment. For [[Atmospheric entry|re-entry]], the closed facility is protected with an [[Ablative heat shield#Ablative|Ablative heat shield]].

The BIOPAN facilities are equipped with thermometers, [[ultraviolet|UV]] sensors, a [[radiometer]], a pressure sensor and an active radiation [[dosimeter]]. Data acquired by the sensors is stored by BIOPAN throughout each mission and can be accessed after flight.&lt;ref name='Kayser'/&gt;  The possibility of overheating during atmospheric re-entry was acknowledged early during the development, therefore, a quite massive heat shield was designed for it.  While the total weight of BIOPAN is close to 27&amp;nbsp;kg, including the experiments, the heat shield is responsible for 12&amp;nbsp;kg of that figure.&lt;ref name='Horneck'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Gerda Horneck and Petra Rettberg | title = Complete Course in Astrobiology | publisher = WILEY-VCH | year = 2007 | location = Germany | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eDxeMPYJNPAC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;lpg=PA292&amp;dq=BIOPAN+experiments&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ylIHcpvAHA&amp;sig=Kg6Q0g2yE2wt-ZUVKxIou9-okOY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_AjkUYaXCMfB4APmioDABw&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=BIOPAN%20experiments&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2013-07-17 | isbn = 978-3-527-40660-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Balto''' (1919 &amp;ndash; March 14, 1933) was a [[Siberian husky]] and sled dog who led his team on the final leg of the [[1925 serum run to Nome]], in which [[diphtheria]] [[antitoxin]] was transported from [[Anchorage, Alaska]], to [[Nenana, Alaska]], by train and then to [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] by [[dog sled]] to combat an outbreak of the disease.&lt;ref name=Salisbury&gt;{{cite book |last = Salisbury |first=Gay |author2=Laney Salisbury |title=The Cruelest Miles: The Heroic Story of Dogs and Men in a Race against an Epidemic |year=2003 |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |isbn=0-393-01962-4 |pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Balto was named after the [[Sami people|Sami]] explorer [[Samuel Balto]]. Balto rested at the Cleveland Zoo until his death on March 14, 1933 at the age of 14. After he died, his body was [[taxidermy|stuffed]] and kept in the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]], where it remains today.

==1925 serum run==
{{Main article|1925 serum run to Nome}}
In January 1925 doctors realized that a potentially deadly [[diphtheria]] [[epidemic]] was poised to sweep through Nome's young people. The only serum that could stop the outbreak was in [[Anchorage]], [[Alaska (state)|Alaska]]. The engine of the only aircraft that could quickly deliver the medicine was frozen and would not start.  After considering all of the alternatives, officials decided to move the medicine via multiple [[dog sled]] teams. The serum was transported by train from Anchorage to [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]], where the first [[mushing|musher]] embarked as part of a relay aimed at delivering the needed serum to Nome. More than 20 mushers took part, facing a [[blizzard]] with &amp;minus;23&amp;nbsp;°F (-31&amp;nbsp;°C) temperatures and strong winds. News coverage of the event was worldwide.

On February 2, 1925, the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Gunnar Kaasen]] drove his team, led by Balto, into Nome. The longest and most hazardous stretch of the run was actually covered by another Norwegian, [[Leonhard Seppala]], and his dog team, led by [[Togo (dog)|Togo]]. They came from Nome towards the end of the run and picked up the serum from musher Henry Ivanoff. The serum was later passed to Kaasen.

Balto proved himself on the Iditarod trail, saving his team in the Topkok River. Balto was also able to stay on the trail in near [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] conditions; Kaasen stated he could barely see his hand in front of his face. Balto's team did their leg of the run almost entirely in the dark. The final team and its sledder were asleep when Balto and Kaasen made it to the final stop, so Kaasen decided to continue on.  At Nome, everybody wanted to thank Kaasen at first, but he suggested giving fame to Balto as well.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} &lt;!-- The page for the run says that Kaasen passed the last stop on purpose. --&gt;

Togo was the star dog for Leonhard Seppala even before the great 1925 Serum Run. Instead of celebrating the triumph together as one huge team, many became jealous of the publicity Balto received, especially from President [[Calvin Coolidge]] and the press. Seppala favored Togo, but the general public loved the story behind Balto, and so they would take a far different path after the celebrations were over. Balto was not welcomed at the ceremony in New York in which Seppala and Togo received awards from the explorer [[Roald Amundsen]].

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Balto CLE.JPG|thumb|right|Balto's remains at the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]].]]
After the mission's success, Balto and Kaasen became celebrities.
A statue of Balto, sculpted by [[Frederick Roth]], was erected in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]] on December 17, 1925, just 10 months after Balto's arrival in Nome.
Balto himself was present for the monument's unveiling.&lt;ref name=NYC&gt;{{cite web |title=Central Park Monuments - Balto |publisher=New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation |url=https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/central-park/monuments/751 |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue is located on the main path leading north from the [[Central Park Zoo|Tisch Children's Zoo]].&lt;ref name=CP&gt;{{cite web |title=Balto |publisher=Central Park Conservancy |url=http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/balto.html |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In front of the statue a low-relief slate plaque depicts Balto's sled team, and bears the following inscription:
{{cquote|Dedicated to the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that relayed antitoxin six hundred miles over rough ice, across treacherous waters, through Arctic blizzards from [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]] to the relief of stricken Nome in the Winter of 1925.

Balto was not destined to be a star in the breeding shed since he was neutered at a young age, hence he was relegated to being neglected on the [[vaudeville]] circuit with his team. When Kaasen wished to return home to Alaska, his dogs were sold to the highest bidder by the company who sponsored his tour.  The dogs ended up chained in a small area in a novelty museum and freak show in Los Angeles.

While visiting [[Los Angeles]], George Kimble, a former prize fighter turned businessman from Cleveland, was shocked to discover the dogs were unhealthy and badly treated. Mr. Kimble worked together with the newspaper ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' to bring Balto and his team to [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].  On March 19, 1927, Balto and six companions were brought to Cleveland and given a hero's welcome in a triumphant parade. The dogs were then taken to the Brookside Zoo (now the [[Cleveland Metroparks Zoo]]).

After Balto died in 1933, his remains were mounted by a taxidermist, and donated to the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref name=ClevelandHistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=B |title=Balto |accessdate=June 26, 2008 |work=Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher=Case Western Reserve University |date=March 27, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1965 [[Carl Barks]] introduced a hero dog named "Barko" as a character in an [[Uncle Scrooge]] comic book, ''[[North of the Yukon]]'', as an homage to Balto. In 1998 the Alaska Legislature passed HJR 62- 'Bring Back Balto' resolution. The Cleveland Museum of Natural History declined to return Balto; however, in October 1998, Balto left for a five-month stay at the [[Anchorage Museum of History and Art]] which drew record crowds. Balto was part of another exhibit at the Anchorage Museum of History and Art in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Laura |last=DeMarco |title=Cleveland's most famous canine, Balto, to visit Alaska |url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/02/post_158.html |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=February 13, 2017 |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1995 animated film [[Balto (film)|of the same name]] was also made, loosely depicting Balto's famous journey. This film portrayed him as a [[wolfdog|wolf-dog hybrid]] and is voiced by [[Kevin Bacon]].

'''Burton Stephen Lancaster''' (November 2, 1913 – October 20, 1994) was an American actor and producer. Initially known for playing "tough guys", he went on to achieve success with more complex and challenging roles. He was nominated four times for [[Academy Awards]], and won once for his work in ''[[Elmer Gantry (film)|Elmer Gantry]]'' in 1960. He also won a [[Golden Globe Award]] for that performance and [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] for ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'' (1962) and ''[[Atlantic City (1980 film)|Atlantic City]]'' (1980).

During the 1950s his production company [[Hecht-Hill-Lancaster]] was highly successful, making films such as ''[[Trapeze (film)|Trapeze]]'' (1956), ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' (1957), ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep (1958 film)|Run Silent, Run Deep]]'' (1958), and ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]'' (1958). The [[American Film Institute]] ranks Lancaster as #19 of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest male stars]] of classic Hollywood cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afi.com/100years/stars.aspx "AFI's 50 GREATEST AMERICAN SCREEN LEGENDS"] ''[[American Film Institute]].'' Retrieved: December 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Burton Stephen Lancaster was born on November 2, 1913, in [[Manhattan, New York]], at his parents' home at 209 East 106th Street, the son of Elizabeth (''née'' Roberts) and mailman James Henry Lancaster.&lt;ref name="buford p. 12"&gt;Buford 2008, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of his parents were [[Protestantism|Protestants]] of working-class origin. All four of his grandparents were [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants to the United States, from the province of [[Ulster]]; his maternal grandparents were from [[Belfast]] and were descendants of [[English people|English]] immigrants to Ireland.&lt;ref name="buford p. 12"/&gt; 

Lancaster grew up in [[East Harlem]] and spent much of his time on the streets, where he developed a great interest and skill in gymnastics while attending [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], where he was a basketball star. Before he graduated from DeWitt Clinton, his mother died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. Lancaster was accepted by [[New York University]] with an athletic scholarship, but subsequently dropped out.&lt;ref&gt;Buford 2008, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circus===
At 19, Lancaster met [[Nick Cravat]], with whom he developed a lifelong partnership. Together they learned to act in local theatre productions and circus arts at [[Union Settlement Association|Union Settlement]], one of the city's oldest settlement houses.&lt;ref&gt;Andreychuk 2005, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; They formed the acrobat duo Lang and Cravat in the 1930s, and soon joined the Kay Brothers circus. However, in 1939, an injury forced Lancaster to give up the profession, with great regret. He then found temporary work, first as a salesman for [[Marshall Fields]] and then as a singing waiter in various restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;Andreychuk 2005, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
With the United States having then entered [[World War II]], Lancaster joined the [[United States Army]] in 1942 and performed with the Army's 21st [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] Division, one of the military groups organized to follow the troops on the ground and provide [[USO]] entertainment to keep up morale. He served with General [[Mark W. Clark|Mark Clark]]'s [[United States Army North|Fifth Army]] in Italy from 1943 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Andreychuk 2005, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career==
===Broadway===
[[File:Killers001.jpg|left|thumb|With [[Ava Gardner]] in ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'' (1946)]]
Lancaster returned to New York after his Army service. Although initially unenthusiastic about acting, Lancaster was encouraged to audition for a Broadway play by a producer who saw him while he was visiting his then-girlfriend at work. The audition was successful and Lancaster was cast in [[Harry Brown (writer)|Harry Brown]]'s ''[[Eight Iron Men|A Sound of Hunting]]'' (1945). The show only ran three weeks, but his performance attracted the interest of a Hollywood agent, [[Harold Hecht]]. Lancaster had other offers but Hecht promised him the opportunity to produce their own movies within five years of hitting Hollywood. 

Through Hecht, Lancaster was brought to the attention of producer [[Hal B. Wallis]], who signed him to a non-exclusive eight-movie contract.

Lancaster's first filmed movie was ''[[Desert Fury]]'' (1947) for Wallis, where Lancaster was billed after [[John Hodiak]] and [[Lizabeth Scott]]. It was directed by [[Lewis Allen (director)|Lewis Allen]].&lt;ref name="Grossers1947"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/variety169-1948-01#page/n62/mode/1up "Top Grossers of 1947", ''Variety'', 7 January 1948 p 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

Then producer [[Mark Hellinger]] approached him to star in ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'' (1946), which was completed and released prior to ''Desert Fury''. Directed by [[Robert Siodmak]] it was a great critical success, and launched Lancaster and his co-star [[Ava Gardner]] to stardom. It has since come to be regarded as a classic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/variety165-1947-01#page/n54/mode/1up "60 Top Grossers of 1946", ''Variety'' 8 January 1947 p8]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hellinger used Lancaster again on ''[[Brute Force (1947 film)|Brute Force]]'' (1947), a prison drama written by [[Richard Brooks]] and directed by [[Jules Dassin]]. It was also well received.&lt;ref name="Grossers1947" /&gt; Wallis released his films through Paramount, and so Lancaster and other Wallis contractees made cameos in ''[[Variety Girl]]'' (1947).

Lancaster's next film was for Wallis, ''[[I Walk Alone]]'' (1947), a thriller co-starring Scott and a young [[Kirk Douglas]], who was also under contract to Wallis. It was a minor hit.&lt;ref name="Grossers1948"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/variety173-1949-01#page/n45/mode/1up "Top Grossers of 1948", ''Variety'' 5 January 1949 p 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lancaster had a change of pace with the film adaptation of [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[All My Sons (film)|All My Sons]]'' (1948), made at Universal with [[Edward G. Robinson]]. His third film for Wallis was an adaptation of ''[[Sorry, Wrong Number (film)|Sorry, Wrong Number]]'' (1948) with [[Barbara Stanwyck]].

===Norma Productions===
Hecht kept to his promise to Lancaster to turn producer. The two of them formed a company, Norma Productions, and did a deal with Universal to make a thriller in England, ''[[Kiss the Blood Off My Hands]]'' (1948) with [[Joan Fontaine]] and directed by Norman Foster. It was a commercial disappointment but critically acclaimed.&lt;ref name="Grossers1948" /&gt;

Back in Hollywood, Lancaster did another film noir with Siodmak, ''[[Criss Cross (film)|Criss Cross]]'' (1949). It was originally going to be produced by Hellinger and when Hellinger died another took over. [[Tony Curtis]] made an early appearance.

Lancaster did a fourth for Wallis, ''[[Rope of Sand]]'' (1949).

Norma Productions signed a three-picture deal with Warner Bros. The first was ''[[The Flame and the Arrow]]'' (1950), a swasbuckler movie, in which Lancaster drew on his circus skills. Nick Cravat had a support role and the film was a huge commercial success, making of $6 million. It was Warners' most popular film of the year and established an entirely new image for Lancaster.&lt;ref name="warners"&gt;Warner Bros financial information in The William Shaefer Ledger. See Appendix 1, Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, (1995) 15:sup1, 1-31 p 30 DOI: 10.1080/01439689508604551&lt;/ref&gt;

Lancaster was borrowed by [[20th Century Fox]] for ''[[Mister 880]]'' (1950), a comedy with [[Edmund Gwenn]]. MGM put him in a popular Western, ''[[Vengeance Valley]]'' (1951),&lt;ref name="Mannix"&gt;{{Citation | title = The Eddie Mannix Ledger | publisher = Margaret Herrick Library, Center for Motion Picture Study | place = Los Angeles}}.&lt;/ref&gt; then he went to Warners to pay the title role in the biopic ''[[Jim Thorpe -- All-American]]'' (1951).

===Halburt===
Norma signed a deal with Columbia to make two films through a Norma subsidiary, Halburt. The first film was ''[[Ten Tall Men]]'' (1951) where Lancaster was a member of the [[French Foreign Legion]]. [[Robert Aldrich]] worked on the movie as a production manager.

The second was a comedy ''[[The First Time (1952 film)|The First Time]]'' (1952), a comedy which was the directorial debut of [[Frank Tashlin]]. It was meant to star Lancaster but he wound up not appearing in the film - the first of their productions in which he did not act.)&lt;ref&gt;FILM ACTORS' UNION EXTENDS CONTRACT: Screen Guild Eases Pressure on Producers by Negotiating 6-Month Addition to Pact

===Hecht-Lancaster Productions===
In 1951 the actor/producer duo changed the company's name to Hecht-Lancaster Productions. The first film under the new name was another swashbuckler: ''[[The Crimson Pirate]]'' (1952), directed by Siodmak. Co-starring Cravat, it was extremely popular.

Lancaster changed pace one more by doing a straight dramatic part in ''[[Come Back, Little Sheba (1952 film)|Come Back, Little Sheba]]'' (1952), based on a Broadway hit, with [[Shirley Booth]], produced by Wallis and directed by [[Daniel Mann]]. 

Alternating with adventure films, he went into ''[[South Sea Woman]]'' (1952) at Warners. Part of the Norma-Warners contract was that Lancaster had to appear in some non-Norma films, of which this was one.&lt;ref&gt;Burt Breaks Mold When Typed: Burt Balks at Typed Film Roles

Lancaster played one of his best-remembered roles with [[Deborah Kerr]] in ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953) for Columbia, directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]]. The [[American Film Institute]] acknowledged the iconic status of the scene from that film in which he and Deborah Kerr make love on a Hawaiian beach amid the crashing waves. The organization named it one of "AFI's top 100 Most Romantic Films" of all time. Lancaster's performance earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, and the film would be one of the most critically acclaimed Lancaster ever made.

For his own company, Lancaster produced and starred in ''[[His Majesty O'Keefe]]'' (1954), a South Sea island tale shot in Fiji. It was co written by James Hill who would soon become a part of the Hecht-Lancaster partnership. &lt;ref&gt;LANCASTER TO STAR IN SHIPWRECK TALE: Norma Productions Buys 'His Majesty O'Keefe' for the Actor's First '52 Role By THOMAS F. BRADY New York Times 1 Jan 1951: 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Artists===
Hecht and Lancaster left Warners for [[United Artists]] for what began as a two-picture deal, the first of which was to be ''[[Apache (film)|Apache]]'' (1954), starring Lancaster as a Native American.&lt;ref&gt;BURT LANCASTER MAKES U.

They followed it with another Western, ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'' (1954) co starring [[Gary Cooper]] and produced by Hill. Both films were directed by [[Robert Aldrich]] and were hugely popular. 

United Artists signed Hecht-Lancaster to a multi-picture contract, to make seven films over two years.&lt;ref&gt;HOLLYWOOD SURPRISE by THOMAS M. PRYOR. New York Times 14 Feb 1954: X5. &lt;/ref&gt; These included films which Lancaster did not act in. Their first was ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' (1955), based on [[Paddy Chayefsky]]'s TV play starring [[Ernest Borgnine]] and directed by [[Delbert Mann]]. It won both the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and the [[Palme d'Or]] award at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. It also earned $2 million on a budget of $350,000.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;HOLLYWOOD DOSSIER: 'MARTY' HITS JACKPOT – TEAM – ON THE SET By OSCAR GODBOUT HOLLYWOOD.. New York Times 11 Sep 1955: X7.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vera Cruz'' had been a huge success but ''Marty'' secured Hecht-Lancaster as one of the most successful independent production companies in Hollywood at the time. &lt;ref name="tino"&gt;Tino Balio, ''United Artists: The Company That Changed the Film Industry'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1987 p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Without Hill, Hecht and Lancaster produced''[[The Kentuckian]]'' (1955) was directed by Lancaster in his [[directorial debut]]. He also played a lead role. Lancaster disliked directing and only did it once more, in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;'The Top Box-Office Hits of 1955', ''Variety Weekly'', January 25, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Lancaster still had commitments with Wallis, and made ''[[The Rose Tattoo (film)|The Rose Tattoo]]'' (1955) for him, starring with [[Anna Magnani]] and directed by Daniel Mann. It was very popular at the box office and critically acclaimed, winning Magnani an Oscar.&lt;ref&gt;'The Top Box-Office Hits of 1956', ''Variety Weekly'', January 2, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hecht-Hill-Lancaster===
In 1955 Hill was made an equal partner in the company and the name was upgraded to [[Hecht-Hill-Lancaster]], releasing their first film in 1956, ''[[Trapeze (film)|Trapeze]]'', in which Lancaster performed many of his own stunts. ''Trapeze'', co starring Tony Curtis and [[Gina Lollobrigida]], went on to become the production company's top box office success. United Artists expanded its deal with HHL.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, Thomas M. (1956). "Hecht-Lancaster Plans New Films: Producing Unit Signs Deal with United Artists—5 Features Are Listed Lancaster to Act". ''New York Times'', 13 April 1956. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1956 Lancaster and Hecht entered the music industry with the companies [[Hecht-Lancaster &amp; Buzzell Music]] and [[Calyork Music]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/50s/1957/Billboard%201957-03-16.pdf "Buzzell Ties with Hecht &amp; Lancaster", ''Billboard'', March 16 1957, p8]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "H-H-L" team impressed Hollywood with its success; as ''Life'' wrote in 1957, "[a]fter the independent production of a baker's dozen of pictures, it has yet to have its first flop ... (They were also good pictures.)." &lt;ref name="hodgins19570610"&gt;Hodgins, Eric. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nz8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA146  "Amid Ruins of an Empire a New Hollywood Arises."] ''Life,'' June 10, 1957, p. 146. Retrieved: April 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1957 they announced they would make ten films worth $14 million in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;"Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Planning Record Year: Group Will Produce $14,000,000 Worth of Motion Pictures in 1958". Los Angeles ''Times'', 16 Dec. 1957. p. B9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lancaster did two films for Wallis, to complete his eight film commitment for that produce: ''[[The Rainmaker (1956 film)|The Rainmaker]]'' (1956) with [[Katharine Hepburn]], which earned Lancaster a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor; and ''[[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (film)|Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]'' (1957) with Kirk Douglas, directed by [[John Sturges]], which was a huge commercial hit.

Lancaster worked with [[Tony Curtis]] again on ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' (1957), a co-production between Hecht-Hill-Lancaster and Curtis' own company Curtleigh Productions (co-owned with his wife, [[Janet Leigh]]). The movie, directed by [[Alexander Mackendrick]], was a critical success but a commercial disappointment. Over the years it has come to be regarded as one of Lancaster's greatest films.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Buford, ''Burt Lancaster: An American Life'', Da Capo 2000 p 183&lt;/ref&gt;

Hecht-Hill-Lancaster produced seven additional films in the late 1950s. Four starred Lancaster: ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep (1958 film)|Run Silent, Run Deep]]'' (1958), a war film with [[Clark Gable]], directed by [[Robert Wise]], which was mildly popular; ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]'' (1958), with Kerr and [[Rita Hayworth]] (who married James Hill), based on a play by [[Terence Rattigan]], which won Oscars for [[David Niven]] and [[Wendy Hiller]], and was a success; ''[[The Devil's Disciple (1959 film)|The Devil's Disciple]]'' (1959), with Douglas and [[Laurence Olivier]], which lost money (and saw Lancaster fire Mackendirck during shooting);&lt;ref&gt;"1959: Probable Domestic Take", ''Variety'', 6 January 1960 p 34&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Unforgiven (1960 film)|The Unforgiven]]'' (1960), with [[Audrey Hepburn]], which was a critical and commercial disappoiuntment.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 151-152 Larkins, Bob &amp;  Magers, Boyd ''The Films of Audie Murphy'' McFarland, 19 Aug. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Three were made without Lancaster, all of which lost money: ''[[The Bachelor Party]]'' (1957), from another TV play by Chayefsky, and directed by Delbert Mann; ''[[Take a Giant Step]]'' (1959), about a black student; and ''[[Summer of the Seventeenth Doll (film)|Summer of the Seventeenth Doll]]'' (1960), from an Australian play, shot in Australia and Britain. 

Additionally Hecht-Hill-Lancaster served as the production company for the 1960-1961 TV series ''[[Whiplash (TV series)|Whiplash]]''. 

The Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions company dissolved in 1960, after Hill ruptured his relation with both Hecht and Lancaster. &lt;ref&gt;Hill went on to produce a single additional film, ''[[The Happy Thieves]]'', in a new production company, Hillworth Productions, co-owned with his wife [[Rita Hayworth]]. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Hecht and Lancaster===
[[File:Burt Lancaster 1960.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of Lancaster after he won an Oscar for ''Elmer Gantry'' (1960). Artist: [[Nicholas Volpe]]]]
Lancaster played the title role in ''[[Elmer Gantry (film)|Elmer Gantry]]'' (1960), written and directed by Richard Brooks for United Artists. Lancaster won the 1960 Academy Award for Best Actor, a Golden Globe Award, and the [[New York Film Critics Award]] for his performance.

Hecht and Lancaster worked together on ''[[The Young Savages]]'' (1961), directed by [[John Frankenheimer]] and produced by Hecht. [[Sydney Pollack]] worked as a dialogue coach.

Lancaster starred in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961) for [[Stanley Kramer]] then did another with Hecht and Frankenheimer (replacing [[Charles Crichton]], ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'' (1962). The second film earned Lancaster a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Hecht went on to produce five films without Lancaster's assistance, through his company Harold Hecht Films Productions between 1961 and 1967, including another Academy Award winner, ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', starring [[Lee Marvin]] and [[Jane Fonda]].

===Collaborations with younger filmmakers===
Lancaster made ''[[A Child Is Waiting]]'' (1963) with [[Judy Garland]]. It was produced by Kramer and directed by [[John Cassavetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Tino|last=Balio|title=United Artists: The Company That Changed the Film Industry|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|date=1987|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went to Italy to star in ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|The Leopard]]'' (1963) for [[Luchino Visconti]], co-starring [[Alain Delon]] and [[Claudia Cardinale]]. It was one of Lancaster's favourite films and was a big hit in France but failed in the US (though the version released was much truncated.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buford|first=Kate|title=Burt Lancaster: An American Life|year=2000|publisher=Aurum|location=London|isbn=1-85410-740-2|pages=222–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a small role in ''[[The List of Adrian Messenger]]'' (1963) for producer/star Kirk Douglas, and then did two for Frankenheimer: ''[[Seven Days in May]]'' (1964), a political thriller with Douglas, and ''[[The Train (1964 film)|The Train]]'' (1964), a World War Two action film (Lancaster had Frankenheimer replace [[Arthur Penn]] several days into filming).

Lancaster starred in ''[[The Hallelujah Trail]]'' (1965), a comic Western produced and directed by [[John Sturges]] which failed to recoup its large cost.&lt;ref name="sturges"&gt;Glenn Lovell, ''Escape Artist: The Life and Films of John Sturges'', University of Wisconsin Press, 2008 p250&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a big hit with ''[[The Professionals (1966 film)|The Professionals]]'' (1966), a Western directed by Brooks and co-starring [[Lee Marvin]].

In 1966 At the age of 52, Lancaster appeared nude in director [[Frank Perry]]'s film ''[[The Swimmer (1968 film)|The Swimmer]]'' (1968), in what the critic [[Roger Ebert]] called "his finest performance".&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-swimmer-1968|title=Review: "The Swimmer"|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=July 2, 1968|accessdate=October 24, 2018|via=RogerEbert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to working on ''The Swimmer'', Lancaster was terrified of the water because he did not know how to swim. In preparation for the film, he took swimming lessons from [[University of California Los Angeles|UCLA]] swim coach Bob Horn.&lt;ref name="StoryOftheSwimmer"&gt;{{cite AV media|people=[[Chris Innis|Innis, Chris]]|url=http://grindhousereleasing.com/?tag=story-of-the-swimmer|chapter=The Story of The Swimmer|title=The Swimmer|publisher=[[Grindhouse Releasing]]|location=Los Angeles, California|edition=2014|format=Blu-ray/DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming was difficult and clashes between Lancaster and Perry led to [[Sydney Pollack]] coming in to do some filming.&lt;ref name=tcmart&gt;Stafford, Jeff [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/12842/The-Swimmer/articles.html "The Swimmer" (article)] on [[TCM.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; The film was not released until 1968, when it proved to be a commercial failure, though Lancaster remained proud of the movie and his performance.

===Norlan Productions===
[[File:Burt Lancaster - Audrey Hepburn - 1960.JPG|thumb|left|With [[Audrey Hepburn]] in ''[[The Unforgiven (1960 film)|The Unforgiven]]'' (1960)]]
In 1967, Lancaster formed a new partnership with [[Roland Kibbee]], who had already worked as a writer on five Lancaster projects; ''Ten Tall Men'', ''The Crimson Pirate'', ''[[Three Sailors and a Girl]]'' (in which Lancaster made a cameo appearance), ''Vera Cruz'' and ''The Devil's Disciple''. Through Norlan Productions, Lancaster and Kibbee produced ''[[The Scalphunters]]'' (1968), directed by Sydney Pollack.

Lancaster followed it with another film from Pollack, ''[[Castle Keep]]'' (1969), which was a big flop. So was ''[[The Gypsy Moths]]'' (1969] for Frankenheimer.&lt;ref&gt;"Big Rental Films of 1969", ''Variety'', 7 January 1970 p 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
Lancaster had one of the biggest successes of his career with ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970), one of the biggest box-office hits of 1970 and, at that time, reportedly the highest-grossing film in the history of [[Universal Pictures]].

He went into a series of Westerns: ''[[Lawman (film)|Lawman]]'' (1971) directed by [[Michael Winner]]; ''[[Valdez Is Coming]]'' (1971), for Norlan; and ''[[Ulzana's Raid]]'' (1972), directed by Aldrich and produced by himself and Hecht. None were particularly popular but ''Ulzana's Raid'' has become a cult film.&lt;ref name="aldrich"&gt;"I CAN'T GET JIMMY CARTER TO SEE MY MOVIE!"
Aldrich, Robert. Film Comment; New York Vol. 13, Iss. 2,  (Mar/Apr 1977): 46-52. &lt;/ref&gt;

Lancaster was top billed in ''[[Go Tell the Spartans]]'' (1978), a [[Vietnam War]] film; Lancaster admired the script so much he took a reduced fee and donated money to help the movie be completed. He was in ''[[Zulu Dawn]]'' (1979).&lt;ref&gt;Kate Buford, ''Burt Lancaster'' (Da Capo Press, 2000) {{ISBN|0-306-81019-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriages and relationships===
Lancaster vigorously guarded his private life. He was married three times. His first two marriages, to June Ernst from 1935 to 1946 and Norma Anderson from 1946 to 1969, ended in divorce. His third marriage, to Susan Martin, lasted from September 1990 until his death in 1994. All five of his children were with Anderson: [[Bill Lancaster|Bill]] (who became an actor and screenwriter), James, Susan, Joanna, and Sighle (pronounced "Sheila"). Friends say he claimed he was romantically involved with [[Deborah Kerr]] during the filming of ''From Here to Eternity'' in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Buford 2008, pp. 127–30.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kerr stated that while there was a spark of attraction, nothing ever happened.

===Legacy===
The [[centennial]] of Lancaster's birth was honored at New York City's [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]] in May 2013 with the screening of 12 of the actor's best-known films, from ''The Killers'' to ''Atlantic City''.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Holden|authorlink=Stephen Holden|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/movies/lots-of-lancaster-at-lincoln-center.html|title=Film: lots of Lancaster at Lincoln Center|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=May 12, 2013|accessdate=October 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Despite his [[Protestant]] background and upbringing, Lancaster identified himself as an [[atheist]] later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Kate |last=Buford|title=Burt Lancaster: An American Life|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=2001|ISBN=978-0306810190|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health problems and death==
[[File:Burt Lancaster grave at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Brentwood, California.JPG|thumb|Lancaster's grave]]
As Lancaster grew older, he became increasingly plagued by [[atherosclerosis]], barely surviving a routine [[gall bladder]] operation in January 1980. Following two minor [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], he had to undergo an emergency quadruple [[coronary bypass]] in 1983, after which he was extremely weak. However, he still managed to continue acting. In 1988, Lancaster was well enough to attend a Congressional hearing with old colleagues such as [[James Stewart]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] to protest against media magnate [[Ted Turner]]'s plan to [[colorize]] various black-and-white films from the 1930s and 1940s.

Lancaster's acting career ended after he suffered a stroke on November 30, 1990, which left him partly [[paralysis|paralyzed]] and largely unable to speak. He died in his apartment in [[Century City, Los Angeles|Century City, California]], from a third heart attack at 4:50 am on October 20, 1994, at the age of 80;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Oscar Winner Burt Lancaster Dies at 80| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-10-22/news/mn-56956_1_burt-lancaster| date=October 24, 1994| newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]| accessdate=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; just 13 days shy of his 81st birthday. He was cremated and his ashes were buried under a large oak tree in [[Westwood Memorial Park]] located in [[Westwood Village|Westwood Village, California]]. A small, square ground plaque inscribed only with "BURT LANCASTER 1913–1994" marks his final resting place. Upon his death, as he requested, he had no memorial or funeral service.
One of his final roles was that of [[Leon Klinghoffer]] in Voyage of Terror the Achille Lauro hijacking.

Costs for helpers include a [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] reduction, increased [[territory (animal)|territory]] defense, offspring guarding and an increased cost of growth. Benefits for helpers include a reduced chance of predation, increased foraging time, territory inheritance, increased environmental conditions and an inclusive fitness. Inclusive fitness is the sum of all direct and indirect fitness, where direct fitness is defined as the amount of fitness gained through producing offspring. Indirect fitness is defined as the amount of fitness gained through aiding related individuals offspring, that is relatives are able to indirectly pass on their genes through increasing the fitness of related offspring.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;Nicholas B. Davies, John R. Krebs, S. A. W. An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology.pdf. 522 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; This is also called kin selection.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982207014996|title=Evolutionary explanations for cooperation|last=West|first=Stuart|date=|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.06.004|volume=17|year=2007|journal=Current Biology|pages=R661–R672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the breeding pair, costs include increased [[mate guarding]] and suppression of subordinate mating. Breeders receive benefits as reductions in offspring care and territory maintenance. Their primary benefit is an increased reproductive rate and survival.

Cooperative breeding causes the reproductive success of all sexually mature adults to be skewed towards one mating pair. This means the [[reproductive fitness]] of the group is held within a select few breeding members and helpers have little to no reproductive fitness.&lt;ref name="Bartmann" /&gt; With this system, breeders gain an increased reproductive fitness, while helpers gain an increased inclusive fitness.&lt;ref name="Bartmann"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerlach | first1 = G. | last2 = Bartmann | first2 = S. | year = 1998 | title = Reproductive skew, costs, and benefits of cooperative breeding in female wood mice ( Apodemus sylvaticus ) | url = | journal = | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 408–418 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==

Many hypotheses have been presented to explain the [[evolution]] of cooperative breeding. The concept behind cooperative breeding is the forfeiting of an individual's reproductive fitness to aid the reproductive success of others. This concept is hard to understand and the evolution of cooperative breeding is important, but difficult to explain. Most hypotheses aim to determine the reason helpers selectively reduce their fitness and take on an alloparental role.

[[Kin selection]] is the evolutionary strategy of aiding the reproductive success of related organisms, even at a cost to the own individual's direct fitness. Hamilton's rule (rB−C&gt;0) explains that kin selection will exist if the genetic relatedness (r) of the aided recipient to the aiding individual, times the benefit to the aid recipient (B) is greater than the cost to the aiding individual(C).&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt; For example, the [[chestnut-crowned babbler]] (''Pomatostomus ruficeps'') has been found to have high rates of kin selection. Helpers are predominantly found aiding closely related broods over nonrelated broods.&lt;ref name="Browning" /&gt; Additional species such as ''[[Neolamprologus pulcher]]'' have shown that kin selection is a dominant driving force for cooperative breeding.&lt;ref name="Browning"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Browning | first1 = L. E. | last2 = Patrick | first2 = S. C. | last3 = Rollins | first3 = L. A | last4 = Griffith | first4 = S. C. | last5 = Russell | first5 = A F. | year = 2012 | title = Kin selection, not group augmentation, predicts helping in an obligate cooperatively breeding bird | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 279 | issue = | pages = 3861–9 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.1080| pmc = 3415917 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Group augmentation]] presents a second hypothesis towards the evolution of cooperative breeding. This hypothesis suggests that increasing the size of the group through the addition of helpers aids in individual survival and may increase the helper's future breeding success.&lt;ref name="Mares"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mares | first1 = R. | last2 = Young | first2 = A. J. | last3 = Clutton-Brock | first3 = T. H. | year = 2012 | title = Individual contributions to territory defence in a cooperative breeder: weighing up the benefits and costs | url = | journal = Proceedings: Biological Sciences | volume = 279 | issue = | pages = 3989–95 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.1071| pmc = 3427572 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Group augmentation is favored if the grouping provides passive benefits for helpers in addition to inclusive fitness.&lt;ref name="Kokko"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kokko | first1 = H. | last2 = Johnstone | first2 = R. A. | year = 2001 | title = The evolution of cooperative breeding through group augmentation | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 268 | issue = | pages = 187–196 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1349 | pmid=11209890 | pmc=1088590}}&lt;/ref&gt; By group augmenting, each individual member reduces their chances of becoming a victim of predation. Additionally, an increase in members reduces each helper's duration as a sentinel (standing upon a high surface to survey for predators) or babysitting (guarding the offspring and den). The reduction in these guarding behaviors enables helpers to forage for longer periods.&lt;ref name="Hatchwell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hatchwell | first1 = B. J. | year = 2009 | title = The evolution of cooperative breeding in birds: kinship, dispersal and life history | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 364 | issue = | pages = 3217–27 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0109| pmc = 2781872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lukas et al. proposed an evolutionary model for cooperative breeding, which linked the coevolution of polytocy, production of multiple offspring, and monotocy, production of single offspring, with the evolution of cooperative breeding. The model is based on the evolution of larger litters forcing the need for helpers to maintain the high reproductive costs, thus leading to cooperative breeding. Lukas et al. suggests polytocy may have encouraged the evolution of cooperative breeding. Their proposed model suggests the transition from monotocy to polytocy is favorable. Additionally, they found the transition from polytocy without cooperative breeding to polytocy with cooperative breeding is highly favorable. This suggests cooperative breeding evolved from noncooperative breeding monotocy to cooperative breeding polytocy.&lt;ref name="Lukas 2012" /&gt;

Today, there is growing support for the theory that cooperative breeding evolved by means of some form of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] or [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]].  Mutualism is a form of symbiosis that is beneficial to both involved organisms.  Mutualism has many forms and can occur when the benefits are immediate or deferred, when individuals exchange beneficial behaviors in turn, or when a group of individuals contribute to a common good, where it may be advantageous for all group members to help raise young.  When a group raises young together, it may be advantageous because it maintains or increases the size of the group.&lt;ref name="Clutton-Brock Science" /&gt;  The greatest amount of research has been invested in reciprocal exchanges of beneficial behavior through the [[iterated prisoner's dilemma]].  In this model, two partners can either cooperate and exchange beneficial behavior or they can defect and refuse to help the other individual.&lt;ref name="Clutton-Brock Science"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clutton-Brock|first=Tim|title=Breeding Together: Kin Selection and Mutualism in Cooperative Vertebrates|journal=Science|year=2002|volume=296|issue=5565|pages=69–72|doi=10.1126/science.296.5565.69|pmid=11935014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental conditions==

Environmental conditions govern whether offspring disperse from their natal group or remain as helpers. Food or territory availability can encourage individuals to disperse and establish new breeding territories, but unfavorable conditions promote offspring to remain at the natal territory and become helpers to obtain an inclusive fitness.&lt;ref name="Marino"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marino | first1 = J. | last2 = Sillero-Zubiri | first2 = C. | last3 = Johnson | first3 = P. J. | last4 = Macdonald | first4 = D. W. | year = 2012 | title = Ecological bases of philopatry and cooperation in Ethiopian wolves | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 1005–1015 | doi=10.1007/s00265-012-1348-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, remaining at the natal territory enables offspring to possibly inherit the breeding role and/or territory of their parents.&lt;ref name="Nichols 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nichols | first1 = H. J. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2012 | title = Food availability shapes patterns of helping effort in a cooperative mongoose | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 1377–1385 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A final factor influencing cooperative breeding is sexual dispersal. Sexual dispersal is the movement of one sex, male or female, from the natal territory to establish new breeding grounds. This is highly regulated by the reproductive costs in producing a male versus a female offspring. Maternal investment within female offspring may be considerably higher than male offspring for one species, or vice versa for another. During unfavorable conditions the cheaper sex will be produced at higher ratios.&lt;ref name="Sharp"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharp | first1 = S. P. | last2 = English | first2 = S. | last3 = Clutton-Brock | first3 = T. H. | year = 2012 | title = Maternal investment during pregnancy in wild meerkats | url = | journal = Evolutionary Ecology | volume =  27| issue = | pages =  1033–1044| doi = 10.1007/s10682-012-9615-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second factor affecting the sexual dispersal is the difference in ability of each sex to establish a new breeding territory. Carrion crow ([[Carrion crow|''Corvus corone'']]) were found to produce more female offspring in favorable environmental conditions. Female ''Corvus corone'' have been found to establish successful breeding territories at a higher rate than males. Male ''Corvus corone'' were produced at a higher rate under unfavorable conditions. Males were found to remain at the natal territory and become helpers.&lt;ref name="Vila"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Canestrari | first1 = D. | last2 = Vila | first2 = M. | last3 = Marcos | first3 = J. M. | last4 = Baglione | first4 = V. | year = 2012 | title = Cooperatively breeding carrion crows adjust offspring sex ratio according to group composition | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 1225–1235 | doi=10.1007/s00265-012-1375-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if environmental conditions favor the dispersal of a specific sex it is considered the dispersal sex. If environmental conditions are unfavorable females may produce the philopatric sex, therefore generating more helpers and increasing the occurrence of cooperative breeding.&lt;ref name="Vila" /&gt;

==Costs==

===Breeders===

Breeder costs consist of prenatal care, postnatal care and maintenance of breeding status. Prenatal care is the amount of maternal investment during fetus gestation and postnatal care is the investment following birth. Examples of prenatal care are fetal, placentae, uterus and mammary tissue development. Postnatal examples are lactation, food provisions and guarding behavior.&lt;ref name="Sharp" /&gt;

Dominant males and females exhibit suppressive behaviors towards subordinates to maintain their breeding status. These suppressive acts are dependent upon the sex ratio of helpers. Therefore, the costs will be altered depending upon the helpers. For example, if there are more male helpers as compared to females, then the dominant male will suppress subordinate males and experience a higher cost. The opposite is true for females. Breeders will even suppress subordinates from mating with other subordinates.&lt;ref name="Mitchell 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Jutzeler | first2 = E. | last3 = Heg | first3 = D. | last4 = Taborsky | first4 = M. | year = 2009 | title = Gender Differences in the Costs that Subordinate Group Members Impose on Dominant Males in a Cooperative Breeder | url = | journal = Ethology | volume = 115 | issue = | pages = 1162–1174 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2009.01705.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helpers===

The cost to helpers varies depending upon presence or absence of related offspring. The presence of offspring has been found to increase the helper’s cost by the helper contributing to guard behaviors.&lt;ref name="Santema"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Santema | first1 = P. | last2 = Clutton-brock | first2 = T. | year = 2013 | title = Meerkat helpers increase sentinel behaviour and bipedal vigilance in the presence of pups | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 655–661 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.12.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guarding behaviors, such as babysitting, can cause individuals to experience weight loss on an exponential scale depending upon the duration of the activity. Other activities, such as sentinel behavior and bipedal surveillance, cause helpers to have reduced foraging intervals inhibiting their weight gains. The reduced foraging behavior and increased weight loss reduces their chance to breed successfully, but increase their inclusive fitness by increasing the survival of related offspring.&lt;ref name="Bartmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brotheron 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brotherton | first1 = P. N. M. | last2 = Riain | first2 = J. M. O. | last3 = Manser | first3 = M. | last4 = Skinner | first4 = J. D. | year = 2013 | title = Costs of Cooperative Behaviour in Suricatas (Suricata Suricatta) | url = | journal = Proc Biol Sci | volume = 265 | issue = | pages = 185–190 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.1998.0281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hodge | first1 = S. J. | year = 2007 | title = Counting the costs: the evolution of male-biased care in the cooperatively breeding banded mongoose | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 911–919 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.09.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helpers contribute depending upon the cost. The act of helping requires an allocation of energy towards actually performing the behavior. Prolonged allocation of energy may greatly impact a helper’s growth.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; In banded mongoose ([[Banded mongoose|''Mungos mungo'']]) juvenile male helpers contribute far less than females. This is due to a difference in the age of sexual maturity.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; Female banded mongooses reach sexual maturity at one year of age, but males reach sexual maturity at two years of age. The difference in age causes the prolonged energy allocation to be detrimental to a specific sex.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt;

Male juvenile ''Mungos mungo'' may reduce helping behaviors until sexual maturity is reached. Similarly, if there is a lack of food due to environmental conditions, such as reduced rainfall, the degree of helper input may be reduced greatly within juveniles. Adults may maintain their full activity because they are sexually mature.&lt;ref name="Nichols 2012" /&gt;

Additionally, the costs of being a helper can be more detrimental to one sex. For example, territorial defense costs are generally male dependent and lactation is female dependent. Meerkats ([[Meerkat|''Suricata suricatta'']]) have exhibited male territory defense strategies, where male helpers will fend off intruding males to prevent such intruders from mating with subordinates or dominant females.&lt;ref name="Pauw"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pauw | first1 = A | year = 2000 | title = Parental care in a polygynous group of bat-eared foxes, Otocyon megalotis ( Carnivora : Canidae ) | url = | journal = African Zoology | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 139–145 | doi=10.1080/15627020.2000.11407200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, subordinate female pregnant helpers are sometimes exiled from the group by a dominant female.  This eviction causes the subordinate female to have an abortion, which frees up resources such as lactation and energy that can be used to help the dominant female and her pups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Rarely, a female helper or breeder will defend the territory while males are present. This suggests specific helping costs, such as territory defense, is rooted to one sex.&lt;ref name="Mares" /&gt;

==Benefits==

===Breeders===

Cooperative breeding reduces the costs of many maternal investments for breeding members. Helpers aid the breeding females with provisioning, lactation stress, guarding of offspring and prenatal investment.&lt;ref name="Mares" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichols 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nichols | first1 = H. J. | last2 = Amos | first2 = W. | last3 = Cant | last4 = Bell | first4 = M. B. V. | last5 = Hodge | first5 = S.

J. | last3 = Promislow | first3 = D. E. L. | year = 2007 | title = First evidence for heritable variation in cooperative breeding behaviour | url = | journal = Proceedings: Biological Sciences | volume = 274 | issue = | pages = 1757–61 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female helpers can aid in lactation, but all helpers, male or female, can aid in food provisioning.&lt;ref name="Nichols 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharp" /&gt; Helper food provisioning reduces the need for the dominant breeding pair to return to the den, thus allowing them to forage for longer periods. The dominant female and male will adjust their care input, or food provisioning, depending on the degree of activity of the helpers.&lt;ref name="Nichols 2012" /&gt;

The presence of helpers allows the breeding female to reduce her prenatal investment in the offspring, which may lead to [[altricial]] births; altricial is the production of young which are dependent upon adult aid to survive. This enables the breeding female to retain energy to be used within a new breeding attempt.&lt;ref name="Sharp" /&gt; Overall, the addition of helpers to a breeding pair encourages multiple reproductions per year, and increases the rate of successful reproduction.&lt;ref name="Charmantier" /&gt;

Male breeders can benefit directly from reproducing with subordinate females and aiding in raising the young. This allows the male to obtain a “repayment investment” within these subordinate offspring. These offspring have a higher chance to become helpers once sexual maturity is reached. Thus, paying into their care will increase the dominant male’s overall fitness in the future. This act ensures the dominant male subordinate helpers for future reproduction.&lt;ref name="Liedtke 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liedtke | first1 = J. | last2 = Fromhage | first2 = L. | year = 2012 | title = When should cuckolded males care for extra-pair offspring? | url = | journal = Proceedings: Biological Sciences | volume = 279 | issue = | pages = 2877–82 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.2691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helpers===

Helpers primarily benefit from an inclusive fitness.&lt;ref name="Lukas 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marino" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brotheron 2013" /&gt; Helpers maintain an inclusive fitness while aiding related breeders and offspring.&lt;ref name="Bartmann" /&gt;  This type of kinship may lead to inheritance of quality foraging and breeding territories, which will increase the future fitness of helpers.&lt;ref name="Sorato" /&gt; Additional, helpers experience an increased chance of being helped if they were once a helper.&lt;ref name="Charmantier" /&gt;

Finally, helpers benefit from group interactions, such as huddling for thermodynamic benefits. These interactions provide necessary elements to survive.&lt;ref name="Hatchwell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sorato"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sorato | first1 = E. | last2 = Gullett | first2 = P.

==Biological examples==

===Birds===
Approximately eight percent of bird species are known to regularly engage in cooperative breeding, mainly among the [[Coraciiformes]], [[Piciformes]], basal [[songbirds|Passeri]] and [[Sylvioidea]].&lt;ref name="uncertainty"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jetz | first1 = Walter | last2 = Rubinstein | first2 = Dustin R. | year = 2011 | title = Environmental Uncertainty and the Global Biogeography of Cooperative Breeding in Birds | url = http://www.columbia.edu/~dr2497/PUBLICATIONS_files/Jetz%26RubensteinCB.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Current Biology | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 72–8 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2010.11.075 | pmid=21185192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a small fraction of these, for instance the [[Australian mudnester]]s, [[Australo-Papuan babbler]]s and [[ground hornbill]]s, are however absolutely [[Obligate|''obligately'']] cooperative and cannot fledge young without helpers.&lt;ref&gt;See Cockburn, Andrew; [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/273/1592/1375.full "Prevalence of different modes of parental care in birds"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits of cooperative breeding in birds have been well-documented. One example is the [[azure-winged magpie]] (''Cyanopica cyanus''), in which studies found that the offspring’s cell-mediated immune response was positively correlated with increase in the number of helpers at the nest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valencia|first=Juliana|author2=Elena Solis |author3=Gabrielle Sorci |author4=Carlos de la Cruz |title=Positive correlation between [[Helpers at the nest|helpers at nest]] and nestling [[immune response]] in cooperative breeding bird|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=2006|volume=60|issue=3|pages=399–404 |doi=10.1007/s00265-006-0179-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on cooperative breeding in birds have also shown that high levels of cooperative breeding are strongly associated with low annual adult mortality and small clutch sizes, though it remains unclear whether cooperative breeding is a cause or consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnold|first=Kathryn E.|author2=Ian P. F. Owens|title=Cooperative breeding in birds: a comparative test of the life history hypothesis|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences|date=7 May 1998|volume=265|issue=1398|pages=739–745|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1689041/pdf/YR16ANRGCE6F70VL_265_739.pdf|pmc=1689041|doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0355}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally suggested that cooperative breeding developed among bird species with low mortality rates as a consequence of “overcrowding” and thus fewer opportunities to claim territory and breed. However, many observers today believe cooperative breeding arose because of the need for helpers to rear young in the extremely infertile and unpredictable environments&lt;ref&gt;See McMahon T.A. and Finlayson, B.; ''Global Runoff: Continental Comparisons of Annual Flows and Peak Discharges''. {{ISBN |3-923381-27-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Australia]] and [[sub-Saharan Africa]] under the rare favourable conditions.&lt;ref name="uncertainty"/&gt;

===Meerkats===
[[File:Suricata.suricatta.with.young.2.jpg|thumb|An older female watches over pups while alpha female is away.]]

[[Meerkat]]s become reproductively active at one year of age and can have up to four litters per year. However, usually it is the [[alpha (ethology)|alpha]] pair that reserves the right to mate and will usually kill any young that is not their own. While the alpha female is away from the group, females that have never reproduced lactate and hunt in order to feed the pups, as well as watch, protect, and defend them from predators. Although it was previously thought that a meerkat’s contribution to a pup’s diet depended on the degree of relatedness, it has been found that helpers vary in the number of food items they give to pups.  This variation in food offering is due to variation in foraging success, sex, and age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/267/1440/301.full.pdf|title=Individual Contributions to babysitting in a cooperative mongoose, Suricata suricatta|last=Clutton-Brock|first=T.H|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has additionally found that the level of help is not correlated to the kinship of the litters they are rearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clutton-Brock | first1 = T.H. | last2 = Brotherton | first2 = P.N.M. | last3 = O'Riain | first3 = M.J. | last4 = Griffin | first4 = A.S. | last5 = Gaynor | first5 = D. | last6 = Kansky | first6 = R. | last7 = Sharpe | first7 = L. | last8 = McIlrath | first8 = G.M. | year = 2000 | title = Contributions to cooperative rearing in meerkats | url = | journal = [[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 705–710 | doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primates==
Cooperative breeding entails one or more individuals, usually females, acting as "helpers" to one or a few dominant female breeders, usually helpers' kin. This sociosexual system is rare in primates, so far demonstrated among [[Callitrichidae|Neotropical callitricids]], including [[marmosets]] and [[tamarins]]. Cooperative breeding requires "repression" of helpers' reproduction, by pheromones emitted by a breeder, by coercion, or by self-restraint. [[Sarah Blaffer Hrdy]] believes that cooperative breeding is an ancestral trait in humans, a controversial proposition.

'''Crescent Porter Hale''' (1872–1937) was an [[United States|American]] industrialist who was involved in the [[Salmon cannery|canned salmon industry]] in [[Bristol Bay, Alaska]] throughout his adult life.

==Early life==
Born in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], CA as the 7th child of [[California Gold Rush|gold rush]] pioneer Titus Hale, the family moved to a farm on the lower Sacramento River in 1880. In 1885 Hale's sister Rose married a Sacramento cannery man, Joseph Peter Haller, who was hired to build the first cannery on Bristol Bay's [[Nushagak River]] earlier that year.  Haller was then asked by William Bradford to build another cannery across the river and when he returned to Alaska in 1886, he brought along his 14-year-old brother in law Crescent.

Crescent Hale, also known as Cress or Cres, returned to the Nushagak, near present-day [[Dillingham, AK]], in the summers that followed.  At the Bradford cannery, he was schooled in the salmon canning trade.  He was there in 1893 when all four Nushagak canneries merged with others to form the [[Alaska Packers Association]] (APA), a cannery cartel designed to control production and sell off surplus stockpiles of canned salmon.

At age 21, Cress was named superintendent of the Bradford cannery, later renamed the Diamond BB after the company name, the Bristol Bay Packing Co.  Hale caught the eye of competitors and in 1899 the Pacific Steam Whaling Company hired 27-year-old Cress to build a salmon cannery at [[Nushagak Point]] and serve as its first superintendent.

==North Alaska Salmon Company==
Then in 1900, Joseph Haller formed the North Alaska Salmon Company and returned to Bristol Bay with two of his brothers-in-law. Cress Hale was named general superintendent of Haller's company and Hale's brother William as bookkeeper.

Cress built two new canneries: one on the [[Kvichak River]] at a place named Hallerville and the other on the Egegik River across from the APA's Diamond E.  Two years later, he expanded North Alaska's holdings again, building the Lockenok Cannery at the confluence of the Kvichak and Alagnak Rivers and then returned to the Nushagak to establish a cannery at Ekuk.

The North Alaska Salmon Co. emerged as the biggest competitor to the APA and in 1903 briefly took the lead in a technological race to mechanize the salmon canning process.  Canning operations were mostly mechanized by the turn of the 20th century, except for cleaning the fish itself which was mostly done by Chinese workers.  Haller and Hale formed the Canners Machine Co. and allied with the Letson Burpee Co. of Seattle and ran its fish cleaning machines at all of its canneries.  Hale was awarded patent 798,334 for his improvements to the machine in 1905, but eventually the design of Edmund Augustine Smith, better known as the "Iron Chink," became the industry standard.

In 1906, Hale married Mabel Eugenie Jackson, a dance hall girl from [[Rochester, New York]] and three years later, they had their only child, Elwyn.  1909 also saw publication of the first novel written about Bristol Bay, ''The Silver Horde'' by [[Rex Beach]], and Cress Hale was assumed to be its inspiration.  It's doubtful that Hale and Beach ever met however and most of Beach's novels were formulaic [[potboiler]]s not drawn from real life but Cress Hale fit the bill.  ''The Silver Horde'' is the story of a young cannery superintendent who takes on the cannery trust dominated by Chicago meat packers.  At the time, Hale was superintendent of a company second only to the giant APA but the similarities end there.

Real life concerns kept Hale busy. After mudflats blocked access to the Lockenok cannery in 1912, Hale staked a homestead claim on the Alagnak River to provide the cannery with riverfront access, even though it required a short rail line to get to the cannery.  Likewise, the Hallerville cannery was plagued by mud flats.  It closed in 1913 and Hale built another cannery on Kvichak Bay just above Pederson Point and moved the Hallerville equipment there.

The salmon industry prospered early in the 20th century and the outbreak of the [[First World War]] created huge demand for salmon that soon pushed Bristol Bay's annual harvest over 20 million reds.  Joseph Haller, however, died of a heart ailment in 1915 and the North Alaska Salmon Co. was sold to Libby, McNeill and Libby, ironically a Chicago-based meat packing concern such as the antagonist in ''The Silver Horde''.  Hale's relocated Hallerville cannery was renamed Libbyville.

Cress Hale didn't sit idle for long.  Praised in the trade journals as "one of the best all around, competent cannerymen in Western Alaska," Hale bought the Alaska Salmon Company cannery on Wood River near Dillingham in 1916.  He organized under the name Northern Fisheries and in 1918 bought the Union Fish Company, a major cod-fishing concern with roots that traced back to the acquisition of Alaska from Russia. In 1923 he bought the Bristol Bay Packing Company cannery at Pederson Point near Naknek.

Hale recognized the potential of California sardines and bought the 420-foot Peralta in 1924 which he converted into a floating sardine reduction plant.  The Peralta was an experimental ship with a hull built out of concrete due to a shortage of steel during the First World War.

The 1920s were generally strong years for Bristol Bay salmon and Hale helped introduce popular culture to the region by showing movies at his Wood River cannery. The films attracted hundreds, including cannery workers and local residents.  Serials and westerns were popular as well as cartoons like [[Krazy Kat]] and [[Mickey Mouse]].

Hale produced his own promotional movie, shot and edited by his Wood River cannery superintendent Joe Hidzik.  Called Ice Kist Treasures after Hale's premier salmon brand, the film shows workers signing up, departing aboard cannery steamers, fishing boats, cannery operations and even a trip to the [[Wood-Tikchik State Park|Wood Tikchik lakes]].  A copy of the film is available at the J. Porter Shaw library at the [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park]].

As the roaring 20s came to a close, Cress Hale was nearing age 60 and after 40 years of canning salmon in Bristol Bay, he started thinking about retirement.  Quietly, Hale began talking about selling out.  He wanted $2.35 million and his timing seemed perfect.  The industry was strong and markets healthy but events beyond his control soon ran against him: the stock market crash of 1929 and the forecast of a poor salmon return in 1930.

The APA took an interest in Hale's operation primarily for access to his fishing boats, which were limited under a federal quota program.  When they offered just $1.4 million, Hale turned the offer down and struck a deal with to custom pack salmon for the A&amp;P Tea Company which also operated the Nakeen cannery on the Kvichak River.

==1936 fire==
The 1936 season was Cress Hale's 50th in Bristol Bay and it started off with all indications of a strong run of salmon.  By July 7, midway through the season, Hale had packed 40,000 cases but after he made his daily afternoon rounds through the Pederson Point cannery and settled into his office to deal with paperwork, all hell broke loose.

A fire started in a rear storage building and whipped by strong winds quickly spread through the wooden structure.  The complex of buildings lacked any fire breaks and even worse, the heat buckled pipes that supplied the cannery with water.  As fire hoses ran dry the fire spread unchecked from one building to the next.  No one was injured but the loss of the cannery and its salmon pack was total.  The cause of the fire was never determined.  The facility was insured but the insurance and legal issues involved were so complicated, the insurance industry wrote a book about it called ''The Bristol Bay Fire''.

Hale returned to his home in [[Piedmont, California]] started drawing up plans to rebuild.  His new design divided the canning lines into two separate buildings with a substantial fire break in between.  In late February, 1937, Hale wrote President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] warning about reports of Japanese plans to fish for Bristol Bay salmon.  Within a few months, the issue erupted into a major diplomatic dispute between the U.S. and Japan but Hale did not live to see it.

On March 29, 1937, Hale died at age 65 of what was reported as thrombosis or blood clots.  Mabel described his passing as, "A stanch ship sets sail for distant shores."  The book about the Bristol Bay fire was just coming off the press and his insurance brokers inserted a card that dedicated it to Hale.

==The cannery after Hale's death==
The rebuilding of the Pederson Point cannery took place as scheduled.  Mabel visited both the Pederson Point and Wood River canneries in 1937 and erected bronze plaques as memorials to its fallen superintendent.

Northern Fisheries reorganized with longtime VP Charlie Cocks as president and Elwyn Hale as secretary and manager.  Mabel also took an active role in the company.  Hale's canneries ran for the next three years but financial problems forced both to close after the 1939 season.  Mabel continued to court a buyer and finally in 1943, the two Bristol Bay canneries were sold to Alaska Pacific Salmon Company for $1.1 million.  The newly rebuilt Pederson Point cannery soon reopened under new leadership but the Wood River cannery was shuttered and dismantled.  The site sat vacant for 40 years until another processor took interest in the location for a freezer plant.

Mabel Eugenie Hale invested the earnings from her husband's fishing business in oil and potash leases and did quite well, amassing a small fortune that afforded her a comfortable home and a Rolls Royce.  She became a patron of the arts and education and in 1962 endowed a foundation which she named after her late husband.  The Crescent Porter Hale Foundation continues to this day and awards grants to Catholic schools and arts and education programs in the San Francisco area.

Mabel outlived Elwyn, who never married and died in 1974 at age 65.  Mabel Eugenie Hale lived to be 100.  She died in 1982.  Both the Peterson Point and Ekuk canneries remain operational today but Hale's other canneries have long since been dismantled or destroyed.  A freezer plant occupies the site of the Wood River cannery and was recently purchased by Snopac Products.  The Peralta and other World War I vintage concrete hulled ships remain afloat as part of a floating breakwater around a timber plant in Powell River, British Columbia.

'''Criticisms of [[marriage]]''' are arguments against the practical or moral value of the institution of matrimony or particular forms of matrimony. These have included the effects that marriage has on individual liberty, equality between the sexes, the relation between marriage and violence, philosophical questions about how much control can a government have over its population, the amount of control a person has over another, the financial risk when measured against the divorce rate, and questioning of the necessity to have a relationship sanctioned by government or religious authorities.{{clarify|reason=summary is stated much differently than the article is written.

==History==
[[File:Sylvia-Pankhurst 1.jpg|thumb|[[Sylvia Pankhurst]] (1882 – 1960), British feminist, refused to marry her son's father, creating public scandal.]]
In 380 BC, [[Plato]] criticised marriage in the ''[[Plato's Republic|Republic]]''. He stated that the idea of marriage was a "natural enemy" of the "commonwealth," aiming for its own higher unity.&lt;ref name="Plato"&gt;Sue Asscher, and David Widger (2008), [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1497/1497-h/1497-h.htm  The Republic by Plato.] The Project Gutenberg EBook. Retrieved August 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[industrial age]] a number of notable women writers including [[Sarah Fielding]], [[Mary Hays]], and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], raised complaints that marriage in their own societies could be characterized as little more than a state of "legal prostitution" with underprivileged women signing in to support themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Spector (2006), [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=yeTCcpFkeb8C |page=51 }} Prostitution and Pornography.] Stanford University Press, p. 51. Retrieved August 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Naomi Gerstel and Natalia Sarkisian wrote that marriage is also found to be often at odds with community, diminishing ties to relatives, neighbors, and friends.&lt;ref name="Pamela Haag-316"&gt;Naomi Gerstel &amp; Natalia Sarkisian, ''Marriage: The Good, the Bad, and the Greedy'', in [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=4R47k7Sb9i8C |page=61 }} ''The Lonely American: Drifting Apart in the Twenty-First Century''] by Jacqueline Olds and Richard S. Schwartz.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dan Moller's "Bachelor's Argument", modern marriage can be compared to the act of "forging professional credentials." Over 40 percent of them fail and therefore should be avoided similar to any high-risk venture.&lt;ref name="Moller-Brake"&gt;Dan Moller, ''An Argument Against Marriage'' in [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=YZtZwQuYx48C |page=126 }} ''Minimizing Marriage''] by Elizabeth Brake; also in ''Philosophy'', vol. 78, issue 303, Jan., 2003, p. 79 ''ff.'' {{doi|10.1017/S0031819103000056}} (author of Princeton Univ.), responded to in Landau, Iddo, ''An Argument for Marriage'', in ''Philosophy'', vol. 79, issue 309, Jul., 2004, p. 475 ''ff.'' (commentary) {{doi|10.1017/S0031819104000385}} (author of Haifa Univ., Israel), the latter responded to in Moller, Dan, ''The Marriage Commitment—Reply to Landau'', in ''Philosophy'', vol. 80, issue 312, Apr., 2005, p. 279 ''ff.''

Commentators have often been critical of individual local practices and traditions, leading to historical changes. Examples include the early [[Catholic Church]]'s efforts to eliminate [[concubinage]] and [[Probationary marriage in Scotland|temporary marriage]], the [[Protestant]] acceptance of [[divorce]], and the abolition of laws against inter-faith and inter-race marriages in the western countries.&lt;ref name="Kilbride-21"&gt;{{cite web | url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=vsgypbZWAo0C |page=14 }} | title=The Monogamous Ideal in Western Tradition and America | publisher=ABC-CLIO | work=Plural Marriage for Our Times: A Reinvented Option? | date=Aug 31, 2012 | accessdate=7 August 2013 | author=Philip L.

The decision not to marry is a presumed consequence of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s philosophy. His well-documented relationship with [[Regine Olsen]] is a subject of study in [[existentialism]], as he called off their engagement despite mutual love. Kierkegaard seems to have loved Regine but was unable to reconcile the prospect of marriage with his vocation as a writer and his passionate and introspective Christianity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

A similar argument is found in [[Franz Kafka]]'s journal entry titled "Summary of all the arguments for and against my marriage":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I must be alone a great deal. What I accomplished was only the result of being alone.&lt;ref&gt;Kafka, Franz. Summary of all the arguments for and against my marriage: From Kafka's Diaries, 12 July 1912...[http://www.mit.edu/~douglass/useful.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506110503/http://www.mit.edu/~douglass/useful.htm |date=2008-05-06 }}[http://www.woyano.com/view/7022/Summary-of-all-the-arguments-for-and-against-my-marriage-From-Kafkas-Diaries-12-July-1912] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201192352/http://www.woyano.com/view/7022/Summary-of-all-the-arguments-for-and-against-my-marriage-From-Kafkas-Diaries-12-July-1912 |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a high-profile couple, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] always expressed opposition to marriage. Brian Sawyer says "Marriage, understood existentially, proposes to join two free selves into one heading, thus denying the freedom, the complete foundation, of each self."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://briansawyer.net/2003/11/20/chapter-4-bad-faith-and-de-beauvoirs-gendered-self/|title=Chapter 4: Bad Faith and de Beauvoir's Gendered Self|author=|date=20 November 2003|website=briansawyer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, the high [[divorce rate]]s are leading to questioning of the purpose of marriage. Some contemporary critics of marriage question why governments (in Western countries) continue to support marriage, when it has such a high failure rate. Anthropologist [[Lionel Tiger]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |plainurl= |id=LtggAQAAMAAJ |title=Readings in Anthropology 80/81 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is astonishing that, under the circumstances, marriage is still legally allowed.  If nearly half of anything else ended so disastrously, the government would surely ban it immediately.  If half the tacos served in restaurants caused dysentery, if half the people learning karate broke their palms, if only 6 percent of people who went on roller coaster rides damaged their middle ears, the public would be clamoring for action. Yet the most intimate of disasters...happens over and over again.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to the passage of [[California Proposition 22 (2000)|California Proposition 22]] and the current controversy regarding [[same-sex unions in the United States]], a group of people have banded together to [[boycott]] marriage until all people can legally marry.  The argument is that since marriage is not an inclusive institution of society, the members of the boycott refuse to support the institution as it exists.&lt;ref name="Rofes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sperry"/&gt;

In the West, [[cohabitation]] and births outside marriage are becoming more common. In the [[United States]], [[conservative]] and [[religious]] commentators are highly critical of this trend. They are also often critical of present-day marriage law and the ease of divorce. [[John Witte, Jr.]], Professor of Law and director of the Law and Religion Program at Emory University, argues that contemporary liberal attitudes toward marriage produce a family that is "haphazardly bound together in the common pursuit of selfish ends" exactly as prophesied by Nietzsche.&lt;ref&gt;Witte Jr., John (1997). ''From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition.'' Westminster John Knox Press. pp. 39–40. {{ISBN|0-664-25543-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[From Sacrament to Contract]]'', Witte has argued that [[John Stuart Mill]]'s secular and ''contractarian'' model of marriage, developed during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], provided the theoretical justification for the present-day transformation of Anglo-American marriage law, promoting unqualified "right to divorce" on plaintiff's demand, one-time division of property, and child custody without regard for marital misconduct.&lt;ref name="Witte-215"&gt;{{cite book | url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=2fz0GTGUG3oC }} | title=From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition | year=2012 | accessdate=6 August 2013 | author=John Witte | page=215 | isbn=0664234321}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Catholic]] professor Romano Cessario, in a review of Witte's book published in an ecumenical journal the  ''[[First Things]]'', suggested that a solution to the current crisis of marriage in the West, could come from the possible revival of the sacramental marriage among Christians, thus counterbalancing Nietzsche's pessimism (as echoed by Witte).&lt;ref name="Jane Williams-Hogan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cesnur.org/2009/slc_hogan.htm | title=Marriage in Christian History | publisher=CESNUR | work=Marginalizing Heterosexual Monogamous Marriage | date=June 11–13, 2009 | accessdate=6 August 2013 | author=Jane Williams-Hogan (Bryn Athyn College)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism of marriage==
Some critics assert that marriage will always remain a symbolic institution signifying the subordination of women to men. Clare Chambers points to the sexist traditions surrounding marriage and weddings; she writes:&lt;ref name="citation.allacademic.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/4/1/2/5/p41259_index.html?phpsessid=f010300715dd72dcad0107c9ca4fd030|title=Recognizing Marriage as a Symbolic Institution|first=Chambers, Clare|last=E|date=1 September 2005|website=allacademic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Symbolically, the white wedding asserts that women's ultimate dream and purpose is to marry, and remains replete with sexist imagery: the white dress denoting the bride's virginity (and emphasising the importance of her appearance);  the minister telling the husband "you may now kiss the bride" (rather than the bride herself giving permission, or indeed initiating or at least equally participating in the act of kissing); the reception at which, traditionally, all the speeches are given by men; the wife surrendering her own name and taking her husband's.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The history of marriage in relation to women makes it an institution that some critics argue cannot and should not be accepted in the 21st century; to do so would mean to trivialize the abuses it was responsible for. Some critics argue that it is impossible to dissociate marriage from its past. Clare Chambers argues that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(...) it is impossible to escape the history of the institution. Its status as a tradition ties its current meaning to its past".&lt;ref name="citation.allacademic.com"/&gt; Past abuses of marriage are sometimes depicted in documentaries. A documentary in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] presented the story of elderly women who described their experiences with repeated acts of rape in marriage and the children born from these rapes, {{when|reason=need time frame|date=September 2013}} during the time when marital rape was not criminalized, contraception, abortion and divorce were all illegal, and the [[marriage bar]] restricting married women's employment outside home was in force. Marital rape in Ireland was made illegal in 1990, and divorce was legalized in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/readme/column-raped-for-years-many-older-women-can-only-now-tell-their-stories-407095-Apr2012/|title=Column: Raped for years, many older women can only now tell their stories|first=Bréid|last=Morris|date=|website=thejournal.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Violence against women==
&lt;!---the following should probably be placed in article Violence against women if not there already and rm from here. A distraction---&gt;
{{Further|Forced marriage|Child marriage|Honor killing|Stoning|Marital rape|Dowry|Bride price|Violence against women}}
[[Image:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|Anti-dowry poster in [[Bangalore, India]]. See [[dowry death]]]]

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] defines "violence against women" as ''"any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]] or [[emotional abuse|mental]] harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of [[liberty]], whether occurring in public or in private life."'' The 1993 [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] noted that this violence could be perpetrated by assailants of either gender, family members and even the "State" itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/(Symbol)/A.RES.48.104.En?Opendocument United Nations General Assembly ''Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women'' (1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of marriage argue that it is complicit in the mistreatment and subjugation of women across the world. Common concerns raised today focus on the health and general well-being of women, who, in parts of the world, have virtually no protection in law or in practice, against [[domestic violence]] within marriage. It is also nearly impossible for women there to get out of abusive relationships.&lt;ref name="F&amp;P"&gt;[http://fap.sagepub.com/content/14/2/327.extract The Need to Abolish Marriage.] ''Feminism &amp; Psychology'', May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UoC"&gt;Feminism Liberalism and Marriage. University of Cambridge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Abuses are upheld by claims of possession and entitlement in some cultures and the {{nobreak|well-being}} of women is undermined by a powerful act of subordination.&lt;ref name="F&amp;P" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UoC" /&gt; According to Gerstel and Sarkisian, domestic violence, isolation, and housework tend to increase for women who sign marriage contracts.&lt;ref name="GoodBadGreedy-p16"&gt;Gerstel, Naomi, ''et al.'', ''Marriage: The Good, the Bad, and the Greedy'', ''op. cit.'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Those with lower income draw even fewer benefits from it.&lt;ref name="GoodBadGreedy-p16" /&gt; Bad marriages, according to Gerstel and Sarkisian, result in higher levels of stress, suicide, hypertension, cancer, and slower wound healing in women.&lt;ref&gt;Gerstel, Naomi, ''et al.'', ''Marriage: The Good, the Bad, and the Greedy'', ''op. cit.'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of legal marriage contend that it encourages [[violence against women]], both through practices carried out within a marriage (such as [[domestic violence|beating]] and [[marital rape|rape]] inside marriage - which are legal in some countries and tolerated in many more), and through acts related to marital customs (such as [[honor killings]] for refusing [[arranged marriages]]; forcing rape victims to marry their rapist, [[marriage by abduction]]; or [[executions]] for [[sex outside marriage]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/38628_7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In some parts of the world, the extreme stigma cast on women who have reached a certain age and are still unmarried often leads these women to [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;Interviewees explained that societal pressures [to get married in Tajikistan] lead to suicide. A lawyer reported: "They try to quickly get their daughters married. There was a twenty-seven year old girl from the region, no one married her and the neighbors were laughing at her. She burned herself a month ago. Society makes fun of her because the first goal of the woman is to get married" [http://www.stopvaw.org/uploads/tajikistan_3_6_07_layout_-_final_mc.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide is also a common response of women caught in abusive marriages with no possibility of leaving those marriages.&lt;ref name="stopvaw.org"&gt;http://www.stopvaw.org/uploads/tajikistan_3_6_07_layout_-_final_mc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/2010/07/12/afghan-women-set-themselves-on-fire-to-escape-abusive-marriages.html|title=Afghan Women Set Themselves On Fire To Escape Abusive Marriages « RAWA News|author=|date=|website=www.rawa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who are faced with the prospect of [[forced marriage]] may commit suicide.&lt;ref name="stopvaw.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.hu.liu.se/ike/forskning/genus_medicin/vaw_global_network/publication/ruchira/1.54378/SpousalViolenceAgainstWomenandSuicidalIdeationinBangladesh2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-09-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928075353/https://www.hu.liu.se/ike/forskning/genus_medicin/vaw_global_network/publication/ruchira/1.54378/SpousalViolenceAgainstWomenandSuicidalIdeationinBangladesh2008.pdf |archive-date=2013-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwraw-ap.org/aboutus/pdf/FPvaw.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922173913/http://www.iwraw-ap.org/aboutus/pdf/FPvaw.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/afghan-women-escape-marriage-through-suicide/a-16750044|title=Afghan women escape marriage through suicide - DW - 18.04.2013|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|date=|website=DW.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence and [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] related to payment of [[dowry]] and [[bride price]] are also problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/3071963.stm | work=BBC News | first=Lucy | last=Ash | title=India's dowry deaths | date=16 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2013/210544.htm|title=Topics of Special Interest|author=|date=|website=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dowry deaths]] especially occur in [[South Asia]], and [[acid throwing]] is also a result of disputes related to dowry conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/violence-against-women-information|title=Gender, Sexuality, &amp; Identity – Amnesty International USA|author=|date=|website=amnestyusa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In various countries married men have authority over their wives. For instance, [[Yemen]]i marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.&lt;ref name="www2.ohchr.org"&gt;http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Iraq]] husbands have a legal right to punish their wives. The criminal code states that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right. Examples of legal rights include: "The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021100954/http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf |archivedate=October 21, 2012 }} Iraqi Penal Code, Paragraph 41&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] the Family Code states that the husband is the head of the household; the wife owes her obedience to her husband; a wife has to live with her husband wherever he chooses to live; and wives must have their husbands' authorization to bring a case in court or to initiate other legal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/drc/Congo0602-09.htm|title=THE WAR WITHIN THE WAR|author=|date=|website=www.hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of marriage argue that it is an institution which contributes to the maintaining of traditional gender roles, thus preventing women from achieving social equality, and reinforcing the idea that women exist to serve men, which in turn increases the abuse of women. They argue that marriage reinforces the traditional paradigm of male-female interaction: subordination of the woman to the man in exchange of subsistence. According to [[Sheila Jeffreys]] "the traditional elements of marriage have not completely disappeared in western societies, even in the case of employed, highly educated and well paid professional women".&lt;ref name="The Industrial Vagina"&gt;{{Google books |plainurl= |id=9mlFgjEBYWYC |title=The Industrial Vagina: The Political Economy of the Global Sex Trade |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that even such women remain in abusive marriages out of fear of leaving and out of duty. Even in Western countries, married women "feel they have no choice but to stay and endure and may be 'loving to survive".&lt;ref name="The Industrial Vagina" /&gt;

In various places, men have sexual authority over their wives, in law and in practice. The men decide when and where to have sex, and wives have no power to stop unwanted sex. In certain countries [[marital rape]] is legal, and even where it is illegal it is infrequently reported or prosecuted.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Often, married women also cannot stop [[unwanted pregnancy]], because in various countries modern [[contraception]] is not available, and in some countries married women need legal permission from the husband to use contraception (and even in countries where the husband's consent is not legally required in practice it is asked for), and [[abortion]] is illegal or restricted, and in some countries married women need the consent of husband for abortion. Therefore, marriage leads to a situation which allows not only forced sex, but also [[forced pregnancy]], and in some of these countries pregnancy and [[childbirth]] remain dangerous because of lack of adequate [[medical care]]. The effects of sexual violence inside marriage are exacerbated by the practice of [[child marriage]]; in 2013 an 8-years-old [[Yemen]]i girl died from internal bleeding after she was raped by her 40-year-old new husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/09/10/child_bride_8_dies_of_internal_bleeding_on_wedding_night_says_yemeni_activist.html | location=Toronto | work=The Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheila Jeffreys argues that the very institution of marriage is based on the idea that heterosexual sex is the absolute right of the man and the absolute duty of the woman; that men are entitled to demand sex on their terms and to coerce sex, and women are not allowed to ever refuse it. Lack of economic opportunity means that wives have no choice but to "allow sexual access to their bodies in return for subsistence".&lt;ref name="The Industrial Vagina"/&gt;

Violence related to female [[virginity]] is another problem. In many parts of the world it is socially expected for the bride to be a virgin; if the husband has sex with his wife after marriage and she does not bleed (it is possible for a woman to ''not'' bleed when she has sex for the first time &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/2372.aspx?CategoryID=118&amp;SubCategoryID=119|title=Does a woman always bleed when she has sex for the first time? - Health questions - NHS Choices|first=N. H. S.|last=Choices|date=12 July 2016|website=www.nhs.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;), this can end in extreme violence, including an honor killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.comparativelawreview.com/ojs/index.php/colr/article/viewfile/18/22 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044300/http://www.comparativelawreview.com/ojs/index.php/CoLR/article/viewFile/18/22 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw_legislation_2009/Expert%20Paper%20EGMGPLHP%20_Sherifa%20Zuhur%20-%20II_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The common view of marital life as "private" and outside the sphere of public intervention allows violence to flourish. [[Elizabeth Brake]] writes that ""privacy" protects unequal divisions of domestic labor, domestic violence, and exclusion of health coverage for abortion and contraception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=PyIdfgo5etAC }} |title=Minimizing Marriage: Marriage, Morality, and the Law |first=Elizabeth |last=Brake |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2012 |isbn=9780199774135}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Lyndon Shanley]] writes that police often "ignore complaints of domestic violence because they do not want to "intrude" on the private realm of the married couple".&lt;ref&gt;[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=J84NS0t9EC8C }} Just Marriage, by Mary Lyndon Shanley, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social isolation==
A criticism of marriage is that it may lead to the [[social isolation]] of a person, who is often expected to diminish other relations with friends, relatives or colleagues, in order to be fully dedicated to their spouse. [[Julie Bindel]] writes that:  "Maybe those at the most risk of ending up alone are not the folk who never marry, but rather the people who chuck all their eggs in one basket. [...] During their marriage, believing as they did that they only needed each other, both parties would have neglected friendships, or indeed, failed to cultivate new ones".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/18/what-if-i-never-get-married-google-answer|title=What if I never get married? You asked Google – here's the answer - Julie Bindel|first=Julie|last=Bindel|date=18 November 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in conservative cultures, married women are not allowed to leave home without the consent of the husband - a prohibition that is supported by the law itself in many of these countries. For instance, in Yemen marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.&lt;ref name="www2.ohchr.org"/&gt;

==Statutory==
A criticism of marriage is that it gives the state an undue power and control over the private lives of the citizens. The statutes governing marriage are drafted by the state, and not by the couples who marry under those laws. The laws may, at any time, be changed by the state without the consent (or even knowledge) of the married people. The terms derived from the principles of institutionalized marriage represent the interests of the governments.&lt;ref name="F&amp;P"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UoC"/&gt;

Critics of marriage argue that it is an institution based on control, domination and possession, and that attempting to exercise control over another person's life is immoral and dangerous, and should not be encouraged by the state. [[Claudia Card]], professor of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, writes that:&lt;ref&gt;http://pol285.blog.gustavus.edu/files/2009/08/Card_Against_Marriage.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The legal rights of access that married partners have to each other's persons, property, and lives makes it all but impossible for a spouse to defend herself (or himself), or to be protected against torture, rape, battery, stalking, mayhem, or murder by the other spouse... Legal marriage thus enlists state support for conditions conducive to murder and mayhem.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism of cultural attitudes relating to marriage==
Some commentators{{who|date=May 2014}} criticize government authorities for [[marriage promotion|promotion of marriage]]. They also criticize the [[romance (love)|romanticized]] image that marriage is given in films and [[romance novel]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Over 40% of books sold in America &lt;!---and probably elsewhere in the English-speaking world, and not excluding India--&gt;were romance novels.&lt;ref name="thurstonnewspaper"&gt;{{Cite news  | last =Thurston  | first =Carol  | title =The Liberation of Pulp Romances  | newspaper =Psychology Today  | date =April 1983  | format =PDF  | url =http://www.cherylclarke.net/cherylclarke.net%20folder/cherylclarke.net/pdf_files/Binder%2011.pdf  | accessdate =2007-05-24  | deadurl =yes  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070712042917/http://www.cherylclarke.net/cherylclarke.net%20folder/cherylclarke.net/pdf_files/Binder%2011.pdf  | archivedate =2007-07-12  | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics argue that people cannot form an objective image of what marriage is if they are from early childhood [[indoctrinated]] into believing marriage is desirable and necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |plainurl= |id=1YR8plajhwIC |page=257 |title= }}{{dead link|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publiceye.org/jeans_report/marriage-promotion-part-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://government.arts.cornell.edu/assets/faculty/docs/smith/nopromomarriage.23feb.pdf|title=Department of Government - Department of Government Cornell Arts &amp; Sciences|author=|date=|website=government.arts.cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=while this sentence has the most citations, it also suggests that all lessons learned in early childhood are wrong. Who gets to decide merit? Just the selected few critics of ideas with which they disagree?|date=May 2014}}

==Discrimination against certain groups of society==
Critics of marriage argue that this institution represents a form of state sponsored discrimination, in a generalized way against people who do not marry, and in a particular way against certain racial or ethnic groups who are less likely to marry and more likely to have children outside marriage, such as [[African Americans]] in the US - by stigmatizing such individuals, presenting their lifestyle as abnormal and denying them rights.&lt;ref name="organizingupgrade.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.organizingupgrade.com/index.php/modules-menu/beyond-capitalism/item/1002-marriage-will-never-set-us-free|title=Marriage Will Never Set Us Free - Organizing Upgrade|first=Dean Spade &amp; Craig|last=Willse|date=|website=www.organizingupgrade.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dean Spade]] and Craig Willse write that:&lt;ref name="organizingupgrade.com"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The idea that married families and their children are superior was and remains a key tool of anti-Black racism. Black families have consistently been portrayed as pathological and criminal in academic research and social policy based on marriage rates, most famously in the Moynihan Report.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Sexuality and the law==
{{See|Sexual ethics|Marital rape|Fornication|Premarital sex}}
Historically, in many cultures marriage has been used to regulate sexuality, rather than [[consent]] regulating it. That is, non-marital sex was banned regardless of consent, while marital sex was an enforceable obligation. From the mid-20th century onward, changing social norms have led to, among other things, the decriminalization of consensual non-marital sex and the criminalization of [[marital rape]]. These changes are not universal around the world, and in many countries they have not occurred. One of the concerns about marriage is that it may contradict the notion of sexual self-determination, due to cultural, religious, and in many countries also legal norms. For instance, sex outside marriage is still [[punishable by death]] in some jurisdictions. In 2014, Amnesty International's Secretary General stated that "It is unbelievable that in the twenty-first century some countries are condoning child marriage and marital rape while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activity – even punishable by death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2014/03/sexual-and-reproductive-rights-under-threat-worldwide/|title=Sexual and reproductive rights under threat worldwide|author=|date=|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue is the question on why relations that are (or are believed to be) sexual are favored in law with regard to legal protections and promotion, and those that are not (or are believed not to be) are not. This is especially the case as marriage rates are quite low in many Western countries, and the state has been criticized for ingoing other living arrangements that are not sexual relations; and there have been increased objections to legal concepts such as [[consummation]] or [[adultery]] that critics argue do not belong in modern law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''After Legal Equality: Family, Sex, Kinship''edited by Robert Leckey, Chapter 2,  ''Making family law less sexy ... and more careful'', by Jonathan Herring&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Body Lore and Laws Essays on Law and the Human Body'', edited by: Andrew Bainham, Shelley Day Sclater, Martin Richards, pp 171- 182&lt;/ref&gt;
It is argued that with regard to family life, the state should regulate the parental rights and responsibilities of parents, not focus on whether there is an ongoing sexual/romantic relation between the parents.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Feminist approach==
Feminist activists often point to historical, legal and social inequalities of [[wedding]], family life and [[divorce]] in their criticism of marriage. Sheila Cronan claimed that the freedom for women "cannot be won without the abolition of marriage."&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Cronan, "Marriage," in Koedt, Levine, and Rapone, eds., Radical Feminism, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; "The institution of marriage – wrote [[Marlene Dixon]] of the Democratic Workers Party – is the chief vehicle for the perpetuation of the oppression of women; it is through the role of wife that the subjugation of women is maintained".&lt;ref&gt;Marlene Dixon, [http://edweb.tusd.k12.az.us/UHS/APUSH/2nd%20Sem/ Articles%20Semester%202/8%20Dixon.htm  "Why Women's Liberation? Racism and Male Supremacy."]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrea Dworkin]] said that marriage as an institution, developed from rape, as a practice.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Early second wave of feminist literature in the West, specifically opposed to marriage include personalities such as [[Kate Millett]] (''[[Sexual Politics]]'', 1969), [[Germaine Greer]] (''[[The Female Eunuch]]'', 1970), [[Marilyn French]] (''[[The Women's Room]]'', 1977), [[Jessie Bernard]] (''The Future of Marriage'', 1972), and [[Shulamith Firestone]] (''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]: The Case for Feminist Revolution'', 1970).&lt;ref&gt;Why Congress Should Ignore Radical Feminist Opposition to Marriage

'''Augusto Caesar Amonsot''' (born August 30, 1985 in [[Tagbilaran City]], [[Bohol]], [[Philippines]]), more commonly known as '''Czar Amonsot''', is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] professional [[Boxing|boxer]].

==Boxing career==

===Early career===
On January 18, 2004, at the Gaisano Country Mall in [[Cebu City]], Philippines, Amonsot made his professional debut. He won by [[technical knockout]] against Rey Lomoljo in the fifth round of their scheduled six-round fight.

On May 29, 2004, after accumulating an undefeated record of 5 wins, 5 [[KO]]s, Amonsot made his international debut when he fought in unfamiliar territory in [[Uijeongbu]], [[South Korea]] against Kim-Jung Park. Impressively, Amonsot knocked out the latter in the second round of their scheduled eight-round fight.

After going back to the Philippines after his win against Park, Amonsot gained two more wins in his record. The first being against Nolasco Dan, the first opponent of Amonsot to survive the distance, and the other being the then [[Indonesia]]n [[Featherweight]] Champion Leed Shabu, whom Amonsot stopped in the sixth round.

Amonsot's next four fights were held in foreign territory, in the RCTI Studio in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. His first fight in the country was rather disappointing, with Amonsot suffering his first loss as a pro, losing by TKO to Simson Butar-Butar during the fifth round. His next fight wasn't a win either, but a draw against Joey De Ricardo after ten rounds. Finally, in the third fight of his four-fight campaign in Indonesia, Amonsot finally got back to his winning ways, registering a TKO win against Syamsul Hidayat in the fourth round. And in a rematch, Amonsot, in his final fight in Indonesia, defeated Leed Shabu once again, this time winning by a unanimous decision after ten rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boxing.com/the_czar_of_bohol.html|title=The Czar of Bohol|work=Boxing.com |author=Ted Sares|date=February 13, 2013|accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After registering two wins, a draw, and his first loss as a pro in Indonesia, Amonsot came back to the Philippines to defeat Jun Paderna and Richard Cabillo. He later went on to defeat the then undefeated [[WBO]] Asia Pacific [[Super Featherweight]] Champion Victor Mausul of Indonesia to earn his first regional belt.

On February 3, 2006, in [[The Orleans Hotel and Casino]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], Amonsot made his U.S. debut against [[Cristian Favela]] of [[Mexico]]. After eight rounds of action, Amonsot was awarded the victory, winning the bout by unanimous decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pinoy Fighters Invade Vegas in May - Boxing News|url = http://www.boxingscene.com/pinoy-fighters-invade-vegas---3626|website = www.boxingscene.com|accessdate = 2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amonsot won his next three fights after the win over Favela, beating the likes of Decho Kokietgym, Jose Reyes, and [[Silverio Ortiz]], accumulating a record of 17-1-1 with 10 victories coming by way of [[KO|knockout]].

===Rematch with Butar-Butar===
On September 23, 2006, Amonsot fought the same Simson Butar-Butar who gave him his first loss just about a year and a half ago, but this time, Amonsot had the home court advantage, the fight being held in his hometown of [[Tagbilaran City]], [[Bohol]]. The fight was to be fought for Amonsot's WBO Asia Pacific Super Featherweight belt, but due to Amonsot's failure to make weight during the weigh-in, weighing-in at a notorious five pounds over the limit, only Butar-Butar had the privilege to fight for the title.

Amonsot, to the dismay of the crowd, was embarrassed in front of his hometown fans, losing in just 47-seconds into the first round of the bout. Amonsot was caught flush by a right hook from Butar-Butar, sending him down. He tried to get up, but was counted out after he went down again, obviously disorientated from the punch that caught him right on the chin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-165614194.html|title=A second chance (The Scene Around)|author=Ed Picson|work=[[Manila Bulletin]]|date=June 26, 2007|accessdate=June 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fight with Michael Katsidis===
The fight that most fans know Amonsot for was his bloody war with [[Michael Katsidis]]. On July 21, 2007, Amonsot faced Katsidis for the interim WBO lightweight title at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas, [[Nevada]]. Amonsot lost a 12-round unanimous decision in a violent, back and forth struggle with the Australian Katsidis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/491309/old-pacquiao-foe-trains-amonsot|title=Old Pacquiao foe trains Amonsot|author=Rene Bonsubre Jr.|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer|Cebu Daily News]]|date=September 20, 2013|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered a brain bleed in that fight which many observers assumed would mark the end of his professional career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2949396|title=Brain bleed likely finishes Filipino boxer's U.S. career|author=Dan Rafael|work=ESPN|date=July 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, however, he continues to fight.

[[File:Avvakum by Pyotr Yevgenyevich Myasoyedov.jpg|thumb|The "[[baptism]] by fire" of [[Old Believer]] leader [[Avvakum]] in 1682]]

'''Death by burning''' is an execution method involving deliberately causing [[death]] through the effects of [[combustion]] or exposure to extreme heat. It has a long history as a form of [[capital punishment]], and many societies have employed it for activities considered criminal such as [[treason]], rebellious actions by slaves, [[heresy]], [[witchcraft]], [[arson]] (in Japan) and sexual transgressions, such as [[incest]] or [[homosexuality]].

The best known executions of this type are those where the condemned is bound to a large wooden stake and a fire lit beneath them. This is usually called '''burning at the stake''', or in some cases, ''[[auto-da-fé]]''. For burnings at the stake, if the fire was large (for instance, when a number of [[prison]]ers were [[executed]] at the same time), death often came from [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] before flames actually caused lethal harm to the body. If the fire was small, however, the condemned would burn for some time until death from [[hypovolemia]] (the loss of blood or other fluids, since extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, because the subsequent inflammatory response causes significant capillary fluid leakage and oedema), [[heatstroke]] or the simple [[thermal decomposition]] of vital body parts.&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tXywBrmhPTUC&amp;pg=PA67 pp. 67–68]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of death resulting from exposure to extreme heat are known. For example, pouring substances such as molten metal onto a person (or down their throat or into their ears), as well as enclosing persons within, or attaching them to, [[brazen bull|metal contraptions]] subsequently heated. Immersion in a heated liquid as a form of execution is considered distinct from death by burning, and classified as [[death by boiling]].

==Historical usage==

===Antiquity===

====Ancient Near East====

=====Old Babylonia=====
The 18th century BC law code promulgated by [[Babylonian King|Babylonian]] king [[Hammurabi]] specifies several crimes in which death by burning was thought appropriate. Looters of houses on fire could be cast into the flames, and priestesses who abandoned cloisters and began frequenting inns and taverns could also be punished by being burnt alive. Furthermore, a man who began committing incest with his mother after the death of his father could be ordered by courts to be burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Roth'' (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=awrOHv-gtqQC&amp;pg=PA5 p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ancient Egypt=====
In [[Ancient Egypt]], several incidents of burning alive perceived rebels are attested. For example, [[Senusret I]] (r. 1971–1926&amp;nbsp;BC) is said to have rounded up the rebels in campaign, and burnt them as human torches. Under the civil war flaring under [[Takelot II]] more than a thousand years later, the Crown Prince Osorkon showed no mercy, and burned several rebels alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Wilkinson'' (2011): Senusret I incident, [https://books.google.com/books?id=P07rgiJjsk4C&amp;pg=PA169 p. 169] Osorkon incident, [https://books.google.com/books?id=P07rgiJjsk4C&amp;pg=PA412 p. 412]&lt;/ref&gt; On the statute books, at least, women committing adultery might be burned to death. [[Jon Manchip White]], however, did not think capital judicial punishments were often carried out, pointing to the fact that the [[pharaoh]] had to personally ratify each verdict.&lt;ref&gt;''White'' (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GVhQ_lDWq0EC&amp;pg=PA167 p. 167]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] (fl. 1st century BC) asserts that the Egyptians had a particularly terrible punishment for children who murdered their parents: With sharpened reeds, bits of flesh the size of a finger were cut from the criminal's body. Then he was placed on a bed of thorns and burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/1D*.html 1.77.8], accessed at [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/home.html LacusCurtius]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Assyria=====
In the [[Middle Assyrian period]], paragraph 40 in a preserved law text concerns the obligatory unveiled face for the professional prostitute, and the concomitant punishment if she violated that by veiling herself (the way wives were to dress in public):
{{quote|A prostitute shall not be veiled. Whoever sees a veiled prostitute shall seize her ... and bring her to the palace entrance. ... they shall pour hot pitch over her head.&lt;ref&gt;''Schneider'' (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4hHLe60cYBcC&amp;pg=PA154 p. 154]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrians]], mass executions seem to have been not only designed to instill terror and to enforce obedience, but also as proof of their might. For example, Neo-Assyrian King [[Asuhurnasirpal II]] (r. 883–859 BC) was evidently proud enough of his bloody work that he committed it to monument and eternal memory as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''Olmstead'' (1918) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1946342 p. 66]&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|I cut off their hands, I burned them with fire, a pile of the living men and of heads over against the city gate I set up, men I impaled on stakes, the city I destroyed and devastated, I turned it into mounds and ruin heaps, the young men and the maidens in the fire I burned.}}

====Hebraic tradition====
In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 38, [[Judah (biblical person)|Judah]] orders [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]]—the widow of his son, living in her father's household—to be burned when she is believed to have become pregnant by an extramarital sexual relation. Tamar saves herself by proving that Judah is himself the father of her child. In the [[Book of Jubilees]], the same story is basically told, with some intriguing differences, according to Caryn A. Reeder. In Genesis, Judah is exercising his patriarchal power at a distance, whereas he and the relatives seem more actively involved in Tamar's impending execution.&lt;ref&gt;''Reeder'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PiNSpBdtsCgC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 82]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hebraic law, death by burning was prescribed for ten forms of sexual crimes: The imputed crime of Tamar, namely that a married daughter of a priest commits adultery, and nine versions of relationships considered as incestuous, such as having sex with one's own daughter, or granddaughter, but also, for example, to have sex with one's mother-in-law or with one's wife's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Full list in ''Quint'' (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2nEZQXWsXG4C&amp;pg=PA257 p. 257]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Mishnah]], the following manner of burning the criminal is described:
{{quote|The obligatory procedure for execution by burning: They immersed him in dung up to his knees, rolled a rough cloth into a soft one and wound it about his neck. One pulled it one way, one the other until he opened his mouth. Thereupon one ignites the (lead) wick and throws it in his mouth, and it descends to his bowels and sears his bowels.}}

That is, the person dies from being fed molten lead.&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from ''Ben-Menahem, Edrei, Hecht'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=J-ZE_BJpJnIC&amp;pg=PA111 p. 111]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mishnah is, however, a fairly late collections of laws, from about the 3rd century AD, and scholars believe it ''replaced'' the actual punishment of burning in the old biblical texts.&lt;ref&gt;On this view, see for example, ''Zvi Gilat, Lifshitz'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4h8iAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62, footnote 73]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ancient Rome====
In the 6th century AD collection of the sayings and rulings of the pre-eminent jurists from earlier ages, the [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]], a number of crimes are regarded as punishable by death by burning. The 3rd century jurist [[Ulpian]], for example, says that enemies of the state, and deserters to the enemy are to be burned alive. His rough contemporary, the juristical writer [[Callistratus (jurist)|Callistratus]] mentions that arsonists are typically burnt, as well as slaves who have conspired against the well-being of their masters (this last also, on occasion, being meted out to free persons of "low rank").&lt;ref&gt;See ''Watson'' (1998) '''Ulpian''', section 48.19.8.2, p. 361. '''Callistratus''', sections 48.19.28.11–12, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment of burning alive arsonists (and traitors) seems to have been particularly ancient; it was included in the [[Twelve Tables]], a mid-5th BC law code, that is, about 700 years prior to the times of Ulpian and Callistratus.&lt;ref&gt;''Kyle'' (2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=x4vekGBc_McC&amp;pg=PA53 p. 53]&lt;/ref&gt; According to ancient reports, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities executed many of the early [[Martyr#In Christianity|Christian martyrs]] by burning. An example of this is the earliest chronicle of a martyrdom, that of [[Polycarp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.iv.iv.html|title=ANF01. The Apostolic Fathers with Justin Martyr and Irenaeus - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|website=www.ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes this was by means of the ''[[tunica molesta]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Juvenal]] has an extended description of the tunica molesta, the punishment as meted out by Emperor [[Nero]] as contained in [[Tacitus]] matches the concept. See, for example ''Pagán'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bHzMYrWHjVoC&amp;pg=PA53 p. 53]&lt;/ref&gt; a flammable tunic:&lt;ref&gt;''Miley'' (1843), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iSsLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA223 pp. 223–224]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Siemiradski Fackeln.jpg|thumb|[[Nero's Torches]].]]

{{quote|... the Christian, stripped naked, was forced to put on a garment called the tunica molesta, made of papyrus, smeared on both sides with wax, and was then fastened to a high pole, from the top of which they continued to pour down burning pitch and lard, a spike fastened under the chin preventing the excruciated victim from turning the head to either side, so as to escape the liquid fire, until the whole body, and every part of it, was literally clad and cased in flame.}}

In AD 326, [[Constantine the Great]] promulgated a law that increased the penalties for parentally non-sanctioned "abduction" of their girls, and concomitant sexual intercourse/rape. The man would be burnt alive without the possibility of appeal, and the girl would receive the same treatment if she had participated willingly. Nurses who had corrupted their female wards and led them to sexual encounters would have molten lead poured down their throats.&lt;ref&gt;Law text found in ''Pharr'' (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=-ROBb7SIvYgC&amp;pg=PA244 pp. 244–245] The full law was changed in context to the penalties just 20 years later by Constantine's son, [[Constantius II]], for free citizens aiding and abetting in the abduction, to an unspecified "capital punishment". The full severity of the law was to be kept, however, for slaves. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-ROBb7SIvYgC&amp;pg=PA245 p. 245], ''ibidem''&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Constantine also passed a law that said if a woman married her own slave, both would be subjected to capital punishment, the slave by burning.&lt;ref&gt;Law text in [[Codex Justinianus]] 9.11.1, as referred to in ''Winroth, Müller, Sommar'' (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4smZ4JjGJcsC&amp;pg=PA107 p. 107]&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 390, Emperor Theodosius issued an edict against male prostitutes and brothels offering such services; those found guilty should be burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Pickett'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XH-SMq-NKf0C&amp;pg=PR21 p. xxi]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ritual child sacrifice in Carthage====
{{further|Religion in Carthage}}
[[File:Bardo National Museum tanit.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Tanit with a lion's head]]

Beginning in the early 3rd century BC, Greek and Roman writers have commented on the purported institutionalized [[child sacrifice]] the North African [[Carthaginians]] are said to have performed in honour of the gods [[Baal Hammon]] and [[Tanit]]. The earliest writer, [[Cleitarchus]] is among the most explicit. He says live infants were placed in the arms of a bronze statue, the statue's hands over a brazier, so that the infant slowly rolled into the fire. As it did so, the limbs of the infant contracted and the face was distorted into a sort of laughing grimace, hence called "the act of laughing". Other, later authors such as [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Plutarch]] says the throats of the infants were generally cut, before they were placed in the statue's embrace&lt;ref&gt;On ritual description, Plutarch, and in general, see ''Markoe'' (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=smPZ-ou74EwC&amp;pg=PA132 pp. 132–136] On Diodorus, see ''Schwartz, Houghton, Macchiarelli, Bondioli'' (2010), [http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0009177 Skeletal remains..do not support] on phrase "the act of laughing", see for example, ''Decker'' (2001), [http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/uc_decker_carthrel3.htm p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; In the vicinity of ancient Carthage, large scale grave yards containing the incinerated remains of infants, typically up to the age of 3, have been found; such graves are called "tophets". However, some scholars have argued that these findings are not evidence of ''systematic'' child sacrifice, and that estimated figures of ancient natural infant mortality (with cremation afterwards and reverent separate burial) might be the real historical basis behind the hostile reporting from non-Carthaginians. A late charge of the imputed sacrifice is found by the North African bishop [[Tertullian]], who says that child sacrifices were still carried out, in secret, in the countryside at his time, 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;'''Generally accepting''' the tradition of child sacrifice, see ''Markoe'' (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=smPZ-ou74EwC&amp;pg=PA132 pp. 132–136] '''Generally skeptical''', see ''Schwartz, Houghton, Macchiarelli, Bondioli'' (2010), [http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0009177 Skeletal remains..do not support]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Celtic traditions====
According to [[Julius Caesar]], the ancient [[Celts]] practiced the burning alive of humans in a number of settings. For example, in Book 6, chapter 16, he writes of the Druidic sacrifice of criminals within huge [[Wicker man|wicker frames shaped as men]]:
{{quote|Others have figures of vast size, the limbs of which formed of [[Salix viminalis|osiers]] they fill with living men, which being set on fire, the men perish enveloped in the flames. They consider that the [[oblation]] of such as have been taken in theft, or in robbery, or any other offence, is more acceptable to the immortal gods; but when a supply of that class is wanting, they have recourse to the oblation of even the innocent.}}

Slightly later, in Book 6, chapter 19, Caesar also says the Celts perform, on the occasion of death of great men, the funeral sacrifice on the pyre of living [[slaves]] and dependants ascertained to have been "beloved by them". Earlier on, in Book 1, chapter 4, he relates of the conspiracy of the nobleman [[Orgetorix]], charged by the Celts for having planned a ''coup d'état'', for which the customary penalty would be burning to death. It is said Orgetorix committed suicide to avoid that fate.&lt;ref&gt;''Julius Caesar, McDevitt, Bohn'' (1851) '''On penalty for conspiracy''', [https://books.google.com/books?hl=no&amp;id=7FsIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA4 p. 4] '''On criminals in large wicker frames''', [https://books.google.com/books?hl=no&amp;id=7FsIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA149 p. 149] '''On funeral human sacrifice''', [https://books.google.com/books?hl=no&amp;id=7FsIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=P150 pp.&amp;nbsp;150–151]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human sacrifice around the Eastern Baltic===
Throughout the 12th–14th centuries, a number of non-Christian peoples living around the Eastern [[Baltic Sea]], such as [[Old Prussians]] and [[Lithuanians]] were charged by Christian writers with performing human sacrifice. For example, [[Pope Gregory IX]] issued a [[papal bull]] denouncing an alleged practice among the Prussians, that girls were dressed in fresh flowers and wreaths and were then burned alive as offerings to evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;This case, and a number of others in ''Pluskowski'' (2013), pp.[https://books.google.com/books?id=-8NykshHHesC&amp;pg=PA77 77–78]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian states===
[[File:Filip2 albigensti.jpg|thumb|The burning of the [[Catharism|Cathar]] heretics]]

====Eastern Roman Empire====
Under 6th-century emperor [[Justinian I]], the death penalty had been decreed for impenitent [[Manicheans]], but a specific punishment was not made explicit. By the 7th century, however, those found guilty of "dualist heresy" could risk being burned at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamilton, Hamilton, Stoyanov'' (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uH-8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 p. 13, footnote 42]&lt;/ref&gt; Those found guilty of performing magical rites, and corrupting sacred objects in the process, might face death by burning, as evidenced in a 7th-century case.&lt;ref&gt;''Haldon'' (1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pSHmT1G_5T0C&amp;pg=PA333 p. 333, footnote 22]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 10th century AD, the Byzantines instituted death by burning for [[parricides]], i.e. those who had killed their own relatives, replacing the older punishment of ''[[poena cullei]]'', the stuffing of the convict in a leather sack along with a rooster, a viper, a dog and a monkey, and then throwing the sack into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;''Trenchard-Smith, Turner'' (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2ombkgpGt_AC&amp;pg=PA48 p. 48, footnote 58]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medieval Inquisition and the burning of heretics====
[[File:Templars Burning.jpg|left|thumb|Burning of the [[Knights Templar]], 1314]]

Civil authorities burned persons judged to be [[Heresy|heretics]] under the [[medieval]] [[Inquisition]].  Burning heretics had become customary practice in the latter half of the twelfth century in continental Europe, and death by burning became ''statutory'' punishment from the early 13th century. Death by burning for heretics was made positive law by [[Pedro II of Aragon]] in 1197. In 1224, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], made burning a legal alternative, and in 1238, it became the principal punishment in the Empire. In Sicily, the punishment was made law in 1231, whereas in France, [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] made it binding law in 1270.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/folkwaysastudys01sumngoog|title=Folkways|first=William Graham|last=Sumner|date=26 November 1979|publisher=New York : Arno Press|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As England in the 15th century grew weary of the teachings of [[John Wycliffe]] and the [[Lollards]], kings, priests, and parliaments reacted with fire. In 1401, Parliament passed the [[De heretico comburendo]] act, which can be loosely translated as "Regarding the burning of heretics." Lollard persecution would continue for over a hundred years in England. The [[Fire and Faggot Parliament]] met in May 1414 at [[Grey Friars Priory]] in [[Leicester]] to lay out the notorious [[Suppression of Heresy Act 1414]], enabling the burning of heretics by making the crime enforceable by the [[Justices of the peace]]. [[John Oldcastle]], a prominent Lollard leader, was not saved from the gallows by his old friend [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]]. Oldcastle was hanged and his gallows burned in 1417. [[Jan Hus]] was burned at the stake after being accused at the Roman Catholic [[Council of Constance]] (1414–18) of heresy. The ecumenical council also decreed that the remains of [[John Wycliffe]], dead for 30 years, should be exhumed and burned. (This [[posthumous execution]] was carried out in 1428.)

====Burnings of Jews====
[[File:Jews burned to death in Strasbourg Feb. 14 1349 during the Black Death.jpg|thumb|Jews burned to death in the Strasbourg massacre]]

Several incidents are recorded of massacres on Jews from the 12th through 16th centuries in which they were burned alive, often on account of the [[blood libel]]. In 1171 in [[Blois]], for example, 51 Jews were burned alive (the entire adult community). In 1191, King [[Philip Augustus]] ordered around 100 Jews burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;Both incidents in ''Weiss'' (2004), [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=oJOvpkHg7msC |page=104 }} p. 104]&lt;/ref&gt; That Jews purportedly performed [[host desecration]] also led to mass burnings; In 1243 in [[Beelitz]], the entire Jewish community was burnt alive, and in 1510 in Berlin, some 26 Jews were burnt alive for the same crime.&lt;ref&gt;''Prager, Telushkin'' (2007), [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=VK0llzUqQ2YC |page=87 }} p. 87]&lt;/ref&gt; During the "[[Black Death]]" in the mid-14th century a spate of large-scale [[Black Death Jewish persecutions|massacres]] occurred. One libel was that the Jews had [[well poisoning|poisoned the wells]]. In 1349, as panic grew along with the increasing death toll from the plague, general massacres, but also specifically mass burnings, began to occur. Six hundred (600) Jews were burnt alive in [[Basel]] alone. A large mass burning occurred in [[Strasbourg]], where several hundred Jews were burnt alive in what became known as the [[Strasbourg massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;''Kantor'' (2005)  [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=6uK5pa3R4d8C |page=203 |title=Codex Judaica: Chronological Index of Jewish History, Covering 5,764 Years of Biblical, Talmudic &amp; Post-Talmudic History }} p. 203]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Jewish male, Johannes Pfefferkorn, met a particularly gruesome death in 1514 in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]]. He had been charged with a number of crimes, such as having impersonated a priest for twenty years, performed [[host desecration]], stolen Christian children to be tortured and killed by other Jews, poisoning 13 people and poisoning wells. He was lashed to a pillar in such a way that he could run about it. Then, a ring of glowing coal was made around him, a fiery ring that was gradually pushed ever closer to him, until he was roasted to death.&lt;ref&gt;''Bülau'' (1860), [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=z4YBAAAAQAAJ |page=423 }} pp. 423–424]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Lepers' Plot of 1321====
Not only Jews could be victims of mass hysteria on charges like that of poisoning wells. This particular charge, well-poisoning, was the basis for a [[1321 leper scare|large scale hunt of lepers in 1321 France]]. In the spring of 1321, in [[Périgueux]], people became convinced that the local lepers had poisoned the wells, causing ill-health among the normal populace. The lepers were rounded up and burned alive. The action against the lepers didn't stay local, though, but had repercussions throughout France, not least because [[Philip V of France|King Philip V]] issued an order to arrest all lepers, those found guilty to be burnt alive. Jews became tangentially included as well; at [[Chinon]] alone, 160 Jews were burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Richards'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=saXbAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161 pp. 161–163]&lt;/ref&gt; All in all, around 5000 lepers and Jews are recorded in one tradition to have been killed during the Lepers' Plot hysteria.&lt;ref&gt;''John, Pope'' (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=-_fnv5pmECsC&amp;pg=PA177 p. 177]&lt;/ref&gt;

The charge of the lepers' plot was not wholly confined to France; existent records from England show that on [[Jersey]] the same year, at least one family of lepers were burnt alive for having poisoned others.&lt;ref&gt;''Smirke'' (1865), [https://books.google.com/books?id=G4dbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA326 pp. 326–331]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spanish Inquisition against Moriscos and Marranos====
[[File:Witch-scene4.JPG|thumb|The burning of a 16th-century Dutch [[Anabaptist]], Anneken Hendriks, who was charged with heresy.]]
The [[Spanish Inquisition]] was established in 1478, with the aim of preserving Catholic orthodoxy; some of its principal targets were "[[Marranos]]", formally converted Jews thought to have relapsed into Judaism, or the [[Moriscos]], formally converted Muslims thought to have relapsed into Islam. The public executions of the Spanish Inquisition were called [[autos-da-fé]]; convicts were "released" (handed over) to secular authorities in order to be burnt.

Estimates of how many were executed on behest of the Spanish Inquisition have been offered from early on; historian [[Hernando del Pulgar]] (1436–c. 1492) estimated that 2000 people were burned at the stake between 1478 and 1490.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Kamen]], ''The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision.'', p. 62, (Yale University Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates range from 30,000 to 50,000 burnt at the stake (alive or not) at the behest of the Spanish Inquisition during its 300 years of activity have previously been given and are still to be found in popular books.&lt;ref&gt;On mercy, and 50,000 estimate, for Marranos ''Telchin'' (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K7QH76_HdIC&amp;pg=PA41 p. 41] On 30,000 estimate of Marranos ''killed'', see ''Pasachoff, Littman'' (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=z4eaj09hscAC&amp;pg=PA151 p. 151]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1481, in what is said to be the first auto-da-fé, six Marranos were burnt alive in [[Seville]]. In November 1481, 298 Marranos were burnt publicly at the same place, their property confiscated by the Church.&lt;ref&gt;These information are included in the appendix, "Historical Notes" to the novel "The Hidden Scroll" ''Anouchi'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pbP-yZL00eAC&amp;pg=PT471 p. 471]&lt;/ref&gt; Not all Maranos executed by being burnt at the stake seem to have been burnt alive. If the Jew "confessed his heresy", the Church would show mercy, and he would be strangled prior to the burning. Autos-da-fé against Maranos extended beyond the Spanish heartland. In Sicily, in 1511–15, 79 were burnt at the stake, while from 1511 to 1560, 441 Maranos were condemned to be burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Cipolla'' (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Sggys-_O-2cC&amp;pg=PA91 p. 91]&lt;/ref&gt; In Spanish American colonies, autos-da-fé were held as well. For example, in 1664, a man and his wife were burned alive in [[Río de la Plata]], and in 1699, a Jew was burnt alive in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref&gt;''Stillman, Zucker'' (1993) '''On the Río de la Plata incident''', see ''Matilde Gini de Barnatan'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=yq7VUKWz5dwC&amp;pg=PA144 p. 144], '''on Mexico City incident''', see ''Eva Alexandra Uchmany'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=yq7VUKWz5dwC&amp;pg=PA128 p. 128]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1535, five Moriscos were burned at the stake on [[Majorca]], the images of a further four were also [[Burn in effigy|burnt in effigy]], since the actual individuals had managed to flee. During the 1540s, some 232 Moriscos were paraded in autos-da-fé in [[Zaragoza]]; five of those were burnt at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;''Carr'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=netlOtzI6R8C&amp;pg=PA101 p. 101]&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that out of 917 Moriscos appearing in autos of the Inquisition in [[Granada]] between 1550–95, just 20 were executed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/spanishinquisition2|title=The Spanish Inquisition A Historical Revision FOURTH EDITION By Henry Kamen|first=|last=Henry Kamen|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; seems at odds with the English government's state papers which claim that, while at war with Spain, they received a report from Seville of 17 June 1593 that over 70 of the richest men of Granada were burnt.&lt;ref&gt;List And Analysis of State Papers Foreign, Jul 1593 – Dec 1594. v.5; p.444 (595): by Public Record Office ({{ISBN|9780114402181}})&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1728 as many as 45 Moriscos were recorded burned for heresy.&lt;ref&gt;''Matar'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=z2QRd_rbWu8C&amp;pg=PR21 p. xxi]&lt;/ref&gt; In the May 1691 "bonfire of the Jews", Rafael Valls, Rafael Benito Terongi and [[Caterina Tarongí|Catalina Terongi]] were burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/07/world/europe/07iht-spain07.html|title=In Majorca, Atoning for the Sins of 1691|first=Doreen|last=Carvajal|publisher=|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nachman Seltzer,''Incredible'', Shaar Press, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portuguese Inquisition at Goa====
In 1560, the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] opened offices in the Indian colony [[Goa]], known as [[Goa Inquisition]]. Its aim was to protect Catholic orthodoxy among new converts to Christianity, and retain hold on the old, particularly against "Judaizing" deviancy. From the 17th century, Europeans were shocked at the tales of how brutal and extensive the activities of the Inquisition were.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} What modern scholars have established, is that some 4046 individuals in the time 1560–1773 received some sort of punishment from the Portuguese Inquisition, whereof 121 persons were condemned to be burned alive, of those 57 who actually suffered that fate, while the rest escaped it, and were burnt in effigy, instead.&lt;ref&gt;Already noted originally by ''Hunter'' (1886), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vdv7AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA253 pp. 253–254], see also ''Salomon, Sassoon, Saraiva'' (2001), pp. 345–347&lt;/ref&gt; For the Portuguese Inquisition in total, not just at Goa, modern estimates of persons actually executed on its behest is about 1200, whether burnt alive or not.&lt;ref&gt;See extensive table at [[Portuguese Inquisition]], ''de Almeida'' (1923), in particular p. 442&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation concerning "crimes against nature"====
[[File:Burning of Sodomites.jpg|left|thumb|Burning of two [[homosexuals]] at the stake outside [[Zürich]], 1482 ([[Spiezer Schilling]])]]

From the 12th to the 18th centuries, various European authorities legislated (and held judicial proceedings) against sexual crimes such as [[sodomy]] or [[bestiality]]; often, the prescribed punishment was that of death by burning. Many scholars think that the first time death by burning appeared within explicit codes of law for the crime of sodomy was at the ecclesiastical 1120 [[Council of Nablus]] in the [[Crusaders|crusader]] [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. Here, if public repentance were done, the death penalty might be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;See for '''first time''' ''Heng'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pRXvHbNLPQ0C&amp;pg=PA56 p. 56] on '''option of public repentance''' ''Puff, Bennett, Karras'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QThLAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA387 p. 387]&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, the earliest records for executions for the crime of sodomy are from the 13th–14th centuries, and it is noted there that the preferred mode of execution was death by burning. The Partidas of King Alfonso "El Sabio" condemned sodomites to be castrated and hung upside down to die from the bleeding, following the old testament phrase "their blood shall be upon them".&lt;ref&gt;''Pickett'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XH-SMq-NKf0C&amp;pg=PA178 p. 178]&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Geneva]], the first recorded burning of sodomites occurred in 1555, and up to 1678, some two dozen met the same fate. In [[Venice]], the first burning took place in 1492, and a monk was burnt as late as 1771.&lt;ref&gt;'''On Geneva and Venice''', see ''Coward, Dynes, Donaldson'' (1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=y8_Ya2s3zN8C&amp;pg=PA36 p. 36]&lt;/ref&gt; The last case in France where two men were condemned by court to be burned alive for engaging in consensual homosexual sex was in 1750 (although, it seems, they were actually strangled prior to being burned). The last case in France where a man was condemned to be burned for a murderous rape of a boy occurred in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;''Crompton'' (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TfBYd9xVaXcC&amp;pg=PA450 p. 450]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crackdowns and the public burning of a couple of homosexuals might lead to local panic, and persons thus inclined fleeing from the place. The traveller [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]] witnessed such a dynamic when he visited [[Malta]] in 1616 :{{quote|''The fifth day of my staying here, I saw a Spanish soldier and a Maltezen boy burnt in ashes, for the public profession of sodomy; and long before night, there were above an hundred bardassoes, whorish boys, that fled away to Sicily in a galliot, for fear of fire; but never one bugeron stirred, being few or none there free of it.''&lt;ref&gt;''Lithgow'' (1814), [https://books.google.com/books?id=whMwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA305 p. 305]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Augsburg-Perlachkirche.jpg|thumb|Perlachturm with [[St. Peter am Perlach|St.&amp;nbsp;Peter by Perlach]]]]
The actual punishment meted out to, for example, [[pederasts]] could differ according to status. While both in 1532 and 1409 [[Augsburg]] two men were burned alive for their offenses, a rather different procedure was meted out to four ''clerics'' in the 1409 case guilty of the same offence: Instead of being burnt alive, they were locked into a wooden casket that was hung up in the [[Perlachturm]] and they starved to death in that manner.&lt;ref&gt;''Osenbrüggen'' (1860), [https://books.google.com/books?id=X9NCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA290 p. 290]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The 1532 penal code of Charles V====
In 1532, Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] promulgated his penal code [[Constitutio Criminalis Carolina]]. A number of crimes were punishable with death by burning, such as coin forgery, arson, and sexual acts "contrary to nature".&lt;ref&gt;specified as men or women found guilty of same-sex sexual behaviour or guilty of having had sex with animals.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, those guilty of aggravated theft of sacred objects from a church could be condemned to be burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;As late as in 1730 [[Poznań|Posen]], a church robber had his right hand cut off, and the stump covered in pitch. Then, the pitch was ignited, and the person was burnt alive on a pyre as well. ''Oehlschlaeger'' (1866), [https://books.google.com/books?id=F41aAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA55 p. 55]&lt;/ref&gt; Only those found guilty of ''malevolent'' witchcraft&lt;ref&gt;No fixed penalty was placed on performing acts of witchcraft that had caused no harm&lt;/ref&gt; could be punished by death by fire.&lt;ref&gt;All in ''Koch'' (1824) '''Coin forgers''': [https://books.google.com/books?id=nBZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA52 Article 111, p. 52], '''Malevolent witchcraft''': [https://books.google.com/books?id=nBZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA55 Article 109, p. 55] '''Sexual acts contrary to nature''':[https://books.google.com/books?id=nBZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA58 Article 116, p. 58], '''Arson''':[https://books.google.com/books?id=nBZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA61 Article 125, p. 61], '''Theft of sacred objects''': [https://books.google.com/books?id=nBZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA84 Article 172, p. 84]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The last burnings from 1804 and 1813=====
According to the jurist {{Interlanguage link multi|Eduard Osenbrüggen|de}}, the last case he knew of where a person had been judicially burned alive on account of arson in Germany happened in 1804, in [[:de:Hötzelsroda|Hötzelsroda]], close by [[Eisenach]].&lt;ref&gt;''Osenbrüggen'' (1854), [https://books.google.com/books?id=C-4PAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA21 p. 21]  For a similar, more modern assessment, as well as locating the incident to Hötzelsroda, see Dietze (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The manner in which Johannes Thomas&lt;ref&gt;Last name "Mothas" used in extended account in ''Bischoff, Hitzig'' (1832), real name "Thomas" given in ''Herden'' (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wVNuf9VEhGkC&amp;pg=PA89 p. 89]&lt;/ref&gt; was executed on 13 July that year is described as follows: Some feet above the actual pyre, attached to a stake, a wooden chamber had been constructed, into which the delinquent was placed. Pipes or chimneys, filled with sulphuric material led up to the chamber, and that was first lit, so that Thomas died from inhaling the sulphuric smoke, rather than being strictly burnt alive, before his body was consumed by the general fire. Some 20,000 people had gathered to watch Thomas' execution.&lt;ref&gt;On the manner of execution according to the original account, see ''Bischoff, Hitzig'' (1832), [https://books.google.com/books?id=88dCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA178 p. 178] Contemporary newspaper notice, ''Hübner'' (1804), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jyVEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PT964 p. 760, column 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Thomas is regarded as the last to have been actually executed by means of fire (in this case, through suffocation), the couple Johann Christoph Peter Horst and his lover [[Friederike Luise Delitz|Friederike Louise Christiane Delitz]], who had made a career of robberies in the confusion made by their acts of arson, were condemned to be burnt alive in Berlin 28 May 1813. They were, however, according to [[Gustav Radbruch]], secretly strangled just prior to being burnt, namely when their arms and legs were tied fast to the stake.&lt;ref&gt;'''Original account''' by investigating police officer Heinrich L. Hermann, ''Hermann'' (1818) '''Gustav Rudbrach's mention''' ''Rudbrach'' (1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3JOVbGPdrjYC&amp;pg=PA247 p. 247] '''Precise moment of strangulation''' ''Gräff'' (1834), [https://books.google.com/books?id=v8ZDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA56 p. 56] '''Modern newspaper article''' ''Springer'' (2008), [http://www.yasni.de/ext.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.welt.de%2Fregionales%2Fberlin%2Farticle2489746%2FDas-letzte-Feuer.html&amp;name=Christiane+Delitz&amp;cat=news&amp;showads=1 Das Letzte Feuer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these two cases are the last where execution by burning might be said to have been ''carried out'' in some degree, Eduard Osenbrüggen mentions that ''verdicts'' to be burned alive were given in several cases in different German states afterwards, such as in cases from 1814, 1821, 1823, 1829 and finally in a case from 1835.&lt;ref&gt;''Osenbrüggen'' (1854), [https://books.google.com/books?id=C-4PAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA21 pp. 21–22, footnote 83]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Witch-hunts====
[[File:Wickiana5.jpg|thumb|Burning of three witches in [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]] (1585), painted by [[Johann Jakob Wick]]]]

Burning was used by Christians during the [[Witch-hunt#Early Modern Europe|witch-hunts of Europe]]. The penal code known as the [[Constitutio Criminalis Carolina]] (1532) decreed that sorcery throughout the [[Holy Roman Empire]] should be treated as a criminal offence, and if it purported to inflict injury upon any person the witch was to be burnt at the stake. In 1572, [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony]] imposed the penalty of burning for witchcraft of every kind, including simple fortunetelling.&lt;ref&gt;''Thurston'' (1912) [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm%20New%20Advent Witchcraft], 2010 web resource. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the latter half of the 18th century, the number of "[[Nine million victims|nine million witches]] burned in Europe" has been bandied about in popular accounts and media, but has never had a following among specialist researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Professional researchers in the 19th, and early 20th century tended to ''refuse'' giving any quantification at all but, when pushed, typically landed on about 100,000 to 1 million victims&lt;/ref&gt; Today, based on meticulous study of trial records, ecclesiastical and inquisitorial registers and so on, as well as on the utilization of modern statistical methods, the specialist research community on witchcraft has reached an agreement for roughly 40,000–50,000 people executed for witchcraft in Europe in total,&lt;ref&gt;A lowest bound of 30,000 and a highest upper bound of 100,000 still within acceptability, but with a minority of professional researchers supporting either of them.&lt;/ref&gt; and by no means all of them executed by being burned alive. Furthermore, it is solidly established that the peak period of witch-hunts was the century 1550–1650, with a slow increase preceding it, from the 15th century onward, as well as a sharp drop following it, with "witch-hunts" having basically fizzled out by the first half of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Wolfgang Behringer]] (1998) on the history of witch-counting, and on specialist academic consensus, [http://www.historicum.net/themen/hexenforschung/thementexte/rezeption/art/Neun_Millionen/html/ca/0e43e9dea3a4144c50997da6aa74bd34/ Neun Millionen Hexen] Originally published in GWU 49 (1998) pp. 664–685, web publication 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
In Denmark, after the [[Protestant Reformation|1536 reformation]], [[Christian IV of Denmark]] (r. 1588–1648) encouraged the practice of burning witches, in particular by the law against witchcraft in 1617. In [[Jutland]], the mainland part of Denmark,  more than half the recorded cases of witchcraft in the 16th and 17th centuries occurred after 1617.  Rough estimates says about a thousand persons were executed due to convictions for [[witchcraft]] in the 1500–1600s, but it is not wholly clear if all of the transgressors were burned to death.&lt;ref&gt;For Denmark, see for example, ''Burns'' (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qr6_q-chR6MC&amp;pg=PA64 pp. 64–65]&lt;/ref&gt;

====England====
[[Mary I of England|Mary I]] ordered hundreds of [[Protestants]] burnt at the stake during her reign (1553–58) in what would be known as the "[[List of Protestant martyrs of the English Reformation#List of Marian Martyrs|Marian Persecutions]]" earning her the epithet of 'Bloody' Mary.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Foxe]] is particularly mentioned in being assiduous at documenting such cases of persecutions. See, ''Miller'' (1972), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3S89AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA72 p. 72]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those martyred by Mary and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] are listed in ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Actes and Monuments]]'', written by Foxe in 1563 and 1570.
[[Edward Wightman]], a Baptist from [[Burton on Trent]], was the last person burned at the stake for [[heresy]] in England in [[Lichfield|Lichfield, Staffordshire]] on 11 April 1612.&lt;ref&gt;For claim of being last heretic burned at the stake, see for example, ''Durso'' (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=68jfRYQo3zsC&amp;pg=PA29 p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt; Although cases can be found of burning heretics in the 16th and 17th centuries England, that penalty for heretics was historically relatively new. For example, it did not exist in 14th century England, and when the bishops in England petitioned King [[Richard II]] to institute death by burning for heretics in 1397, he flatly refused, and no one was burnt for heresy during his reign.&lt;ref&gt;''Sayles'' (1971) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HVQLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA31 p. 31]&lt;/ref&gt; Just one year after his death, however, in 1401, [[William Sawtrey]] was burnt alive for heresy.&lt;ref&gt;''Richards'' (1812), [https://books.google.com/books?id=JRkwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1190 p. 1190]&lt;/ref&gt; Death by burning for heresy was formally abolished by King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1676.&lt;ref&gt;''Willis-Bund'' (1982), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2gA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA95 p. 95]&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional punishment for women found guilty of treason was to be [[Burning of women in England|burned at the stake]], where they did not need to be publicly displayed naked, whereas men were [[hanged, drawn and quartered]]. The jurist [[William Blackstone]] argued as follows for the differential punishment of females vs. males:
{{quote|For as the decency due to sex forbids the exposing and public mangling of their bodies, their sentence (which is to the full as terrible to sensation as the other) is to be drawn to the gallows and there be burned alive&lt;ref&gt;Direct citation in ''McLynn'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ylf8t7uSGJEC&amp;pg=PA122 p. 122]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, as described in Camille Naish's "Death Comes to the Maiden", in practice, the woman's shift would burn away at the beginning, and she would be left naked anyway.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} There were two types of treason, [[high treason]] for crimes against the sovereign, and [[petty treason]] for the murder of one's lawful superior, including that of a husband by his wife. Commenting on the 18th century execution practice, Frank McLynn says that most convicts condemned to burning were not burnt alive, and that the executioners made sure the women were dead before consigning them to the flames.&lt;ref&gt;''McLynn'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ylf8t7uSGJEC&amp;pg=PA122 p. 122]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last to have been condemned to death for "petty treason" was Mary Bailey, whose body was burned in 1784. The last woman to be convicted for "high treason", and have her body burnt, in this case for the crime of coin forgery, was [[Catherine Murphy (counterfeiter)|Catherine Murphy]] in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Comprehensive list at capitalpunishmentuk.org, [http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/burning.html Burning at the stake].&lt;/ref&gt; The last case where a woman was actually burnt alive in England is that of [[Catherine Hayes (murderer)|Catherine Hayes]] in 1726, for the murder of her husband. In this case, one account says this happened because the executioner accidentally set fire to the pyre before he had hanged Hayes properly.&lt;ref&gt;''O'Shea'' (1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=YvdKyEJo0osC&amp;pg=PA3 p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Rictor Norton]] has assembled a number of contemporary newspaper reports on the actual death of Mrs. Hayes, internally somewhat divergent. The following excerpt is one example: {{quote|The fuel being placed round her, and lighted with a torch, she begg’d for the sake of Jesus, to be strangled first: whereupon the Executioner drew tight the halter, but the flame coming to his hand in the space of a second, he let it go, when she gave three dreadful shrieks; but the flames taking her on all sides, she was heard no more; and the Executioner throwing a piece of timber into the Fire, it broke her skull, when her brains came plentifully out; and in about an hour more she was entirely reduced to ashes.&lt;ref&gt;See website article, [http://rictornorton.co.uk/grubstreet/hayes.htm The Case of Catherine Hayes] at [http://rictornorton.co.uk/ rictornorton.co.uk] See also the detailed synthesis at capitalpunishmentuk.org, [http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/hayes.html Catherine Hayes burnt for Petty Treason]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Scotland====
[[James VI of Scotland]] (later [[James I of England]]) shared the Danish king's interest in witch trials. This special interest of the king resulted in the [[North Berwick witch trials]], which led more than seventy people to be accused of witchcraft in [[Scotland]] due to inclement weather. James sailed in 1590 to Denmark to meet his betrothed, [[Anne of Denmark]], who, ironically, is believed by some to have secretly converted to Roman Catholicism herself from Lutheranism around 1598, although historians are divided on whether she ever was received into the Roman Catholic faith.&lt;ref&gt;"Some time in the 1590s, Anne became a Roman Catholic." ''Wilson'' (1963), p. 95 "Some time after 1600, but well before March 1603, Queen Anne was received into the Catholic Church in a secret chamber in the royal palace" ''Fraser'' (1997), p. 15  "The Queen ... [converted] from her native Lutheranism to a discreet, but still politically embarrassing Catholicism which alienated many ministers of the Kirk" ''Croft'' (2003), pp. 24–25 "Catholic foreign ambassadors—who would surely have welcomed such a situation—were certain that the Queen was beyond their reach. 'She is a Lutheran', concluded the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] envoy Nicolo Molin in 1606." ''Stewart'' (2003), p. 182 "In 1602 a report appeared, claiming that Anne ... had converted to the Catholic faith some years before. The author of this report, the Scottish [[Jesuit]] [[Robert Abercromby (missionary)|Robert Abercromby]], testified that James had received his wife's desertion with equanimity, commenting, 'Well, wife, if you cannot live without this sort of thing, do your best to keep things as quiet as possible.' Anne would, indeed, keep her religious beliefs as quiet as possible: for the remainder of her life—even after her death—they remained obfuscated." ''Hogge'' (2005), pp. 303–304&lt;/ref&gt;

The last to be executed as a witch in Scotland was [[Janet Horne]] in 1727, condemned to death for using her own daughter as a flying horse in order to travel. Janet Horne was burnt alive in a tar barrel.&lt;ref&gt;''Pavlac'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=KCjlptFEMZsC&amp;pg=PA145 p. 145]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====
[[Petronilla de Meath]] (c. 1300–1324) was the maidservant of Dame [[Alice Kyteler]], a 14th-century [[Hiberno-Norman]] noblewoman. After the death of Kyteler's fourth husband, the widow was accused of practicing [[witchcraft]] and Petronilla of being her accomplice. Petronilla was tortured and forced to proclaim that she and Kyteler were guilty of witchcraft. Petronilla was then flogged and eventually burnt at the stake on 3 November 1324, in [[Kilkenny]], Ireland.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''de Ledrede, Wright'' (1843)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de ''Ledrede, Davidson, Ward'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Hers was the first known case in the history of the [[British Isles]] of death by fire for the crime of [[heresy]]. Kyteler was charged by the [[Bishop of Ossory]], Richard de Ledrede, with a wide slate of crimes, from [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and [[demonism]] to the murders of several husbands. She was accused of having illegally acquired her wealth through [[witchcraft]], which accusations came principally from her stepchildren, the children of her late husbands by their previous marriages. The trial predated any formal witchcraft statute in Ireland, thus relying on [[canon law|ecclesiastical law]] (which treated witchcraft as [[heresy]]) rather than [[English common law]] (which treated it as a [[felony]]). Under torture, Petronilla claimed she and her mistress applied a magical ointment to a wooden beam, which enabled both women to fly. She was then forced to proclaim publicly that Lady Alice and her followers were guilty of witchcraft.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Some were convicted and whipped, but others, Petronilla included, were [[Burning at the stake|burnt at the stake]]. With the help of relatives, Alice Kyteler fled, taking with her Petronilla's daughter, Basilia.&lt;ref&gt;Story of flight in contemporary chronicle ''Gilbert'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=R_w-CZ0eXnYC&amp;pg=PR134 p. cxxxiv]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, [[Bridget Cleary]] (née Boland), a [[County Tipperary]] woman, was burnt by her husband and others, the stated motive for the crime being the belief that the real Bridget had been abducted by [[fairy|fairies]] with a [[changeling]] left in her place. Her husband claimed to have slain only the changeling. The gruesome nature of the case prompted extensive press coverage. The trial was closely followed by newspapers in both Ireland and Britain.&lt;ref name="McCullough-NYT"&gt;''McCullough'' (2000), [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4D91E3AF93BA35753C1A9669C8B63 The Fairy Defense]&lt;/ref&gt; As one reviewer commented, nobody, with the possible exception of the presiding judge, thought it was an ordinary murder case.&lt;ref name="McCullough-NYT"/&gt;

===Slavery and colonialism in the Americas===
[[File:Execution of Mariana de Carabajal.jpg|thumb|Execution of [[Francisca Nuñez de Carabajal|Mariana de Carabajal]] (converted Jew), Mexico City, 1601]]

====North America====
[[File:Modocs Scalping and Torturing Prisoners.jpg|thumb|Native Americans scalping and roasting their prisoners, published in 1873]]
Indigenous North Americans often used burning as a form of execution, against members of other tribes or white settlers during the 18th and 19th centuries. Roasting over a slow fire was a customary method.&lt;ref&gt;''Scott'' (1940) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; {See [[Captives in American Indian Wars]]}

In [[Massachusetts]], there are two known cases of burning at the stake. First, in 1681, a slave named Maria tried to kill her owner by setting his house on fire. She was convicted of arson and burned at the stake in [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]].&lt;ref name="Maria, Burned at the Stake"&gt;CelebrateBoston.com (2014), [http://www.celebrateboston.com/crime/puritan-burned-at-stake-maria.htm "Maria, Burned at the Stake"]&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, a slave named Jack, convicted in a separate arson case, was hanged at a nearby gallows, and after death his body was thrown into the fire with that of Maria. Second, in 1755, a group of slaves had conspired and killed their owner, with servants Mark and Phillis executed for his murder. Mark was hanged and his body [[gibbet]]ed, and Phillis burned at the stake, at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="Mark and Phillis Executions"&gt;[http://www.celebrateboston.com/crime/puritan-mark-and-phillis-executions.htm Mark and Phillis Executions] (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Montreal]], then part of [[New France]], [[Marie-Joseph Angélique]], a black slave, was sentenced to being burned alive for an arson which destroyed 45 homes and a hospital in 1734. The sentence was commuted on appeal to burning after death by stangulation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marie-Joseph Angélique]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=June 2018}}

In New York, several burnings at the stake are recorded, particularly following suspected slave revolt plots. In 1708, one woman was burnt and one man hanged. In the aftermath of the [[New York Slave Revolt of 1712]], 20 people were burnt (one of the leaders slowly roasted, before he died after 10 hours of torture&lt;ref&gt;''McManus'' (1973), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2H3S1OLtmagC&amp;pg=PA86 p. 86]&lt;/ref&gt;) and during the alleged [[New York Conspiracy of 1741|slave conspiracy of 1741]], at least 13 slaves were burnt at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoey'' (1974),[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/terror-new-york--1741 Terror in New York–1741]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bartolomé de las Casas]], a 16th-century eyewitness to the brutal subjugation of the Native Americans by the Spanish conquistadores, has left a particularly harrowing description of how roasting alive was a favoured technique of repression:&lt;ref&gt;''De las Casas'' (1974), [https://books.google.com/books?id=krP0qAvXK4QC&amp;pg=PA34 pp. 34–35]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|They usually dealt with the chieftains and nobles in the following way: they made a grid of rods which they placed on forked sticks, then lashed the victims to the grid and lighted a smoldering fire underneath, so that little by little, as those captives screamed in despair and torment, their souls would leave them. I once saw this, when there were four or five nobles lashed on grids and burning; I seem even to recall that there were two or three pairs where others were burning, and because they uttered such loud screams that they disturbed the captain's sleep, he ordered them to be strangled. And the constable, who was worse than an executioner, did not want to obey that order (and I know the name of that constable and know his relatives in Seville), but instead put a stick over the victims' tongues, so they could not make a sound, and he stirred up the fire, but not too much, so that they roasted slowly, as he liked.}}

The last known burning by the Spanish Colonial government in Latin America was of Mariana de Castro, in [[Lima, Peru]] {{Why?|date=November 2013}} in February 1732.&lt;ref&gt;''Carvacho'' (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?hl=no&amp;id=P30WGMWwsqMC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62] "y que habiendo llegado el caso de practicar lo determinado por el Consejo en auto de 4 de febrero de 1732, ... acordaron, después de revisar la causa de Mariana de Castro y lo determinado por la Suprema el 4 de febrero de 1732"&lt;/ref&gt;

====British West Indies====
In 1760, the slave rebellion known as [[Tacky's War]] broke out in [[Jamaica]]. Apparently, some of the defeated rebels were burned alive, while others were gibbeted alive, left to die of thirst and starvation.&lt;ref&gt;''Waddell'' (1863), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bt71nHmVezMC&amp;pg=PA19 p. 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1774, nine African slaves at [[Tobago]] were found complicit of murdering a white man. Eight of them had first their right arms chopped off, and were then burned alive bound to stakes, according to the report of an eyewitness.&lt;ref&gt;''Blake'' (1857), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6lDAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA154 pp. 154–155]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dutch Suriname====
In 1855 the Dutch abolitionist and historian [[:nl:Julien Wolbers|Julien Wolbers]] spoke to the Anti Slavery Society in Amsterdam. Painting a dark picture of the condition of slaves in Suriname, he mentions in particular that as late as in 1853, just two years previously, "three Negroes were burnt alive".&lt;ref&gt;''Woblers'' (1855), [https://books.google.com/books?id=WqcNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA205 p. 205]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek War of Independence===
The [[Greek War of Independence]] in the 1820s contained several instances of death by burning. When the Greeks in April 1821 captured a corvette near Hydra, the Greeks chose to roast to death the 57 Ottoman crew members. After the fall of [[Tripolitsa Massacre|Tripolitsa]] in September 1821, European officers were horrified to note that not only were Muslims suspected of hiding money being slowly roasted after having had their arms and legs cut off but, in one instance, three Muslim children were roasted over a fire while their parents were forced to watch. On their part, the Ottomans committed many similar acts; for example, in retaliation they gathered up Greeks in Constantinople, throwing several of them into huge ovens, baking them to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[William St Clair]], ''That Greece Might Still Be Free'' (2008) ''Hydra incident'', p. xxiv, ''those suspected of hiding money'', p. 45, ''the three Turkish children'', p. 77, ''baked in ovens'', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic countries===

====Followers of a false claimant of prophethood====
The Arab chieftain [[Tulayha|Tulayha ibn Khuwaylid ibn Nawfal al-Asad]] set himself up as a prophet in AD 630. Tulayha had a strong following which was, however, soon quashed in the so-called [[Ridda Wars]]. He himself escaped, though, and later was reconverted to Islam, but many of his rebel followers were burnt to death; his mother chose to embrace the same fate.&lt;ref&gt;''Zurkhana, Houtsma'' (1987), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wpM3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA830 p. 830]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=Please refer to a trustworthy sources, such as Muslims' classical books|date=December 2016}}

====Catholic monks in 13th-century Tunis and Morocco====
A number of monks are said to have been burnt alive in [[Tunis]] and [[Morocco]] in the 13th century. In 1243, two English monks, Brothers Rodulph and Berengarius, after having secured the release of some 60 captives, were charged with being English spies, and were burnt alive on 9 September. In 1262, Brothers Patrick and William, again having freed captives, but also sought to proselytize among Muslims, were burnt alive in Morocco. In 1271, 11 Catholic monks were burnt alive in Tunis. Several other cases are reported.&lt;ref&gt;''Digby'' (1853), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K06AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA342 pp. 342–345]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Converts to Christianity====

[[Apostasy in Islam|Apostasy]], i.e. the act of converting to another religion, was (and remains so in a few countries) punishable with death.
 
The French traveller [[Jean de Thevenot]], traveling the East in the 1650s, says: ''"Those that turn Christians, they burn alive, hanging a bag of Powder about their neck, and putting a [[Pitch (resin)|pitched]] Cap upon their Head."''&lt;ref&gt;''De Thevenot, Lovell'' (1687), [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=69&amp;id=6q9EAAAAcAAJ p. 69]&lt;/ref&gt; Travelling the same regions some 60 years earlier, [[Fynes Moryson]] writes:
{{quote|''A Turke forsaking his Fayth and a Christian speaking or doing anything against the law of [[Muhammad|Mahomett]] are burnt with fyer.''&lt;ref&gt;''Moryson, Hadfield'' (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fl6gkL5h6A0C&amp;pg=PA171 p. 171]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

(''NOTE:'' De Thevenot says Christians committing blasphemy against Islam were impaled, rather than burnt, if they do not convert to Islam.)

====Muslim heretics====

''[[Certain accursed ones of no significance]]'' is the term used by [[Taş Köprü Zade]] in the ''Şakaiki Numaniye'' to describe some members of the [[Hurufiyya]] who became intimate with the Sultan [[Mehmed II]] to the extent of initiating him as a follower. This alarmed members of the [[Ulema]], particularly Mahmut Paşa, who then consulted Mevlana Fahreddin. Fahreddin hid in the Sultan's palace and heard the [[Hurufi]]s propound their doctrines. Considering these heretical, he reviled them with curses. The [[Hurufi]]s fled to the Sultan, but Fahreddin's denunciation of them was so virulent that [[Mehmed II]] was unable to defend them. Farhreddin then took them in front of the [[Üç Şerefeli Mosque]], [[Edirne]], where he publicly condemned them to death. While preparing the fire for their execution, Fahreddin accidentally set fire to his beard. However the [[Hurufi]]s were burnt to death.

====Barbary States, 18th century====
[[John Braithwaite (author)|John Braithwaite]], staying in [[Morocco]] in the late 1720s, says that apostates from Islam would be burnt alive:
{{quote|''THOSE that can be proved after Circumcision to have revolted, are stripped quite naked, then anointed with Tallow, and with a Chain about the Body, brought to the Place of Execution, where they are burnt.''}}

Similarly, he notes that non-Muslims entering mosques or being blasphemous against Islam will be burnt, unless they convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;''Braithwaite''(1729)On apostates citation, see [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=366&amp;id=iJA_AAAAMAAJ p. 366], on the conditional fate of non-Muslims, see [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=355&amp;id=iJA_AAAAMAAJ p. 355]&lt;/ref&gt; The chaplain for the English in [[Algiers]] at the same time, [[Thomas Shaw (divine and traveller)|Thomas Shaw]], wrote that whenever capital crimes were committed either by Christian slaves or Jews, the Christian or Jew was to be burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Shaw'' (1757), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0c4GAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA253 p. 253]&lt;/ref&gt; Several generations later, in Morocco in 1772, a Jewish interpreter to the British, and a merchant in his own right, sought from the [[Mohammed ben Abdallah|Emperor of Morocco]] restitution for some goods confiscated, and was burnt alive for his impertinence. His widow made her woes clear in a letter to the British.&lt;ref&gt;''Stillman'' (1979), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bFN2ismyhEYC&amp;pg=PA310 pp. 310–311]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1792 in [[Ifrane]], Morocco, 50 Jews preferred to be burned alive, rather than convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;''Kantor'' (1993), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1SD_AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230 p. 230]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1794 in Algiers, the Jewish Rabbi Mordecai Narboni was accused of having maligned Islam in a quarrel with his neighbour. He was ordered to be burnt alive unless he converted to Islam, but he refused and was therefore executed on 14 July 1794.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.jewishgen.org/wconnect/wc.dll?jg~jgsys~josdates JOS Calendar Conversion Results], ''Hirschberg'' (1981), [https://books.google.com/books?id=g_mh5fuel0QC&amp;pg=PA20 p. 20]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1793, Ali Benghul made a short-lived ''coup d'état'' in [[Tripoli]], deposing the ruling [[Karamanli dynasty]]. During his short, violent reign he seized for example, the two interpreters for the Dutch and English consuls, both of them Jews, and roasted them over a slow fire, on charges of conspiracy and espionage.&lt;ref&gt;''Tully'' (1817), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QBkQAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA365 p. 365]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Persia====
During a famine in Persia in 1668, the government took severe measures against those trying to profiteer from the misfortune of the populace. Restaurant owners found guilty of profiteering were slowly roasted on spits, and greedy bakers were baked in their own ovens.&lt;ref&gt;''Ferrier'' (1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5CLkDgmVs1QC&amp;pg=PA94 p. 94]&lt;/ref&gt;

A physician, Dr C.J. Wills, traveling through [[Persia]] in 1866–81 noted that shortly before his (Wills') arrival, a "priest" had been burned alive. Wills wrote:&lt;ref&gt;''Wills'' (1891), [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL7180554M/In_the_land_of_the_lion_and_sun p. 204]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|''Just prior to my first arrival in Persia, the "Hissam-u-Sultaneh", another uncle of the king, had burned a priest to death for a horrible crime and murder; the priest was chained to a stake, and the matting from the mosques piled on him to a great height, the pile of mats was lighted and burnt freely, but when the mats were consumed the priest was found groaning, but still alive. The executioner went to Hissam-u-Sultaneh who ordered him to obtain more mats, pour naphtha on them, and apply a light, which 'after some hours' he did.''}}

===Roasting by means of heated metal===
The previous cases concern primarily death by burning through contact with open fire or burning material; a slightly different principle is to enclose an individual within, or attach him to, a metal contraption which is subsequently heated. In the following, some reports of such incidents, or anecdotes about such are included.

====The brazen bull====
[[File:Pierre Woeiriot Phalaris.jpg|thumb|Perillos being forced into the brazen bull that he built for Phalaris]]

Perhaps the most infamous example of a [[brazen bull]], which is a hollow metal structure shaped like a bull within which the condemned is put, and then roasted alive as the metal bull is gradually heated up, is the one allegedly constructed by Perillos of [[Athens]] for the 6th-century BC tyrant [[Phalaris]] at [[Agrigentum]], [[Sicily]]. As the story goes, the first victim of the bull was its constructor Perillos himself. The historian George Grote was among those regarding this story as having sufficient evidence behind it to be true, and points particularly to that the Greek poet [[Pindar]], working just one or two generations after the times of Phalaris refers to the brazen bull. A bronze bull was, in fact, one of the spoils of victory when the [[Carthaginians]] conquered Agrigentum.&lt;ref&gt;''Grote'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=62HlSNN2lqQC&amp;pg=PA305 p. 305, footnote 1]&lt;/ref&gt; The story of a brazen bull as an execution device is not wholly unique. About 1000 years later, for example, in AD 497, it can be read in an old chronicle about the [[Visigoths]] on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the south of France:
{{quote|[[Burdunellus]] became a tyrant in Spain and a year later was ... handed over by his own men and having been sent to [[Toulouse]], he was placed inside a bronze bull and burnt to death.&lt;ref&gt;Quote and extrapolation to be found in ''Collins'' (2004), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Fate of a Scottish regicide====
[[Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl]] was a Scottish nobleman complicit in the murder of King [[James I of Scotland]]. On 26 March 1437 Stewart had a red hot iron crown placed upon his head, was cut in pieces alive, his heart was taken out, and then thrown in a fire. A papal [[nuncio]], the later Pope [[Pius II]] witnessed the execution of Stewart and his associate [[Sir Robert Graham]], and, reportedly, said he was at a loss to determine whether the ''crime'' committed by the regicides, or the ''punishment'' of them was the greater.&lt;ref&gt;''Encycl. Perth.'' (1816), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VoJnKgmUH54C&amp;pg=PA131 p. 131, column 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

====György Dózsa on the iron throne====
[[File:GeorgheDoja.jpg|thumb|right|Dózsa's execution (contemporary woodcut)]]
[[György Dózsa]] led a peasants' revolt in Hungary, and was captured in 1514. He was bound to a glowing iron throne and a likewise hot iron crown was placed on his head, and he was roasted to death.&lt;ref&gt;''Klein'' (1833), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ppwAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA351 p. 351]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The tale of the murderous midwife====
In a few English 18th- and 19th-century newspapers and magazines, a tale was circulated about the particularly brutal manner in which a French midwife was put to death on 28 May 1673 in Paris. No fewer than 62 infant skeletons were found buried on her premises, and she was condemned on multiple accounts of abortion/infanticide. One detailed account of her supposed execution runs as follows:
{{quote|A gibbet was erected, under which a fire was made, and the prisoner being brought to the place of execution, was hung up in a large iron cage, in which were also placed sixteen wild cats, which had been catched in the woods for the purpose.—When the heat of the fire became too great to be endured with patience, the cats flew upon the woman, as the cause of the intense pain they felt.—In about fifteen minutes they had pulled out her intrails, though she continued yet alive, and sensible, imploring, as the greatest favour, an immediate death from the hands of some charitable spectator. No one however dared to afford her the least assistance; and she continued in this wretched situation for the space of thirty-five minutes, and then expired in unspeakable torture. At the time of her death, twelve of the cats were expired, and the other four were all dead in less than two minutes afterwards.}}

The English commentator adds his own view on the matter:{{quote|However cruel this execution may appear with regard to the poor animals, it certainly cannot be thought too severe a punishment for such a monster of iniquity, as could calmly proceed in acquiring a fortune by the deliberate murder of such numbers of unoffending, harmless innocents. And if a method of executing murderers, in a manner somewhat similar to this was adapted in England, perhaps the horrid crime of murder might not so frequently disgrace the annals of the present times.&lt;ref&gt;''Stevens'' (1764), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DIsfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA522 pp. 522–523]&lt;/ref&gt; }}
The English story is derived from a pamphlet published in 1673.&lt;ref&gt;For full title and provenance, see item 357 in ''Nassau'' (1824), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MDlbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA17 p. 17]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pouring molten metal down the throat or ears===

====Molten gold poured down the throat====
A number of stories concern individuals who are said to have been executed by having molten gold (melting point 1064&amp;nbsp;°C/1947&amp;nbsp;°F) poured down their throats. For example, in 88 BC, [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] captured the Roman general [[Manius Aquillius (consul 101 BC)|Manius Aquillius]], and executed him by pouring molten gold down his throat.&lt;ref&gt;''Steel'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ae63Gjp21SgC&amp;pg=PA98 p. 98]&lt;/ref&gt; A popular but unsubstantiated rumor also had the Parthians executing the famously greedy Roman general [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] in this manner in 53 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Licinius Crassus]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genghis Khan]] is said to have poured molten gold down the throat of a perfidious governor in 1220,&lt;ref&gt;''Saunders'' (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=nFx3OlrBMpQC&amp;pg=PA57 p. 57] According to the 13th-century historian [[Shihab al-Din Muhammad al-Nasawi|al-Nasawi]], the governor Inal Khan (who had assassinated the Mongol ambassadors and thus given Genghis Khan cause to invade), had the molten gold poured into his eyes and ears, rather than down his throat. ''Cameron, Sela'' (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=SAX5ohFkcVgC&amp;pg=PA128 p. 128]&lt;/ref&gt; and an early 14th-century chronicle mentions that his grandson [[Hulagu Khan]] did likewise to the sultan [[Al-Musta'sim]] after the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Baghdad in 1258]] to the Mongol army.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford regards the Hulagu story as a legend ''Crawford'' (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BfNqgYlo9fMC&amp;pg=PA149 p. 149]&lt;/ref&gt; (Marco Polo's version is that [[Al-Musta'sim]] was locked without food or water to starve in his treasure room)
[[File:Theodor de Bry 78.jpeg|thumb|[[Theodor de Bry]] engraving of a Conquistador being executed by gold]]
The Spanish in 16th-century Americas gave horrified reports that the Spanish who had been captured by the natives (who had learnt of the Spanish thirst for gold) had their feet and hands bound, and then molten gold poured down their throats as the victims were mocked: "Eat, eat gold, Christians".&lt;ref&gt;''Cummins, Cole, Zorach'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUKBQfzKlIYC&amp;pg=PA99 p. 99]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 19th century reports from the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] (present day [[Thailand]]) stated that those who have defrauded the public treasury could have either molten gold or silver poured down their throat.&lt;ref&gt;''Begbie'' (1834), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0MwNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA447 p. 447]&lt;/ref&gt;

====A punishment for inebriation and tobacco smoking====
The 16th-/early 17th-century prime minister [[Malik Ambar]] in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate]] would not tolerate inebriation among his subjects, and would pour molten lead (melting point 327&amp;nbsp;°C/621.43&amp;nbsp;°F) down the mouths of those caught in that condition.&lt;ref&gt;''Eaton'' (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DNNgdBWoYKoC&amp;pg=PA121 p. 121]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the 17th century [[Sultanate of Aceh]] Sultan [[Iskandar Muda]] (r. 1607–36) is said to have poured molten lead into the mouths of at least two drunken subjects.&lt;ref&gt;''Peletz'' (2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=q4TA4hjqjJ0C&amp;pg=PA28 p. 28]&lt;/ref&gt; Military discipline in 19th-century [[Burma]] was reportedly harsh, with strict prohibition of smoking [[opium]] or drinking [[arrack]]. Some monarchs, it appears, had ordained pouring molten lead down the throats of those who drank anyway, "but it has been found necessary to relax this severity, in order to conciliate the army"&lt;ref&gt;''Buckingham'' (1835), [https://books.google.com/books?id=qrhHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA250 p. 250]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah [[Safi of Persia|Safi I]] of Persia is said to have abhorred tobacco, and apparently in 1634, he prescribed the punishment of pouring molten lead into the throats of smokers.&lt;ref&gt;''Berger, Sicker'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4jjhnbu8ytEC&amp;pg=PA6 p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

====A Mongol punishment for horse thieves====
According to historian Pushpa Sharma, stealing a horse was considered the most heinous offence within the Mongol army, and the culprit would either have molten lead poured into his ears, or alternatively, his punishment would be the breaking of the spinal cord or beheading.&lt;ref&gt;''Sharma, Srivastava'' (1981), [https://books.google.com/books?id=nKJiBUFrmfoC&amp;pg=PA361 p. 361]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese tradition of Buddhist self-immolation===
Apparently, for many centuries, a tradition of devotional [[self-immolation]] existed among [[Buddhist]] monks in China. One monk who immolated himself in AD 527, explained his intent a year before, in the following manner:
{{quote|The body is like a poisonous plant; it would really be right to burn it and extinguish its life. I have been weary of this physical frame for many a long day. I vow to worship the buddhas, just like Xijian.&lt;ref&gt;''Benn'' (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dWL6EEkL8goC&amp;pg=PA3 p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A severe critic in the 16th century wrote the following comment on this practice:
{{quote|There are demonic people ... who pour on oil, stack up firewood, and burn their bodies while still alive. Those who look on are overawed and consider it the attainment of enlightenment. This is erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;''Benn'' (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dWL6EEkL8goC&amp;pg=PA198 pp. 198–199]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Japanese persecution of Christians===
{{further|Persecution of Christians in Japan}}
In the first half of the 17th century, Japanese authorities sporadically persecuted Christians, with some executions seeing persons being burnt alive. At [[Nagasaki]] in 1622, for example, some 25 monks were burnt alive,&lt;ref&gt;''Lee'' (2010),[https://books.google.com/books?id=LKj2B9vd7HsC&amp;pg=PA121 pp. 121–122]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Edo]] in 1624, 50 Christians were burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Matsumoto'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kF1sTidtP_sC&amp;pg=PA73 p. 73]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stories of cannibalism===

====Americas====
Even fateful encounters with cannibals are recorded: in 1514, in the Americas, Francis of Córdoba and five companions were, reportedly, caught, impaled on spits, roasted and eaten by the natives. In 1543, such was also the end of a previous bishop, [[Vincente de Valverde|Vincent de Valle Viridi]].&lt;ref&gt;''Perckmayr'' (1738), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3lpBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA628 p. 628]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fiji====
In 1844, the missionary John Watsford wrote a letter about the internecine wars on [[Fiji]], and how captives could be eaten, after being roasted alive:
{{quote|At Mbau, perhaps, more human beings are eaten than anywhere else. A few weeks ago they ate twenty-eight in one day. They had seized their wretched victims while fishing, and brought them alive to Mbau, and there half-killed them, and then put them into their ovens. Some of them made several vain attempts to escape from the scorching flame.&lt;ref&gt;''Calvert, Rowe'' (1858), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ov1EAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA258 p. 258]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The actual manner of the roasting process was described by the missionary pioneer David Cargill, in 1838:
{{quote|When about to be immolated, he is made to sit on the ground with his feet under his thighs and his hands placed before him. He is then bound so that he cannot move a limb or a joint. In this posture he is placed on stones heated for the occasion (and some of them are red-hot), and then covered with leaves and earth, to be roasted alive. When cooked, he is taken out of the oven and, his face and other parts being painted black, that he may resemble a living man ornamented for a feast or for war, he is carried to the temple of the gods and, being still retained in a sitting posture, is offered as a propitiatory sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Hogg'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Immolation of widows===

====Indian subcontinent====
{{main|Sati (practice)|l1=Sati}}
[[File:A Hindoo Widow Burning Herself with the Corpse of her Husband.jpg|thumb|A [[Hindu]] widow burning herself with the corpse of her husband, 1820s]]
[[File:Burning of a Widow.jpg|thumb|''Ceremony of Burning a Hindu Widow with the Body of her Late Husband'', from ''Pictorial History of China and India'', 1851]]

Sati refers to a [[funeral]] practice among some communities of [[Indian subcontinent]] in which a recently widowed woman [[Self-immolation|immolates herself]] on her husband's [[funeral pyre]]. The first reliable evidence for the practice of ''sati'' appears from the time of the [[Gupta Empire]] (AD 400),  when instances of sati began to be marked by inscribed memorial stones.&lt;ref name="Shastri"&gt;Shakuntala Rao Shastri, ''Women in the Sacred Laws''—the later law books (1960), also reproduced online at [http://www.hindubooks.org/women_in_the_sacredlaws/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408222221/http://www.hindubooks.org/women_in_the_sacredlaws/ |date=8 April 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one model of history thinking, the practice of ''sati'' only became really widespread with the Muslim invasions of India, and the practice of ''sati'' now acquired a new meaning as a means to preserve the honour of women whose men had been slain. As S.S.Sashi lays out the argument, "The argument is that the practice came into effect during the Islamic invasion of India, to protect their honor from Muslims who were known to commit mass rape on the women of cities that they could capture successfully."&lt;ref&gt;''Sashi'' (1996), p.115&lt;/ref&gt; It is also said that according to the memorial stone evidence, the practice was carried out in appreciable numbers in western and southern parts of India, and even in some areas, before pre-Islamic times.&lt;ref&gt;For Yang's full discussion back and forth, see ''Yang, Sarkar, Sarkar'' (2008), [http://books.google.no/books?id=GEPYbuzOwcQC&amp;pg=PA21 pp.21-23]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the rulers and activist of the time sought actively to suppress the practice of ''sati''.&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;S.M. ''Ikram, Embree'' (1964) [http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/ikram/part2_17.html XVII. "Economic and Social Developments under the Mughals"]  This page maintained by Prof. [[Frances Pritchett]], [[Columbia University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The British began to compile statistics of the incidences of ''sati'' for all their domains from 1815 and onwards. The official statistics for [[Bengal]] represents that the practice was much more common here than elsewhere, recorded numbers typically in the range 500-600 per year, up to the year 1829, when the British authorities banned the practice.&lt;ref&gt;These statistics are further researched and discussed by other scholars, for their reliability (in particular, ''objections'' to that) and representation, see  '''For detailed official statistical information 1815-1829''',''Yang, Sarkar, Sarkar'' (2008), [http://books.google.no/books?id=GEPYbuzOwcQC&amp;pg=PA23 pp.23-25] see pages 24 and 25 in particular, history behind them, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Since 19th - 20th Century, the practice remains outlawed in Indian subcontinent.

[[Jauhar]] was a practice among royal Hindu women to prevent capture by Muslim conquerors.

====Bali and Nepal====
The practice of burning widows has not been restricted to the Indian subcontinent; at [[Bali]], the practice was called ''masatia'' and, apparently, restricted to the burning of royal widows. Although the Dutch colonial authorities had banned the practice, one such occasion is attested as late as in 1903, probably for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;For notice of estimate of last time, see ''Schulte Nordholt'' (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUVlAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211 pp. 211–212, footnote 56]  For estimate of restriction to royal widows, see ''Wiener'' (1995), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GE1uc1UNXNYC&amp;pg=PA267 p. 267]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Nepal]], the practice was not banned until 1920.&lt;ref&gt;''Mittra, Kumar'' (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hYEQGam5hVgC&amp;pg=PA200 p. 200]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditions in sub-Saharan African cultures===
C.H.L. Hahn&lt;ref&gt;Biographical entry of C.H.L. Hahn at [http://www.klausdierks.com/Biographies/Biographies_H.htm BIOGRAPHIES OF NAMIBIAN PERSONALITIES]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that within the O-ndnonga tribe among the [[Ovambo people]] in modern-day [[Namibia]], abortion was not used at all (in contrast to among the other tribes), and that furthermore, if two young unwed individuals had sex resulting in pregnancy, then both the girl and the boy were "taken out to the bush, bound up in bundles of grass and ... burnt alive."&lt;ref&gt;''Hahn'' (1966), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8Z3FQXOiNEC&amp;pg=PA33 p. 33]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation against the practice===
In 1790, Sir Benjamin Hammett introduced a bill into [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to end the practice of judicial burning. He explained that the year before, as [[Sheriff]] of London, he had been responsible for the burning of [[Catherine Murphy (counterfeiter)|Catherine Murphy]], found guilty of [[counterfeit]]ing, but that he had allowed her to be hanged first. He pointed out that as the law stood, he himself could have been found guilty of a crime in not carrying out the lawful punishment and, as no woman had been burnt alive in the kingdom for more than half a century, so could all those still alive who had held an official position at all of the previous burnings. The [[Treason Act 1790]] was duly passed by Parliament and given [[royal assent]] by King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] (30 George III. C. 48).&lt;ref&gt;''Wilson'' (1853), [https://books.google.com/books?id=JdkHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA4 p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern burnings==
===Retaliation against Nazis===
[[Benjamin B. Ferencz]], one of the prosecutors in the [[Nuremberg trials]] who, in May 1945, investigated occurrences at the [[Ebensee concentration camp]], and narrated them to Tom Hofmann, a family member and biographer. He was completely outraged at what the Nazis had done there. When people discovered an SS guard who attempted to flee, they tied him to one of the metal trays used to transport bodies into the crematorium. They then proceeded to light the oven, and slowly roast the SS guard to death, taking him in and out of the oven several times. Ferencz said to Hofmann that at the time, he was in no position to stop the proceedings of the mob, and frankly admitted that he had not been inclined to try. Hofmann adds, "There seemed to be no limit to human brutality in wartime."&lt;ref&gt;''Hofmann'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=JXZzAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 p. 86]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lynching of Germans in Czechoslovakia===

During the [[expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia]] after the end of [[World War II]], a number of massacres against the German minority occurred. In one case in Prague in May 1945, a Czech mob hanged several Germans upside down on lampposts, doused them in fuel and set them on fire, burning them alive.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfried F. Schoeller: [http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/rueckkehr-in-die-verschollene-geschichte.700.de.html?dram:article_id=83403 ''Rückkehr in die verschollene Geschichte''] [[Deutschlandfunk]].de, 16 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gernot Facius: [https://www.welt.de/debatte/kolumnen/Meine-Woche/article6060701/Kleines-Wunder-an-der-Moldau.html ''Kleines Wunder an der Moldau''] [[Die Welt|Welt.de]], 10 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2018}}

===Necklacing===
[[Necklacing]] is the practice of summary execution and torture carried out by forcing a rubber tire, filled with petrol, around a victim's chest and arms, and setting it on fire. The victim may take up to 20 minutes to die, suffering severe burns in the process. The method was widely used in [[Haiti]] and [[South Africa]].

===Extrajudicial burnings in Latin America===

In [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]], [[Necklacing|burning people standing inside a pile of tires]] is a common form of murder used by drug dealers to punish those who have supposedly collaborated with the police. This form of burning is called ''micro-ondas'' (microwave oven).&lt;ref&gt;''Grellet'' (2010) [http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/740136-autorizado-a-visitar-familia-condenado-por-morte-de-tim-lopes-foge-da-prisao.shtml Autorizado a visitar família..]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fenapef.org.br/fenapef/noticia/index/17079|title=Polícia encontra 4 corpos que seriam de traficantes queimados com pneus|language=Portuguese|publisher=Federação Nacional dos Policiais Federais|date=18 September 2008|author=O Globo|accessdate=6 July 2013|location=[[Rio de Janeiro]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925094951/http://www.fenapef.org.br/fenapef/noticia/index/17079|archive-date=25 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/pten/micro-ondas|title=micro-ondas|publisher=WordReference|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[Tropa de Elite]]'' (''Elite Squad'')  and the video game ''[[Max Payne 3]]'' contain scenes depicting this practice.&lt;ref name="A Revista Veja, o PT e as Tendências"&gt;''França'' (2002), [http://veja.abril.com.br/300102/p_094.html Como na Chicago de Capone]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] the Guatemalan Army and security forces carried out an unknown number of extrajudicial killings by burning. In one instance in March 1967, Guatemalan guerrilla and poet [[Otto René Castillo]] was captured by Guatemalan government forces and taken to [[Zacapa]] army barracks alongside one of his comrades, Nora Paíz Cárcamo. The two were interrogated, tortured for four days, and burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Paige'' (1983), pp. 699–737&lt;/ref&gt; Other reported instances of immolation by Guatemalan government forces occurred in the Guatemalan government's rural counterinsurgency operations in the Guatemalan Altiplano in the 1980s. In April 1982, 13 members of a Quanjobal Pentecostal congregation in Xalbal, [[Ixcan]], were burnt alive in their church by the Guatemalan Army.&lt;ref&gt;''Garrard-Burnett'' (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BXWwm7jo-hEC&amp;pg=PA141 p. 141]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 1996, a Mexican man, Rodolfo Soler Hernandez, was burned to death in [[Playa Vicente|Playa Vicente, Mexico]], after he was accused of raping and strangling a local woman to death. Local residents tied Hernandez to a tree, doused him in a flammable liquid and then set him ablaze. His death was also filmed by residents of the village. Shots taken before the killing showed that he had been badly beaten. On 5 September 1996, Mexican television stations broadcast footage of the murder. Locals carried out the killing because they were fed up with crime and believed that the police and courts were both incompetent. Footage was also shown in the 1998 [[shockumentary]] film, ''[[Banned from Television]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A young Guatemalan woman, Alejandra María Torres, was attacked by a mob in [[Guatemala City]] on 15 December 2009. The mob alleged that Torres had attempted to rob passengers on a bus. Torres was beaten, doused with gasoline, and set on fire, but was able to put the fire out before sustaining life-threatening burns. Police intervened and arrested Torres. Torres was forced to go topless throughout the ordeal and subsequent arrest, and many photographs were taken and published. Approximately 219 people were lynched in Guatemala in 2009, of whom 45 died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Lynchings and mass killings by burning in the US===

During the 1980 [[New Mexico State Penitentiary riot]], a number of inmates were burnt to death by fellow inmates, who used [[blow torch]]es. Modern burnings continued as a method of [[lynching in the United States]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the [[Southern United States|South]]. One of the most notorious extrajudicial burnings in modern history occurred in [[Waco, Texas]] on 15 May 1916. [[Jesse Washington lynching|Jesse Washington]], an African-American [[farmhand]], after having been convicted of the rape and subsequent murder of a white woman, was taken by a mob to a bonfire, castrated, doused in [[coal oil]], and hanged by the neck from a chain over the bonfire, slowly burning to death. A postcard from the event still exists, showing a crowd standing next to Washington's charred corpse with the words on the back "This is the barbecue we had last night. My picture is to the left with a cross over it. Your son, Joe". This attracted international condemnation and is remembered as the "[[Waco Horror]]".&lt;ref&gt;''DuBois'' (1916), [http://dl.lib.brown.edu/pdfs/1292363091648500.pdf pp. 1–8] ([https://www.webcitation.org/6FXqUzw4u?url=http://dl.lib.brown.edu/pdfs/1292363091648500.pdf Archive])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wade Goodwyn|Goodwyn, Wade]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31218">[[File:EdgarAllanPoeGrave.jpg|thumb|Poe's body lies beneath this monument in Baltimore. The death of the author is surrounded in mystery.]]
The '''death of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]''' on October 7, 1849, has remained mysterious, the circumstances leading up to it are uncertain and the cause of death is disputed. On October 3, the American author was found delirious in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], "in great distress, and ... in need of immediate assistance", according to the man who found him, Joseph W. Walker.&lt;ref name="Bandy26-27"&gt;Bandy, 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken to the [[Church Home and Hospital|Washington College Hospital]], where he died at 5 a.m. on Sunday, October 7. He was 40 years old. Poe was never coherent enough to explain how he came to be in this condition. 

Much of the extant information about the last few days of Poe's life comes from his [[attending physician]], Dr. John Joseph Moran, though his credibility is questionable.&lt;ref name=Krutch4&gt;Krutch, 4&lt;/ref&gt; Poe was buried after a small [[funeral]] at the back of [[Westminster Hall and Burying Ground]], but his remains were moved to a new grave with a larger monument in 1875. The newer monument also marks the burial place of Poe's wife, [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia]], and his mother-in-law, Maria. Theories as to what caused Poe's death include [[suicide]], [[murder]], [[cholera]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[rabies]], [[syphilis]], [[influenza]], and that Poe was a victim of [[cooping]]. Evidence of the influence of alcohol is strongly disputed.&lt;ref name ="Poe and alcohol"&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Poulter|url=http://www.usna.edu/EnglishDept/poeperplex/alcoholp.htm|title=Edgar Allan Poe and Alcohol|accessdate=July 21, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070602185101/http://www.usna.edu/EnglishDept/poeperplex/alcoholp.htm |archivedate = June 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Poe's death, [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]] wrote his [[obituary]] under the pseudonym "Ludwig". Griswold, who became the [[literary executor]] of Poe's estate, was actually a rival of Poe and later published his first full biography, depicting him as a depraved, drunk, drug-addled madman. Much of the evidence for this image of Poe is believed to have been forged by Griswold, and though friends of Poe denounced it,&lt;ref name=Sova101&gt;Sova, 101&lt;/ref&gt; this interpretation had lasting impact.

== Chronology ==
[[File:Edgar Allan Poe by Pratt, 1849.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Poe by [[William Abbot Pratt]] from September 1849, a month before his death]]
{{PoeTopics}}
On September 27, 1849, Edgar Allan Poe left [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]], on his way [[Edgar Allan Poe Cottage|home]] to [[New York City]]. No reliable evidence exists about Poe's whereabouts until a week later on October 3, when he was found [[delirium|delirious]] in [[Baltimore]] at Ryan's Tavern (sometimes referred to as Gunner's Hall).&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 433&lt;/ref&gt; A printer named Joseph W. Walker sent a letter requesting help from an acquaintance of Poe, Dr. Joseph E. Snodgrass.&lt;ref name="Bandy26-27"/&gt; His letter reads as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Sir—There is a gentleman, rather the worse for wear, at Ryan's 4th ward polls, who goes under the [[wikt:cognomen|cognomen]] of Edgar A. Poe, and who appears in great distress, &amp; he says he is acquainted with you, and I assure you, he is in need of immediate assistance. Yours, in haste, Jos. W. Walker&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 638&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Snodgrass later claimed the note said that Poe was "in a state of beastly [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]]."&lt;ref name="Bandy26-27"/&gt;

Snodgrass's first-hand account describes Poe's appearance as "repulsive", with unkempt hair, a haggard, unwashed face and "lusterless and vacant" eyes. His clothing, Snodgrass said, which included a dirty shirt but no vest and unpolished shoes, was worn and did not fit well.&lt;ref name="Poe's Wandering Trunk"&gt;Jeffrey A. Savoye. "[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc2000/js200402.htm Two Biographical Digressions: Poe's Wandering Trunk and Dr. Carter's Mysterious Sword Cane]", ''Edgar Allan Poe Review'', Fall 2004, 5:15–42. Retrieved on July 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. John Joseph Moran, who was Poe's [[attending physician]], gives his own detailed account of Poe's appearance that day: "a stained faded, old [[bombazine]] coat, pantaloons of a similar character, a pair of worn-out shoes run down at the heels, and an old straw hat". Poe was never coherent long enough to explain how he came to be in this condition, and it is believed the clothes he was wearing were not his own,&lt;ref name="Poe's Wandering Trunk"/&gt; not least because wearing shabby clothes was out of character for Poe.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Moran cared for Poe at the for-profit [[Church Home and Hospital|Washington College Hospital]] on Broadway and Fayette Street.&lt;ref&gt;Washington College Hospital, also known as "Washington University of Baltimore", closed in 1851. The hospital reopened as ''Church Home'' in 1854, and was subsequently renamed ''Church Home and Infirmary'', ''Church Home and Hospital'', ''Church Home Hospital'', and finally ''Church Hospital''. In 1999 Church Hospital closed, and nearby [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] purchased the property. Church Hospital's main building, which includes the original hospital building where Poe died, was subsequently renamed the ''Church Home Building''. Many Baltimore natives refer to the location where Poe died as "Church Home Hospital".&lt;/ref&gt; He was denied any visitors and was confined in a prison-like room with barred windows in a section of the building reserved for drunk people.&lt;ref name=Meyers254&gt;Meyers, 254&lt;/ref&gt; 

Poe is said to have repeatedly called out the name "Reynolds" on the night before his death, though no one has ever been able to identify the person to whom he referred. One possibility is that he was recalling an encounter with [[Jeremiah N. Reynolds]], a newspaper editor and explorer who may have inspired the novel ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Almy, Robert F. [http://posner.library.cmu.edu/Posner/books/pages.cgi?call=808_C71C_N.S._VOL._2_NO._2&amp;layout=vol0/part0/copy0&amp;file=0076 J.N. Reynolds: A Brief Biography With Particular Reference to Poe and Symmes], The Colophon, '''2''' (2), Posner Memorial Collection&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is Henry R. Reynolds, one of the judges overseeing the Fourth Ward Polls at Ryan's Tavern, who may have met Poe on [[Election Day]].&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, 122&lt;/ref&gt; Poe may have instead been calling for "Herring", as the author had an uncle-in-law in Baltimore named Henry Herring. In later testimonies, Moran avoided reference to Reynolds but mentioned a visit by a "Misses Herring".&lt;ref&gt;Bandy, 29–34&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed he attempted to cheer up Poe during one of the few times he was awake. When Moran told his patient that he would soon be enjoying the company of friends, Poe allegedly replied that, "The best thing his friend could do would be to blow out his brains with a pistol".&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 435&lt;/ref&gt;

In Poe's distressed state, he made reference to a wife in Richmond. He may have been delusional, thinking that his wife, [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe]], was still alive, or he may have been referring to [[Sarah Elmira Royster]], to whom he had recently proposed. He did not know what had happened to his trunk of belongings which, it transpired, had been left behind at the Swan Tavern in Richmond.&lt;ref name=Meyers254/&gt; Moran reported that Poe's final words were, "Lord, help my poor soul" before dying on October 7, 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 255&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Credibility of Moran ===
Because Poe did not have visitors, Moran was probably the only person to see the author in his last days. Even so, his credibility has been questioned repeatedly, if not considered altogether untrustworthy.&lt;ref name=Krutch4/&gt; Throughout the years after Poe's death, his story changed as he wrote and lectured on the topic. He claimed (in 1875 and again in 1885, for example) that he had immediately contacted Poe's aunt and mother-in-law, Maria Clemm, to let her know about Poe's death; in fact, he wrote to her only after she had requested it on November 9, almost a full month after the event. He also claimed that Poe had said, quite poetically, as he prepared to draw his last breath: "The arched heavens encompass me, and God has his decree legibly written upon the frontlets of every created human being, and demons incarnate, their goal will be the seething waves of blank despair." The editor of the ''[[New York Herald]]'', which published this version of Moran's story, admitted, "We cannot imagine Poe, even if delirious, constructing [such sentences]."&lt;ref name= "Moran Reynolds"&gt;Bandy, 29&lt;/ref&gt; Poe biographer William Bittner attributes Moran's claim to a convention of assigning pious last words to console mourners.&lt;ref&gt;Bittner, William. ''Poe: A Biography''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1962: 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moran's accounts even altered dates. At different points, he claimed Poe was brought to the hospital on October 3 at 5 p.m., on October 6 at 9 a.m., or on October 7 (the day he died) at "10 o'clock in the afternoon". For each published account, he claimed to have the hospital records as reference.&lt;ref name="Moranp28"&gt;Bandy, 28&lt;/ref&gt; A search for hospital records a century later, specifically an official [[death certificate]], found nothing.&lt;ref name=Bramsback40&gt;Bramsback, Birgit. "The Final Illness and Death of Edgar Allan Poe: An Attempt at Reassessment", ''Studia Neophilologica''. University of Uppsala, XLII, 1970: 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics claim Moran's inconsistencies and errors were due only to a lapse of memory, an innocent desire to romanticize, or even to [[dementia|senility]]. At the time he wrote and published his last account in 1885, Moran was 65.&lt;ref name="Moranp28"/&gt;

== Cause of death ==
[[File:Edgar allan poes grave.jpg|thumb|Poe was originally buried at the back of [[Westminster Hall and Burying Ground]] without a headstone. This stone marks the original burial plot today (Lat: 39.28972; Long: -76.62333).]]
All medical records and documents, including Poe's death certificate, have been lost, if they ever existed.&lt;ref name=Bramsback40/&gt; The precise cause of Poe's death is disputed, but many theories exist. Many biographers have addressed the issue and reached different conclusions, ranging from Jeffrey Meyers' assertion that it was [[hypoglycemia]] to [[John Evangelist Walsh]]'s conspiratorial [[murder]] plot theory.&lt;ref&gt;See Meyers' ''Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy'' and John Evangelist Walsh's ''Midnight Dreary: The Mysterious Death of Edgar Allan Poe''.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that Poe's death might have resulted from [[suicide]] related to [[Clinical depression|depression]]. In 1848, he nearly died from an overdose of [[laudanum]], readily available as a [[sedative|tranquilizer]] and [[analgesic|pain killer]]. Though it is unclear if this was a true suicide attempt or just a miscalculation on Poe's part, it did not lead to Poe's death a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 373–374&lt;/ref&gt;

Snodgrass was convinced that Poe died from [[alcoholism]] and did a great deal to popularize this idea. He was a supporter of the [[temperance movement]] and found Poe a useful example in his temperance work. However, Snodgrass's writings on the topic have been proven untrustworthy.&lt;ref name =Krutch4/&gt; Moran contradicted Snodgrass by stating in his own 1885 account that Poe did not die under the effect of any intoxicant. Moran claimed that Poe "had not the slightest odor of liquor upon his breath or person".&lt;ref name=Krutch4/&gt; Even so, some newspapers at the time reported Poe's death as "congestion of the brain" or "cerebral inflammation", [[euphemism]]s for deaths from disgraceful causes such as alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 435–436&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of Poe, a psychologist suggested that Poe had [[dipsomania]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, John W. ''Edgar A. Poe: A Psychopathic Study''. Haskell House Publishers. New York. 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poe's characterization as an uncontrollable alcoholic is disputed.&lt;ref name ="Poe and alcohol"/&gt; His drinking companion for a time, [[Thomas Mayne Reid]], admitted that the two engaged in wild "frolics" but that Poe "never went beyond the innocent mirth in which we all indulge... While acknowledging this as one of Poe's failings, I can speak truly of its not being habitual".&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 142&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe Poe had a severe susceptibility to alcohol and became drunk after one glass of wine.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 87&lt;/ref&gt; He only drank during difficult periods of his life and sometimes went several months at a time without alcohol.&lt;ref name ="Poe and alcohol"/&gt; Adding further confusion about the frequency of Poe's use of alcohol was his membership in the [[Sons of Temperance]] at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Sova, 269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, David F. "Poe's Art of Transformation: 'The Cask of Amontillado' in Its Cultural Context", as collected in ''The American Novel: New Essays on Poe's Major Tales'', Kenneth Silverman, ed. Cambridge University Press, 1993: 96–97. {{ISBN|0-521-42243-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; William Glenn, who administered Poe's pledge, wrote years later that the temperance community had no reason to believe Poe had violated his pledge while in Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, 147&lt;/ref&gt; Suggestions of a [[drug overdose]] have also been proven to be untrue, though it is still often reported. [[Thomas Dunn English]], an admitted enemy of Poe and a trained doctor, insisted that Poe was not a drug user.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 481&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "Had Poe the [[opium]] habit when I knew him (before 1846) I should both as a physician and a man of observation, have discovered it during his frequent visits to my rooms, my visits at his house, and our meetings elsewhere – I saw no signs of it and believe the charge to be a baseless slander."&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 351&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous other causes of death have been proposed over the years, including several forms of rare [[brain disease]] or a [[brain tumor]], [[diabetes]], various types of [[enzyme deficiency]], [[syphilis]],&lt;ref name="The Crime Library"&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/edgar_allan_poe/6.html The Crime Library: The Murder of Edgar Allan Poe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209135707/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/edgar_allan_poe/6.html |date=2007-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[apoplexy]], [[delirium tremens]], [[epilepsy]] and [[meningitis|meningeal inflammation]].&lt;ref name=Meyers256&gt;Meyers, 256&lt;/ref&gt; A doctor named John W.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe had passed through Philadelphia in early 1849 during a cholera epidemic. He got sick during his time in the city and wrote a letter to his aunt, Maria Clemm, saying that he may "have had the cholera, or spasms quite as bad".&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 414–415&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Poe was found on the day of an election, it was suggested as early as 1872&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; that he was the victim of [[cooping]].&lt;ref name=Lewis1966&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=H.

== Funeral ==
Poe's funeral was a simple one, held at 4 p.m. on Monday, October 8, 1849.&lt;ref name=Meyers256/&gt; Few people attended the ceremony. Poe's uncle, Henry Herring, provided a simple mahogany coffin, and a cousin, [[Neilson Poe]], supplied the hearse.&lt;ref name=Silverman436437&gt;Silverman, 436–437&lt;/ref&gt; Moran's wife made his shroud.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, 1510&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral was presided over by the Reverend W. T. D. Clemm, cousin of Poe's wife Virginia. Also in attendance were Snodgrass, Baltimore lawyer and former [[University of Virginia]] classmate [[Zaccheus Collins Lee]], Poe's first cousin Elizabeth Herring and her husband, and former schoolmaster Joseph Clarke. The entire ceremony lasted only three minutes in the cold, damp weather.&lt;ref name=Silverman436437/&gt; Reverend Clemm decided not to bother with a sermon because the crowd was too small.&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Pearl|Pearl, Matthew]].

May 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexton (office)|Sexton]] George W. Spence wrote of the weather: "It was a dark and gloomy day, not raining but just kind of raw and threatening."&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, 1510–1511&lt;/ref&gt; Poe was buried in a cheap coffin that lacked handles, a nameplate, cloth lining, or a cushion for his head.&lt;ref name=Meyers256/&gt;

On October 10, 2009, Poe received a second funeral in Baltimore. Actors portrayed Poe's contemporaries and other long-dead writers and artists. Each paid their respects and read [[eulogy|eulogies]] adapted from their writings about Poe. The funeral included a replica of Poe's casket and wax [[cadaver]].

[[File:Poe Grave at Westminster 1.jpg|thumb|right|On November 17, 1875, Poe was reburied with a new monument. The remains of his wife, Virginia, and mother-in-law, Maria, are also interred there.]]
Poe is buried on the grounds of [[Westminster Hall and Burying Ground]], now part of the [[University of Maryland School of Law]] in Baltimore. Even after his death, he created controversy and mystery.

Poe was originally buried without a headstone towards the rear corner of the churchyard near his grandfather, David Poe, Sr.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, 1511&lt;/ref&gt; A headstone of white Italian marble, paid for by Neilson Poe, was destroyed before it reached the grave when a train derailed and plowed through the monument yard where it was being kept.&lt;ref name=Meyers256/&gt; Instead, it was marked with a sand-stone block that read "No. 80".&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, 1512&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, Southern poet [[Paul Hamilton Hayne]] visited Poe's grave and published a newspaper article describing its poor condition and suggesting a more appropriate monument. Sara Sigourney Rice, a Baltimore schoolteacher, took advantage of renewed interest in Poe's grave site and personally solicited for funds. She even had some of her [[elocution]] students give public performances to raise money. Many in Baltimore and throughout the U.S. contributed; the final $650 came from Philadelphia publisher and [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[George William Childs]]. The new monument was designed by architect George A. Frederick and built by Colonel Hugh Sisson, and included a medallion of Poe by artist Adalbert Volck. All three men were from Baltimore. The total cost of the monument, with the medallion, amounted to slightly more than $1,500.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; ($31,600 in 2014 dollars) 

Poe was reburied on October 1, 1875, at a new location close to the front of the church. A celebration was held at the dedication of the new tomb on November 17.&lt;ref name=Parker/&gt; His original burial spot was marked with a large stone donated by Orin C. Painter, though it was originally placed in the wrong spot.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, 1514&lt;/ref&gt; Attendees included Neilson Poe, who gave a speech and called his cousin "one of the best hearted men that ever lived", as well as Snodgrass, [[Nathan C. Brooks]] and [[John Hill Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, 1517–1518&lt;/ref&gt; Though several leading poets were invited to the ceremony, [[Walt Whitman]] was the only one to attend.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, David S. ''Walt Whitman's America: A Cultural Biography''. New York: Vintage Books, 1995: 518. {{ISBN|0-679-76709-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] contributed a poem which was read at the ceremony:
&lt;poem&gt;
:Fate that once denied him,
:And envy that once decried him,
:And malice that belied him,
:Now [[cenotaph]] his fame.&lt;ref name=Phillips1517&gt;Phillips, 1517&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

Probably unknown to the reburial crew, the headstones on all the graves, previously facing to the east, had been turned to face the West Gate in 1864.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite web|author=Jamie Parker|url=http://www.nadn.navy.mil/EnglishDept/poeperplex/gravep.htm|title=Who Is Buried in Edgar Poe's Grave?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214130019/http://www.nadn.navy.mil/EnglishDept/poeperplex/gravep.htm|archivedate=2008-02-14|accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew digging up Poe's remains had difficulty finding the right body: they first exhumed a 19-year-old Maryland militiaman, Philip Mosher, Jr.&lt;ref name=Parker/&gt; When they correctly located Poe, they opened his coffin and one witness noted: "The skull was in excellent condition—the shape of the forehead, one of Poe's striking features, was easily discerned."&lt;ref name=Phillips1517/&gt;

A few years later, the remains of Poe's wife, Virginia, were moved to this spot as well. In 1875, the cemetery in which she lay was destroyed, and she had no kin to claim her remains. William Gill, an early Poe biographer, gathered her bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed.&lt;ref name="Meyers, 263"&gt;Meyers, 263&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885, the 76th anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly ten years after his present monument was erected. Spence, the man who served as sexton during Poe's original burial as well as his exhumation and reburial, attended the rites that brought his body to rest with Virginia and her mother, Maria Clemm.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 47&lt;/ref&gt;

== Posthumous character assassination ==
[[File:Griswold-Engraving.jpg|thumb|left|Rufus Wilmot Griswold, Poe's literary executor, wrote the most famous obituary of Poe as well as his first full biography.]]
{{Wikisource|Death of Edgar Allan Poe|Poe's obituary by Rufus Griswold}}
On October 9, the day of Poe's burial, an obituary appeared in the ''[[New York Tribune]]''. Signed only "Ludwig", the obituary floridly alternated between praising the dead author's abilities and eloquence and damning his temperament and ambition. "Ludwig" said that "literary art lost one of its most brilliant, but erratic stars" but also claimed Poe was known for walking the streets in delirium, muttering to himself and that he was excessively arrogant, assumed all men were villains, and was quick to anger. "Ludwig" was later revealed to be [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]], a former colleague and acquaintance of Poe. Even while Poe was still alive, Griswold had engaged in [[character assassination]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Frederick and Anthony Magistrale. ''The Poe Encyclopedia''. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1991: 149. {{ISBN|0-313-27768-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moss, 126&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his characterization in the obituary was lifted almost verbatim from that of the fictitious Francis Vivian in ''[[The Caxtons]]'' by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Edward Bulwer-Lytton]].&lt;ref&gt;Moss, 125&lt;/ref&gt; The obituary quickly became the standard characterization of Poe.&lt;ref&gt;Sova, 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Griswold also claimed that Poe had asked him to be his [[literary executor]]. He had served as an agent for several American authors, but it is unclear whether Poe appointed him to be the executor or whether Griswold became executor through a trick or a mistake by Poe's aunt and mother-in-law, Maria.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 439&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850 he presented, in collaboration with [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]], a collection of Poe's work that included a biographical article titled "Memoir of the Author", in which Poe was depicted as a depraved, drunk, drug-addled madman. Many parts of it were believed to have been fabricated by Griswold, and it was denounced by those who had known Poe, including [[Sarah Helen Whitman]], [[Charles Frederick Briggs]], and [[George Rex Graham]].&lt;ref name=Sova101/&gt; This account became popularly accepted, in part because it was the only full biography available and was widely reprinted. It also remained popular because many readers assumed that Poe was similar to his fictional characters&lt;ref&gt;Gargano, James W. "The Question of Poe's Narrators", collected in ''Poe: A Collection of Critical Essays'', edited by Robert Regan. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1967: 165.&lt;/ref&gt; or were thrilled at the thought of reading the works of an "evil" man.&lt;ref name="Meyers, 263"/&gt;

A more accurate biography of Poe did not appear until [[John Henry Ingram]]'s of 1875. Even so, historians continued to use Griswold's depiction as a model for their own biographies of Poe, including W. H. Davenport in 1880, Thomas R. Slicer in 1909, and [[Augustus Hopkins Strong]] in 1916. Many used Poe as a cautionary tale against alcohol and drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Edgar Allan Poe: An Illustrated Companion to His Tell-Tale Stories | last=Poe | first=Harry Lee | publisher=Metro Books | location=New York | year=2008 | pages=153 | isbn=978-1-4351-0469-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, Arthur Hobson Quinn presented evidence that Griswold had forged and re-written a number of Poe's letters that were included in his "Memoir of the Author".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe | last=Hoffman | first=Daniel | authorlink=Daniel Hoffman | publisher=Louisiana State University Press | location=Baton Rouge, La. | edition=Paperback | year=1998 | pages=14 | isbn=0-8071-2321-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Griswold's depiction of Poe was entrenched in the mind of the public, both in America and around the world, and this distorted image of the author has become part of the Poe legend despite attempts to dispel it.&lt;ref&gt;Stovall, Floyd.

'''Doomfist''' is a fictional, [[playable character]] in the 2016 video game ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]].'' He is an offensive, [[brawler]]-style character, and uses close-range attacks: a charged punch, uppercut, and slam. Doomfist was released in July 2017 as the title's 25th hero, and the fourth introduced after the game's launch.

''Overwatch''{{'s}} [[Overwatch animated media|announcement video]], in 2014, contained a stray reference to a gauntlet. [[Blizzard Entertainment]] later included the gauntlet in the kit of a full-fledged, playable character. In Doomfist's fictional backstory, the playable character became the third generation to wield the gauntlet, and is presented as a [[villain]] after killing his predecessor and becoming a leader of Talon, the game's nemesis group. The [[Overwatch (digital comic series)|digital comic]] ''Masquerade'' accompanied the character's release.
 
Fans were excited by the character's reveal, and professional players praised the [[Balance (game design)|balance]] of his move set. Other critics considered Doomfist too vulnerable to be viable, and insufficiently exciting to rekindle the interest of old players.

Doomfist is voiced by [[Sahr Ngaujah]].

== Description ==

Doomfist is an offense character built as a [[brawler]], with close-range, melee attacks from his [[cybernetic]]&lt;!-- {{r|Kotaku: early thoughts}}, if needed --&gt; [[gauntlet (glove)|gauntlet]]. His Rocket Punch is a charged attack that launches Doomfist in the direction of the player's aim. It does extra damage if it pummels the enemy into a wall.{{r|HND: kit}} It is useful for finishing enemies in retreat as well as pushing enemies off edges.{{r|PC Gamer: pros analyze}} The Rising Uppercut punches the enemy with Doomfist into the air, and the Seismic Slam performs a smashing dive to return to the ground. His only non-melee attack is his short-range Hand Cannon, which shoots a shotgun burst of projectiles from the gauntlet's knuckles.{{r|HND: kit}} Its four shots of ammunition regenerate slowly.{{r|HND: kit|PC Gamer: pros analyze}} Doomfist's passive ability regenerates his shields when he deals damage.

For instance, the player can Seismic Slam an opponent, which pulls in enemies, and progress into a Rising Uppercut, which tosses the opponent into the air. During that toss, the player can charge the Rocket Punch and release as the opponent returns to the ground. Alternatively, the player can launch into the air, pick an opponent to slam, and punch them at close range. The character is built for aggressive playstyles and advanced players&lt;!-- "high skill cap" --&gt;.{{r|PC Gamer: pros analyze}}

Among his advantages, his move combinations contribute to his high mobility, compared to other ''Overwatch'' playable characters. Doomfist can easily reach and neutralize enemies occupying high ground, such as snipers. He is most effective against low-mobility opponents, but susceptible to high-mobility opponents, such as [[Pharah (Overwatch)|Pharah]], [[Soldier: 76]], and [[Sombra (Overwatch)|Sombra]]. Among his disadvantages, Doomfist is dependent on his abilities to escape groups of enemies, leaving the player helpless when his abilities are unavailable (on cooldown or hacked by Sombra). Doomfist's large "hitbox", or area for taking damage, disadvantages him to characters such as [[Reaper (Overwatch)|Reaper]], [[Roadhog (Overwatch)|Roadhog]], and [[Ana (Overwatch)|Ana]]'s sleep dart.{{r|PC Gamer: pros analyze}}

Some of the character's skins relate to his fictional cultural heritage, such as the [[orisha]] gods of the [[Yoruba religion]] and the [[Traditional African masks|African ceremonial mask tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Frank |first1=Allegra |title=Overwatch is embracing Doomfist's Nigerian origins in the coolest way |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=2017-07-13 |url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/7/13/15965716/overwatch-doomfist-legendary-skins-nigerian |accessdate=2017-07-13 |df=mdy-all |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713205017/https://www.polygon.com/2017/7/13/15965716/overwatch-doomfist-legendary-skins-nigerian |archivedate=July 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Kim |first1=Matt |title=Doomfist's First Legendary Skins are Live on the Overwatch PTR |work=[[USgamer]] |date=2017-07-13 |url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/doomfists-first-legendary-skins-are-live-on-the-overwatch-ptr |accessdate=2017-07-13 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doomfist's other aesthetic customization options allude to the boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], the [[Combo (video gaming)|combo sequences]] of [[fighting video game]]s, and other pop culture references.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Frank |first1=Allegra |title=Doomfist's sprays make 'the greatest' references |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=2017-07-13 |url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/7/13/15959886/overwatch-doomfist-sprays |accessdate=2017-07-13 |df=mdy-all |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714034404/https://www.polygon.com/2017/7/13/15959886/overwatch-doomfist-sprays |archivedate=July 14, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|HND: sprays}}

== Development ==

{{external media |video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXCNNDHboho The 2014 cinematic], in which the game was first announced and Doomfist's gauntlet first appeared |video2=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBaWAxeHcw0 Doomfist character preview with developer commentary]}}

Doomfist was a stray reference in ''Overwatch''{{'}}s original [[Overwatch animated media|animated short]] whose obsessive popularity with fans led the development team to expand his lore with in-game references in the game's Numbani map.{{r|IGN: official teaser|IGN: mock audition}} In the cinematic video used to announce the game in 2014, a boy is excited to see Doomfist's gauntlet on display behind glass at the Overwatch museum.{{r|HND: ever}} Doomfist's gauntlet was a plot device, and the developers had not planned to create a character to wield it. ''Overwatch'' Creative Director [[Chris Metzen]] played with compound nouns to give the gauntlet a name reminiscent of a shotgun. The developers expanded the gauntlet into a Doomfist character in bits. In particular, they decided to use the gauntlet as the centerpiece for the game's Numbani environment, in which the gauntlet is encased in the map's objective, the payload, to be delivered to a Doomfist exhibit at a museum. By late 2015, the team decided Doomfist would be a generational hero, like that of superhero universes, were he to be a full-fledged playable character,{{r|PC Gamer: as it goes}} the fourth additional character to be added to game,{{r|Engadget: fourth}} and 25th on the roster.{{r|Polygon: finally}}

In designing the character, Blizzard's Geoff Goodman said they crafted Doomfist as an "ode to the [[fighting game|fighting genre]]", both in his skill kit and in concept art.{{r|GS: SDCC}} Though Blizzard tried to keep all of his attacks as melee, they found, as they had with Genji, that Doomfist needed some type of ranged attack to make him playable; an early attack had been a phantom punch that would have been launched from his fist.{{r|GS: SDCC 2}} Doomfist had also be considered as a Tank class, but Blizzard did not want to make the mistake again of having a high-health character with powerful attacks as they had initially with Roadhog at the game's introduction.{{r|GS: SDCC 2}} At one point during development, Doomfist would have been able to pick up enemies and use them as [[human shield]]s or to throw them, but Blizzard dropped this as he was not supposed to be a wrestler or [[luchador]], according to Goodman.{{r|GS: SDCC 2}} They also dropped an ability for him to grab pieces of the ground and throw them.{{r|GS: SDCC 2}} His ultimate ability was originally designed for [[Orisa (Overwatch)|Orisa]], the character introduced prior to Doomfist.{{r|GS: SDCC 2}}

[[File:Sahr Ngaujah Last Resort NYC 2012 Copyright Rameen Gasery.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Doomfist voice actor [[Sahr Ngaujah]], pictured in 2012]]

Actor and former [[American football]] player [[Terry Crews]] generated support on social media in his bid to [[video game voice actor|voice the character]], which included a mock audition, a visit to the developer's headquarters, an endorsement from fellow actor [[Dwayne Johnson]], and a fan campaign.{{r|Polygon: heartbreak|Kotaku: excited|GamesRadar: YES, PLEASE GOD YES}} The character was ultimately voiced by [[Sahr Ngaujah]], who previously appeared in ''[[Money Monster]]'' and ''[[Stomp the Yard]]''.{{r|IGN: in PTR}} Blizzard's Michael Chu explained that when they were casting for Doomfist specifically looking for "something very specific given his role in the game", Ngaujah's audition significantly impressed them, along with his ability to deliver many different "flavors" that they needed for the character.{{r|GS: SDCC}} Crews ultimately felt that Ngaujah was a better fit for Doomfist, and was pleased to have been included, instead, in [[Microsoft]]'s ''[[Crackdown 3]]''.{{r|PC Gamer: Crews Crackdown}} Chu did not rule out using Crews elsewhere within ''Overwatch''.{{r|GS: SDCC}}

In the lead-up to Blizzard's official announcement of the playable character, the developers teased his release by modifying the Doomfist gauntlet in Numbani to appear to be stolen from its glass case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Skrebels |first1=Joe |title=More Evidence of New Hero Doomfist Emerges in Latest Overwatch Update |work=[[IGN]] |date=2017-02-08 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/08/more-evidence-of-new-hero-doomfist-emerges-in-latest-overwatch-update |accessdate=2017-07-10 |df=mdy-all |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318115538/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/08/more-evidence-of-new-hero-doomfist-emerges-in-latest-overwatch-update |archivedate=March 18, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Kotaku: excited}} Blizzard finally confirmed the Doomfist's development with a [[teaser trailer]] in early July 2017, a week after news of the release leaked through the game's [[crash log]]s.{{r|IGN: official teaser}} The reveal cinematic was drawn in an anime-style by Wolf Smoke Studio, based in Shanghai, who had previously expressed and rallied interest in developing an anime in the game's fictional universe.{{r|Polygon: Wolf Smoke}} Blizzard also sent an official Doomfist [[cosplayer]] to the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] and [[Overwatch World Cup 2017|Overwatch World Cup Sydney qualifier]].{{r|Polygon: cosplay|Kotaku: cosplay}} Soon after the reveal, Doomfist became playable on the game's test servers,{{r|IGN: in PTR}} where some of the character's powers were rebalanced to reduce punch distance and vertical mobility.{{r|HND: launch nerf}} The character was released for all platforms on July 27, 2017.{{r|GS: live}}

== Lore ==

{{external media |video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaZfZFNuOpI Doomfist origin story], an official, animated short}}

Doomfist is presented as a "generational" character who, like [[The Green Lantern]] or [[The Flash]], has passed through two generational eras in which he was known to the fictional world as "The Savior" and "The Scourge".{{r|IGN: mock audition}} The playable Doomfist is the character's third incarnation, labeled "The Successor" as the third person to be called "Doomfist".{{r|IGN: real villain}}

Doomfist is one of the villains of the ''Overwatch'' fictional universe.{{r|IGN: real villain}} In the backstory of the third Doomfist, Akande Ogundimu is presented as the villainous heir to a [[prosthetics]] company in Nigeria who splits his time between expanding the company and [[martial arts]] training. During the game's "Omnic War" between humans and rogue Omnic robots, Ogundimu lost his right arm. His prosthetic replacement impressed the second Doomfist (Akinjide Adeyemi), who then trained Ogundimu as his successor, but the student later killed his teacher to claim the gauntlet for himself. Ogundimu became a leader&lt;!-- along with Reaper, Sombra, Widowmaker --&gt; of the Talon group, the nemesis organization to Overwatch, and advocates for his belief that forces of conflict will strengthen humanity. At some point prior to the game's present, Overwatch's [[Winston (Overwatch)|Winston]], a playable character from the game, defeats Doomfist and puts the titular gauntlet behind glass in the Overwatch museum, as referenced in the original ''Overwatch'' announcement video.{{r|HND: ever}} Blizzard's first teaser for Doomfist's release shows a fictional news report about Talon freeing Doomfist from prison to steal the gauntlet.{{r|IGN: in PTR|Polygon: finally}} Blizzard had modified the Numbani level during its release of Orisa, the previous playable character released for the game, to imply that Doomfist had attacked the city and stolen the gauntlet; notably, the payload casing had been broken open and the gauntlet missing.{{r|Polygon: something's happening}}

[[Overwatch (digital comic series)|A digital comic]] accompanied the playable character's release, featuring Doomfist in a [[James Bond]]-esque casino setting. ''Masquerade'' establishes the character's motivations and competition following his release from prison.{{r|HND: Masquerade|HND: Masquerade costumes}}

== Reception ==

Upon Doomfist's official announcement, ''[[Kotaku]]'' reported the fan reaction as "beyond excited".{{r|Kotaku: react}} Fan anticipation for the character rivaled that for [[Sombra (Overwatch)|Sombra]], a character released the previous year{{r|IGN: real villain}} with a prolonged reveal period.{{r|PC Gamer: on PTR}} Players had hoped for the release of Doomfist each time Blizzard had revealed an additional character for the game.{{r|Kotaku: react}} ''Polygon'' wrote that Doomfist's announcement cinematic, drawn in an anime style, was the best in the series to date.{{r|Polygon: Wolf Smoke}}&lt;!-- {{r|Kotaku: react}} thought it was "fun", though is that noteworthy --&gt; Fans who had lobbied for Terry Crews to play Doomfist's voice were disappointed to discover his absence, but Sahr Ngaujah's performance was praised at the time of Doomfist's formal unveiling,{{r|Polygon: heartbreak}} and fans received the character positively anyway.{{r|Kotaku: react}} Blizzard's choice of Ngaujah over the higher profile Crews also meant that the voice actor would be more available to reappear for additional recording and other game community events.{{r|HND: famous}} Doomfist also fulfilled ''Overwatch''{{'s}} sore lack of a [[supervillain]], according to ''IGN'', in a cast of other morally ambiguous but tragic and redeemable characters. The critic anticipated Doomfist as the start of Blizzard making Talon into a villainous organization à la [[Legion of Doom]] (''[[Justice League]]'') or [[Masters of Evil]] (''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'').{{r|IGN: real villain}}

''Heroes Never Die'', an ''Overwatch''-specific news spinoff site by ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', wrote that Doomfist's style was wholly unlike that of the other characters, and created a "feast or famine" scenario in which the character is only helpful when engaged in risky, aggressive play.{{r|HND: guide}} The site expected Doomfist's release to affect team character selections to maximize Doomfist's strengths, weaknesses, and synergies.{{r|HND: synergies}} ''PC Gamer'' praised Doomfist's [[Balance (game design)|balance]] against the other characters just prior to his launch. Professional players complimented the addition of a strong, counterable character to disrupt the common, uncounterable characters normally played in the professional circuit. Another commended the idea of fighting game-style combos in a first-person shooter for adding an additional skill ceiling for players to pursue.{{r|PC Gamer: pros analyze}} ''Kotaku'', however, considered Doomfist a better fit for a ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' fighting game than ''Overwatch'', and bemoaned the character's vulnerability to snipers, low health, and lack of escape options, which made him less threatening or even unrewarding.{{r|Kotaku: early thoughts}} Even as Doomfist's design was neat, ''[[Waypoint (website)|Waypoint]]''{{'s}} critic thought, the character was not exciting or enough of an [[extrinsic motivator]] to reclaim players who had dropped out from its player base.{{r|Waypoint: won't}} Other reviewers, however, found simple joy in pulling off punches and combos.{{r|Engadget: review|Kotaku: early thoughts}}

At the time of Doomfist's release, the ''Overwatch'' meta-game was favoring "dive" compositions, using a character that can jump over a great distance like Winston or D.Va. Players using these characters would self-sacrifice themselves by jumping into or behind an enemy front-line, and do as much damage as possible, distracting that team from a major push. About a month after Doomfist's addition, the "dive" strategy had become readily countered as Doomfist can quickly eliminate either the singular threat or the oncoming group particularly when coupled with crowd-control skills like Zarya's or Reinhardt's ultimates.{{r|PC Gamer: Doomfist meta}}

Considered the natural successor to [[Douglas Fairbanks]], he achieved worldwide fame for his romantic [[swashbuckler]] roles in Hollywood films, as well as frequent partnerships with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. He was best-known for his role as [[Robin Hood]] in ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938); his portrayal of the character was named by the [[American Film Institute]] as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains|18th greatest hero in American film history]]. His other famous roles included the eponymous lead in [[Captain Blood (1935 film)|''Captain Blood'']] (1935), Major Geoffrey Vickers in [[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936 film)|''The Charge of the Light Brigade'']] (1936), as well as a number of Westerns, such as [[Dodge City (film)|''Dodge City'']] (1939), [[Santa Fe Trail (film)|''Santa Fe Trail'']] (1940), and [[San Antonio (film)|''San Antonio'']] (1945).

==Early life==
[[File:Enid Lyons and Errol Flynn (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|upright|Errol Flynn at the age of nine, as a page boy in a [[queen carnival]]. On his right is [[Enid Lyons]], who would later become the first woman elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives]].]]
[[File:Errol Flynn at South West London College (1923).jpg|right|thumb|upright|Errol Flynn at South West London College aged 14 (1923)]]
Errol Leslie Flynn was born on 20 June 1909 in [[Battery Point, Tasmania|Battery Point]], a suburb of [[Hobart|Hobart, Tasmania]], Australia. His father, [[Theodore Thomson Flynn]], was a lecturer (1909) and later professor (1911) of biology at the [[University of Tasmania]]. His mother was born Lily Mary Young, but shortly after marrying Theodore at St John's Church of England, [[Balmain, New South Wales|Birchgrove]], Sydney, on 23 January 1909,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080725b.htm|title=Flynn, Errol Leslie (1909–1959)|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography Online|accessdate=7 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; she changed her first name to Marelle.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn always calls her Marelle in his autobiography.&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn described his mother's family as ''"seafaring folk"''&lt;ref name="wicked33"&gt;Flynn, ''My Wicked, Wicked Ways'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and this appears to be where his lifelong interest in boats and the sea originated. Both of his parents were Australian-born of Irish, English, and Scottish descent. Despite Flynn's claims,&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, ''My Wicked, Wicked Ways'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; the evidence indicates that he was not descended from any of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|Bounty mutineers]].&lt;ref name="whosyourgrandaddy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fasano|first=Debra|url=http://www.whosyourgrandaddy.id.au|title=Young Blood – The Making of Errol Flynn|year=2009|isbn=978-0-9806703-0-1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524040258/http://whosyourgrandaddy.id.au/|archivedate=24 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn received his early schooling in Hobart. He made one of his first appearances as a performer in 1918, aged nine, when he served as a page boy to [[Enid Lyons]] in a [[queen carnival]]. In her memoirs, Lyons recalled Flynn as "a dashing figure – a handsome boy of nine with a fearless, somewhat haughty expression, already showing that sang-froid for which he was later to become famous throughout the civilized world". She further noted: "Unfortunately Errol at the age of nine did not yet possess that magic for extracting money from the public which so distinguished his career as an actor. Our cause gained no apparent advantage from his presence in my entourage; we gained only third place in a field of seven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.moadoph.gov.au/blog/oh-errol-what-does-errol-flynn-have-to-do-with-democracy/|title=Oh Errol!—what does Errol Flynn have to do with democracy?|publisher=Museum of Australian Democracy|date=20 June 2013|access-date=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1923 to 1925, Flynn was educated at the South West London College, a private boarding school in [[Barnes, London|Barnes]], London.&lt;ref&gt;Bardrick, Ajax (2008) 'Errol Flynn's Barnes Period', published by 'the-vu' http://www.the-vu.com/2008/10/errol-flynn%E2%80%99s-barnes-period&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, he returned to Australia to attend [[Sydney Church of England Grammar School]] (known as "Shore"),&lt;ref&gt;Moore, John Hammond: "Young Errol Flynn before Hollywood", 1975; {{ISBN|0-207-13158-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was the classmate of a future Australian prime minister, [[John Gorton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shaw|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/22/world/sir-john-gorton-90-australian-who-vetoed-himself-as-premier.html|title=Sir John Gorton, 90, Australian Who Vetoed Himself as Premier|work=The New York Times|date=22 May 2002|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His formal education ended with his expulsion from Shore for theft,&lt;ref name="jhmoore"&gt;Moore, John Hammond 'The Young Errol Flynn Before Hollywood' (2nd Edition, 2011), Trafford Publishing&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; although he later claimed it was for a sexual encounter with the school's laundress.&lt;ref name="Flynn, Errol 1959"/&gt; After being dismissed from a job as a junior clerk with a [[Sydney]] shipping company for pilfering petty cash, he went to [[Papua New Guinea]] at the age of eighteen, seeking his fortune in tobacco planting and metals mining. He spent the next five years oscillating between New Guinea and Sydney.&lt;ref name="jhmoore"/&gt;

In January 1931, Flynn became engaged to Naomi Campbell-Dibbs, the youngest daughter of Mr and Mrs R Campbell-Dibbs of Temora and Bowral NSW. They did not marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16748356|title=Family Notices|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|issue=29,034|location=New South Wales, Australia|date=24 January 1931|page=12|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
===''In the Wake of the Bounty''===
Australian filmmaker [[Charles Chauvel (filmmaker)|Charles Chauvel]] was making a film about the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]], ''[[In the Wake of the Bounty]]'' (1933), a combination of dramatic re-enactments of the mutiny and a documentary on present-day [[Pitcairn Island]]. Chauvel was looking for someone to play the role of [[Fletcher Christian]]. There are different stories how Errol Flynn was cast. According to one, Chauvel saw his picture in an article about a yacht wreck involving Flynn.&lt;ref name="kelly"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128376848|title=It All Began With a Feature Movie On The Kelly Gang.|newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]]|location=Adelaide|date=16 November 1946|accessdate=20 February 2014|page=2|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular account is that he was discovered by cast member [[John Warwick]]. The film was not a strong success at the box office, but it was the lead role and seemed to ignite Flynn's interest in acting. In late 1933 he went to Britain to pursue a career in acting.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Britain===
Flynn got work as an extra in a film, ''[[I Adore You (film)|I Adore You]]'' (1933), produced by [[Irving Asher]] for Warner Bros. Flynn soon secured a job with the [[Northampton]] Repertory Company at the town's Royal Theatre (now part of [[Royal &amp; Derngate]]), where he worked and received his training as a professional actor for seven months. Northampton is home to an art-house cinema named after him, the Errol Flynn Filmhouse.&lt;ref name="northamptonchron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/lifestyle/film/new-art-house-cinema-to-be-named-after-hollywood-legend-errol-flynn-1-4890147|title=New art-house cinema to be named after Hollywood legend Errol Flynn|publisher=northamptonchron.co.uk|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed at the 1934 [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]] Festival and in [[Glasgow]], and briefly in London's West End.&lt;ref name="Connelly"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Connelly, Gerry|title=Errol Flynn in Northampton|year=1998|publisher=Domra Publications|isbn=978-0-9524417-2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 Flynn was dismissed from Northampton Rep. after he threw a female stage manager down a stairwell. He returned to London. Asher cast him as the lead in ''[[Murder at Monte Carlo]]'', a "[[quota quickie]]" made by Warner Brothers at their [[Teddington Studios]] in Middlesex. The movie was not widely seen (it is currently a [[lost film]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/nationalarchive/news/mostwanted/murder-at-monte-carlo.html|title=Murder at Monte Carlo|publisher=BFI|date=23 December 2010|accessdate=18 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314073323/http://www.bfi.org.uk/nationalarchive/news/mostwanted/murder-at-monte-carlo.html|archivedate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but Asher was enthusiastic about Flynn's performance and cabled Warner Bros in Hollywood, recommending him for a contract. Executives agreed, and Flynn was sent out to Los Angeles.

On the ship from London, Flynn met (and eventually married) [[Lili Damita]], an actress five years his senior whose contacts proved valuable when Flynn arrived in Los Angeles. Warner Bros publicity described him as an "Irish leading man of the London stage."&lt;ref&gt;Schallert, Edwin.

His first appearance was a small role in ''[[The Case of the Curious Bride]]'' (1935). Flynn had two scenes, one as a corpse and one in flashback. His next part was slightly bigger, in ''[[Don't Bet on Blondes]]'' (1935), a B-picture [[screwball comedy]].

===''Captain Blood''===
Warner Bros were preparing a big budget swashbuckler, ''[[Captain Blood (1935 film)|Captain Blood]]'' (1935), based on the novel by [[Rafael Sabatini]] and directed by [[Michael Curtiz]]. They originally intended to cast [[Robert Donat]], but he turned down the role. Warners considered a number of other actors, including [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], [[James Cagney]], and also conducted screen tests of those they had under contract, like Flynn. The tests were impressive and Warners finally cast Flynn in the lead, opposite [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The resulting film was a magnificent success for both the studio and Flynn, and a new Hollywood star was born. The budget for Captain Blood was $1.242 million, and it made $1.357 million in the US and $1.733 million overseas, making Warner Bros. a huge profit.&lt;ref name="Glancy"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Glancy | first = H | title = Warner Bros.

Flynn had been selected to support [[Frederic March]] in ''[[Anthony Adverse]]'' (1936), but public response to ''Captain Blood'' was so enthusiastic that Warners instead reunited him with de Havilland and Curtiz in another adventure tale, this time set in British India, ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936 film)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]'' (1936). It was another big hit, having been given a slightly larger budget than ''Captain Blood'', at $1.33 million. The film had a much higher box office gross, with $1.454 million from the US and $1.928 million from overseas, making it Warner Brothers #1 hit of 1936.&lt;ref name="Glancy" /&gt;

For a change of pace, Warners put him in a medical melodrama, ''[[Green Light (1937 film)|Green Light]]'' (1937), playing a crusading doctor, a role originally intended for Leslie Howard. He then made another swashbuckler, replacing [[Patric Knowles]] in what was essentially a supporting role in ''[[The Prince and the Pauper (1937 film)|The Prince and the Pauper]]'' (1937). He appeared opposite [[Kay Francis]] in ''[[Another Dawn (1937 film)|Another Dawn]]'' (1937), a melodrama set in a British colony. Warners then gave Flynn his first starring role in a comedy, ''[[The Perfect Specimen]]'' (1937), with [[Joan Blondell]] under the direction of Curtiz. During this period Flynn published his first book, ''Beam Ends'' (1937), an autobiographical account of his sailing experiences around Australia as a youth. He also travelled to [[Spain]], in 1937, as a war correspondent during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flamingstarfilms.com.au/presskits/Tasmanian_Devil.pdf|format=PDF|title=''Tasmanian Devil: The Fast and Furious Life of Errol Flynn''|website=Flamingstarfilms.com.au|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Adventures of Robin Hood''===
[[File:The Adventures of Robin Hood 1938 Trailer.jpg|thumb|right|With [[Olivia de Havilland]] in ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938).]]
Flynn followed this with his most famous movie, ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938), playing the title role, opposite de Havilland's Maid Marian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2009/05/15/32184-torn-exclusive-with-reclaiming-the-blade-director|title=Exclusive with 'Reclaiming The Blade' Director|publisher=Theonering.net|date=15 May 2009|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movie was a worldwide success. It was the 6th top movie grosser of 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Variety December 1938&lt;/ref&gt; The budget for Robin Hood was the highest ever for a Warner Brothers production up to that point, $2.47 million but it more than made back its costs and turned a huge profit as it grossed $2.343 million in the US and $2.495 overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Glancy warner Bros. ledgers
&lt;/ref&gt;

Warners let him try a screwball comedy as a change of pace, ''[[Four's a Crowd]]'' (1938). Despite the presence of de Havilland and direction of Curtiz, it was not a success. More popular was a melodrama with [[Bette Davis]], ''[[The Sisters (1938 film)|The Sisters]]'' (1938). He had a strong dramatic part in the all-male anti-war film, ''[[The Dawn Patrol (1938 film)|The Dawn Patrol]]'' (1938), alongside [[David Niven]], then made his first Western, ''[[Dodge City (film)|Dodge City]]'' (1939), with Curtiz and de Havilland.

===Second World War===
[[File:Bette Davis - Errol Flynn.jpg|right|thumb|upright|With [[Bette Davis]] in ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'' (1939)]]
Flynn was reunited with Davis, Curtiz, and de Havilland in ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'' (1939), playing [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]]. Flynn's relationship with Davis during filming was quarrelsome; Davis allegedly slapped him across the face far harder than necessary during one scene. Flynn attributed her anger to unrequited romantic interest,&lt;ref name="Flynn, Errol 1959"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flynn|first1=Errol|first2=Earl|last2=Conrad|date=1959|title=[[My Wicked, Wicked Ways]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but according to others, Davis resented sharing equal billing with a man she considered incapable of playing any role beyond a dashing adventurer. "He himself openly said, 'I don't know really anything about acting,'" she told an interviewer, "and I admire his honesty, because he's absolutely right."&lt;ref&gt;Spada, J. ''More Than a Woman: An Intimate Biography of Bette Davis''. Bantam (1993), p. 143; {{ISBN|0553095129}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, however, de Havilland recounted that during a private screening of ''Elizabeth and Essex'', an astounded Davis exclaimed, "Damn it! The man ''could'' act!"&lt;ref&gt;Matzen, R. ''Errol &amp; Olivia: Ego &amp; Obsession in Golden Era Hollywood''. Paladin (2010), pp. 186-87; {{ISBN|097116858X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warners put Flynn in another Western, ''[[Virginia City (film)|Virginia City]]'' (1940), a follow up to ''Dodge City'', which was very popular, making a profit of just under one million dollars. He then made another swashbuckler from a Sabatini novel, ''[[The Sea Hawk (1940 film)|The Sea Hawk]]'' (1940), which had been planned since 1936. It was another hit with a profit of $977,000 on a budget of $1.7 million. So too was the Western, ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|Santa Fe Trail]]'' (1940), with de Havilland, and Ronald Reagan, and directed by Curtiz that grossed $2,147,663 in the US making it Warner Bros. 2nd biggest hit of 1940.

In 1940, at the zenith of his career, Flynn was voted the fourteenth most popular star in the US and the seventh most popular in Britain according to the Motion Picture Daily Herald. According to Variety he was the 4th biggest star in the US and also the 4th biggest Box Office attraction overseas as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47308347|title=FILM WORLD|newspaper=[[The West Australian]]|location=Perth, WA|date=14 February 1941|accessdate=24 April 2012|page=16|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47309649|title=FILM WORLD|newspaper=[[The West Australian]]|location=Perth, WA|date=21 February 1941|accessdate=24 April 2012|page=14|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'', 8 January 1941, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the era when Errol Flynn was one of Warner Brothers' consistently top stars. In 1937 he was Warner Bros. No. 1 star, ahead of [[Paul Muni]] and [[Bette Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'', 5 January 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 he was #3 just behind Bette Davis and Paul Muni.&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'', 5 January 1939&lt;/ref&gt; By 1939 he was No. 3 again, this time behind Bette Davis and James Cagney.&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'', 18 December 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 and 1941 he was again Warner Bros. No. 1 top Box Office draw for both years.&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'', 8 January/31 December 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, he was No. 2 behind [[James Cagney]].&lt;ref&gt;Variety, December 1942&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, he was Warners #2 star, behind [[Humphrey Bogart]].&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'', December 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warners allowed him a change of pace, a screwball comedy, ''[[Footsteps in the Dark (film)|Footsteps in the Dark]]'' (1941), but it was not a success. Far more popular was the military drama, ''[[Dive Bomber (film)|Dive Bomber]]'' (1941); this was his last film with Curtiz.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Flynn started a new long-term relationship with a director when teamed with [[Raoul Walsh]] in ''[[They Died with Their Boots On]]'' (1942), a biopic of [[George Armstrong Custer]]. His co-star was de Havilland in this, the last of twelve movies they made together. The movie was one of the biggest hits of 1942. It grossed $2.55 million in the US alone, making it [[Warner Bros.]] second biggest hit of the year.&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'', January 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn became a [[naturalised]] American citizen on 14 August 1942.&lt;ref name="Basinger, Jeanine p. 247"/&gt; With the United States fully involved in the [[Second World War]], he attempted to enlist in the armed services, but failed the physical exam due to recurrent [[malaria]] (contracted in [[New Guinea]]), a heart murmur, various venereal diseases, and latent pulmonary tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="Basinger, Jeanine p. 247"&gt;Basinger, Jeanine: ''The Star Machine''. Vintage reprint (2009), p. 247; {{ISBN|0307388751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn was mocked by reporters and critics as a "draft dodger," but the studio refused to admit that their star, promoted for his physical beauty and athleticism, had been disqualified due to health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55850501|title=STAR SYSTEM 'ON THE WAY OUT'.|newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]]|location=Adelaide, South Australia|date=14 October 1950|accessdate=4 August 2012|page=8 Supplement: Sunday Magazine|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn's first war film was ''[[Desperate Journey]]'' (1942) directed by Walsh, in which he played an Australian for the first time. It was another big hit. He played [[Gentleman Jim Corbett]] in Walsh's ''[[Gentleman Jim (film)|Gentleman Jim]]'' (1942), a popular boxing movie. During filming Flynn had a heart attack, but he recovered. It was the third Errol Flynn movie to gross at least $2 million for Warner Bros. in 1942, according to ''Variety''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Glancy, H. Mark. "Warner Bros film grosses, 1921-51", ''Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television'' (March 1995).&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hit was ''[[Edge of Darkness (1943 film)|Edge of Darkness]]'' (1943) which had a box office gross of $2.3 million in the US making it Warner Bros. 8th biggest movie of the year and one in which Flynn played a Norwegian resistance fighter for director [[Lewis Milestone]]. He had a cameo in Warners' all-star ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (film)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]'' (1943), singing a song. In September 1942 it was announced that Flynn had signed a new contract with Warners for four films a year, one of which he was to also produce.&lt;ref&gt;"Of Local Origin," ''The New York Times'', 30 September 1942, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rape allegations===
In late 1942, two 17-year-old girls, Betty Hansen&lt;ref&gt;Florabel Muir, 'Cast as a Villain, Errol Plans a New Battle' New York Daily News 18 October 1942 p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; and Peggy Satterlee&lt;ref&gt;'Flynn and Peggy on Yacht' Des Moines Register, 5 November 1942 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;, separately accused Flynn of [[statutory rape]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6929318/page/2|title=Statutory Rape Charges|publisher=MSNBC|date=1 March 2005|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] home of Flynn's friend [[Frederick McEvoy]], and on board Flynn's yacht Sirocco, respectively.&lt;ref name="Advertiser1942"&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48888810?searchTerm=fred%20mcevoy&amp;searchLimits=Flynn's Host Sued For Divorce], ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'', 28 October 1942; retrieved 26 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal received immense press attention. Many of Flynn's fans founded organisations to publicly protest the accusation.  One such group, the American Boys' Club for the Defense of Errol Flynn—ABCDEF—accumulated a substantial membership that included [[William F. Buckley Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;Valenti, Peter. ''Errol Flynn: A Bio-Bibliography'', pg. 141.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial took place in late January and early February 1943. Flynn's attorney, [[Jerry Giesler]], impugned the accusers' character and morals, and accused them of numerous indiscretions, including affairs with married men and, in Satterlee's case, an abortion (which was illegal at the time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/throwback-thursday-errol-flynn-stood-699299|title=Throwback Thursday: Errol Flynn Stood Trial for Statutory Rape in 1934|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=5 January 2014|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that the two girls, who said they did not know each other, filed their complaints within days of each other, although the episodes allegedly took place more than a year apart. He implied that the girls had cooperated with prosecutors in hopes of avoiding prosecution themselves.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jerry Giesler Story''.

===After the trial===
''[[Northern Pursuit]]'' (1943), also with Walsh as director, was a war film set in Canada. He then made a film for his own production company, Thomson Productions, where he had a say in the choice of vehicle, director and cast, plus a portion of the profits. This picture had a modest gross of $1.5 million. ''[[Uncertain Glory]]'' (1944), was a war time drama set in France with Flynn as a criminal who redeems himself. However, it was not a success and Thomson Productions made no more movies. In 1943, Flynn earned $175,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety155-1944-07#page/n94/mode/1up|title=Treasury Lists Over $75,000 Salary|newspaper=Variety|date=19 July 1944|page=21|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Walsh he made ''[[Objective, Burma!]]'' in 1944, released in 1945, a war film set during the [[Burma Campaign]]. Although popular, it was withdrawn in Britain after protests that the role played by British troops was not given sufficient credit.&lt;ref&gt;Basinger (2009), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;  A Western, ''[[San Antonio (film)|San Antonio]]'' (1945), was also very popular grossing $3.553 million in the US and was Warner Bros. 3rd biggest hit of the year.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Post-war career===
Flynn tried comedy again with ''[[Never Say Goodbye (1946 film)|Never Say Goodbye]]'' (1946), a comedy of remarriage opposite [[Eleanor Parker]], but it was not a success, grossing $1.77 million in the US. In 1946, Flynn published an adventure novel, ''[[Showdown (Flynn novel)|Showdown]]'', and earned a reported [[$]]184,000 ({{Inflation|US|184000|1946|r=-4|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref&gt;"M'CAREY'S WAGE OF $1,113,035 YEAR'S HIGHEST: Treasury Report Places Film Producer First", ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' (1923-1963)[Chicago, Illinois], 17 June 1946, pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Cry Wolf (1947 film)|Cry Wolf]]'' (1947) was a thriller with Flynn in a seemingly more villainous role. It was a moderate success at the box office. He was in a melodrama, ''[[Escape Me Never (1947 film)|Escape Me Never]]'' (1947), filmed in early 1946 but not released until late 1947, which lost money.  More popular was a Western with Walsh and [[Ann Sheridan]], ''[[Silver River (film)|Silver River]]'' (1948). This was a hit, although its high cost meant it was not very profitable. Flynn drank so heavily on the set that he was effectively disabled after noon, and a disgusted Walsh terminated their business relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/silverriver.htm|title=silverriver|website=homepages.sover.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warners tried returning Flynn to swashbucklers and the result was ''[[Adventures of Don Juan]]'' (1948). The film was very successful in Europe, grossing $3.1 million, but less so in the U.S., with $1.9, and struggled to recoup its large budget. Still, it was Warner Bros. 4th biggest hit of the year. From this point on, Warner Bros reduced the budgets of Flynn's films. In November 1947 Flynn signed a 15-year contract with [[Warner Bros.]] for $225,000 per film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/variety168-1947-12#page/n195/mode/1up "Flynn's Fancy WB Pact"], ''Variety'', December 1947; retrieved 22 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; His income totaled $214,000 that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety169-1948-02#page/n195/mode/1up|title=Variety (February 1948)|website=Archive.org|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $200,000 in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety173-1949-02#page/n69/mode/2up|title=Variety (February 1949)|website=Archive.org|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later Warner films===
[[File:Errol Flynn in That Forsyte Woman.JPG|thumb|Flynn in ''[[That Forsyte Woman]]'' (1949).]]
After a cameo in Warner Bros' ''[[It's a Great Feeling]]'' (1949), Flynn was borrowed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] to appear in ''[[That Forsyte Woman]]'' (1949) which made $1.855 million in the US and $1.842 million abroad which was the 11th biggest hit of the year for MGM.  He went on a three-month holiday then made two medium budget Westerns for Warners, ''[[Montana (1950 film)|Montana]]'' (1950), which made $2.1 million and was Warner Bros.' 5th biggest movie of the year, and ''[[Rocky Mountain (film)|Rocky Mountain]]'' (1950), which made $1.7 million in the US and was Warner Bros. 9th biggest movie of the year. He returned to MGM for ''[[Kim (1950 film)|Kim]]'' (1950), one of Flynn's most popular movies from this period, grossing $5.348 million ($2.896 million in the US plus $2.452 million abroad) making it MGM's 5th biggest movie of the year and 11th overall for Hollywood. It was shot partly in India. On his way home he shot some scenes for a film he produced, ''[[Hello God]]'' (1951), directed by William Marshall; it was never released and remains a [[lost film]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Flynn wrote and co-produced his next film, the low budget ''[[Adventures of Captain Fabian]]'' (1951), directed by Marshall and shot in France. Flynn wound up suing Marshall in court over both movies. For Warners he appeared in an adventure tale set in the Philippines, ''[[Mara Maru]]'' (1952). That studio released a documentary of a 1946 voyage he had taken on his yacht, ''[[Cruise of the Zaca]]'' (1952). In August 1951 he signed a one-picture deal to make a movie for Universal, in exchange for a percentage of the profits: this was ''[[Against All Flags]]'' (1952), a popular swashbuckler. As early as 1952 he had been seriously ill with [[hepatitis]] resulting in liver damage.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, Errol ''My Wicked, Wicked Ways'' (1959), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In England he made another swashbuckler for Warners, ''[[The Master of Ballantrae (1953 film)|The Master of Ballantrae]]'' (1953). After that Warners ended their contract with him and their association that had lasted for 18 years and 35 films.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pryor, 'ERROL FLYNN ENDS PACT AT WARNERS: ACTOR AND STUDIO AGREE TO PART — STAR MADE 35 FILMS IN 20 YEARS ON LOT', ''New York Times'' (1923-Current file) [New York, NY], 20 March 1954, pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Flynn relocated his career to Europe. He made a swashbuckler in Italy, ''[[Crossed Swords (1954 film)|Crossed Swords]]'' (1954). This inspired him to produce a similar movie in that country, ''[[The Story of William Tell]]'' (1954), directed by [[Jack Cardiff]] with Flynn in the title role. The movie fell apart during production and ruined Flynn financially. Desperate for money, he accepted an offer from [[Herbert Wilcox]] to support [[Anna Neagle]] in a British musical, ''[[Lilacs in the Spring]]'' (1954). Also shot in Britain was ''[[The Dark Avenger]]'' (1955), for Allied Artists, in which Flynn played [[Edward, the Black Prince]]. Wilcox used him with Neagle again, in ''[[King's Rhapsody (film)|King's Rhapsody]]'' (1955), but it was not a success, ending plans for further Wilcox-Flynn collaborations. In 1956 he presented and sometimes performed in the television [[anthology series]] ''The Errol Flynn Theatre'' that was filmed in [[UK|Britain]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Hollywood comeback===
Flynn received an offer to make his first Hollywood film in five years: ''[[Istanbul (film)|Istanbul]]'' (1957), for Universal. He made a thriller shot in Cuba, ''[[The Big Boodle]]'' (1957), then had his best role in a long time in the blockbuster ''[[The Sun Also Rises (1957 film)|The Sun Also Rises]]'' (1957) for producer [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] which made $3 million in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Flynn's performance in the latter was well received and led to a series of roles where he played drunks. Warner Bros cast him as [[John Barrymore]] in ''[[Too Much, Too Soon]]'' (1958), and Zanuck used him again in ''[[The Roots of Heaven (film)|The Roots of Heaven]]'' which made $3.0 million (1958). He met with [[Stanley Kubrick]] to discuss a role in ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'', but nothing came of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Robert Osborne|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN0527616820070905|title=Errol Flynn's daughter remembers notorious dad|agency=Reuters|date=5 September 2007|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn went to Cuba in late 1958 to film the self-produced [[B movie|B film]] ''[[Cuban Rebel Girls]]'', where he met [[Fidel Castro]] and was initially an enthusiastic supporter of the [[Cuban Revolution]]. He wrote a series of newspaper and magazine articles for the ''[[New York Journal American]]'' and other publications documenting his time in Cuba with Castro. Many of these pieces were lost until 2009, when they were rediscovered in a collection at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]'s Center for American History.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Humphries|first=Patrick|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8298582.stm|title=Errol Flynn's Cuban adventures|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He narrated a short film titled ''[[Cuban Story]]: The Truth About Fidel Castro Revolution'' (1959), his last known work as an actor.

==Personal life==

Flynn developed a reputation for womanizing, hard drinking, [[chain smoking]], and, for a time in the 1940s, [[narcotics]] abuse.&lt;ref&gt;McNulty, T. ''Errol Flynn: The Life and Career''. McFarland (2004), p. 84. {{ISBN|0786417501}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was linked romantically with [[Lupe Vélez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Weissmuller, Jr., Reed|2008|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marlene Dietrich]], and [[Dolores del Río]], among many others. [[Carole Lombard]] is said to have resisted his advances, but invited him to her extravagant parties.&lt;ref&gt;McNulty (2004), pp. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a regular attendee of [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s equally lavish affairs at [[Hearst Castle]], though he was once asked to leave after becoming excessively intoxicated.&lt;ref&gt;Hearst Castle's Liquid Legacy. ''Wine Enthusiast'', September 2016, pp. 19-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression "[[in like Flynn]]" is said to have been coined to refer to the supreme ease with which he reputedly seduced women, though there is dispute about its origin.&lt;ref&gt;McNulty, T. ''Errol Flynn: The Life and Career''. McFarland (2011), p. 143; ASIN B00OYV18WU.&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn was reportedly fond of the expression, and later claimed that he wanted to call his memoir ''In Like Me''.

Flynn had various mirrors and hiding places constructed inside his mansion, including an overhead trapdoor above a guest bedroom for surreptitious viewing.  The [[Rolling Stones]] guitarist [[Ron Wood]] toured the house as a prospective buyer in the 1970s, and reported, "Errol had two-way mirrors... speaker systems in the ladies room.  Not for security.

===Marriages and family===
[[File:Damita &amp; Flynn.jpg|upright|thumb|Flynn and first wife [[Lili Damita]] at Los Angeles airport in 1941]]
Flynn was married three times: to actress [[Lili Damita]] from 1935 until 1942 (one son, [[Sean Flynn (photojournalist)|Sean Flynn]], 1941 – c. June 1971); to [[Nora Eddington]] from 1943 – 49 (two daughters, Deirdre, born 1945, and Rory, born 1947); and to actress [[Patrice Wymore]] from 1950 until his death (one daughter, Arnella Roma, 1953 – 98).

While Flynn acknowledged his personal attraction to Olivia de Havilland, assertions by film historians that they were romantically involved during the filming of ''Robin Hood''&lt;ref&gt;Rudy Behlmer in the Special Edition release of ''Robin Hood'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; were denied by de Havilland. "Yes, we did fall in love and I believe that this is evident in the screen chemistry between us," she told an interviewer in 2009. "But his circumstances [Flynn's marriage to Damita] at the time prevented the relationship going further. I have not talked about it a great deal but the relationship was not consummated. Chemistry was there though. It was there."&lt;ref&gt;Leach, B.

After quitting Hollywood, Flynn lived with Wymore in [[Port Antonio, Jamaica]] in the early 1950s. He was largely responsible for developing tourism to this area and for a while owned the Titchfield Hotel which was decorated by the artist [[Olga Lehmann]]. He popularised trips down rivers on bamboo rafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0033.html|title=The History of Jamaica – Captivated by Jamaica|publisher=Jamaica-gleaner.com|date=27 August 2002|accessdate=14 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717100529/http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0033.html|archivedate=17 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His only son, Sean (born 31 May 1941), was an actor and war correspondent.

By 1959, Flynn's financial difficulties had become so serious that he flew to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] on 9 October to negotiate the lease of his yacht ''Zaca'' to the businessman George Caldough. As Caldough was driving Flynn and the young actress [[Beverly Aadland]], who had accompanied him on the trip, to the airport on 14 October for a Los Angeles-bound flight, Flynn began complaining of severe pain in his back and legs. Caldough transported him to the residence of a doctor, Grant Gould, who noted that Flynn had considerable difficulty navigating the building's stairway. Gould, assuming that the pain was due to [[degenerative disc disease]] and spinal [[osteoarthritis]], administered 50 milligrams of [[demerol]] [[intravenously]]. As Flynn's discomfort diminished, he "reminisced at great length about his past experiences" to those present. He refused a drink when offered it.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Vancouver coroner from a physician, Dr. Grant Gould. [https://www.scribd.com/doc/63622634/Errol-Flynn-autopsy#scribd Errol Flynn autopsy], Scribd.com; retrieved 24 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gould then performed a leg massage in the apartment's bedroom and advised Flynn to rest there before resuming his journey. Flynn responded that he felt "ever so much better." After 20&amp;nbsp;minutes Aadland checked on Flynn and discovered him unresponsive. Despite immediate emergency medical treatment from Gould and a swift transferral by ambulance to [[Vancouver General Hospital]], he did not regain consciousness and was pronounced dead that evening. The coroner's report and the death certificate noted the cause of death as [[myocardial infarction]] due to [[coronary thrombosis]] and [[coronary atherosclerosis]], with [[fatty liver|fatty degeneration of liver]] and portal [[cirrhosis of the liver]] significant enough to be listed as contributing factors.&lt;ref&gt;Vancouver coroner's autopsy report, Errol Flynn.

In 1980, author [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]] wrote a controversial biography, ''Errol Flynn: The Untold Story'', alleging that Flynn was a fascist sympathiser who spied for the [[Nazi]]s before and during the Second World War, and that he was [[bisexual]] and had multiple same-sex affairs.&lt;ref name="higham"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Higham|first=Charles|title=Errol Flynn: The Untold Story|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|year=1980|isbn=0-385-13495-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed Flynn had arranged to have ''Dive Bomber'' filmed on location at the [[San Diego Naval Base]] for the benefit of Japanese military planners, who needed information on American warships and defense installations.&lt;ref name="People"/&gt; Higham admitted that he had no evidence that Flynn was a German agent, but said he had “pieced together a mosaic that proves that he is."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/books/charles-higham-celebrity-biographer-dies-at-81.html|title=Charles Higham, Celebrity Biographer, Dies at 81|last=Fox|first=Margalit|date=3 May 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn's friend [[David Niven]] criticised Higham for his unfounded accusations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Higham (biographer)|Higham, Charles]].

In a 1982 interview with ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazine, [[Ronald DeWolf]], son of the author [[L. Ron Hubbard]], said that his father's friendship with Flynn was so strong that Hubbard's family considered Flynn an adoptive father to DeWolf. He said that Flynn and his father engaged in illegal activities together, including drug smuggling and sexual acts with under-age girls; but Flynn never joined Hubbard's religious group, [[Scientology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 1983|title=Inside The Church of Scientology: An Exclusive Interview with L. Ron Hubbard, Jr.|journal=Penthouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[George Seldes]], who disliked Flynn intensely, wrote in his 1987 memoir that Flynn did not travel to Spain in 1937 to report on its civil war as announced, nor to deliver cash, medicine, supplies, and food for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] soldiers as promised.  His purpose, according to Seldes, was to perpetrate a pre-planned [[hoax]] that he triggered by sending an "apparently harmless" telegram from Madrid to Paris. The following day, American newspapers published an erroneous report that Flynn had been killed at the Spanish front. "The next day he left Spain.... There were no ambulances, no medical supplies, no food for the Spanish Republic, and not one cent of money. The war correspondents said bitterly that it was the cruelest hoax of the time. Flynn ... had used a terrible war just to advertise one of his cheap movies," Seldes wrote.&lt;ref name=Seldes&gt;{{cite book|title=Witness to a Century: Encounters with the Noted, the Notorious, and the Three SOBs|last=Seldes|first=George|location=New York|publisher=Ballantine Books|page=324|year=1987}}; {{ISBN|0345331818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
By 2004, critics alleged that torture was used against subjects with the knowledge or acquiescence of the United States (a transfer of anyone to anywhere for the purpose of torture is a violation of US law).&lt;ref name=bbc2004jan23 /&gt;&lt;ref name=statesman2004may17&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/node/147955 America's gulag]. By Stephen Grey. 17 May 2004. ''[[New Statesman]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some former detainees claimed to have been transferred to other countries for interrogation under torture, such as the Australian citizen [[Mamdouh Habib]]. In December 2005 [[Condoleezza Rice]] (then the [[United States Secretary of State]]) stated that:&lt;ref name=rice1&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Upon Her Departure for Europe, 5 Dec 2005|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/57602.htm|publisher=U.S. State Department|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;-- The United States has not transported anyone, and will not transport anyone, to a country when we believe he will be tortured. Where appropriate, the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 2001 to 2005 CIA officers captured an estimated 150 people and transported them around the world.&lt;ref name="NYT-17-Feb-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA-Background-Memo"&gt;"[https://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/082409/olcremand/2004olc97.pdf Background Paper on CIA's Combined Use of Interrogation Techniques]". 30 December 2004.

Retrieved 29 March 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], rendered persons were reported to have undergone torture by the receiving countries. Journalists, civil and constitutional rights groups, and former detainees have alleged that this occurred with the knowledge or cooperation of the administrations of the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="britain-condemned"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/4963949/Britain-condemned-over-extraordinary-rendition.html|title=Britain condemned over extraordinary rendition|first=Rosa|last=Prince|date=21 August 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revelations about the US program prompted several official investigations in Europe into alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving [[Council of Europe]] member states. A [[#27 June 2006 Council of Europe resolution|June 2006 report]] from the Council of Europe estimated 100 people had been kidnapped by the CIA on EU territory (with the cooperation of Council of Europe members), and rendered to other countries, often after having transited through secret detention centers ("[[black site]]s") used by the CIA, some located in Europe. According to the separate [[#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|European Parliament report of February 2007]], the CIA has conducted 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where suspects could face torture, in violation of article 3 of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta06/ERES1507.htm Resolution 1507 (2006).]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612123848/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta06%2FERES1507.htm |date=12 June 2010 }} Alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers of detainees involving Council of Europe member states&lt;/ref&gt; A large majority of the [[European Union Parliament]] endorsed the report's conclusion that many member states tolerated illegal actions by the CIA, and criticized several European governments and intelligence agencies for their unwillingness to cooperate with the investigation.

== Definitions ==
[[Rendition (law)|Rendition]], in law, is a transfer of persons from one jurisdiction to another, and the act of handing over, both after legal proceedings and according to law. "Extraordinary rendition," however, is a rendition which is extralegal, i.e. outside the law (see: [[kidnapping]]). Rendition refers to the transfer; the apprehension, detention, interrogation, and any other practices occurring before and after the movement and exchange of extrajudicial prisoners do not fall into the strict definition of ''extraordinary rendition''. In practice, the term is widely used to describe such practices, particularly the initial apprehension. This latter usage extends to the transfer of suspected terrorists by the US to countries known to torture prisoners or to employ harsh interrogation techniques that may rise to the level of torture.&lt;ref name="MJC-2009-09-08"&gt;Michael John Garcia, Legislative Attorney American Law Division. [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL32890.pdf "Renditions: Constraints Imposed by Laws on Torture"], 8 September 2009; link from the United States [http://www.counterterrorismtraining.gov/leg/index.html Counter-Terrorism Training and Resources for Law Enforcement web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014042245/http://www.counterterrorismtraining.gov/leg/index.html |date=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bush administration freely admitted to this practice; stating, among other provisions, that they have specifically asked that torture not be used. Torture can still occur, however, despite these provisions, and much documentation exists alleging that it has happened in many cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4502986.stm "Rendition: Tales of Torture"], BBC News Online, 7 December 2005. Retrieved 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="italydidntknow" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/02/15/arar-agent.html "Mystery surrounds former customs agent in Arar case"], CBC.CA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo050906 /&gt; In these instances, the initial captor allows the possibility of torture by releasing the prisoner into the custody of nations that practice torture.

The next distinction of degree is that of intent, where much of the search for evidence continues. It has been alleged that some of those detainees have been tortured with the knowledge, acquiescence, or even participation of US agencies. A transfer of anyone to anywhere for the purpose of torture would be a violation of US law.&lt;ref name="MJC-2009-09-08" /&gt; New York attorney Marc D. Falkoff stated that such evidence, i.e. transfer for the purposes of torture, was an operational practice. In a court filing, Falkoff described a classified prisoner transfer memo from [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo]] as noting that information could not be retrieved, as torture could not be used, and recommending that the prisoner be sent to a nation that practiced torture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/938331331.html?dids=938331331:938331331&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Dec+8%2C+2005&amp;author=Ken+Silverstein&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.10&amp;desc=Pentagon+Memo+on+Torture-Motivated+Transfer+Cited%3B+A+court+filing+describes+a+classified+proposal+to+send+a+detainee+away+for+information+extraction.

== Historical instances ==

=== Historical cases ===
An early case involves [[Adolf Eichmann#Capture in Argentina|Israel's rendition of Adolf Eichmann]] from Argentina in 1960.

The first well-known American rendition case involved the ''[[MS Achille Lauro|Achille Lauro]]'' hijackers in 1985: after they were given a plane and were en route in international air space, they were forced by [[United States Navy]] fighter planes to land at the [[Naval Air Station Sigonella]], an Italian military base in [[Sicily]] used by the US Navy and [[NATO]]. The US was trying to get them within judicial reach of [[United States government]] representatives for transport to and trial in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Clancy, [[Carl Stiner]], Tony Koltz (2002), ''Shadow Warriors: Inside the Special Forces''. {{ISBN|0-399-14783-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1987, during the Reagan administration, the United States executed an extraordinary rendition, code named "Goldenrod," in a joint FBI-CIA operation. Agents lured [[Fawaz Yunis]], who was wanted in the U.S. courts for his role in the hijacking of a Jordanian airliner that had American citizens on board, onto a boat off the coast of Cyprus and taken to international waters, where he was arrested.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Reagan administration did not undertake this kidnapping lightly. Then-FBI Director [[William H. Webster]] had opposed an earlier bid to snatch Yunis, arguing that the United States should not adopt the tactics of Israel, which had abducted [[Adolf Eichmann]] on a residential street in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1960 ... In 1984 and 1986, during a wave of terrorist attacks, Congress passed laws making air piracy and attacks on Americans abroad federal crimes. Ronald Reagan added teeth to these laws by signing a secret covert-action directive in 1986 that authorized the CIA to kidnap, anywhere abroad, foreigners wanted for terrorism. A new word entered the dictionary of U.S. foreign relations: rendition.&lt;ref name="Naftali" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] alleges that extraordinary rendition was developed during the [[Clinton administration]]. CIA officials in the mid-1990s were trying to track down and dismantle [[Islamic fundamentalism|militant Islamic]] organizations in the Middle East, particularly [[Al Qaeda]].&lt;ref name="ACLU-Fact-Sheet" /&gt;

According to Clinton administration official [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]]:

{{quote|'extraordinary renditions', were operations to apprehend terrorists abroad, usually without the knowledge of and almost always without public acknowledgment of the host government ... The first time I proposed a snatch, in 1993, the White House Counsel, Lloyd Cutler, demanded a meeting with the President to explain how it violated international law. Clinton had seemed to be siding with Cutler until Al Gore belatedly joined the meeting, having just flown overnight from South Africa. Clinton recapped the arguments on both sides for Gore: 'Lloyd says this. Dick says that.' Gore laughed and said, 'That's a no-brainer. Of course it's a violation of international law, that's why it's a covert action. The guy is a terrorist. Go grab his ass.'&lt;ref&gt;Richard Clarke, [[#References|Enemies]] pp143–4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Both the Reagan and Clinton cases involved apprehending known terrorists abroad, by covert means if necessary. The Bush administration expanded the policy after the [[9/11 attacks]].

In a ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' interview with CIA veteran [[Michael Scheuer]], an author of the rendition program under the Clinton administration, writer [[Jane Mayer]] noted,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1995, American agents proposed the rendition program to Egypt, making clear that it had the resources to track, capture, and transport terrorist suspects globally—including access to a small fleet of aircraft. Egypt embraced the idea ... 'What was clever was that some of the senior people in Al Qaeda were Egyptian,' Scheuer said. 'It served American purposes to get these people arrested, and Egyptian purposes to get these people back, where they could be interrogated.' Technically, U.S. law requires the CIA to seek 'assurances' from foreign governments that rendered suspects won't be tortured. Scheuer told me that this was done, but he was 'not sure' if any documents confirming the arrangement were signed.&lt;ref name="mayer" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scheuer testified in 2007 before Congress that no such assurances were received.&lt;ref&gt;"I have read and been told that Mr. Clinton, Mr. Berger and Mr. Clarke have said, since 9/11, that they insisted that each receiving country treat the rendered person it received according to U.S. legal standards. To the best of my memory, that is a lie." [http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/34712.pdf ''Extraordinary Rendition in U.S. Counter terrorism Policy: The Impact on Transatlantic Relations''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101093745/http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/34712.pdf |date=1 November 2007 }}, House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight, Subcommittee on Europe, 17 April 2007, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged that treatment of prisoners may not have been "up to U.S. standards." He stated,

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a matter of no concern as the Rendition Program's goal was to protect America, and the rendered fighters delivered to Middle Eastern governments are now either dead or in places from which they cannot harm America. Mission accomplished, as the saying goes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/34712.pdf Extraordinary Rendition in U.S. Counter terrorism Policy: The Impact on Transatlantic Relations.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101093745/http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/34712.pdf |date=1 November 2007 }}, House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight, Subcommittee on Europe, 17 April 2007, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thereafter, with the approval of President Clinton and a presidential directive (PDD 39), the CIA elected to send suspects to Egypt, where they were turned over to the Egyptian [[Egyptian General Intelligence Service|Mukhabarat]].

=== 20th century ===
The US has used rendition increasingly as a tool in the US-led "[[war on terror]]" to deal with foreign [[defendant]]s, ignoring the normal [[extradition]] processes in international law.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Bonner: [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19777 "The CIA's Secret Torture"], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 11 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Modern methods of rendition include a form where suspects are taken into US custody but delivered to a third-party state, often without ever being on US soil, and without involving the rendering countries, termed "extraordinary rendition." Hundreds of documents retrieved from [[Foreign relations of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libyan foreign ministry]] offices in [[Tripoli]] following the [[2011 Libyan civil war]] show that the CIA and the United Kingdom's [[MI6]] rendered suspects to Libyan authorities knowing they would be tortured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/06/libyan-dissident-tortured-sues-britain |title=Libyan dissident tortured by Gaddafi to sue Britain over rendition |date=6 October 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2018 |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/9/7/discovered_files_show_us_britain_had |title=Discovered Files Show U.S., Britain Had Extensive Ties with Gaddafi Regime on Rendition, Torture |date=7 September 2011 |accessdate=6 November 2011 |publisher=Democracy Now!}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=source speaks of MI6 cooperation, it never suggests active rendition|date=June 2015}} The CIA was granted permission to use rendition (to the USA of indicted terrorists) in a [[presidential directive]] signed by US President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1995, following a procedure&lt;ref&gt;[[Presidential directive]] [https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/pdd39.htm PDD 39], 1995&lt;/ref&gt; established by US President [[George H. W. Bush]] in January 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/nsd/index.html][[National Security Directive]]&lt;span&gt; 77&lt;/span&gt;, January 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have accused the CIA of [[rendition (law)|rendering]] suspects to other countries in order to avoid US laws mandating [[due process]] and prohibiting [[torture]]. Critics have also called this practice "torture flights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Torture flights: what No 10 knew and tried to cover up | url=https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,,1689853,00.html| accessdate=23 January 2006 |work=The Guardian  |location=London  | date=19 January 2006 | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders of the practice argue that culturally informed and native-language interrogations are more successful in gaining information from suspects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18709-2005Mar8.html 'Rendition' Realities], David Ignatius, ''The Washington Post'', 9 March 2005; p.

In a number of cases, suspects caught up in the procedure were found to be innocent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/02/17/1530242 Outsourcing Torture: The Secret History of America's "Extraordinary Rendition"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225100031/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05%2F02%2F17%2F1530242 |date=25 February 2005 }}, [[Democracy Now]], 17 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In the cases of [[Khalid El-Masri]] and [[Maher Arar]], extraordinary rendition appears to have been used for innocent civilians, who also suffered lengthy detentions. The CIA has reportedly launched an investigation into such cases (which it refers to as "[[Extraordinary rendition#"Erroneous rendition"|erroneous rendition]]").

Sociological comparisons have also been drawn between incidents of extraordinary rendition and the [[death flights]] procedure implemented, most notably, by Argentina during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Jonathan Luke., 2015.

=== 21st century ===
Following the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] the United States, in particular the [[CIA]], has been accused of rendering hundreds of people suspected by the government of being terrorists—or of aiding and abetting terrorist organizations—to third-party states such as Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Uzbekistan. Such "[[ghost detainees]]" are kept outside [[judicial]] oversight, often without ever entering US territory, and may or may not ultimately be transferred to the custody of the United States.&lt;ref name="mayer"&gt;Mayer, Jane. ''The New Yorker'', 14 February 2005. {{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?050214fa_fact6|title=Outsourcing Torture: The secret history of America's 'extraordinary rendition' program.|accessdate=20 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the former CIA case officer [[Bob Baer]], "If you want a serious interrogation, you send a prisoner to Jordan. If you want them to be tortured, you send them to Syria. If you want someone to [[Forced disappearance|disappear]]—never to see them again—you send them to Egypt."&lt;ref name="CP05-12-05"&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/rajiva12052005.html Lila Rajiva, "The CIA's Rendition Flights to Secret Prisons: The Torture-Go-Round"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814072703/http://www.counterpunch.org/rajiva12052005.html |date=14 August 2011 }}, ''CounterPunch'', 5 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 4 December 2005 article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' by [[Dana Priest]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Members of the Rendition Group follow a simple but standard procedure: Dressed head to toe in black, including masks, they blindfold and cut the clothes off their new captives, then administer an [[enema]] and sleeping drugs. They outfit detainees in a diaper and jumpsuit for what can be a day-long trip. Their destinations: either a detention facility operated by cooperative countries in the Middle East and Central Asia, including Afghanistan, or one of the CIA's own covert prisons—referred to in classified documents as "black sites", which at various times have been operated in eight countries, including several in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="WaPo051204"&gt;{{cite news | author=Dana Priest | title=Wrongful Imprisonment: Anatomy of a CIA Mistake | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/03/AR2005120301476.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 | work=The Washington Post | date=4 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following mounting scrutiny in Europe, including investigations held by the [[Swiss people|Swiss]] senator [[Dick Marty]] who released a public report in June 2006, the [[United States Senate|US Senate]], in December 2005, was about to approve a measure that would include amendments requiring the Director of National Intelligence to provide regular, detailed updates about secret detention facilities maintained by the United States overseas, and to account for the treatment and condition of each prisoner.&lt;ref name="NyTimes051215"&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate is Set to Require White House to Account for Secret Prisons |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1071FFA34550C768DDDAB0994DD404482 |date=15 December 2005 |accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The New York Times |first=Douglas |last=Jehl |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408042758/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1071FFA34550C768DDDAB0994DD404482 |archivedate=8 April 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"He says he was flown on what he believes was a US aircraft to Morocco, while shackled, blindfolded and wearing earphones"&lt;/ref&gt; The reports also say that the rendering countries have provided interrogators with lists of questions.

==== Boeing Jeppesen international trip planning ====
On 23 October 2006, the ''New Yorker'' reported that [[Jeppesen]], a subsidiary of [[Boeing]], handled the logistical planning for the CIA's extraordinary rendition flights. The allegation is based on information from an ex-employee who quoted Bob Overby, managing director of the company as saying "We do all of the extraordinary rendition flights—you know, the torture flights. Let's face it, some of these flights end up that way. It certainly pays well." The article went on to suggest that this may make Jeppesen a potential defendant in a lawsuit by [[Khaled El-Masri]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/articles/061030ta_talk_mayer The C.I.A.'s Travel Agent], Jane Mayer, ''The New Yorker'', 23 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeppesen was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the [[ACLU]] on 30 May 2007, on behalf of several other individuals who were allegedly subject to extraordinary rendition.

The suit was dismissed on 8 September 2010 by a federal appeals court on the grounds that "going forward would reveal state secrets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/08/AR2010090807334.html |title=Suit dismissed against firm in CIA rendition case |date=9 September 2010 |author=Peter Finn |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Black sites" ===
In 2005, ''The Washington Post'' and [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) published revelations concerning CIA flights and "[[black site]]s", covert prisons operated by the CIA and whose existence is denied by the US government. The [[European Parliament]] published a report in February 2007 concerning the use of such secret detention centers and extraordinary rendition (''[[Extraordinary rendition#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|See below]]''). These detention centers violate the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) and the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|UN Convention Against Torture]], treaties that all EU member states are bound to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Europeans Probe Secret CIA Flights | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/16/AR2005111602198.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The Washington Post | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | date=17 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= EU to look into 'secret US jails' | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4403166.stm | accessdate=18 December 2005 |publisher=BBC News  | date=3 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=U.S. Faces Scrutiny Over Secret Prisons | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/03/AR2005110300422.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The Washington Post | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | date=4 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ABC News]] two such facilities, in countries mentioned by Human Rights Watch, have been closed following the recent publicity. CIA officers say the captives were relocated to the North African desert. All but one of these 11 high-value [[al Qaeda]] prisoners were subjected to the harshest interrogation techniques in the CIA's secret arsenal, sometimes referred to as "[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]" authorized for use by about 14 CIA officers.&lt;ref name="AbcNews051205"&gt;{{cite news | title=Exclusive: Sources Tell ABC News Top Al Qaeda Figures Held in Secret CIA Prisons | url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1375123 | accessdate=18 December 2005 | publisher=ABC News | date=5 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criticisms of ''The Washington Post'''s decision to withhold locations of the black sites ====
A comment by [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|FAIR]]&lt;ref name="FAIR 2005" /&gt; on ''The Washington Post'''s decision to withhold the locations of these secret prisons was that since the revelations "could open the [[U.S. government]] to legal challenges, particularly in foreign courts, and increase the risk of political condemnation at home and abroad," the ''Post'' did its part to minimize these risks. Yet, according to FAIR, "the possibility that illegal, unpopular government actions might be disrupted is not a consequence to be feared, however—it's the whole point of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|U.S. First Amendment]]. ... Without the basic fact of where these prisons are, it's difficult if not impossible for 'legal challenges' or 'political condemnation' to force them to close." FAIR argued that the damage done to the global reputation of the United States by the continued existence of black-site prisons was more dangerous than any threat caused by the exposure of their locations.&lt;ref name="FAIR 2005"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Consequences of Covering Up | url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2715 | accessdate=18 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Raw Story]]'', the Polish site identified by reporter [[Larisa Alexandrovna]] and Polish intelligence officer [[David Dastych]] is [[Stare Kiejkuty (base)|Stare Kiejkuty]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;The complex at Stare Kiejkuty, a Soviet-era compound once used by German intelligence in World War II, is best known as having been the only Russian intelligence training school to operate outside the Soviet Union. Its prominence in the Soviet era suggests that it may have been the facility first identified—but never named—when the Washington Post's Dana Priest revealed the existence of the CIA's secret prison network in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Soviet-era compound in northern Poland was site of secret CIA interrogation, detentions | url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2007/Sovietera_compound_in_Poland_was_site_0307.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both Alexandrovna and Dastych have stated that their sources told them that the same information and documents were provided to ''The Washington Post'' in 2005. In addition, they also identified the methodology of concealing the black sites:

{{quote|Former European and US intelligence officials indicate that the secret prisons across the European Union, first identified by the Washington Post, are likely not permanent locations, making them difficult to identify and locate.

What some believe was a network of secret prisons was most probably a series of facilities used temporarily by the United States when needed, officials say. Interim "black sites"—secret facilities used for covert activities—can be as small as a room in a government building, which only becomes a black site when a prisoner is brought in for short-term detainment and interrogation.}}

They go on to explain that "Such a site, sources say, would have to be near an airport." The airport in question is the [[Szczytno-Szymany International Airport]], according to Alexandrovna and Dastych.

In response to these allegations, former Polish intelligence chief, [[Zbigniew Siemiatkowski]], embarked on a media blitz and claimed that the allegations made by Alexandrovna and Dastych were "... part of the domestic political battle in the US over who is to succeed current Republican President George W Bush," according to the German news agency Deutsche Presse Agentur."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Former Polish intelligence chief who says report on CIA detention site part of US domestic battle admitted CIA had access to facility | url=http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Former_Polish_intelligence_chief_who_says_0308.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prison ships ====
The United States has also been accused of operating "[[Prison ship|floating prisons]]" to house and transport those arrested in its [[war on terror#US objectives|''War on Terror'']], according to human rights lawyers. They have claimed that the US has tried to conceal the numbers and whereabouts of detainees. Although no credible information to support these assertions has ever come to light, the alleged justification for prison ships is primarily to remove the ability for jihadists to target a fixed location to facilitate the escape of high value targets, commanders, operations chiefs etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Duncan Campbell |author2=Richard Norton-Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/02/usa.humanrights |title=US accused of holding terror suspects on prison ships |work=The Guardian  |location=London |date= 2 June 2008|accessdate=17 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, the Italian judge Guido Salvini issued a warrant for the arrest of 13 persons said to be agents or operatives of the CIA in association with Nasr's kidnapping. In December 2005, an Italian court issued a [[European arrest warrant]] against 22 CIA agents suspected of this kidnapping (including [[Robert Seldon Lady]], [[Eliana Castaldo]], Lt. Col. [[Joseph L.

On 6 December 2005, ''The Washington Post'' reported Italian court documents which showed that the CIA tried to mislead Italian anti-terrorism police who were looking for the cleric at the time. Robert S. Lady, the CIA's substation chief in Milan, has been implicated in the abduction.

[[Marco Mancini]], the [[SISMI]] director of anti-terrorism and counterespionage, and Gustavo Pignero, the department's director in 2003, have been arrested on charges of complicity in a kidnapping, with the aggravating circumstances of [[abuse of power]].

=== Majid Mahmud Abdu Ahmad case ===
{{Main|Majid Mahmud Abdu Ahmad}}
A story in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on 8 December 2005 seems to corroborate the claims of "torture by proxy." It mentions the attorneys for [[Majid Mahmud Abdu Ahmad]], a detainee held by the Pentagon at Guantanamo Bay, filed a petition to prevent his being transferred to foreign countries. According to the petition's description of a redacted classified [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] memo from 17 March 2004, its contents say  "officials suggested sending Ahmad to an unspecified foreign country that employed torture in order to increase chances of extracting information from him."

Mr Falkoff, representing Ahmad, continued: "There is only one meaning that can be gleaned from this short passage," the petition says. "The government believes that Mr. Ahmad has information that it wants but that it cannot extract without torturing him." The petition goes on to say that because torture is not allowed at Guantanamo, "the recommendation is that Mr. Ahmad should be sent to another country where he can be interrogated under torture."&lt;ref name="LaTimes051208"&gt;{{Cite news

=== Maher Arar case ===
{{Main|Maher Arar}}
Maher Arar, a Syrian-born dual Syrian and Canadian citizen, was detained at [[Kennedy International Airport]] on 26 September 2002, by US [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] officials. He was heading home to Canada after a family holiday in Tunisia. After almost two weeks, enduring hours of interrogation chained, he was sent, shackled and bound, in a private jet to Jordan and then Syria, instead of being deported to Canada. There, he was interrogated and tortured by Syrian intelligence. Maher Arar was eventually released a year later. He told the BBC that he was repeatedly tortured during 10 months' detention in Syria—often whipped on the palms of his hands with metal cables. Syrian intelligence officers forced him to sign a [[Confession (law)|confession]] linking him to [[Al Qaeda]].

He was finally released following intervention by the Canadian government. The Canadian government lodged an official complaint with the US government protesting Arar's deportation. On 18 September 2006, a Canadian public enquiry presented its findings, entirely clearing Arar of any terrorist activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sirc-csars.gc.ca/pdfs/cm_arar_rec-eng.pdf |title=Report of the Events Relating to Maher Arar: Analysis and Recommendations }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.17&amp;nbsp;MB)}}, Commission of Inquiry into the Actions of Canadian Officials in Relation to Maher Arar&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 Arar filed a lawsuit in a federal court in New York against senior U.S. officials, on charges that whoever sent him to Syria knew he would be tortured by intelligence agents.&lt;ref name="Talesoftorture"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4502986.stm "Renditions: Tales of Torture"], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 7 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[US Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]], [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] Secretary [[Tom Ridge]] and [[FBI Director]] [[Robert Mueller]] were all named in the lawsuit.&lt;ref name=bbc2004jan23&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3421743.stm Canadian sues US over deportation], BBC News, 23 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a U.S. federal appeals court ruled that U.S. law did not allow victims of extraordinary rendition to sue U.S. officials for torture suffered overseas.&lt;ref name=maher_arar_appeal_rejected /&gt;

On 18 October 2006, Arar received the Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award from the [[Institute for Policy Studies]] for his ordeal. On 18 October 2007, Maher Arar received a public apology from the U.S. House of Representatives. U.S. Representative [[Dana Rohrabacher]], who apologized, stated that he would fight any efforts to end the practice.

In 2007, Arar was awarded $10.5&amp;nbsp;million in compensation from the Canadian government for pain and suffering in his ordeal and a formal apology from Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]].&lt;ref name="USlegislatorsapologize"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/10/18/arar.html U.S. legislators apologize to Maher Arar], ''CBCNews'', 18 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2002, captured Al Qaeda leader [[Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi]] was rendered to Egypt where he was allegedly tortured. The information he provided to his interrogators formed a fundamental part of the Bush administration case for attacking Iraq, alleging links between Al Qaeda and Iraq. Al-Libi later recanted his story and it is generally believed that his stories of contact between the Saddam Hussein regime and Al-Qaeda were fabricated to please his interrogators.&lt;ref name="Guardian051209"&gt;{{cite news | title=Prewar claims 'sourced from rendition detainee' | url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1663743,00.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The Guardian  |location=London | date=9 December 2005  | first=Simon | last=Jeffery}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery]], two Egyptians who had been seeking asylum in Sweden, were arrested by Swedish police in December 2001. They were taken to Bromma airport in Stockholm, had their clothes cut from their bodies, suppositories were inserted in their anuses and they were put in diapers, overalls, hoods, hand and ankle cuffs, they were then put onto a jet with [[Rendition aircraft|American registration N379P]] with a crew of masked men. They were flown to Egypt, where they were imprisoned, beaten, and tortured according to Swedish investigative programme ''Kalla fakta''.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript from a Swedish television show, "''Kalla Fakta''" (Cold Facts) in May 2004 in which the abduction is the topic.

Agiza was previously charged and sentenced in absentia with being an Islamic militant and was sentenced to 25 years, a sentence that was reduced to 15 years due to the political pressure after the Rendition became known. Al-Zery wasn't charged, and after two years in jail without ever seeing a judge or prosecutor he was sent to his village in Egypt. In 2008 AL Zery was awarded $500,000 in damages by the Swedish government for the wrongful treatment he received in Sweden and the subsequent torture in Egypt.
* In March 2002, [[Abou Elkassim Britel]], an Italian citizen with Moroccan origins, was arrested in Pakistan and subsequently interrogated by Pakistani and US officials. He was then rendered to Moroccan authorities, detained and tortured in a secret [[Temara interrogation centre]]. He was finally released without any charges brought against him, before being rearrested in May 2003 at the border crossing of the Spanish enclave of [[Melilla]] in North Africa. He is currently imprisoned in [[Äin Bourja prison]] in [[Casablanca]] after having been sentenced to nine years in January 2004 for membership of a subversive organisation and for activities including holding unauthorised meetings. This in spite of conclusions in September 2006 by Italian Justice, after a five years investigation, that there was "an absolute lack of grounds of evidence of charge which may be used in trial" and that the suspicion motivating the inquiries had proved unfounded. Nonetheless, allegations in the Italian press and the judicial proceedings that were underway in Italy influenced court proceedings against Britel in Morocco that led to him being sentenced.

==== Council of Europe investigation and its two reports ====
On 25 November 2005, the lead investigator for the [[Council of Europe]], Swiss lawmaker [[Dick Marty]] announced that he had obtained latitude and longitude coordinates for suspected black sites, and he was planning to use satellite imagery over the last several years as part of his investigation. On 28 November 2005, EU Justice Commissioner [[Franco Frattini]] asserted that any EU country which had operated a secret prison would have its voting rights suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Paul Ames |title=EU May Suspend Nations With Secret Prisons | date=28 November 2005 | publisher=[[ABC News]] | url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=1352347 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a preliminary report, Dick Marty declared that it was "highly unlikely that European governments, or at least their intelligence services, were unaware" of the CIA kidnapping of a "hundred" persons on European territory and their subsequent rendition to countries where they may be tortured.&lt;ref name="DickMarty_PDF_2006-01-22"&gt;Directed by Swiss senator Dick Marty, Entitled "Alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states," see: {{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/24_01_06_detention.pdf |title=Information memorandum II on the alleged secret detentions in Council of Europe states }}, Dick Marty, 22 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The report from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Council of Europe directed by Dick Marty, and made public on 7 June 2006, was titled: "Alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states."&lt;ref&gt;June 2006 Council of Europe report available here: [http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?Link=/CommitteeDocs/2006/20060606_Ejdoc162006PartII-FINAL.htm HTML] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060610064258/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?Link=%2FCommitteeDocs%2F2006%2F20060606_Ejdoc162006PartII-FINAL.htm |date=10 June 2006 }} and [http://assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2006/20060606_Ejdoc162006PartII-FINAL.pdf PDF] formats.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of this report, the Council of Europe published its draft Recommendation and Resolution document which
found grounds for concern with the conduct of both the US and member states of the EU and expresses concern for the disregard of international law and the Geneva Convention. Following a 23-point resolution the document makes five recommendations.
* 1 refers to its Resolution on alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states.
* 2 recalling its previous recommendation on the legality of the detention of persons by the United States in Guantanamo Bay
* 3 urges the Committee of Ministers to draft a recommendation to Council of Europe member States containing:
:common measures to guarantee more effectively the human rights of persons suspected of terrorist offences who are captured from, detained in or transported through Council of Europe member States; and a set of minimum requirements for "human rights protection clauses", for inclusion in bilateral and multilateral agreements with third parties, especially those concerning the use of military installations on the territory of Council of Europe member States.
* 4 urgently requests that: an initiative be launched on an international level, expressly involving the United States, an Observer to the Council of Europe, to develop a common, truly global strategy to address the terrorist threat. The strategy should conform in all its elements with the fundamental principles of our common heritage in terms of democracy, human rights and respect for the rule of law. Also, a proposal be considered, in instances where States are unable or unwilling to prosecute persons accused of terrorist acts, to bring these persons within the jurisdiction of an international court that is competent to try them. One possibility worth considering would be to vest such a competence in the International Criminal Court, whilst renewing invitations to join the Court to the United States and other countries that have not yet done so.
* 5 recommends improving the Council of Europe's ability to react rapidly and effectively to allegations of systematic human rights abuse involving several member States.

Several months before the publication of the Council of Europe report directed by Dick Marty, [[Gijs de Vries]], the EU's antiterrorism coordinator, asserted in April 2006 that no evidence existed that extraordinary rendition had been taking place in Europe. It was also said that the European Union's probe, and a similar one by the continent's leading human rights group had not found any human rights violations nor other crimes that could be proven to the satisfaction of the courts.&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe060421"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2006/04/21/eu_official_no_evidence_of_illegal_cia_action/ EU official: No evidence of illegal CIA action: Antiterror chief advises committee], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', 21 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This denial from a member of the [[executive power]] of the EU institutions has been questioned by the [[European Parliament]] report, which was accepted by a vast majority of the Parliament in February 2007 (''[[Extraordinary renditions#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|See below:The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report]]'').

On the other hand, Dick Marty explained the difference of approach concerning terrorism between the EU and the US as following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;While the states of the Old World have dealt with these threats primarily by means of existing institutions and legal systems, the United States appears to have made a fundamentally different choice: considering that neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism, it decided to develop new legal concepts. This legal approach is utterly alien to the European tradition and sensibility, and is clearly contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&lt;ref name="BBC_NOL_2006-06-07"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5055872.stm Rendition and the rights of the individual], ''[[BBC News]]'', 7 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, despite Marty's claims, the European Parliament investigations uncovered cooperation between European [[secret services]] and governments and the extraordinary renditions programs, making such a clear-cut distinction over-simplistic (''[[Extraordinary renditions#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|see below]]''). Dick Marty himself has not accepted such a dualistic approach, as he showed that for the British government also, the phenomenon of Islamic terrorism was alleged to be so grave that the balance of liberties had to be reconsidered.&lt;ref name="BBC_NOL_2006-06-07" /&gt; Marty's report stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The compilation of so-called "black lists" of individuals and companies suspected of maintaining connections with organisations considered terrorist and the application of the associated sanctions clearly breach every principle of the fundamental right to a fair trial: no specific charges, no right to be heard, no right of appeal, no established procedure for removing one's name from the list.&lt;ref name="BBC_NOL_2006-06-07" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second report was released on 8 June 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/marty_08_06_07.pdf |title=Secret detentions and illegal transfers of detainees involving Council of Europe member states: second report }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(528&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Council of Europe Parliamentary]] Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights, 7 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 27 June 2006 Council of Europe resolution ====
The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE) accused the United States of operating a "clandestine spiderweb of disappearances, secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers" and called for EU regulations governing foreign intelligence services operating in Europe, and demanded "human rights clauses" in military base agreements with the USA.

In a resolution and recommendation approved by a large majority, the Assembly also called for:
* The dismantling by the US of its system of detentions and transfers.
* A review of bilateral agreements between Council of Europe member states and the US, particularly on the status of US forces stationed in Europe and on the use of military and other instrastructures, to ensure they conform to international human rights norms.
* Official apologies and compensation for victims of illegal detentions against whom no formal accusations, nor any court proceedings, have ever been brought
* An international initiative, expressly involving the United States, to develop a common, truly global strategy to address the terrorist threat which conforms to democracy, human rights and the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta06/ERES1507.htm |title=Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly |publisher=Assembly.coe.int |date=27 June 2006 |accessdate=17 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612123848/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta06%2FERES1507.htm |archivedate=12 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== European Parliament's investigation and report ====
The [[European Parliament]] launched its own investigation into the reports. In April 2006, [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] leading the investigations expressed concerns that the CIA had conducted more than 1,000 secret flights over European territory since 2001, some to transfer terror suspects to countries that used torture. Investigators said that the same US agents and planes were involved over and over again.&lt;ref name="NyTimes060427"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/27/world/europe/27cia.html?ex=1303790400&amp;en=f28193a7c7a919c0&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss European Inquiry Says C.I.A. Flew 1,000 Flights in Secret], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 27 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliament adopted a resolution in July 2006 endorsing the Council of Europe's conclusions, midway through its own investigation into the alleged program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2006-0316+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN Texts adopted by Parliament. Thursday, 6 July 2006 – Strasbourg. Final edition: Extraordinary renditio]&lt;/ref&gt;

"In a resolution passed on 14 February 2007 MEPs approved by a large majority (382 voting in favour, 256 against and 74 abstaining) their committee's final report, which criticized the rendition program and concluded that many European countries tolerated illegal [[CIA]] activities including secret flights over their territories. The countries named were: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Bbc070214"&gt;{{cite news | title=EU endorses damning report on CIA | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6360817.stm | accessdate=14 February 2007 |publisher=BBC News | date=14 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report ...

{{quote|''Denounces'' the lack of co-operation of many member states and of the [[Council of the European Union]] with the investigation;

''Regrets'' that European countries have been relinquishing control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the CIA which, on some occasions, were being used for illegal transportation of detainees;

''Calls'' for the closure of [the US military detention mission in] Guantanamo and for European countries immediately to seek the return of their citizens and residents who are being held illegally by the US authorities;

''Considers'' that all European countries should initiate independent investigations into all stopovers by civilian aircraft [hired by] the CIA;

According to the report, the CIA had operated 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where suspects could face torture. The Parliament also called for the creation of an independent investigation commission and the closure of the Guantanamo camp. According to Italian Socialist [[Giovanni Fava]], who drafted the document, there was a "strong possibility" that the intelligence obtained under the illegal extraordinary rendition program had been passed on to EU governments who were aware of how it was obtained. The report also uncovered the use of secret detention facilities used in Europe, including Romania and Poland. The report defines extraordinary renditions as instances where "an individual suspected of involvement in terrorism is illegally abducted, arrested and/or transferred into the custody of US officials and/or transported to another country for interrogation which, in the majority of cases involves incommunicado detention and torture".

=== Investigations by national governments ===

==== France ====
The French [[attorney general]] of [[Bobigny]] opened up an instruction in order "to verify the presence in [[Le Bourget Airport]], on 20 July 2005, of the plane numbered N50BH." This instruction was opened following a complaint deposed in December 2005 by the ''[[Ligue des droits de l'homme]]'' (LDH) NGO ("Human Rights League") and the ''[[International Federation of Human Rights Leagues]]'' (FIDH) NGO on charges of "arbitrary detention", "crime of torture" and "non-respect of the rights of [[war prisoners]]". It has as objective to determine if the plane was used to transport CIA prisoners to [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]] and if the French authorities had knowledge of this stop. However, the lawyer defending the LDH declared that he was surprised that the instruction was only opened on 20 January 2006, and that no verifications had been done before.
On 2 December 2005, conservative newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' had revealed the existence of two CIA planes that had landed in France, suspected of transporting CIA prisoners. But the instruction concerned only N50BH, which was a [[Gulfstream III]], which would have landed at Le Bourget on 20 July 2005, coming from [[Oslo]], Norway. The other suspected aircraft would have landed in [[Brest, France|Brest]] on 31 March 2002. It is investigated by the Canadian authorities, as it would have been flying from [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]] in Canada, via [[Keflavík]] in Iceland before going to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}{{cite news | title=La France enquête sur les avions de la CIA |work=Le Figaro  |language=French |date=2 February 2006 | url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/france/20060302.FIG000000200_la_france_enquete_sur_les_avions_de_la_cia.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business daily ''[[Handelsblatt]]'' reported 24 November 2005, that the CIA used an American military base in Germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the German government. The ''[[Berliner Zeitung]]'' reported the following day there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a "high probability" of being operated by the CIA, at [[Ramstein Air Base|Ramstein]], the [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] and others. The newspaper cited experts and "[[Aircraft spotting|plane-spotters]]" who observed the planes as responsible for the tally.&lt;ref name="refbot.947"&gt;{{cite web | title=CIA Uses German Bases to Transport Terrorists, Paper Says | publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] | date=25 November 2005 | url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1792376,00.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police at [[Shannon Airport]] said that they had received political instruction not to approach, search or otherwise interfere with US aircraft suspected of being involved in extraordinary rendition flights. Irish Justice Minister [[Dermot Ahern]] sought permission from the US for random inspection of US flights, to provide political "cover" to him in case rendition flights were revealed to have used Shannon; he believed at least three flights had done so.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, Dara,[http://www.irishcentral.com/news/WikiLeaks-reveal-Justice-Ministers-Dermot-Aherns-rendition-fears-112121564.html WikiLeaks reveals Justice Minister's Dermot Ahern's rendition fears] Irish Central, 18 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Portugal ====
Portugal opened up an investigation concerning CIA flights in February 2007, on the basis of declarations by [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Ana Gomes]] and by Rui Costa Pinto, journalist of ''[[Visão]]'' review. The Portuguese general prosecutor, [[Cândida Almeida]], head of the [[Central Investigation and Penal Action Department]] (DCIAP), announced the opening of investigations on 5 February 2007. They were to be centered on the issue of "torture or inhuman and cruel treatment," and instigated by allegations of "illegal activities and serious human rights violations" made by MEP Ana Gomes to the attorney general, Pinto Monteiro, on 26 January 2007.&lt;ref name="StateFeb07"&gt;[http://www.statewatch.org/news/2007/feb/03cia-portugal.htm Portugal: Renditions: Judicial investigation into CIA flights begins], ''[[Statewatch]] News Online'', 5 February 2007 – 6 February 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, the UK NGO [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] published a report based on flight logs obtained by Ana Gomes, confirming that over 728 prisoners were flown to Guantánamo through Portuguese airspace, and hence through Portuguese jurisdiction, in at least 28 flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=www.statewatch.org|title= Portugal: Over 700 prisoners flown to Guantánamo through Portuguese airspace|url= http://www.statewatch.org/news/2008/feb/02reprieve-rendition-portugal.htm|accessdate=23 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most critic voice against the scarce collaboration provided by the Portuguese government to the European Parliament Commission which investigated CIA flights, Ana Gomes declared that, although she had no doubt that permission of these illegal flights were frequent during [[Durão Barroso]] (2002–2004) and [[Santana Lopes]] (2004–2005)' governments, "during the [Socialist] government of [[José Sócrates]] [2005– ], 24 flights which passed through Portuguese territory" are registered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europapress.es/noticia.aspx?cod=20070205202548&amp;ch=69 Portugal/CIA – La Fiscalía General abre una investigación sobre los supuestos vuelos ilegales de la CIA en Portugal], ''[[Europa Press]]'', 5 February 2007 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active in the TDIP commission, Ana Gomes complained about the Portuguese state's reluctance to provide information, leading her to tensions with the Foreign minister, [[Luís Amado]], member of the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|same party]]. Ana Gomes declared herself satisfied with the opening of the investigations, but underlined that she had always claimed that a parliamentary inquiry would be necessary.&lt;ref name="StateFeb07" /&gt;

On the other hand, journalist Rui Costa Pinto was heard by the DCIAP, as he had written an article, refused by ''Visão'', about flights passing by [[Lajes Field]], a Portuguese airbase used by the US Air Forces, in the [[Azores]].&lt;ref name="StateFeb07" /&gt;

[[Franco Frattini]] the European Union Justice Commissioner requested an explanation from the governments of Poland and Romania about the accusations made by Dick Marty. Doris Mircea (Romanian spokeswoman in [[Brussels]]) replied to this in November 2007 in a letter stating "no person was kept illegally as a prisoner within Romanian jails and no illegal transfer of detainees passed through Romanian territory" and that that was the official finding of a committee of inquiry set up by the government to investigate the accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7097253.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Romania says it had no CIA bases | date=15 November 2007 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After claims by [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] that British airports had been used by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|"CIA]] for extraordinary rendition flights, the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] launched an investigation in November 2005. The report was published in June 2007 and found no evidence to support the claim. This was on the same day the Council of Europe released its report with evidence that the UK had colluded in extraordinary rendition, thus directly contradicting ACPO's findings. Liberty has challenged the findings and has stated that its original claims were based on "credible evidence".&lt;ref name="BBC News 9 June"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6736227.stm Police reject UK rendition claims], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 9 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Khalid El-Masri]] is the most well-known person who is believed to have been subjected to the process of "extraordinary rendition", as a result of mistaken identity. [[Laid Saidi]], an Algerian detained and tortured along with El-Masri, was apprehended apparently because of a taped telephone conversation in which the word ''tirat'', meaning "tires" in Arabic, was mistaken for the word ''tairat'', meaning "airplanes".&lt;ref name="NyTimes060707" /&gt;

The Post's anonymous sources say that the Inspector General is looking into a number of similar cases—possibly as many as thirty innocent men who were captured and transported through what has been called "erroneous renditions".

A 27 December 2005 story quotes anonymous CIA insiders claiming there have been 10 or fewer such erroneous renditions.&lt;ref name="ApNews"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-12-27-cia-renditions_x.htm?POE=NEWISVA CIA watchdog probes 'renditions' of suspects], [[Associated Press]], 27 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
It names the CIA's [[inspector general]], [[John Helgerson]], as the official responsible for the inquiry.

The AP story quotes Tom Malinowski, Washington office director of Human Rights Watch who said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am glad the CIA is investigating the cases that they are aware of, but by definition you are not going to be aware of all such cases, when you have a process designed to avoid judicial safeguards.&lt;ref name="ApNews" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Obama Executive Order on rendition ==

Two days after President Barack Obama was sworn into office, on 22 January 2009, he signed an executive order entitled "Ensuring Lawful Interrogations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations |title=Ensuring Lawful Interrogations |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=19 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218212240/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations |archivedate=18 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This order specifically addresses the practice of transferring individuals to other nations in order to ensure that such practices comply with the domestic laws, international obligations, and policies of the United States.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov" /&gt; It establishes a committee that will provide recommendations within 180 days of the executive order. It specifically has as its goal a process to ensure that the United States practices do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face torture or otherwise for the purpose, or with the effect, of undermining or circumventing the commitments or obligations of the United States to ensure the humane treatment of individuals in its custody or control.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov" /&gt;

Overall, the executive order calls for more oversight of interrogation by third parties, but does not end extraordinary rendition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/us/politics/25rendition.html | title=U.S. Says Rendition to Continue, but With More Oversight | author=Johnston, David | work=The New York Times | date=24 August 2009 | accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section of the Executive Order relating to extraordinary rendition provides as follows:

{{quote|
* '''(e) Mission.'''  The mission of the Special Task Force shall be:
** '''(i)'''   to study and evaluate whether the interrogation practices and techniques in [[FM 2-22.3 Human Intelligence Collector Operations|Army Field Manual 2 22.3]], when employed by departments or agencies outside the military, provide an appropriate means of acquiring the intelligence necessary to protect the Nation, and, if warranted, to recommend any additional or different guidance for other departments or agencies; and
** '''(ii)'''  to study and evaluate the practices of transferring individuals to other nations in order to ensure that such practices comply with the domestic laws, international obligations, and policies of the United States and do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face torture or otherwise for the purpose, or with the effect, of undermining or circumventing the commitments or obligations of the United States to ensure the humane treatment of individuals in its custody or control.
* '''(f) Administration.'''  The Special Task Force shall be established for administrative purposes within the Department of Justice and the Department of Justice shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, provide administrative support and funding for the Special Task Force.
* '''(g) Recommendations.''' The Special Task Force shall provide a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Counsel to the President, on the matters set forth in subsection (d) within 180 days of the date of this order, unless the Chair determines that an extension is necessary.
* '''(h) Termination.'''  The Chair shall terminate the Special Task Force upon the completion of its duties.}}

On 2 November 2009 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that victims of extraordinary rendition cannot sue Washington for torture suffered overseas, because Congress has not authorized such lawsuits, in ruling on Canadian citizen Maher Arar's case.&lt;ref name=maher_arar_appeal_rejected&gt;{{cite web | title= Appeals Court Rules in Maher Arar Case: Innocent Victims of Extraordinary Rendition Cannot Sue in US Courts | url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/11/3/appeals_court_rules_in_maher_arar| accessdate=4 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 September 2010 [[PolitiFact.com]] wrote about the Obama administration's record on renditions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The administration has announced new procedural safeguards concerning individuals who are sent to foreign countries. President Obama also promised to shut down the CIA-run "black sites," and there seems to be anecdotal evidence that extreme renditions are not happening, at least not as much as they did during the Bush administration. Still, human rights groups say that these safeguards are inadequate and that the DOJ Task Force recommendations still allow the U.S. to send individuals to foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Obama's extreme rendition policy is issued, but results still uncertain | url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/176/end-the-use-of-extreme-rendition/ |accessdate=7 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Other Countries ==

=== CIA participating countries ===
According to a report by the [[Open Society Foundations]], 54 countries participated at one point or another with the CIA's extraordinary rendition program:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/globalizing-torture-cia-secret-detention-and-extraordinary-rendition|title=Globalizing Torture: CIA Secret Detention and Extraordinary Rendition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Branston''' (9 May 1939 – 14 August 2009) was a journalist, novelist and newspaper proprietor, and the first [[elected mayors in the United Kingdom|directly elected mayor]] of the [[Borough of Bedford]] in Bedfordshire, England.

==Early life and career==
Frank Branston was born in [[Retford]], Nottinghamshire, brought up in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], west London, and educated at Sloane Grammar School, Chelsea, leaving in 1955 aged 16. He married Marlies, originally from Germany, in 1968, and was the father of two children: Naomi (a lawyer) and Antonia (marketing).

Prior to entering politics he was a journalist, although he was for a while a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the 1970s. In 1974 he was the first journalist on a weekly newspaper to be named as the National Press Awards' Provincial Journalist of the Year. After launching his own newspaper, Bedfordshire on Sunday, in 1977, he also received a number of other awards.

Branston was the owner of five local newspapers: ''[[Bedfordshire on Sunday]]'', ''[[Luton]] on Sunday'', ''[[Hertfordshire]] on Sunday'', ''[[Leighton Buzzard]] on Sunday'' and the ''[[Milton Keynes]] News'', with a total distribution approaching 400,000. He and his wife sold their 88% stake in the newspapers in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedfordtoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=550&amp;ArticleID=1114396 Bedford Today – Sunday newspaper group is sold off] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123021212/http://www.bedfordtoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=550&amp;ArticleID=1114396 |date=23 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the author of two novels, "Sergeant Ritchie's Conscience" (1978) and "An Up and Coming Man" (1977).&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Search/Home?lookfor=author:%22Branston,%20Frank,%201939-%22&amp;iknowwhatimean=1 NLA Catalogue listing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Branston described himself as a "non-practising" Jew, and was the town's second Jewish mayor—coincidentally following on from the first Jewish mayor of the town. Talking about a visit to a local school arranged by the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]], he said:

:''Bedford Modern gave room for a travelling exhibition at the request of the Board of Deputies of British Jews and asked me to open it. I am sure they were not aware that I am Jewish (non-practising). I pointed out that while Bedford is certainly one of the oldest boroughs in the country, having been chartered in 1166, it had to wait a long time before getting its first Jewish mayor, Cllr Judith Cunningham in 2002. I succeeded her. Isn’t that always the way? You wait 836 years for a Jewish Mayor then two come along at once.''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frankbranston.co.uk/wordpress/?p=55 Frank Branston's blog – It was all absolutely Kosher] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826191826/http://frankbranston.co.uk/wordpress/?p=55 |date=26 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Frank Branston stood as an independent in the borough's first direct election for mayor in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2339617.stm BBC News – Bedford goes for Branston]&lt;/ref&gt; backed at the time by the Better Bedford Independent Party, which has since announced that it will field no further candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedsonsunday.com/bedsonsunday-news/DisplayArticle.asp?id=81256 Party's over for Better Bedford] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825020651/http://www.bedsonsunday.com/bedsonsunday-news/DisplayArticle.asp?id=81256 |date=25 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His platform was based on encouraging investment in the town and on focussing on getting things done rather than on party politics (the borough and the county both had a history of hung councils and unimplemented development plans over several decades).

Branston was re-elected with an increased majority on Thursday 3 May 2007, after a count which lasted 16 hours due to problems with an experimental electronic counting system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dynamoo.com/diary/bedford-elections-2007.htm Bedford Elections 2007 and the electronic counting fiasco]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In July 2009, he suffered an [[aortic aneurysm]] and underwent emergency surgery at [[Papworth Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090825020623/http://www.bedsonsunday.com/bedsonsunday%2Dnews/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=438204 Bedford Today – Mayor in hospital fight for his life]&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 14 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedfordtoday.co.uk/bed-news/Mayor-Frank-Branston-dies.5556406.jp Bedford Today – Mayor Frank Branston dies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/8202286.stm BBC News –  Mayor dies after heart operation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/News/Mayor-of-Bedford-dies.htm Bedfordshire on Sunday – Mayor of Bedford dies]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, a new section of the [[A428]] trunk road bypassing the west of Bedford was named The Branston Way in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedfordtoday.co.uk/bed-news/Branston-Way-opens-at-last.5882083.jp Bedford Today – Branston Way opens at last]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Harbinger of Apocalypse''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appears in ''[[Cable (comic book)|Cable]]'' #50, and was created by writer [[James Robinson (comics)|James Robinson]] and artist [[José Ladrönn]].

==Fictional character biography==
In 1859, the immortal [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] during his time in [[London]]  decided that he would need a superpowered agent in the 20th century and imprisoned an unnamed human in a special coffin.  Inside the coffin, this man would be transformed by Apocalypse's [[Celestials|Celestial]] technology into the Harbinger of Apocalypse.{{issue|date=May 2013}}

In the late 20th century, the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] found out about the existence of the Harbinger and intended to use it to track down Apocalypse for the Hellfire Club's exploitation.  [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] tried to stop the Hellfire Club, but he was too late and the Harbinger awoke.  The Harbinger defeated the Hellfire Club and disappeared, but Cable tracked him down.  The Harbinger told Cable that his programming dictated that he should bring destruction and chaos to the world, but he wanted to judge humanity himself before obeying.{{issue|date=May 2013}}

Some time later, the Harbinger reappeared in [[Manhattan]] and decided that humanity should be destroyed.  Cable and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] battled the Harbinger, but he adapted to all of their attacks.  In the end, Apocalypse activated a bomb inside the Harbinger which would destroy New York.  Cable managed to prevent the destruction of New York by wearing [[Iron Man]]'s flight boots and grabbing the Harbinger.  The bomb exploded over the [[Atlantic Ocean]], killing the Harbinger, but Cable was saved by a group of time travellers.{{issue|date=May 2013}}

==Powers and abilities==
The Harbinger had the ability to adapt to any attack used against him.  During his fight with the Avengers and Cable, he showed superhuman strength and durability, the ability to fly, teleport and project destructive energy from his body.  The Harbinger also had a bomb inside him which was powerful enough to destroy him and a large city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24128">In mathematics, '''infinite [[composition (mathematics)|compositions]] of [[analytic function]]s (ICAF)''' offer alternative formulations of [[Generalized continued fraction|analytic continued fractions]], [[series (mathematics)|series]], [[product (mathematics)|products]] and other infinite expansions, and the theory evolving from such compositions may shed light on the [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence/divergence]] of these expansions. Some functions can actually be expanded directly as infinite compositions. In addition, it is possible to use ICAF to evaluate solutions of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] equations involving infinite expansions. [[Complex dynamics]] offers another venue for [[iterated function system|iteration of systems of functions]] rather than a single function. For infinite compositions of a ''single function'' see [[Iterated function]]. For compositions of a finite number of functions, useful in [[fractal]] theory, see [[Iterated function system]]. 

Although the title of this article specifies analytic functions, there are results for more general [[Complex analysis|functions of a complex variable]] as well.


==Notation==
There are several notations describing infinite compositions, including the following:

'''Forward compositions:''' {{math|''F&lt;sub&gt;k,n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') {{=}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∘ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ... ∘ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'').}}

'''Backward compositions:''' {{math|''G&lt;sub&gt;k,n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') {{=}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∘ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ... ∘ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'')}}

In each case convergence is interpreted as the existence of the following limits:

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n\to \infty} F_{1,n}(z), \qquad \lim_{n\to\infty} G_{1,n}(z).&lt;/math&gt;

For convenience, set {{math|''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') {{=}} ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1,''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'')}} and {{math|''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') {{=}} ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1,''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'')}}.

One may also write &lt;math&gt;F_n(z)=\underset{k=1}{\overset{n}{\mathop R}}\,f_k(z)=f_1 \circ f_2\circ \cdots \circ f_n(z)&lt;/math&gt;  and
&lt;math&gt;G_n(z)=\underset{k=1}{\overset{n}{\mathop L}}\,g_k(z)=g_n \circ g_{n-1}\circ \cdots \circ g_1(z)&lt;/math&gt;

==Contraction theorem==
Many results can be considered extensions of the following result:

:'''Contraction Theorem for Analytic Functions.'''&lt;ref&gt;P. Henrici, ''Applied and Computational Complex Analysis'', Vol. 1 (Wiley, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''f'' be analytic in a simply-connected region ''S'' and continuous on the closure {{overline|''S''}} of ''S''. Suppose ''f''({{overline|''S''}}) is a bounded set contained in ''S''. Then for all ''z'' in {{overline|''S''}} there exists an [[Fixed point (mathematics)#Attractive fixed points|attractive fixed point]] α of ''f'' in ''S'' such that:
::&lt;math&gt;F_n(z)=(f\circ f\circ \cdots \circ f)(z)\to \alpha,&lt;/math&gt;

==Infinite compositions of contractive functions==
Let {''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} be a sequence of functions analytic on a simply-connected domain ''S''. Suppose there exists a compact set Ω ⊂ ''S'' such that for each ''n'', ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''S'') ⊂ Ω.

:'''Forward (inner or right) Compositions Theorem.''' {''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} converges uniformly on compact subsets of ''S'' to a constant function ''F''(''z'') = λ.&lt;ref&gt;L. Lorentzen, Compositions of contractions, J. Comp &amp; Appl Math. 32 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Backward (outer or left) Compositions Theorem.''' {''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} converges uniformly on compact subsets of ''S'' to γ ∈ Ω if and only if the sequence of fixed points {''γ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} of the {''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} converges to ''γ''.&lt;ref name = Gilla&gt;J. Gill, The use of the sequence {{math|''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') {{=}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∘ ... ∘ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'')}} in computing the fixed points of continued fractions, products, and series, Appl. Numer. Math. 8 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional theory resulting from investigations based on these two theorems, particularly Forward Compositions Theorem, include location analysis for the limits obtained here [http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/keenl/blochconstantsfinalversion.pdf]. For a different approach to Backward Compositions Theorem, see [http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/keenl/forwarditer.pdf].

Regarding Backward Compositions Theorem, the example ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') = 1/2 and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') = −1/2 for ''S'' = {''z'' : |''z''| &lt; 1} demonstrates the inadequacy of simply requiring contraction into a compact subset, like Forward Compositions Theorem.

For functions not necessarily analytic the [[Contraction mapping|Lipschitz]] condition suffices:

:'''Theorem.'''&lt;ref name=Gill&gt;J. Gill, A Primer on the Elementary Theory of Infinite Compositions of Complex Functions, Comm. Anal. Th. Cont. Frac., Vol XXIII (2017) and researchgate.net&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a simply connected compact subset of &lt;math&gt;\C&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;t_n : S \to S&lt;/math&gt; be a family of functions that satisfies 
::&lt;math&gt; \forall n, \forall z_1, z_2 \in S, \exists \rho: \quad \left|t_n(z_1)-t_n(z_2) \right|\le \rho |z_1-z_2|, \quad \rho &lt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;
:Define:
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
G_n(z) &amp;= \left (t_n\circ t_{n-1}\circ \cdots \circ t_1 \right ) (z) \\
 F_n(z) &amp;= \left (t_1 \circ t_2\circ \cdots \circ t_n \right ) (z)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:Then  &lt;math&gt;F_n(z)\to \beta \in S&lt;/math&gt; uniformly on &lt;math&gt;S.&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;\alpha_n&lt;/math&gt; is the unique fixed point of &lt;math&gt;t_n&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;G_n(z)\to \alpha &lt;/math&gt; uniformly on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;|\alpha_n -\alpha|=\varepsilon_n \to 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Infinite compositions of other functions==

=== Non-contractive complex functions ===
Results&lt;ref name=Gillb /&gt; involving '''[[entire function]]s''' include the following, as examples. Set

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_n(z)&amp;=a_n z + c_{n,2}z^2+c_{n,3} z^3+\cdots \\
\rho_n &amp;= \sup_r \left\{ \left| c_{n,r} \right|^{\frac{1}{r-1}} \right\}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Then the following results hold:

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:Then ''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') → ''G''(''z''), analytic for |''z''| &lt; ''R''. Convergence is uniform on compact subsets of {''z'' : |''z''| &lt; ''R''}.

Results&lt;ref name=Gillb /&gt; for compositions of '''[[möbius transformation|linear fractional (Möbius) transformations]]''' include the following, as examples:

:'''Theorem LFT1.'''  On the set of convergence of a sequence {''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} of non-singular LFTs, the limit function is either:

In (a), the sequence converges everywhere in the extended plane.

Case (c) can occur with every possible set of convergence.&lt;ref&gt;G. Piranian &amp; W. Thron,Convergence properties of sequences of Linear fractional transformations, Mich. Math.

==Examples and applications==

=== Continued fractions ===
The value of the infinite continued fraction

:&lt;math&gt;\cfrac{a_1}{b_1+\cfrac{a_2}{b_2+\cdots}}&lt;/math&gt;

may be expressed as the limit of the sequence {''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(0)} where

:&lt;math&gt;f_n(z)=\frac{a_n}{b_n+z}.&lt;/math&gt;

As a simple example, a well-known result (Worpitsky Circle*&lt;ref&gt;L. Lorentzen, H. Waadeland, ''Continued Fractions with Applications'', North Holland (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;) follows from an application of Theorem (A):

Consider the continued fraction

:&lt;math&gt;\cfrac{a_1\zeta }{1+\cfrac{a_2\zeta }{1+\cdots}} &lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;f_n(z)=\frac{a_n \zeta }{1+z}.&lt;/math&gt;

Stipulate that |ζ| &lt; 1 and |''z''| &lt; ''R'' &lt; 1.  Then for 0 &lt; ''r'' &lt; 1,

: &lt;math&gt;|a_n|&lt;rR(1-R)\Rightarrow \left|f_n(z) \right|&lt;rR&lt;R\Rightarrow \frac{a_1\zeta }{1+\frac{a_2\zeta }{1+\cdots}} = F(\zeta )&lt;/math&gt;, analytic for |''z''| &lt; 1. Set ''R'' = 1/2.

'''Example.''' &lt;math&gt;F(z)=\frac{(i-1)z}{1+i+z\text{   }+}\text{  }\frac{(2-i)z}{1+2i+z\text{   }+}\text{  }\frac{(3-i)z}{1+3i+z\text{   }+} \cdots, &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;[-15,15]&lt;/math&gt;

=== Direct functional expansion ===
Examples illustrating the conversion of a function directly into a composition follow:

'''Example 1.'''&lt;ref name=Kojima /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Steinmetz, ''Rational Iteration'', Walter de Gruyter, Berlin (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is an entire function satisfying the following conditions:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} \phi (tz)=t\left( \phi (z)+\phi (z)^2 \right) &amp; |t|&gt; 1 \\ \phi(0) = 0 \\ \phi'(0) =1 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
Then 
:&lt;math&gt;f_n(z)=z+\frac{z^2}{t^n}\Longrightarrow F_n(z)\to \phi (z)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example 2.'''&lt;ref name=Kojima /&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;f_n(z)=z+\frac{z^2}{2^n}\Longrightarrow F_n(z)\to \frac{1}{2}\left( e^{2z}-1 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example 3.'''&lt;ref name=Gillb /&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;f_n(z)= \frac{z}{1-\tfrac{z^2}{4^n}}\Longrightarrow F_n(z)\to \tan (z)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example 4.'''&lt;ref name=Gillb /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g_n(z)=\frac{2 \cdot 4^{n}}{z} \left ( \sqrt{1+\frac{z^2}{4^{n}}}-1 \right )\Longrightarrow G_n(z) \to \arctan (z)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Calculation of fixed-points ===
Theorem (B) can be applied to determine the fixed-points of functions defined by infinite expansions or certain integrals. The following examples illustrate the process:

'''Example FP1.'''&lt;ref name=Gilla /&gt; For |ζ| ≤ 1 let

:&lt;math&gt;G(\zeta )=\frac{ \tfrac{e^\zeta}{4}}{3+\zeta +\cfrac{\tfrac{e^\zeta} 8 }{3+\zeta + \cfrac{\tfrac{e^\zeta}{12}}{3+\zeta +\cdots}}}&lt;/math&gt;

To find α = ''G''(α), first we define:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
t_n(z)&amp;=\cfrac{\tfrac{e^\zeta}{4n}}{3+\zeta +z} \\
f_n(\zeta )&amp;= t_1\circ t_2\circ \cdots \circ t_n(0)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Then calculate &lt;math&gt;G_n(\zeta )=f_n\circ \cdots \circ f_1(\zeta )&lt;/math&gt; with ζ = 1, which gives: α = 0.087118118... to ten decimal places after ten iterations.

:'''Theorem FP2.'''&lt;ref name=Gillb /&gt; Let φ(ζ, ''t'') be analytic in ''S'' = {''z'' : |''z''| &lt; ''R''} for all ''t'' in [0, 1] and continuous in ''t''. Set
::&lt;math&gt;f_n (\zeta)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \varphi \left( \zeta ,\tfrac{k}{n} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
:If |φ(ζ, ''t'')| ≤ ''r'' &lt; ''R'' for ζ ∈ ''S'' and ''t'' ∈ [0, 1], then
::&lt;math&gt;\zeta =\int_0^1 \varphi (\zeta ,t) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;
:has a unique solution, α in ''S'', with &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to \infty} G_n(\zeta ) = \alpha. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Evolution functions ===
Consider a time interval, normalized to ''I'' = [0, 1]. ICAFs can be constructed to describe continuous motion of a point, ''z'', over the interval, but in such a way that at each "instant" the motion is virtually zero (see [[Zeno's paradoxes|Zeno's Arrow]]): For the interval divided into n equal subintervals, 1 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n'' set &lt;math&gt;g_{k,n}(z)=z+\varphi_{k,n}(z)&lt;/math&gt; analytic or simply continuous – in a domain ''S'', such that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to \infty}\varphi_{k,n}(z)=0&lt;/math&gt; for all ''k'' and all ''z'' in ''S'', 
and &lt;math&gt;g_{k,n}(z)\in S&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Principal example&lt;ref name=Gillb /&gt; ====

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
g_{k,n}(z) &amp;=z+\frac{1}{n}\phi  \left (z,\tfrac{k}{n} \right ) \\
G_{k,n}(z) &amp;= \left (g_{k,n}\circ g_{k-1,n} \circ \cdots \circ g_{1,n} \right ) (z) \\ 
G_n(z) &amp;=G_{n,n}(z)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

implies

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_n(z)\doteq G_n(z)-z=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n \phi  \left( G_{k-1,n}(z)\tfrac k n \right)\doteq \frac 1 n \sum_{k=1}^n \psi \left (z,\tfrac{k}{n} \right) \sim \int_0^1 \psi (z,t)\,dt,&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is well-defined if &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dz}{dt}=\phi  (z,t)&lt;/math&gt; has a closed-form solution ''z''(''t'').  Then

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_n(z_0)\approx \int_0^1 \phi ( z(t),t)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

Otherwise, the integrand is poorly defined although the value of the integral is easily computed. In this case one might call the integral a "virtual" integral.

'''Example.''' &lt;math&gt;\phi  (z,t)=\frac{2t-\cos y}{1-\sin x\cos y}+i\frac{1-2t\sin x}{1-\sin x\cos y}, \int_0^1 \psi (z,t) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example.'''&lt;ref&gt;J. Gill, Informal Notes: Zeno contours, parametric forms, &amp; integrals, Comm. Anal. Th. Cont. Frac., Vol XX (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Let:

:&lt;math&gt;g_n(z)=z+\frac{c_n}{n}\phi  (z), \quad \text{with} \quad f(z) = z + \phi(z).&lt;/math&gt;

Next, set &lt;math&gt;T_{1,n}(z)=g_n(z), T_{k,n}(z)= g_n(T_{k-1,n}(z)),&lt;/math&gt; and ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') = ''T&lt;sub&gt;n,n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z''). Let

:&lt;math&gt;T(z)=\lim_{n\to \infty} T_n(z)&lt;/math&gt;

when that limit exists. The sequence {''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'')} defines contours γ = γ(''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''z'') that follow the flow of the vector field ''f''(''z''). If there exists an attractive fixed point α, meaning |''f''(''z'') − α| ≤ ρ|''z'' − α| for 0 ≤ ρ &lt; 1, then ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') → ''T''(''z'') ≡ α along γ = γ(''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''z''), provided (for example) &lt;math&gt;c_n = \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;. If ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≡ ''c'' &gt; 0, then ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') → ''T''(''z''), a point on the contour γ = γ(''c'', ''z''). It is easily seen that

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_\gamma \phi  (\zeta ) \, d\zeta =\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac c n \sum_{k=1}^n \phi ^2 \left (T_{k-1,n}(z) \right )&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;L(\gamma (z))=\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{c}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n \left| \phi  \left (T_{k-1,n}(z) \right ) \right|, &lt;/math&gt;

when these limits exist.

These concepts are marginally related to ''[[Active contour model|active contour theory]]'' in image processing, and are simple generalizations of the [[Euler method]]

The series defined recursively by ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') = ''z'' + ''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') have the property that the nth term is predicated on the sum of the first ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 terms. In order to employ theorem (GF3) it is necessary to show boundedness in the following sense: If each ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined for |''z''| &lt; ''M'' then |''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'')| &lt; ''M'' must follow before |''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''z''| =&amp;nbsp;|''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'')| ≤&amp;nbsp;''Cβ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined for iterative purposes. This is because &lt;math&gt;g_n(G_{n-1}(z))&lt;/math&gt; occurs throughout the expansion. The restriction

:&lt;math&gt;|z|&lt;R=M-C\sum_{k=1}^\infty \beta_k &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

serves this purpose. Then ''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') → ''G''(''z'') uniformly on the restricted domain.

'''Example (S1).'''   Set 
:&lt;math&gt;f_n(z)=z+\frac{1}{\rho n^2}\sqrt{z}, \qquad \rho &gt;\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{6}}&lt;/math&gt; 
and ''M'' = ρ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Then ''R'' = ρ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − (π/6) &gt; 0. Then, if &lt;math&gt;S=\left\{ z: |z|&lt;R,\operatorname{Re}(z)&gt;0 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;, ''z'' in ''S'' implies |''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'')| &lt; ''M'' and theorem (GF3) applies, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
G_n(z) &amp;=z+g_1(z)+g_2(G_1(z))+g_3(G_2(z))+\cdots + g_n(G_{n-1}(z)) \\ 
&amp;= z+\frac{1}{\rho \cdot 1^2}\sqrt{z}+\frac{1}{\rho \cdot 2^2}\sqrt{G_1(z)}+\frac{1}{\rho \cdot 3^2}\sqrt{G_2(z)}+\cdots +\frac{1}{\rho \cdot n^2} \sqrt{G_{n-1}(z)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

converges absolutely, hence is convergent.

'''Example (S2)''':   &lt;math&gt;f_n(z)=z+\frac 1 {n^2}\cdot \varphi (z), \varphi (z)=2\cos(x/y)+i2\sin (x/y), &gt;G_n(z)=f_n \circ f_{n-1}\circ \cdots \circ f_1(z), \qquad [-10,10], n=50 &lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Self-generating series3.jpg|thumb|center|325px|Example (S2)- A topographical (moduli) image of a self generating series.]]

====Products====
The product defined recursively by

:&lt;math&gt;f_n(z)=z( 1+g_n(z)), \qquad |z| \leqslant M,&lt;/math&gt;

has the appearance

:&lt;math&gt;G_n(z) = z \prod _{k=1}^n \left( 1+g_k \left( G_{k-1}(z) \right) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

In order to apply Theorem GF3 it is required that:

:&lt;math&gt;\left| zg_n(z) \right|\le C\beta_n, \qquad \sum_{k=1}^\infty \beta_k&lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Once again, a boundedness condition must support

:&lt;math&gt;\left|G_{n-1}(z) g_n(G_{n-1}(z))\right|\le C \beta_n.&lt;/math&gt;

If one knows ''Cβ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' in advance, the following will suffice:

:&lt;math&gt;|z| \leqslant R = \frac{M}{P} \qquad \text{where} \quad P = \prod_{n=1}^\infty \left( 1+C\beta_n\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Then ''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') → ''G''(''z'') uniformly on the restricted domain.

'''Example (P1).'''  Suppose &lt;math&gt;f_n(z)=z(1+g_n(z))&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;g_n(z)=\tfrac{z^2}{n^3},&lt;/math&gt; observing after a few preliminary computations, that |''z''| ≤ 1/4 implies |''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'')| &lt; 0.27. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\left|G_n(z)  \frac{G_n(z)^2}{n^3} \right|&lt;(0.02)\frac{1}{n^3}=C\beta_n&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;G_n(z)=z \prod_{k=1}^{n-1}\left( 1+\frac{G_k(z)^2}{n^3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

converges uniformly.

'''Example (P2).'''

:&lt;math&gt;g_{k,n}(z)=z\left( 1+\frac 1 n \varphi \left (z,\tfrac k n \right ) \right),&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;G_{n,n}(z)= \left ( g_{n,n}\circ g_{n-1,n}\circ \cdots \circ g_{1,n} \right ) (z) = z\prod_{k=1}^n ( 1+P_{k,n}(z)),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{k,n}(z)=\frac 1 n \varphi \left (G_{k-1,n}(z),\tfrac{k}{n} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \left( 1+P_{k,n}(z) \right) = 1+P_{1,n}(z)+{{P}_{2,n}}(z)+\cdots +{{P}_{k-1,n}}(z) + R_n(z) \sim \int_0^1 \pi (z,t) \, dt + 1+R_n(z),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi (z)=x\cos(y)+i\cdot y\sin(x), \int_0^1 (z\pi (z,t)-1) \,dt, \qquad [-15,15]: &lt;/math&gt;

'''Ioannis Metaxas''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|t|ə|k|ˌ|s|æ|s}};&lt;ref&gt;[[Benaki Museum]], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stCjxgGx87Y "Greek history - The dictatorship of Ioannis Metaxas and the start of World War II 1936 – 1940"]&lt;!--at 0:33--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-el|Ιωάννης Μεταξάς}}; 12 April 1871{{Greece Old Style dating}} – 29 January 1941) was a [[Greece|Greek]] military officer and politician, serving as [[Prime Minister of Greece]] from 1936 until his death in 1941. He governed constitutionally for the first four months of his tenure, and thereafter as the strongman of the authoritarian [[4th of August Regime]]. On 28 October 1940, he denied an ultimatum imposed by the Italians to surrender Greece to the [[Axis powers]], thus bringing Greece into [[World War II]].

==Military career==
[[File:Ioannis Metaxas with parents.jpg|thumb|left|160px|As a child with his parents]]
Ioannis Metaxas was born in [[Ithaca]] in 1871.{{sfn|Συνοπτική Ιστορία του ΓΕΣ, 2001|p=140}} His family was inscribed in the ''[[Libro d'Oro]]'' of the Ionian islands&lt;ref&gt;Ευγενίου Ρίζου Ραγκαβή, Livre d' Or de la noblesse ionienne, Vol. 2 - Cephalonie, Αθήναι 1926, Ελευθερουδάκης&lt;/ref&gt;, previously a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] possession, while its roots originated in the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] nobility. 

Following studies at the [[Hellenic Military Academy]], he became a career military officer, being sworn as an Engineers 2nd Lieutenant on 10 August 1890.{{sfn|Συνοπτική Ιστορία του ΓΕΣ, 2001|p=140}} He first saw action in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]] attached to the staff of the Greek commander-in-chief, Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Συνοπτική Ιστορία του ΓΕΣ, 2001|p=140}} 

After the war he continued his military studies in the Berlin War Academy in 1899–1903. On his return in 1904 he joined the newly formed General Staff Corps.{{sfn|Συνοπτική Ιστορία του ΓΕΣ, 2001|p=140}} He was part of the modernizing process of the Greek Army before the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912-13). However he opposed the [[Goudi coup]]. 

===Balkan Wars===
[[File:Greek GHQ at Hadji-Beylik.jpg|thumb|240px|Greek lithograph during the Balkan Wars depicting Metaxas (at the back of the table) with King Constantine, PM Venizelos and other officers at the HQs of the Army]]
In 1910 he was appointed by [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], who had also assumed the post of [[Minister of Military Affairs (Greece)|Minister of Military Affairs]], as his adjutant.{{sfn|Συνοπτική Ιστορία του ΓΕΣ, 2001|p=140}} In 1912, just before the Balkan Wars, Venizelos appointed Metaxas to negotiate the military treaty between Greece and Bulgaria, sending him to [[Sofia]].{{sfn|Συνοπτική Ιστορία του ΓΕΣ, 2001|p=140}} He participated in the [[First Balkan War]] as a Captain in the operations staff of the [[Army of Thessaly]], before joining Venizelos as a military export in the [[London Conference of 1912–13]] in December 1912.{{sfn|Συνοπτική Ιστορία του ΓΕΣ, 2001|p=140}} In May 1913, as military plenipotentiary, he negotiated the military terms of the [[Greek–Serbian Alliance of 1913|Greek–Serbian Alliance]].{{sfn|Συνοπτική Ιστορία του ΓΕΣ, 2001|p=140}} He took part in the [[Second Balkan War]] when he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. 

After the end of the Balkan Wars, he was appointed director of the 1st (Operations) Directorate of the [[Hellenic Army General Staff|Army Staff Service]], and became deputy head of the Staff Service in January 1915.{{sfn|Συνοπτική Ιστορία του ΓΕΣ, 2001|p=140}} In October 1913, he was awarded by the King with the [[Order of the Redeemer|Golden Cross of the Redeemer]]. 

===Greco-Turkish crisis of 1914===
In the spring and summer of 1914, Greece found itself in a confrontation with the Ottoman Empire over the status of the eastern Aegean islands, which had been occupied by Greece in the First Balkan War, and were finally awarded to Greece on 31 January 1914 by the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|pp=4–6}} The Ottomans refused to accept this, leading to a naval arms race broke out between the two countries and persecutions of the Greeks in Asia Minor. On 29 May, the Greek government issued an official protest to the [[Sublime Porte]], threatening a breach of relations and even war, if the persecutions were not stopped.{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|pp=6–8}} On 6 June 1914, Metaxas, as the ''de facto'' head of the Staff Service, presented a study on the military options against Turkey: the only truly decisive manoeuvre, a landing of the entire Greek army in Asia Minor, was impossible due to the hostility of Bulgaria; instead, Metaxas proposed the sudden occupation of the [[Gallipoli Peninsula]], without a prior [[declaration of war]], the clearing of the [[Dardanelles]], and the occupation of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] so as to force the Ottomans to negotiate.{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|pp=8–9}} However, on the previous day, the Ottoman government had suggested mutual talks, and the tension eased enough for Prime Minister Venizelos and the Ottoman [[Grand Vizier]], [[Said Halim Pasha]], to meet in [[Brussels]] in July.{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|p=8}}

===World War I and the National Schism===
{{Main|National Schism}}
Following the [[outbreak of World War I]], the prospect of Greece's possible entry into the war emerged, especially given the obligation to provide military assistance to Serbia based on the Greek–Serbian Alliance. Already on 12 July 1914, the Serbian government had requested Greece's aid by the terms of the alliance, in the case of an Austrian and Bulgarian attack. Greece rejected the request on the grounds that Serbia had undertaken to provide 150,000 troops in the area of [[Gevgelija]] to guard against a Bulgarian attack; in addition, if Greece sent her army to fight the Austrians along the Danube, this would only incite a Bulgarian attack against both countries, with insufficient forces left to oppose it.{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|pp=6, 17}}

====Clash with Venizelos over Greece's entry in the war====
A German request on 14 July to join the [[Central Powers]] was rejected by both Venizelos and King Constantine,{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|p=17}} but on 1 August, Venizelos sounded out the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], Britain, France, and Russia. The Allied governments were lukewarm to Venizelos' proposals, since they hoped to entice Bulgaria on their side, even offering territorial concessions at the expense of Serbia, Greece, and Romania. Russia in particular considered her interests best served if Greece remained neutral.{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|p=18}} On 19 November, Serbia repeated its request for Greek assistance, supported by the Allies. Venizelos asked Metaxas for an evaluation of the situation; the opinion of the latter was that without a simultaneous entry of Romania into the war on the side of the Allies, Greece's position was too risky. Following the firm refusal of Romania to be drawn into the conflict at this time, the proposal was scuttled.{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|pp=18–19}} 

On 11 January 1915, the British offered Greece "significant territorial concessions in Asia Minor" if it would enter the war to support Serbia, and in exchange for satisfying some of the Bulgarian territorial demands in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] ([[Kavala]], [[Drama, Greece|Drama]], and [[Chrysoupolis]]) in exchange for Bulgarian entry into the war on the side of the Entente.{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|p=20}} Venizelos argued in favour of the proposal, but again the opinion of Metaxas was negative, for reasons which he laid down in a memorandum on 20 January: the Austrians were likely to defeat the Serbian army before a Greek mobilization could be completed, Bulgaria was likely to flank any Greek forces fighting against the Austrians, while a Romanian intervention would not be decisive. Metaxas judged that even if Bulgaria joined the Allies, it still would not suffice to shift the balance in Central Europe, and recommended the presence of four Allied army corps in Macedonia as the minimum necessary force for any substantial aid to the Greeks and Serbs. Furthermore, Metaxas argued that a Greek entry into the war would once again expose the Greeks of Asia Minor to Turkish reprisals.{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|pp=20–21}} Venizelos rejected this report, and recommended entry into the war in a memorandum to the King, provided that Bulgaria and Romania also joined the Entente. By that time, however, it was clear that Bulgaria was edging towards the Central Powers, and Romania's determination to remain neutral led the Greek government to again refuse.{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|pp=21–23}} 

However, in February 1915, the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Allied attack on Gallipoli]] began.{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|pp=20–26}} Venizelos decided to offer an army corps and the entire Greek fleet to assist the Allies, making an official offer on 16 February, despite the King's reservations. This caused Metaxas to resign on the next day in protest, basing his argument on the loss of the element of surprise, the fortification of the straits, the fact that a single army corps was insufficient to alter the balance of forces, and the uncertain and opportunistic stance of Bulgaria. Metaxas insisted that the campaign had been mishandled thus far, and that even if the Allies captured Gallipoli, the Ottomans still fielded 12 divisions in [[Eastern Thrace]].{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|pp=26–27}} Shaken by Metaxas' resignation, Venizelos convened meetings of the Crown Council (the King, Venizelos, and the living former prime ministers) on 18 and 20 February, but they proved indecisive. King Constantine decided to keep the country neutral, whereupon Venizelos submitted his resignation on 21 February 1915.{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|pp=26–29}} 

Venizelos won the [[Greek legislative election, May 1915|May 1915 elections]], and formed a new government on 17 August.{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|pp=41–42}} When Bulgaria signed a [[Bulgaria–Germany treaty (1915)|treaty of alliance]] with Germany and [[Mobilization of the Bulgarian Army in 1915|mobilized against Serbia]], Venizelos ordered a Greek counter-mobilization (10 September 1916).{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|pp=42–43}} As part of the mobilization, Metaxas was recalled to active duty as deputy chief of staff.{{sfn|Συνοπτική Ιστορία του ΓΕΣ, 2001|p=140}} After Venizelos condoned the landing of British and French troops in [[Thessaloniki]] to aid the collapsing Serbian army,{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|pp=45–49}} Venizelos presented his case for participation in the war to Parliament, securing 152 votes in favour to 102 against in a dramatic vote in the early hours 22 September. On the next day, however, King Constantine dismissed Venizelos, and called upon [[Alexandros Zaimis]] to form a government.{{sfn|Επίτομη ιστορία συμμετοχής στον Α′ Π.Π., 1993|p=49}}

===="National Schism" and the "Reservists"====
This dismissal solidified the rift between monarchists and Venizelists, creating the "[[National Schism]]" or National Divide that would plague Greek politics for decades. During the National Schism, Metaxas clearly advocated the preservation of neutrality{{cn|date=April 2018}}, believing also that the Central Powers would win the war.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In May and August 1916, Constantine and the General Staff allowed the [[Fort Roupel]] and parts of eastern Macedonia to be occupied, without opposition, by the Central Powers. This caused popular anger.&lt;ref name=clogg&gt;Richard Clogg, A Concise History of Greece, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1916, Venizelist officers launched a revolt in Greece's northern city of [[Thessaloniki]], which resulted in the establishment of a separate "[[Movement of National Defence|Government of National Defence]]" under Venizelos. The new government, with the Allied support, expanded its control over half the country and entered the war on the Allies' side.

Meanwhile, the official Greek state and the royal government remained neutral. King Constantine and Metaxas were accused as pro-German by their Venizelist opponents. Metaxas was later head of the pro-royal forces and creator of the paramilitary "[[Epistratoi|Reservists]]" forces during the [[Noemvriana]] events in Athens.

In June 1917, under Allied pressure, King Constantine finally was deposed, [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] became King and Venizelos came to power, declaring war officially on behalf of the whole country on 29 June 1917.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

===Exile and Interwar political career===
Metaxas followed the King into exile in [[Corsica]] and later found himself with his family to [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Έγγραφο Α. Ράμμου, Γενικά Αρχεία του Κράτους, Αρχείο Ι. Μεταξά, Φακ. 53, όπως αναφέρεται στο Πετρίδης Παύλος, ''Σύγχρονη Ελληνική Πολιτική Ιστορία'', Γκοβόστης, 2000, {{ISBN|960-270-858-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Λεύκωμα των υπό την αιγίδα της Μεγάλης Στοάς της Ελλάδος Τεκτονικών Στοών, Αθήνα 1998, σελ.47&lt;/ref&gt; 

He returned to Greece in November 1920, after the [[Greek legislative election, 1920|electoral defeat]] of Eleftherios Venizelos. He was reinstated in the army with the rank of Major General, but as he opposed the continued [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greek campaign in Asia Minor]], he resigned and went into retirement on 28 December 1920.{{sfn|Συνοπτική Ιστορία του ΓΕΣ, 2001|p=140}} He subsequently repeatedly rejected the military leadership of the Greek army. Following the defeat of Greek forces in Asia Minor, King Constantine was again forced into exile by the [[11 September 1922 Revolution]], this time led by Col. [[Nikolaos Plastiras]]. Metaxas moved into politics and founded the [[Freethinkers' Party]] on 12 October 1922.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

However, his association with the failed royalist [[Leonardopoulos-Gargalidis coup attempt]] in October 1923 forced him to flee again the country. Soon after, King [[George II of Greece|George II]] (son of Constantine I) was also forced into exile. The monarchy was abolished, and the [[Second Hellenic Republic]] was proclaimed, in March 1924.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Metaxas returned to Greece soon after, publicly stating his acceptance of the Republic regime. Despite a promising start, and his status as one of the most prominent royalist politicians, Metaxas' foray into politics was not very successful. In the [[Greek legislative election, 1926|1926 elections]], his Freethinkers' Party claimed 15.78% of the vote and 52 seats in Parliament, putting it almost on a par with the other main royalist party, the [[People's Party (Greece)|People's Party]]. As a result, Metaxas became Communications Minister in the "[[ecumenical government]]" formed under [[Alexandros Zaimis]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

However, infighting within the party and the departure of many members plunged the party to 5.3% and a single seat in the [[Greek legislative election, 1928|1928 elections]]. The [[Greek legislative election, 1932|1932]] and [[Greek legislative election, 1933|1933 elections]] saw the percentage drop to 1.59%, although the party still returned three MPs, and Metaxas became Interior Minister in the [[Panagis Tsaldaris]] cabinet. In the [[Greek legislative election, 1935|1935 elections]], he cooperated in a union with other small royalist parties, returning seven MPs, repeating the performance in the [[Greek legislative election, 1936|1936 elections]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

After a heavily rigged plebiscite, George II returned to take the throne in 1935. After the elections on 26 January 1936, Venizelists and anti-Venizelists could not form a government mainly on the question of the return of the democratic officers of the 1935 movement to the army. 

In a series of initiatives, King George II was able to play a decisive role in shaping the political scene. On March 5, George II appointed Metaxas the Minister of Defence, a post in which he would remain until his death in 1941. The political significance of this appointment was great since Metaxas was not only a dedicated royalist but one of the few politicians who had supported openly the imposition of an authoritarian, non-parliamentary regime in Greece. 

On 14 March, the Demertzis government was sworn in, and Ioannis Metaxas was appointed Vice-President of the government and Minister of Defence. Demetzis died suddenly on 13 April. That same day, the king appointed Metaxas Prime Minister. Following a failure by the Liberals (Venizelists) to come to an agreement with the anti-Venizelist parties, the Metaxas government secured a vote of confidence from the House of Parliament on 27 April with 241 votes in favor, 4 abstentions and 16 against. Three days later, the House of Parliament resolved and suspended its work for five months, authorizing the government to issue legislative decrees on all matters, with the agreement of a parliamentary committee which never operated.

Widespread industrial unrest gave Metaxas justification to declare a [[state of emergency]] on 4 August 1936 with the excuse of the "communist danger". With the King's support, he adjourned parliament indefinitely and suspended various articles of the constitution guaranteeing civil liberties. In a national radio address, Metaxas declared that for the duration of the state of emergency, he would hold "all the power I need for saving Greece from the catastrophes which threaten her." The regime created as a result of this [[self-coup]] became known as the "[[4th of August Regime]]" after the date of its proclamation.

The regime's propaganda presented Metaxas as "the First Peasant", "the First Worker" and "the National Father" of the Greeks. Metaxas adopted the title of ''Arkhigos'', Greek for "leader" or "chieftain", and claimed a "Third Hellenic Civilization", following [[ancient Greece]] and the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]] of the Middle Ages. State propaganda portrayed Metaxas as a "Saviour of the Nation", bringing unity to a divided country.&lt;ref name="petrakis39"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Petrakis|first=Marina|title=The Metaxas myth: dictatorship and propaganda in Greece|publisher=[[I.B.Tauris]]|page=39|isbn=1-84511-037-4|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterning his regime on other authoritarian European governments of the day (most notably [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]]), Metaxas banned political parties (including his own), prohibited [[Strike action|strikes]] and introduced widespread [[censorship]] of the media. National unity was to be achieved by the abolition of the previous political parliamentary system, which was seen as having left the country in chaos (see [[National Schism]]).&lt;ref name="petrakis32"&gt;Petrakis (2006), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Metaxas disliked the old parties of the political landscape, including traditional conservatives.&lt;ref name="petrakis32"/&gt; 

Along with [[anti-parliamentarism]], [[anti-communism]] formed the second major political agenda of the 4th of August regime.&lt;ref&gt;Petrakis (2006), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Minister of Security [[Konstantinos Maniadakis]] quickly infiltrated and practically dissolved the Communist Party of Greece by seizing its [[archive]]s and arresting Communist leader [[Nikos Zachariadis]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrakis (2006), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Metaxas himself became Minister of Education in 1938 and had all school texts re-written to fit the regime's ideology.&lt;ref name="petrakis37"/&gt;

Suppressing Communism was followed by a campaign against "anti-Greek" literature viewed as dangerous to the national interest.&lt;ref name="petrakis37"&gt;Petrakis (2006), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book burning]]s targeted authors such as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], and several Greek writers.&lt;ref name="petrakis37"/&gt; 

[[Arthur Koestler]], who visited Athens in 1938, noted that even [[Plato]]'s "[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]" was on Metaxas' list of prohibited books--which in Koestler's view made the Metaxas dictatorship "stupid as well as vicious".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} At that time Koestler met secretly with members of the underground opposition, hearing from them "horrifying stories of police brutality, especially the case of unspeakable torture inflicted on a young girl who was communist".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Koestler, "The Invisible Writing", Ch. 35&lt;/ref&gt; There had been rumors about the use of [[castor oil]] to political prisoners, just like in fascist Italy.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Trying to build a [[corporatism|corporatist]] state and secure popular support, Metaxas adopted or adapted many of Fascist Italy's institutions: a National Labor Service, the [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]], mandatory improvements to working conditions, and the [[Social Insurance Institute]] ({{lang-el|Ίδρυμα Κοινωνικών Ασφαλίσεων}}, IKA), still the biggest social security institution in Greece.{{cn|date=April 2018}} 

In terms of symbolism, the [[Roman salute]] and the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] double-axe, the ''[[labrys]]'', were introduced. Unlike Mussolini, however, Metaxas lacked the support provided by a mass political party; indeed, he deliberately positioned himself as being above politics. The regime's only mass organization was the [[National Organisation of Youth]] (EON), whose literature and magazines were promoted in schools.&lt;ref name="petrakis37"/&gt; Throughout his rule, Metaxas' power rested primarily upon the army and the support of King George II.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

===Foreign policy and the war with Italy===
{{main| Greco-Italian War}}
[[File:GambierParryMetaxasJorgeIIDalbiacYPapagosEnero1941--128421.jpeg|220px|right|thumb|Ioannis Metaxas with [[George II of Greece]] and [[Alexandros Papagos]] during a meeting of the Anglo-Greek War Council.]]
In foreign policy Metaxas followed a neutral stance, trying to balance between the UK and Germany. In the late 1930s, as with the other Balkan countries, Germany became Greece's largest trading partner. Metaxas himself had a reputation as a [[Germanophile]] dating back to his studies in Germany and his role in the National Schism. The regime's literature gave praise to fellow European authoritarian states, especially those of [[Francisco Franco]], [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Adolf Hitler]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

However, events gradually drove Metaxas to lean toward France and Britain. King George and most of the country's elites were staunchly [[anglophile]], and the predominance of the British [[Royal Navy]] in the Mediterranean could not be ignored by a maritime country such as Greece. Furthermore, the expansionist goals of Mussolini's Italy pushed Greece to lean towards the Franco-British alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Petrakis (2006), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Metaxas' efforts to keep Greece out of World War II came undone when Mussolini demanded occupation rights to strategic Greek sites. When the Italian ambassador Grazzi visited Metaxas' residence and presented these demands on the night of 28 October 1940, Metaxas curtly replied in French, ''"Alors, c'est la guerre"'' ("Then it is war"). A few hours later, Italy invaded Greece from [[Albania under Italy|Albania]] and started the [[Greco-Italian War]]. The Greek Army was able to mount a successful defence and counteroffensive, forcing the Italians back and occupying large parts of southern Albania, usually called by the Greeks "[[Northern Epirus]]". In April 1941 Germany invaded Greece.

==Death and legacy==
Metaxas never saw the joint Fascist-Nazi invasion of Greece during the [[Battle of Greece]] because he died in [[Athens]] on 29 January 1941 of a [[phlegmon]] of the pharynx, which subsequently led to incurable [[Bacteremia|toxaemia]]. He was succeeded by [[Alexandros Koryzis]]. After the death of Metaxas, the [[Battle of Greece|invading forces]] had to take into account the fortifications constructed by Metaxas in Northern Greece. These fortifications were constructed along the Bulgarian border and were known as the [[Metaxas Line]].

To this day Metaxas remains a highly controversial figure in Greek history. He is reviled by some for his dictatorial rule and admired by others for his popular policies{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}, [[patriotism]], defiance to aggression and his [[Greco-Italian War|military victory against Italy]].

Until the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]], Metaxas was honoured as the leader of the War against Italy. During the junta, with the exception of a small number of supporters of his regime (namely the banned “4th of August” organization) and few members of the government,  no major projects honouring Metaxas were undertaken. Some busts of Metaxas were put up in small towns and the periphery of Athens, mostly after local initiatives. An idea of erecting a Metaxas statue in central Athens was not accepted by the government and [[Georgios Papadopoulos]], who preferred to identify with [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] instead, inaugurated in Athens a big statue of latter. In the last years of junta, some minor local officials of the regime, disappointed by the liberalization steps planned by Papadopoulos, erected busts of Metaxas in some towns, in order to upset Papadopoulos. In the meantime, during and shortly after the dictatorship, an imagined ideological connection between the 1967 junta,  and the Metaxas regime and fascism was constructed, by means of books and works of art, such as the books of Spyros Linardatos on the 4th of August regime (1965 and 1966) and the film ''[[Days of '36]]'' by [[Theo Angelopoulos]].  This concept was adopted by the antidictatorial struggle and had a profound impact on subsequent historical production. A resistance group blew up a bust of Metaxas in a Piraeus suburb in 1972. The concept became mainstream after 1974. After 1980’s it was not considered proper to claim that the “NO” was said by Metaxas, but rather that it was articulated by the people. 

The microhistory of Metaxas’ statues is examined by Kouki K. and Antoniou D. in a study on the construction of an ideological commonality between Metaxas, the 1967 junta and fascism in modern Greek history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYak7FNkI8 Antoniou Dimitris,

Making the junta fascist: Antidictatorial struggle, the colonels, and the statues of Ioannis Metaxas. Journal of Modern Greek Studies, 35(2), 451-480]&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern era (21st century) Metaxas is remembered by the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] party, viewing his regime as the ideal for Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.gr/books?id=BdDKBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT70&amp;lpg=PT70&amp;dq=metaxas++golden+dawn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DR1wqM6Gxh&amp;sig=pUu7QuYj2VW1djZBboEwb-qqK3g&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiyzN2v2sTbAhWCQJoKHefSAnAQ6AEIbzAK#v=onepage&amp;q=metaxas%20%20golden%20dawn&amp;f=false S.

==Biography==
Suares was born on March 30, 1942, in [[Alexandria, Egypt]], to a [[Sephardic]] father. He and his family moved from Egypt to [[Italy]] when he was a teenager.

For over 30 years his comic drawings appeared in ''The New York Times'', on the covers of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', and in other periodicals and books. He wrote, edited or designed scores of illustrated books. He was also involved in book publishing. He worked with [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] at [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]. He also designed [[Michael Jackson]]’s autobiography, ''[[Moonwalk (book)|Moonwalk]]''. Suares was in one movie in 1973, ''It Happened in Hollywood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean Claude Suares|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3478117/|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''list of people killed by law enforcement officers in the United Kingdom''' documents cases of people who died directly or indirectly because of the actions of British [[law enforcement officers]], regardless of the manner of death, duty status of the officers, or if they acted officially or unofficially. It includes officers working for [[List of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom|all law enforcement agencies]], existing or historical, in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and [[Northern Ireland]], but excludes [[crown dependencies]], [[British colonies|colonies]] or other political entities subject or previously subjected to the direct control of the [[government of the United Kingdom]]. It also excludes deaths for which other government agents are responsible, such as deaths as a result of actions of the [[British Armed Forces]]. Earlier deaths in the mid-20th century also may not as be well documented; only deaths which have been confirmed by press releases or other media sources are listed.

After a public inquiry led by [[Willy Bach, Baron Bach|Lord Bach]], it was found that the killing of Rodney was unlawful and eventually resulted in the case for prosecution of the officer who fired the fatal shots for the charges of murder. However, the jury found the officer not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/azelle-rodney-killing-former-police-marksman-anthony-long-not-guilty-of-historic-murder-10364427.html|title=Azelle Rodney killing: Former police marksman Anthony Long not guilty|date=2015-07-03|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2017-06-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|21 November 1920
|Dublin, UK
|[[Bloody Sunday (1920)]]

'''Bloody Sunday''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Domhnach na Fola'') was a day of violence in [[Dublin]] on 21 November 1920, during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. In total, 32 people were killed, including thirteen British soldiers and police, sixteen Irish civilians, and three [[Irish republican]] prisoners. This includes people who were mortally wounded, but died later. Royal Marines officer [[Hugh Montgomery (Royal Marines officer)|Hugh Montgommery]] was shot in the morning and died on 10 December, and three people who were wounded at Croke Park died later - Robinson and Carroll on 23 November and Tom Hogan on 26 November.

The day began with an [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) operation, organised by [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], to assassinate the '[[Cairo Gang]]' – a team of undercover British intelligence agents working and living in Dublin.  IRA members went to a number of addresses and shot dead fourteen people (in addition, Montgomery was mortally wounded and died on 10 December): nine [[British Army]] officers (including Montgomery), a [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC) officer, two members of the [[Auxiliary Division]], two civilians, and one man (Leonard Wilde) whose exact status is uncertain.

Later that afternoon, members of the [[Auxiliary Division]] and RIC opened fire on the crowd at a [[Gaelic football]] match in [[Croke Park]], killing eleven civilians and wounding at least sixty, three of which died later (Robinson and Carroll on 23 November and Tom Hogan on 26 November). That evening, three IRA suspects being held in [[Dublin Castle]] were beaten and killed by their captors, who claimed they were trying to escape.

Overall, while its events cost relatively few lives, Bloody Sunday was considered a great victory for the IRA, as Collins's operation severely damaged British intelligence, while the later reprisals did no real damage to the guerrillas but increased support for the IRA at home and abroad.

'''Lunch meats'''—also known as '''cold cuts''', '''luncheon meats''', '''cooked meats''', '''sliced meats''', '''cold meats''' and '''deli meats'''—are precooked or [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] meat, often [[sausage]]s or [[meatloaf|meat loaves]], that are sliced and served cold or hot on [[sandwich]]es or on party trays.&lt;ref name=Today&gt;{{cite web|title=The 5 things you need to know about deli meats|url=http://www.today.com/id/16361276/ns/today-food/t/things-you-need-know-about-deli-meats/#.UUVfpXBUOxI|work=Today Food|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=17 March 2013|author=Phil Lempert|date=27 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be bought pre-sliced in [[vacuum packing|vacuum packs]] at a [[supermarket]] or [[grocery store]], or they can be purchased at a [[delicatessen]] or deli counter, where they might be sliced to order. Unsliced, [[canning|canned]] lunch meats are sold under brands such as [[Spam (food)|Spam]] and [[Treet]].

== Health ==
Most pre-sliced lunch meats are higher in [[fat]], [[nitrates]], and [[sodium]] than those that are sliced to order, as a larger exposed surface requires stronger preservatives.&lt;ref name="Today" /&gt; As a result, processed meats significantly contribute to incidence of [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]] and [[Diabetes insipidus|diabetes]], even more so than [[red meat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unprocessed red and processed meats and risk of coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes--an updated review of the evidence|journal = Current Atherosclerosis Reports|date = 2012-12-01|issn = 1534-6242|pmc = 3483430|pmid = 23001745|pages = 515–524|volume = 14|issue = 6|doi = 10.1007/s11883-012-0282-8|first = Renata|last = Micha|first2 = Georgios|last2 = Michas|first3 = Dariush|last3 = Mozaffarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prospective study following 448,568 people across Europe showed a positive association between processed [[meat consumption]] and mortality, due to cardiovascular diseases and [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Meat consumption and mortality--results from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition|journal = BMC Medicine|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1741-7015|pmc = 3599112|pmid = 23497300|pages = 63|volume = 11|doi = 10.1186/1741-7015-11-63|first = Sabine|last = Rohrmann|first2 = Kim|last2 = Overvad|first3 = H.

== Safety ==
The US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] advises that those over 50 reheat lunch meats to "steaming hot" {{convert|165|°F|°C|0|abbr=on}} and use them within four days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/yourlife/health/medical/2011-05-04-listeria-cdc-lunch-meat_n.htm |title=CDC: Over 50?

== Regional differences ==
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2018}}

=== Commonwealth countries ===
In [[The Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] countries, luncheon meat specifically refers to products that can include [[mechanically reclaimed meat]] and [[offal]]. In these countries, the terms "cold meats", "cooked meats", "deli meats", or "sliced meats" are used, instead.

=== Latin America ===

In [[Guatemala]], a lunch meat is a traditional dish eaten in November. It is eaten the first and second day of the month to celebrate ''El día de Todos los Santos'' ([[All Saints' Day]]) and ''El día de Todos los Difuntos'' ([[All Souls' Day]]). The two types are red and white.

=== Central Europe ===
The product got more popular after investigation what it contains. E.g. LUNCHEON MEAT TULIP (made in Denmark) is not made of 70% of meat as expected (base on country standard), but contains 18% of pork meat, 39% of chicken mechanically separated meat, 18% of pork mechanically separated meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/411702-velky-test-lunchmeatu-tohle-cteni-chce-silny-zaludek.html|title=Velký test lunchmeatů.

A doctor at the [[Kamloops Home for Men]] in the 1920s, he was able to interview many veterans of the province's early gold rush, including many of the more famous names in the history of the [[Cariboo Road]], the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]] and the [[Overlanders of 1862 led by Thomas McMicking]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Cariboo Road'', Mark Sweeten Wade, preface&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''This is Cariboo'', ''[[Robin Skelton]]'', Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote on medical legislation and hospital policy in the province of British Columbia as well as a biography of explorer [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]].  His works have served as an important source of biographical and historical detail by later historians.

==Biography==
:''This section is paraphrased from [http://kamloops.ca/museum/archives/pdfs/N56%20-%20Dr%20Mark%20Sweeten%20Wade.pdf ''"Dr. Mark Sweeten Wade"'', an unpublished typescript by Mary Gulliford] on the [[Kamloops Museum and Archives]] website.

He was born in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], [[County Durham]], [[England]] on November 23, 1858.  His parents were John Wade of [[Stockton-on-Tees]] and his mother was Mary Sweeten of [[Barnard Castle]].  After an education in British public schools (what would in North America be called private schools) and matriculated in the Faculty of Medicine at [[Durham University]].  He emigrated to Canada in 1881 and pursued further studies in medicine at [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] and returning to Canada in 1882 was hired as a medical officer for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway survey]] with the party surveying the Qu'Appelle, Regina, Moose Jaw and Swift Current area.  In the fall of that year he returned to school at the [[University of Toronto]] General Hospital, finishing in 1883.  He returned to England for a short visit, then upon re-entry to Canada at [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria, B.C.]] registered as a medical practitioner and took land in the [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] area near his brother Edmund Wade, practicing there until 1884.  He hired on with [[Andrew Onderdonk]]'s construction operations for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], then based in [[Spences Bridge]] and [[Savona, British Columbia|Savona]].  There he met Emma Uren, daughter of [[James Bottrell Uren]], who ran the local hotel and also the ferry, on March 10, 1885.  Upon the completion of the CPR he moved to [[Clinton, British Columbia|Clinton]] and was the resident physician there until 1889.

In 1889 Wade went to [[San Francisco]] to study medicine at the [[University of California, San Francisco]], returning to live in Victoria after graduation and practicing medicine there until 1895.  During a major [[List of smallpox epidemics|smallpox epidemic]] in 1892 he was appointed Chief Medical Officer of the province by [[Premier of British Columbia|Premier]] [[Theodore Davie]].  In 1895, he moved to [[Kamloops]] and open practice as an [[ear, nose and throat specialist]] in offices across from that city's ''Dominion Hotel''.  A growing interest in newspaper writing led to his appointment as Editor of the ''[[Inland Sentinel]]'' when that paper's editor and publisher, [[Francis John Deane|F.J. Deane]], was elected as a [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] of [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia|British Columbia]] for [[Yale-West]] (which Kamloops was in at the time) and needed to be freed up from his editorial activities to pursue politics in Victoria and around the [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]].  Although the provincial legislature as yet did not have political parties, both men were ardent [[Liberal Party of British Columbia|Liberal]]s and the newspaper espoused Liberal politics.  In the same year he was appointed doctor for the Provincial Home for men and the local jail, and in 1899 he was appointed coroner and in 1900 elected vice-president of the Kamloops Liberal Association and also elected to the [[Board of Trade]]. Deane lost re-election in 1902 to [[F.J. Fulton]] and due to most such appointments in the province being from [[patronage]], Wade also lost his position as jail doctor and coroner.

Deane bought the ''[[Nelson Miner]]'' in 1902 and renamed it the ''[[Nelson Daily News]]'', with Wade also contributing to it as a writer.  In 1904 Deane sold the ''Inland Sentinel'' to Wade, who continued publishing it as a small paper covering only local and district news.  In 1910, he tied the paper into a [[wire service]] and expanded it to eight pages as a weekly, covering world news and little local news.  Wade's activities on the Board of Trade and a group known as the 10,000 Club (which like others of its time sought to promote growth in the city to a population of 10,000), Wade engaged in an advertising campaign to draw industries to the city, promoting ventures such as a tourist hotel, steamboat service on the [[North Thompson River]], a cannery, a creamery, a flour mill and a cold storage plant..  As part of his promotional zeal and in time for the Christmas sales market of 1907, Wade published ''The Thompson Country'', which biographer Mary Gulliford notes was error-ridden and "had an air of carelessness.  It was probably due to increased demand for advertising of the Kamloops district that caused the hurried job."  Wade also took part in the city's negotiations with the [[Canadian National Railway]] concerning sites for stations and [[workshop|shops]] in the Kamloops area for that railway's expansion of a line to the [[Okanagan]].  Wade helped organized the memorial service for King [[Edward VII]], held in the city's Riverside Park and was on the city's welcoming committee when [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Wilfrid Laurier|Sir Wilfrid Laurier]] came to town.  He sold the ''Sentinel'' in 1912 and was elected alderman in 1913, retiring from the position and touring Europe briefly in 1914, returning to serve as a member of the medical board examining new recruits for the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]].

During his lifetime Wade wrote two books other than ''The Thompson Country''.  ''Mackenzie of Canada: The Life and Adventurers of Alexander Mackenzie, Discoverer'' was the first biography ever published on the famous explorer.  His ''The Overlanders of '62'', which had been commissioned by the provincial government, was unfinished at the time of his death and was edited and published by provincial Archivist and Librarian [[John Hosie]] in 1932.  His biographer summarizes &lt;blockquote&gt;
''"It was said of Wade as a historian "no pains in research were too strenuous" and certainly ''The Overlanders'' displays this trait.  He possessed every scrap of evidence on the Overlanders that was to be had in diaries and correspondence and by word of mouth.  The book is very meticulous and a fascinating work."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wade died in 1929 leaving his wife Emma and son M. Leighton; another son, Daryl Fred, had died in 1920 after operating as an auto mechanic in Kamloops from 1912 and serving in the war from 1916 onwards to its completion.  M. Leighton earned a [Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.] from [[McGill University]] and was involved in construction of the Mt. Olie power plant near Kamloops in 1913 and later supervised construction of hydroelectric development at Adams Lake, also becoming superintendent of the [[East Kootenay Power Co.]] in 1930 and from 1934 onwards was in charge of the Kamloops area highway department.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2507">{{about|the nuclear warfare term|the thrash metal band|Megadeth}}

'''Megadeath''' (or '''megacorpse''') is one million human deaths, usually caused by a [[nuclear explosion]]. The term was used by scientists and thinkers who strategized likely outcomes of [[all-out nuclear warfare]].

==History==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s first citation for the term is a 1953 article from the ''[[Birmingham News]]'', and it appears again in 1959 in the ''[[New Statesman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|megadeath}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used to refer to the "megadeath intellectuals", the group of thinkers surrounding [[RAND Corporation]] strategist [[Herman Kahn]]. The concept was notably discussed in Kahn's 1960 book, ''[[On Thermonuclear War]]''.

In the book, Kahn observes that "It was difficult for people to distinguish in the early 1950s between 2 million deaths and 100 million deaths. Today, after a decade of pondering these problems, we can make such distinctions perhaps all too clearly. Most of the decision makers and planners who have been facing the prospects of a thermonuclear war would find it difficult to distinguish between zero and two million deaths and very easy to distinguish between two million and a hundred million deaths."&lt;ref name=Kahn-1960&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahn|first=Hermann|title=On Thermonuclear War|year=1960|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, U.S.|isbn=978-0-313-20060-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a table, Kahn outlines "tragic but distinguishable postwar states" in which the number of deaths range from 2 million to 160 million, and asks "will the survivors envy the dead ?".&lt;ref name=Kahn-1960 /&gt;

==Legacy==
Though the term was created in order to discuss the likely consequences of conducting [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], such a large number of deaths could also be associated with other nation-state [[weapons of mass destruction]].  An extension of this is the term '''Gigadeath''' describing deaths in billions such as projected by retired Artificial Intelligence researcher [[Hugo de Garis]] as the consequence of an inevitable future war between proponents and opponents of Artificial Intelligent entities. He calls this conflict [[The Artilect War]].

American guitarist [[Dave Mustaine]] took inspiration from the term to create the monicker of his [[thrash metal]] band [[Megadeth]].

'''Michael Simon Toon''' (born 12 March 1977) is an English photographer, filmmaker, designer and builder.

==Short films==
Toon has made two short films in the style of [[cinéma vérité]] which are globally recognised as serious inquiries into the nature of life:

Toon self-produced ''[[Thought Moments]]'' (2004) which examines [[microexpressions]] by slowing down footage of a wide range of individuals answering seemingly innocuous questions. Toon, a former [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Caroline |last=McGhie |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/9611852/The-rise-of-the-Modernist-eco-friendly-home.html |title=The rise of Modernist, eco-friendly home |publisher= The Telegraph |date=26 October 2002 |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; titled ''Thought Moments'' after the Buddhist term for the mental states we experience when a physical or mental object enters the mind. The film is part of the British Film Council's library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://film.britishcouncil.org/thought-moments |title=Thought Moments |publisher=British Films Directory |date=12 January 2009 |accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also reproduced as coursework in [[neurolinguistic programming]] by students of psychology in several languages across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Prof. |last=Ragodí |url=http://elbigotedebernays.blogspot.com/2009/11/trabajo-psicologia-1er-trimestre.html |title=Trabajo Psicología de 1er Trimestre El Bigote de Bernays |publisher=Blogspot |date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Hakan |first=Mirac |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPVo6QyEaYk |title=Eye Accessing Cues |publisher=YouTube |date=18 March 2010 |accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YEWK98aTog |title=Thought Moments |publisher=YouTube |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their youngest son, '''Henry Chau''' '''Hoi-leung''' ({{zh|周凱亮|labels=no}}, 28 at the time of the murder), and his friend '''Angus Tse''' '''Chun-kei''' ({{zh|謝臻麒|labels=no}}, 35 at the time of the murder), were indicted for the murder, which they initially denied being involved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/realtime/news/20130315/51300595|title=【逆子弒父母】  退休夫婦慘遭逆子謀財害命 - 即時新聞 - 要聞 - 20130315|work=Apple Daily 蘋果日報|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Chau and Tse's interviews with the police, they admitted that after the murder, they chopped up the parents' dead bodies and cooked the remains with salt to make them look "like barbecue pork."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1721953/son-dismembered-parents-get-their-money-trial-told|title=Son chopped up his parents and put heads in the fridge, Hong Kong court hears|date=23 February 2015|work=South China Morning Post|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They kept part of the remains in lunch boxes, which they stored in the refrigerator. The gruesome details of the murder sparked a huge amount of media coverage in Hong Kong.

On March 20, 2015, High Court deputy judge Michael Stuart-Moore found Chau guilty of double murder while finding his accomplice Tse not guilty on both counts of murder.

==Timeline of events==
On March 12, 2013, five days after filing a missing persons report, the two Chau brothers heard from the police that there were no (departure) records of their parents leaving Hong Kong. Thus on March 13, 2013, Henry Chau Hoi-leung and his older brother approached ''[[Apple Daily]]'', claiming that they had not heard from their parents since the 2nd of March. Chau stated that before their disappearance, his parents had informed him that they were planning to travel to mainland China. The brothers then created a Facebook page titled, "My missing dad and mom", and asked their friends and the public for any information that could link to their parents' whereabouts.

On March 14, 2013, Henry Chau was invited to the police station for further questioning. ''Apple Daily'' released articles about the Chau brothers' struggle to find their missing parents. During the police interview, Chau texted his friends in a [[WhatsApp]] group "HK-Tekken" and confessed to the crime. Chau even described the details and reasons for the murder.
 
On March 15, 2013, a day after the interview, Chau and his friend, Angus Tse Chun-kei, were indicted for killing and dismembering Chau's parents in Tse's [[Tai Kok Tsui]] flat in the Long Beach Building. According to reports, Chau invited his parents to visit Tse's flat, telling them that it was a new flat he had just rented, and murdered his parents with Tse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/gangao/2014-08/06/c_126838940.htm|title=香港逆子弒雙親碎屍案開審 子割喉殺父友殺其母|work=xinhuanet.com|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deaths of Glory Chau and Moon Siu ==
During further interrogation and investigation, Chau claimed that he and Tse coordinated the attack the moment Glory Chau and Moon Siu arrived in the living room because this was the time "when they felt ready." Chau described his accomplice Tse as a "very powerful" man who covered Moon Siu's mouth from behind while slashing her throat. Henry Chau admitted to stabbing his father in the back of the neck, but stated Tse had finished the job by slashing Glory Chau's throat. The autopsy report further confirmed the cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.now.com/home/local/player?newsId=109244|title=周凱亮：殺人計劃構思半年|work=now.com|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scmp.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1571243/henry-chau-and-friend-spent-six-months-planning-parents-killing-court|title=Henry Chau 'decided to murder his parents for putting pressure on him'|date=11 August 2014|work=South China Morning Post|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Chau returned to the Tai Kok Tsui crime scene four days after the incident, at the time when Tse already had all the body parts dismembered, salted, refrigerated, and demoisturized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=154869&amp;sid=44011784&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20150305 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402173802/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=154869&amp;sid=44011784&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20150305 |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chau described his role in the double murder as 'killing only', while Tse dismembered the bodies.
 
According to Chau, Tse initially attempted to disguise the remains as bricks by covering them with cement and sand. Then he came up with an easier plan to cook the remains of the bodies and disguise them as ''[[char siu]]'', barbecued pork. Some of the remains were also covered with sand and thrown into the sea.&lt;ref name="scmp.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hk.news.yahoo.com/%E5%BC%92%E9%9B%99%E8%A6%AA%E7%A2%8E%E5%B1%8D%E6%A1%88%E8%AD%A6%E6%8C%87%E6%AC%A1%E8%A2%AB%E5%91%8A%E7%A8%B1%E5%86%87%E6%AE%BA%E4%BA%BA-074900128.html|title=弒雙親碎屍案警指次被告稱冇殺人|date=3 March 2015|work=Yahoo 新聞香港|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the investigation held on March 15, 2013, the heads of the two victims were found inside the two separate refrigerators. In those refrigerators, lunch boxes containing microwaved human flesh, and three bags containing chopped limbs and other body parts were found. According to the video interviews shown to the jury, Chau said that his father was "an arrogant man who left [Chau] without a moment of peace" while his mother "always looked sadly when [Chau] did not contribute to the family."
"I thought that if I could resolve the emotional connection with my parents, it would be a solution," he said. "If they died, I could be reborn."&lt;ref name="scmp.com"/&gt; He blamed his parents for his failures in life, such as his father distracting his studies by watching television at a high volume, and his mother forcing him to practice the piano and humiliating him in front of a girl.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1745300/son-who-killed-and-dismembered-parents-gruesome-hong-kong-murders|title=Son who chopped up parents and kept heads in the fridge jailed for life in Hong Kong|last=Chu|first=Julie|date=2015-03-15|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial proceedings==
The Court of First Instance began the first hearing on August 4, 2014, with both Chau and Tse as the defendants. The initial jury of seven was reduced to six during the first week of testimony. Soon after, another jury member asked for dismissal due to the psychological stress burdening him. On August 13, 2014, High Court Deputy Judge Michael Stuart-Moore announced that the case would have to be restarted with a fresh jury of nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadailyasia.com/hknews/2014-08/14/content_15156616.html|title=Sordid details of murder case too much for jury|work=chinadailyasia.com|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial resumed in February 2015. Throughout the course of the trial, Chau's defense argued on the basis of diminished responsibility due to his mental instability. Meanwhile, the prosecution stresses the meticulous planning of Henry Chau with his multiple confessions.

On March 9, 2015, the defense lawyer, Nicholas Adams, called psychiatrist Chung Ka-fai to the stand. Chung diagnosed Chau with [[bipolar disorder]] and [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive disorder]]. Chung stated that Chau had experienced many suicidal thoughts after dropping out of college, being rejected by women, and being unemployed, giving a possible psychological trigger for the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=155031&amp;sid=44041346&amp;con_type=3&amp;d_str=20150310 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150406212702/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=155031&amp;sid=44041346&amp;con_type=3&amp;d_str=20150310 |archivedate=2015-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The consultant of [[Siu Lam Hospital|Siu Lam Psychiatric Centre]], Lui Sing-Heung, conducted an IQ test for Tse and Chau. Chau's IQ was found to be 126, higher than average, while Tse's IQ is 84. Lui argued the possibility that Chau, having such a higher IQ than Tse, could have manipulated and framed Tse for the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20150312/19073109|title=周凱亮IQ126: 次被告僅84 專家：智商差距大難做朋友：周或卸責同黨 - 蘋果日報 - 要聞港聞 - 20150312|work=Apple Daily 蘋果日報|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 20, 2015, the verdict was passed. High Court deputy judge Michael Stuart-Moore found Chau guilty of double murder while finding his accomplice Tse not guilty on both counts of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/asia/henry-chau-is-found-guilty-of-gruesome-double-murder/story-fnh81fz8-1227274888558|title=Henry Chau: Hong Kong man who killed his parents found guilty|work=NewsComAu|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chau was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] while Tse was sentenced to one year for [[Preventing the lawful burial of a body|preventing the lawful burial of the bodies]]. As Tse had already been detained for two years on [[Remand (detention)|remand]], he was released immediately.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The case was adapted into an episode of the Chinese-language miniseries ''Stained'' (心冤; debuted 2017) produced by [[Fox Networks Group|Fox Networks Group Asia]] and directed by [[Patrick Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hk01.com/%E9%9B%BB%E5%BD%B1/141410/%E5%BF%83%E5%86%A4-%E9%87%8D%E7%8F%BE%E5%A4%A7%E8%A7%92%E5%92%80%E8%A1%80%E8%85%A5%E8%82%A2%E8%A7%A3%E7%88%B6%E6%AF%8D%E6%A1%88-%E5%90%B3%E8%82%87%E8%BB%92%E5%85%87%E6%AE%98%E6%BC%94%E7%B9%B9%E5%86%B7%E8%A1%80%E5%85%92%E5%AD%90|title=【心冤】重現大角咀血腥肢解父母案　吳肇軒兇殘演繹冷血兒子|last=許育民|date=2017-12-14|work=香港01|access-date=2018-11-06|language=zh-HK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Molchanova was the world's most decorated free diver ever, holding 41 world records at the time of her presumed death and winning 23 gold medals during her lengthy career.&lt;ref name="nbcnews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/natalia-molchanova-freediving-champion-missing-feared-dead-n404331|title=Natalia Molchanova, Freediving Champion, Missing and Feared Dead|date=5 August 2015|accessdate=5 August 2015|agency=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[AIDA_International#History|2007 Freediving World Championships]] in [[Maribor]], [[Slovenia]], her winning time in the static discipline was better than the winning male gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/natalia-molchanova-worlds-most-successful-freedriver-is-missing-and-feared-dead-after-disappearing-in-mediterranean-10438926.html|title=Natalia Molchanova: World's most successful free-diver missing and feared dead after disappearing in Mediterranean|work=The Independent|date=4 August 2015|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, she became the first woman to pass 100 meters (328 ft.) diving with constant weight, in a dive to 101 meters (331 ft.) in [[Sharm el Sheikh]], [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.deeperblue.com/new-world-record-molchanova-cwt-101m/|title=New World Record – Molchanova CWT 101m|agency=Deeper Blue|date=24 September 2009|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molchanova was also the first woman to dive on one breath through the [[Blue Hole (Red Sea)|Blue Hole]] arch in [[Dahab]], Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/natalia-molchanova-freewater-diving-champion-6194341|title=Natalia Molchanova: Freewater diving champion missing presumed dead following practice session in Ibiza|date=4 August 2015|accessdate=5 August 2015|work=Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her record was a dive of 127 metres (417 ft.).&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Telegraph, Friday 9 October 2015, Obituary [paper only], p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a [[horror game]] drawing inspiration from the lead designer Matt Gilgenbach's personal struggles with [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]];&lt;ref name=Personal_inspiration&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/7/23/4529198/neverending-nightmares-retro-grade-matt-gilgenbach|last=McElroy|first=Justin|title=The Neverending Nightmare of Retro/Grade creator Matt Gilgenbach|work=[[Polygon (website)]]|date=23 July 2013|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an interview, he stated that he was "trying to create that feeling [of bleakness and hopelessness] in ''Neverending Nightmares''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=VanOrd|first1=Kevin|title=Neverending Nightmares: How OCD Inspired a Psychological Horror Breakthrough|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/neverending-nightmares-how-ocd-inspired-a-psychological-horror-breakthrough/1100-6414083/|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=4 June 2014|date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The player takes the role of Thomas, a man who "wakes up" from one nightmare and into another. As the player navigates Thomas throughout the game, the nightmares become progressively worse and worse, including the horrifying monsters that lurk within them. Each time Thomas dies in a nightmare, comes across some serious cause of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], or commits [[self-harm]], he will "wake up" again in either the same nightmare as before, or into a different one. This acts as the game's [[Checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoint]] and [[Saved game|save system]]. The game contains a total of three different endings, all influenced by the player's choices or paths that they take.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The game features a 2D hand-drawn [[line art]] style heavily influenced by the works of [[Edward Gorey]].&lt;ref name=Edward_Gorey_influence&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Neverending-Nightmares-Horror-Game-Channels-Art-Edward-Gorey-58923.html|last=Usher|first=William|title=Neverending Nightmares Is A Horror Game That Channels The Art Of Edward Gorey|work=Gaming Blend|date=8 September 2013|accessdate= 3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a [[minimalism|minimalist]] [[user interface]], forgoing onscreen prompts and loading screens during play in order to increase [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]].&lt;ref&gt;http://steamcommunity.com/id/StacheSplosion/recommended/253330/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Setting and characters===
''Neverending Nightmares'' revolves around Thomas Smith, a young man who is suffering from a seemingly-endless string of [[nightmare]]s (hence the title). Another character, Gabby, is introduced as Thomas' little sister, and frequently appears in his nightmares, occasionally changing roles. At turning points in the game, Thomas finds Gabby dead in various situations; Thomas himself also dies in his nightmares, sometimes [[suicide|by his own hand]], though this only leads him to wake up in yet another nightmare.

Throughout the game, which is implied to be set in the late 1800s, Thomas must explore various locations in his nightmares. These include a [[mansion]], a [[cemetery]], an [[insane asylum]], a [[forest]], and a [[hospital]].

===Story===
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
The game begins with Thomas "waking up" from a nightmare, in which he had stabbed his younger sister Gabby in the stomach. As he wanders through each nightmare, "waking up" in a bed each time, the player sees Thomas commit gruesome acts of [[self-harm]] out of depression, such as pulling a [[blood vessel]] or even a bone out of his arm.

Depending on the player's actions, Thomas will finally wake up into one of three different endings.
* '''Wayward Dreamer''': after waking up, a young Thomas goes to Gabby's room, where he kisses his sleeping sister good-night.&lt;ref name="dev diary 213"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xke58wkC4vE&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Destroyed Dreams''': after escaping a nightmarish version of himself, Thomas slowly awakens in a hospital, his arms bandaged and bloody. Gabby, either as his sister or wife, begs him to wake up, and rejoices when he finally does.&lt;ref name="dev diary 213"/&gt;
* '''The Final Descent''': an adult Thomas wakes up at his desk, where he reads a letter from Gabrielle, his wife. After the loss of their daughter, Gabrielle was forced to leave Thomas, as he couldn't get over the tragedy. After reading the letter, Thomas quietly weeps in his chair. A portrait on the wall implies that the girl murdered at the beginning was his daughter, not Gabrielle.&lt;ref name="dev diary 213"/&gt;

== Development ==
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
In September 2013, a [[Kickstarter]] campaign for the game's development was successfully funded, raising $106,722 of its original $99,000 goal.&lt;ref name=Kickstarter_funding&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/infinitap/neverending-nightmares|last=Gilgenbach|first=Matt|title=Neverending Nightmares Kickstarter|accessdate=3 June 2014|date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[Ouya]] on September 26, 2014.&lt;ref name="Neverending_Nightmares_Release" /&gt;

''Neverending Nightmares'' received largely positive buzz during the course of its development.

'''Prometic Life Sciences Inc.''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] publicly traded [[biopharmaceutical]] company.

==History==

Prometic was founded in 1988, as a commercial spinoff of research at the University of Cambridge on [[affinity chromatography]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/leadership/ceo-of-the-year/most-innovative-ceo-pierre-laurin-prometic-life-sciences/|title=Most Innovative CEO of the Year: Pierre Laurin, Prometic|date=2015-10-19|work=Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its founder was the current President and CEO, Pierre Laurin, whose research formed the basis for the company's products.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  On May 19, 1998,the Corporation went public through a listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

In August 2016, the company announced the acquisition of [[Telesta Therapeutics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/prometic-to-acquire-telesta-therapeutics/81253125/|title=ProMetic to Acquire Telesta Therapeutics - GEN|website=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==

Most of the company's products are based on its affinity chromatography process.  One use of this process is the purification of drugs, reducing impurities and thus side effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A second use is removing pathogens from human blood; in 2002, ProMetic formed a joint venture with the American Red Cross to remove pathogens and viruses from collected blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/prometic-to-team-with-red-cross/article4133590/|title=ProMetic to team with Red Cross|last=|first=|date=2002-04-22|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-04-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third application is to extract and purify therapeutic proteins from human plasma, which are then used in the creation of therapeutics and orphan drugs.

Prometic has two business segments: the protein technologies segment and the small-molecule therapeutics segment.

{{Signs of death}}

'''Putrefaction''' is the fifth [[Stages of death|stage of death]], following [[pallor mortis]], [[algor mortis]], [[rigor mortis]], and [[livor mortis]]. This process references the breaking down of a body of a human or animal [[Post-mortem (disambiguation)|post-mortem]] (meaning after death). In broad terms, it can be viewed as the decomposition of [[protein]]s, and the eventual breakdown of the cohesiveness between tissues, and the liquefaction of most organs. This is caused by the decomposition of organic matter by bacterial or fungal digestion, which causes the release of gases that infiltrate the body's tissues, and leads to the deterioration of the tissues and organs. 
The approximate time it takes putrefaction to occur is dependent on various factors. Internal factors that affect the rate of putrefaction include the age at which death has occurred, the overall structure and condition of the body, the cause of death, and external injuries arising before or after death. External factors include environmental temperature, moisture and air exposure, clothing, burial factors, and light exposure. 

The first signs of putrefaction are signified by a greenish discoloration on the outside of the skin on the abdominal wall corresponding to where the large intestine begins, as well as under the surface of the liver.

Certain substances, such as [[Phenol|carbolic acid]], [[arsenic]], [[strychnine]], and [[zinc chloride]], can be used to delay the process of putrefaction in various ways based on their chemical make up. 

[[Body farm|Body farms]] are facilities which study the process of human decomposition as well as how environmental factors affect the rate of putrefaction.

==Description==
'''''Caution: Some of the photographs that follow may be disturbing to some readers.'''''

In [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] terms, all organic tissues are composed of chemical energy, which, when not maintained by the constant biochemical maintenance of the living organism, begin to chemically break down due to the reaction with water into [[amino acids]], known as hydrolysis. The breakdown of the proteins of a decomposing body is a [[spontaneous process]]. [[Protein hydrolysis]] is accelerated as the [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic bacteria]] of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]] consume, digest, and excrete the cellular proteins of the body.

[[File:Rogers body.jpg|thumb|Putrefaction in human hands after several days of one of the [[Oba Chandler]] victims underwater in Florida, United States]]

The bacterial digestion of the cellular proteins weakens the tissues of the body. As the proteins are continuously broken down to smaller components, the bacteria excrete gases and [[organic compound]]s, such as the [[functional group|functional-group]] [[amine]]s [[putrescine]] (from [[ornithine]]) and [[cadaverine]] (from [[lysine]]), which carry the noxious odor of rotten flesh. Initially, the gases of putrefaction are constrained within the body cavities, but eventually diffuse through the adjacent tissues, and then into the [[circulatory system]]. Once in the blood vessels, the putrid gases infiltrate and diffuse to other parts of the body and the limbs.

The visual result of gaseous tissue-infiltration is notable bloating of the torso and limbs. The increased, internal pressure of the continually rising volume of gas further stresses, weakens, and separates the tissues constraining the gas. In the course of putrefaction, the skin tissues of the body eventually rupture and release the bacterial gas. As the anaerobic bacteria continue consuming, digesting, and excreting the tissue proteins, the body's decomposition progresses to the stage of [[skeletonisation|skeletonization]]. This continued consumption also results in the production of [[ethanol]] by the bacteria, which can make it difficult to determine the [[Blood Alcohol Concentration|BAC]] in autopsies, particularly in bodies recovered from water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Fredrik C. Kugelberg, Alan Wayne Jones| year = 2007 | volume = 165 | pages = 10–27 | title = Interpreting results of ethanol analysis in postmortem specimens: A review of the literature | doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2006.05.004| journal = [[Forensic Science International (journal)|Forensic Science International]]| issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the term ''decomposition'' encompasses the biochemical processes that occur from the physical death of the person (or animal) until the skeletonization of the body. Putrefaction is one of seven stages of [[decomposition]]; as such, the term ''putrescible'' identifies all organic matter (animal and human) that is [[Biochemistry|biochemically]] subject to putrefaction. In the matter of death by poisoning, the putrefaction of the body is chemically delayed by poisons such as [[antimony]], [[arsenic]], [[carbolic acid]] (phenol), ''[[nux vomica]]'' (plant), [[strychnine]] (pesticide), and [[zinc chloride]].

==Approximate timeline==
* 1–2 days: Pallor Mortis, Algor Mortis, Rigor Mortis, and Livor Mortis are the first steps in the process of decomposition before the process of putrefaction.
* 2–3 days: Discoloration appears on the skin of the [[abdomen]]. The abdomen begins to swell due to gas formation.
* 3–4 days: The discoloration spreads and discolored veins become visible.
* 5–6 days: The abdomen swells noticeably and the skin blisters.
* 10–20 days: Black putrefaction occurs, which is when noxious odors are released from the body and the parts of the body undergo a black discoloration.
* 2 weeks: The abdomen is bloated; internal gas pressure nears maximum capacity. 
* 3 weeks: Tissues have softened. Organs and cavities are bursting. The nails fall off.
* 4 weeks: Soft tissues such as the internal organs begin to [[Liquefaction|liquefy]] and the face becomes unrecognizable. Leads to skeletonization where the skin, muscles, tendons and ligaments degrade exposing the skeleton.

The rate of putrefaction is greatest in air, followed by water, soil, and earth. The exact rate of putrefaction is dependent upon many factors such as weather, exposure and location. Thus, refrigeration at a morgue or funeral home can retard the process, allowing for burial in three days or so following death without [[embalming]].  The rate increases dramatically in tropical climates. The first external sign of putrefaction in a body lying in air is usually a greenish discoloration of the skin over the region of the [[caecum]], which appears in 12–24 hours. The first internal sign is usually a greenish discoloration on the undersurface of liver.

==Factors affecting putrefaction==
Various factors affect the rate of putrefaction.&lt;ref name="Vij2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vij|title=Textbook of Forensic Medicine And Toxicology: Principles And Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vp8FAsnfGF4C&amp;pg=PT143|date=January 1, 2008|publisher=Elsevier India|isbn=978-81-312-1129-8|pages=142–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biswas2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gautam Biswas|title=Review of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JdZN69AecoC&amp;pg=RA2-PA19|year=2012|publisher=JP Medical Ltd|isbn=978-93-5025-896-5|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
&lt;!-- Expansion of the related sections needs to done from the above mentioned sources --&gt;

===Exogenous (external)===
'''Environmental temperature''': Decomposition is speed by high atmospheric or environmental temperature, with putrefaction speed optimized between 21 and 38&amp;nbsp;°C, further speed along by high levels of humidity. This optimal temperature assists in the chemical breakdown of the tissue and promoting microorganism growth. Decomposition nearly stops below 0&amp;nbsp;°C or above 48&amp;nbsp;°C.

'''Moisture and air exposure''': Putrefaction is ordinarily slowed by the body being submerged in water, due to diminished exposure to air. Air exposure and moisture both can contribute to the introduction and growth of microorganisms, speeding degradation. In a hot and dry environment the body can undergo a process called mummification where the body is completely dehydrated and bacterial decay is inhibited.

'''Clothing:''' Loose-fitting clothing can speed up the rate of putrefaction, as it helps to retain body heat. Tight-fitting clothing can delay the process by cutting off blood supply to tissues and eliminating nutrients for bacteria to feed on.

'''Manner of burial''': Speedy burial can slow putrefaction. Bodies within deep graves tend to decompose more slowly due to the diminished influences of changes in temperature. The composition of graves can also be a significant contributing factor, with dense, clay-like soil tending to speed putrefaction while dry and sandy soil slows it.

'''Light exposure''': Light can also contribute indirectly, as flies and insects prefer to lay eggs in areas of the body not exposed to light, such as the crevices formed by the eyelids and nostrils.&lt;ref name="Vij2008"/&gt;

===Endogenous (internal)===
'''Age of death''': Stillborn fetuses and infants putrefy slowly due to their sterility. Otherwise, however, generally, younger people putrefy more quickly than older people.

'''Condition of the body''': A body with a greater fat percentage and less lean body mass will have a faster rate of putrefaction, as fat retains more heat and it carries a larger amount of fluid in the tissues.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forensicpathologyonline.com/e-book/post-mortem-changes/putrefaction|title=Putrefaction|last=Rao|first=Dinesh|date=2013|website=Dr. Dinesh Rao's Forensic Pathology|publisher=forensicpathologyonline.com|access-date=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cause of death''': The cause of death has a direct relationship to putrefaction speed, with bodies that died from acute violence or accident generally putrefying slower than those that died from infectious diseases. Certain poisons, such as [[potassium cyanide]] or [[strychnine]], may also delay putrefaction, while chronic alcoholism will speed it.
 
'''External injuries''': Antemortem or postmortem injuries can speed putrefaction as injured areas can be more susceptible to invasion by bacteria.

===Delayed putrefaction===
Certain poisonous substances to the body can delay the process of putrefaction. They include:
* [[Carbolic acid]] (Phenol)
* [[Arsenic]] and [[antimony]]&lt;ref name="Sharma2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sharma|title=Concise Textbook of Forensic Medicine &amp; Toxicology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_zAwlKX_zNwC&amp;pg=PA49|date=January 1, 2007|publisher=Elsevier India|isbn=978-81-312-1145-8|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Strychnine]]&lt;ref name="Sharma2007" /&gt;
* [[Strychnos nux-vomica|Nux Vomica]] (Plant)
* [[Zinc chloride]], ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

=== Embalming ===
[[Embalming]] is the process of preserving human remains by delaying decomposition. This is acquired through the use of embalming fluid, which is a mixture of formaldehyde, methanol, and various other solvents. The most common reasons to briefly preserve the body are for viewing purposes at a funeral and for medical or religious practices.

==Research==
[[Body farm]]s subject donated cadavers to various environmental conditions to study the process of human decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Killgrove|first1=Kristina|title=These six 'Body Farms' Help Forensic Anthropologists Learn To Solve Crimes|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinakillgrove/2015/06/10/these-six-body-farms-help-forensic-anthropologists-learn-to-solve-crimes/#37abd4b816fb|website=Forbes|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include The University of Tennessee's Forensic Anthropologic Facility, Western Carolina Universities Osteology Research Station (FOREST), Texas State University's Forensic Anthropology Research Facility (FARF), Sam Houston State University's Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science Facility (STAFS), Southern Illinois University's Complex for Forensic Anthropology Research, and Colorado Mesa University's Forensic Investigation Research Station. The Australian Facility for Taphonomic Experimental Research, near [[Sydney]], is the first body farm located outside of the United States &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-18/australias-only-body-farm-helping-crime-scene-investigators/7939664|title=Inside the secret Australian body farm helping real-life CSIs|date=2016-10-18|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In The United Kingdom there are several facilities which, instead of using human remains or cadavers, use dead pigs to study the decomposition process. Pigs are less likely to have infectious diseases than human cadavers, and are more readily available without any concern for ethical issues, but a human body farm is still highly sought after for further research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Anna|title=Coming to a field near you?

In [[alchemy]], putrefaction is the same as [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]], whereby a substance is allowed to rot or decompose undisturbed.  In some cases, the commencement of the process is facilitated with a small sample of the desired material to act as a "seed".{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

'''Roger Bruce Chaffee''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|æ|f|iː}}, February 15, 1935 – January 27, 1967) was an American [[Officer (armed forces)|naval officer]] and [[United States naval aviator|naval aviator]], [[Aeronautical engineering|aeronautical]] [[engineer]], and [[NASA]] [[astronaut]] in the [[Apollo program]].

Chaffee was born in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], where he became an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]. He graduated from [[Central High School (Grand Rapids, Michigan)|Central High School]] in 1953, and accepted a [[Naval ROTC|Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]] (NROTC) scholarship. He began his college education at [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], where he was also involved in the fraternity [[Phi Kappa Sigma]]. He transferred to [[Purdue University]] in the autumn of 1954, where he continued his involvement in Phi Kappa Sigma and obtained his private pilot's license.

After graduating from Purdue in 1957, Chaffee completed his Navy pre-commissioning training, and was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)#United States|ensign]]. He began  pilot training at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]], Florida, flying a variety of planes including the [[Beechcraft T-34 Mentor|T-34]], [[North American T-28 Trojan|T-28]], and [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D]]. He became quality and safety control officer for [[VAP-62|Heavy Photographic Squadron 62]] (VAP-62). His time in this unit included taking crucial photos of Cuba during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], for which he was awarded the [[Air Medal]]. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]] on February 1, 1966.

Along with thirteen other pilots, Chaffee was selected to be an astronaut as part of [[NASA Astronaut Group 3]] in 1963. He served as [[capsule communicator]] (CAPCOM) for the [[Gemini 3]] and [[Gemini 4]] missions, and received his first spaceflight assignment in 1966. In 1967, he died in a fire along with fellow astronauts [[Gus Grissom|Virgil "Gus" Grissom]] and [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] during a pre-launch test for the [[Apollo 1]] mission at what was then the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34]], Florida. He was posthumously awarded the [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]] and a second Air Medal.

==Early life==
Roger Bruce Chaffee was born on February 15, 1935, in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]],&lt;ref name=astronautsmemorial/&gt; the second child of Donald Lynn Chaffee and Blanche May (Mike) Chaffee {{nee}} Mosher.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2008|p=136}} He had an older sister, Donna, born two years earlier.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=17}} In January 1935, in their hometown of [[Greenville, Michigan]], his father was diagnosed with [[scarlet fever]], and Mike moved in with her parents in Grand Rapids, where Roger was born. The family spent the next seven years in Greenville before moving to Grand Rapids, where his father took a job as the chief Army Ordnance inspector at the Doehler-Jarvis plant.&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov" /&gt; Chaffee interest in aerospace was sparked at a young age when his father, a former [[barnstorming]] pilot, took him on his first flight at the age of seven. Chaffee was thrilled by the flight, and soon after started building model airplanes with his father.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2008|p=135–136}}

=== Boy Scouts ===
Chaffee excelled as a [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]], earning his first [[Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|merit badge]] at the age of thirteen. He earned ten more badges that year. Many of these awards were typically earned by the older scouts.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|pp=32–33}} He continued his success by earning four additional badges at the age of fourteen.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=33}} He earned four badges for each of the next two years, and had earned almost all the badges available at the time. After becoming an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], he managed to earn another ten merit badges, for which he was awarded the bronze and gold palms.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=33}} Between his camping trips with his family and his involvement with the Boy Scouts, Chaffee developed a passion for the outdoors.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2008|p=136–137}}

=== Education ===
Chaffee attended the Dickinson School in Grand Rapids,{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2008|p=136}} and later graduated in the top fifth of his class from [[Central High School (Grand Rapids, Michigan)|Central High School]] in 1953.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=43}} Turning down a possible appointment to the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], he accepted a [[Naval ROTC|Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]] (NROTC) scholarship, and in September 1953 enrolled at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]. He performed well, making the [[Dean's list]] and finishing with a B+ average. While enrolled, he joined [[Phi Kappa Sigma]].&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/zorn/chaffee.htm|title=Detailed Biographies of Apollo I Crew - Roger Chaffee|last=White|first=Mary|publisher=NASA|access-date=June 3, 2016|date=August 4, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604142258/https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/zorn/chaffee.htm|archive-date=June 4, 2011|dead-url=no}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaffee was passionate about flying, and had a strong aptitude for science and engineering. To apply those talents, he transferred to [[Purdue University]] in the autumn of 1954 to attend the school's well-known [[aeronautical engineering]] program.&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt; Prior to his arrival in [[West Lafayette, Indiana|West Lafayette]], he reported for an 8-week tour on {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|6}} as a part of the NROTC program. To qualify, he had to finish training and pass additional tests. He initially failed the eye exam, but the physician allowed him to retake the test the next morning, and he passed. He was then allowed to tour on ''Wisconsin'' to England, Scotland, France, and Cuba. Upon his return to American soil, he worked as a gear cutter.&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt;

After starting classes at Purdue, Chaffee sought out a job to complement his coursework and involvement in the Phi Kappa Sigma social fraternity. His first job during his sophomore year was working as a server at one of the women's residences, but he disliked the job and sought new employment. He was hired as a [[draftsman]] at a local small business near Purdue. As a [[Junior (education)|junior]], he was hired as a teaching assistant in the Mathematics Department to teach classes to [[freshman]] students.&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt; He also joined the [[Tau Beta Pi]] and [[Sigma Gamma Tau]] engineering honor societies.&lt;ref name='chaffee space'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/chaffee-rb.html|title=Roger B. Chaffee|year=1997|publisher=Lyndon B.

In 1955, Chaffee took four flying lessons, but he did not have enough money to get his [[private pilot's license]]. Two years later, the NROTC sponsored flight training for him to become a [[naval aviator]]. He soloed on March 29, 1957 and obtained his private pilot's license on May 24, 1957.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2008|pp=138–139}} He earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree, with distinction, in Aeronautical Engineering at Purdue in 1957.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2008|p=140}}

=== Family ===
Chaffee met his future wife Martha Louise Horn on a double blind date in September 1955. They started dating, and he proposed to her on October 12, 1956. They married in [[Oklahoma City]], Martha's hometown, on August 24, 1957.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2008|pp=138–139}} Martha was a homemaker.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=67}} The couple had two children, Sheryl Lyn (born in 1958) and Stephen (born in 1961).&lt;ref name=spaceacts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceacts.com/STARSHIP/seh/chaffee.htm|title= Biographical Data|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307172656/http://spaceacts.com/starship/seh/chaffee.htm|archive-date=March 7, 2016|dead-url=yes|publisher=Space Acts|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Navy service==
[[File:Roger Chaffee Navy Portrait.jpg|thumb|Chaffee's Navy portrait]]
After graduation, Chaffee completed his Navy training on August 22, 1957, and was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]. Following his honeymoon, he reported to the aircraft carrier {{USS|Lake Champlain|CV-39|6}} for a six-week assignment in Norfolk with the Naval Air Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=70}} By the time Chaffee arrived at the base, the ship had already left port. He worked at the base until October 1957, when he attended flight school at the [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]], Florida.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2008|p=140}} He started his training by flying the [[North American T-28 Trojan|T-28]] and the [[Beechcraft T-34 Mentor|T-34]].{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=70}} He was posted to the [[Naval Air Station Kingsville]], Texas, from August 1958 to February 1959 as a part of Advanced Training Unit 212.&lt;ref name=navyhistory /&gt; In Kingsville, he trained on the [[F9F Cougar]] jet fighter.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=70}} His daughter Sheryl was born the day before he left for his first [[aircraft carrier]] training.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=71}} He was awarded his [[naval aviator]] [[United States Aviator Badge|wings]] in early 1959.&lt;ref name=astronautsmemorial/&gt;&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt;

Chaffee was transferred to [[Naval Air Station Jacksonville]], Florida, to continue his training. His first project was not flying, but repairing a [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D]] twin-engine jet photo reconnaissance plane.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=72}} This plane was typically flown by pilots with the rank of [[lieutenant commander]] or above, but since Chaffee became so familiar with the plane from repairing it, he became one of the youngest pilots ever to fly it.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=72}} He joined [[Second VA-44 (U.S. Navy)|Attack Squadron 44]] (VA-44) in September 1959, and from October 1959 to March 1960 he trained with [[RVAH-3|Reconnaissance  Attack Squadron (Heavy) 3]] (RVAH-3).&lt;ref name=navyhistory /&gt;

Chaffee was given a variety of assignments, and participated in numerous training duties over the next few years, spending most of his time in photo reconnaissance squadrons. He was stationed at NAS Jacksonville as safety officer and quality control officer for [[VAP-62|Heavy Photographic Squadron 62]] (VAP-62) flying the A3D.&lt;ref name=astronautsmemorial&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amfcse.org/roger-b-chafee|title=Roger B. Chaffee|publisher=Astronauts Memorial Foundation|access-date=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='chaffee space' /&gt; He wrote a quality control manual for the squadron, although some of his peers saw this as too demanding.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=74}} By coincidence, he was assigned to a mission where he flew over [[Cape Canaveral]], during which aerial photographs of future launch sites were taken.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=74}}

Between April 4, 1960, and October 25, 1962, including during the critical time of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], Chaffee flew 82 missions over Cuba, sometimes up to three per day, and achieved over 100 flight hours each month. Some of these trips included shuttling three men per plane back and forth to [[Guantanamo Bay]], including the pilot, co-pilot, and the photographer. He was awarded the [[Air Medal]].&lt;ref name=navyhistory /&gt;{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=75}} Some biographies credit him with flying the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] plane to spy on Cuba, but this is erroneous since he was a Navy pilot and the U-2 was an Air Force plane.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2008|p=140}}

After this, Chaffee undertook aircraft carrier flight training, including time spent on {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|6}} performing both day and night flights.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=75}} He said of day flying, "Setting that big bird down on the flight deck was like landing on a postage stamp"; and of night flying, "Getting catapulted off that flight deck at night is like getting shot into a bottle of ink!"{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=75}} While working in Jacksonville, he concurrently worked on a [[master's degree]].{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=75}} He was on a cruise to Africa when his son Stephen was born in Oklahoma City.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=76}}

During Chaffee's Navy service he logged more than 2,300 hours flying time, including more than 2,000 hours in jet aircraft.&lt;ref name=astronautsmemorial/&gt;&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt; On February 1, 1966, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]].&lt;ref name=navyhistory&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/biographies-list/bios-c/Chaffee-Roger/Chaffee-Roger-Text.html|title=Roger Bruce Chaffee|access-date=September 18, 2016|date=March 3, 2016|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023172132/https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/biographies-list/bios-c/Chaffee-Roger/Chaffee-Roger-Text.html|archive-date=October 23, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection===
In August 1962, Chaffee confided in his family that he had submitted an application for the [[NASA]] [[astronaut]] training program, and informed his superiors he wanted to train as a [[test pilot]] for astronaut status.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=78}} In mid-1962, he was accepted in the initial pool of 1,800 applicants for the third group of [[NASA]] astronauts.&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt;{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=79}} After his naval tour was over, and he had racked up over 1,800 hours of flying time, the Navy offered him the opportunity to continue work on his master's degree.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=79}} In January 1963, he entered the U.S. [[Air Force Institute of Technology]] (AFIT) at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], to work on his [[Master of Science]] degree in [[Reliability Engineering]].&lt;ref name='chaffee space' /&gt;

While at AFIT, Chaffee continued to participate in astronaut candidate testing as the pool of candidates dropped to 271 in mid-1963. It was noted during testing that he had a very small lung capacity, but that he used it better than most people with greater capacity.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=82}} He returned from a hunting trip to [[Fairborn, Ohio]], on October 14, 1963, when he found a message from NASA in [[Houston]], Texas.{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=82}} He called them back, and discovered he had been chosen as an astronaut.&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt; On October 18, 1963, it was officially announced that he was one of fourteen chosen for [[Astronaut Group 3]].&lt;ref name=astronautsmemorial/&gt; He said, "I was very pleased with the appointment. I've always wanted to fly and perform adventurous flying tasks all my life. Ever since the first [[Mercury Seven|seven Mercury astronauts]] were named, I've been keeping my studies up."{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=85}}

===Training===
[[File:Apollo 1 astronauts Edward H. White II and Roger B. Chaffee during water egress training.jpg|thumb|Chaffee (sitting on hatch sill) during water egress training for Apollo 1]]
Phase one of training for the third group of astronauts began in 1964 in lecture halls. Lectures in several fields were supplemented with trips to locations with geological significance so the astronauts gained hands-on experience. In addition to piloting the spacecraft, the astronauts would also perform scientific experiments and measurements on the Moon. The astronauts traveled from the [[Grand Canyon]] to learn about geography all the way to Alaska, Iceland, and Hawaii to learn about rock formations and lava flows.&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt;

The second phase was contingency training, which focused on astronauts learning the skills required to survive if the landing did not occur where planned. The group started their training by being dropped off in the middle of the jungle in Panama. They performed the survival training in pairs, carrying only their parachutes and survival kits. Chaffee, with help from his Boy Scout training, foraged for enough food to survive during the three-day training mission. Following the jungle training, the astronauts traveled to an entirely different environment: the desert of [[Reno, Nevada]]. For clothing, the astronauts had only long underwear, shoes, and robes they manufactured from their parachutes. Lizards and snakes were the main source of food, and the astronauts used their parachutes as makeshift tents for shelter for the two days of desert training.&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt;

The third and final phase was operational training for the astronauts. This focused on giving them hands-on experience using the instruments and equipment required during their spaceflight. They received training in the effects of [[microgravity]] and rapid [[acceleration]]. The astronauts spent time in simulators, aboard cargo planes that simulated weightlessness, underwater to practice [[extravehicular activity|extravehicular activities]] (EVAs), and on visits to manufacturing plants to check on the progress of the hardware.&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt;

===Project Gemini===
[[File:Roger B. Chaffee at a console in the Mission Control Center, Houston, during the Gemini-Titan 3 flight.jpg|thumb|Chaffee at the consoles in Mission Control during the [[Gemini 3]] mission]]
Every astronaut was required to have a specialty, and Chaffee's specialty was communications. He focused on the Deep Space Instrumentation Facility (DSIF), which the astronauts needed for navigation in space.{{sfn|Burgess|Doolan|Vis|2008|p=142}}

At the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]] in Houston, Chaffee served as [[capsule communicator]] (CAPCOM) in March 1965 for [[Gemini 3]].&lt;ref name=ksc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/gemini/gemini-3/gemini-3.html|title=Gemini 3 (3)|access-date=September 20, 2016|date=August 25, 2000|publisher=Kennedy Space Center: Science, Technology, and Engineering|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65r4RZ0Rq?url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/gemini/gemini-3/gemini-3.html|archive-date=March 2, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he was CAPCOM, along with [[Gus Grissom|Virgil "Gus" Grissom]] and [[Eugene Cernan]], for the [[Gemini 4]] mission, in which [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] performed the first spacewalk by an American.&lt;ref name=astronautsmemorial/&gt;&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt; As CAPCOM, Chaffee relayed information between the crew members and the Director of Flight Operations, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr.|Chris Kraft]].&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt; He never got a seat on a [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] mission, but was assigned to work on flight control, communications, instrumentation, and attitude and translation control systems in the [[Apollo program]].&lt;ref name='chaffee space' /&gt; During this time, along with Grissom, he also flew chase planes at an altitude of between {{convert|30,000|and|50,000|ft}} to take motion pictures of the launch of an unmanned [[Saturn 1B]] rocket.&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt;{{sfn|Chrysler|Chaffee|1968|p=108}}

===Apollo program===
[[File:Apollo1-Crew 01.jpg|thumb|Apollo 1 crew, [[Gus Grissom|Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|White]], and Chaffee]]
Chaffee received his first spaceflight assignment in January 1966, when he was selected for the first manned Apollo-Saturn flight, AS-204. Joining Command Pilot Grissom and Senior Pilot White, he replaced the injured [[Donn F. Eisele]] in the third-ranked Pilot position. Eisele required surgery for a dislocated shoulder, which he sustained aboard the [[reduced gravity aircraft|KC-135 weightlessness training aircraft]]. He was reassigned to a second Apollo crew, commanded by [[Wally Schirra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/vintage-space/how-donn-eisele-became-whatshisname-command-module-pilot-apollo-7|title=How Donn Eisele Became "Whatshisname," the Command Module Pilot of Apollo 7|last = Teitel|first = Amy Shira | publisher= Popular Science| date = December 4, 2013|access-date=June 5, 2016| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150422020339/http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/vintage-space/how-donn-eisele-became-whatshisname-command-module-pilot-apollo-7|archivedate =April 22, 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew announcement was made public on March 21, 1966. The two-week flight of Apollo 1 was not only to test the spacecraft systems, but also the ground tracking and control facilities.&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt; While Chaffee had monitored the manufacture of the [[Gemini (spacecraft)|Gemini spacecraft]], he had not witnessed the building of the Apollo spacecraft. Three days after being selected for the Apollo 1 crew, he flew out to the [[North American Aviation]] Plant in Downey, California, to see it.&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt;

[[File:Apollo 1 fire.jpg|thumb|Charred remains of the Apollo 1 [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]], in which Chaffee was killed along with Gus Grissom and Ed White]]
On January 27, 1967, Grissom, White and Chaffee were participating in a "plugs-out" countdown demonstration test at [[Cape Kennedy]] in preparation for the planned February 21 launch. Chaffee was sitting at the right side of the cabin.&lt;ref name="history.nasa.gov"/&gt; His main role was to maintain communications with the [[blockhouse]]. A momentary power surge was detected at 23:30:55 GMT, which was believed to accompany an electrical short in equipment located on the lower left side of the cabin, the presumed ignition source for the fire.{{sfn|Thompson|Borman|Faget|White|1967|p=5-10}} At 23:31:04 GMT, a voice was heard declaring, "[We]'ve got a fire in the cockpit." Most investigative listeners believe that voice was Chaffee's.{{sfn|Thompson|Borman|Faget|White|1967|p=5-8}}

Assigned emergency roles called for Grissom, in the left-hand seat, to open the cabin pressure vent valve, after which White in the center seat was to open the [[plug door]] hatch, while Chaffee in the right-hand seat was to maintain communications. Grissom was prevented from opening the valve by the intensity of the fire, which started in that region and spread from left to right. Despite this, White removed his restraints and apparently tried in vain to open the hatch, which was held closed by the cabin pressure. The increasing pressure finally burst the inner cabin wall on the right-hand side at 23:31:19 GMT. After approximately thirty seconds of being fed by a cabin atmosphere of pure [[oxygen]] at pressures of {{convert|16.7|to|29|psi|abbr=on}}, and now fed by nitrogen-buffered ambient air, the primary fire decreased in intensity and started producing large amounts of smoke,{{sfn|Thompson|Borman|Faget|White|1967|pp=5-3–5-4}} which killed the astronauts. Chaffee lost consciousness when he experienced [[myocardial hypoxia]], which sent him into [[cardiac arrest]] and resulted in [[cerebral hypoxia]]. He died from [[asphyxia]] due to the toxic gasses from the fire, with burns contributing to his death.{{sfn|Thompson|Borman|Faget|White|1967|pp=5-9, 6-1}}

Failed oxygen and [[ethylene glycol]] pipes near the fire's origin point continued burning an intense secondary fire which melted through the cabin floor.{{sfn|Thompson|Borman|Faget|White|1967|p=5-4}} By the time firefighters were able to open the hatch, the fire had extinguished itself. The back of Chaffee's couch was found in the horizontal position, with the lower portion angled towards the floor. His helmet was closed and locked, his restraints were undone, and the hoses and electrical connections to the suit remained connected.{{sfn|Thompson|Borman|Faget|White|1967|p=4-7}} As he was farthest from the origin of the fire, he suffered the least burn and suit damage.{{sfn|Thompson|Borman|Faget|White|1967|p=5-3}}

===Aftermath===

The atmosphere in the cabin was changed from 100% oxygen to a 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen environment at launch. The astronauts' spacesuits, originally made of [[nylon]], were changed to [[beta cloth]], a non-flammable, highly melt-resistant fabric woven from [[fiberglass]] and coated with [[teflon]]. There were other changes, including replacing flammable cabin materials with self extinguishing ones, and covering plumbing and wiring with protective insulation.&lt;ref name="chariot"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch9-4.html|title= The Slow Recovery|last1= Brooks|first1= Courtney|last2= Grimwood|first2= James|last3= Swenson|first3= Loyd|date= 1979|publisher= NASA|access-date= July 9, 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161106010826/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch9-4.html|archive-date= November 6, 2016|dead-url= no|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 a life-size bronze statue of Chaffee was inaugurated in his hometown. The statue was unveiled at the northwest corner of East Fulton Street and Sheldon Avenue NE outside of the [[Grand Rapids Children's Museum]]. Chaffee's family, including his wife Martha Horn Chafee, and [[Skylab 3]] and [[Space Shuttle]] astronaut [[Jack Lousma]], also a Grand Rapids native, were present for the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wzzm13.com/article/news/local/grand-rapids-central/enshrined-astronaut-roger-b-chaffee-statue-unveiled-in-grand-rapids/69-556125583|title=Enshrined: Astronaut Roger B.

[[File:Ronald Bunting.jpg|thumb|right|Ronald Bunting circa 1960s]]

Major '''Ronald Terence Bunting''' (1924&amp;ndash;1984)&lt;ref&gt;W.D. Flackes &amp; S. Elliott, ''Northern Ireland: A Political Directory 1968-1993'', Belfast: Blackstaff Press, 1994, p. 108&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[British Army]] officer and [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] political figure in [[Northern Ireland]]. 

Bunting was commissioned into the [[County Armagh|Armagh]]  and [[County Down|Down]] [[Army Cadet Force]] in May 1946 and resigned in March 1950 when he transferred to the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] as a [[lieutenant]]. He was promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in 1952 and retired with the honorary rank of [[major]] in 1960. After leaving the army he worked as a mathematics lecturer in the [[Belfast College of Technology]].&lt;ref name="Boulton"/&gt;

Bunting's first involvement with politics was as election agent to [[Republican Labour Party]] MP [[Gerry Fitt]],&lt;ref name="Boulton"&gt;David Boulton, ''The UVF, 1966-73: An Anatomy of Loyalist Rebellion'', Gill and Macillan, 1973, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ciaran McKeown, ''The Passion of Peace'', Blackstaff Press, 1984, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; although he broke from Fitt and became a close associate of [[Ian Paisley]], playing a leading role in Paisley's campaigns against the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]], as well as running unsuccessfully for the [[Protestant Unionist Party]] in the [[Northern Ireland general election, 1969|Northern Ireland general election of 1969]] in [[Belfast Victoria (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Belfast Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/stormont/belfast.html Northern Ireland Parliamentary Elections Results: Boroughs: Belfast]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bunting had his own [[Ulster loyalist]] strong-arm group which he dubbed the ''Loyal Citizens of Ulster''. The LCU, which existed between 1968 and 1969, was little more than another name for the East [[Belfast]] arm of the [[Ulster Protestant Volunteers]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barberis, John McHugh &amp; Mike Tyldesley, ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations'', p. 233&lt;!--ISBN needed; year of publication needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As head of this group, Bunting led the protests against many civil rights marches, most notably the 1969 [[Belfast]] to [[Derry]] [[civil rights]] march organised by [[People's Democracy (Ireland)|People's Democracy]], which resulted in a [[Burntollet bridge incident|particularly bloody confrontation at Burntollet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/pdmarch/egan.htm CAIN: "Burntollet" by Bowes Egan and Vincent McCormack], cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 26 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In a fiery court case in 1969, Bunting was sentenced to three months' imprisonment along with Paisley for his role in [[1969 Northern Ireland Riots|the disturbances]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/the_hitch/article856629.ece "On This Day"], ''The Times'', 28 January 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bunting's son [[Ronnie Bunting|Ronnie]] would go on to serve as a member of the [[Official Irish Republican Army]] and the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] before he was shot dead by the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA) in 1980. Following his son's death, Major Bunting took no further role in politics but later told an inquest he felt his son was killed because of his belief in [[social justice]].&lt;ref name="DirtyWar"&gt;Martin Dillon (1991), ''The Dirty War''.

'''Roimata''' was a powerful 13th century [[Melanesia]]n  chief from what is now [[Vanuatu]]. His elaborate grave, containing the bodies of over 25 members of his retinue, was discovered by French [[archaeologist]] Jose Garranger in 1967 and inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] in 2008. Garranger was able to locate the grave on [[Eretoka]] island by analyzing local folklore. According to legend, when Roy Mata conquered the land, his first goal was to unite the tribes.

His reign is reputed to have been a peaceful one. Roy Mata was fatally poisoned by his brother. His body was not buried in his homeland and his name was not used in future generations because the locals feared his spirit.

In 2008, three sites associated with Roy Mata, on the islands of [[Efate]], [[Lelepa island (Vanuatu)|Lelepa]] and [[Eretoka]], were made [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1280/ "Chief Roi Mata’s Domain"], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RNZI_40819"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=40819 |title=World Heritage Status set to ensure protection of Vanuatu’s Roi Mata domain |date=July 9, 2008 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis''' ('''SPT''')  is a postpartum complication which consists of a persistent [[postpartum fever]] that is not responsive to [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]]s in which [[Pelvis|pelvic]] [[infection]] leads to infection of the [[vein]] wall and intimal damage leading to [[Thrombogenicity|thrombogenesis]] in the ovarian veins (left or right, although right is more common due to dextroversion of the uterus). The thrombus is then invaded by [[microorganism]]s.  Ascending infections cause 99% of postpartum SPT.

Septic pelvis thrombophlembitis is a cause of post-operative fever from untreated postpartum endometritis. After 48 hours of uncured postpartum endometritis  (notably 48 hours of fever that is unaffected by antibiotics), one could diagnose SPT until proven otherwise (with pelvic radiography).  Imaging studies can be helpful in patient refractory to broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics to look for an abscess, retained products, or septic pelvic thrombophlebitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blueprint Obstetrics and Gynecology|last=Callaghan|first=Tamara|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Septic pelvic thrombophlembitis (SPT) occurs most often in bedridden patients after giving birth, or after having undergone a [[Caesarean section]]. The blood often pools in the pelvis as this is the lowest part of the patient while laying in a hospital bed.

== Risk factors ==
The main risk factor of developing SPT is post-partum endometritis, which in turn is most commonly caused by a [[Caesarean section]]. Other risk factors for developing endometritis, and subsequently SPT include:
* [[Bacterial vaginosis]]
* Manual removal of the placenta
* Prolonged labor
* Large amount of [[meconium]] in amniotic fluid
* Multiple cervical examinations

== Symptoms ==
The symptoms of septic pelvic thrombophlebitis are similar to those of endometritis. Clinical signs include:
* fever
* pain on palpation of uterus
* midline lower abdominal pain
* malodorous [[lochia]] (vaginal discharge)
* tachycardia

== Laboratory results ==
Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis will have elevated [[C-reactive protein|CRP]] and WBC (evidence of inflammation).

== Diagnosis ==
Since septic pelvic thrombophlebitis is a diagnosis of exclusion, other causes of postpartum fever must be considered, such as infection of cesarean section wounds, episiotomy or laceration sites as well as endometritis, endomyometritis, mastitis, and physiologic breast engorgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blueprints Obstetrics and Gynecology|last=Callaghan|first=Tamara|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4511-1702-8|location=Baltimore|pages=237|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
With low uterine size retention, treat endometritis and SPT with ice packs, broad-spectrum antibiotics and analgesics.

With high uterine size retention, treat the thrombophlebitis with D&amp;C aspiration under ultrasonogram because of increased risk of placental tissue retention in the myometrium.

'''Sputnik 2''' ({{IPA-ru|ˈsputʲnʲɪk}}, {{lang-ru|Спутник-2}}, ''Satellite 2''), or '''Prosteyshiy Sputnik 2''' ('''PS-2''', {{lang-ru|Простейший Спутник 2|italic=yes}}, ''Elementary Satellite 2'') was the second [[spacecraft]] launched into [[Earth orbit]], on 3 November 1957, and the first to carry a living animal, a [[Soviet space dogs|Soviet space dog]] named [[Laika]], who died a few hours after the launch.&lt;ref name="AT-20171103"&gt;{{cite news |last=Berger |first=Eric |title=The first creature in space was a dog. She died miserably 60 years ago |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/sixty-years-ago-the-first-creature-went-into-space-a-stray-moscow-dog/ |date=3 November 2017 |work=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=3 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Launched by the [[Soviet Union|U.S.S.R.]], Sputnik 2 was a 4-meter (13&amp;nbsp;foot) high cone-shaped capsule with a base diameter of 2 meters (6.6&amp;nbsp;feet) that weighed around 500&amp;nbsp;kg, though it was not designed to separate from the rocket core that brought it to orbit, bringing the total mass in orbit to 7.79 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.russianspaceweb.com/sputnik2_design.html|title = Russian Space Web|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained several compartments for [[radio transmitter]]s, a [[telemetry]] system, a programming unit, a regeneration and [[temperature control|temperature-control]] system for the cabin, and scientific instruments. A separate sealed cabin contained the dog [[Laika]].

Engineering and [[biological data]] were transmitted using the Tral D telemetry system, transmitting data to Earth for a 15-minute period during each orbit. Two photometers were on board for measuring solar radiation ([[ultraviolet]] and [[x-ray]] emissions) and cosmic rays. A 100 line television camera provided images of Laika.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1957-002A |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610173508/https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1957-002A |archive-date=2017-06-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sputnik 2 was launched into space only 32 days after its predecessor [[Sputnik 1]]. Due to the huge success of Sputnik 1, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] ordered [[Sergei Korolev|Sergey Korolev]] back to work creating a Sputnik 2 that needed to be ready for space for the 40th anniversary of the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik revolution]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reconsidering Sputnik: Forty years since the Soviet satellite|last=Logsdon|first=Launius|publisher=Hardwood Academic|year=2000|isbn=90-5702-623-6|location=Australia|pages=86, 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sputnik 2 was part of an idea that included [[Sputnik 1]] that came from Korolev that was approved in January 1957. At that time, it was not clear that the Soviets' main satellite plan (which would eventually become [[Sputnik 3]]) would be able to get to space because of the ongoing issues with the R-7 ICBM, which would be needed to launch a satellite of that size. “Korolev proposed substituting two 'simple satellites' for the [[International Geophysical Year|IGY]] satellite”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The choice to launch these two instead of waiting for the more advanced Sputnik 3 to be finished was largely motivated by the desire to launch a satellite to orbit before the US.

Sputnik 2, known to Korolev's design bureau as "Prosteyshiy Sputnik-2", meaning "Simple Satellite 2",&lt;ref&gt;Siddiqi, Asif A.. ''Sputnik and the Soviet Space Challenge'', Gainesville, Florida.  The University of Florida Press, 2003, p. 155. {{ISBN|0-8130-2627-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was launched into a 212 × 1660&amp;nbsp;km (132 × 1031&amp;nbsp;mi) orbit with a period of 103.7 minutes on a modified [[ICBM]] [[R-7 rocket|R-7]], similar to the one used to launch [[Sputnik 1]].

Sputnik 2's launch vehicle had several modifications for the mission. These included modifying the launch trajectory to utilize propellant more efficiently and removing some flight control components to reduce weight. In addition, the core stage would be burned to propellant depletion instead of cutting off at a preset time. The telemetry system at engine cutoff would be switched from monitoring the booster's parameters to those of the capsule. It was also designed to only transmit data for ten minutes at a time every 90 minutes, so as to prevent battery power from being used up sending data while the spacecraft was out of range of Soviet tracking stations. The interstage section between the booster and capsule was highly polished and equipped with thermal blankets so as to reflect off sunlight and keep the latter cool, also several deployable reflectors were mounted on the core stage. A braking nozzle was added to the core stage to prevent it from tumbling in orbit; this would work by venting excess [[helium]] gas from the propellant tank pressurization system. Several RD-107 engines were test-fired, with the best-performing units being selected for use on Sputnik 2's booster. The launch vehicle arrived at Baikonur on October 22, along with various parts of the capsule. On November 1, the booster was erected on LC-1.

Ten dogs were considered for the mission, with the final selection being narrowed down to three, Laika being the flight animal, Albina the backup, and Muhka, used to test equipment.

Liftoff took place at about 5:30 PM Moscow time on November 3. Booster performance was nominal and the command to terminate core stage thrust was issued at T+297 seconds, just as onboard sensors detected LOX depletion. The booster and capsule entered a {{convert|225|x|1671|km|abbr=on}} orbit at a 65 degree inclination.

During the first two orbits, it proved difficult to reliably track Sputnik 2's flight path, but ground controllers were able to intercept theodolite data from an American tracking station in [[Perth, Australia]]. Data showed that Laika's heart rate and breathing spiked rapidly during ascent, but she otherwise reached orbit largely unscathed. Official Soviet press releases stated that Laika survived a week in orbit, but information released in the post-Soviet era indicated that she died only a few hours into the mission. Other sources suggested it had been four days before the dog succumbed to overheating and [[carbon dioxide]] buildup.

Telemetry data indicated that Laika's vital signs were normal for the first three orbits, but during the fourth orbit, the cabin temperature rose to {{convert|43|C|abbr=on}} followed by movements of the dog. Data received on the second day showed no signs of breathing, heart rate, or blood pressure, but the cardio sensor was still registering a heart beat. By the morning of November 6, there were no signs of life in the capsule. On November 10, the batteries in the spacecraft ran out and all data transmission ceased, after 150 separate telemetry sessions. Sputnik 2 reentered the atmosphere on April 14, 1958 after 162 days in space and about 2500 orbits. Reentry was sighted from the east coast of the United States and surviving debris impacted in the Amazon region of South America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.russianspaceweb.com/sputnik2_mission.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The flight sparked considerable ethical debate about cruelty to animals, as Laika had been launched with the full knowledge that she could not be recovered and may have suffered a quite unpleasant death from panic and overheating, and even some Soviet space program officials reportedly felt sorry about it. An anonymously-written poem criticizing the mission and the Soviet state was circulated in Moscow.

This allowed the core's Tral D telemetry system to be used to transmit data, but would lead to speculation that Sputnik 2 had failed to separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.russianspaceweb.com/sputnik2_decision.html|title = Russian Space Web|date = 3 November 2012|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Sputnik 2 reached orbit, the interior temperature rapidly climbed to over 40&amp;nbsp;°C (100&amp;nbsp;°F), and Laika survived for only a few hours instead of the planned ten days.&lt;ref&gt;Siddiqi, Asif A..

{{main|Laika}}

The first living creature (larger than a microbe) to enter orbit was a female [[mongrel]] originally named ''Kudryavka'' (Little Curly), but later renamed ''Laika'' ("Barker"). Her true pedigree is unknown, although it is generally accepted that she was part husky or other Nordic breed, and possibly part [[terrier]]. NASA refers to Laika as a "part-[[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]] terrier".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1957-002A Sputnik 2] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6cII5dKQs?url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1957-002A |date=2015-10-15 }}. National Space Science Data Center. Accessed April 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Laika was selected from ten candidates at the [[Air Force Institute of Aviation Medicine]], because of her even temperament.&lt;ref name="Siddiqi, Asif A. 2003, p. 173"&gt;Siddiqi, Asif A.. ''Sputnik and the Soviet Space Challenge'', Gainesville, Florida.  The University of Florida Press, 2003, p. 173. {{ISBN|0-8130-2627-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; She weighed about 6&amp;nbsp;kg (13&amp;nbsp;lbs).

The pressurized cabin on Sputnik 2 was padded and allowed enough room for Laika to lie down or stand. An air regeneration system provided oxygen; food and water were dispensed in a gelatinized form. Laika was chained in place and fitted with a [[safety harness|harness]], a bag to collect waste, and [[electrode]]s to monitor vital signs.

Early [[telemetry]] indicated Laika was agitated but alive and well, although the cabin temperature had already reached 43&amp;nbsp;°C (109&amp;nbsp;°F) by the third orbit. Biometric telemetry failed sometime after the fourth orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://mentallandscape.com/S_Sputnik2.htm|title = Sputnik-2|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially claimed that Laika had survived in orbit for a week; decades later, Russian sources revealed that Laika likely had survived only a few hours in orbit before dying from [[hyperthermia|overheating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.russianspaceweb.com/sputnik2_mission.html|title = Russian Space Web|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission provided scientists with the first data on the behavior of a living organism in the space environment.&lt;ref&gt;Chernov, V. N., and V. I. Yakovlev, Scientific research during the flight of an animal in an artificial earth satellite, Artif. Earth Satell., No. 1, 80-94, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; Although the time between Sputniks 1 and 2 was only 32 days, the plan to launch a dog was in the works more than a year in advance. The Soviets already had significant experience launching dogs in high altitude rockets, and they used that experience when ordered to quickly get Sputnik 2 into space.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/sputnik2.html|title=Sputnik 2|last=Zak|first=Anatoly|date=|website=Russian Space Web|publisher=|access-date=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
The time after Sputnik 2 was tense for the Americans and exciting for the Soviets. The day after Sputnik 2 went into orbit the [[Gaither Report|Gaither committee]] met with [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] to brief him on the current situation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cox |first=Donald W. |year=1962 |title=The space race; from Sputnik to Apollo, and beyond |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Chilton Books |lccn=62018224 |pages=26, 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee, like much of the U.S., seemed to be in a panic, afraid that they were falling so far behind the Soviets technologically that it would put them in danger of a strike using nuclear weapons.

Unlike most of the U.S., President Eisenhower kept calm through the time afterward just as he did after Sputnik 1 was launched. According to one of the president's aides, “The president's burning concern was to keep the country from going hog-wild and from embarking on foolish, costly schemes.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; And by this he was referring to the push from the Gaither committee and others to invest in creating nuclear fallout shelters.

In the U.S.S.R., just six days after the launch of Sputnik 2, on the 40th anniversary of the October revolution, Khrushchev boasted in a speech “Now our first Sputnik is not lonely in its space travels.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Sputnik 2 and the Van Allen radiation belt==
The [[Van Allen radiation belt]] could have received the name "Vernov Belt" after {{ill|S.N. Vernov|ru|Вернов, Сергей Николаевич}} from [[Moscow State University]]. Sputnik 2 detected the Earth's [[Van Allen radiation belt|outer radiation belt]] in the far northern latitudes, but researchers did not immediately realize the significance of the elevated radiation because Sputnik 2 passed through the Van Allen belt too far out of range of the Soviet tracking stations.

In Australia, Professor [[Harry Messel]] intercepted the signals. Other stations in Australia and South America had also been in range and intercepted the signals. However, the Soviets would not release the code that would allow the stations in Australia and South America to read the signals, and without the code, the stations would not cooperate and send the data to the Soviets.

The disagreement cost the Soviets the opportunity to claim one of the most significant findings of the space race at that time, and only after the launch (31 January 1958) of the U.S. satellite [[Explorer 1]] did [[James Van Allen]] demonstrate the existence of the radiation belts.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1958, with [[Sputnik 3]], they began to cooperate, and they confirmed the findings of the U.S. satellites Explorer 1, [[Explorer 3|3]], and [[Explorer 4|4]].

== Reentry ==
Sputnik 2 reentered the Earth's atmosphere on 14 April 1958, at approximately 0200 hrs, on a line that stretched from New York to the Amazon. Its track was plotted by British ships and 3 "Moon Watch Observations", from New York. It was said to be glowing and did not develop a tail until it was at latitudes south of 20 degrees North. Estimates put the average length of the tail at about {{convert|50|nmi}}. The satellite burned up in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=King-Heele, D.G.; Walker, D.M.C.|date=1958-08-16|title=The Last Minutes of Satellite 1957β (Sputnik 2)|journal=Nature|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Kanumba was born into a [[Sukuma people|Sukuma]] family in the [[Shinyanga Region]] in Northern Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.kanumba.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=2|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Charles Kanumba and his mother was Flora Mutegoa.&lt;ref name=fresh&gt;{{cite news|title=Fresh revelations in Kanumba death probe|url=http://thecitizen.co.tz/news/4-national-news/21356-fresh-revelations-in-kanumba-death-probe.html|accessdate=10 April 2012|newspaper=The Citizen Daily|date=9 April 2012|author=Songa wa Songa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanumba had three older sisters. He began his studies at Bugoyi Primary School and continued with his secondary studies at Mwadui Secondary School, later transferring to Vosa Mission Secondary School. He joined Jitegemee High School for his high level education. He spoke three languages fluently: [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Sukuma language|Sukuma]] and English.

==Career==
Kanumba began acting in the 1990s in church productions. In 2002, he joined the theater group Kaole Arts Group. He appeared in the television soap operas ''Jahazi'' and ''Dira'' and made his film debut in ''Haviliki''. In 2006 he met Nazz who gave him advice and further connections for his career. He appeared in ''Dar 2 Lagos'', a film by Mtitu Game that used both Tanzanian and Nigerian actors and crew.&lt;ref name=p86&gt;{{cite book|last=Saur|first=Mahir|title=Viewing African Cinema in the Twenty-First Century: Art Films and the Nollywood Video Revolution|page=86|date=2010|publisher=Ohio University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cH0DaVXW0JMC&amp;dq=Steven+Kanumba&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in the films ''She is My Sister'', ''This Is It'', and ''Love Gamble''. In 2009, he was a special celebrity guest on ''[[Big Brother Africa (season 4)|Big Brother Africa 4]]''.

In 2011, Kanumba was named an [[Oxfam]] GROW Ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Steven Kanumba on Oxfam's GROW campaign in Tanzania|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSPSS4QEeU8|accessdate=10 April 2012|newspaper=Oxfam East Africa|date=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his death he had been preparing for his first [[Hollywood]] film role,&lt;ref name=fresh/&gt; although he was already "Tanzania's most popular film star"&lt;ref name=thousands /&gt; and appeared in [[Nollywood]] films.

'''Thinking outside the box''' (also '''thinking out of the box'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/box|title=box - definition of box in English - Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/think-outside-the-box?showCookiePolicy=true|title=think outside the box - Definition, meaning &amp; more - Collins Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''thinking beyond the box''' and, especially in [[Australian English|Australia]],&lt;!-- some examples of the use of this phrase in australia can be found at:http://cottonaustralia.com.au/news/article/photographers-encouraged-to-think-outside-the-square-in-cotton-photo-comp and http://www.companydirectors.com.au/director-resource-centre/publications/company-director-magazine/2012-back-editions/october/feature-thinking-outside-the-square in addition to the aussi_example ref--&gt; '''thinking outside the square'''&lt;ref name="aussi_example"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/features/thinking-outside-square|title=Thinking Outside The Square|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a metaphor that means to think differently, unconventionally, or from a new perspective.  This phrase often refers to novel or creative thinking. The term is thought to derive from management consultants in the 1970s and 1980s challenging their clients to solve the "nine dots" puzzle, whose solution requires some [[lateral thinking]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This phrase can also be found commonly in dance, as encouragement to move creatively, beyond simple, geometric box steps and their basic variations, to literally step outside the box into more complex patterns of expression.

The [[catchphrase]], or [[cliché]], has become widely used in business environments, especially by [[management consultant]]s and executive coaches, and has been referenced in a number of [[advertising slogan]]s. To think outside the box is to look further and to try not thinking of the obvious things, but to try thinking of the things beyond them.

==Analogy==
A simplified definition for ''[[paradigm]]'' is a habit of reasoning or a [[conceptual framework]].

A simplified analogy is "the box" in the commonly used phrase "thinking outside the box". What is encompassed by the words "inside the box" is analogous with the current, and often unnoticed, assumptions about a situation. Creative thinking acknowledges and rejects the accepted paradigm to come up with new ideas.

== Nine dots puzzle ==
The notion of something outside a perceived "box" is related to a traditional [[topography|topographical]] [[puzzle]] called the ''nine dots puzzle''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kihn, Martin. [http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/95/debunk.html "'Outside the Box': the Inside Story,"] ''FastCompany'' 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the phrase "thinking outside the box" are obscure; but it was popularized in part because of a nine-dot puzzle, which [[John Adair (author)|John Adair]] claims to have introduced in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Adair | first = John | title = The art of creative thinking how to be innovative and develop great ideas | publisher = Kogan Page | location = London Philadelphia | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780749452186 | page = 127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Management consultant]] Mike Vance has claimed that the use of the nine-dot puzzle in consultancy circles stems from the [[corporate culture]] of the [[Walt Disney Company]], where the puzzle was used in-house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativethinkingassoc.com/mikevance.html Biography of Mike Vance] at Creative Thinking Association of America.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eggpuzzle.jpg|thumb|''Christopher Columbus's Egg Puzzle'' as it appeared in [[Sam Loyd]]'s ''Cyclopedia of Puzzles''.]]
The nine dots puzzle is much older than the slogan. It appears in [[Sam Loyd]]'s 1914 ''Cyclopedia of Puzzles''.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Loyd, ''Cyclopedia of Puzzles''. (The Lamb Publishing Company, 1914)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1951 compilation ''The Puzzle-Mine: Puzzles Collected from the Works of the Late [[Henry Ernest Dudeney]]'', the puzzle is attributed to Dudeney himself.&lt;ref&gt;J. Travers, ''The Puzzle-Mine: Puzzles Collected from the Works of the Late Henry Ernest Dudeney''. (Thos. Nelson, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt;  Sam Loyd's original formulation of the puzzle&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathpuzzle.com/loyd/cop300-301.html Facsimile from ''Cyclopedia of Puzzles'' - Columbus's Egg Puzzle is on right-hand page]&lt;/ref&gt; entitled it as "[[Christopher Columbus]]'s egg puzzle."  This was an allusion to the story of [[Egg of Columbus]].

[[File:Ninedots.svg|thumb|upright=.5|One of many solutions to the puzzle at the beginning of this article.]]
The puzzle proposed an intellectual challenge&amp;mdash;to connect the dots by drawing four straight, continuous lines that pass through each of the nine dots, and never lifting the pencil from the paper.  The [[:wikt:conundrum|conundrum]] is easily resolved, but only by drawing the lines outside the confines of the square area defined by the nine dots themselves.  The phrase "thinking outside the box" is a restatement of the solution strategy.  The puzzle only seems difficult because people commonly imagine [[Convex hull|a boundary around the edge]] of the dot array.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kies, [http://papyr.com/hypertextbooks/comp2/9dots.htm  "English Composition 2: Assumptions: Puzzle of the Nine Dots"], retr. Jun. 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The heart of the matter is the unspecified barrier that people typically perceive.

Telling people to "think outside the box" does not help them think outside the box, at least not with the 9-dot problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maier|first1=Norman R. F.|last2=Casselman|first2=Gertrude G. |title=Locating the Difficulty in Insight Problems: Individual and Sex Differences|journal=Psychological Reports|date=1 February 1970|volume=26|issue=1|pages=103–117|doi=10.2466/pr0.1970.26.1.103}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the distinction between [[procedural knowledge]] (implicit or [[tacit knowledge]]) and [[declarative knowledge]] (book knowledge). For example, a non-verbal cue such as drawing a square outside the 9 dots does allow people to solve the 9-dot problem better than average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lung|first=Ching-tung|author2=Dominowski, Roger L. |title=Effects of strategy instructions and practice on nine-dot problem solving.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=1 January 1985|volume=11|issue=4|pages=804–811|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.11.1-4.804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nine-dot problem is a well-defined problem. It has a clearly stated goal, and all necessary information to solve the problem is included (connect all of the dots using four straight lines). Furthermore, well-defined problems have a clear ending (you know when you have reached the solution). Although the solution is "outside the box" and not easy to see at first, once it has been found, it seems obvious. Other examples of well-defined problems are the [[Tower of Hanoi]] and the [[Rubik's Cube]].

In contrast, characteristics of ill-defined problems are:
*not clear what the question really is
*not clear how to arrive at a solution
*no idea what the solution looks like
An example of an ill-defined problem is "what is the essence of happiness?" The skills needed to solve this type of problem are the ability to reason and draw inferences, [[metacognition]], and [[epistemic]] monitoring.

===The single straight line solution===
Another well-defined problem for the nine dots starting point is to connect the dots with a single straight line. The solution involves looking outside the two-dimensional sheet of paper on which the nine dots are drawn and coning the paper three-dimensionally aligning the dots along a spiral, thus a single line can be drawn connecting all nine dots - which would appear as three lines in parallel on the paper, when flattened out.&lt;ref&gt;W. Neville Holmes, [http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2000 Fashioning a Foundation for the Computing Profession], July 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

If solving the four line solution is called ''lateral thinking'', then solving the one line solution could well be called ''orthogonal thinking'',&lt;ref&gt;Curtis Ogden, [http://interactioninstitute.org/orthogonal-thinking-and-doing/ Orthogonal Thinking &amp; Doing], 25 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; as it requires two distinct phases: drawing the line and assembling the line.

===The Nine Dots Prize===
The Nine Dots Prize is a competition-based prize for "creative thinking that tackles contemporary societal issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Home |url=https://ninedotsprize.org/ |website=The Nine Dots Prize |publisher=Kadas Prize Foundation |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sponsored by the Kadas Prize Foundation and supported by the [[Cambridge University Press]] and the [[Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH)]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nine Dots Prize |url=http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/programmes/nine-dots-prize |website=CRASSH |publisher=The University of Cambridge |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named in reference to the nine-dot problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nine Dots Prize Identity |url=https://ruddstudio.com/project/the-nine-dots-prize-identity/ |website=Rudd Studio |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metaphor ==
This flexible English phrase is a [[rhetorical]] [[trope (literature)|trope]] with a range of variant applications.

The metaphorical "box" in the phrase "outside the box" may be married with something real and measurable &amp;mdash; for example, perceived budgetary&lt;ref name="lupick"&gt;Lupick, Travis. [https://www.straight.com/article-158377/clone-wars-galactic-task "Clone Wars proved a galactic task for production team."] ''[[The Georgia Straight]]'', August 21, 2008; "...  budgetary constraints forced the production team to &lt;u&gt;think outside the box in a positive way&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; or organizational&lt;ref name="behr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumhollywood.com/2009/08/03/tca-tour-you-asked-for-it-ira-steven-behrs-opening-remarks|title=TCA Tour – You Asked For It: Ira Steven Behr’s opening remarks|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; constraints in a Hollywood development project. Speculating beyond its restrictive confines the box can be both:

* (a) positive&amp;mdash; fostering creative leaps as in generating wild ideas (the conventional use of the term);&lt;ref name="lupick"/&gt; and
* (b) negative&amp;mdash; penetrating through to the "bottom of the box." [[James F. Bandrowski|James Bandrowski]] states that this could result in a frank and insightful re-appraisal of a situation, oneself, the organization, etc.

On the other hand, [[James F. Bandrowski|Bandrowski]] argues that the process of thinking "inside the box" need not be construed in a pejorative sense. It is crucial for accurately parsing and executing a variety of tasks &amp;mdash; making decisions, analyzing data, and managing the progress of standard operating procedures, etc.

Hollywood screenwriter [[Ira Steven Behr]] appropriated this concept to inform plot and character in the context of a television series.  Behr imagined a core character:

{{quote|He is going to be "thinking outside the box," you know, and usually when we use that cliche, we think outside the box means a new thought. So we can situate ourselves back in the box, but in a somewhat better position.&lt;ref name="behr"/&gt;}}

The phrase can be used as a shorthand way to describe speculation about what happens next in a multi-stage [[design thinking]] process.&lt;ref name="behr"/&gt;

'''''Tough Boris''''' is a 1994 Children's picture book by [[Mem Fox]]. It is about a [[pirate]] who grieves when his parrot dies and a boy who helps him through this difficult time.

==Reception==
''[[BookList]]'' wrote "This picture book is full of surprises, both in the simple text and in the dramatic underlying story the pictures tell.", but also stated "the design is confusing; the boy appears on the imprint page but then remains hidden until the middle of the book; some kids may be puzzled about where he comes from."&lt;ref name=buffalo/&gt; The ''[[School Library Journal]]'' called it "A compelling and entertaining tale of adventure."&lt;ref name=buffalo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/801313/Reviews |title=Tough Boris |website=Buffalo and Erie County Public Library |accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[New York Times]]'' review noted "a rather puny story line." and concluded "Resisting the temptation to reveal everything, author and illustrator instead give imaginative children something much better -- a picture book that luxuriates in pure possibility."&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |author=Patricia T.

A 1944 illustration by [[Thomas C. Lea III]] of [[World War II]]: "[[Thousand-yard stare|The 2000 Yard Stare]]".]]

The use of '''war as metaphor''' is a longstanding literary and rhetorical [[Trope (literature)|trope]]. In political usage, [[war]] [[metaphor]]s are used to manage a perceived societal problem, with the concept taking the place of an individual or state enemy in true war.

[[James Childress]] describes the use of war as a metaphor as a dilemma: "In debating social policy through the language of war, we often forget the moral reality of war."&lt;ref name="jfc"/&gt; One fundamental problem is that it is often unclear when the "war" is over.&lt;ref name="sr-20160518"/&gt;

The [[Cultural Revolution]] in China 1966−1976, which initially was launched as a "War against Revisionism", is a discouraging example of a metaphorical war against "-isms".&lt;ref name="sr-20160518"/&gt;

== Examples ==
Examples of war used as a metaphor, often on the form "War on..." or "War against...":

* "[[Customs war]]", also known as a "toll war" or "tariff war", a type of economic conflict between two or more states.
* "[[Trade war]]"
* "[[War on crime|War on Crime]]", 1930s, [[J. Edgar Hoover]]
* "[[Cold War]]" (1947—1991), a period of hostility between the two dominant [[superpower]]s at the time, the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The Cold War in itself was never a war, but several [[proxy war]]s were carried out by both sides over the period.
* The [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966−1976) in China was launched as a "War against Revisionism"&lt;ref name="sr-20160518"/&gt; Marshall [[ Lin Biao]] is given credit for inspiring war metaphors when he said in 1965, at the outset of the movement, "The battlefield of the Cultural Revolution cannot call a ceasefire. This is a war without that option."&lt;ref&gt; {{citation|author=Xing Lu|title=Rhetoric of the Chinese Cultural Revolution: The Impact on Chinese Thought, Culture, and Communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GO5HrrJC_aMC&amp;pg=PA91|date=January 2004|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-57003-543-2|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William C. Rodgers''' (also known as '''Bill Rodgers''' and '''Avalon''') (died December 21, 2005) was an [[environmental activism|environmental activist]], [[animal rights]] activist and a co-proprietor of the [[Catalyst Infoshop]] in [[Prescott, Arizona]], USA. He was one of six environmental activists arrested December 7, 2005 as part of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s [[Operation Backfire (FBI)|Operation Backfire]]. His charge was one count of [[arson]] for a June, 1998 fire set by the [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF) at the National Wildlife Research Center in [[Olympia, Washington]]. He was found dead in his jail cell on December 21, 2005. According to police, Rodgers committed [[suicide]] [[Asphyxia|using a plastic bag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Remembering Bill Rodgers: Long Live Avalon! | publisher=Slingshot | url=http://slingshot.tao.ca/89/bill.php | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622113348/http://slingshot.tao.ca:80/89/bill.php | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2006-06-22 | accessdate = 2006-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
=== Before ELF ===

Rodgers first adopted deep ecology style thinking and engaged in [[Earth First!]] activism at Mt. Graham telescope project protests of the early 1990s in Arizona.  He lived out of his Toyota 4x4 as he traveled North America's wild lands and became involved in many Earth First demonstrations of that time. Rogers was one of the few long-term activists to camp out in snow caves in central Idaho's deepest wilderness during the Cove/Mallard timber sale in the winter of 1994/1995.&lt;ref&gt;Tree Huggers: Victory, Defeat &amp; Renewal in the Northwest Ancient Forest Campaign. author Kathie Durbin. 1996 p269-271,288.&lt;/ref&gt;

His experiences and exposure in some of the last true wild lands of this planet must have further radicalized Avalon beyond the civil disobedience activism of [[Earth First!]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} EF style civil disobedience was at the time was under consideration as possible terrorism by the US Congress in hearings of select subcommittees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Acts_of_ecoterrorism_by_radical_environm.html?id=V_AnAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Acts of eco-terrorism by radical environmental organizations: hearing before the Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, One Hundred Fifth Congress, second session, June 9, 1998|date=1 January 2000|publisher=U.S. G.P.O.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avalon was a long term Earth First! activist, one of the occupation activists of the Cove/Mallard timber sale protests for years and was one of 4 whom constantly camped out in snow-caves monitoring the only logging of Noble Road in the winter of January to March 1995 in 12-foot deep snow and sub-zero temps. After witnessing the destruction of "America's Amazon Jungle", Avalon became disenchanted with mere civil-disobedience tactics and grew more radical. &lt;ref&gt;William C. Rodgers&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.targetofopportunity.com/elf.htm|title=Earth Liberation Front (ELF)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Avalon briefly secluded himself in spring of 1995 only to reappear at the Earth First 11-month-long occupation of the Warner Creek timber sale or 'Free Cascadia' in Oregon.  During these times Avalon always spoke of being a witness for the defenseless and was a peaceful presence.

While participating in the occupation of Warner Creek Oregon, Rogers first met Jacob Ferguson aka "Donut", the man who years later turned FBI informant against this cell of Earth Liberation Front activists, to avoid prison time for heroin possession.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press 05/24/2007 by Jeff Barnard&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Rodgers openly debated with other radical environmentalists against the effectiveness of targeted property destruction operations, during the mid-90's.

===ELF and later===
Between 1996 and 2001 the ELF cell Rogers was involved in is alleged to have started fifteen fires across the West.&lt;ref name=rseco /&gt; 

Rodgers wrote an article for the Earth First Journal about how drug abuse was sapping the will &amp; strength of the environmental movement as activists got depressed and sought solace from the emotional pain by smoking marijuana or drinking heavily.{{CN|date=April 2015}}

After an action involving burning SUVs in March 2001, the Police become suspicious of ELF cell member Ferguson. Rogers, worried of getting caught and tired of infighting, moved to Prescott, Arizona.

In 2004, Rogers co-founded the Catalyst Infoshop with Katie Rose Nelson.&lt;ref name=rseco /&gt;

=== Arrest and Death ===
Rodgers was arrested in an FBI raid on December 7, 2005 at the Catalyst Infoshop. The FBI were working on information provided by Ferguson, an informer from the same ELF cell as Rodgers.&lt;ref name=rseco /&gt;

Rodgers wrote a [[suicide note]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenanarchy.org/index.php?action=viewwritingdetail&amp;writingId=564 Operation Backfire: The Feds Make a Monstrous Move], ''[[Green Anarchy]]'', 24 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which he mailed to a number of his friends:

{{quotation|To my friends and supporters to help them make sense of all these events that have happened so quickly: Certain human cultures have been waging war against the Earth for millennia. I chose to fight on the side of bears, mountain lions, skunks, bats, saguaros, cliff rose and all things wild. I am just the most recent casualty in that war. But tonight I have made a jail break&amp;mdash;I am returning home, to the Earth, to the place of my origins. Bill, 12/21/05 (the winter solstice.)}}

== Government claims ==
The FBI has claimed that Rodgers was a criminal "mastermind" and the anonymous author of ''Setting Fire with Electrical Timers, an Earth Liberation Front Guide'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002752813_ecoindictments21m.html?syndication=rss Prosecutors portray close-knit arson team], ''The Seattle Times'', 21 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which explained in detail how to create an [[incendiary device]] known as a "cat's cradle". Authorities said that once the guide was published they no longer were able to tell with certainty when the ELF cell connected to Rodgers was responsible for an arson.

== Continuing influence ==

Rodgers has had a continuing impact on various anarchist and radical environmentalist movements. A number of acts have been dedicated to his memory. Among these have been the removal of 28 beagle puppies from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the Independent University of Madrid&lt;ref&gt;[http://bombsandshields.blogspot.com/2006/01/madrid-spain-animal-liberation-front.html 28 beagles rescued by ALF], ''Bombs and Shields'', 12 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and the burning of a partially constructed development in [[Guelph]], [[Ontario]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mostlywater.org/node/4004 Anti-Sprawl ELF Action in Memory of William Rodgers], ''Mostly Water'', 10 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 presidential campaign===
In October 2014, Istvan announced that he was "in the very early stages of preparing a campaign to try to run" for U.S. President in 2016. He stated that his goals would be to support scientists in "overcoming human death and aging within 15-20 years" to encourage Americans to embrace "radical technology and science" and to set up safeguards against dangers including potential abuse of such technology.&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zoltan-istvan/should-a-transhumanist-be_b_5949688.html|title=Should a Transhumanist Run for US President?|publisher=The Huffington Post |author=Zoltan Istvan |date=October 8, 2014|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/sci/transhumanist-party-announces-2016-presidential-candidate.html|title=The Transhumanist Party Announces Their 2016 Presidential Candidate|work=Giant Freakin Robot|date=October 8, 2014|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=courageous&gt;{{cite web|url=http://immortallife.info/articles/entry/istvan-for-president|title=Zoltan Istvan plans a courageous transhuman political surge |publisher=ImmortalLife.info |author=Eric Schulke |date=October 9, 2014 |accessdate=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October and November 2014 interviews, Istvan explained that he aimed to unify the transhumanist community which otherwise was splintered, and to establish a single voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litostpublishing.org/2014/11/23/an-interview-with-zoltan-istvan-founder-of-the-transhumanist-party-and-2016-u-s-presidential-candidate-2/|title=An Interview with Zoltan Istvan, Founder of the Transhumanist Party and 2016 U.S. Presidential Candidate|author=Litost Publishing Collective |date=November 23, 2014|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said great changes in society could happen and that Transhumanism could provide ideas, safeguards and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://futurethinkers.org/zoltan-istvan-future-politics-transhumanism/|title=Zoltan Istvan on The Future of Politics and Transhumanism|date=2015-04-13|website=Future Thinkers Podcast|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said the aim for a Transhumanist Party would be to get onto as many state ballots as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/192385-an-interview-with-zoltan-istvan-leader-of-the-transhumanist-party-and-2016-presidential-contender|title=An interview with Zoltan Istvan, leader of the Transhumanist Party and 2016 presidential contender|work=ExtremeTech|date=October 31, 2014|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, Istvan reported progress in organizing a campaign and explained his wish to get major candidates to address issues. He hoped to be included in some debates, at least with third parties. He himself had funded nearly all of his campaign's expenses to date and he noted donations were needed.&lt;ref name =AjaiRaj&gt;{{citation | last = Raj | first = Ajai | title = The Transhumanist Who Would Be President: An interview with Zoltan Istvan | date = March 6, 2015 | url = https://medium.com/re-form/the-transhumanist-who-would-be-president-8950069ca0a4 | website = Medium.com/re-form | publisher = ''re:form'' (ezine) | access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, it was reported that Istvan was likely to vote [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], placing himself "somewhere between Bernie and Hillary in terms of political ideologies",&lt;ref name=salon-february /&gt; but later in 2016 he also wrote articles supporting Libertarian presidential candidate [[Gary Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/57d8c153e4b0a5cd12d742b1?timestamp=1473823467128 |title=Hillary Clinton’s Health Situation Means Libertarian Gary Johnson Must Now be in the Presidential Debates |first1=Zoltan |last1=Istvan |date=September 13, 2016 |publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]'' |access-date=October 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://futurism.com/gary-johnson-wants-driverless-secret-service-cars-and-a-us-led-gene-editing-revolution/|title=Gary Johnson Wants Driverless Secret Service Cars and a US-Led Gene Editing Revolution|date=August 16, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 15, 2016, Istvan stated on his social media accounts that he would be voting for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=634281330078750&amp;set=a.161095190730702.1073741826.100004906654490&amp;type=3|title=Zoltan Istvan - Dear World, Many friends have been asking... - Facebook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 California gubernatorial campaign===
Istvan emphasizes science, technology, longevity, transhumanism and Libertarian values in his California gubernatorial run, along with support for [[basic income]].&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/10/is-monetizing-federal-land-the-way-to-pay-for-basic-income/|title=Is monetizing federal land the way to pay for basic income? – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests basic income could be paid for without raising taxes through a "Federal Land Dividend". Under this program, the government would allocate monthly payments to households by leasing out federal land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lifeboat.com/blog/2017/05/interview-california-gubernatorial-candidate-proposes-state-wide-basic-income|title=Interview: California gubernatorial candidate proposes state-wide basic income|website=lifeboat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://basicincome.org/news/2017/05/interview-california-gubernatorial-candidate-proposes-state-wide-basic-income/|title=Interview: California gubernatorial candidate proposes state-wide basic income - Basic Income News|date=May 15, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his debut editorial for ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine, he argued that reparations for harm caused to marijuana users during the federal government's [[War on Drugs]] may be appropriate.&lt;ref name="reasonpotfelonarticle"/&gt; He suggested reparations could be paid as tax credits or through the sale of federal lands, so as not to put further burden associated with the drug war on taxpayers.&lt;ref name="reasonpotfelonarticle"/&gt;

===Philosophy===
Istvan states that in the 21st Century, as modern man confronts the finitude of life, everyone faces a Transhumanist Wager, a concept which is explored in [[The Transhumanist Wager|his science fiction novel of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wfs.org/worldfuture-2014/worldfuture-conference-sectors/everyone-faces-transhumanist-wager|title=Everyone Faces a Transhumanist Wager|publisher=Wfs.org|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Transhumanist Wager follows from a life philosophy Istvan calls Teleological Egocentric Functionalism (TEF). Istvan summarizes the Transhumanist Wager as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Transhumanist Wager|url=http://www.zoltanistvan.com/TranshumanistWager.html|website=www.zoltanistvan.com|publisher=www.zoltanistvan.com|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
TEF is predicated on logic, a simple wager that every human faces:

If a reasoning human being loves and values life, they will want to live as long as possible—the desire to be immortal. Nevertheless, it's impossible to know if they're going to be immortal once they die. To do nothing doesn't help the odds of attaining immortality—since it seems evident that everyone will die someday and possibly cease to exist. To try to do something scientifically constructive towards ensuring immortality beforehand is the most logical conclusion.|sign=|source=}}

Istvan is the creator of the concepts of Theistcideism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/do-we-have-free-will-because-god-killed-herself|title=Do We Have Free Will Because God Killed Itself?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20151121/NEWS/151129999|title=Marin Snapshot: Mill Valley man runs for president of Transhumanist Party|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Istvan |first=Zoltan |editor-last=Mapson |editor-first=Knujon |title=Pandeism: An Anthology |publisher=John Hunt Publishing |date=January 27, 2017 |pages=274–291 |chapter=Transhumanism and Theistcideism |isbn=978-1785354120}}&lt;/ref&gt; the AI Imperative,&lt;ref name=armsrace&gt;{{cite news|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/a-global-arms-race-to-create-a-superintelligent-ai-is-looming |title=A Global Arms Race to Create a Superintelligent AI is Looming |author=Zoltan Istvan|date=March 6, 2015 |publisher=Motherboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Singularity Disparity,&lt;ref name=whatif&gt;{{cite news|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/what-if-one-country-achieves-the-singularity-first |title=What If One Country Achieves the Singularity First? |author=Zoltan Istvan |date=April 21, 2015 |publisher=Motherboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/interviews/a35078/transhumanist-presidential-candidate-zoltan/|title=Can This Man and His Massive Robot Network Save America?|date=May 19, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speciation Syndrome&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/the-coming-genetic-editing-age-of-humans-wont-be-easy-to-stomach|title=The Coming Genetic Editing Age of Humans Won’t Be Easy to Stomach|date=May 31, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jethro's Window,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-language-of-aliens-will-always-be-indecipherable|title=The Language of Aliens Will Always Be Indecipherable|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a possible solution to the [[Fermi Paradox]].

Istvan authored an article entitled "Transhumanism and Theistcideism" for publication in ''[[Pandeism: An Anthology]]'' (2017).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1785354124/ Amazon.com page for ''Pandeism: An Anthology'']; [https://web.archive.org/web/20161208012044/https://www.amazon.com/Zoltan-Istvan/e/B00ARY87WC Amazon.com page for Zoltan Istvan showing ''Pandeism: An Anthology''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Istvan has a chip implant in his hand and consulted for the U.S. Navy on broad use of the implant in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1292761/us-navy-considers-plans-to-fit-humans-with-microchips-and-track-their-every-move/|title=US Navy 'discussed plans to fit humans with microchips and track their every move'|date=June 16, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techinsider.io/presidential-candidate-zoltan-istvan-gets-an-rfid-chip-implant-2015-9|title=I just got a computer chip implanted in my hand — and the rest of the world won't be far behind|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Chip-enhanced-political-candidates-coming-soon-8694149.php|title=Chip-enhanced political candidates coming soon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3645171/Is-Navy-planning-implant-people-microchips-Officials-consult-Presidential-candidate-merging-humans-machines.html|title=Is the US Navy planning to implant people with microchips?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sputniknews.com/science/20160619/1041597594/transhumanism-microchips-us-navy.html|title='Within Ten Years 50% of Americans Will Be Chipped'|first=|last=|publisher=Sputnik News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Istvan's novel, the three laws of Transhumanism are:

#A transhumanist must safeguard one's own existence above all else.
#A transhumanist must strive to achieve omnipotence as expediently as possible—so long as one's actions do not conflict with the First Law.
#A transhumanist must safeguard value in the universe—so long as one's actions do not conflict with the First and Second Laws.

==Transhumanist community reaction==

Within the transhumanist community, reactions to Istvan's U.S. Transhumanist Party have ranged from the enthusiastic and supportive to sharply critical. Some transhumanist critics, such as Peter Rothman, have questioned whether the Transhumanist Party adds value to the overall goals of transhumanism.&lt;ref name="standfordpol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stanfordpolitics.com/2014/12/the-political-vacuity-of-transhumanism/ |title=The Political Vacuity of Transhumanism |author=Truman Chen |publisher=Stanford Political Journal |date=December 15, 2014 |accessdate=January 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Istvan resides in [[Mill Valley, California]] with his daughters and physician wife.&lt;ref name=vlarson/&gt; He identifies as an atheist.&lt;ref name="atheist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zoltan-istvan/im-an-atheist-therefore-i_b_4388778.html|title=I'm an Atheist, Therefore I'm a Transhumanist|first=Zoltan|last=Istvan|date=December 5, 2013|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, he helped launch BiZoHa, the world's first free-thinker orphanage, in Mukhoya, [[Kasese District|Kasese district]], western [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name=bizoha&gt;{{cite web|date= February 27, 2015 | author=BiZoHa Orphanage |url=http://brighterbrains.org/articles/entry/bizoha-the-worlds-first-atheist-orphanage-launched-by-brighter-brains-insti |title=BiZoHa - the World’s First Atheist Orphanage - launched by Brighter Brains Institute |publisher=Brighter Brains Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Istvan's promotional article on the topic in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'s'' ''Motherboard'', helped a [[GoFundMe]] campaign to achieve success in raising $5,820 to provide funding for the orphanage.&lt;ref name=bizoha/&gt;&lt;ref name=motherboard&gt;{{cite web |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-worlds-first-atheist-orphanage-just-launched-a-crowdfunding-campaign |title=The World's First Atheist Orphanage Has Launched a Crowdfunding Campaign |author=Zoltan Istvan |date=February 24, 2015 |publisher=Motherboard.vice.com |accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
