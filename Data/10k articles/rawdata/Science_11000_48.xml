'''Bayly Glacier''' ({{Coord|64|37|S|61|50|W|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] flowing into the head of [[Bancroft Bay]], on the west coast of [[Graham Land]]. It was mapped by the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey]] (FIDS) from photos taken by [[Hunting Aerosurveys Ltd]] in 1956–57, and named by the [[UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee]] in 1960 for [[Maurice B. Bayly]], FIDS geologist at the [[Danco Island]] station in 1956 who, together with [[L. Harris]], pioneered the route from the [[Portal Point]] hut (on nearby [[Reclus Peninsula]]) to the plateau in February 1957.

'''Berthelot's reagent''' is an [[alkali]]ne solution of [[phenol]] and [[hypochlorite]], used in [[analytical chemistry]].  It is named after its inventor, [[Marcellin Berthelot]]. Ammonia reacts with Berthelot's reagent to form a blue product which is used in a [[colorimetric]] method for determining [[ammonia]]. The reagent can also be used for determining [[urea]].  In this case the [[enzyme]] [[urease]] is used to [[Catalysis|catalyze]] the [[hydrolysis]] of urea into [[carbon dioxide]] and ammonia.  The ammonia is then determined with Berthelot's reagent.

==Variations==
Phenol in the Berthelot reagent can be replaced by a variety of phenolic reagents, the most common being [[sodium salicylate]], which is significantly less toxic.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, G. K., T.R. Ellsworth, and R.L. Mulvaney.  1995. Microscale determination of inorganic nitrogen in water and soil extracts.  Communications in Soil Science and Plant Analysis. 26:303-316.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been used for [[blood urea nitrogen]] (BUN) determinations and commonly is used to determine water and soil total and ammonia-N.  Replacement of phenol by [[2-phenylphenol]] reduces interferences by a variety of soil and water constituents and improves color stability at slightly lower [[pH]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhine, E. D., G.K. Sims, R.L. Mulvaney, and E.J. Pratt.  1998.  Improving the Berthelot reaction for determining ammonium in soil extracts and water.  Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 62:473-480.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Berthelot's reagent has been used in a range of situations. It is often used in colorimetric methods, through an [[AutoAnalyzer]], [[spectrophotometer]], or multiwell plate spectrophotometer.&lt;ref&gt;Rhine, E. D., G.K. Sims, R.L. Mulvaney, and E.J. Pratt.  1998.  Improving the Berthelot reaction for determining ammonium in soil extracts and water.  Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 62:473-480.&lt;/ref&gt; The reagent lacks sensitivity in situations where there may be [[amine]]s as well as ammonia, however this can be overcome in part by the use of 2-pheylphenol to replace phenol. An [[ion selective electrode]], or distillation/titration method can often be used in cases where Berthelot chemistry is ineffective.

Berthelot chemistry has also been adapted for the analysis of [[nitrite]] and [[nitrate]] in soil and water after conversion, typically by reduction with [[Devarda's alloy]], of these species to ammonium.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, G.K.  2006.  Using the Berthelot Method for Nitrite and Nitrate Analysis. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 70 (3): 1038.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2949">A '''climate pattern''' is any recurring characteristic of the climate. Climate patterns can last tens of thousands of years, like the [[glacial period|glacial]] and [[interglacial]] periods within [[ice age]]s, or repeat each year, like [[monsoon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2002/june/060602.html 100,000-year climate pattern linked to sun's magnetic cycles, according to a new analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;

A climate pattern may come in the form of a [[climate cycle|regular cycle]], like the [[diurnal cycle]] or the [[season|seasonal cycle]]; a [[quasi periodic]] event, like [[El Niño]]; or a highly irregular event, such as a [[volcanic winter]]. The regular cycles are generally well understood and may be removed by [[normalization (statistics)|normalization]]. For example, graphs which show trends of temperature change will usually have the effects of seasonal variation removed.

== Modes of variability ==
{{main|Climate oscillation}}
A ''mode of variability'' is a climate pattern with identifiable characteristics, specific regional effects, and often oscillatory behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=   http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap3-3/public-review-draft/sap3-3prd-gloss-acro.pdf |title=   climate science_glossary |deadurl=   yes |archiveurl=   https://web.archive.org/web/20090813160147/http://climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap3-3/public-review-draft/sap3-3prd-gloss-acro.pdf |archivedate=   2009-08-13 |df=    }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modes of variability are used by climatologists as [[Climatology#Indices|indices]] to represent the general climatic state of a region affected by a given climate pattern.

Measured via an [[empirical orthogonal function]] analysis, the mode of variability with the greatest effect on climates worldwide is the [[seasonal cycle]], followed by [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]], followed by [[thermohaline circulation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/climtrend/index.html Climate Trends Associated with Multi-decadal Variability of Atlantic Hurricane Activity]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other well-known modes of variability include:
* The [[Antarctic oscillation]]
* The [[Arctic oscillation]]
* The [[Atlantic multidecadal oscillation]]
* The [[Indian Ocean Dipole]]
* The [[Madden–Julian oscillation]]
* The [[North Atlantic oscillation]]
* The [[Pacific decadal oscillation]]
* The [[Pacific-North American teleconnection pattern]]
* The [[Quasi-biennial oscillation]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4134">The '''Combined Federated Battle Laboratories Network''' (CFBLNet) is a laboratory environment which utilizes a distributed [[Wide area network|Wide Area Network]] (WAN) as the vehicle to simulate training environments and to de-risk [[command and control]] (C2) and [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] capabilities by conducting [[Research and development|Research and Development]], Training, Trials and Assessment (RDTT&amp;A) on command, control, communication, computer, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) initiatives and training events. Since 2001, membership has been established and represented by three core parties: the U.S. Joint Staff, the Combined Communications and Electronics Board (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States), and the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (including NATO agencies and 29 member nations, not all of which actively participate). Besides the core parties to the CFBLNet Technical Arrangement, four nations (Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland) have become Guest Mission Partners under rules contained in CFBLNet governance documentation referred to as Publication 1.

CFBLNet provides the main platform for conducting Coalition Interoperability Assurance and Validation (CIAV) events in the context of [[Federated Mission Networking]].

== Network Structure ==
The CFBLNet consists of a distributed and integrated [[network architecture]] of combined, joint, and military service infrastructure components (networks, database servers, application servers, client workstations, etc.). These strings of network equipment and services are located within the confines of the various national and international battle laboratories and experimentation sites of the participants, which provide the applications, analytic tools, and communications necessary to conduct initiatives or experiments.

No single nation owns the CFBLNet infrastructure; each member nation is responsible for the funding and maintenance of its own systems and CFBL network segments, which hook into the backbone at a defined Point-of-Presence (POP). All CFBLNet members must respect the [[sovereignty]] and [[intellectual property]] of the other nations. Also, each country is responsible for funding its own experiments. The Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) &lt;ref&gt;DISA.mil: [http://www.disa.mil/mnis/ Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS)]&lt;/ref&gt; in Fort Meade, Maryland (USA) maintains day-to-day control of the network and coordinates activities on the network. 

The U.S. CFBLNet infrastructure is extensive and reaches to international demarcation points for the Southern Hemisphere and Europe. Nations and organizations within nations which are not a part of the Technical Agreement must be sponsored to become a Guest CFBLNet Mission Partner (GMP) by a charter member, Core CFBLNet Mission Partner (CMP), to sponsor initiatives and to connect to the CFBLNet.

== History ==
The CFBLNet grew out the network designed to support the U.S. Joint Warfighter Interoperability Demonstrations (JWID), which used to build a support network for the period of the demonstrations and tear it down each year after the demonstrations. In 1999, the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration/Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (CWID/JWID) exercise used, for the first time, a permanent infrastructure that became what is now called the Combined Federated Battle Laboratories Network (CFBLNet), as established by the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Board (NC3B) in 2001. The formal Technical Agreement (or charter) was signed in August 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/5742329/UNCLASSIFIED-COMBINED-FEDERATED-BATTLE-LABORATORY-NETWORK-CFBLNET-ANNUAL-REPORT CFBLNet 2006 Annual Report], page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bokeh Example.jpg|thumb|A photograph of [[Christmas lights]] with significant defocus aberration.]]
{{Optical aberration}}
In [[optics]], '''defocus''' is the [[aberration in optical systems|aberration]] in which an image is simply out of [[focus (optics)|focus]]. This aberration is familiar to anyone who has used a camera, videocamera, microscope, telescope, or binoculars.  Optically, defocus refers to a [[Translation (physics)|translation]] of the focus along the [[optical axis]] away from the detection surface.  In general, defocus reduces the [[acutance#Sharpness|sharpness]] and [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] of the [[image]].  What should be sharp, high-contrast edges in a scene become gradual transitions.  Fine detail in the scene is blurred or even becomes invisible.  Nearly all image-forming optical devices incorporate some form of focus adjustment to minimize defocus and maximize image quality.

== In optics and photography ==
The degree of image blurring for a given amount of focus shift depends inversely on the lens [[f-number]].  Low f-numbers, such as {{f/|1.4|}} to {{f/}}2.8, are very sensitive to defocus and have very shallow [[depth of focus|depths of focus]]. High f-numbers, in the {{f/}}16 to {{f/}}32 range, are highly tolerant of defocus, and consequently have large depths of focus.  The limiting case in f-number is the [[pinhole camera]], operating at perhaps {{f/}}100 to {{f/}}1000, in which case all objects are in focus almost regardless of their distance from the pinhole [[aperture]].  The penalty for achieving this extreme depth of focus is very dim illumination at the imaging [[Photographic film|film]] or [[Image sensor|sensor]], limited resolution due to [[diffraction]], and very long [[exposure time]], which introduces the potential for image degradation due to [[motion blur]].

The amount of allowable defocus is related to the [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of the imaging medium. A lower-resolution imaging chip or film is more tolerant of defocus and other aberrations. To take full advantage of a higher resolution medium, defocus and other aberrations must be minimized.

Defocus is modeled in [[Zernike polynomial]] format as &lt;math&gt;a(2 \rho^2-1)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the defocus coefficient in [[wavelength]]s of light.  This corresponds to the [[parabola]]-shaped [[optical path difference]] between two spherical [[wavefront]]s that are [[tangent]] at their [[surface vertex|vertices]] and have different [[radius of curvature (optics)|radii of curvature]].

For some applications, such as [[phase contrast]] [[electron microscopy]], defocused images can contain useful information. Multiple images recorded with various values of defocus can be used to examine how the intensity of the electron wave varies in three-dimensional space, and from this information the phase of the wave can be inferred. This is the basis of non-interferometric [[phase retrieval]]. Examples of phase retrieval algorithms that use defocused images include the [[Gerchberg–Saxton algorithm]] and various methods based on the [[transport of intensity equation]].

== In vision ==
In casual conversation, the term ''blur'' can be used to describe any reduction in vision. However, in a clinical setting blurry vision means the subjective experience or perception of [[defocus aberration|optical defocus]] within the [[Human eye|eye]], called [[refractive error]]. Blur may appear differently depending on the amount and type of refractive error. The following are some examples of blurred images that may result from refractive errors:&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;The extent of blurry vision can be assessed by measuring [[visual acuity]] with an [[eye chart]]. Blurry vision is often corrected by focusing light on the retina with [[Corrective lens|corrective lenses]].  These corrections sometimes have unwanted effects including magnification or reduction, distortion, color fringes, and altered depth perception. During an eye exam, the patient's acuity is measured without correction, with their current correction, and after [[Eye examination#Refraction|refraction]].  This allows the [[optometrist]] or [[ophthalmologist]] ("eye doctor") to determine the extent refractive errors play in limiting the quality of the patient's vision.  A [[Snellen chart|Snellen acuity]] of 6/6 or 20/20, or as decimal value 1.0, is considered to be sharp vision for an average human (young adults may have nearly twice that value).  Best-corrected acuity lower than that is an indication that there is another limitation to vision beyond the correction of refractive error.

=== The blur disk ===

Optical defocus can result from incorrect corrective lenses or insufficient [[accommodation (eye)| accommodation]], as, e.g., in [[presbyopia]] from the aging eye. As said above, light rays from a point source are then not focused to a single point on the retina but are distributed in a little disk of light, called the ''blur disk''. Its size depends on pupil size and amount of defocus, and is calculated by the equation 

&lt;math&gt;d=0.057 p D&lt;/math&gt;

(''d'' = diameter in degrees visual angle, ''p'' = pupil size in mm, ''D'' = defocus in diopters).&lt;ref name="blur_unblurred"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strasburger | first1 = Hans | last2 = Bach | first2 = Michael | last3 = Heinrich | first3 = Sven P. | title = Blur Unblurred—A Mini Tutorial| journal = i-Perception| volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 1-15 | year = 2018 | url =  http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2041669518765850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Linear time-invariant system|linear systems theory]], the point image (i.e. the blur disk) is referred to as the [[point spread function]] (PSF). The retinal image is given by the [[convolution]] of the in-focus image with the PSF.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="511">In [[pragmatics]], a '''degreeting''' refers to the conversational procedure by which two participants of a conversation agree to discontinue the conversation. It is so named because a degreeting concludes a conversation in a similar way that a greeting engages one.

The following conversation is an example of degreeting:
:Andrew: "''I'll see you later then.''"
:Bethany: "''Yeah ok, see ya!''"
:Andrew: "''Bye.''"

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure1.jpg|thumb|280px|Figure 1. A [[riparian forest]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], [[New Hampshire]] (USA).]]

'''Ecosystem ecology''' is the integrated study of living ([[Biotic component|biotic]]) and non-living ([[Abiotic component|abiotic]]) components of [[ecosystem]]s and their interactions within an ecosystem framework. This [[science]] examines how ecosystems work and relates this to their components such as [[chemical]]s, [[bedrock]], [[soil]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s.

Ecosystem ecology examines physical and biological structures and examines how these ecosystem characteristics interact with each other. Ultimately, this helps us understand how to maintain high quality water and economically viable commodity production. A major focus of ecosystem ecology is on functional processes, ecological mechanisms that maintain the structure and services produced by ecosystems. These include [[primary productivity]] (production of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]]), [[decomposition]], and [[trophic level|trophic]] interactions.

Studies of ecosystem function have greatly improved human understanding of sustainable production of [[Fodder|forage]], [[fiber]], [[fuel]], and provision of [[water]]. Functional processes are mediated by regional-to-local level [[climate]], [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]], and management. Thus ecosystem ecology provides a powerful framework for identifying ecological mechanisms that interact with global environmental problems, especially [[global warming]] and degradation of surface water.

This example demonstrates several important aspects of ecosystems:
# Ecosystem boundaries are often nebulous and may fluctuate in time
# Organisms within ecosystems are dependent on ecosystem level biological and physical processes
# Adjacent ecosystems closely interact and often are interdependent for maintenance of community structure and functional processes that maintain productivity and [[biodiversity]]

These characteristics also introduce practical problems into natural resource management. Who will manage which ecosystem? Will timber cutting in the forest degrade recreational fishing in the stream? These questions are difficult for land managers to address while the boundary between ecosystems remains unclear; even though decisions in one ecosystem will affect the other. We need better understanding of the interactions and interdependencies of these ecosystems and the processes that maintain them before we can begin to address these questions.

Ecosystem ecology is an inherently interdisciplinary field of study. An individual ecosystem is composed of [[populations]] of [[organisms]], interacting within communities, and contributing to the cycling of [[nutrients]] and the flow of [[energy]]. The ecosystem is the principal unit of study in ecosystem ecology.

Population, community, and physiological ecology provide many of the underlying biological mechanisms influencing ecosystems and the processes they maintain. Flowing of energy and cycling of matter at the ecosystem level are often examined in ecosystem ecology, but, as a whole, this science is defined more by subject matter than by scale. Ecosystem ecology approaches organisms and abiotic pools of energy and nutrients as an integrated system which distinguishes it from associated sciences such as [[biogeochemistry]].&lt;ref name= "CH 03"&gt;Chapman, S.K., Hart, S.C., Cobb, N.S., Whitham, T.G., and Koch, G.W.  (2003).  "Insect herbivory increases litter quality and decomposition: an extension of the acceleration hypothesis". in: ''Ecology'' 84:2867-2876.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogeochemistry and [[hydrology]] focus on several fundamental ecosystem processes such as biologically mediated chemical cycling of nutrients and physical-biological cycling of water. Ecosystem ecology forms the mechanistic basis for regional or global processes encompassed by landscape-to-regional hydrology, global biogeochemistry, and earth system science.&lt;ref name= "CH 03"/&gt;

== History ==
Ecosystem ecology is philosophically and historically rooted in terrestrial ecology. The ecosystem concept has evolved rapidly during the last 100 years with important ideas developed by [[Frederic Clements]], a botanist who argued for specific definitions of ecosystems and that physiological processes were responsible for their development and persistence.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, J.B. (1992). ''An Entangled Bank: The origins of ecosystem ecology''. Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of Clements ecosystem definitions have been greatly revised, initially by [[Henry Gleason]] and [[Arthur Tansley]], and later by contemporary ecologists, the idea that physiological processes are fundamental to ecosystem structure and function remains central to ecology.

[[Image:Silver Spring Model.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 3. Energy and matter flows through an ecosystem, adapted from the Silver Springs model.&lt;ref&gt;Odum, H.T. (1971). ''Environment, Power, and Society''. Wiley-Interscience New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; H are herbivores, C are carnivores, TC are top carnivores, and D are decomposers. Squares represent biotic pools and ovals are fluxes or energy or nutrients from the system.]] Later work by [[Eugene Odum]] and [[Howard T. Odum]] quantified flows of energy and matter at the ecosystem level, thus documenting the general ideas proposed by Clements and his contemporary [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]]. See Figure 3.

In this model, energy flows through the whole system were dependent on biotic and abiotic interactions of each individual component ([[species]], inorganic pools of nutrients, etc.). Later work demonstrated that these interactions and flows applied to nutrient cycles, changed over the course of [[ecological succession|succession]], and held powerful controls over ecosystem productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Odum, E.P 1969. "The strategy of ecosystem development". in: ''Science'' 164:262-270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="L70"&gt;Likens, G. E., F. H. Bormann, N. M. Johnson, D. W. Fisher and R. S. Pierce. (1970). "Effects of forest cutting and herbicide treatment on nutrient budgets in the Hubbard Brook watershed-ecosystem". in: ''Ecological Monographs'' 40:23-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Transfers of energy and nutrients are innate to ecological systems regardless of whether they are aquatic or terrestrial. Thus, ecosystem ecology has emerged from important biological studies of plants, animals, [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]], [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]], and [[marine (ocean)|marine]] ecosystems.

==Ecosystem services==
Ecosystem services are ecologically mediated functional processes essential to sustaining healthy [[human]] societies.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, F.S. III, B.H., Walker, R.J., Hobbs, D.U., Hooper, J.H., Lawton, O.E., Sala, and D., Tilman. (1997). "Biotic control over the functioning of ecosystems". in: ''Science'' 277:500-504.&lt;/ref&gt; Water provision and filtration, production of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], and [[fisheries]], and removal of [[greenhouse gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the [[atmosphere]] are examples of ecosystem services essential to [[public health]] and economic opportunity. Nutrient cycling is a process fundamental to agricultural and forest production.

However, like most ecosystem processes, nutrient cycling is not an ecosystem characteristic which can be “dialed” to the most desirable level. Maximizing production in degraded systems is an overly simplistic solution to the complex problems of hunger and economic security. For instance, intensive [[fertilizer]] use in the midwestern United States has resulted in degraded fisheries in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Defries, R.S., J.A. Foley, and G.P. Asner. (2004). "Land-use choices: balancing human needs and ecosystem function". in: ''Frontiers in ecology and environmental science''. 2:249-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Regrettably, a “[[Green Revolution]]” of intensive chemical fertilization has been recommended for agriculture in [[developed countries|developed]] and [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Chrispeels, M.J. and Sadava, D. (1977). ''Plants, food, and people''. W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quinones, M.A., N.E. Borlaug, C.R. Dowswell. (1997). "A fertilizer-based green revolution for Africa". In: ''Replenishing soil fertility in Africa''. Soil Science Society of America special publication number 51. Soil Science Society of America, Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies risk alteration of ecosystem processes that may be difficult to restore, especially when applied at broad scales without adequate assessment of impacts. Ecosystem processes may take many years to recover from significant disturbance.&lt;ref name ="L70"/&gt;

For instance, large-scale forest clearance in the northeastern United States during the 18th and 19th centuries has altered soil texture, dominant vegetation, and nutrient cycling in ways that impact forest productivity in the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, D. R. (1992). "Land-use history (1730-1990) and vegetation dynamics in central New England, USA". In: ''Journal of Ecology'' 80: 753-772.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Motzkin, G., D. R. Foster, A. Allen, J. Harrod, and R. D. Boone. (1996). "Controlling site to evaluate history: vegetation patterns of a New England sand plain". In: ''Ecological Monographs'' 66: 345-365.&lt;/ref&gt; An appreciation of the importance of ecosystem function in maintenance of productivity, whether in agriculture or forestry, is needed in conjunction with plans for restoration of essential processes. Improved knowledge of ecosystem function will help to achieve long-term sustainability and stability in the poorest parts of the world.

==Operation==
Biomass productivity is one of the most apparent and economically important ecosystem functions. Biomass accumulation begins at the cellular level via photosynthesis. Photosynthesis requires water and consequently global patterns of annual biomass production are correlated with annual precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;Huxman TE, ea.(2004). "Convergence across biomes to a common rain-use efficiency". ''Nature''. 429: 651-654&lt;/ref&gt; Amounts of productivity are also dependent on the overall capacity of plants to capture sunlight which is directly correlated with plant leaf area and N content.

[[Primary production|Net primary productivity]] (NPP) is the primary measure of biomass accumulation within an ecosystem. Net primary productivity can be calculated by a simple formula where the total amount of productivity is adjusted for total productivity losses through maintenance of biological processes:

:NPP = GPP – R&lt;sub&gt;producer&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure4.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 4. Seasonal and annual changes in ambient carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) concentration at Mauna Loa Hawaii (Atmosphere) and above the canopy of a deciduous forest in Massachusetts (Forest). Data show clear seasonal trends associated with periods of high and low NPP and an overall annual increase of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Data approximates of those reported by Keeling and Whorf&lt;ref&gt;Keeling, C.D. and T.P. Whorf. (2005). "Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; records from sites in the SIO air sampling network". In: ''Trends: A Compendium of Data on Global Change''. Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge, Tenn., U.S.A.&lt;/ref&gt; and Barford.&lt;ref name = "B01"/&gt;]] Where GPP is gross primary productivity and R&lt;sub&gt;producer&lt;/sub&gt; is photosynthate ([[Carbon]]) lost via [[cellular respiration]].

NPP is difficult to measure but a new technique known as eddy co-variance has shed light on how natural ecosystems influence the atmosphere. Figure 4 shows seasonal and annual changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration measured at [[Mauna Loa]], [[Hawaii]] from 1987 to 1990. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration steadily increased, but within-year variation has been greater than the annual increase since measurements began in 1957.

These variations were thought to be due to seasonal uptake of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during summer months.  A newly developed technique for assessing ecosystem NPP has confirmed seasonal variation are driven by seasonal changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake by vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Goulden, M. L., J. W. Munger, S.-M. Fan, B. C. Daube, and S. C. Wofsy, (1996). "Effects of interannual climate variability on the carbon dioxide exchange of a temperate deciduous forest". In: ''Science'' 271:1576-1578&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "B01"&gt;Barford, C. C., ea. (2001). "Factors controlling long and short term sequestration of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a mid-latitude forest". In: ''Science'' 294: 1688-1691&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led many scientists and policy makers to speculate that ecosystems can be managed to ameliorate problems with [[global warming]]. This type of management may include reforesting or altering forest harvest schedules for many parts of the world.

===Decomposition and nutrient cycling===
[[Decomposition]] and nutrient cycling are fundamental to ecosystem biomass production. Most natural ecosystems are [[nitrogen]] (N) limited and biomass production is closely correlated with N turnover.&lt;ref&gt;Vitousek, P.M. and Howarth, R.W. (1991). "Nitrogen limitation on land and in the sea: how can it occur?" In: ''Biogeochemistry'' 13:87-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reich, P.B., Grigal, D.F., Aber, J.D., Gower, S.T. (1997). "Nitrogen mineralization and productivity in 50 hardwood and conifer stands on diverse soils". In: ''Ecology'' 78:335-347.&lt;/ref&gt;
Typically external input of nutrients is very low and efficient recycling of nutrients maintains productivity.&lt;ref name ="L70"/&gt; Decomposition of plant litter accounts for the majority of nutrients recycled through ecosystems (Figure 3). Rates of plant litter decomposition are highly dependent on litter quality; high concentration of phenolic compounds, especially [[lignin]], in plant litter has a retarding effect on litter decomposition.&lt;ref name= "M 82"&gt;Melillo, J.M., Aber, J.D., and Muratore, J.F. (1982).  "Nitrogen and lignin control of hardwood leaf litter decomposition dynamics". In: ''Ecology'' 63:621-626.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hättenschwiler S. and P.M. Vitousek (2000). "The role of polyphenols in terrestrial ecosystem nutrient cycling". In: ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 15: 238-243&lt;/ref&gt; More complex C compounds are decomposed more slowly and may take many years to completely breakdown. Decomposition is typically described with [[exponential decay]] and has been related to the mineral concentrations, especially manganese, in the leaf litter.&lt;ref&gt;Davey MP, B Berg, P Rowland, BA Emmett. 2007. Decomposition of oak leaf litter is related to initial litter Mn concentrations. Canadian Journal of Botany. 85(1). 16-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berg B, Davey MP, Emmett B, Faituri M, Hobbie S, Johansson MB, Liu C, De Marco A, McClaugherty C, Norell L, Rutigliano F, De Santo AV. 2010. Factors influencing limit values for pine needle litter decomposition - a synthesis for boreal and temperate pine forest systems. Biogeochemistry. 100: 57-73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure5.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 5. Dynamics of decomposing plant litter (A) described with an exponential model (B) and a combined exponential-linear model (C).]]  
Globally, rates of decomposition are mediated by litter quality and climate.&lt;ref&gt;Meentemeyer, V.  1978  "Macroclimate and lignin control of litter decomposition rates". in: ''Ecology'' 59:465-472.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystems dominated by plants with low-lignin concentration often have rapid rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling (Chapin et al. 1982). Simple carbon (C) containing compounds are preferentially metabolized by [[decomposer]] microorganisms which results in rapid initial rates of decomposition, see Figure 5A,&lt;ref&gt;Aber, J.D., and J.M., Melillo  (1982). "Nitrogen immobilization in decaying hardwood leaf litter as a function of initial nitrogen and lignin content". In: ''Canadian Journal of Botany'' 60:2263-2269.&lt;/ref&gt; models that depend on constant rates of decay; so called “k” values, see Figure 5B.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, J.S. (1963). "Energy storage and the balance of producers and decomposers in ecological systems". In: ''Ecology'' 44:322-331.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to litter quality and climate, the activity of soil fauna is very important &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Castro-Huerta, R. |author2=Falco, L. |author3=Sandler, R. |author4=Coviella, C. |year=2015 |title=Differential contribution of soil biota groups to plant litter decomposition as mediated by soil use |journal=[[PeerJ]] |volume=3 |pages=e826 |doi=10.7717/peerj.826 |url=https://peerj.com/articles/826/?td=wk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these models do not reflect simultaneous linear and non-linear decay processes which likely occur during decomposition. For instance, [[proteins]], [[sugars]] and [[lipids]] decompose exponentially, but lignin decays at a more linear rate&lt;ref name= "M 82"/&gt; Thus, litter decay is inaccurately predicted by simplistic models.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, S.A. (1981). "Decay of heterogeneous detritus: a general model". In: ''Journal of theoretical biology''  89:539-547.&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple alternative model presented in Figure 5C shows significantly more rapid decomposition that the standard model of figure 4B. Better understanding of decomposition models is an important research area of ecosystem ecology because this process is closely tied to nutrient supply and the overall capacity of ecosystems to sequester CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere.

===Trophic dynamics===
Trophic dynamics refers to process of energy and [[nutrient]] transfer between organisms. Trophic dynamics is an important part of the structure and function of ecosystems. Figure 3 shows energy transferred for an ecosystem at Silver Springs, Florida. Energy gained by primary producers (plants, P) is consumed by herbivores (H), which are consumed by carnivores (C), which are themselves consumed by “top- carnivores”(TC).

One of the most obvious patterns in Figure 3 is that as one moves up to higher [[trophic level]]s (i.e. from plants to top-carnivores) the total amount of energy decreases. Plants exert a “bottom-up” control on the energy structure of ecosystems by determining the total amount of energy that enters the system.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin F.S. III, Matson, P.A., and Mooney, H.A. (2003). ''Principles of terrestrial ecosystem ecology''. Springer-Verlag, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, predators can also influence the structure of lower trophic levels from the top-down. These influences can dramatically shift dominant species in terrestrial and marine systems&lt;ref&gt;Belovsky, G.E. and J.B. Slade. (2000). "Insect herbivory accelerates nutrient cycling and increases plant production". In: ''Proceedings of the national academy of sciences'' (USA). 97:14412-14417.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frank et al. 2005"&gt;Frank et al. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The interplay and relative strength of top-down vs. bottom-up controls on ecosystem structure and function is an important area of research in the greater field of ecology.

Trophic dynamics can strongly influence rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling in time and in space. For example, herbivory can increase litter decomposition and nutrient cycling via direct changes in litter quality and altered dominant vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, M.D. (2001). "Insect population dynamics meets ecosystem ecology: effects of herbivory on soil nutrient dynamics". In: ''Agricultural and Forest Entomology'' 3:77-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Insect herbivory has been shown to increase rates of decomposition and nutrient turnover due to changes in litter quality and increased [[frass]] inputs.&lt;ref name= "CH 03"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swank, W.T., Waide, J.B., Crossley, D.A., and Todd R.L. (1981). "Insect defoliation enhances nitrate export from forest ecosystems". In: ''Oecologia'' 51:297-299.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
However, insect outbreak does not always increase nutrient cycling. Stadler&lt;ref&gt;Stadler, B., Solinger, St., and Michalzik, B. (2001). "Insect herbivores and the nutrient flow from the canopy to the soil in coniferous and deciduous forests". In: ''[[Oecologia]]'' 126:104-113&lt;/ref&gt; showed that C rich honeydew produced during aphid outbreak can result in increased N immobilization by soil microbes thus slowing down nutrient cycling and potentially limiting biomass production. North atlantic marine ecosystems have been greatly altered by overfishing of cod. Cod stocks crashed in the 1990s which resulted in increases in their prey such as shrimp and snow crab&lt;ref name="Frank et al. 2005"/&gt; Human intervention in ecosystems has resulted in dramatic changes to ecosystem structure and function. These changes are occurring rapidly and have unknown consequences for economic security and human well-being.

==Applications and importance==

===Lessons from two Central American cities===
The biosphere has been greatly altered by the demands of human societies. Ecosystem ecology plays an important role in understanding and adapting to the most pressing current environmental problems. Restoration ecology and ecosystem management are closely associated with ecosystem ecology. Restoring highly degraded resources depends on integration of functional mechanisms of ecosystems.&lt;ref name= "E&amp;T97"&gt;Ehrenfeld, J.G. and Toth, L.A. (1997). "Restoration ecology and the ecosystem perspective". in: ''Restoration Ecology''  5:307-317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without these functions intact, economic value of ecosystems is greatly reduced and potentially dangerous conditions may develop in the field. For example, areas within the mountainous western highlands of [[Guatemala]] are more susceptible to catastrophic landslides and crippling seasonal water shortages due to loss of forest resources. In contrast, cities such as [[Totonicapán]] that have preserved forests through strong social institutions have greater local economic stability and overall greater human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Conz, B.W. 2004. Continuity and Contestation: Conservation Landscapes in Totonicapán, Guatemala. University of Massachusetts Masters of Science thesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation is striking considering that these areas are close to each other, the majority of inhabitants are of [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] descent, and the topography and overall resources are similar. This is a case of two groups of people managing resources in fundamentally different ways. Ecosystem ecology provides the basic science needed to avoid degradation and to restore ecosystem processes that provide for basic human needs.

'''Elkanah Billings''' (May 5, 1820 – June 14, 1876) is often referred to as [[Canada]]'s first [[paleontologist]]. Billings was born on a farm by the [[Rideau River]] outside Bytown ([[Ottawa]]), now known as [[Billings Estate Museum|Billings Estate]]. His parents were named Lamira and [[Braddish Billings]]. His family included an older sister named Sabra and an older brother Maj Braddish Billings Jr, who practised as an architect and served in the [[North-West Rebellion]]. His brother W. Ross Billings also practised as an architect. His younger siblings were Samuel, Sarah and Charles.&lt;ref name=Ot&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawa.ca/residents/heritage/museums/billings/virtual_exhibit/biographies/second/elkanah_en.html |title=Elkanah Billings, 1820-1876 |author=City of Ottawa |work=Billings Estate National Historic Site |accessdate=19 April 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was originally educated in law and in 1845, he was called to the Canadian bar.  In 1852, he founded the journal the ''Canadian Naturalist (and Geologist)''. He continued to practise law until 1856, when he was hired to be the first paleontologist for [[Geological Survey of Canada]] (GSC). In his lifetime, he identified 1065 new [[species]] and 61 new [[genus|genera]], including ''[[Aspidella]]'', the first documented fossil of the [[Ediacaran biota]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Emily Graslie''' is an American [[Science communication|science communicator]] and [[YouTube]] educator. She started volunteering at the [[Philip L. Wright Zoological Museum]] at the [[University of Montana]] in 2011. After appearing in a [[VlogBrothers]] video by [[Hank Green]] in 2012, she was asked to join the [[Nerdfighteria|Nerdfighter]] network. She currently stars in her own educational YouTube channel called "The Brain Scoop." Graslie is now employed by the [[Field Museum]] as their first-ever Chief Curiosity Correspondent.

==Biography==
Graslie earned her bachelor's degree in [[Studio Art]] from the [[University of Montana]] in 2011. As a part of that program, she interned at the Philip L. Wright Zoological Museum in her senior year.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"&gt;{{cite web |last=Waters|first=Hannah |title=A Hilarious Behind-the-Scenes Tour of Montana’s Natural History Museum |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/culturing-science/2013/01/15/brain-scoop-ep-1/|work=[[Scientific American]] |accessdate=12 February 2013 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graslie became a full-time curatorial volunteer after she graduated, while working on her master's degree in [[museum studies]]. She cleaned new specimens, gave tours, trained new interns, and acted as a [[teaching assistant]] for a class at the University of Montana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Philip L.

In June 2013, Graslie was hired by Chicago's [[Field Museum of Natural History]] to become their 'Chief Curiosity Correspondent'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/career/news/a29534/get-that-life-emily-graslie-science/|title=How I Became a Museum's Curiosity Correspondent|date=2014-07-28|work=Cosmopolitan|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continues to host "The Brain Scoop" from this new location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Field Museum Hires Popular YouTube Personality|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/press/field-museum-hires-popular-youtube-personality|website=The Field Museum|accessdate=17 October 2014|date=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the keynote speaker at the Chicago [[March for Science]] on April 22, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=March for Science Chicago Announces Keynote Speaker: Emily Graslie|url=https://medium.com/@sciencemarchchi/march-for-science-chicago-announces-keynote-speaker-emily-graslie-522a2dfb85d9|website=March for Science Chicago|publisher=Medium|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emily Graslie Speaks at March for Science Chicago|url=https://medium.com/@sciencemarchchi/emily-graslie-speaks-at-march-for-science-chicago-d9bc93f182f4|website=March for Science Chicago|publisher=Medium|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graslie first appeared on YouTube in [[Hank Green]]'s December 7, 2012 [[VlogBrothers]] video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Green |first=Hank | authorlink=Hank Green |title=Thoughts from Dead Animals |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxauNFLyu08|publisher=[[VlogBrothers]] |accessdate=13 February 2013 |year=2012a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the video, she showed Green a wide variety of the specimens in the lab. Because of her ease in front of the camera, enthusiasm, and fan comments, Graslie was asked to create her own YouTube channel, "The Brain Scoop", as a part of the [[VlogBrothers|Nerdfighter]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Hank |authorlink=Hank Green |title=Meet the Team: The Missoula Office (And P4A and TheBrainScoop) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhVxNo-HA8g |publisher=VlogBrothers|accessdate=14 February 2013|year=2012b}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series debuted in January 2013. Her work on the series has been described by journalists&lt;!--plural?--&gt; as "articulate and hilarious" as well as enthusiastic.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Polo |first=Susana |year=2013 |title=New Webseries Alert: The Brain Scoop |url=http://www.themarysue.com/museum-animals-youtube/|work=|publisher=The Mary Sue |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her November 27, 2013 video, which addressed the situation of [[women in STEM fields]] and inappropriate comments received to her own postings, received a high level of media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Krulwich |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Krulwich |year=2013a |title=Science Reporter Emily Graslie Reads Her Mail — And It's Not So Nice |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2013/11/30/247842138/science-reporter-emily-graslie-reads-her-mail-and-it-s-not-so-nice |work=Krulwich Wonders |publisher=NPR |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Esposito |first=Stefano |title=Field Museum science show host airs her frustration about sexist comments |url=http://www.suntimes.com/24169911-761/field-museum-science-show-host-airs-her-frustration-about-sexist-comments.html#.VOvoDq05C00 |accessdate=8 December 2013 |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=December 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006200415/http://www.suntimes.com/24169911-761/field-museum-science-show-host-airs-her-frustration-about-sexist-comments.html#.VOvoDq05C00 |archivedate=October 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2014, [[Amy Wallace (journalist)|Amy Wallace]], another science journalist, wrote an article about how science journalists can find themselves the target of ugly personal attacks, and the attacks on female journalists include criticisms of their sexual attractiveness, and their sexual morality.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2014-01-20&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Wallace included Graslie when she listed half a dozen fellow female science journalists whose reasonable, science-based articles on controversial topics had triggered crude abusive backlashes.

In 2014, her channel "The Brain Scoop" was listed on [[New Media Rockstars]] Top 100 Channels, ranked at #96.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The NMR Top 100 YouTube Channels: 100 – 76!|url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/12/the-nmr-top-100-youtube-channels-100-76/|website=New Media Rockstars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, she documented the efforts to help the recovery of the [[Kankakee mallow]], an endangered species that is endemic to Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graslie|first1=Emily|title=This flower only grows in the wild on a single tiny island... in Illinois.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hItzksDHfxQ|website=The Brain Scoop|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the only floral species that is only found in that state, she has started an effort to make it the official Illinois [[List of U.S. state flowers|state flower]], proposing that it replace the more generic Violet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graslie|first1=Emily|title=Campaigning for CHANGE!

==Species named in Graslie's honor==

In recognition of her science education efforts, a  butterfly species, ''[[Wahydra graslieae]]'', was named in her honor.&lt;ref name="Bfly"&gt;{{cite web|last1=van Hoose|first1=Natalie|title=New butterfly species named for Field Museum's Emily Graslie|url=https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/science/new-butterfly-species-named-for-emily-graslie/|dead-url=no|website=Florida Museum|publisher=Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida|accessdate=10 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309054853/https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/science/new-butterfly-species-named-for-emily-graslie/|archivedate=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species is a [[grass skipper]] discovered in [[Ecuador]].

Andy Warren, senior collections manager of the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]]’s [[McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity]], said "We thought that after spending years explaining why specimens are important and bringing natural history collections to the attention of the public, Emily was definitely someone who should have a bug named after her."&lt;ref name="Bfly"/&gt;

The '''Finkbeiner test''' is a checklist proposed to help journalists avoid gender bias in media articles about women in science.

==Checklist==
The Finkbeiner test is a checklist proposed by journalist [[Christie Aschwanden]] to help journalists avoid [[gender bias]] in media articles about [[women in science]]. To pass the test, an article about a female scientist must not mention:
* That she is a woman
* Her husband's job
* Her childcare arrangements
* How she nurtures her underlings
* How she was taken aback by the competitiveness in her field
* How she is a role model for other women
* How she's the "first woman to..."&lt;ref name="CJR 22 March 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brainard|first=Curtis|title='The Finkbeiner Test' Seven rules to avoid gratuitous gender profiles of female scientists|url=http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/finkbeiner_test_gender_gap_fem.php?page=all|access-date=31 March 2013|newspaper=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Aschwanden formulated the test in an article in ''[[Double X Science]]'', an online science magazine for women, on 5 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.doublexscience.org/the-finkbeiner-test/|title=The Finkbeiner Test: What matters in stories about women scientists?|last=Aschwanden|first=Christie|date=5 March 2013|newspaper=Double X Science|access-date=31 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312212947/http://www.doublexscience.org/the-finkbeiner-test/|archive-date=12 March 2017|dead-url=bot: unknown|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She did so in response to what she considered was a type of media coverage of women scientists that:
{{Quote|treats its subject's sex as her most defining detail. She's not just a great scientist, she's a woman! And if she's also a wife and a mother, those roles get emphasized too.}}

Aschwanden created the test in the spirit of the [[Bechdel test]], which is used to indicate gender bias in fiction. She named the test after fellow journalist [[Ann Finkbeiner]], who had written a story&lt;ref&gt;Finkbeiner, Ann: {{cite web|url=http://www.lastwordonnothing.com/2013/01/17/5266/|title=What I'm Not Going to Do|date=17 January 2013|work=The Last Word On Nothing|access-date=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the science blog ''The Last Word on Nothing'' about her decision not to write about the subject of her latest article, an astronomer, "as a woman".&lt;ref name="CJR 22 March 2013" /&gt; 

==Reception==
The test was mentioned in the media criticism of the ''[[New York Times]]''{{'}}s obituary of rocket scientist [[Yvonne Brill]]. That obituary, published on 30 March 2013, by [[Douglas Martin (journalist)|Douglas Martin]], began with the words: "She made a mean [[Beef Stroganoff|beef stroganoff]], followed her husband from job to job and took eight years off from work to raise three children".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gonzalez|first=Robert T.|title=The New York Times fails miserably in its obituary for rocket scientist Yvonne Brill|url=http://io9.com/the-new-york-times-fails-miserably-in-its-obituary-for-464140204|access-date=31 March 2013|newspaper=[[io9]]|date=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few hours after publication the ''New York Times'' revised the obituary to address some of the criticisms; the revised version begins "She was a brilliant rocket scientist who followed her husband from job to job..."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NewsDiffs {{!}} Diffing: Yvonne Brill, a Pioneering Rocket Scientist, Dies at 88|url = http://www.newsdiffs.org/diff/192021/192137/www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/science/space/yvonne-brill-rocket-scientist-dies-at-88.html|website = www.newsdiffs.org|access-date = 14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another ''New York Times'' article, on [[Jennifer Doudna]], published on 11 May 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/science/jennifer-doudna-crispr-cas9-genetic-engineering.html?_r=0|title = Jennifer Doudna, A Pioneer Who Helped Simplify Genome Editing|date = 11 May 2015|access-date = 14 October 2015|website = New York Times|publisher = |last = Pollack|first = Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew similar criticism with reference to the Finkbeiner test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Problems With How We Talk About Female Scientists «  Berman Institute Bioethics Bulletin|url = http://bioethicsbulletin.org/archive/the-problem-with-how-we-talk-about-female-scientists|website = bioethicsbulletin.org|access-date = 14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An article in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' on astrophysicist [[Victoria Kaspi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/mcgill-astrophysicist-is-first-woman-to-win-canadas-top-science-award/article28762732/ |title=McGill astrophysicist is first woman to win Canada's top science award |first=Ivan |last=Semeniuk |date=16 February 2016 |work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; published on 16 February 2016, drew the same criticism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boundaryvision.com/2016/02/18/two-stories-same-scientist-gendered-coverage-of-the-herzberg-medal/ |title=Two stories, same scientist: Gender and coverage of the Herzberg medal |publisher=Boundary Vision |first=Marie-Claire |last=Shanahan |date=18 February 2016 | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[David Quammen]]'s book ''A Tangled Tree'', for giving women scientists, especially [[Lynn Margulis]], short shrift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The New York Times Book Review|first=Erika |last=Check Hayden|authorlink=Erika Check Hayden|title=A New View of Evolution That Can't Be Represented by a Tree |date=13 August 2018| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/books/review/david-quammen-tangled-tree.html |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan Gelman]], Professor of Psychology at the [[University of Michigan]], applauded the move to report on female scientists without emphasising their gender, but questions whether the Finkbeiner test should seek to eliminate all references to personal life, suggesting that the move should be towards asking male scientists about personal issues too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sexism In Science {{!}} Common Reader|url = https://commonreader.wustl.edu/sexism-science/|website = Common Reader|access-date = 14 October 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is shared by other writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Asking Questions and the "Finkbeiner Test"|url = http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2013/03/06/asking-questions-and-the-finkbeiner-test/|website = Uncertain Principles|access-date = 14 October 2015|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Vasudevan Mukunth points out in ''The Wire'', countries in which women are drastically under-represented in science might want to bend the test's rules in hopes of highlighting any systemic barriers: "The test's usefulness rests on the myth of a level playing field – there is none in India."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thewire.in/media/debate-test-used-spot-gender-bias-science-reports-can-myopic|title=Debate: Why a Test Used to Spot Gender Bias in Science Reports Can Be Myopic - The Wire|website=The Wire|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Variant==
The "Reversed Finkbeiner" approach is an exercise in which students are asked to write an article about a male scientist that would fail the Finkbeiner test if it were about a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Reversed Finkbeiner Test|url = http://www.futurescienceleaders.com/hjones/2015/03/the-reversed-finkbeiner-test/|website = www.futurescienceleaders.com|access-date = 14 October 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015004001/https://www.futurescienceleaders.com/hjones/2015/03/the-reversed-finkbeiner-test/ | archivedate=15 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Finkbeiner posts: round 2|url = http://genegeek.ca/2014/03/finkbeiner-posts-round-2/|website = genegeek|access-date = 14 October 2015|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2353">'''Gas immersion laser doping''' ('''GILD''') is a method of [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] a [[semiconductor]] material such as [[silicon]].

In the case of doping silicon with boron to create a [[P-type semiconductor]] material, a thin [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]] of silicon is placed in a containment chamber and is immersed in boron gas. A pulsed laser is directed at the silicon wafer and this results in localised melting and subsequent recrystalisation of the silicon wafer material, allowing boron atoms in the gas to diffuse into the molten sections of the silicon wafer.&lt;ref name="Gas immersion laser doping (GILD) for ultra-shallow junction formation"&gt;{{cite web |last1= |first1= |title= Gas immersion laser doping (GILD) for ultra-shallow junction formation |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040609003016687 |website=Elsevier ScienceDirect |location= |publisher= |date= |language=English |accessdate=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end result of this process is a silicon wafer with boron impurities, creating a P-type semiconductor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5165">'''Glycoinformatics''' is a field of [[bioinformatics]] that pertains to the study of [[carbohydrates]] involved in protein [[post-translational modification]]. It broadly includes (but is not restricted to) [[database]], [[software]], and [[algorithm]] development for the study of [[polysaccharide|carbohydrate structures]], [[glycoconjugates]], [[enzymatic]] carbohydrate [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] and [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]], as well as carbohydrate [[chemical interaction|interactions]]. Conventional usage of the term does not currently include the treatment of carbohydrates from the more well-known [[nutrition|nutritive]] aspect.

==Issues to consider==
[[File:ArabinoXylanBranchingSequence.PNG|thumb|The sequence of branching information in a [[arabinoxylan]] molecule.&lt;ref&gt;Dervilly-Pinel G, et al. (2004). Carbohydrate Polymers 55:171–177.&lt;/ref&gt; The carbohydrate structure is expressed as a sequence of numbers representing the branches in the main chain. As the complexity of the chain increases, the numerical representation of the carbohydrate becomes more complex.]]

Even though [[glycosylation]] is the most common form of protein modification, with highly complex carbohydrate structures, the bioinformatics on [[glycome]] is still very poor.&lt;ref&gt;Helenius A, Aebi M (2001) Intracellular
functions of N-linked glycans. Science 291:2364–2369 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kikuchi N, et al. (2005). Bioinformatics 21:1717–1718. http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/21/8/1717&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike proteins and nucleic acids which are linear, carbohydrates are often branched and extremely complex.&lt;ref&gt;Seeberger PH (2005). Nature 437:1239.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, just four sugars can be strung together to form more than 5 million different types of carbohydrates&lt;ref&gt;Service RF (2001). Science 291:805-806. http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/291/5505/805a&lt;/ref&gt; or nine different sugars may be assembled into 15 million possible four-sugar-chains.&lt;ref name="dove"&gt;Dove A (2001). Nature Biotechnology 19:913-917. http://www.columbia.edu/cu/biology/courses/w3034/LACpapers/bittersweetNatBiot01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also, the number of [[monosaccharides|simple sugars]] that make up [[glycans]] is more than the number of [[nucleotides]] that make up DNA or RNA. Therefore, it is more computationally expensive to evaluate their structures.&lt;ref&gt;von der Lieth CW, et al. (2011). EUROCarbDB: An open-access platform for glycoinformatics. Glycobiology 21:4:493–502&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the main constrains in the glycoinformatics is the difficulty of representing sugars in the sequence form especially due to their branching nature.&lt;ref name="dove" /&gt; Owing to the lack of a genetic blue print, carbohydrates do not have a "fixed" sequence. Instead, the sequence is largely determined by the presence of a variety of enzymes, their [[enzyme|kinetic differences]] and variations in the biosynthetic micro-environment of the cells. This increases the complexity of analysis and experimental reproducibility of the carbohydrate structure of interest.&lt;ref&gt; Lutteke T. (2012). The use of glycoinformatics in glycochemistry. Beilstein J. Org. Chem. 8:915–929. doi:10.3762/bjoc.8.104 &lt;/ref&gt; It is for this reason that carbohydrates are often considered as the "information poor" molecules.

==Databases==
Keeping an up to date database is not easy given that there are differences in naming, graphical representations, and what information is provided pertaining to a given structure.

'''Haplogroup A-P305''' also known as '''A1''' is a [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup]]. Like its parent haplogroup [[haplogroup A0-T]] (A-L1085), A1 includes the vast majority of living human males. It emerged in [[Africa]] approximately 161,300 years ago. &lt;ref name="yfull"/&gt; By comparison, members of its sole sibling [[subclade]], [[haplogroup A0]] – the only other primary subclade of haplogroup A0-T – are found mostly in  

Basal, undivergent A-P305* is largely restricted to populations native to [[Africa]], though a handful of cases have been reported in [[Europe]] and [[Western Asia]]. A-P305* is found at its highest rates in [[Gyele people|Bakola Pygmies]] (South [[Cameroon]]) at 8.3% and [[Berbers]] from [[Algeria]] at 1.5%&lt;ref name="Cruciani2011"/&gt; and in [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name="Scozzari2012"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Scozzari R, Massaia A, D'Atanasio E, etal |title=Molecular dissection of the basal clades in the human Y chromosome phylogenetic tree |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=7 |issue=11 |pages=e49170 |year=2012 |pmid=23145109 |pmc=3492319 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0049170 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0049170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clade also achieves high frequencies in the [[Bushmen]] [[hunter-gatherer]] populations of [[Southern Africa]], followed closely by many [[Nilotic]] groups in [[Eastern Africa]].

{{Refimprove|date=May 2012}}
During World War II, the Polish resistance '''[[Home Army]]''' (''Armia Krajowa''), which conducted military operations against occupying German forces, was also heavily involved in [[military intelligence|intelligence]] work. This included operations investigating the German ''[[Wunderwaffe]]'':  the '''[[V-1 flying bomb]]''' and the '''[[V-2 rocket]]'''. British intelligence received their first Polish report regarding the development of these weapons at [[Peenemünde]] in 1943.&lt;ref name="Garliński"&gt;{{cite book |last=Garliński|first=Józef|authorlink=Józef Garliński|title=Hitler's Last Weapons: The Underground War against the V1 and V2|year=1978|publisher=Times Books|location=New York|page=221|chapter=Appendix II}}FOOTNOTE:  Regarding the "widespread conviction" and Wojewódzki (pgs 18, 252) claim that :&lt;blockquote&gt;''Polish authorities in London received despatches and reports on the subject of Peenemünde as early as 1942,''&lt;/blockquote&gt; the archives of the VIth Bureau that remained in Polish hands after the war and which, as of 1984, were to be found complete in the Polish Underground Movement (1939-45) Study Trust in London. Among them is "not a single document from 1942 concerning the V-1 and the V-2, nor has any been entered in the day-book of the VIth Bureau", and the lack of documentation regarding the claim was confirmed by Colonel Protasewicz and Lieutenant Colonel Bohdan Zielinski, head of the Bureau of Military Studies in the Home Army Intelligence in Warsaw 1943-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reports==
[[Image:V-2 Bug.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Part of a V-2 rocket recovered from the [[Bug River]] after the war]]

By the summer of 1941 Home Army intelligence began receiving reports from its field units regarding some kind of secret tests being carried out by the Germans on the island of [[Usedom]] in the [[Baltic Sea]]. A special "Bureau" was formed within intelligence group "Lombard", charged with espionage inside the 3rd Reich and the Polish areas incorporated into it after 1939, to investigate the matter and to coordinate future actions. Specialized scientific expertise was provided to the group by the engineer [[Antoni Kocjan]], "Korona", a renowned pre-war [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]] constructor. Furthermore, as part of their operations the "Bureau" managed to recruit an Austrian Anti-Nazi, [[Roman Traeger]] (T-As2), who was serving as an NCO in the [[Wehrmacht]] and was stationed on Usedom. Trager provided the AK with more detailed information regarding the "flying torpedoes" and pinpointed [[Peenemünde]] on Usedom as the site of the tests. The information obtained led to the first report from the AK to the British which was purportedly written by [[Jerzy Chmielewski]], "Rafal", who was in charge of processing economic reports the "Lombard" group obtained.

==Operation Most III==
{{main article|Operation Most III}}
[[Image:Home Army intelligence on V1 and V2.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Intelligence reports on the V-1 and V-2]]
After V-2 flight testing began near the village of [[Blizna]], south of [[Mielec]] (the first launch from there was on November 5, 1943), the AK had a unique opportunity to gather more information and to intercept parts of test rockets (most of which did not explode).

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:V-2 Bug parts.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Parts of the recovered V-2 rocket]] --&gt;
The AK quickly located the new testing ground at Blizna thanks to reports from local farmers and AK field units, who managed to obtain on their own pieces of the fired rockets, by arriving on the scene before German patrols. In late 1943 in cooperation with British intelligence, a plan was formed to make an attempt to capture a whole unexploded V-2 rocket and transport it to Britain.

At the time, opinion within British intelligence was divided. One group tended to believe the AK accounts and reports, while another was highly sceptical and argued that it was impossible to launch a rocket of the size reported by the AK using any known fuel.
Then in early March 1944, British Intelligence Headquarters received a report of a Polish Underground worker (code name "Makary") who had crawled up to the [[Blizna]] railway line and saw on a flatcar heavily guarded by SS troops "an object which, though covered by a tarpaulin, bore every resemblance to a monstrous torpedo."&lt;ref name=McGovern&gt;{{cite book |last=McGovern|first=James|title=Crossbow and Overcast|year=1964|month= |publisher=W. Morrow|location=New York|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish intelligence also informed the British about usage of liquid oxygen in a radio report from June 12, 1944. Some experts within both British and Polish intelligence communities quickly realized that learning the nature of the fuel utilized by the rockets was crucial, and hence, the need to obtain a working example.

From April 1944, numerous test rockets were falling near Sarnaki village, in the vicinity of the [[Bug River]], south of [[Siemiatycze]]. The number of parts collected by the Polish intelligence increased. They were then analyzed by the Polish scientists in Warsaw. According to some reports, around May 20, 1944, a relatively undamaged V-2 rocket fell on the swampy bank of the Bug near Sarnaki and local Poles managed to hide it before German arrival. Subsequently, the rocket was dismantled and smuggled across Poland.&lt;ref name="Wojewódzki"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wojewódzki|first=Michał|title=Akcja V-1, V-2|year=1984|publisher= |location=Warsaw |language=Polish|isbn=83-211-0521-1|pages=}}  FOOTNOTE: there are no material evidence, nor first-hand reports on capturing a whole rocket in May 1944, only several second-hand ones. An Intelligence report from June 12 mentions only parts of a rocket.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Operation Most III]] (Bridge III) secretly transported parts of the rocket out of Poland for analysis by British intelligence.

==Impact on the course of the war==
While the early knowledge on a rocket by AK was quite a feat in pure intelligence terms, it did not necessarily translate into significant results on the ground. On the other hand, the AK did alert the British as to the dangers posed by both missile designs, which led them to allocate more resources to bombing production and launching sites and thus lessened the eventual devastation caused by them.  Also, the [[Bombing of Peenemünde in World War II|Operation Hydra]] bombing raid on Peenemünde, purportedly carried out on the basis of Home Army intelligence, did delay the V-2 by [[Operation Crossbow#Strategic bombing|six to eight weeks]].&lt;ref name=Middlebrook&gt;{{cite book |last=Middlebrook|first=Martin|authorlink= |title=The Peenemünde Raid: The Night of 17–18 August 1943|year=1982|publisher=Bobs-Merrill|location=New York|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18032">A '''homunculus''' ({{IPAc-en|h|oʊ|ˈ|m|ʌ|ŋ|k|j|ʊ|l|ə|s}}; [[Latin]] for "little person") is a representation of a small human being. Popularized in sixteenth-century [[alchemy]] and nineteenth-century fiction, it has historically referred to the creation of a miniature, fully formed human. The concept has roots in [[preformationism]] as well as earlier folklore and alchemic traditions.

==History==
===Alchemy===
[[File:Paracelsus219.jpg|upright|thumb|astadi
 with the first mention of the homunculus in ''De homunculis'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1529–1532), and ''De natura rerum'' (1537).]]
The homunculus first appears by name in [[alchemical]] writings attributed to [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541). ''De natura rerum'' (1537) outlines his method for creating homunculi:

{{quote|That the sperm of a man be putrefied by itself in a sealed cucurbit for forty days with the highest degree of putrefaction in a horse's womb, or at least so long that it comes to life and moves itself, and stirs, which is easily observed. After this time, it will look somewhat like a man [''sic''], but transparent, without a body. If, after this, it be fed wisely with the Arcanum of human blood, and be nourished for up to forty weeks, and be kept in the even heat of the horse's womb, a living human child grows therefrom, with all its members like another child, which is born of a woman, but much smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Grafton|first = Anthony|title = Natural Particulars: Nature and the Disciplines in Renaissance Europe|publisher = MIT Press|year = 1999|pages=328–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Comparisons have been made with several similar concepts in the writings of earlier alchemists. Although the actual word "homunculus" was never used, [[Carl Jung]] believed that the concept first appeared in the ''Visions of Zosimos'', written in the third century AD. In the visions, [[Zosimos of Panopolis|Zosimos]] encounters a priest who changes into "the opposite of himself, into a mutilated ''anthroparion''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Jung|first = Carl|title = Alchemical Studies|year = 1967|page = 60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word "anthroparion" is similar to "homunculus" &amp;ndash; a diminutive form of "person". Zosimos subsequently encounters other anthroparion in his dream but there is no mention of the creation of artificial life. In his commentary, Jung equates the homunculus with the [[Philosopher's Stone]], and the "inner person" in parallel with [[Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Jung|first = Carl|title = Alchemical Studies|year = 1967|page = 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Islamic alchemy]], ''[[Takwin]]'' ({{lang-ar|تكوين}}) was a goal of certain [[Muslim]] alchemists, a notable one being [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]]. In the alchemical context, ''Takwin'' refers to the artificial creation of life in the [[laboratory]], up to and including human life.

The homunculus continued to appear in alchemical writings after Paracelsus' time. The ''[[Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz]]'' (1616) for example, concludes with the creation of a male and female form identified as ''Homunculi duo''. The allegorical text suggests to the reader that the ultimate goal of alchemy is not [[chrysopoeia]], but it is instead the artificial generation of humans. Here, the creation of homunculi symbolically represents spiritual regeneration and [[Christian soteriology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Grafton|first = Anthony|title = Natural Particulars: Nature and the Disciplines in Renaissance Europe|publisher = MIT Press|year = 1999|pages=321–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1775, Count Johann Ferdinand von&amp;nbsp;Kufstein, together with Abbé Geloni, an Italian cleric, are reputed to have created ten homunculi with the ability to foresee the future, which von&amp;nbsp;Kufstein kept in glass containers at his [[Masonic lodge]] in [[Vienna]]. Dr.&amp;nbsp;Emil Besetzny's Masonic handbook, ''Die Sphinx'', devoted an entire chapter to the ''wahrsagenden Geister'' (scrying ghosts). These are reputed to have been seen by several people, including local dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;Besetzny, Emil. (1873). ''Die Sphinx'', pp.&amp;nbsp;111–157. Vienna.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phx-ult-lodge.org/life_of_paracelsus.htm Hartmann, Franz. (1896). ''The Life of Paracelsus'', p.&amp;nbsp;306. London.] accessed 13&amp;nbsp;March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folklore===
References to the homunculus do not appear prior to sixteenth-century alchemical writings;{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} however, alchemists may have been influenced by earlier folk traditions. The [[mandrake|mandragora]], known in German as ''Alreona'', ''Alraun'' or ''Alraune'' is one example.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

In ''Liber de imaginibus'', [[Paracelsus]] however denies that roots shaped like men grow naturally. He attacks dishonest people who carve roots to look like men and sell them as Alraun. He clarifies that the homunculus’ origins are in sperm, and that it is falsely confused with these ideas from necromancy and natural philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Grafton|first = Anthony|title = Natural Particulars: Nature and the Disciplines in Renaissance Europe|publisher = MIT Press|year = 1999|pages=331–332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The homunculus has also been compared to the [[golem]] of Jewish folklore. Though the specifics outlining the creation of the golem and homunculus are very different, the concepts both metaphorically relate man to the divine, in his construction of life in his own image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Campbell|first = Mary Baine|title = Artificial Men: Alchemy, Transubstantiation, and the Homunculus|journal = Republics of Letters: A Journal for the Study of Knowledge, Politics, and the Arts|volume = 1|issue = 2|url = http://rofl.stanford.edu/node/61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preformationism===
{{main|Preformationism}}
[[File:Preformation.GIF|thumb|upright|A tiny person inside a sperm as drawn by [[Nicolaas Hartsoeker]] in 1695]]
Preformationism is the formerly-popular theory that animals developed from miniature versions of themselves. Sperm were believed to contain complete preformed individuals called "[[animalcules]]". Development was therefore a matter of enlarging this into a fully formed being. The term homunculus was later used in the discussion of conception and birth.

[[Nicolas Hartsoeker]] postulated the existence of animalcules in the semen of humans and other animals. This was the beginning of spermists' theory, who held the belief that the sperm was in fact a "little man" that was placed inside a woman for growth into a child. This seemed to them to neatly explain many of the mysteries of conception. It was later pointed out that if the sperm was a homunculus, identical in all but size to an adult, then the homunculus may have sperm of its own. This led to a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' with a chain of homunculi "[[Turtles all the way down|all the way down]]". This was not necessarily considered by spermists a fatal objection however, as it neatly explained how it was that "in Adam" [[original sin|all had sinned]]: the whole of humanity was already contained in his loins. The spermists' theory also failed to explain why children tend to resemble their mothers as well as their fathers, though some spermists believed that the growing homunculus assimilated maternal characteristics from the womb environment in which they grew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=Epigenesis and Preformationism |date=October 11, 2005 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epigenesis/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminological use in modern science==
{{Main|Cortical homunculus}}
The homunculus is commonly used today in scientific disciplines such as [[psychology]] as a teaching or memory tool to describe the distorted [[scale model]] of a human drawn or sculpted to reflect the relative space human body parts occupy on the [[somatosensory cortex]] (the "sensory homunculus") and the [[motor cortex]] (the "motor homunculus"). Both the motor and sensory homunculi usually appear as small men superimposed over the top of precentral or postcentral [[gyrus|gyri]] for motor and sensory cortices, respectively. The homunculus is oriented with feet medial and shoulders lateral on top of both the precentral and the postcentral gyrus (for both motor and sensory). The man's head is depicted upside down in relation to the rest of the body such that the forehead is closest to the shoulders. The lips, hands, feet and sex organs have more sensory neurons than other parts of the body, so the homunculus has correspondingly large lips, hands, feet, and genitals. The motor homunculus is very similar to the sensory homunculus, but differs in several ways. Specifically, the motor homunculus has a portion for the tongue most lateral while the sensory homunculus has an area for genitalia most medial and an area for visceral organs most lateral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Saladin|first = Kenneth|title = Anatomy and Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function, 6th Edition|publisher = McGraw-Hill|year = 2012|url = |isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brainconnection.positscience.com/topics/?main=anat/motor-anat |title=BrainConnection.com - The Anatomy of Movement |publisher=Brainconnection.positscience.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well known in the field of neurology, this is also commonly called "the little man inside the brain." This scientific model is known as the [[cortical homunculus]].

In medical science, the term homunculus is sometimes applied to certain [[fetus]]-like ovarian cystic [[teratoma]]e. These will sometimes contain hair, sebaceous material and in some cases [[cartilage|cartilagous]] or [[bone|bony]] structures.&lt;ref&gt;Yong Ho Lee, Y.H, Kim, S.G., Choi, S.H., Kim, I.S. &amp; Kim, S.H. (2003). Ovarian mature cystic teratoma containing homunculus: A case report. ''Journal of Korean Medical Science'', no.&amp;nbsp;18: pp.&amp;nbsp;905-907. [http://jkms.kams.or.kr/2003/pdf/12905.pdf Article as PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722140946/http://jkms.kams.or.kr/2003/pdf/12905.pdf |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early literature===
[[File:Faust image 19thcentury.jpg|thumb|upright|19th-century engraving of Goethe's Faust and Homunculus]]
Homunculi can be found in centuries worth of literature. These fictions are primarily centred around imaginative speculations on the quest for artificial life associated with [[Paracelsianism|Paracelsian]] alchemy. One of the very earliest literary references occurs in [[Thomas Browne]]'s ''[[Religio Medici]]'' (1643), in which the author states:
{{quote|I am not of Paracelsus minde that boldly delivers a receipt to make a man without conjunction,&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Browne. ''Religio Medici''. 1643. Part&amp;nbsp;1: 35&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The fable of the alchemically-created homunculus may have been central in [[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818). Professor [[Radu Florescu]] suggests that [[Johann Conrad Dippel]], an alchemist born in Castle Frankenstein, might have been the inspiration for Victor Frankenstein. German playwright [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''[[Faust, Part Two]]'' (1832) famously features an alchemically-created homunculus.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Poet lore; a quarterly of world literature'' 1889 p. 269ff [https://archive.org/stream/poetlorequarterl13bost#page/268/mode/2up  ''A Faust Problem: What was the Homunculus?''] and Faust by Goethe [https://archive.org/stream/fausttragedytran00goetuoft#page/352/mode/2up/search/Homunculus Faust p. 350ff]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the character of Homunculus embodies the quest of a pure spirit to be born into mortal form, contrasting Faust's desire to shed his mortal body to become pure spirit. The alchemical idea that the soul is not imprisoned in the body, but instead may find its brightest state as it passes through the material plane is central to the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Latimer|first = Dan|title = Homunculus as Symbol: Semantic and Dramatic Functions of the Figure in Goethe's Faust|publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press|journal = MLN|volume = 89|issue = 5|year = 1974|pages=814|doi=10.2307/2907086}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[William Makepeace Thackeray]] wrote under the pen name of Homunculus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011984771 John Bull and his wonderful lamp: a new reading of an old tale] by Homunculus.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary literature===
The homunculus legend, ''Frankenstein'' and ''Faust'' have continued to influence works in the twentieth and twenty-first century.  The theme has been used not only in [[fantasy literature]], but also to illuminate social topics. For instance, the British children's writers [[Mary Norton (author)|Mary Norton]] and [[Rumer Godden]] used homunculus motifs in their work, expressing various post-war anxieties about refugees, persecution of minorities in war, and the adaptation of these minorities to a "big" world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1959.14/76602  |title=Post-war place and displacement in Rumer Godden's "The Doll's house" and Mary Norton's "The Borrowers"|last=Dubosarsky |first=Ursula|work=CREArTA |volume=6 |issue=Special Issue |pages=103–107|year=2006 |accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s 1908 novel [[The Magician (Maugham novel)|''The Magician'']] utilises the concept of the homunculus as an important plot element. [[David H. Keller]]’s short story "A Twentieth-Century Homunculus" (1930) describes the creation of homunculi on an industrial scale by a pair of [[misogynists]]. Likewise, [[Sven Delblanc]]’s ''The Homunculus: A Magic Tale'' (1965) addresses misogyny and the Cold War industrial-military complexes of the Soviet Union and [[NATO]].

===Other media===
Homunculi appear in fantasy based television, film, and games in a manner consistent with literature. Examples can be found in numerous mediums, such as the films ''[[Homunculus (film)|Homunculus]]'' (1916), ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935), ''[[The Golden Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1973), the television movie ''[[Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (1973 film)|Don't Be Afraid of the Dark]]'' (1973), ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'' (1999), Guillermo del Toro's ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]'' (2001), J.K. Rowling’s ''[[Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald]]'' (2018), and the big-screen remake of ''[[Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2010 film)|Don't Be Afraid of the Dark]]'' (2011), fantasy role-playing games (such as ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''), [[video game]]s (such as ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'', ''[[Valkyrie Profile]]'', '' [[Shadow of Memories]]'', ''[[The Legend of Heroes series]]'', ''[[Cabals: Magic &amp; Battle Cards]]''), books (such as ''[[The Secret Series]]''), graphic novels (such as ''[[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense]]'') and manga (such as ''[[Homunculus (manga)|Homunculus]]'', ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', Fate/Zero, and ''[[Gosick]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3094">'''Inspection time''' refers to the exposure duration required for a human subject to reliably identify a simple stimulus. Typically a stimulus made up of two parallel lines differing in length and joined at the tops by a cross bar is presented (similar to the Greek letter [[Pi (letter)|Pi]]). The ability to quickly detect the identity of a stimulus is moderately [[heritability|heritable]]&lt;ref name=luciano&gt;M. Luciano, D. Posthuma, M. J. Wright, E. J. de Geus, G. A. Smith, G. M. Geffen, D. I. Boomsma and N. G. Martin. (2005). Perceptual speed does not cause intelligence, and intelligence does not cause perceptual speed. ''Biol Psychol'', '''70''', 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; and correlates with the subject's [[IQ]].&lt;ref name=nettelbeck&gt;T. Nettelbeck and M. Lally. (1976). Inspection Time and Measured Intelligence. ''British Journal of Psychology'', '''67''', 17-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
If asked which of the two lines in the figure below is longer; the left or the right, almost all non-visually impaired subjects can answer correctly 100% of the time. If, however, the stimulus is [[backward masking|backward masked]] after a short period of time, the proportion of correct responses declines as the exposure duration reduces, and reliable individual differences emerge in the percent identified correctly at different intervals.

The task itself was proposed by [[Doug Vickers]] as a measure of the rate of accumulation of information.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vickers and P. L. Smith. (1986). The rationale for the inspection time index. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', '''7''', 609-623.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ted Nettelbeck]], [[Chris Brand]] and others demonstrated it related quite strongly to psychometric intelligence, especially across the lower part of the IQ range &lt;ref name=nettelbeck/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;I. J. Deary and C. Stough. (1996). Intelligence and inspection time - Achievements, prospects, and problems. ''American Psychologist'', '''51''', [https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.51.6.599 599-608] &lt;/ref&gt;
suggesting that differences in intelligence may reflect, in part, differences in the rate of [[information processing]] - a theory proposed by [[Arthur Jensen]].&lt;ref&gt;A. R. Jensen. (1993). Why is reaction time correlated with psychometric g? ''Current Directions in Psychological Science'', '''2''', [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770697 53-56] &lt;/ref&gt;


One version of the inspection time stimuli is shown below (1) with the stimulus (short left given as an example), which is replaced by a mask (2). (3) indicates the opportunity for the subject to report which stimulus they saw at their leisure.

==Genetics==
Inspection time is moderately [[heritability|heritable]].&lt;ref name=luciano/&gt; This work on the heritability of IT from [[Nick Martin (scientist)|Nick Martin]]'s group also demonstrated, however, that perceptual speed does not have a causal role in [[intelligence]], but rather that IQ and IT are distinct reflections of some shared biological processes.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

[[File:International Futures Logo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|right|International Futures (IFs) Logo]]

'''International Futures (IFs)''' is a global [[integrated assessment modelling|integrated assessment model]] designed to help in thinking strategically and systematically about key global systems (economic, demographic, education, health, environment, technology, domestic governance, infrastructure, agriculture, energy and environment) housed at the Frederick S. Pardee Center for International Futures. Initially created by [[Barry B. Hughes]] of the [[Josef Korbel School of International Studies]] at the [[University of Denver]] in [[Colorado]],&lt;ref&gt;Documentation can be found at http://www.ifs.du.edu regarding the history of IFs, specifically http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/IfsWebSite/IFs%20History.htm gives an overview of the different generations of IFs development.  See this for a TEDx talk about the model:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at47WLuA8Ks&lt;/ref&gt; the model is free for public use in both its online and downloadable forms.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Hughes,and  Evan Hillebrand  Paradigm Publishing, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Pardee Center for International Futures has partnered with many organizations to produce forecasts and data analysis.  IFs has been utilized in the [[National Intelligence Council|National Intelligence Council's]] ''Global Trends 2020'', ''Global Trends 2025'', and ''Global Trends 2030'' report.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.foia.cia.gov/2020/2020.pdf ''Mapping the Future: Report of the National Intelligence Council's 2020 Report'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916051336/http://www.foia.cia.gov/2020/2020.pdf |date=2012-09-16 }} and [http://www.aicpa.org/research/cpahorizons2025/globalforces/downloadabledocuments/globaltrends.pdf ''Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813062044/http://www.aicpa.org/research/cpahorizons2025/globalforces/downloadabledocuments/globaltrends.pdf |date=2012-08-13 }} and [http://www.dni.gov/index.php/carousel-items/778-global-trends-2030-alternative-worlds-available-for-download ''Global Trends 2030:  Alternative Worlds''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215110105/http://www.dni.gov/index.php/carousel-items/778-global-trends-2030-alternative-worlds-available-for-download |date=2012-12-15 }} [[Director of National Intelligence]]&lt;/ref&gt; The International Futures model has also contributed to the United Nations ''[[Human Development Report]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr2011/papers/HDRP_2011_08.pdf ''Forecasting the Impacts of Environmental Constraints on Human Development'']&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Global Environment Outlook|Global Environmental Outlook]]''.

IFs is hosted free for public use by [[Google Public Data Explorer]], the [[Atlantic Council]], and the [[Institute for Security Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;For hosts of the web-based version of the model, see International Futures on [http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=n4ff2muj8bh2a_ Google Public Data Explorer], The Atlantic Council and the [http://www.acus.org/program/strategic-foresight-initiative Strategic Foresight Initiative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115045307/http://www.acus.org/program/strategic-foresight-initiative |date=2012-11-15 }}, and the Institute for Security Studies, as a part of the [http://www.issafrica.org/futures African Futures Project].  Additionally, the web version of the model is found on the [http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/Ifs.aspx International Futures] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model structure ==
The model incorporates  dynamically linked  sub-models.  They include:  population, economic, agricultural, educational, energy, socio-political, international political, environmental, health, infrastructure and  technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifs.du.edu/introduction/elements.aspx Elements of International Futures], a structural explanation of the IFs model with block diagram.&lt;/ref&gt;  IFs is a unique modeling tool because it endogenizes the impact of such a wide range of global systems for 183 countries.

The help system that accompanies the software&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; provides an extensive overview of the model structure and computer code used to write the model.  IFs has three main functions, all connected to its conceptual treatment of integrated assessment forecasts: data analysis, scenario analysis, and display.&lt;ref&gt;An extended introductory video is found here:  http://vimeo.com/11090851&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data analysis ==
[[File:Crosssect.jpg|thumb|right|Example of cross-sectional analysis of [[total fertility rate]] and [[GDP]] per capita at [[purchasing power parity]]]]
The data analysis section of IFs represents a collection of over 2,000 data series from all major international data gatherers.  It is constantly updated with new data series.  This data forms the foundation of the model structure.  Users can analyze historic data cross-sectionally, longitudinally or on a [[world map]].  Using [[cross-sectional analysis]], users can  select a [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] and plot this against up to 5 [[independent variables]].  It is then possible to animate the map to see how the cross-sectional relationship changes across the 40+ years of data in the [[database]].  Longitudinally, users can plot the relationship between a [[dependent variable]] and time, from 1960 (for most data series) through the most recent data year available.  A world map allows users to display data from any of these series using [[GIS]] options.

== Scenario analysis ==
[[File:IFsWorldPopulationHistoryForecastII.jpg|thumb|right| Forecast of world population for four [[UNEP]] scenarios from 1960&amp;ndash;2100]]

The software allows users to access and change the [[parameters]] and [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] that are used in the model. The [[scenario analysis|Scenario Analysis]] display lets users create their own global scenario or load a pre-run global scenario in their field of interest.  For example, to analyze the effects of a policy intervention on different sub-models and variables within the model, make the changes to the appropriate variable and then analyze the results in comparison to the base-case.  Many pre-run scenarios come packaged with the model, including work that has been completed for the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.unep.org/geo/GEO4/report/GEO-4_Report_Full_en.pdf ''Global Environmental Outlook 4''] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090707225845/http://www.unep.org/geo/geo4/report/GEO-4_Report_Full_en.pdf |date=2009-07-07 }} that IFs made a contribution to&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Intelligence Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foia.cia.gov/2020/2020.pdf ''Mapping the Future: Report of the National Intelligence Council's 2020 Report'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916051336/http://www.foia.cia.gov/2020/2020.pdf |date=2012-09-16 }} and [http://www.aicpa.org/research/cpahorizons2025/globalforces/downloadabledocuments/globaltrends.pdf ''Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813062044/http://www.aicpa.org/research/cpahorizons2025/globalforces/downloadabledocuments/globaltrends.pdf |date=2012-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Display ==
[[File:Mortalitydisplay.jpg|thumb|right|Example of mortality display for Belgium in 2025]]
This portion of the software allows users to display the forecast results of their scenario analyses for different provinces, countries and groups across different issue areas.  Some of the specialized displays include: population, educational attainment, mortality rate, [[World Values Survey]], [[Gini coefficient]], the [[Millennium Development Goals]], [[social accounting matrix]], advanced sustainability analysis, and [[World Bank]] financial flows.

== Pardee Center for International Futures ==

The  project received a gift from [[Frederick S. Pardee]], formerly of [[RAND]], to construct the '''Pardee Center for International Futures''' at the [[University of Denver]].&lt;ref&gt;at {{cite web |url=http://www.ifs.du.edu/pardee/index.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902033255/http://www.ifs.du.edu/pardee/index.aspx |archivedate=2012-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is responsible for the further institutionalization of the software, training sessions, and the continued work on the ''Patterns of Potential Human Progress'' (PPHP) volumes.  The first PPHP volume discusses reduction in global poverty; the second, global education; the third, health care systems; the fourth, global infrastructure; the fifth, domestic governance.&lt;ref&gt;These can be downloaded either in final or draft form on their website "http://www.ifs.du.edu/documents/index.aspx"&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal [[Poverty and Public Policy]] reviewed the first PPHP volume, and concluded the following:

:For all their fine effort in data assembly and analysis, Hughes et al. intended that their first volume’s main contribution should be one not of prediction, but of promoting thought about poverty policy. Their attractively presented and lucid volume succeeds in this endeavor; it very usefully fulfills its promise to the student and policymaker.&lt;ref&gt;Soltys, Dennis (2010) “Review of Reducing Global Poverty: Patterns of Potential Human Progress, Vol. 1," Poverty &amp; Public Policy: Vol. 2: Iss. 2, Article 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== African Futures Project ==

The African Futures Project is a collaboration between the [[Institute for Security Studies]] and the Pardee Center for International Futures to promote long term strategic planning for African development.  This collaboration has led to the publication of various African Futures Project Policy Briefs,&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.issafrica.org/futures/publications.php Publications Section] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006215455/http://www.issafrica.org/futures/publications.php |date=2013-10-06 }} of the African Futures website for introductory videos and to read the policy briefs in full.&lt;/ref&gt; monographs on long-term African Development and a website where the IFs model can be used specifically for exploring African development.&lt;ref&gt;See the African Futures Project at: {{cite web |url=http://www.iss.co.za/futures/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403153619/http://www.iss.co.za/futures/ |archivedate=2013-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine''''' was the first English-language journal on the subject of [[traditional Chinese medicine]], including [[acupuncture]], [[herbal medicine]], [[homeopathy]], [[massotherapy]], [[mind-body therapy|mind-body therapies]], [[palliative care]] and other topics in [[complementary and alternative medicine]].

The journal was original established in Chinese as ''Chung i tsa chih ying wen pan'' in 1955. The English edition of the ''Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine'' was first published in 1981. It is jointly sponsored and published by the [[China Association of Chinese Medicine]] and the [[China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences]]. Its headquarters are in Beijing. The journal is also published in German, Italian, Spanish, French and Portuguese editions.

'''Learning theories''' are [[conceptual framework]]s that describe how students absorb, process, and retain knowledge during [[learning]].&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;Simandan, D., 2013. Introduction: Learning as a geographical process. The Professional Geographer, 65(3), pp.363-368. https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00330124.2012.693872&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive, emotional, and environmental influences, as well as prior experience, all play a part in how understanding, or a world view, is acquired or changed and knowledge and skills retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Illeris | first = Knud | title = The three dimensions of learning | publisher = Krieger Pub. Co | location = Malabar, Fla | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781575242583 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ormrod | first = Jeanne | title = Human learning | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston | year = 2012|edition = 6th | isbn = 9780132595186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviorists look at learning as an aspect of [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]] and advocate a system of rewards and targets in education. Educators who embrace [[Cognitivism (learning theory)|cognitive theory]] believe that the definition of learning as a change in behavior is too narrow, and study the learner rather than their environment—and in particular the complexities of human [[memory]]. Those who advocate [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] believe that a learner's ability to learn relies largely on what they already know and understand, and the acquisition of knowledge should be an individually tailored process of construction. [[Transformative learning]] theory focuses on the often-necessary change required in a learner's preconceptions and world view. Geographical learning theory focuses on the ways that contexts and environments shape the learning process.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2013. Learning wisdom through geographical dislocations. The Professional Geographer, 65(3), pp.390-395. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00330124.2012.693876&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Godlewska, A., 2013. Dislocation pedagogy. The Professional Geographer, 65(3), pp.384-389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the realm of [[educational psychology]], techniques to directly observe the functioning of the brain during the learning process, such as [[event-related potential]] and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], are used in [[educational neuroscience]]. The [[theory of multiple intelligences]], where learning is seen as the interaction between dozens of different functional areas in the brain each with their own individual strengths and weaknesses in any particular human learner, has also been proposed, but empirical research has found the theory to be unsupported by evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Willingham |first1=Daniel T. |authorlink1=Daniel T.

==Educational philosophy==

===Classical theorists===

====Plato====
{{Main article|Plato}}
[[Plato]] (428 BC–347 BC) proposed the question: How does an individual learn something new when the topic is brand new to that person?  This question may seem trivial; however, think of a human like a computer.  The question would then become: How does a computer take in any factual information without previous programming?  Plato answered his own question by stating that knowledge is present at birth and all information learned by a person is merely a recollection of something the soul has already learned previously,&lt;ref name="Phillips2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.C. Phillips |author2= Jonas F. Soltis|title=Perspectives on Learning |edition= 5th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVzUtECrJ2IC|year=2009 |publisher=Teachers College Press|isbn=978-0-8077-7120-4 |series=Thinking About Education }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is called the Theory of Recollection or [[Platonic epistemology]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Silverman, Allan|title=Plato's Middle Period Metaphysics and Epistemology|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|edition=Fall 2014|editor=Edward N. Zalta| url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/plato-metaphysics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This answer could be further justified by a paradox: If a person knows something, they don't need to question it, and if a person does not know something, they don't know to question it.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;  Plato says that if one did not previously know something, then they cannot learn it.  He describes learning as a passive process, where information and knowledge are ironed into the soul over time.  However, Plato's theory elicits even more questions about knowledge: If we can only learn something when we already had the knowledge impressed onto our souls, then how did our souls gain that knowledge in the first place?  Plato's theory can seem convoluted; however, his classical theory can still help us understand knowledge today.&lt;ref name="Phillips2009" /&gt;

====Locke====
{{Main article|John Locke}}
[[John Locke]] (1632–1704) offered an answer to Plato's question as well.  John Locke offered the "blank slate" theory where humans are born into the world with no innate knowledge.  He recognized that something had to be present, however.  This something, to John Locke, seemed to be "mental powers".  Locke viewed these powers as a biological ability the baby is born with, similar to how a baby knows how to biologically function when born.  So as soon as the baby enters the world, it immediately has experiences with its surroundings and all of those experiences are being transcribed to the baby's "slate".  All of the experiences then eventually culminate into complex and abstract ideas.  This theory can still help teachers understand their students' learning today.&lt;ref name="Phillips2009" /&gt;

==Educational psychology==
{{Main article|Educational psychology}}

=== Behavior analysis ===
{{Main article|Behaviorism|Applied behavior analysis}}
The term "behaviorism" was coined by [[John B. Watson|John Watson]] (1878–1959). Watson believed the behaviorist view is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science with a goal to predict and control behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, D.C., Soltis, J.F., Perspectives on learning pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Good and Brophey|title=Realistic Approach|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in the ''[[Psychological Review]]'', he stated that, "Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, D.C. &amp; Soltis, J.F. (2009). Perspectives on Learning (Fifth). New York: Teachers College Press. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Methodological behaviorism is based on the theory of only explaining public events, or observable behavior. [[B.F. Skinner]] introduced another type of behaviorism called [[radical behaviorism]], or the conceptual analysis of behavior, which is based on the theory of also explaining private events; particularly, thinking and feelings. Radical behaviorism forms the conceptual piece of behavior analysis.

In behavior analysis, learning is the acquisition of a new behavior through conditioning and social learning.

====Learning and conditioning====
There are three types of conditioning and learning:
* [[Classical conditioning]], where the behavior becomes a reflex response to an antecedent stimulus.
* [[Operant conditioning]], where antecedent stimuli results from the consequences that follow the behavior through a reward (reinforcement) or a punishment.
* [[Social learning theory]], where an observation of behavior is followed by modeling.

[[Ivan Pavlov]] discovered classical conditioning. He observed that if dogs come to associate the delivery of food with a white lab coat or the ringing of a bell, they produce saliva, even when there is no sight or smell of food. Classical conditioning considers this form of learning the same, whether in dogs or in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Myers, David G.]]|title=Exploring Psychology|year=2008|publisher=Worth|location=New York, New York|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Operant conditioning]] reinforces this behavior with a reward or a punishment. A reward increases the likelihood of the behavior recurring, a punishment decreases its likelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Myers|first=David G.|title=Exploring Psychology|year=2008|publisher=Worth|location=New York, New York|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social learning theory observes behavior and is followed with modeling.

These three learning theories form the basis of [[applied behavior analysis]], the application of behavior analysis, which uses analyzed antecedents, [[functional analysis]], replacement behavior strategies, and often data collection and reinforcement to change behavior. The old practice was called behavior modification, which only used ''assumed'' antecedents and consequences to change behavior without acknowledging the conceptual analysis; analyzing the function of behavior and teaching of new behaviors that would serve the same function was never relevant in behavior modification.

Behaviorists view the learning process as a change in behavior, and arrange the environment to elicit desired responses through such devices as behavioral objectives, [[Competency-based learning]], and skill development and training.&lt;ref name="Smith 1999"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=M.K.|title=Learning Theory, the encyclopedia of informal education|url=http://www.infed.org/biblio/b-learn.htm|publisher=the encyclopedia of informal education|accessdate=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educational approaches such as Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention, [[curriculum-based measurement]], and [[direct instruction]] have emerged from this model.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, T and Axelrod, S. (2005): "Direct Instruction: An Educators' Guide and a Plea for Action" - ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 6.(2), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transfer of learning====

Transfer of [[learning]] is the idea that what one learns in school somehow carries over to situations different from that particular time and that particular setting.&lt;ref name="Kleibard, H. 2004 pp. 77-105"&gt;Kleibard, H. (2004). Scientific curriculum-making and the rise of social efficiency. In ''The Struggle for American Curriculum'' (pp. 77-105).&lt;/ref&gt; Transfer was amongst the first phenomena tested in [[educational psychology]]. Edward Lee Thorndike was a pioneer in transfer research. He found that though transfer is extremely important for learning, it is a rarely occurring phenomenon. In fact, he held an experiment where he had the subjects estimate the size of a specific shape and then he would switch the shape. He found that the prior information did not help the subjects; instead it impeded their [[learning]].&lt;ref name="Kleibard, H. 2004 pp. 77-105"/&gt;

One explanation of why transfer does not occur often involves surface structure and deep structure. The surface structure is the way a problem is framed. The deep structure is the steps for the solution. For example, when a math story problem changes contexts from asking how much it costs to reseed a lawn to how much it costs to varnish a table, they have different surface structures, but the steps for getting the answers are the same. However, many people are more influenced by the surface structure. In reality, the surface structure is unimportant. Nonetheless, people are concerned with it because they believe that it provides background knowledge on how to do the problem. Consequently, this interferes with their understanding of the deep structure of the problem. Even if somebody tries to concentrate on the deep structure, transfer still may be unsuccessful because the deep structure is not usually obvious. Therefore, surface structure gets in the way of people's ability to see the deep structure of the problem and transfer the [[knowledge]] they have learned to come up with a solution to a new problem.&lt;ref name="Willingham, D. T. 2009"&gt;Willingham, D. T. (2009). Why don't students like school? San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Current [[learning]] pedagogies focus on conveying rote [[knowledge]], independent of the context that gives it meaning{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. Because of this, students often struggle to transfer this stand-alone information into other aspects of their [[education]]. Students need much more than abstract concepts and self-contained [[knowledge]]; they need to be exposed to [[learning]] that is practiced in the context of authentic activity and [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, John S., Allan Collins, and Paul Duguid. "Situated Cognition and the Culture of Learning." Educational Researcher 18.1 (1989): 32-42. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of situated cognition, however, would argue that by discrediting stand-alone information, the transfer of [[knowledge]] across contextual boundaries becomes impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Sfard, A. (1998, March). On two metaphors for [[learning]] and the dangers of choosing just one. Educational Researcher, 4-13.&lt;/ref&gt; There must be a balance between situating knowledge while also grasping the deep structure of material, or the understanding of how one arrives to know such information.&lt;ref name="Willingham, D. T. 2009"/&gt;

Some theorists argue that transfer does not even occur at all. They believe that students transform what they have learned into the new context. They say that transfer is too much of a passive notion. They believe students, instead, transform their [[knowledge]] in an active way. Students don't simply carry over knowledge from the classroom, but they construct the knowledge in a way that they can understand it themselves.The learner changes the information they have learned to make it best adapt to the changing contexts that they use the [[knowledge]] in. This transformation process can occur when a learner feels motivated to use the knowledge—however, if the student does not find the transformation necessary, it is less likely that the knowledge will ever transform &lt;ref&gt;Larsen-Freeman, D. (2013). Transfer of learning transformed.''Language Learning: A Journal of Research in Language Studies,'' 63:S1. Retrieved from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9922.2012.00740.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

====Techniques and benefits of transfer of learning====

There are many different conditions that influence transfer of learning in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Cormier, S.M 2014"&gt;Cormier, S.M. and Hagman, J.D. eds., 2014. Transfer of learning: Contemporary research and applications. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions include features of the task, features of the learner, features of the organization and social context of the activity.&lt;ref name="McKeough, A. 2013"&gt;McKeough, A., 2013. Teaching for transfer: Fostering generalization in learning. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The features of the task include practicing through simulations, problem-based learning, and knowledge and skills for implementing new plans.&lt;ref name="McKeough, A. 2013"/&gt; The features of learners include their ability to reflect on past experiences, their ability to participate in group discussions, practice skills, and participate in written discussions. All the unique features contribute to a student's ability to use transfer of learning.&lt;ref name="Cormier, S.M 2014"/&gt; There are structural techniques that can aid learning transfer in the classroom. These structural strategies include hugging and bridging.&lt;ref name="Harris, S. 2008"&gt;Harris, S., Lowery-Moore, H., &amp; Farrow, V. (2008). Extending Transfer of Learning Theory to Transformative Learning Theory: A Model for Promoting Teacher Leadership. Theory Into Practice, 47(4), 318-326. doi:10.1080/00405840802329318&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugging uses the technique of simulating an activity to encourage reflexive learning. An example of the hugging strategy is when a student practices teaching a lesson or when a student role plays with another student. These examples encourage critical thinking that engages the student and helps them understand what they are learning—one of the goals of transfer of learning&lt;ref name="Harris, S. 2008"/&gt; and [[desirable difficulties]].

Bridging is when instruction encourages thinking abstractly by helping to identify connections between ideas and to analyze those connections. An example is when a teacher lets the student analyze their past test results and the way they got those results. This includes amount of study time and study strategies. Looking at their past study strategies can help them come up with strategies to improve performance. These are some of the ideas important to successful to hugging and bridging practices.&lt;ref name="Harris, S. 2008"/&gt;

There are many benefits of transfer of learning in the classroom. One of the main benefits is the ability to quickly learn a new task. This has many real-life applications such as language and speech processing. Transfer of learning is also very useful in teaching students to use higher cognitive thinking by applying their background knowledge to new situations.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, L., Hanneke, S., &amp; Carbonell, J. A Theory of Transfer Learning with Applications to Active Learning. Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitivism===
{{Main article|Cognitivism (psychology)}}

====Gestalt theory====
[[Cognitive]] theories grew out of [[Gestalt psychology]]. Gestalt psychology was developed in [[Germany]] in the early 1900s by Wolfgang Kohler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soltis|first1=Jonas|title=Perspectives on Learning|date=2004|publisher=Teachers College Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8077-4447-6|page=34|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was brought to [[United States|America]] in the 1920s. The German word ''Gestalt'' is roughly equivalent to the English ''configuration'' or ''organization'' and emphasizes the whole of human experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yount|first=William R.|title=Created to Learn|year=1996|publisher=Broadman &amp; Holman|location=Nashville|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the Gestalt psychologists provided demonstrations and described principles to explain the way we organize our sensations into perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Myers|first=David G.|title=Exploring Psychology|year=2008|publisher=Worth|location=New York, New York|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Wertheimer, one of the founding fathers of Gestalt Theory, observed that sometimes we interpret motion when there is no motion at all.&lt;ref name="Gestalt Psychology"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boeree|first1=George|title=Gestalt Psychology|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/gestalt.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: a powered sign used at a convenience store to indicate that the store is open or closed might be seen as a sign with "flashing lights". However, the lights are not actually flashing. The lights have been programmed to blink rapidly at their own individual pace. Perceived as a whole, the sign flashes. Perceived individually, the lights turn off and on at designated times. Another example of this would be a brick house: As a whole, it is viewed as a standing structure. However, it is actually composed of many smaller parts, which are individual bricks. People tend to see things from a holistic point of view rather than breaking it down into sub units.

In Gestalt theory, psychologists say that instead of obtaining [[knowledge]] from what's in front of us, we often learn by making sense of the relationship between what's new and old.&lt;ref name="Gestalt Psychology"/&gt; Because we have a unique perspective of the world, humans have the ability to generate their own [[learning]] experiences and interpret information that may or may not be the same for someone else.

Gestalt psychologists criticize behaviorists for being too dependent on overt behavior to explain learning. They propose looking at the patterns rather than isolated events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Merriam, Sharan B.]]|title=Learning In Adulthood|year=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gestalt views of learning have been incorporated into what have come to be labeled ''cognitive theories''. Two key assumptions underlie this cognitive approach: that the memory system is an active organized processor of information and that prior knowledge plays an important role in learning. Gestalt theorists believe that for learning to occur, prior knowledge must exist on the topic. When the learner applies their prior knowledge to the advanced topic, the learner can understand the meaning in the advanced topic, and learning can occur Cognitive theories look beyond behavior to consider how human memory works to promote learning, and an understanding of [[short term memory]] and [[long term memory]] is important to educators influenced by cognitive theory. They view learning as an internal mental process (including [[insight]], information processing, memory and [[perception]]) where the educator focuses on building intelligence and cognitive development.&lt;ref name="Smith 1999" /&gt; The individual learner is more important than the environment.

====Other cognitive theories====
Once memory theories like the [[Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkinson|first=R.C. &amp; Shiffrin, R.M.|title=The psychology of learning and motivation|year=1968|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|pages=89–125|edition=2|editor=K.W. Spence and J.T. Spence}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Baddeley's [[working memory]] model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The psychology of learning and motivation: advances in research and theory|year=1974|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|pages=47–89|author=Baddeley, A.D.|edition=8|authorlink=Working memory|author2=Hitch, G.J.L. |editor=G.A. Bower}}&lt;/ref&gt;  were established as a theoretical framework in [[cognitive psychology]], new cognitive frameworks of learning began to emerge during the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. Today, researchers are concentrating on topics like [[cognitive load]] and [[information processing]] theory. These theories of learning play a role in influencing [[instructional design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=deJong|first=T.|title=Cognitive Load Theory, Educational Research, and Instructional Design: Some Food for Thought|journal=Instructional Science: An International Journal of the Learning Sciences|year=2010|page=38|doi=10.1007/s11251-009-9110-0|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive theory is used to explain such topics as social role acquisition, intelligence and memory as related to age.

In the late twentieth century, [[situated cognition]] emerged as a [[theory]] that recognized current learning as primarily the transfer of decontextualized and formal knowledge. Bredo (1994) depicts situated cognition as "shifting the focus from individual in environment to individual and environment".&lt;ref&gt;Bredo, E. (1994). Reconstructing [[educational psychology]]: Situated [[cognition]] and Deweyian pragmatism. Educational Psychologist, 29 (1), 23-35.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, individual [[cognition]] should be considered as intimately related with the context of [[social interaction]]s and culturally constructed meaning. Learning through this perspective, in which known and doing become inseparable, becomes both applicable and whole.

Much of the [[education]] students receive is limited to the culture of schools, without consideration for authentic cultures outside of education. Curricula framed by situated cognition can bring knowledge to life by embedding the learned material within the culture students are familiar with. For example, formal and abstract syntax of math problems can be transformed by placing a traditional math problem within a practical story problem. This presents an opportunity to meet that appropriate balance between situated and transferable knowledge. Lampert (1987) successfully did this by having students explore mathematical concepts that are continuous with their background knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Lampert, M. (1986). Knowing, doing, and teaching multiplication. Cognition and Instruction, 3, 305-342.&lt;/ref&gt; She does so by using money, which all students are familiar with, and then develops the lesson to include more complex stories that allow for students to see various solutions as well as create their own. In this way, knowledge becomes active, evolving as students participate and negotiate their way through new situations.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Brent G., and Karen M. Myers. "Situated Cognition in Theoretical and Practical context." Theoretical Foundations of Learning Environments(1999): n. pag. Situated Cognition. Web. 24 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constructivism ===
{{Main article|Constructivism (learning theory)}}
Founded by [[Jean Piaget]], constructivism emphasizes the importance of the active involvement of learners in constructing knowledge for themselves. Students are thought to use background knowledge and concepts to assist them in their acquisition of novel information. On approaching such new information, the learner faces a loss of equilibrium with their previous understanding, and this demands a change in cognitive structure. This change effectively combines previous and novel information to form an improved cognitive schema. Constructivism can be both subjectively and contextually based. Under the theory of radical constructivism, coined by [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]], understanding relies on one's subjective interpretation of experience as opposed to objective "reality". Similarly, [[William Cobern]]'s idea of contextual constructivism encompasses the effects of culture and society on experience.&lt;ref&gt;Bodner, G., Klobuchar, M., &amp; Geelan, D. (2001). The many forms of constructivism. ''Journal of Chemical Education'', 78, 1107-1134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructivism asks why students do not learn deeply by listening to a teacher, or reading from a textbook. To design effective teaching environments, it believes one needs a good understanding of what children already know when they come into the classroom.  The curriculum should be designed in a way that builds on the pupil's background knowledge and is allowed to develop with them.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M. K. (2002). "Jerome Bruner and the Process of Education."   Retrieved 26 August 2007, fromhttp://www.infed.org/thinkers/bruner.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Begin with complex problems and teach basic skills while solving these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yount|first=William R.|title=Created to Learn|year=1996|publisher=Broadman &amp; Holman|location=Nashville|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learning theories of [[John Dewey]], [[Maria Montessori]], and [[David A. Kolb]] serve as the foundation of the application of constructivist learning theory in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lombardi|first=S.M.|title=Internet Activities for a Preschool Technology Education Program Guided by Caregivers|year=2011|publisher=Doctoral dissertation, North Carolina State University|pages=139–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constructivism (learning theory)|Constructivism]] has many varieties such as [[active learning]], [[discovery learning]], and [[knowledge building]], but all versions promote a student's free exploration within a given framework or structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Devries|first=B.|author2=Zan, B. |title=When children make rules|journal=Educational Leadership|year=2003|volume=61|issue=1|pages=64–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher acts as a facilitator who encourages students to discover principles for themselves and to construct knowledge by working answering open-ended questions and solving real-world problems. To do this, a teacher should encourage curiosity and discussion among his/her students as well as promoting their autonomy. In scientific areas in the classroom, constructivist teachers provide raw data and physical materials for the students to work with and analyze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Books | first = Jacqueline G. | author2=Brooks, Martin G. | title = In search of understanding: The case for constructivist classrooms, revised edition | publisher = The association for supervision and curriculum development | location = Alexandria, VA | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transformative learning theory===
{{Main article|Transformative learning}}
Transformative learning theory seeks to explain how humans revise and reinterpret meaning.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=E.W.|title=Transformative learning theory. New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education|year=2008|publisher=Jossey-Bass|pages=5–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transformative learning is the cognitive process of effecting change in a frame of reference.&lt;ref name="Mezirow 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mezirow|first=J|title=Transformative Learning: Theory to Practice. New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education|year=1997|publisher=Jossey-bass|pages=5–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A frame of reference defines our view of the world. The emotions are often involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ileris|first=K|title=Transformative Learning in the Perspective of a Comprehensive Learning Theory|journal=[[Journal of Transformative Education]]|date=April 2001|issue=2|pages=79–89|doi=10.1177/1541344603262315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults have a tendency to reject any ideas that do not correspond to their particular values, associations and concepts.&lt;ref name="Mezirow 1997" /&gt;

Our frames of reference are composed of two dimensions: habits of mind and points of view.&lt;ref name="Mezirow 1997" /&gt;  Habits of mind, such as [[ethnocentrism]], are harder to change than points of view. Habits of mind influence our point of view and the resulting thoughts or feelings associated with them, but points of view may change over time as a result of influences such as reflection, appropriation and feedback.&lt;ref name="Mezirow 1997" /&gt; Transformative learning takes place by discussing with others the "reasons presented in support of competing interpretations, by critically examining evidence, arguments, and alternative points of view".&lt;ref name="Mezirow 1997" /&gt; When circumstances permit, transformative learners move toward a frame of reference that is more inclusive, discriminating, self-reflective, and integrative of experience.&lt;ref name="Mezirow 1997" /&gt;

==Educational neuroscience==
{{Main article|Educational neuroscience}}
American Universities such as Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and University of Southern California began offering majors and degrees dedicated to [[educational neuroscience]] or [[neuroeducation]] in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Such studies seek to link an understanding of brain processes with classroom instruction and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolf|first=P.|title=Brain Matters: Translating Research into Classroom Practice (2nd ed.)|year=2010|publisher=ASCD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neuroeducation analyzes biological changes in the brain from processing new information. It looks at what environmental, emotional, and social situations best help the brain store and retain new information via the linking of neurons—and best keep the dendrites from being reabsorbed, losing the information. The 1990s were designated "The Decade of the Brain", and advances took place in neuroscience at an especially rapid pace. The three dominant methods for measuring brain activities are [[event-related potential]], [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=ed. by Sawyer|first=R. Keith|title=Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, New York|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The integration and application to education of what we know about the brain was strengthened in 2000 when the [[American Federation of Teachers]] stated: "It is vital that we identify what science tells us about how people learn in order to improve the education curriculum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radin|first=J.P.|title=Brain-Compatible Teaching and Learning: Implications for Teacher Education.|journal=Educ Horiz|date=Fall 2009|volume=88|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is exciting about this new field in education is that modern brain imaging techniques now make it possible, in some sense, to watch the brain as it learns, and the question then arises: can the results of neuro-scientific studies of brains as they are learning usefully inform practice in this area?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowland|title=The brain that changes itself: Stories of personal triumph from the frontiers of brain science|journal=Journal of Academic Language and Learning|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The neuroscience field is young. Researchers expected that new technologies and ways of observing will produce new scientific evidence that helps refine the paradigms of what students need and how they learn best. In particular, it may bring more informed strategies for teaching students with learning disabilities.

===Formal and mental discipline===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
All individuals have the ability to develop mental discipline and the skill of mindfulness, the two go hand in hand. Mental discipline is huge in shaping what people do, say, think and feel. It's critical in terms of the processing of information and involves the ability to recognize and respond appropriately to new things and information people come across, or have recently been taught. Mindfulness is important to the process of learning in many aspects. Being mindful means to be present with and engaged in whatever you are doing at a specific moment in time. Being mindful can aid in helping us to more critically think, feel and understand the new information we are in the process of absorbing.&lt;ref&gt;Sheahly,  [http://www.bemindful.org/mind.htm Cultivating Mental Discipline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407062340/http://www.bemindful.org/mind.htm |date=2015-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The formal discipline approach seeks to develop causation between the advancement of the mind by exercising it through exposure to abstract school subjects such as science, language and mathematics. With student's repetitive exposure to these particular subjects, some scholars feel that the acquisition of knowledge pertaining to science, language and math is of "secondary importance", and believe that the strengthening and further development of the mind that this curriculum provides holds far greater significance to the progressing learner in the long haul.&lt;ref name="Phillips2009" /&gt; D.C. Phillips and Jonas F. Soltis provide some skepticism to this notion. Their skepticism stems largely in part from feeling that the relationship between formal discipline and the overall advancement of the mind is not as strong as some would say. They illustrate their skepticism by opining that it is foolish to blindly assume that people are better off in life, or at performing certain tasks, because of taking particular, yet unrelated courses.

==Multiple intelligences==
{{Main article|Theory of multiple intelligences}}
The existence of multiple intelligences is proposed by psychologist [[Howard Gardner]], who suggests that different kinds of intelligence exists in human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, I. E., J. Seaman, et al. (2007). ''Blending In: The Extent and Promise of Blended Education in the United States''. Needham, M.A., The Sloan Consortium.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a theory that has been fashionable in [[continuous professional development]] (CPD) training courses for teachers. However, the theory of multiple intelligences is often cited as an example of [[pseudoscience]] because it lacks empirical evidence or [[falsifiability]].&lt;ref name="Howard-Jones2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Howard-Jones |first=Paul |title=Introducing Neuroeducational Research: Neuroscience, Education and the Brain from Contexts to Practice |year=2010 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-47200-5 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottfredson2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gottfredson |first=Linda |title=Intelligence: Instant Expert 13 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/data/doc/article/dn19554/instant_expert_13_-_intelligence.pdf |journal=New Scientist |volume=211 |issue=2819  |pages=i-viii (a pullout)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multimedia learning==
[[File:Islington College Multimedia Lab.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Dozens of bright blue computer screens in a large room.|A multimedia classroom at Islington College, in the United Kingdom]]
{{Main article|Multimedia learning}}
Multimedia learning refers to the use of visual and auditory teaching materials that may include video, computer and other [[information technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PSSus6qEHpMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Multimedia Learning|last=Mayer|first=Richard E.|date=2009-01-12|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139475495|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multimedia learning theory focuses on the principles that determine the effective use of multimedia in learning, with emphasis on using both the visual and auditory channels for information processing.

The auditory channel deals with information that is heard, and the visual channel processes information that is seen. The visual channel holds less information than the auditory channel.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} If both the visual and auditory channels are presented with information, more knowledge is retained. However, if too much information is delivered it is inadequately processed, and long term memory is not acquired. Multimedia learning seeks to give instructors the ability to stimulate both the visual and auditory channels of the learner, resulting in better progress.&lt;ref&gt;"Understanding multimedia learning: Integrating multimedia in the k-12 classroom." (n.d.). Retrieved from http://s4.brainpop.com/new_common_images/files/76/76426_BrainPOP_White_Paper-20090426.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Using online games for learning===
{{further information|Educational game|Video games in education}}
Many educators and researchers believe that information technology could bring innovation on traditional educational instructions.&lt;ref name="sitzmann-meta-2011"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Sitzmann | first1 = Traci | title = A Meta-Analytic Examination of the Instructional Effectiveness of Computer-based Simulation Games | date = 27 May 2011 | url = http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/business/about/Faculty-Research/workingPapers/test/Sitzmann_Traci_Simulation%20Games%20Meta-Analysis.pdf | journal = Personnel Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 489–528 | doi = 10.1111/j.1744-6570.2011.01190.x | accessdate = April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers and technologists are searching for new and innovative ways to design learner-centered learning environments effectively, trying to engage learners more in the learning process. Claims have been made that online games have the potential to teach, train and educate and they are effective means for learning skills and attitudes that are not so easy to learn by rote memorization.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Michael | first1 = D.| last2 = Chen | first2 = S.| title = Serious Games: Games that educate, train and transform| date = 2006| url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1051239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a lot of research done in identifying the learning effectiveness in game based learning. Learner characteristics and cognitive learning outcomes have been identified as the key factors in research on the implementation of games in educational settings. In the process of learning a language through an online game, there is a strong relationship between the learner's prior knowledge of that language and their cognitive learning outcomes. For the people with prior knowledge of the language, the learning effectiveness of the games is much more than those with none or less knowledge of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Effects of prior knowledge on cognitive learning outcomes within an English learning multiplayer online role-playing game| url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6630338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other learning theories==
Other learning theories have also been developed for more specific purposes. For example, [[Andragogical learning theory|andragogy]] is the art and science to help adults learn. [[Connectivism (learning theory)|Connectivism]] is a recent theory of [[networked learning]], which focuses on learning as making connections. The Learning as a Network (LaaN) theory builds upon connectivism, complexity theory, and double-loop learning. It starts from the learner and views learning as the continuous creation of a personal knowledge network (PKN).&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Amine Chatti: The LaaN Theory. In: Personalization in Technology Enhanced Learning: A Social Software Perspective. Aachen, Germany: Shaker Verlag, 2010, pp. 19-42. http://mohamedaminechatti.blogspot.de/2013/01/the-laan-theory.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning style theories===
{{Main article|Learning styles}}
Learning style theories propose that individuals learn in different ways, that there are distinct learning styles and that knowledge of a learner's preferred learning style leads to faster and more satisfactory improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M., M. Doyle, et al. (2007). "David a. kolb on experiential learning." Retrieved 24 August 2007, fromhttp://www.infed.org/biblio/b-explrn.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the current research has not been able to find solid scientific evidence to support the main premises of learning styles theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://sxills.nl/lerenlerennu/bronnen/Learning%20styles%20by%20Coffield%20e.a..pdf|title=Learning styles and pedagogy in post-16 learning: a systematic and critical review|last2=Moseley|first2=David|last3=Hall|first3=Elaine|last4=Ecclestone|first4=Kathryn|date=2004|publisher=Learning and Skills Research Centre|year=|isbn=1853389188|location=London|pages=|oclc=505325671|ref=harv|last1=Coffield|first1=Frank|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072804/http://sxills.nl/lerenlerennu/bronnen/Learning%20styles%20by%20Coffield%20e.a..pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informal and post-modern theories===
In theories that make use of [[cognitive restructuring]], an informal curriculum promotes the use of prior knowledge to help students gain a broad understanding of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marzano|first=Robert|title=Fostering thinking across the curriculum through knowledge restructuring|journal=Journal of Reading|year=1991|volume=34|pages=518–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; New knowledge cannot be told to students, it believes, but rather the students' current knowledge must be challenged. In this way, students adjust their ideas to more closely resemble actual theories or concepts.&lt;ref name="Marzano 1991 518–25"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marzano|first=Robert|title=Fostering thinking across the curriculum through knowledge restructuring|journal=Journal of Reading|year=1991|volume=34|pages=518–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By using this method students gain the broad understanding they're taught and later are more willing to learn and keep the specifics of the concept or theory. This theory further aligns with the idea that teaching the concepts and the language of a subject should be split into multiple steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=B|author2=Ryoo, K |title=Teaching Science as a Language: A "Content-First" Approach to Science Teaching|journal=Journal of Research in Science Teaching|year=2008|volume=45|issue=5|pages=529–53|doi=10.1002/tea.20255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other informal learning theories look at the sources of motivation for learning. [[Intrinsic motivation]] may create a more self-regulated learner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deci|first=E.L.|title=Why We Do What We Do: The Dynamics of Personal Autonomy|year=1995|publisher=Putnam's Sons|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet schools undermine intrinsic motivation. Critics argue that the average student learning in isolation performs significantly less well than those learning with collaboration and mediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wells|first=G.|title=Semiotic Mediation, Dialogue and the Construction of Knowledge|journal=Human Development|year=2007|volume=50|issue=5|pages=244–74|doi=10.1159/000106414|citeseerx=10.1.1.506.7763}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students learn through talk, discussion, and argumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wink|first=J.|title=A vision of Vygotsky|year=2002|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vygotsky|first=L|title=Thought and language|year=1986|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Ma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational anthropology==
{{Main article|Philosophy of education}}

===Philosophical anthropology===
{{Main article|Philosophical anthropology}}
According to Theodora Polito, "every well-constructed theory of education [has] at [its] center a philosophical anthropology," which is "a philosophical reflection on some basic problems of mankind."&lt;ref name=Polito2005&gt;Polito, Theodora. (2005). Educational theory as theory of culture: A Vichian perspective on the educational theories of John Dewey and Kieran Egan. Educational Philosophy and Theory, 37(4).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Padilla2013&gt;Padilla, G. J. (2013). Philosophical anthropology: An introduction. In Padilla, G. J. (Ed.), Aporia: Philosophical anthropology: Wittgenstein’s perspective (pp. 7-14). Munchen, DEU: Walter de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophical anthropology is an exploration of human nature and humanity. [[Aristotle]], an early influence on the field, deemed human nature to be "rational animality," wherein humans are closely related to other animals but still set apart by their ability to form rational thought.&lt;ref name=Koterski2013&gt;Koterski, Joseph W. (2013). Anthropology, Philosophical. In New Catholic Encyclopedia Supplement 20122013. (Vol. 1, pp. 7679). Detroit: Gale.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophical anthropology expanded upon these ideas by clarifying that rationality is, "determined by the biological and social conditions in which the lives of human beings are embedded."&lt;ref name=Padilla2013/&gt; Fully developed learning theories address some of the "basic problems of mankind" by examining these biological and social conditions to understand and manipulate the rationality of humanity in the context of learning.&lt;ref name=Padilla2013/&gt;

Philosophical anthropology is evident in [[behaviorism]], which requires an understanding of humanity and human nature in order to assert that the similarities between humans and other animals are critical and influential to the process of learning.&lt;ref name="Phillips2009" /&gt; [[Situated cognition]] focuses on how humans interact with each other and their environments, which would be considered the "social conditions" explored within the field of philosophical anthropology.&lt;ref name="Phillips2009" /&gt; [[Transformative learning]] theories operate with the assumption that humans are rational creatures capable of examining and redefining perspectives, something that is heavily considered within philosophical anthropology.

An awareness and understanding of philosophical anthropology contributes to a greater comprehension and practice of any learning theory. In some cases, philosophy can be used to further explore and define uncertain terms within the field of education.&lt;ref name=Hirst1963&gt;Hirst, Paul H. (Nov. 1963). Philosophy and Educational Theory. British Journal of Educational Studies, 12(1), 51-64. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/3118921&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy can also be a vehicle to explore the purpose of education, which can greatly influence an educational theory.&lt;ref name=Hirst1963/&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of learning theories that seek to displace [[traditional education|traditional educational practices]] claim that there is no need for such theories; that the attempt to comprehend the process of learning through the construction of theories creates problems and inhibits personal freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Holzman, Lois]] (1997).

'''Little Joe''' was an unmanned United States solid-fueled [[booster rocket]] used for eight launches from 1959&amp;ndash;1960 from [[Wallops Island]], Virginia to test the [[launch escape system]] and [[heat shield]] for [[Project Mercury]] capsules, as well as the name given to the test program using the booster. The first rocket designed solely for manned spacecraft qualifications, Little Joe was also one of the pioneer operational launch vehicles using the rocket cluster principle.

The Little Joe name has been attributed to [[Maxime Faget]] at NASA's [[Langley Research Center]] in Hampton, Virginia.  He based the name on four large fins which reminded him of a slang term for a roll of four in [[craps#rolling|craps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Origin of NASA Names|publisher=NASA Science and Technical Information Office|page=10|author1=Helen T. Wells |author2=Susan H. Whiteley |author3=Carrie E. Karegeannes  |last-author-amp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A successor, [[Little Joe II]], was used for flight testing of the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] launch escape system from 1963&amp;ndash;1966.

== Background ==
[[File:Little Joe Air Power Power.JPG|thumb|left|150px|An unflown Little Joe booster (backup for [[LJ-2]]) along with the boilerplate capsule on display at the [[Air Power Park]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Little Joe|url=http://web.mac.com/jimgerard/AFGAS/pages/booster/lj1-arpwr.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070616084411/http://web.mac.com/jimgerard/AFGAS/pages/booster/lj1-arpwr.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-06-16|publisher=A Field Guide to American Spacecraft}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When [[NASA]] needed a booster for the Mercury manned space program, the agency found that the [[Atlas (rocket)|Atlas]] rockets would cost approximately $2.5 million each and that even the [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone]] would cost about [[United States dollar|$]]1 million per launch. The managers of the Mercury program recognized that the numerous early test flights would have to be accomplished by a far less expensive booster system. As it turned out, the Little Joe rocket NASA designed cost about $200,000 each.

In January 1958, [[Max Faget]] and [[Paul Purser]] had worked out in considerable detail on paper how to cluster four of the solid-fuel [[MGM-29 Sergeant|Sergeant rockets]], in standard use at the [[Wallops Flight Facility]] in Virginia, to boost a manned nose cone above the [[stratosphere]]. Faget's short-lived "High Ride" proposal had suffered from comparisons with "Project Adam" at that time, but in August 1958 William Bland and [[Ronald Kolenkiewicz]] had returned to their preliminary designs for a cheap cluster of solid rockets to boost full-scale and full-weight model capsules above the atmosphere. As drop tests of [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] capsules provided new aerodynamic data on the dynamic stability of the configuration in free-fall, the need for comparable data on the powered phase quickly became apparent. So in October 1958, a NASA team prepared new engineering layouts and estimates for the mechanical design of the booster structure and a suitable launcher.

As the blueprints for this cluster of four rockets began to emerge from their drawing boards, the designers' nickname for their project gradually was adopted. Since their first cross-section drawings showed four holes, they called the project "Little Joe," from the [[craps]] throw of a double deuce on the dice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pilarski.casinocitytimes.com/articles/5842.html Pilarski.CasinoCityTimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Although four smaller circles were added later to represent the addition of Recruit rocket motors, the original name stuck. The appearance on engineering drawings of the four large stabilizing fins protruding from its airframe also helped to perpetuate the name Little Joe had acquired.

The primary purpose of this relatively small and simple booster system was to save money&amp;mdash;by allowing numerous test flights to qualify various solutions to the myriad problems associated with the development of manned space flight, especially the problem of escaping from an explosion at or during launch. Capsule aerodynamics under actual reentry conditions was another primary concern. To gain this kind of experience as soon as possible, its designers had to keep the clustered booster simple in concept; it should use solid fuel and existing proven equipment whenever possible, and should be free of any electronic guidance and control systems.

The designers made the Little Joe booster assembly to approximate the same performance that the Army's [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone]] booster would have with the capsule payload. But in addition to being flexible enough to perform a variety of missions, Little Joe could be made for about one-fifth the basic cost of the Redstone, would have much lower operating costs, and could be developed and delivered with much less time and effort. And, unlike the larger launch vehicles, Little Joe could be shot from the existing facilities at Wallops Island.

==Launch vehicle development==

Twelve companies responded during November 1958 to the invitations for bids to construct the airframe of Little Joe. The technical evaluation of these proposals was carried on in much the same manner as for the spacecraft, except that [[Langley Research Center]] itself carried the bulk of the administrative load. The Missile Division of [[North American Aviation]] won the contract on December 29, 1958; and began work immediately in [[Downey, California]], on its order for seven booster airframes and one mobile launcher.

The primary mission objectives for Little Joe as seen in late 1958 (in addition to studying the capsule dynamics at progressively higher altitudes) were to test the capsule escape system at maximum dynamic pressure, to qualify the parachute system, and to verify search and retrieval methods. But since each group of specialists at work on the project sought to acquire firm empirical data as soon as possible, more exact priorities had to be established. The first flights were to secure measurements of inflight and impact forces on the capsule; later flights were to measure critical parameters at the progressively higher altitudes of 20,000, 250,000, and 500,000 feet (6, 75, and 150&amp;nbsp;km). The minimum aims of each Little Joe shot could be supplemented from time to time with studies of noise levels, heat and pressure loads, heat shield separation, and the behavior of animal riders, so long as the measurements could be accomplished with minimum telemetry. Since all the capsules boosted by the Little Joe rockets were expected to be recovered, onboard recording techniques would also contribute to the simplicity of the system.

The first of only two booster systems designed specifically and solely for manned capsule qualifications, Little Joe was also one of the pioneer operational launch vehicles using the rocket cluster principle. Since the four modified Sergeants (called either [[Castor (rocket stage)|Castor]] or Pollux rockets, depending upon modification) and four supplemental Recruit rockets were arranged to fire in various sequences, the takeoff thrust varied greatly, but maximum design thrust was almost 230,000 [[pound-force|pounds]] (1,020 [[kilonewton]]s). Theoretically enough to lift a spacecraft of about 4,000 [[pound (mass)|pounds]] (1,800&amp;nbsp;kg) on a ballistic path over 100 miles (160&amp;nbsp;km) high, the push of these clustered main engines should simulate the takeoff profile in the environment that the manned Atlas would experience. Furthermore, the additional powerful explosive pull of the tractor-rocket escape system could be demonstrated under the most severe takeoff conditions imaginable. The engineers who mothered Little Joe to maturity knew it was not much to look at, but they hoped that their ungainly rocket would prove the legitimacy of most of the ballistic capsule design concepts, thereby earning its own honor.  A successor, [[Little Joe II]], would later be used for flight testing of the Apollo crew escape system.

==Flights==

As of January 21, 1960, the Little Joe series of five actual and attempted flights had expended four of the six test boosters North American had made for NASA and five prototype capsules made in the Langley shops. The primary test objectives for these solid-fuel-boosted models were an integral part of the development flight program conducted within NASA by the Space Task Group, with Langley and Wallops support. Now only two Little Joe boosters remained for the qualification flight tests. North American had manufactured seven Little Joe airframes, but one of these had been retained at the plant in Downey, California, for static loading tests. STG ordered the refurbishment of this seventh airframe so as to have three Little Joe boosters for the qualification flight program. The success of [[Little Joe 1B]] in January 1960 meant that the next flight, the sixth, to be known as [[Little Joe 5]], would be the first to fly a real Mercury capsule from the McDonnell production line. In passing from development flight tests with boilerplate models to qualification flight tests with the "real McDonnell" capsule, the Space Task Group moved further away from research into development and toward operations.

== Mission numbering ==
The official Mercury mission numbering designation was a two letter designation which corresponded to the launch vehicle type, followed by a dash then a digit indicating the particular set of flight objectives, and an optional letter used to distinguish further flights to accomplish those objectives. So the official designation for the first Little Joe flight was "LJ-1."  Flights did not occur in numeric sequence as the project scheduling was adapted as it progressed. The actual flight order was:

==Mission background==

===Previous missions===
In 1973, [[Mariner 10]] was launched by NASA to make multiple flyby encounters of Venus and Mercury. Mariner 10 provided the first detailed data of Mercury, mapping 40–45% of the surface.&lt;ref name="USATMessenger"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2004-08-16-mercury-may-shrink_x.htm |title=MESSENGER to test theory of shrinking Mercury|publisher=USA Today| first=Tariq | last= Malik|date=August 16, 2004 |accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mariner 10's final flyby of Mercury occurred on March 16, 1975. No subsequent close-range observations of the planet would take place for more than 30 years.

===Proposals for the mission===
In 1998, a study detailed a proposed mission to send an orbiting spacecraft to Mercury, as the planet was at that point the least-explored of the inner planets. In the years following the Mariner 10 mission, subsequent mission proposals to revisit Mercury had appeared too costly, requiring large quantities of propellant and a [[heavy lift launch vehicle]]. Moreover, inserting a spacecraft into orbit around Mercury is difficult, because a probe approaching on a direct path from Earth would be accelerated by the [[Sun]]'s gravity and pass Mercury far too quickly to orbit it. However, using a trajectory designed by Chen-wan Yen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finally! NASA Prepares to Orbit Mercury|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/15mar_messenger|website=Science NASA|publisher=NASA|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1985, the study showed it was possible to seek a [[Discovery Program|Discovery-class]] mission by using multiple, consecutive gravity assist, 'swingby' maneuvers around Venus and Mercury, in combination with minor propulsive trajectory corrections, to gradually slow the spacecraft and thereby minimize propellant needs.&lt;ref name="1998Design"&gt;{{Cite journal | first = J.

===Objectives===
The ''MESSENGER'' mission was designed to study the characteristics and environment of Mercury from orbit. Specifically, the scientific objectives of the mission were:&lt;ref name='Objectives1'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=2004-030A | title = MESSENGER – Mission description | accessdate = July 8, 2013 | publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://discovery.nasa.gov/messenger.cfml | title = Discovery Program: MESSENGER | accessdate = July 8, 2013 | publisher = NASA | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130603184332/http://discovery.nasa.gov/messenger.cfml | archivedate = June 3, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* to characterize the chemical composition of Mercury's surface.
* to study the planet's geologic history.
* to elucidate the nature of the global magnetic field ([[magnetosphere]]). 
* to determine the size and state of the [[Planetary core|core]].
* to determine the volatile inventory at the poles.
* to study the nature of Mercury's [[exosphere]].

==Spacecraft design==
[[File:MESSENGER Probe.stl|alt=Interactive 3D model of MESSENGER|thumb|298x298px|Interactive 3D model of ''MESSENGER'']]
The ''MESSENGER'' spacecraft was designed and built at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] [[Applied Physics Laboratory]]. Science operations were managed by [[Sean Solomon]] as principal investigator, and mission operations were also conducted at JHU/APL.&lt;ref name="MESSENGERLaunch"/&gt; The ''MESSENGER'' bus measured {{convert|1.85|m|in|sp=us}} tall, {{convert|1.42|m|in|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|1.27|m|in|abbr=on}} deep. The bus was primarily constructed with four [[graphite fiber]] / [[cyanate ester]] composite panels that supported the propellant tanks, the large velocity adjust (LVA) thruster, attitude monitors and correction thrusters, the antennas, the instrument pallet, and a large ceramic-cloth sunshade, measuring {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, for passive thermal control.&lt;ref name="MESSENGERLaunch"&gt;{{cite press release| publisher=NASA / JHUAPL| date= August 2004| format= PDF| title= MESSENGER NASA's Mission to Mercury Launch Press Kit| url= http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/168019main_MESSENGER_71504_PressKit.pdf| accessdate= February 19, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824103010/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/168019main_MESSENGER_71504_PressKit.pdf|archivedate=August 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At launch, the spacecraft weighed approximately {{convert|1100|kg|lb}} with its full load of propellant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/11147-nasa-mercury-spacecraft-surprising-facts-messenger.html?onswipe_redirect=never|title=10 Surprising Facts About NASA's Mercury Probe|publisher=Space.com|date=March 16, 2011|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''MESSENGER''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s total mission cost, including the cost of the spacecraft's construction, was estimated at under US$450 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url= http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=197 | title= MESSENGER Completes Primary Mission at Mercury, Settles in for Another Year | date= March 19, 2012 | publisher= Johns Hopkins University | accessdate= April 10, 2012 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130513080440/http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=197 | archivedate= May 13, 2013 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attitude control and propulsion===
Main propulsion was provided by the 645&amp;nbsp;[[Newton (unit)|N]], 317 sec.[[Specific impulse|I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[bipropellant rocket|bipropellant]] ([[hydrazine]] and [[nitrogen tetroxide]]) large velocity assist (LVA) thruster. The model used was the [[LEROS|LEROS 1b]], developed and manufactured at AMPAC‐ISP's Westcott works, in the United Kingdom. The spacecraft was designed to carry {{convert|607.8|kg|lb}} of propellant and [[helium]] pressurizer for the LVA.&lt;ref name="MESSENGERLaunch"/&gt;

Four {{convert|22|N|abbr=on}} [[monopropellant rocket|monopropellant]] thrusters provided spacecraft steering during main thruster burns, and twelve {{convert|4.4|N|1|abbr=on}} monopropellant thrusters were used for [[attitude control]]. For precision attitude control, a [[reaction wheel]] [[attitude control system]] was also included.&lt;ref name="MESSENGERLaunch"/&gt; Information for attitude control was provided by [[star tracker]]s, an [[Attitude control (spacecraft)#Gyroscopes|inertial measurement unit]] and six [[sun sensor]]s.&lt;ref name="MESSENGERLaunch"/&gt;

===Communications===

The probe included two [[small deep space transponder]]s for communications with the [[Deep Space Network]] and three kinds of antennas: a high gain phased array whose main beam could be electronically steered in one plane, a medium-gain "fan-beam" antenna and a low gain horn with a broad pattern. The high gain antenna was used as transmit-only at 8.4&amp;nbsp;GHz, the medium-gain and low gain antennas transmit at 8.4&amp;nbsp;GHz and receive at 7.2&amp;nbsp;GHz, and all three antennas operate with right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) radiation. One of each of these antennas was mounted on the front of the probe facing the Sun, and one of each was mounted to the back of the probe facing away from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mwjournal.com/Journal/article.asp?HH_ID=AR_110 |title=The Medium-gain Antenna of the MESSENGER Spacecraft |publisher=Microwave Journal |date=October 1, 2005 |accessdate=March 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101111825/http://www.mwjournal.com/Journal/article.asp?HH_ID=AR_110 |archivedate=November 1, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power===

The space probe was powered by a two-panel [[gallium arsenide]]/[[germanium]] [[solar array]] providing an average of 450 [[watt]]s while in Mercury orbit. Each panel was rotatable and included optical solar reflectors to balance the temperature of the array. Power was stored in a common-pressure-vessel, 23-[[ampere]]-hour [[nickel–hydrogen battery]], with 11 vessels and two cells per vessel.&lt;ref name="MESSENGERLaunch"/&gt;

===Computer and software===

The spacecraft's onboard computer system was contained in an Integrated Electronics Module (IEM), a device that combined core [[avionics]] into a single box. The computer featured two [[Radiation hardening|radiation-hardened]] [[IBM RAD6000]]s, a 25&amp;nbsp;[[megahertz]] main processor, and a 10&amp;nbsp;MHz fault protection processor. For redundancy, the spacecraft carried a pair of identical IEMs. For [[Data storage device|data storage]], the spacecraft carried two [[Solid-state drive|solid-state]] recorders able to store up to one [[gigabyte]] each. The IBM RAD6000 main processor collected, [[Data compression|compressed]], and stored data from ''MESSENGER''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s instruments for later playback to Earth.&lt;ref name="MESSENGERLaunch"/&gt;

''MESSENGER'' used a software suite called SciBox to simulate its orbit and instruments, in order to "choreograph the complicated process of maximizing the scientific return from the mission and minimizing conflicts between instrument observations, while at the same time meeting all spacecraft constraints on pointing, data downlink rates, and onboard data storage capacity."&lt;ref name="jhuapl"/&gt;

===Launch and trajectory===
The ''MESSENGER'' probe was launched on August 3, 2004 at 06:15:56 UTC by [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Space Launch Complex 17B]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] in Florida, aboard a [[Delta II|Delta II 7925]] launch vehicle. The complete burn sequence lasted 57 minutes bringing the spacecraft into a heliocentric orbit, with a final velocity of 10.68&amp;nbsp;km/s (6.64&amp;nbsp;miles/s) and sending the probe into a 7.9 billion-kilometer trajectory that took 6 years, 7 months and 16 days before its orbital insertion on March 18, 2011.&lt;ref name="MESSENGERLaunch"/&gt;

Traveling to Mercury requires an extremely large velocity change (''see [[delta-v]]'') because Mercury's orbit is deep in the Sun's [[gravity well]].  On a direct course from Earth to Mercury, a spacecraft is constantly accelerated as it falls toward the Sun, and will arrive at Mercury with a velocity too high to achieve orbit without excessive use of fuel. For planets with an atmosphere, such as [[Venus]] and [[Mars]], spacecraft can minimize their fuel consumption upon arrival by using friction with the atmosphere to enter orbit ([[aerocapture]]), or can briefly fire their rocket engines to enter into orbit followed by a reduction of the orbit by [[aerobraking]]. However, the tenuous [[atmosphere of Mercury]] is far too thin for these maneuvers.  Instead, ''MESSENGER'' extensively used [[gravity assist]] maneuvers at Earth, Venus, and Mercury to reduce the speed relative to Mercury, then used its large rocket engine to enter into an elliptical orbit around the planet.  The multi-flyby process greatly reduced the amount of propellant necessary to slow the spacecraft, but at the cost of prolonging the trip by many years and to a total distance of 4.9 billion miles.

Several planned thruster firings en route to Mercury were unnecessary, because these fine course adjustments were performed using solar radiation pressure acting on MESSENGER's solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=102 |title=MESSENGER Sails on Sun's Fire for Second Flyby of Mercury |date=2008-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514095117/http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=102 |archivedate=2013-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To further minimize the amount of necessary propellant, the spacecraft orbital insertion targeted a highly [[elliptical orbit]] around Mercury.

The elongated orbit had two other benefits:  It allowed the spacecraft time to cool after the times it was between the hot surface of Mercury and the Sun, and also it allowed the spacecraft to measure the effects of [[solar wind]] and the magnetic fields of the planet at various distances while still allowing close-up measurements and photographs of the surface and exosphere.
&lt;!--
The spacecraft was originally scheduled to launch during a 12-day window that beginning May 11, 2004. On March 26, 2004, NASA announced the launch would be moved to a later, 15-day launch window beginning July 30, 2004, to allow for further testing of the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title= MESSENGER Launch Rescheduled. | publisher=Johns Hopkins University| date=2004-03-24 | url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/2004/status_report_03_24_04.html | accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change significantly altered the trajectory of the mission and delayed the arrival at Mercury by two years. The original plan called for three fly-by maneuvers past Venus, with Mercury orbit insertion scheduled for 2009. The trajectory was changed to include one Earth flyby, two Venus flybys, and three Mercury flybys before [[orbit insertion]] on March 18, 2011.{{Citation needed}}

===Earth flyby===
{{main|Earth observation satellite}}
''MESSENGER'' performed an Earth [[Gravity assist|flyby]] one year after launch, on August 2, 2005, with the closest approach at 19:13 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] at an altitude of 2,347 kilometers (1,458 statute miles) over central [[Mongolia]]. On December 12, 2005, a 524-second-long burn (Deep-Space Maneuver or DSM-1) of the large thruster adjusted the trajectory for the upcoming Venus flyby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | date=December 12, 2005 | url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=18956 | title=MESSENGER Engine Burn Puts Spacecraft on Track for Venus | publisher=Johns Hopkins University | accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Earth flyby, the ''MESSENGER'' team imaged the Earth and Moon using MDIS and checked the status of several other instruments observing the atmospheric and surface compositions and testing the magnetosphere and determining that all instruments tested were working as expected. This calibration period was intended to ensure accurate interpretation of data when the spacecraft entered orbit around Mercury. Ensuring that the instruments functioned correctly at such an early stage in the mission allowed opportunity for multiple minor errors to be dealt with.&lt;ref name="MGREarthFlyby"&gt;{{cite press release| publisher=NASA/APL| date=August 26, 2005| title=MESSENGER Status Report| url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/2005/status_report_08_26_05.html| accessdate=March 17, 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513081510/http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/2005/status_report_08_26_05.html| archivedate=May 13, 2013| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth flyby was used to investigate the [[flyby anomaly]], where some spacecraft have been observed to have trajectories that differ slightly from those predicted.  However no anomaly was observed in MESSENGER's flyby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anderson, J. D., Campbell, J. K., Ekelund, J. E., Ellis, J., &amp; Jordan, J.

===Two Venus flybys===
{{main|Exploration of Venus}}
On October 24, 2006 at 08:34 UTC, ''MESSENGER'' encountered Venus at an altitude of {{convert|2992|km|mi|sp=us}}. During the encounter, ''MESSENGER'' passed behind Venus and entered [[superior conjunction]], a period when Earth was on the exact opposite side of the Solar System, with the Sun inhibiting radio contact. For this reason, no scientific observations were conducted during the flyby. Communication with the spacecraft was reestablished in late November and performed a deep space maneuver on December 12, to correct the trajectory to encounter Venus in a second flyby.&lt;ref name="MGRVenusFlyby1"&gt;{{cite press release| publisher=NASA/APL| date=October 24, 2006| title=MESSENGER Completes Venus Flyby| url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/2006/status_report_10_24_06.html| accessdate=2011-03-17| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513080436/http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/2006/status_report_10_24_06.html| archivedate=May 13, 2013| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2007, at 23:08 UTC, ''MESSENGER'' performed a second flyby of Venus at an altitude of {{convert|338|km|mi|abbr=on}}, for the greatest velocity reduction of the mission. During the encounter, all instruments were used to observe Venus and prepare for the following Mercury encounters. The encounter provided visible and [[infrared|near-infrared]] imaging data of the upper [[atmosphere of Venus]]. [[Ultraviolet]] and X-ray [[Spectrometer|spectrometry]] of the upper atmosphere were also recorded, to characterize the composition. The [[ESA]]'s [[Venus Express]] was also orbiting during the encounter, providing the first opportunity for simultaneous measurement of particle-and-field characteristics of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Critical Deep-Space Maneuver Targets MESSENGER for Its First Mercury Encounter | publisher=Johns Hopkins University | date=October 17, 2007 | url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/2007/status_report_10_17_07.html | accessdate=2009-05-01 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201211816/http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/2007/status_report_10_17_07.html | archivedate=December 1, 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three Mercury flybys===
{{main|Exploration of Mercury}}
''MESSENGER'' made a flyby of Mercury on January 14, 2008 (making its closest approach of 200&amp;nbsp;km above the surface of Mercury at 19:04:39 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), followed by a second flyby on October 6, 2008.&lt;ref name="jhuapl1"/&gt; ''MESSENGER'' executed a final flyby on September 29, 2009, further slowing down the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="jhuapl2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jhuapl3"/&gt; Sometime during the closest approach of the last flyby, the spacecraft entered [[Safe mode (spacecraft)|safe mode]]. Although this had no effect on the trajectory necessary for later orbit insertion, it resulted in the loss of science data and images that were planned for the outbound leg of the fly-by. The spacecraft had fully recovered by about seven hours later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MESSENGER Gains Critical Gravity Assist for Mercury Orbital Observations |url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=136 |date=September 30, 2009 |publisher=MESSENGER Mission News |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510175510/http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=136 |archivedate=May 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One last deep space maneuver, DSM-5, was executed on November 24, 2009, at 22:45 UTC to provide the required velocity change for the scheduled Mercury orbit insertion on March 18, 2011, marking the beginning of the orbital mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url= http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=140 | title= Deep-Space Maneuver Positions MESSENGER for Mercury Orbit Insertion | date= November 24, 2009 | publisher= Johns Hopkins University | accessdate= April 20, 2010 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130513075449/http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=140 | archivedate= May 13, 2013 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbital insertion===
The thruster maneuver to insert the probe into Mercury's orbit began at 00:45&amp;nbsp;UTC on March 18, 2011. The maneuver lasted about 15 minutes, with confirmation that the craft was in Mercury orbit received at 01:10&amp;nbsp;UTC on March 18 (9:10 PM, March 17 EDT).&lt;ref name="MGROrbitInsert"&gt;{{cite press release| publisher=NASA/APL| date=March 17, 2011| title=MESSENGER Begins Historic Orbit around Mercury| url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=161| accessdate=March 18, 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412074403/http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=161| archivedate=April 12, 2013| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mission lead engineer Eric Finnegan indicated that the spacecraft had achieved a near-perfect orbit.&lt;ref name=BSun&gt;{{cite news| last=Roylance| first=Frank| title=Messenger successfully goes into orbit around Mercury| url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-messenger-orbit-20110317,0,3774709.story| accessdate=March 18, 2011| newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]| date=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''MESSENGER'''s orbit was highly elliptical, taking it within {{convert|200|km|miles|sp=us}} of Mercury's surface and then {{convert|15000|km|miles|abbr=on}} away from it every twelve hours. This orbit was chosen to shield the probe from the heat radiated by Mercury's hot surface.

==Primary science==
After ''MESSENGER'''s orbital insertion, an eighteen-day commissioning phase took place. The supervising personnel switched on and tested the craft's science instruments to ensure they had completed the journey without damage.&lt;ref name="OrbitInsertionPressKit"&gt;{{cite press release| publisher=NASA/APL| date=March 18, 2011| title=MESSENGER Mercury Orbit Insertion| url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/Mercury_PK_TST_Rev7_Web.pdf| accessdate=March 17, 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513075203/http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/Mercury_PK_TST_Rev7_Web.pdf| archivedate=May 13, 2013| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commissioning phase "demonstrated that the spacecraft and payload [were] all operating nominally, notwithstanding Mercury's challenging environment."&lt;ref name="jhuapl"/&gt;

===Solar System portrait===
{{main|Family Portrait (MESSENGER)}}
On February 18, 2011, a portrait of the Solar System was published on the ''MESSENGER'' website.  The mosaic contained 34 images, acquired by the MDIS instrument during November 2010.  All the planets were visible with the exception of [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], due to their vast distances from the Sun. The ''MESSENGER'' "family portrait" was intended to be complementary to the [[Family Portrait (Voyager)|Voyager family portrait]], which was acquired from the outer Solar System by [[Voyager 1]] on February 14, 1990.&lt;ref name="APLPortrait"&gt;{{cite press release| publisher=APL| date=February 18, 2011| title=A Solar System Family Portrait, from the Inside Out| url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=155| accessdate=February 18, 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512035442/http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=155| archivedate=May 12, 2013| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of mission==
After running out of [[propellant]] for course adjustments, ''MESSENGER'' entered its expected terminal phase of orbital decay in late 2014. The spacecraft's operation was extended by several weeks by exploiting its remaining supply of helium gas, which was used to pressurize its propellant tanks, as [[reaction mass]].&lt;ref name=Pressurant2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2014/12/innovative-use-of-pressurant-extends-messengers-mercury-mission|title=Innovative use of pressurant extends MESSENGER's Mercury mission|publisher=Astronomy.com|date=December 29, 2014|accessdate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''MESSENGER'' continued studying Mercury during its decay period.&lt;ref name="Wu 2015"/&gt; The spacecraft crashed onto the surface of Mercury on April 30, 2015, at 3:26&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:26 GMT), at a velocity of {{convert|14080|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, probably creating a crater in the planet's surface approximately {{convert|16|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref name='Bang'/&gt;&lt;ref name="space.com.end"/&gt; The spacecraft was estimated to have impacted at 54.4° N, 149.9° W on [[Suisei Planitia]], near the crater [[Janáček (crater)|Janáček]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/120043/mercury-messenger-mission-concludes-with-a-smashing-finale/ |title=Mercury Messenger Mission Ends with a Smashing Finale|publisher=Universe Today|date=April 30, 2015|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crash occurred on the side of the planet not visible from Earth, and thus was not detected by any observers or instruments.

[[File:Love machine.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Love tester machine|Love Meter]] and [[Strength tester machine]] at a [[Framingham, Massachusetts]] rest stop.]]

A '''measuring instrument''' is a device for measuring a [[physical quantity]]. In the [[physical science]]s, [[quality assurance]], and [[engineering]], [[measurement]] is the activity of obtaining and comparing [[Physical quantity|physical quantities]] of real-world [[object (philosophy)|objects]] and [[phenomenon|events]].  Established standard objects and events are used as [[Units of measurement|units]], and the process of  measurement gives a number relating the item under study and the referenced unit of measurement. Measuring instruments, and formal [[test method]]s which define the instrument's use, are the means by which these relations of numbers are obtained.  All measuring instruments are subject to varying degrees of [[instrument error]] and [[measurement uncertainty]].

[[Scientist]]s, [[engineer]]s and other humans use a vast range of instruments to perform their measurements. These instruments may range from simple objects such as [[ruler]]s and [[stopwatch]]es to [[electron microscope]]s and [[particle accelerator]]s. [[Virtual instrumentation]] is widely used in the development of modern measuring instruments.

==Time==
[[File:MontreGousset001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Watch]], a time measurement device]]
{{main|Time}}
In the past, a common time measuring instrument was the [[sundial]]. Today, the  usual measuring instruments for time are [[clock]]s and [[watch]]es. For highly accurate measurement of time an [[atomic clock]] is used.
Stop watches are also used to measure time in some sports.
{{clear}}

==Energy==
{{main|Energy}}

Energy is measured by an energy meter. Examples of energy meters include:

===Electricity meter===
An [[electricity meter]] measures energy directly in [[kilowatt hour]]s.

===Gas meter===
A [[gas meter]] measures energy indirectly by recording the volume of gas used. This figure can then be converted to a measure of energy by multiplying it by the [[calorific value]] of the gas.

==Power (flux of energy)==

{{main|Power (physics)}}
A [[physical system]] that exchanges energy may be described by the amount of energy exchanged per time-[[interval (time)|interval]], also called power or [[flux]] of energy.
*(see any measurement device for power below)

==Action==

{{main|Action (physics)}}
Action describes energy summed up over the time a process lasts (time [[integral]] over energy). Its [[Dimension#Dimensionful quantities|dimension]] is the same as that of an [[angular momentum]].

==Electricity, electronics and electrical engineering==
{{See also|Electrical measurements}}
Considerations related to [[electric charge]] dominate [[electricity]] and [[electronics]].
Electrical charges interact via a [[Electromagnetic field|field]]. That field is called [[electric field|electric]] if the charge doesn't move. If the charge moves, thus realizing an electric current, especially in an electrically neutral conductor, that field is called [[magnetic field|magnetic]].
Electricity can be given a quality — a [[Electric potential|potential]].  And electricity has a substance-like property, the electric charge.
Energy (or power) in elementary electrodynamics is calculated by multiplying the potential by the amount of charge (or current) found at that potential:  potential times charge (or current). (See [[Classical electromagnetism]] and its [[Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism]])
[[File:Electroscope.png|thumb|right|An instrument for detecting net charges, the [[electroscope]].]]

===Electric charge===
*[[Electrometer]] is  often used to reconfirm the phenomenon of [[Contact electrification|contact electricity]] leading to [[triboelectric effect|triboelectric sequences]].
*[[Torsion balance]] used by [[Charles Augustin de Coulomb|Coulomb]] to establish a relation between charges and force, see [[Measuring instrument#Force (current of linear momentum)|above]].

For the ranges of charge values see: [[Orders of magnitude (charge)]]

===Electric current (current of charge)===


*[[Ammeter]]
*[[Clamp meter]]
*[[Galvanometer]]
*[[D'Arsonval galvanometer]]

===[[Voltage]] ([[electric potential]] difference)===
*[[Oscilloscope]] allows quantifying time-dependent voltages
*[[Voltmeter]]

===[[Electric resistance]], [[electrical conductance]] (and [[electrical conductivity]])===
*[[Ohmmeter]]
*[[Time-domain reflectometer]] characterizes and locates faults in metallic cables by [[runtime measurement]]s of electric signals.
*[[Wheatstone bridge]]

===[[Electric capacitance]]===
*[[Capacitance meter]]

===[[Electric inductance]]===
*[[Inductance meter]]

===Energy carried by electricity or electric energy===
*[[Electric energy meter]]
*[[Electricity meter]]

===[[Power (physics)|Power]] carried by electricity ([[Electric current|current]] of energy)===
*[[Wattmeter]]

===[[Electric field]] (negative [[gradient]] of electric potential, voltage per length)===
*[[Field mill]]

===[[Magnetic field]]===
See also the relevant section in the article about the [[Magnetic field#Measuring the magnetic B field|magnetic field]].
*[[Compass]]
*[[Hall effect sensor]]
*[[Magnetometer]]
*[[Proton magnetometer]]
*[[SQUID]]

For the ranges of magnetic field see: [[Orders of magnitude (magnetic field)]]

===Combination instruments===
*[[Multimeter]], combines the functions of ammeter, voltmeter and ohmmeter as a minimum.
*[[LCR meter]], combines the functions of ohmmeter, capacitance meter and inductance meter.  Also called ''component bridge'' due to the [[bridge circuit]] method of measurement.

==[[Thermodynamics]]==
[[Temperature]]-related considerations dominate thermodynamics. There are two distinct thermal properties: A [[thermal potential]] — the temperature. For example: A glowing coal has a different thermal quality than a non-glowing one.

And a substance-like property, — the [[entropy]]; for example: One glowing coal won't heat a pot of water, but a hundred will.

Energy in thermodynamics is calculated by multipying the thermal potential by the amount of entropy found at that potential:  temperature times entropy.

Entropy can be created by friction but not annihilated.

===[[Amount of substance]] (or [[Mole (unit)|mole number]])===
:A physical quantity introduced in [[chemistry]]; usually determined indirectly.  If mass and substance type of the sample are known, then [[Atomic mass|atomic]]- or [[molecular mass]]es (taken from a [[periodic table]], masses measured by [[mass spectrometry]]) give direct access to the value of the amount of substance. See also the article about [[molar mass]]es.  If specific molar values are given, then the amount of substance of a given sample may be determined by measuring volume, mass or concentration. See also the subsection below about the measurement of the boiling point.
*[[Gas collecting tube]] gases

===[[Temperature]]===
*[[Electromagnetic spectroscopy]]
*[[Galileo thermometer]]
*[[Gas thermometer]] principle: relation between temperature and volume or pressure of a gas ([[Gas laws]]).
**[[constant pressure gas thermometer]]
**[[constant volume gas thermometer]]
*[[Liquid crystal thermometer]]
*[[liquid thermometer]] principle: relation between temperature and volume of a liquid ([[Coefficient of thermal expansion]]).
**[[Alcohol thermometer]]
**[[Mercury-in-glass thermometer]]
*[[Pyranometer]] principle: solar radiation flux density relates to surface temperature ([[Stefan–Boltzmann law]]) &lt;!-- could be no entirely right --&gt;
*[[Pyrometer]]s principle:  temperature dependence of spectral intensity of light ([[Planck's law]]), i.e. the color of the light relates to the temperature of its source, &lt;!-- could be no entirely right --&gt;range: from about −50&amp;nbsp;°C to +4000&amp;nbsp;°C, note: measurement of [[radiation|thermal radiation]] (instead of [[Heat conduction|thermal conduction]], or [[convection|thermal convection]]) means: no physical contact becomes necessary in temperature measurement ([[pyrometry]]). Also note: thermal space resolution (images) found in [[Thermography]].
*[[Resistance thermometer]] principle: relation between temperature and electrical resistance of metals (platinum) ([[Electrical resistance]]), range: 10 to 1,000 kelvins, application in physics and industry
*[[solid thermometer]] principle: relation between temperature and length of a solid ([[Coefficient of thermal expansion]]).
**[[Bi-metallic strip]]
*[[Thermistor]]s principle: relation between temperature and electrical resistance of ceramics or polymers, range: from about 0.01 to 2,000 kelvins (−273.14 to 1,700&amp;nbsp;°C)
*[[Thermocouple]]s principle: relation between temperature and voltage of metal junctions ([[Seebeck effect]]), range: from about −200&amp;nbsp;°C to +1350&amp;nbsp;°C
*[[Thermometer]]
*[[Thermopile]] is a set of connected [[thermocouple]]s
*[[Triple Point|Triple Point cell]] used for calibrating thermometers.

====Imaging technology====
*[[Thermography|Thermographic camera]] uses a [[microbolometer]] for detection of heat-radiation.

See also [[Temperature measurement]] and [[:Category:Thermometers]]. More technically related may be seen  [[thermal analysis]] methods in [[materials science]].

For the ranges of temperature-values see: [[Orders of magnitude (temperature)]]

===[[Energy]] carried by [[entropy]] or [[thermal energy]]===
[[File:Joule apparatus.png|thumb|right|An active [[calorimeter]] lacking a temperature measurement device.]]

This includes [[thermal capacitance]] or temperature coefficient of energy, [[reaction energy]], [[heat flow]] ...
Calorimeters are called passive if gauged to measure emerging energy carried by entropy, for example from chemical reactions. Calorimeters are called active or heated if they heat the sample, or reformulated: if they are gauged to fill the sample with a defined amount of entropy.
*[[Actinometer]] measures the heating power of radiation.
*[[constant-temperature calorimeter]], phase change calorimeter for example an [[ice calorimeter]] or any other calorimeter observing a phase change or using a gauged phase change for heat measurement.
*[[constant-volume calorimeter]], also called bomb calorimeter
*[[constant-pressure calorimeter]], enthalpy-meter or coffee cup calorimeter
*[[Differential scanning calorimetry|Differential Scanning Calorimeter]]
*[[Reaction calorimeter]]

: see also [[Calorimeter]] or [[Calorimetry]]

===Entropy===
[[Entropy]] is accessible indirectly by measurement of energy and temperature.

====Entropy transfer====
Phase change calorimeter's energy value divided by absolute temperature give the entropy exchanged. Phase changes produce no entropy and therefore offer themselves as an entropy measurement concept. Thus entropy values occur indirectly by processing energy measurements at defined temperatures, without producing entropy.
*[[constant-temperature calorimeter]], phase change calorimeter
*[[Heat flux sensor]] uses [[thermopile]]s which are connected [[thermocouple]]s to determine [[current density]] or [[flux]] of entropy.

====Entropy content====
The given sample is cooled down to  (almost) absolute zero (for example by submerging the sample in liquid helium). At absolute zero temperature any sample is assumed to contain no entropy (see [[Third law of thermodynamics]] for further information). Then the following two active calorimeter types can be used to fill the sample with entropy until the desired temperature has been reached: (see also [[Thermodynamic databases for pure substances]])
*[[constant-pressure calorimeter]], enthalpy-meter, active
*[[constant-temperature calorimeter]], phase change calorimeter, active

====Entropy production====
Processes transferring energy from a non-thermal carrier to heat as a carrier do produce entropy (Example: mechanical/electrical friction, established by [[Benjamin Thompson|Count Rumford]]).
Either the produced entropy or heat are measured (calorimetry) or the transferred energy of the non-thermal carrier may be measured.
*calorimeter
*(any device for measuring the work which will or would eventually be converted to heat and the ambient temperature)
Entropy lowering its temperature—without losing energy—produces entropy (Example: Heat conduction in an isolated rod; "thermal friction").
*calorimeter

===[[temperature coefficient of energy]] or "[[heat capacity]]"===
Concerning a given sample, a proportionality factor relating temperature change and energy carried by heat. If the sample is a gas, then this coefficient depends significantly on being measured at constant volume or at constant pressure. (The terminiology preference in the heading indicates that the classical use of heat bars it from having substance-like properties.)
*[[constant-volume calorimeter]], bomb calorimeter
*[[constant-pressure calorimeter]], enthalpy-meter

===specific [[temperature coefficient of energy]] or "[[specific heat]]"===
The temperature coefficient of energy divided by a substance-like quantity ([[amount of substance]], [[mass]], [[volume]]) describing the sample. Usually calculated from measurements by a division or could be measured directly using a unit amount of that sample.

===[[Substance potential]] or [[chemical potential]] or molar [[Gibbs energy]]===
[[Phase (matter)|Phase]] conversions like changes of [[State of matter|aggregate state]], [[chemical reaction]]s or [[nuclear reaction]]s transmuting substances, from [[reactant]]s to [[Product (chemistry)|products]], or [[diffusion]] through [[Membrane (selective barrier)|membranes]] have an overall energy balance. Especially at constant pressure and constant temperature molar energy balances define the notion of a [[substance potential]] or [[chemical potential]] or molar [[Gibbs energy]], which gives the energetic information about whether the process is possible or not - in a [[closed system]].

Energy balances that include entropy consist of two parts: A balance that accounts for the changed entropy content of the substances. And another one that accounts for the energy freed or taken by that reaction itself, the [[Gibbs energy]] change.  The sum of reaction energy and energy associated to the change of entropy content is also called [[enthalpy]]. Often the whole enthalpy is carried by entropy and thus measurable calorimetrically.

For standard conditions in chemical reactions either molar entropy content and molar Gibbs energy with respect to some chosen zero point are tabulated. Or molar entropy content and molar enthalpy with respect to some chosen zero are tabulated. (See [[Standard enthalpy change of formation]] and [[Standard molar entropy]])

The substance potential of a [[redox]] [[chemical reaction|reaction]] is usually determined [[Electrochemistry|electrochemically]] current-free using [[reversible cell]]s.

Other values may be determined indirectly by calorimetry. Also by analyzing phase-diagrams.

==Military==
Some instruments, such as telescopes and sea navigation instruments, have had military applications for many centuries. However, the role of instruments in military affairs rose exponentially with the development of technology via applied science, which began in the mid-19th century and has continued through the present day. Military instruments as a class draw on most of the categories of instrument described throughout this article, such as [[#Navigation|navigation]], [[#Astronomy|astronomy]], optics and imaging, and the kinetics of moving objects. Common abstract themes that unite military instruments are seeing into the distance, seeing in the dark, knowing an object's geographic location, and knowing and controlling a moving object's path and destination. Special features of these instruments may include [[ease of use]], [[speed]], [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[accuracy]].

'''Mercury-Redstone 4''' was the second [[United States]] [[human spaceflight]], on July 21, 1961. The [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|suborbital]] [[Project Mercury]] flight was launched with a [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle]], MRLV-8. The spacecraft, Mercury [[space capsule|capsule]] #11, was nicknamed the '''''Liberty Bell 7''''', and it was piloted by the [[astronaut]] [[Gus Grissom|Virgil "Gus" Grissom]].

The spaceflight lasted 15 minutes 30 seconds, it reached an altitude of more than {{convert|102.8|nmi|km|sp=us}}, and it flew {{convert|262.5|nmi|km|sp=us}} downrange, landing in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The flight went as expected until just after splashdown, when the hatch cover, designed to release explosively in the event of an emergency, accidentally blew. Grissom was at risk of drowning, but he was recovered safely via a [[U.S. Navy]] [[helicopter]]. The spacecraft sank into the Atlantic, and it was not recovered until 1999.

==Spacecraft==
The ''Liberty Bell 7'' spacecraft, Mercury spacecraft #11, was designated to fly the second manned suborbital flight in October 1960. It came off McDonnell's St. Louis production line in May 1960. ''Liberty Bell 7'' was the first Mercury operational spacecraft with a centerline window instead of two portholes. It was closer to the final orbital version than was Alan Shepard's ''[[Freedom 7]]''. Dubbed ''Liberty Bell 7'', it featured a white, diagonal, irregular paint stripe starting at the base of the capsule and extending about two-thirds toward the nose, emulating the crack in the famed [[Liberty Bell]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

===Explosive hatch===
[[Image:Mercury 4 Hatch.png|thumb|upright|left|MR-4 Explosive Hatch Diagram. (NASA)]]

''Liberty Bell 7'' also had a new explosive hatch release. This would allow an astronaut to exit the spacecraft quickly in the event of an emergency. Emergency personnel could also trigger the explosive hatch from outside the spacecraft by pulling on an external lanyard. Both the pop-off hatch and the lanyard are standard features of [[ejection seats]] used in military aircraft, but in the Mercury design, the pilot still had to exit the craft himself, or be removed by emergency personnel. The original exit procedure was to climb out through the antenna compartment, after removing a small pressure bulkhead. This was a difficult and slow procedure. Removal of an injured or unconscious astronaut through the top hatch would be nearly impossible. The original side hatch was bolted shut with 70 bolts and covered with several spacecraft shingles, making it a slow process to open the original hatch.

[[McDonnell Aircraft]] engineers devised two different quick release hatches for the Mercury spacecraft. The first had a latch, and was used on Ham's (a [[chimpanzee]]) MR-2 and Shepard's MR-3 missions. The second design was an explosive release hatch. The quick release latching hatch weighed 69&amp;nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (31&amp;nbsp;[[Kilogram|kg]]), too much of a weight addition to use on the orbital version of the spacecraft. The explosive hatch design used the 70 bolts of the original design, but each quarter-inch (6.35&amp;nbsp;mm) titanium bolt had a {{convert|0.06|in|mm|abbr=on}} hole bored into it to provide a weak point. A mild detonating fuse (MDF) was installed in a channel between the inner and outer seal around the periphery of the hatch. When the MDF was ignited, the resulting gas pressure between the inner and outer seal would cause the bolts to fail in tension.

There were two ways to fire the explosive hatch during recovery. On the inside of the hatch was a knobbed plunger. The pilot could remove a pin and press the plunger with a force of 5 or 6&amp;nbsp;[[pound-force|lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;]] (25&amp;nbsp;[[Newton (units)|N]]). This would detonate the explosive charge, which would shear off the 70 bolts and propel the hatch {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} away in one second. If the pin was left in place, a force of 40&amp;nbsp;lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; (180&amp;nbsp;N) was required to detonate the bolts. An outside rescuer could blow open the hatch by removing a small panel near the hatch and pulling a lanyard. The explosive hatch weighed {{convert|23|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.

===Window===
The new trapezoidal window on ''Liberty Bell 7'' replaced the two {{convert|10|in|mm|abbr=on}} side portholes that were on Freedom 7. The [[Corning Glass Works]] of [[Corning, New York]], designed and developed the multilayered panes that comprised the new window. The outer pane was {{convert|0.35|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick [[Vycor]] glass. It could withstand temperatures of {{convert|1500|to|1800|F|C}}. The inner pane was made of three inner glass panels bonded to form a single inner pane. One panel was a {{convert|0.17|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick sheet of Vycor, while the others were tempered glass. This new window assembly was as strong as any part of the spacecraft pressure vessel.

===Controls===
The manual controls of ''Liberty Bell 7'' incorporated a new rate stabilization control system. This allowed fine [[attitude control|control of spacecraft attitude]] movements by small turns of the hand controller. Previously a lot of jockeying of the device was needed to maintain the desired attitude. This rate damping, or rate augmentation system, gave finer and easier handling qualities and a redundant means of firing the pitch, yaw, and roll thrusters.

Before the Mercury-Redstone 4 mission, [[Lewis Research Center]] and [[Space Task Group]] engineers had determined that firing the posigrade rockets into the booster-spacecraft adapter, rather than in the open, developed 78 percent greater thrust. This achieved a greater spacecraft-booster separation through a kind of "pop-gun" effect. By using this technique, the spacecraft separated at velocity of about {{convert|28.1|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} rather than {{convert|15|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} using the old procedure. The Mercury-Redstone 4/''Liberty Bell 7'' mission would take advantage of this new procedure.

Additional hardware changes to ''Liberty Bell 7'' were a redesigned fairing for the spacecraft-Redstone adapter clamp-ring and additional foam padding added to the head area of the contour couch. The fairing changes and additional foam were used to reduce vibrations the pilot experienced during the boost phase of flight. The spacecraft instrument panel was rearranged to provide a better eye scan pattern.

==Mission description==
In January 1961, NASA's Director of the [[Space Task Group]], [[Robert Gilruth]], told [[Gus Grissom]] that he would be the primary pilot for Mercury 4. [[John Glenn]] was the backup pilot for the mission.

Redstone launch vehicle MRLV-8 arrived at Cape Canaveral on June 8, 1961. A mission review on July 15, 1961, pronounced Redstone MRLV-8 and Mercury spacecraft #11 ready to go for the Mercury 4 mission.

Also, on July 15, 1961, Gus Grissom announced he would name Mercury 4, ''Liberty Bell 7''. Grissom said the name was an appropriate call-sign for the bell-shaped spacecraft. He also said the name was synonymous with "freedom". As a tribute to the original [[Liberty Bell]], a "crack" was painted on the side of the spacecraft.

The Mercury 4 mission was planned as a repeat of MR-3. It was to reach an apogee of {{convert|116|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The planned range was {{convert|299|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Grissom would experience a maximum acceleration of 6.33&amp;nbsp;''g'' (62&amp;nbsp;m/s²) and deceleration of 10.96&amp;nbsp;''g'' (107&amp;nbsp;m/s²).

The launch of ''Liberty Bell 7'' was first planned for July 16. The cloud cover was too thick and the launch was postponed until July 18. On July 18, it was again postponed due to weather. Both times, the pilot had not yet boarded the spacecraft. On July 19, 1961, Grissom was on board when the flight was delayed again due to weather. At that point, it had just 10 minutes 30 seconds to go before launch.

On the morning of July 21, 1961, Gus Grissom entered the ''Liberty Bell 7'' at 8:58 UTC and the 70 hatch bolts were put in place. At 45 minutes prior to the scheduled launch, a pad technician discovered that one of the hatch bolts was misaligned. During a 30-minute hold that was called, McDonnell and NASA Space Task Group engineers decided that the 69 remaining bolts should be sufficient to hold the hatch in place and blow it at the appropriate time. The misaligned bolt was not replaced.

''Liberty Bell 7'' was launched at 12:20:36 UTC, July 21, 1961.

===Launch===
[[File:Mercury-Redstone 4 Launch MSFC-6414824.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Launch of Mercury-Redstone 4]]
Grissom later admitted at the postflight debriefing that he was "a bit scared" at liftoff, but he added that he soon gained confidence along with the acceleration increase. Hearing the engine roar at the pedestal, he thought that his elapsed-time clock had started late. Like Shepard, he was amazed at the smooth quality of the liftoff, but then he noticed gradually more severe vibrations. These were never violent enough to impair his vision.

Grissom's cabin pressure sealed off at the proper altitude, about {{convert|27000|ft|km|abbr=on}}, and he felt elated that the environmental control system was in good working order. The suit and cabin temperatures, respectively about {{convert|57.5|and|97|F|C}} were quite comfortable. Watching his instruments for the pitch rate of the Redstone, Grissom saw it follow directions as programmed, tilting over at about one deg/s.

During a three ''g'' (29&amp;nbsp;m/s²) acceleration on the up-leg of his flight, Grissom noticed a sudden change in the color of the horizon from light blue to jet black. His attention was distracted by the noise of the tower-jettison rocket firing on schedule. Grissom felt the separation, and he watched the tower through the window as it drifted off, trailing smoke, to his right. At two minutes and 22 seconds after launch, the Redstone's Rocketdyne engine cut off after building a speed of 6,561&amp;nbsp;ft/s (1&amp;nbsp;969&amp;nbsp;m/s). Grissom had a strong sensation of tumbling during the transition from high to zero acceleration, and, while he had become familiar with this sensation in centrifuge training, for a moment he lost his bearings.

The Redstone coasted for 10 seconds after its engine cut off; then a sharp report signaled that the posigrade rockets were popping the spacecraft loose from the booster. Although Grissom peered out his window throughout his ship's turnaround maneuver, he never caught sight of his booster.

===Ballistic flight===
With turnaround accomplished, the Air Force jet pilot for the first time became a space pilot, assuming manual-proportional control. A constant urge to look out the window made concentrating on his control tasks difficult. He told Shepard back in Mercury Control that the panorama of Earth's horizon, presenting an 800&amp;nbsp;mi (1&amp;nbsp;300&amp;nbsp;km) arc at peak altitude, was fascinating. His instruments rated a poor second to the spectacle below.

Turning reluctantly to his dials and control stick, Grissom made a pitch movement change, but was past his desired mark. He jockeyed the handcontroller stick for position, trying to damp out all oscillations, then made a yaw movement and went too far in that direction. By the time the proper attitude was attained, the short time allocated for these maneuvers had been used, so he omitted the roll movement altogether. Grissom found the manual controls very sluggish when compared to the Mercury procedures trainer. He then switched to the new rate command control system and found perfect response, although fuel consumption was high.

After the pitch and yaw maneuvers, Grissom made a roll-over movement so he could see the ground from his window. Some land beneath the clouds (later determined to be western Florida around the Apalachicola area) appeared in the hazy distance, but the pilot was unable to identify it. Suddenly Cape Canaveral came into view so clearly that Grissom found it hard to believe that his slant-range was over {{convert|150|mi|km|abbr=on}}.

He saw Merritt Island, the Banana River, the Indian River, and what appeared to be a large airport runway. South of Cape Canaveral, he saw what he believed to be West Palm Beach.

===Reentry===
With ''Liberty Bell 7'' at an altitude of {{convert|118.26|mi|km|abbr=on}}, it was now time to position the spacecraft in its reentry attitude. Grissom had initiated the retrorocket sequence and the spacecraft was arcing downward. His pulse reached 171 beats per minute. Retrofire gave him the distinct and peculiar feeling that he had reversed his backward flight through space and was actually moving face forward. As he plummeted downward, he saw what appeared to be two of the spent retrorockets pass across the periscope view after the retrorocket package had been jettisoned.

Pitching the spacecraft over into a reentry attitude of 14 degrees from Earth-vertical, the pilot tried to see the stars out his observation window. Instead the glare of sunlight filled his cabin, making it difficult to read the panel dials, particularly those with blue lights. Grissom thought that he would not have noticed the 0.05&amp;nbsp;''g'' (0.5&amp;nbsp;m/s²) light if he had not known it was about to flash on.

Reentry presented no problem. Grissom could not feel the oscillations following the acceleration buildup; he could only read them on the rate indicators. Meanwhile, he continued to report to the Mercury Control Center on his electric current reading, fuel quantity, acceleration, and other instrument indications. Condensation and smoke trailed off the heatshield at about {{convert|65000|ft|km|abbr=on}} as ''Liberty Bell 7'' plunged back into the atmosphere.

The [[drogue parachute]] deployed on schedule at {{convert|21000|ft|km|abbr=on}}. Grissom said he saw the deployment and felt some resulting pulsating motion, but not enough to worry him. Main parachute deployment occurred at {{convert|12300|ft|km|abbr=on}}, which was about {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} higher than the design nominal altitude. Watching the main chute unfurl, Grissom spotted a {{convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on}} L-shaped tear and another {{convert|2|in|mm|abbr=on}} puncture in the canopy. Although he worried about them, the holes grew no bigger and his rate of descent soon slowed to about {{convert|28|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Dumping his peroxide control fuel, the pilot began transmitting his panel readings.

===Splashdown===
A "clunk" confirmed that the landing bag had dropped in preparation for impact. Grissom then removed his oxygen hose and opened his visor, but deliberately left the suit ventilation hose attached. Impact was milder than he had expected, although the spacecraft heeled over in the water until Grissom was lying on his left side. He thought he was facing downward. The spacecraft gradually righted itself, and, as the window cleared the water, Grissom jettisoned the reserve parachute and activated the rescue aids switch. ''Liberty Bell 7'' still appeared to be watertight, although it was rolling badly with the swells.

Preparing for recovery, he disconnected his helmet and checked himself for debarkation. The neck dam did not unroll easily; Grissom tinkered with his suit collar to ensure his buoyancy in the event that he had to get out of the spacecraft quickly. When the recovery helicopters, which had taken to the air at launch time and visually followed the contrails and parachute descent, were still about {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the impact point, which was only {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} beyond the bullseye, Lieutenant James L. Lewis, the pilot of the primary recovery helicopter, radioed Grissom to ask if he was ready for pickup. He replied that he wanted them to wait five minutes while he recorded his cockpit panel data. Using a grease pencil with the pressure suit gloves was awkward, and several times the suit ventilation caused the neck dam to balloon, but Grissom simply placed his finger between neck and dam to allow the air to escape.

====Hatch blows open====
[[Image:Grissom lifted from water 61-MR4-82.jpg|thumb|upright|Grissom is hoisted to safety following the sinking of ''Liberty Bell 7'']]
After logging the panel data, Grissom asked the helicopters to begin the approach for pickup. He removed the pin from the hatch-cover detonator and lay back in the couch. "I was lying there, minding my own business," he said afterward, "when I heard a dull thud." The hatch cover blew away, and salt water swished into the spacecraft as it bobbed in the ocean. The capsule began taking on water and was sinking fast.

Grissom had difficulty recollecting his actions at this point, but he was certain that he had not touched the hatch-activation plunger. He had earlier unbuckled himself from most of his harness; he now removed his helmet, grasped the instrument panel with his right hand, and climbed though the hatchway.

The copilot of the nearest recovery helicopter said that as he was preparing, per procedure, to cut off the spacecraft's antenna whip with a squib-actuated cutter at the end of a pole, the hatch cover flew off, struck the water about {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} away, then skipped over the waves. Next he saw Grissom climb through the hatch and swim away.

====Failed spacecraft recovery====
[[File:Failed Attempt to Recover Liberty Bell 7 - GPN-2002-000047.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sikorsky H-34|HUS-1]] helicopter attempting to recover the ''Liberty Bell 7'' spacecraft. The recovery ship {{USS|Randolph|CVS-15|6}} is visible in the distance.]]

Leaving aside the swimming astronaut, Lewis completed his approach to the sinking spacecraft, as both he and Reinhard were intent on spacecraft recovery. This action was a conditioned reflex based on past training experience. While training off the Virginia beaches the helicopter pilots had noted that the astronauts seemed at home in and to enjoy the water. So Reinhard quickly cut the high-frequency antenna as soon as the helicopter reached ''Liberty Bell 7''. Throwing aside the antenna cutting device, Reinhard picked up the shepherd's-hook recovery pole and carefully threaded the crook through the recovery loop on top of the spacecraft. By this time Lewis had lowered the helicopter to assist Reinhard in his task to a point that the helicopter's three wheels were in the water. The capsule sank out of sight, but the pickup pole tangled as the attached cable went taut, indicating to the helicopter pilots that they had made the catch.

Reinhard immediately prepared to pass the floating astronaut the personnel hoist, but at that moment Lewis called a warning that a detector light had flashed on the instrument panel, indicating that metal chips were in the oil sump because of engine strain. Considering the implication of impending engine failure, Lewis told Reinhard to retract the personnel hoist while he called the second helicopter to retrieve Grissom.

Meanwhile, Grissom, having made certain that he was not snared by any lines, noticed that the primary helicopter was having trouble raising the submerged spacecraft. He swam back to the spacecraft to see if he could assist, but found the cable properly attached. When he looked up for the personnel line, he saw the helicopter start to move away.

Suddenly, Grissom realized that he was not riding as high in the water as he had been. All the time he had been in the water he kept feeling air escape through the neck dam. The more air he lost, the less buoyancy he had. Moreover, he had forgotten to secure his suit inlet valve. Swimming was becoming difficult, and now with the second helicopter moving in he found the rotor wash between the two aircraft was making swimming more difficult. Bobbing under the waves, Grissom was scared, angry, and looking for a swimmer from one of the helicopters to help him tread water. Then he caught sight of a familiar face, that of George Cox, aboard the second helicopter. Cox was the copilot who had retrieved both the chimpanzee Ham and Shepard on the first Mercury flight. With his head barely above water, Grissom found the sight of Cox heartening.

Cox tossed the "horse-collar" lifeline straight to Grissom, who immediately wrapped himself into the sling backwards. Lack of orthodoxy mattered little to Grissom now, for he was on his way to the safety of the helicopter, even though swells dunked him twice more before he got aboard. His first thought was to get a life preserver on. Grissom had been either swimming or floating for a period of only four or five minutes, "although it seemed like an eternity to me," as he said afterward.

As the first helicopter moved away from Grissom, it struggled to raise the spacecraft high enough to drain the water from the impact bag. At one point the spacecraft was almost clear of the water, but like an anchor it prevented the helicopter from moving forward. The flooded capsule weighed over {{convert|5000|lb|kg}}, {{convert|1000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} beyond the helicopter's lifting capacity. The pilot, watching his insistent red warning light, decided not to chance losing two craft in one day. He finally cast loose, allowing the spacecraft to sink swiftly. Martin Byrnes, aboard the carrier, suggested that a marker be placed at the point so that the spacecraft might be recovered later. Rear Admiral J. E. Clark advised Byrnes that in that area the depth was about {{convert|2800|fathom|km ft mi|lk=in}}.

====Aftermath====
Substantial controversy ensued, as Grissom reported that the hatch had blown prematurely without his authorization. An independent technical review of the incident between August and October 1961 raised doubts regarding the theory that Grissom had blown the hatch and was responsible for the loss of the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="Evans2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Evans|title=Escaping the Bonds of Earth: The Fifties and the Sixties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zCL6BoE2HU4C&amp;pg=PA107|date=April 2, 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-79094-7|pages=107–}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is strong evidence that the [[Astronaut Office]] did not accept Grissom's guilt in the fact that he was maintained in the prime rotation spot for future flights, commanding the first [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] flight, and the first planned [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] flight.&lt;ref name="Evans2010"/&gt;

Three Mercury flights later, Astronaut [[Wally Schirra]] manually blew ''[[Mercury-Atlas 8|Sigma 7]]'''s hatch after recovery when his spacecraft was on the deck of the recovery ship, in a deliberate attempt to dispel the rumor that Grissom might have blown the capsule's hatch deliberately. As anticipated, the kickback from the manual trigger left Schirra with a visible injury to his right hand. Grissom was uninjured when he exited the spacecraft, as documented by his postflight physical. This strongly supports his assertion that he did not "accidentally" hit the trigger, since in that case he would have been even more likely to injure himself than with intentional activation.&lt;ref&gt;French, F.; Burgess, C. (2007). ''Into That Silent Sea: Trailblazers of the Space Era, 1961-1965'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press ({{ISBN|978-0-8032-1146-9}}), 93&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1965 interview, Grissom said that he believed the external release lanyard came loose, triggering the hatch release. On the ''Liberty Bell 7'', this release lanyard was held in place by only one screw. This theory was accepted by [[Guenter Wendt]], the Pad Leader for most early American manned spaceflights.&lt;ref name="BisneyPickering2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Bisney|author2=J. L. Pickering|title=Spaceshots and Snapshots of Projects Mercury and Gemini: A Rare Photographic History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_CBADAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15|date=April 25, 2016|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=978-0-8263-5263-7|pages=15–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a launch simulation on [[Apollo 1]] in 1967, the combination of a cabin fire and an inward opening hatch contributed to the death of Grissom, as well as that of the astronauts [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] and [[Roger B. Chaffee]] in a launch-pad fire. Use of an explosive hatch had been rejected following the discovery by engineers that, in fact, an explosive egress system on a spacecraft could inadvertently fire without being triggered. Following the Apollo fire, Block II Apollo spacecraft were equipped with rapid-opening systems.

===Recovery of ''Liberty Bell 7''===
[[File:Liberty Bell 7 1999.jpg|thumb|upright|''Liberty Bell 7'' was recovered in 1999]]
[[File:2006LibertyBell7Display.JPG|thumb|right|The restored spacecraft is currently displayed at the [[Cosmosphere]] in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]].]]
After several unsuccessful attempts in 1992 and 1993, [[Oceaneering International]], Inc. lifted the ''Liberty Bell 7'' off the floor of the Atlantic Ocean and onto the deck of a recovery ship on July 20, 1999, the 30th anniversary of the [[Apollo 11]] lunar landing.&lt;ref name="Angelo2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph A.

The spacecraft was found after a 14-year effort by Newport at a depth of nearly {{convert|16000|ft|m|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ocean News &amp; Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tHseAQAAIAAJ|publisher=Technology Systems Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|300|nmi|smi km|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Cape Canaveral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Air &amp; Space Smithsonian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TDBWAAAAMAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Smithsonian Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Among the items found within were part of the flight gear and several Mercury head dimes which were taken to space to be souvenirs of the flight.&lt;ref name="Angelo2014"/&gt;

After ''Liberty Bell 7'' was secured on the deck of the recovery ship, the "Ocean Project", experts removed and disposed of an explosive device ([[SOFAR bomb]]) that was supposed to detonate in the event of the spacecraft's sinking, but which failed to explode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Materials Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RPtVAAAAMAAJ|date=July 1999|publisher=National Association of Corrosion Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft was then placed in a container filled with seawater to prevent further corrosion. The [[Cosmosphere]], in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]], disassembled and cleaned the spacecraft,&lt;ref name="Greenberger2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Greenberger|title=Gus Grissom: The Tragedy of Apollo 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAa6aHVpb9gC&amp;pg=PA54|date=October 1, 2003|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-4458-3|pages=54–}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and it was released for a national tour through September 15, 2006. The spacecraft was then returned to the Cosmosphere where it is on permanent display. In 2016, it was temporarily lent to [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]].&lt;ref name=UXB&gt;

'''Mersenne's laws''' are [[scientific law|laws]] describing the [[frequency]] of [[oscillation]] of a stretched [[Strings (music)|string]] or [[monochord]],&lt;ref name="Jeans"/&gt; useful in [[musical tuning]] and [[musical instrument construction]]. The equation was first proposed by French mathematician and music theorist [[Marin Mersenne]] in his 1637 work ''[[Traité de l'harmonie universelle]]''.&lt;ref name="mersenne"&gt;Mersenne, Marin (1637). ''Traité de l'harmonie universelle'', {{page needed|date=October 2013}}. via the [[Bavarian State Library]]. Cited in "[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/MersennesLaws.html Mersenne's Laws]", ''[[Wolfram Research|Wolfram.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Mersenne's laws govern the construction and operation of [[string instruments]], such as [[piano]]s and [[harp]]s, which must accommodate the total tension force required to keep the strings at the proper pitch. Lower strings are thicker, thus having a greater [[mass]] per unit length. They typically have lower [[Tension (physics)|tension]]. Guitars are a familiar exception to this - string tensions are similar, for playability, so lower string pitch is largely achieved with increased mass per length.{{notetag|Mass is typically added by increasing cross-section area. This increases the string's force constant (k). Higher k doesn't affect pitch ''per se'', but fretting a string stretches it in addition to shortening it, and the pitch increase due to stretching is larger for higher k values. Thus ''intonation'' requires more compensation for lower strings, and (markedly) for steel vs nylon. This effect still applies to strings where mass is increased with windings, albeit to a lesser extent, because the core that supports string tension generally needs to be larger to support larger masses of winding.}} Higher-pitched strings typically are thinner, have higher tension, and may be shorter. "This result does not differ substantially from [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s, yet it is rightly known as Mersenne's law," because Mersenne physically proved their truth through experiments (while Galileo considered their proof impossible&lt;!--how does one count something that is too fast for one to see?--&gt;).&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen, H.F. (2013). ''Quantifying Music: The Science of Music at the First Stage of Scientific Revolution 1580–1650'', p.101. Springer. {{ISBN|9789401576864}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Mersenne investigated and refined these relationships by experiment but did not himself originate them".&lt;ref name="Gozza"&gt;Gozza, Paolo; ed. (2013). ''Number to Sound: The Musical Way to the Scientific Revolution'', p.279. Springer. {{ISBN|9789401595780}}. Gozza is referring to statements by Sigalia Dostrovsky's "Early Vibration Theory", p.185-187.&lt;/ref&gt; Though his theories are correct, his measurements are not very exact, and his calculations were greatly improved by [[Joseph Sauveur]] (1653–1716) through the use of [[acoustic beat]]s and [[metronome]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Robert Thomas (1999). ''Sounds of Our Times: Two Hundred Years of Acoustics''. Springer. p.10. {{ISBN|978-0-387-98435-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{notefoot}}

==Equations==
The [[fundamental frequency]] is:

*a) Inversely [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]]al to the [[length]] of the string (the law of Pythagoras&lt;ref name="Jeans"/&gt;),
*b) Proportional to the [[square root]] of the stretching force, and
*c) Inversely proportional to the square root of the [[mass]] per unit length.

:&lt;math&gt; f_0 \propto \tfrac{1}{L}.&lt;/math&gt; (equation 26)

:&lt;math&gt; f_0 \propto \sqrt{F}.&lt;/math&gt; (equation 27)

:&lt;math&gt;  f_0 \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu}}.&lt;/math&gt; (equation 28)

Thus, for example, all other properties of the string being equal, to make the note one octave higher (2/1) one would need either to decrease its length by half (1/2), to increase the tension to the square (4), or to decrease its mass per unit length by the inverse square (1/4).

|}

These laws are derived from Mersenne's equation 22:&lt;ref name="Steinhaus"&gt;Steinhaus, Hugo (1999). ''Mathematical Snapshots'', {{page needed|date=October 2013}}. Dover, {{ISBN|9780486409146}}. Cited in "[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/MersennesLaws.html Mersenne's Laws]", ''[[Wolfram Research|Wolfram.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; f_0 = \frac{\nu}{\lambda} = \frac{1}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{F}{\mu}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[formula]] for the [[fundamental frequency]] is:
:&lt;math&gt; f_0=\frac{1}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{F}{\mu}}, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is the frequency, ''L'' is the length, ''F'' is the force and ''&amp;mu;'' is the mass per unit length.

Similar laws were not developed for pipes and wind instruments at the same time since Mersenne's laws predate the conception of [[Wind instrument#Physics of sound production|wind instrument pitch]] being dependent on longitudinal waves rather than "percussion".&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

== Fabrication ==

Some considerations for microfluidic devices relating to cell culture include:
* fabrication material (e.g., [[Polydimethylsiloxane|polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)]], [[polystyrene]])
* culture region geometry
* control system for delivering and removing [[Growth medium|media]] when needed using either passive methods (e.g., [[Gravity flow system|gravity-driven flow]], [[Capillary action|capillary pumps]], or [[Laplace pressure]] based ‘passive pumping’) or a [[Volumetric flow rate|flow-rate]] controlled device (i.e., [[perfusion]] system)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cho|first=Brenda S.|last2=Schuster|first2=Timothy G.|last3=Zhu|first3=Xiaoyue|last4=Chang|first4=David|last5=Smith|first5=Gary D.|last6=Takayama|first6=Shuichi|date=2003-04-01|title=Passively Driven Integrated Microfluidic System for Separation of Motile Sperm|journal=Analytical Chemistry|volume=75|issue=7|pages=1671–1675|doi=10.1021/ac020579e|issn=0003-2700}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimmermann M, Schmid H, Hunziker P, Delamarche E | title = Capillary pumps for autonomous capillary systems | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 119–25 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17180214 | doi = 10.1039/b609813d }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker G, Beebe DJ | title = A passive pumping method for microfluidic devices | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 131–4 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 15100822 | doi = 10.1039/b204381e | citeseerx = 10.1.1.118.5648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim L, Toh YC, Voldman J, Yu H | title = A practical guide to microfluidic perfusion culture of adherent mammalian cells | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 681–94 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17538709 | doi = 10.1039/b704602b }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fabrication material is crucial as not all [[polymer]]s are biocompatible, with some materials such as PDMS causing undesirable [[adsorption]] or [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] of small molecules.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Regehr KJ, Domenech M, Koepsel JT, Carver KC, Ellison-Zelski SJ, Murphy WL, Schuler LA, Alarid ET, Beebe DJ | title = Biological implications of polydimethylsiloxane-based microfluidic cell culture | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 9 | issue = 15 | pages = 2132–9 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19606288 | pmc = 2792742 | doi = 10.1039/b903043c }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Halldorsson S, Lucumi E, Gómez-Sjöberg R, Fleming RM | title = Advantages and challenges of microfluidic cell culture in polydimethylsiloxane devices | journal = Biosensors &amp; Bioelectronics | volume = 63 | pages = 218–231 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25105943 | doi = 10.1016/j.bios.2014.07.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, uncured PDMS oligomers can leach into the cell culture media, which can harm the microenvironment.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; As an alternative to commonly used PDMS, there have been advances in the use of [[thermoplastic]]s (e.g., polystyrene) as a replacement material.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berthier E, Young EW, Beebe D | title = Engineers are from PDMS-land, Biologists are from Polystyrenia | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 1224–37 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22318426 | doi = 10.1039/c2lc20982a }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Midwoud PM, Janse A, Merema MT, Groothuis GM, Verpoorte E | title = Comparison of biocompatibility and adsorption properties of different plastics for advanced microfluidic cell and tissue culture models | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 84 | issue = 9 | pages = 3938–44 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22444457 | doi = 10.1021/ac300771z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spatial organization of cells in microscale devices largely depends on the culture region geometry for cells to perform functions ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rhee SW, Taylor AM, Tu CH, Cribbs DH, Cotman CW, Jeon NL | title = Patterned cell culture inside microfluidic devices | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 102–7 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15616747 | doi = 10.1039/b403091e | hdl = 10371/7982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Folch A, Toner M | title = Cellular micropatterns on biocompatible materials | journal = Biotechnology Progress | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 388–92 | date = 1998-01-01 | pmid = 9622519 | doi = 10.1021/bp980037b }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, long, narrow channels may be desired to culture [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The perfusion system chosen might also affect the geometry chosen. For example, in a system that incorporates syringe pumps, channels for perfusion inlet, perfusion outlet, waste, and cell loading would need to be added for the cell culture maintenance.&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hung PJ, Lee PJ, Sabounchi P, Lin R, Lee LP | title = Continuous perfusion microfluidic cell culture array for high-throughput cell-based assays | journal = Biotechnology and Bioengineering | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15580587 | doi = 10.1002/bit.20289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perfusion in microfluidic cell culture is important to enable long culture periods on-chip and [[Cellular differentiation|cell differentiation]].&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tourovskaia A, Figueroa-Masot X, Folch A | title = Differentiation-on-a-chip: a microfluidic platform for long-term cell culture studies | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 14–9 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15616734 | doi = 10.1039/b405719h  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critical aspects for controlling the microenvironment include: cell seeding density, reduction of air bubbles as they can rupture cell membranes, evaporation of media due to an insufficiently humid environment, and cell culture maintenance (i.e. regular, timely media changes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meyvantsson I, Beebe DJ | title = Cell culture models in microfluidic systems | journal = Annual Review of Analytical Chemistry | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 423–49 | date = 2008-06-13 | pmid = 20636085 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anchem.1.031207.113042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu H, Alexander CM, Beebe DJ | title = Understanding microchannel culture: parameters involved in soluble factor signaling | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 726–30 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17538714 | doi = 10.1039/b618793e  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

Some of the major advantages of microfluidic cell culture include reduced sample volumes (especially important when using primary cells, which are often limited) and the flexibility to customize and study multiple microenvironments within the same device.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mehling M, Tay S | title = Microfluidic cell culture | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 25 | pages = 95–102 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24484886 | doi = 10.1016/j.copbio.2013.10.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A reduced cell population can also be used in a microscale system (e.g., a few hundred cells) in comparison to macroscale culture systems (which often require 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cells); this can make studying certain cell-cell interactions more accessible.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Halldorsson S, Lucumi E, Gómez-Sjöberg R, Fleming RM | title = Advantages and challenges of microfluidic cell culture in polydimethylsiloxane devices | journal = Biosensors &amp; Bioelectronics | volume = 63 | pages = 218–231 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25105943 | doi = 10.1016/j.bios.2014.07.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These reduced cell numbers make studying non-dividing or slow dividing cells (e.g., [[stem cell]]s) easier than traditional culture methods (e.g., flasks, petri dishes, or well plates) due to the smaller sample volumes.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gómez-Sjöberg R, Leyrat AA, Pirone DM, Chen CS, Quake SR | title = Versatile, fully automated, microfluidic cell culture system | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 79 | issue = 22 | pages = 8557–63 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17953452 | doi = 10.1021/ac071311w }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the small dimensions in microfluidics, [[laminar flow]] can be achieved, allowing manipulations with the culture system to be done easily without affecting other culture chambers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Laminar flow is also useful as is it mimics ''in vivo'' fluid dynamics more accurately, often making microscale culture more relevant than traditional culture methods.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cimetta E, Vunjak-Novakovic G | title = Microscale technologies for regulating human stem cell differentiation | journal = Experimental Biology and Medicine | volume = 239 | issue = 9 | pages = 1255–63 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24737735 | pmc = 4476254 | doi = 10.1177/1535370214530369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture Platforms ==

=== Two-dimensional culture ===

Two-dimensional (2D) cell culture is cell culture that takes place on a flat surface, e.g. the bottom of a well-plate, and is known as the conventional method.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhatia SN, Ingber DE | title = Microfluidic organs-on-chips | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 8 | pages = 760–72 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25093883 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While these platforms are useful for growing and passaging cells to be used in subsequent experiments, they are not ideal environments to monitor cell responses to stimuli as cells cannot freely move or perform functions as observed ''in vivo'' that are dependent on cell-extracellular matrix material interactions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Three-dimensional culture ===

[[3D cell culture|Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture]] is cell culture that takes place in a biologically relevant matrix, usually this involves cells being embedded in a [[hydrogel]] containing extracellular molecules (e.g., [[collagen]]).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; By adding an additional dimension, more advanced cell architectures can be achieved, and cell behavior is more representative of ''in vivo'' dynamics; cells can engage in enhanced communication with neighboring cells and cell-extracellular matrix interactions can be modeled.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pampaloni F, Reynaud EG, Stelzer EH | title = The third dimension bridges the gap between cell culture and live tissue | journal = Nature Reviews.

Some of the challenges include: imaging of the cells, control of gradients in static models (i.e., without a perfusion system), and difficulty recreating [[vasculature]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Despite these challenges, 3D models are still used as tools for studying and testing drug responses in [[Pharmacology|pharmacological]] studies.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In recent years, there are microfluidic devices reproducing the complex ''in vivo'' microvascular network.

'''NGC 171''' is a [[barred spiral galaxy]] with an apparent magnitude of 12, located around 3 million light-years away in the constellation [[Cetus]]. The galaxy has 2 main medium-wound arms, with a few minor arms, and a fairly bright nucleus and bulge. It was discovered on 20 October 1784 by [[William Herschel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cseligman.com/text/atlas/ngc1a.htm#171|title=New General Catalog Objects: NGC 150 - 199|website=cseligman.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as '''NGC 175'''.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

"I told him he was welcome to it," Tombaugh later remembered, "though he's got to go one long, cold trip."&lt;ref name="Sobel1993"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://discovermagazine.com/1993/may/thelastworld215 |title=The Last World |magazine=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |first=Dava |last=Sobel |date=May 1993 |accessdate=April 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The call eventually led to a series of proposed Pluto missions, leading up to ''New Horizons''.

Stamatios "Tom" Krimigis, head of the [[Applied Physics Laboratory]]'s space division, one of many entrants in the New Frontiers Program competition, formed the ''New Horizons'' team with Alan Stern in December 2000.  Appointed as the project's [[principal investigator]], Stern was described by Krimigis as "the personification of the Pluto mission".&lt;ref name="alan-stern"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hand |first1=Eric |title=Feature: How Alan Stern's tenacity, drive, and command got a NASA spacecraft to Pluto |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/people-events/2015/06/feature-how-alan-stern-s-tenacity-drive-and-command-got-nasa-spacecraft-pluto |website=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |date=June 25, 2015 |accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New Horizons'' was based largely on Stern's work since ''Pluto 350'' and involved most of the team from ''Pluto Kuiper Express''.&lt;ref name="newhorizonsbook"&gt;[[Alan Stern|Stern, Alan]]; {{cite book |last1=Christopher |first1=Russell |title=New Horizons: Reconnaissance of the Pluto-Charon System and the Kuiper Belt |date=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-89518-5 |pages=6, 7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZfpYIUKDrUC&amp;pg |accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New Horizons'' proposal was one of five that were officially submitted to NASA. It was later selected as one of two finalists to be subject to a three-month concept study, in June 2001. The other finalist, POSSE (Pluto and Outer Solar System Explorer), was a separate, but similar Pluto mission concept by the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], led by principal investigator [[Larry W. Esposito]], and supported by the JPL, [[Lockheed Martin]] and the [[University of California]].&lt;ref name="new-frontiers-finalists"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Savage |first1=Donald |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/text/pluto_pr_20010606.txt |title=NASA Selects Two Investigations for Pluto-Kuiper Belt Mission Feasibility Studies |publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)]] |date=June 6, 2001 |accessdate=July 9, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZsBVxTQw?url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/text/pluto_pr_20010606.txt |archivedate=July 8, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the APL, in addition to being supported by ''Pluto Kuiper Express'' developers at the Goddard Space Flight Center and [[Stanford University]],&lt;ref name="new-frontiers-finalists"/&gt; were at an advantage; they had recently developed ''NEAR Shoemaker'' for NASA, which had successfully entered orbit around [[433 Eros]] earlier in the year, and would later land on the asteroid to scientific and engineering fanfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Savage |first1=Donald |title=NEAR Shoemaker's Historic Landing on Eros Exceeds Science, Engineering Expectations |url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/display.cfm?News_ID=683 |website=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)]] |date=February 14, 2001 |accessdate=July 8, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709132201/https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/display.cfm?News_ID=683 |archivedate=July 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush|Bush Administration]], [[Sean O'Keefe]], was not supportive of ''New Horizons'', and effectively cancelled it by not including it in NASA's budget for 2003. NASA's Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate [[Ed Weiler]] prompted Stern to lobby for the funding of ''New Horizons'' in hopes of the mission appearing in the [[Planetary Science Decadal Survey]]; a prioritized "wish list", compiled by the [[United States National Research Council]], that reflects the opinions of the scientific community. After an intense campaign to gain support for ''New Horizons'', the Planetary Science Decadal Survey of 2003–2013 was published in the summer of 2002. ''New Horizons'' topped the list of projects considered the highest priority among the scientific community in the medium-size category; ahead of missions to the Moon, and even Jupiter. Weiler stated that it was a result that "[his] administration was not going to fight".&lt;ref name="alan-stern"/&gt; Funding for the mission was finally secured following the publication of the report, and Stern's team were finally able to start building the spacecraft and its instruments, with a planned launch in January 2006 and arrival at Pluto in 2015.&lt;ref name="alan-stern"/&gt; [[Alice Bowman]] became Mission Operations Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jhuapl.edu/employment/meet/bowman.asp |title=Alice Bowman: APL's First Female MOM |publisher=Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory |access-date=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''New Horizons'' is the first mission in NASA's New Frontiers mission category, larger and more expensive than the Discovery missions but smaller than the Flagship Program. The cost of the mission (including spacecraft and instrument development, launch vehicle, mission operations, data analysis, and education/public outreach) is approximately $700&amp;nbsp;million over 15 years (2001–2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2015/07/14/how-do-new-horizons-costs-compare-to-other-space-missions/ |date=July 14, 2015 |title=How Do New Horizons Costs Compare To Other Space Missions? |first=Alex |last=Knapp |journal=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft was built primarily by [[Southwest Research Institute]] (SwRI) and the [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] Applied Physics Laboratory. The mission's principal investigator is Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute (formerly NASA Associate Administrator).

After separation from the launch vehicle, overall control was taken by Mission Operations Center (MOC) at the Applied Physics Laboratory in [[Howard County, Maryland]].

Coincidentally the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station was where the photographic plates were taken for the discovery of Pluto's moon [[Charon (moon)|Charon]]; and the Naval Observatory is itself not far from the [[Lowell Observatory]] where Pluto was discovered.

''New Horizons'' was originally planned as a voyage to the only unexplored planet in the Solar{{space}}System. When the spacecraft was launched, Pluto was still classified as a [[planet]], later to be [[IAU definition of planet|reclassified]] as a dwarf planet by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU). Some members of the ''New Horizons'' team, including Alan Stern, disagree with the IAU definition and still describe Pluto as the ninth planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unabashedly Onward to the Ninth Planet |work=New Horizons website |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/overview/piPerspective.php?page=piPerspective_09_06_2006. |publisher=Johns Hopkins/APL |accessdate=October 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x3rrNEcY?url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/overview/piPerspective.php?page=piPerspective_09_06_2006 |archivedate=March 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pluto's satellites [[Nix (moon)|Nix]] and [[Hydra (moon)|Hydra]] also have a connection with the spacecraft: the first letters of their names (N and H) are the initials of ''New Horizons''.

Many subsystems and components have flight heritage from APL's [[CONTOUR]] spacecraft, which in turn had heritage from APL's [[TIMED]] spacecraft.

''New Horizons''{{'}} body forms a triangle, almost {{cvt|2.5|ft|m|order=flip}} thick. (The ''Pioneers'' have [[hexagon]]al bodies, whereas the [[Voyager program|''Voyagers'']], ''Galileo'', and ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'' have [[decagon]]al, hollow bodies.) A [[7075 aluminium alloy]] tube forms the main structural column, between the launch vehicle adapter ring at the "rear," and the {{cvt|2.1|m}} radio [[dish antenna]] affixed to the "front" flat side. The [[titanium]] fuel tank is in this tube. The RTG attaches with a 4-sided titanium mount resembling a gray pyramid or stepstool. Titanium provides strength and thermal isolation. The rest of the triangle is primarily sandwich panels of thin aluminium facesheet (less than {{cvt|1/64|in|mm|2|disp=or}}) bonded to aluminium honeycomb core. The structure is larger than strictly necessary, with empty space inside. The structure is designed to act as [[Radiation hardening|shielding]], reducing electronics [[Single event upset|errors caused by radiation]] from the RTG. Also, the mass distribution required for a spinning spacecraft demands a wider triangle.

The interior structure is painted black to equalize temperature by [[Thermal radiation|radiative]] heat transfer. Overall, the spacecraft is thoroughly blanketed to retain heat. Unlike the ''Pioneers'' and ''Voyagers'', the radio dish is also enclosed in blankets that extend to the body. The heat from the RTG adds warmth to the spacecraft while it is in the outer Solar System. While in the inner Solar System, the spacecraft must prevent overheating, hence electronic activity is limited, power is diverted to [[Shunt (electrical)|shunts]] with attached radiators, and [[louver]]s are opened to radiate excess heat. While the spacecraft is cruising inactively in the cold outer Solar System, the louvers are closed, and the shunt regulator reroutes power to electric [[resistor|heaters]].

==== Propulsion and attitude control ====
''New Horizons'' has both spin-stabilized (cruise) and three-axis stabilized (science) modes controlled entirely with [[hydrazine]] [[Monopropellant rocket|monopropellant]]. Additional post launch [[delta-v]] of over {{cvt|290|m/s|km/h mph}} is provided by a {{cvt|77|kg}} internal tank. Helium is used as a pressurant, with an [[elastomer]]ic diaphragm assisting expulsion. The spacecraft's on-orbit mass including fuel is over {{cvt|470|kg}} on the Jupiter flyby trajectory, but would have been only {{cvt|445|kg}} for the backup direct flight option to Pluto. Significantly, had the backup option been taken, this would have meant less fuel for later Kuiper belt operations.

There are 16 [[reaction control system|thrusters]] on ''New Horizons'': four {{cvt|4.4|N|lbf|1|lk=on}} and twelve {{cvt|0.9|N|lbf|1}} plumbed into redundant branches. The larger thrusters are used primarily for trajectory corrections, and the small ones (previously used on ''Cassini'' and the ''Voyager'' spacecraft) are used primarily for [[attitude control]] and spinup/spindown maneuvers. Two star cameras are used to measure the spacecraft attitude. They are mounted on the face of the spacecraft and provide attitude information while in spin-stabilized or 3-axis mode. In between the time of star camera readings, spacecraft orientation is provided by dual redundant [[miniature inertial measurement unit]]s. Each unit contains three solid-state [[gyroscope]]s and three [[accelerometer]]s. Two Adcole [[Attitude control#Sun sensor|Sun sensor]]s provide attitude determination. One detects the angle to the Sun, whereas the other measures spin rate and clocking.

==== Power ====
[[File:RTG and New Horizons in background.jpg|thumb|upright|''New Horizons''{{'}} [[Radioisotope thermoelectric generator|RTG]]]]

A cylindrical [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] (RTG) protrudes in the plane of the triangle from one vertex of the triangle. The RTG provided {{val|245.7|ul=W}} of power at launch, and was predicted to drop approximately 5% every 4{{space}}years, decaying to {{val|200|u=W}} by the time of its encounter with the [[Plutonian system]] in 2015 and will decay too far to power the transmitters in the 2030s.&lt;ref name="tri"/&gt; There are no onboard batteries. RTG output is relatively predictable; load transients are handled by a capacitor bank and fast circuit breakers.

The RTG, model "[[GPHS-RTG]]," was originally a spare from the ''Cassini'' mission. The RTG contains {{cvt|9.75|kg|lb}} of [[plutonium-238]] oxide pellets.&lt;ref name="newhorizonsbook"/&gt; Each pellet is clad in [[iridium]], then encased in a graphite shell. It was developed by the U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] at the Materials and Fuels Complex, a part of the [[Idaho National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Steven |last=Friederich |title=Argonne Lab is developing battery for NASA missions |date=December 16, 2003 |publisher=Idaho State Journal |url=http://www.journalnet.com/articles/2003/12/16/news/local/news02.txt |archiveurl=http://www.matr.net/article-9139.html |archivedate=December 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The original RTG design called for  {{cvt|10.9|kg|lb}} of plutonium, but a unit less powerful than the original design goal was produced because of delays at the United States Department of Energy, including security activities, that delayed plutonium production.&lt;ref name=radioshow&gt;{{cite web |last1=Betts |first1=Bruce |title=Planetary Radio trivia question at 38m28s |url=http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/planetary-radio/show/2015/0728-the-royal-observatory-greenwich-quest-for-longitude.html |website=The Planetary Society |accessdate=August 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission parameters and observation sequence had to be modified for the reduced wattage; still, not all instruments can operate simultaneously. The Department of Energy transferred the space battery program from Ohio to Argonne in 2002 because of security concerns.

The amount of radioactive plutonium in the RTG is about one-third the amount on board the Cassini–Huygens probe when it launched in 1997. That Cassini launch was protested by some. The United States Department of Energy estimated the chances of a New Horizons launch accident that would release radiation into the atmosphere at 1 in 350, and monitored the launch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,181880,00.html |title=Pluto Probe Launch Scrubbed for Tuesday |work=Fox News |date=January 18, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x3s2FqQW?url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,181880,00.html |archivedate=March 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; as it always does when RTGs are involved. It was estimated that a worst-case scenario of total dispersal of on-board plutonium would spread the equivalent radiation of 80% the average annual dosage in North America from background radiation over an area with a radius of {{cvt|105|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the New Horizons Mission |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/overview/deis/docs/NH_DEIS_Full.pdf |publisher=Johns Hopkins APL |accessdate=May 16, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113230746/http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/overview/deis/docs/NH_DEIS_Full.pdf |archive-date=November 13, 2014 |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Flight computer ====
The spacecraft carries two [[computer]] systems: the Command and Data Handling system and the Guidance and Control processor. Each of the two systems is duplicated for [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]], for a total of four computers. The processor used for its flight computers is the [[Mongoose-V]], a 12 [[Megahertz|MHz]] radiation-hardened version of the [[R3000|MIPS R3000]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. Multiple redundant clocks and timing routines are implemented in hardware and software to help prevent faults and downtime. To conserve heat and mass, spacecraft and instrument electronics are housed together in IEMs (integrated electronics modules). There are two redundant IEMs. Including other functions such as instrument and radio electronics, each IEM contains 9{{space}}boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Mission/Spacecraft/Systems-and-Components.php |title=New Horizons |work=jhuapl.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software of the probe runs on [[Nucleus RTOS]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Voica |first1=Alexandru |title=MIPS in space: Inside NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto |url=http://blog.imgtec.com/mips-processors/mips-in-space-inside-nasa-new-horizons-mission-to-pluto |website=Imagination}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been two "safing" events, that sent the spacecraft into [[safe mode (spacecraft)|safe mode]]:
* On March 19, 2007 the Command and Data Handling computer experienced an uncorrectable memory error and rebooted itself, causing the spacecraft to go into safe mode.

==== Telecommunications and data handling ====
[[File:New Horizons - REX.jpeg|thumb|''New Horizons''{{'}} [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]]]]

Communication with the spacecraft is via [[X band]]. The craft had a communication rate of {{val|38|u=kbit/s}} at Jupiter; at Pluto's distance, a rate of approximately {{val|1|ul=kbit/s}} per transmitter is expected. Besides the low data rate, Pluto's distance also causes a [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] of about 4.5&amp;nbsp;hours (one-way). The {{cvt|70|m|adj=on|sp=us}} [[NASA Deep Space Network]] (DSN) dishes are used to relay commands once it is beyond Jupiter.  The spacecraft uses [[dual modular redundancy]] transmitters and receivers, and either right- or left-hand [[circular polarization]].  The downlink signal is amplified by dual redundant 12-watt [[traveling-wave tube]] amplifiers (TWTAs) mounted on the body under the dish. The receivers are new, low-power designs. The system can be controlled to power both TWTAs at the same time, and transmit a dual-polarized downlink signal to the DSN that nearly doubles the downlink rate. DSN tests early in the mission with this dual polarization combining technique were successful, and the capability is now considered operational (when the spacecraft power budget permits both TWTAs to be powered).

In addition to the [[high-gain antenna]], there are two backup low-gain antennas and a medium-gain dish. The high-gain dish has a [[Cassegrain reflector]] layout, composite construction, and a {{convert|2.1|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} diameter providing over {{val|42|ul=dBi}} of gain, has a half-power beam width of about a degree. The prime-focus, medium-gain antenna, with a {{convert|0.3|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} aperture and 10° half-power beam width, is mounted to the back of the high-gain antenna's secondary reflector. The forward low-gain antenna is stacked atop the feed of the medium-gain antenna. The aft low-gain antenna is mounted within the launch adapter at the rear of the spacecraft. This antenna was used only for early mission phases near Earth, just after launch and for emergencies if the spacecraft had lost attitude control.

''New Horizons'' recorded scientific instrument data to its solid-state memory buffer at each encounter, then transmitted the data to Earth. Data storage is done on two low-power [[Flash memory|solid-state recorders]] (one primary, one backup) holding up to {{val|8|ul=gigabyte}}s each. Because of the extreme distance from Pluto and the Kuiper belt, only one buffer load at those encounters can be saved. This is because ''New Horizons'' would require approximately 16 months after leaving the vicinity of Pluto to transmit the buffer load back to Earth.&lt;ref name="JHU APL News Center 20150414"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20150414 |title=NASA's New Horizons Nears Historic Encounter with Pluto |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory |first1=Dwayne |last1=Brown |first2=Michael |last2=Buckley |first3=Maria |last3=Stothoff |date=April 14, 2015 |accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Pluto's distance, radio signals from the space probe back to Earth took four hours and 25 minutes to traverse 4.7&amp;nbsp;billion km of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-33531811 |title=New Horizons: Spacecraft survives Pluto encounter |publisher=BBC |last1=Rincon |first1=Paul |date=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the reason for the delay between the gathering of and transmission of data is that all of the ''New Horizons'' instrumentation is body-mounted. In order for the cameras to record data, the entire probe must turn, and the one-degree-wide beam of the high-gain antenna was not pointing toward Earth.  Previous spacecraft, such as the ''Voyager'' program probes, had a rotatable instrumentation platform (a "scan platform") that could take measurements from virtually any angle without losing radio contact with Earth.  ''New Horizons'' was mechanically simplified to save weight, shorten the schedule, and improve reliability during its 15-year lifetime.

The ''[[Voyager 2]]'' scan platform jammed at Saturn, and the demands of long time exposures at outer planets led to a change of plans such that the entire probe was rotated to make photos at Uranus and Neptune, similar to how ''New Horizons'' rotated.

=== Science payload ===
''New Horizons'' carries seven instruments: three optical instruments, two plasma instruments, a dust sensor and a radio science receiver/radiometer. The instruments are to be used to investigate the global geology, surface composition, surface temperature, atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature and escape rate of Pluto and its moons. The rated power is {{val|21|u=watts}}, though not all instruments operate simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Y. Guo |author2=R. W.

==== Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) ====
[[File:New Horizons LORRI.jpg|thumb|LORRI—long-range camera]]
{{main|Long Range Reconnaissance Imager}}
The Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) is a long-focal-length imager designed for high resolution and responsivity at visible wavelengths. The instrument is equipped with a 1024×1024 pixel by 12-bits-per-pixel monochromatic [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] imager giving a resolution of 5{{space}}[[microradian|μrad]] (~1{{space}}[[arcsecond|arcsec]]).&lt;ref name=jhuapl-lorri&gt;{{cite web |title=About LORRI Images |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/soc/lorri_about.html |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University - Applied Physics Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCD is chilled far below freezing by a passive radiator on the antisolar face of the spacecraft. This temperature differential requires insulation, and isolation from the rest of the structure. The {{cvt|208.3|mm|in}} aperture [[Ritchey-Chrétien telescope|Ritchey–Chretien]] mirrors and metering structure are made of [[silicon carbide]], to boost stiffness, reduce weight, and prevent warping at low temperatures. The optical elements sit in a composite light shield, and mount with titanium and fiberglass for thermal isolation. Overall mass is {{cvt|8.6|kg}}, with the optical tube assembly (OTA) weighing about {{cvt|5.6|kg}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boulder.swri.edu/pkb/ssr/ssr-lorri.pdf |title=Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager on New Horizons |first=A.

==== Alice ====
{{main|Alice (spacecraft instrument)}}
''Alice'' is an [[ultraviolet]] imaging [[spectrometer]] that is one of two photographic instruments comprising ''New Horizons''{{'}} Pluto Exploration Remote Sensing Investigation (PERSI); the other being the ''Ralph'' telescope. It resolves 1,024{{space}}wavelength bands in the far and extreme ultraviolet (from 50–{{val|180|ul=nm}}), over 32{{space}}view fields. Its goal is to determine the composition of Pluto's atmosphere. This Alice instrument is derived from another Alice aboard [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s [[Rosetta space probe#Nucleus|Rosetta]] spacecraft.&lt;ref name="ProbeHomepage" /&gt;

The ''Ralph'' telescope,  75 mm&lt;reF&gt;[http://www.boulder.swri.edu/pkb/ssr/ssr-ralph.pdf]&lt;/reF&gt; in aperture, is one of two photographic instruments that make up ''New Horizons''{{'}} Pluto Exploration Remote Sensing Investigation (PERSI), with the other being the Alice instrument. ''Ralph'' has two separate channels: MVIC (Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera), a visible-light [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] imager with broadband and color channels; and LEISA (Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array), a near-[[infrared]] imaging spectrometer. LEISA is derived from a similar instrument on the [[Earth Observing-1]] spacecraft. ''Ralph'' was named after Alice's husband on ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', and was designed after Alice.&lt;ref name="sn20150711"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spacenews.com/new-horizons-about-to-bring-an-unknown-world-into-sharp-focus/ |title=Meet Ralph, the New Horizons Camera Bringing Pluto into Sharp Focus |work=Space News |last1=David |first1=Leonard |date=July 11, 2015 |accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 2017, NASA announced that it has renamed the LEISA instrument to the "Lisa Hardaway Infrared Mapping Spectrometer" in honor of [[Lisa Hardaway]], the ''Ralph'' program manager at [[Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies|Ball Aerospace]], who died in January 2017 at age 50.&lt;ref name="nasa20170623"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-new-horizons-mission-honors-memory-of-engineer-lisa-hardaway |title=NASA's New Horizons Mission Honors Memory of Engineer Lisa Hardaway |publisher=NASA |editor-first=Lillian |editor-last=Gipson |date=June 23, 2017 |accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter (VBSDC) ====
[[File:New Horizons sdc.jpeg|thumb|VBSDC—Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter]]

The [[Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter]] (VBSDC), built by students at the University of Colorado Boulder, is operating periodically to make [[Cosmic dust|dust]] measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pluto-Bound, Student-Built Dust Detector Renamed "Venetia," Honoring Girl Who Named Ninth Planet |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=062906 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmannedspaceflight.com/index.php?act=attach&amp;type=post&amp;id=21744]&lt;/reF&gt; It consists of a detector panel, about {{cvt|18|x|12|in|mm|order=flip}}, mounted on the anti-solar face of the spacecraft (the ram direction), and an electronics box within the spacecraft. The detector contains fourteen [[polyvinylidene difluoride]] (PVDF) panels, twelve science and two reference, which generate voltage when impacted. Effective collecting area is {{cvt|0.125|m2}}. No dust counter has operated past the orbit of [[Uranus]]; models of dust in the outer Solar System, especially the Kuiper belt, are speculative. The VBSDC is always turned on measuring the masses of the interplanetary and interstellar dust particles (in the range of nano- and picograms) as they collide with the PVDF panels mounted on the ''New Horizons'' spacecraft. The measured data is expected to greatly contribute to the understanding of the dust spectra of the Solar System. The dust spectra can then be compared with those from observations of other stars, giving new clues as to where Earth-like planets can be found in the universe. The dust counter is named for [[Venetia Burney]], who first suggested the name "Pluto" at the age of 11. A thirteen-minute short film about the VBSDC garnered an Emmy Award for student achievement in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nes3cAh8_DI |title=Destination: Pluto and Beyond |work=YouTube.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x3s3be1g?url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nes3cAh8_DI |archivedate=March 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In-flight tests and Mars orbit ====
During the week of February 20, 2006, controllers conducted initial in-flight tests of three onboard science instruments, the Alice ultraviolet imaging spectrometer, the PEPSSI plasma-sensor, and the LORRI long-range visible-spectrum camera. No scientific measurements or images were taken, but instrument electronics, and in the case of Alice, some electromechanical systems were shown to be functioning correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stern, Alan |date=February 27, 2006 |title=Boulder and Baltimore |work=The PI's Perspective |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/overview/piPerspectives/piPerspective_2_27_2006.php |publisher=Johns Hopkins APL |accessdate=June 11, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x3rv6OyU?url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/overview/piPerspectives/piPerspective_2_27_2006.php |archivedate=March 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the need to conserve fuel for possible encounters with Kuiper belt objects subsequent to the Pluto flyby, intentional encounters with objects in the [[asteroid belt]] were not planned. After launch, the ''New Horizons'' team scanned the spacecraft's trajectory to determine if any asteroids would, by chance, be close enough for observation. In May 2006 it was discovered that ''New Horizons'' would pass close to the tiny asteroid [[132524 APL]] on June 13, 2006. Closest approach occurred at 4:05&amp;nbsp;UTC at a distance of {{cvt|101,867|km|mi}}. The asteroid was imaged by ''Ralph'' (use of LORRI was not possible because of proximity to the Sun), which gave the team a chance to test ''Ralph''{{'s}} capabilities, and make observations of the asteroid's composition as well as light and phase curves. The asteroid was estimated to be {{cvt|2.5|km|mi}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stern, Alan |date=June 1, 2006 |title=A Summer's Crossing of the Asteroid Belt |series=The PI's Perspective |publisher=Johns Hopkins APL |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/overview/piPerspective.php?page=piPerspective_6_1_2006 |accessdate=June 20, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x3s3l3BI?url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/overview/piPerspective.php?page=piPerspective_6_1_2006 |archivedate=March 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=JF56 Encounter, Encounter Date June 13, 2006 UT |work=Pluto New Horizons Mission, Supporting Observations for 2002 |publisher=International Astronomical Union |url=http://smass.mit.edu/2002jf56.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805184931/http://smass.mit.edu/2002jf56.html |archivedate=August 5, 2007 |accessdate=June 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JHAPL61506"&gt;{{cite web |title=New Horizons Tracks an Asteroid |publisher=Johns Hopkins APL |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/061506.php |date=June 15, 2006 |accessdate=June 20, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x3s42XaX?url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/061506.php |archivedate=March 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft successfully tracked the rapidly moving asteroid over June 10–12, 2006.

==== First Pluto sighting ====
The first images of Pluto from ''New Horizons'' were acquired September 21–24, 2006, during a test of LORRI. They were released on November 28, 2006.&lt;ref name="LORRI"&gt;{{cite web |author=K.

=== Jupiter encounter ===
{{Main article|Exploration of Jupiter}}
[[File:NH Jupiter IR (contrast enhanced).jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Infrared image of Jupiter by ''New Horizons'']]
''New Horizons'' used LORRI to take its first photographs of Jupiter on September 4, 2006, from a distance of {{convert|291|e6km|abbr=off|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/092606.html |title=Jupiter Ahoy! |publisher=Johns Hopkins APL |date=September 26, 2006 |accessdate=October 27, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x3rxJi16?url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/092606.html |archivedate=March 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; More detailed exploration of the system began in January 2007 with an infrared image of the moon [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], as well as several black-and-white images of Jupiter itself.&lt;ref name=jupiter-encounter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/011007.php |title=Jupiter Encounter Begins |publisher=Johns Hopkins APL |date= |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113224807/http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/011007.php |archivedate=November 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New Horizons'' received a gravity assist from Jupiter, with its closest approach at 05:43:40&amp;nbsp;UTC on February 28, 2007, when it was {{convert|2.3|e6km|abbr=off|sp=us}} from Jupiter. The flyby increased ''New Horizons''{{'}} speed by {{cvt|4|km/s|km/h mph|-3}}, accelerating the probe to a velocity of {{cvt|23|km/s|km/h mph|-3}} relative to the Sun and shortening its voyage to Pluto by three years.&lt;ref name=boost&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/022807.php |title=Pluto-Bound New Horizons Spacecraft Gets a Boost from Jupiter |publisher=Johns Hopkins APL |date=February 28, 2007 |accessdate=December 17, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113224828/http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/022807.php |archivedate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flyby was the center of a four-month intensive observation campaign lasting from January to June. Being an ever-changing scientific target, Jupiter has been observed intermittently since the end of the ''Galileo'' mission in September 2003. Knowledge about Jupiter benefited from the fact that ''New Horizons''{{'}} instruments were built using the latest technology, especially in the area of cameras, representing a significant improvement over ''Galileo''{{'s}} cameras, which were modified versions of ''Voyager'' cameras, which, in turn, were modified ''Mariner'' cameras. The Jupiter encounter also served as a shakedown and dress rehearsal for the Pluto encounter. Because Jupiter is much closer to Earth than Pluto, the communications link can transmit multiple loadings of the memory buffer; thus the mission returned more data from the Jovian system than it was expected to transmit from Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17381933/ |title=Pluto probe gets an eyeful in Jupiter flyby |work=MSNBC |first=Tariq |last=Malik |date=February 28, 2007 |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x3ryMYjH?url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17381933/ |archivedate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main goals during the Jupiter encounter was observing its [[Atmosphere of Jupiter|atmospheric conditions]] and analyzing the structure and composition of its clouds. Heat-induced lightning strikes in the polar regions and "waves" that indicate violent storm activity were observed and measured. The [[Atmosphere of Jupiter#Oval BA|Little Red Spot]], spanning up to 70% of Earth's diameter, was imaged from up close for the first time.&lt;ref name=boost/&gt; Recording from different angles and illumination conditions, ''New Horizons'' took detailed images of Jupiter's faint [[Rings of Jupiter|ring system]], discovering debris left over from recent collisions within the rings or from other unexplained phenomena. The search for undiscovered moons within the rings showed no results. Travelling through Jupiter's [[Magnetosphere of Jupiter|magnetosphere]], ''New Horizons'' collected valuable particle readings.&lt;ref name=boost/&gt; "Bubbles" of plasma that are thought to be formed from material ejected by the moon Io, were noticed in the [[Magnetosphere#Magnetotail|magnetotail]].&lt;ref name=surf&gt;{{cite news |last=Than |first=Ker |date=October 9, 2007 |title=Spacecraft Surfs Jupiter's Magnetic Tail |url=http://www.space.com/4446-spacecraft-surfs-jupiter-magnetic-tail.html |newspaper=Space.com |publisher= |accessdate=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jovian moons ====
The four largest moons of Jupiter were in poor positions for observation; the necessary path of the gravity-assist maneuver meant that ''New Horizons'' passed millions of kilometers from any of the [[Galilean moons]]. Still, its instruments were intended for small, dim targets, so they were scientifically useful on large, distant moons. Emphasis was put on Jupiter's innermost Galilean moon, [[Io (moon)|Io]], whose active volcanoes shoot out tons of material into Jupiter's magnetosphere, and further. Out of eleven observed eruptions, three were seen for the first time. That of [[Tvashtar Paterae|Tvashtar]] reached an altitude of up to {{cvt|330|km}}. The event gave scientists an unprecedented look into the structure and motion of the rising plume and its subsequent fall back to the surface. Infrared signatures of a further 36 volcanoes were noticed.&lt;ref name=boost/&gt; Callisto's surface was analyzed with LEISA, revealing how lighting and viewing conditions affect infrared spectrum readings of its surface water ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=4&amp;gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=21 |title=Capturing Callisto |publisher=Johns Hopkins APL |date= |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113224826/http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=4&amp;gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=21 |archivedate=November 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minor moons such as [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]] had their orbit solutions refined. The cameras determined their positions, acting as "reverse optical navigation".

=== Outer Solar System ===
After passing Jupiter, ''New Horizons'' spent most of its journey towards Pluto in hibernation mode: redundant components as well as guidance and control systems were shut down to extend their life cycle, decrease operation costs and free the [[Deep Space Network]] for other missions.&lt;ref name=hibernation1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/062807.php |title=New Horizons Slips into Electronic Slumber |publisher=Johns Hopkins APL |date=2007 |accessdate=December 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113224815/http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/062807.php |archivedate=November 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During hibernation mode, the onboard computer monitored the probe's systems and transmitted a signal back to Earth: a "green" code if everything was functioning as expected or a "red" code if mission control's assistance was needed.&lt;ref name=hibernation1/&gt; The probe was activated for about two months a year so that the instruments could be calibrated and the systems checked.

A study based on 18 months of computer simulations, Earth-based telescope observations and occultations of the Pluto system revealed that the possibility of a catastrophic collision with debris or dust was less than 0.3% on the probe's scheduled course.&lt;ref name=debris1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/20121016.php |title=At Pluto, Moons and Debris May Be Hazardous to New Horizons |publisher=Johns Hopkins APL |date=2012 |accessdate=December 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113224823/http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/20121016.php |archivedate=November 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=debris2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/20130614.php |title=New Horizons Team Sticking to Original Flight Plan at Pluto |publisher=Johns Hopkins APL |date=2013 |accessdate=December 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113224851/http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/20130614.php |archivedate=November 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the hazard increased, ''New Horizons'' could have used one of two possible contingency plans, the so-called SHBOTs (Safe Haven by Other Trajectories): the probe could have continued on its present trajectory with the antenna facing the incoming particles so the more vital systems would be protected, or, it could have positioned its antenna to make a course correction that would take it just 3000&amp;nbsp;km from the surface of Pluto where it was expected that the [[atmospheric drag]] would clean the surrounding space of possible debris.&lt;ref name=debris2/&gt;

While in hibernation mode in July 2012, ''New Horizons'' started gathering scientific data with SWAP, PEPSSI and VBSDC. Although it was originally planned to activate just the VBSDC, other instruments were powered on the initiative of principal investigator Alan Stern who decided they could use the opportunity to collect valuable heliospheric data. Before activating the other two instruments, ground tests were conducted to make sure that the expanded data gathering in this phase of the mission would not limit available energy, memory and fuel in the future and that all systems are functioning during the flyby.&lt;ref name=new_instruments&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/20120709.php |title=New Horizons Doing Science in Its Sleep |publisher=Johns Hopkins APL |date=2012 |accessdate=December 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113224851/http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/20120709.php |archivedate=November 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first set of data was transmitted in January 2013 during a three-week activation from hibernation.

On February 12, 2015, NASA released new images of Pluto (taken from January 25 to 31) from the approaching probe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20150204 |title=Happy Birthday Clyde Tombaugh: New Horizons Returns New Images of Pluto |publisher=Applied Physics Laboratory |date=February 4, 2015 |accessdate=November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20150212 |title=The View from New Horizons: A Full Day on Pluto-Charon |publisher=Applied Physics Laboratory |date=February 12, 2015 |accessdate=November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New Horizons'' was more than {{convert|203|e6km|mi|sp=us}} away from Pluto when it began taking the photos, which showed Pluto and its largest moon, Charon. The exposure time was too short to see Pluto's smaller, much fainter, moons.

Investigators compiled a series of images of the moons Nix and Hydra taken from January 27 through February 8, 2015, beginning at a range of {{convert|201|e6km|mi|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20150218 |title=85 Years after Pluto's Discovery, New Horizons Spots Small Moons Orbiting Pluto |publisher=Applied Physics Laboratory |date=February 18, 2015 |accessdate=November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pluto and Charon appear as a single overexposed object at the center.

Also in regards to the approach phase during January 2015, on August 21, 2012, the team announced that they would spend mission time attempting long-range observations of the Kuiper belt object temporarily designated [[VNH0004]] (now designated {{mpl|2011 KW|48}}), when the object was at a distance from ''New Horizons'' of {{convert|75|Gm|AU|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="vnh"/&gt; The object would be too distant to resolve surface features or take spectroscopy, but it would be able to make observations that cannot be made from Earth, namely a [[phase curve (astronomy)|phase curve]] and a search for small moons. A second object was planned to be observed in June 2015, and a third in September after the flyby; the team hoped to observe a dozen such objects through 2018.&lt;ref name="vnh"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.americaspace.com/?p=24691 |title=New Horizons to Encounter KBO Ahead of Pluto Flyby |website=Americaspace.com |date=2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 15, 2015, Pluto was imaged showing a possible polar cap.&lt;ref name="NASA-20150429"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Dwayne |last2=Buckley |first2=Michael |title=NASA's New Horizons Detects Surface Features, Possible Polar Cap on Pluto |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-new-horizons-detects-surface-features-possible-polar-cap-on-pluto |date=April 29, 2015 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Software glitch ====
On July 4, 2015, ''New Horizons'' experienced a software anomaly and went into safe mode, preventing the spacecraft from performing scientific observations until engineers could resolve the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gipson |first1=Lillian |title=New Horizons Team Responds to Spacecraft Anomaly |url=http://www.nasa.gov/nh/new-horizons-responds-spacecraft-anomaly |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=July 4, 2015 |accessdate=July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Klotz, Irene |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/05/us-space-pluto-idUSKCN0PF0HW20150705 |title=New Horizons space probe suffers glitch on approach to Pluto |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=July 5, 2015|newspaper=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 5, NASA announced that the problem was determined to be a timing flaw in a command sequence used to prepare the spacecraft for its flyby, and the spacecraft would resume scheduled science operations on July 7. The science observations lost because of the anomaly were judged to have no impact on the mission's main objectives and minimal impact on other objectives.&lt;ref name="NASA-new-horizons-2015-07-05"&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA's New Horizons Plans July 7 Return to Normal Science Operations |url=http://www.nasa.gov/nh/new-horizons-plans-july-7-return-to-normal-science-operations |website=NASA.gov |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The timing flaw consisted of performing two tasks simultaneously—compressing previously acquired data to release space for more data, and making a second copy of the approach command sequence—that together overloaded the spacecraft's primary computer. After the overload was detected, the spacecraft performed as designed: it switched from the primary computer to the backup computer, entered safe mode, and sent a distress call back to Earth. The distress call was received the afternoon of July 4, which alerted engineers that they needed to contact the spacecraft to get more information and resolve the issue. The resolution was that the problem happened as part of preparations for the approach, and was not expected to happen again because no similar tasks were planned for the remainder of the encounter.&lt;ref name="NASA-new-horizons-2015-07-05"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Feltman |first=Rachel |title=New Horizons computer overload won't hurt the mission to Pluto, NASA says |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/07/06/after-a-heart-stopping-glitch-nasas-new-horizons-prepares-for-its-historic-pluto-flyby/ |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pluto system encounter ==
[[File:Alan Stern and New Horizons Team Celebrate Pluto Flyby.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alan Stern]] and the ''New Horizons'' team celebrate after the spacecraft successfully completed its flyby of Pluto.]]
The closest approach of the ''New Horizons'' spacecraft to Pluto occurred at 11:49&amp;nbsp;UTC on July 14, 2015 at a range of {{convert|12472|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the surface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA's Three-Billion-Mile Journey to Pluto Reaches Historic Encounter |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20150714-2 |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory]] |date=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{convert|13658|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the center of Pluto.

=== Objectives ===
The mission's science objectives are grouped in three distinct priorities. The "primary objectives" are required; the "secondary objectives" are expected to be met but are not demanded. The "tertiary objectives" are desired. These objectives may be attempted, though they may be skipped in favor of the above objectives. An objective to measure any magnetic field of Pluto was dropped. A [[magnetometer]] instrument could not be implemented within a reasonable mass budget and schedule, and [[#Science payload|SWAP and PEPSSI]] could do an indirect job detecting some magnetic field around Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first1=Barrie W. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nKZnNnWjE0C&amp;pg=PA189 |title=Pluto: Sentinel of the Outer Solar System |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |page=189 |isbn=9781139490221 |accessdate=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''New Horizons'' passed within {{cvt|12500|km|mi}} of Pluto, with this closest approach on July 14, 2015 at 11:50&amp;nbsp;UTC. ''New Horizons'' had a relative velocity of {{cvt|13.78|km/s|km/h mph}} at its closest approach, and came as close as {{cvt|28800|km|mi}} to Charon. Starting 3.2 days before the closest approach, long-range imaging included the mapping of Pluto and Charon to {{cvt|40|km|mi}} resolution. This is half the rotation period of the Pluto–Charon system and allowed imaging of all sides of both bodies. Close range imaging was repeated twice per day in order to search for surface changes caused by localized snow fall or surface [[cryovolcanism]]. Because of Pluto's tilt, a portion of the northern hemisphere would be in shadow at all times. During the flyby, engineers expected LORRI to be able to obtain select images with resolution as high as {{cvt|50|m|ft|disp=x| per pixel (|/px)}} if closest distance were around 12,500&amp;nbsp;km, and MVIC was expected to obtain four-color global dayside maps at {{cvt|1.6|km|mi|0}} resolution. LORRI and MVIC attempted to overlap their respective coverage areas to form stereo pairs. LEISA obtained hyperspectral near-infrared maps at {{cvt|7|km|mi|disp=x|/px (|/px)}} globally and {{cvt|0.6|km|mi|disp=x|/px (|/px)}} for selected areas.

Meanwhile, Alice characterized the atmosphere, both by emissions of atmospheric molecules ([[airglow]]), and by dimming of background stars as they pass behind Pluto ([[occultation]]). During and after closest approach, SWAP and PEPSSI sampled the high atmosphere and its effects on the solar wind. VBSDC searched for dust, inferring meteoroid collision rates and any invisible rings. REX performed active and passive radio science. The communications dish on Earth measured the disappearance and reappearance of the [[radio occultation]] signal as the probe flew by behind Pluto. The results resolved Pluto's diameter (by their timing) and atmospheric density and composition (by their weakening and strengthening pattern). (Alice can perform similar occultations, using sunlight instead of radio beacons.) Previous missions had the spacecraft transmit through the atmosphere, to Earth ("downlink"). Pluto's mass and mass distribution were evaluated by the gravitational tug on the spacecraft. As the spacecraft speeds up and slows down, the radio signal exhibited a [[Doppler shift]]. The Doppler shift was measured by comparison with the ultrastable oscillator in the communications electronics.

Reflected sunlight from Charon allowed some imaging observations of the nightside. Backlighting by the Sun gave an opportunity to highlight any rings or atmospheric hazes. REX performed radiometry of the nightside.

=== Satellite observations ===
''New Horizons''{{'}} best spatial resolution of the small satellites is {{cvt|330|m|ft|disp=x| per pixel (|/px)}} at Nix, {{cvt|780|m|ft|disp=x|/px (|/px)}} at Hydra, and approximately {{cvt|1.8|km|mi|disp=x|/px (|/px)}} at Kerberos and Styx. Estimates for the diameters of these bodies are: Nix at {{cvt|54|xx|41|xx|36|km|mi}}; Hydra at {{cvt|43|xx|33|km|mi}}; Kerberos at {{cvt|12|xx|4.5|km|mi}}; and Styx at {{cvt|7|xx|5|km|mi}}. This translates to a resolution of 164/124/109, 55/42/?, 7/3/?, and 4/3/? pixels in width for Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx, respectively.

Initial predictions envisioned Kerberos as a relatively large and massive object whose dark surface led to it having a faint reflection. This proved to be wrong as images obtained by ''New Horizons'' on July 14 and sent back to Earth in October 2015 revealed an object just {{cvt|8|km|mi}} across with a highly reflective surface suggesting the presence of relatively clean water ice.&lt;ref name=kerberos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2015/10/last-of-plutos-moons--mysterious-kerberos--revealed-by-new-horizons |title=Last of Pluto's moons – mysterious Kerberos – revealed by New Horizons |work=[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy.com]] |date=October 23, 2015 |access-date=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kuiper belt object mission ===

==== Target background ====
Mission planners searched for one or more additional Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) of the order of {{cvt|50|–|100|km|mi}} in diameter as targets for flybys similar to the spacecraft's Plutonian encounter, but, despite the large population of KBOs, many factors limit the number of possible targets. Because the flight path is determined by the Pluto flyby, and the probe only has 33 kilograms of [[hydrazine]] remaining, the object to be visited needs to be within a cone, extending from Pluto, of less than a degree's width. This ruled out any possibility for a flyby of [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], a trans-Neptunian object comparable in size to Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universetoday.com/78334/video-stellar-occultation-by-eris/#more-78334 |title=Stellar Occultation by Eris |work=Universe Today |first=Nancy |last=Atkinson |date=November 11, 2010 |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x3rzqSik?url=http://www.universetoday.com/78334/video-stellar-occultation-by-eris/#more-78334 |archivedate=March 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It will also need to be within 55{{space}}AU, because beyond 55{{space}}AU, the communications link will become too weak, and the RTG power output will have decayed significantly enough to hinder observations. Desirable KBOs would be well over {{cvt|50|km|-1}} in diameter, neutral in color (to compare with the reddish Pluto), and, if possible, have a moon that imparts a wobble. After a search along ''New Horizon''{{'s}} flight path using the Hubble Space Telescope, only three KBOs were found in range, and one of those objects was later dropped from consideration.&lt;ref name=Extended&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacenews.com/extended-timetable-for-decision-on-new-horizons-extended-mission/ |title=Extended Timetable for Decision on New Horizons Extended Mission |work=Space News |last1=Foust |first1=Jeff |date=July 22, 2015 |accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Search ====
In 2011 a dedicated search for suitable KBOs using ground telescopes was started by mission scientists. Large ground telescopes with wide-field cameras, notably the twin 6.5-meter [[Magellan Telescopes]] in Chile, the 8.2-meter [[Subaru Telescope|Subaru Observatory]] in Hawaii, and the [[Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope]]&lt;ref name=parker2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pluto-bound probe faces crisis"&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/pluto-bound-probe-faces-crisis-1.15261 Pluto-bound probe faces crisis] (nature.com May 20, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; were used to search for potential targets.

*Mapping the surface geology to learn how it formed and has evolved
*Measuring the surface temperature
*Mapping the 3D surface topography and surface composition to learn how it is similar to and different from comets like [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko|67P]] and dwarf planets such as Pluto
*Searching for any signs of activity, such as a cloud-like coma
*Searching for, and studying, any satellites or rings
*Measuring or constraining the mass

=== Targeting maneuvers ===
{{mp|2014 MU|69}} is the first object to be targeted for a flyby that was discovered after the spacecraft was launched.&lt;ref name="Lakdawalla20150901"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2015/09011608-new-horizons-extended-mission-pt1.html |title=New Horizons extended mission target selected |publisher=[[The Planetary Society]] |last=Lakdawalla |first=Emily |authorlink=Emily Lakdawalla |date=September 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New Horizons'' is planned to come within {{convert|3500|km|mi|abbr=on}} of {{mp|2014 MU|69}}, three times closer than the spacecraft's earlier encounter with Pluto.

=== Core phase ===
The Core phase begins a week before the encounter, and continues for two days after the encounter. The majority of the science data will be collected within 48 hours of the closest approach in a phase called the Inner Core.&lt;ref name="Planetary"/&gt; Closest approach will occur January 1, 2019, at 05:33&amp;nbsp;[[UTC]],&lt;ref name="sfnow20180106"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/01/06/plot-thickens-as-new-horizons-moves-within-year-of-next-flyby/ |title=Plot thickens as New Horizons moves within year of next flyby |work=Spaceflight Now |first=Stephen |last=Clark |date=January 6, 2018 |accessdate=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at which point it will be {{val|43.4|ul=AU}} from the [[Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20151023 |title=Maneuver Moves New Horizons Spacecraft toward Next Potential Target |date=October 23, 2015 |accessdate=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this distance, the one-way transit time for radio signals between Earth and ''New Horizons'' will be 6 hours.&lt;ref name="2017 AGU"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Jim |title=New Horizons Explores the Kuiper Belt |journal=2017 American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting in New Orleans |date=December 12, 2017 |pages=12–15 |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/Press-Conferences/December-12-2017.php |accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data downlink ===
After the encounter, preliminary data will be sent to Earth on January 1 and 2, 2019, to transmit high priority data. On January 9, ''New Horizons'' will return to a spin-stabilized mode, to prepare to send the remainder of its data back to Earth.

== Speed ==
''New Horizons'' has been called "the fastest spacecraft ever launched"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/Resources/Press-Kits/011607_JupiterPressKit.pdf |title=New Horizons, The First Mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt: Exploring Frontier Worlds |publisher=[[Applied Physics Laboratory]] |type=Press Kit |date=January 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it left Earth at {{convert|16.26|km/s|km/h mph|0|sp=us}}, faster than any other spacecraft to date.&lt;ref name="sciam20130225"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/life-unbounded/the-fastest-spacecraft-ever/ |title=The Fastest Spacecraft Ever? |work=Scientific American |first=Caleb A. |last=Scharf |date=February 25, 2013 |accessdate=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ionine20150609"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/heres-why-the-new-horizons-spacecraft-wont-be-stopping-1710069685 |title=Here's Why The New Horizons Spacecraft Won't Be Stopping At Pluto |work=io9 |first=George |last=Dvorsky |date=June 9, 2015 |accessdate=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the first spacecraft launched directly into a solar escape trajectory, which requires an approximate speed while near Earth of {{cvt|16.5|km/s|km/h mph}},&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;To escape the Sun the spacecraft needs a speed relative to the Sun of the square root of 2 times the speed of the Earth (29.78&amp;nbsp;km/s), or 42.1&amp;nbsp;km/s. Relative to the Earth this is just 12.3&amp;nbsp;km/s. But the kinetic energy when near the surface of the Earth must include the energy to exit the gravity well of the Earth, which requires a speed of about 11 km/s. The total speed needed is the square root of the sum of the squares of these two speeds.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus additional [[delta-v]] to cover [[air drag|air]] and [[gravity drag]], all to be provided by the launch vehicle.

However, it is not the fastest spacecraft to leave the Solar System. {{as of|2018|01}}, this record is held by ''Voyager 1'', traveling at {{cvt|16.985|km/s|km/h mph|0}} relative to the Sun.&lt;ref name="heavens-escaping" /&gt; ''Voyager 1'' attained greater [[hyperbolic excess velocity]] than ''New Horizons'' thanks to [[gravity assist]]s by Jupiter and Saturn.  When ''New Horizons'' reaches the distance of {{val|100|ul=AU}}, it will be travelling at about {{cvt|13|km/s|km/h mph}}, around {{cvt|4|km/s|km/h mph}} slower than ''Voyager 1'' at that distance.&lt;ref name="jhuapl2006" /&gt; Other spacecraft, such as the [[Helios (spacecraft)|''Helios'' probes]], can also be measured as the fastest objects, because of their [[orbital speed]] relative to the Sun at [[Apsis|perihelion]]: {{cvt|68.7|km/s|km/h mph}} for ''Helios-B''. Because they remain in solar orbit, their [[specific orbital energy]] relative to the Sun is lower than ''New Horizons'' and other [[List of artificial objects escaping from the Solar System|artificial objects escaping the Solar System]].

''New Horizons''{{'}} [[Star 48]]B third stage is also on a [[hyperbolic trajectory|hyperbolic escape trajectory]] from the Solar System, and reached Jupiter before the ''New Horizons'' spacecraft.

'''Newton's law of universal gravitation''' states that every [[particle]] attracts every other particle in the universe with a [[force]] which is [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Direct proportionality|directly proportional]] to the product of their masses and [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the square of the distance between their centers.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;It was shown separately that large, spherically symmetrical masses attract and are attracted [[Shell theorem|as if all their mass were concentrated at their centers]].&lt;/ref&gt; This is a general [[physical law]] derived from [[empirical observation]]s by what [[Isaac Newton]] called [[inductive reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton: "In [experimental] philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena and afterwards rendered general by induction": "[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]", Book 3, General Scholium, at p.392 in Volume 2 of Andrew Motte's English translation published 1729.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a part of [[classical mechanics]] and was formulated in Newton's work ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' ("the ''Principia''"), first published on 5 July 1686. When Newton's book was presented in 1686 to the [[Royal Society]], [[Robert Hooke]] made a claim that Newton had obtained the inverse square law from him.

In today's language, the law states that every [[Point particle|point]] [[mass]] attracts every other point mass by a [[force]] acting along the [[Line (mathematics)|line]] intersecting the two points. The force is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[Product (mathematics)|product]] of the two masses, and inversely proportional to the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of the distance between them.&lt;ref name="Newton1"/&gt;

The equation for universal gravitation thus takes the form:
:&lt;math&gt;F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\ &lt;/math&gt;
where ''F'' is the gravitational force acting between two objects, ''m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the masses of the objects, ''r'' is the distance between the [[Center of mass|centers of their masses]], and ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].

The first test of Newton's theory of gravitation between masses in the laboratory was the [[Cavendish experiment]] conducted by the [[United Kingdom|British]] scientist [[Henry Cavendish]] in 1798.&lt;ref name="The Michell-Cavendish Experiment"&gt;[http://www.public.iastate.edu/~lhodges/Michell.htm The Michell-Cavendish Experiment], Laurent Hodges&lt;/ref&gt; It took place 111 years after the publication of Newton's ''Principia'' and approximately 71 years after his death.

Newton's law of [[gravity|gravitation]] resembles [[Coulomb's law]] of electrical forces, which is used to calculate the magnitude of the electrical force arising between two charged bodies. Both are [[inverse-square law]]s, where force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the bodies. Coulomb's law has the product of two charges in place of the product of the masses, and the [[electrostatic constant]] in place of the gravitational constant.

Newton's law has since been superseded by [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]], but it continues to be used as an excellent approximation of the effects of gravity in most applications. Relativity is required only when there is a need for extreme precision, or when dealing with very strong gravitational fields, such as those found near extremely massive and dense objects, or at very close distances (such as [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit around the Sun).

==History==
{{See also|History of gravitational theory}}
===Early history===
The relation of the distance of objects in [[free fall]] to the square of the time taken had recently been confirmed by [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Grimaldi]] and [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli|Riccioli]] between 1640 and 1650. They had also made a calculation of the [[gravitational constant]] by recording the oscillations of a pendulum.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Heilbron, ''Electricity in the 17th and 18th Centuries: A Study of Early Modern Physics'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979), 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern assessment about the early history of the inverse square law is that "by the late 1670s", the assumption of an "inverse proportion between gravity and the square of distance was rather common and had been advanced by a number of different people for different reasons".&lt;!-- specifically by Ofer Gal; need to break out sources if this is the right citation--&gt;&lt;ref name=ofer&gt;Discussion points can be seen for example in the following papers: N Guicciardini, "Reconsidering the Hooke-Newton debate on Gravitation: Recent Results", in Early Science and Medicine, 10 (2005), 511-517; Ofer Gal, "The Invention of Celestial Mechanics", in Early Science and Medicine, 10 (2005), 529-534; M Nauenberg, "Hooke's and Newton's Contributions to the Early Development of Orbital mechanics and Universal Gravitation", in Early Science and Medicine, 10 (2005), 518-528.&lt;/ref&gt; The same author credits [[Robert Hooke]] with a significant and seminal contribution, but treats Hooke's claim of priority on the inverse square point as irrelevant, as several individuals besides Newton and Hooke had suggested it. He points instead to the idea of "compounding the [[Celestial mechanics|celestial motions]]" and the conversion of Newton's thinking away from "[[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]]" and towards "[[Centripetal force|centripetal]]" force as Hooke's significant contributions.

Newton gave credit in his ''Principia'' to two people: [[Ismaël Bullialdus|Bullialdus]] (who wrote without proof that there was a force on the Earth towards the Sun), and [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli|Borelli]] (who wrote that all planets were attracted towards the Sun).&lt;ref name="Bullialdus 1645"&gt;Bullialdus (Ismael Bouillau) (1645), "Astronomia philolaica", Paris, 1645.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borelli, G. A. 1666"&gt;Borelli, G. A., "Theoricae Mediceorum Planetarum ex causis physicis deductae", Florence, 1666.&lt;/ref&gt; The main influence may have been Borelli, whose book Newton had a copy of.&lt;ref name="T Whiteside 1970 pages 5-19"&gt;D T Whiteside, "Before the Principia: the maturing of Newton's thoughts on dynamical astronomy, 1664-1684", Journal for the History of Astronomy, i (1970), pages 5-19; especially at page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hooke's work and claims===
Robert Hooke published his ideas about the "System of the World" in the 1660s, when he read to the [[Royal Society]] on March 21, 1666, a paper "concerning the inflection of a direct motion into a curve by a supervening attractive principle", and he published them again in somewhat developed form in 1674, as an addition to "An Attempt to Prove the Motion of the Earth from Observations".&lt;ref name="attempt"&gt;Hooke's 1674 statement in "An Attempt to Prove the Motion of the Earth from Observations" is available in [http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuView/ECHOzogiLib?mode=imagepath&amp;url=/mpiwg/online/permanent/library/XXTBUC3U/pageimg online facsimile here].&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke announced in 1674 that he planned to "explain a System of the World differing in many particulars from any yet known", based on three "Suppositions": that "all Celestial Bodies whatsoever, have an attraction or gravitating power towards their own Centers" and "they do also attract all the other Celestial Bodies that are within the sphere of their activity";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The First Professional Scientist: Robert Hooke and the Royal Society of London |first1=Robert D. |last1=Purrington |publisher=Springer |date=2009 |isbn=3-0346-0036-4 |page=168 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tJu97S3BtGIC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=tJu97S3BtGIC&amp;pg=PA168 Extract of page 168]
&lt;/ref&gt; that "all bodies whatsoever that are put into a direct and simple motion, will so continue to move forward in a straight line, till they are by some other effectual powers deflected and bent..."; and that "these attractive powers are so much the more powerful in operating, by how much the nearer the body wrought upon is to their own Centers". Thus Hooke clearly postulated mutual attractions between the Sun and planets, in a way that increased with nearness to the attracting body, together with a principle of linear inertia.

Hooke's statements up to 1674 made no mention, however, that an inverse square law applies or might apply to these attractions. Hooke's gravitation was also not yet universal, though it approached universality more closely than previous hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;See page 239 in Curtis Wilson (1989), "The Newtonian achievement in astronomy", ch.13 (pages 233-274) in "Planetary astronomy from the Renaissance to the rise of astrophysics: 2A: Tycho Brahe to Newton", CUP 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; He also did not provide accompanying evidence or mathematical demonstration. On the latter two aspects, Hooke himself stated in 1674: "Now what these several degrees [of attraction] are I have not yet experimentally verified"; and as to his whole proposal: "This I only hint at present", "having my self many other things in hand which I would first compleat, and therefore cannot so well attend it" (i.e. "prosecuting this Inquiry").&lt;ref name=attempt /&gt; It was later on, in writing on 6 January 1679|80&lt;ref&gt;[[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]]&lt;/ref&gt; to Newton, that Hooke communicated his "supposition ... that the Attraction always is in a duplicate proportion to the Distance from the Center Reciprocall, and Consequently that the Velocity will be in a subduplicate proportion to the Attraction and Consequently as [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] Supposes Reciprocall to the Distance."&lt;ref&gt;Page 309 in H W Turnbull (ed.), Correspondence of Isaac Newton, Vol 2 (1676-1687), (Cambridge University Press, 1960), document #239.&lt;/ref&gt; (The inference about the velocity was incorrect.)&lt;ref&gt;See Curtis Wilson (1989) at page 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooke's correspondence with Newton during 1679–1680 not only mentioned this inverse square supposition for the decline of attraction with increasing distance, but also, in Hooke's opening letter to Newton, of 24 November 1679, an approach of "compounding the celestial motions of the planets of a direct motion by the tangent &amp; an attractive motion towards the central body".&lt;ref&gt;Page 297 in H W Turnbull (ed.), Correspondence of Isaac Newton, Vol 2 (1676-1687), (Cambridge University Press, 1960), document #235, 24 November 1679.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newton's work and claims===
Newton, faced in May 1686 with Hooke's claim on the inverse square law, denied that Hooke was to be credited as author of the idea. Among the reasons, Newton recalled that the idea had been discussed with Sir Christopher Wren previous to Hooke's 1679 letter.&lt;ref&gt;Page 433 in H W Turnbull (ed.), Correspondence of Isaac Newton, Vol 2 (1676-1687), (Cambridge University Press, 1960), document #286, 27 May 1686.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also pointed out and acknowledged prior work of others,&lt;ref name="june1686"&gt;Pages 435-440 in H W Turnbull (ed.), Correspondence of Isaac Newton, Vol 2 (1676-1687), (Cambridge University Press, 1960), document #288, 20 June 1686.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Ismaël Bullialdus|Bullialdus]],&lt;ref name="Bullialdus 1645"/&gt; (who suggested, but without demonstration, that there was an attractive force from the Sun in the inverse square proportion to the distance), and [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli|Borelli]]&lt;ref name="Borelli, G. A. 1666"/&gt; (who suggested, also without demonstration, that there was a centrifugal tendency in counterbalance with a gravitational attraction towards the Sun so as to make the planets move in ellipses). D T Whiteside has described the contribution to Newton's thinking that came from Borelli's book, a copy of which was in Newton's library at his death.&lt;ref name="T Whiteside 1970 pages 5-19"/&gt;

Newton further defended his work by saying that had he first heard of the inverse square proportion from Hooke, he would still have some rights to it in view of his demonstrations of its accuracy. Hooke, without evidence in favor of the supposition, could only guess that the inverse square law was approximately valid at great distances from the center. According to Newton, while the 'Principia' was still at pre-publication stage, there were so many a-priori reasons to doubt the accuracy of the inverse-square law (especially close to an attracting sphere) that "without my (Newton's) Demonstrations, to which Mr Hooke is yet a stranger, it cannot believed by a judicious Philosopher to be any where accurate."&lt;ref&gt;Page 436, Correspondence, Vol.2, already cited.&lt;/ref&gt;

This remark refers among other things to Newton's finding, supported by mathematical demonstration, that if the inverse square law applies to tiny particles, then even a large spherically symmetrical mass also attracts masses external to its surface, even close up, exactly as if all its own mass were concentrated at its center. Thus Newton gave a justification, otherwise lacking, for applying the inverse square law to large spherical planetary masses as if they were tiny particles.&lt;ref&gt;Propositions 70 to 75 in Book 1, for example in the 1729 English translation of the ''Principia'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA263#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false start at page 263].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Newton had formulated, in Propositions 43-45 of Book 1&lt;ref&gt;Propositions 43 to 45 in Book 1, in the 1729 English translation of the ''Principia'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA177#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false start at page 177].&lt;/ref&gt; and associated sections of Book 3, a sensitive test of the accuracy of the inverse square law, in which he showed that only where the law of force is calculated as the inverse square of the distance will the directions of orientation of the planets' orbital ellipses stay constant as they are observed to do apart from small effects attributable to inter-planetary perturbations.

In regard to evidence that still survives of the earlier history, manuscripts written by Newton in the 1660s show that Newton himself had, by 1669, arrived at proofs that in a circular case of planetary motion, "endeavour to recede" (what was later called centrifugal force) had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center.&lt;ref&gt;D T Whiteside, "The pre-history of the 'Principia' from 1664 to 1686", Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London, 45 (1991), pages 11-61; especially at 13-20.&lt;/ref&gt; After his 1679-1680 correspondence with Hooke, Newton adopted the language of inward or centripetal force. According to Newton scholar J. Bruce Brackenridge, although much has been made of the change in language and difference of point of view, as between centrifugal or centripetal forces, the actual computations and proofs remained the same either way. They also involved the combination of tangential and radial displacements, which Newton was making in the 1660s. The lesson offered by Hooke to Newton here, although significant, was one of perspective and did not change the analysis.&lt;ref&gt;See J. Bruce Brackenridge, "The key to Newton's dynamics: the Kepler problem and the Principia", (University of California Press, 1995), especially at [https://books.google.com/books?id=ovOTK7X_mMkC&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false pages 20-21].&lt;/ref&gt; This background shows there was basis for Newton to deny deriving the inverse square law from Hooke.

===Newton's acknowledgment===
On the other hand, Newton did accept and acknowledge, in all editions of the ''Principia'', that Hooke (but not exclusively Hooke) had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system. Newton acknowledged Wren, Hooke and Halley in this connection in the Scholium to Proposition 4 in Book 1.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the 1729 English translation of the ''Principia'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false at page 66].&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also acknowledged to Halley that his correspondence with Hooke in 1679-80 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomical matters, but that did not mean, according to Newton, that Hooke had told Newton anything new or original: "yet am I not beholden to him for any light into that business but only for the diversion he gave me from my other studies to think on these things &amp; for his dogmaticalness in writing as if he had found the motion in the Ellipsis, which inclined me to try it ..."&lt;ref name="june1686"/&gt;

===Modern priority controversy===
Since the time of Newton and Hooke, scholarly discussion has also touched on the question of whether Hooke's 1679 mention of 'compounding the motions' provided Newton with something new and valuable, even though that was not a claim actually voiced by Hooke at the time. As described above, Newton's manuscripts of the 1660s do show him actually combining tangential motion with the effects of radially directed force or endeavour, for example in his derivation of the inverse square relation for the circular case. They also show Newton clearly expressing the concept of linear inertia—for which he was indebted to Descartes' work, published in 1644 (as Hooke probably was).&lt;ref name=dtw1970&gt;See page 10 in D T Whiteside, "Before the Principia: the maturing of Newton's thoughts on dynamical astronomy, 1664-1684", Journal for the History of Astronomy, i (1970), pages 5-19.&lt;/ref&gt; These matters do not appear to have been learned by Newton from Hooke.

Nevertheless, a number of authors have had more to say about what Newton gained from Hooke and some aspects remain controversial.&lt;ref name=ofer/&gt; The fact that most of Hooke's private papers had been destroyed or have disappeared does not help to establish the truth.

Newton's role in relation to the inverse square law was not as it has sometimes been represented. He did not claim to think it up as a bare idea. What Newton did was to show how the inverse-square law of attraction had many necessary mathematical connections with observable features of the motions of bodies in the solar system; and that they were related in such a way that the observational evidence and the mathematical demonstrations, taken together, gave reason to believe that the inverse square law was not just approximately true but exactly true (to the accuracy achievable in Newton's time and for about two centuries afterwards &amp;ndash; and with some loose ends of points that could not yet be certainly examined, where the implications of the theory had not yet been adequately identified or calculated).&lt;ref&gt;See for example the results of Propositions 43-45 and 70-75 in Book 1, cited above.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also G E Smith, in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/newton-principia/ "Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica"].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plagiarism dispute===
In 1686, when the first book of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' was presented to the [[Royal Society]], [[Robert Hooke]] accused Newton of [[plagiarism]] by claiming that he had taken from him the "notion" of "the rule of the decrease of Gravity, being reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the Center". At the same time (according to [[Edmond Halley]]'s contemporary report) Hooke agreed that "the Demonstration of the Curves generated thereby" was wholly Newton's.&lt;ref name="1686letters"&gt;H W Turnbull (ed.), Correspondence of Isaac Newton, Vol 2 (1676-1687), (Cambridge University Press, 1960), giving the Halley-Newton correspondence of May to July 1686 about Hooke's claims at pp.431-448, see particularly page 431.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way, the question arose as to what, if anything, Newton owed to Hooke. This is a subject extensively discussed since that time and on which some points, outlined below, continue to excite controversy.

About thirty years after Newton's death in 1727, [[Alexis Clairaut]], a mathematical astronomer eminent in his own right in the field of gravitational studies, wrote after reviewing what Hooke published, that "One must not think that this idea ... of Hooke diminishes Newton's glory"; and that "the example of Hooke" serves "to show what a distance there is between a truth that is glimpsed and a truth that is demonstrated".&lt;ref&gt;The second extract is quoted and translated in W.W. Rouse Ball, "An Essay on Newton's 'Principia'" (London and New York: Macmillan, 1893), at page 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The original statements by Clairaut (in French) are found (with orthography here as in the original) in "Explication abregée du systême du monde, et explication des principaux phénomenes astronomiques tirée des Principes de M. Newton" (1759), at Introduction (section IX), page 6: "Il ne faut pas croire que cette idée ... de Hook diminue la gloire de M. Newton", and "L'exemple de Hook" [serve] "à faire voir quelle distance il y a entre une vérité entrevue &amp; une vérité démontrée".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gravity Big G Measurements NIST.png|thumb|upright=2.0|Error plot showing experimental values for big G.]]

Assuming [[International System of Units|SI units]], ''F'' is measured in [[newton (units)|newton]]s (N), ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in [[kilogram]]s (kg), ''r'' in meters (m), and the constant ''G'' is approximately equal to {{val|6.674|e=-11|u=N m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; kg&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{CODATA2006|url=http://www.physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?bg}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The value of the constant ''G'' was first accurately determined from the results of the [[Cavendish experiment]] conducted by the [[United Kingdom|British]] scientist [[Henry Cavendish]] in 1798, although Cavendish did not himself calculate a numerical value for ''G''.&lt;ref name="The Michell-Cavendish Experiment"/&gt; This experiment was also the first test of Newton's theory of gravitation between masses in the laboratory. It took place 111 years after the publication of Newton's ''Principia'' and 71 years after Newton's death, so none of Newton's calculations could use the value of ''G''; instead he could only calculate a force relative to another force.

== Bodies with spatial extent ==
[[File:Earth-G-force.png|thumb|right|200px|Gravitational field strength within the Earth]]
[[File:Gravity field near earth.gif|thumb|Gravity field near the surface of the Earth – an object is shown accelerating toward the surface]]

If the bodies in question have spatial extent (as opposed to being point masses), then the gravitational force between them is calculated by summing the contributions of the notional point masses which constitute the bodies. In the limit, as the component point masses become "infinitely small", this entails [[integral|integrating]] the force (in vector form, see below) over the extents of the two [[Physical body|bodies]].

In this way, it can be shown that an object with a spherically-symmetric distribution of mass exerts the same gravitational attraction on external bodies as if all the object's mass were concentrated at a point at its centre.&lt;ref name=Newton1&gt;- Proposition 75, Theorem 35: p.956 - I.Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman, translators: [[Isaac Newton]], ''The Principia'': [[Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy]]. Preceded by ''A Guide to Newton's Principia'', by I.Bernard Cohen. University of California Press 1999 {{ISBN|0-520-08816-6}} {{ISBN|0-520-08817-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is not generally true for non-spherically-symmetrical bodies.)

For points ''inside'' a spherically-symmetric distribution of matter, Newton's [[Shell theorem]] can be used to find the gravitational force. The theorem tells us how different parts of the mass distribution affect the gravitational force measured at a point located a distance '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; from the center of the mass distribution:&lt;ref&gt;[http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/336k/lectures/node109.html Equilibrium State&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The portion of the mass that is located at radii r &lt; '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; causes the same force at '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as if all of the mass enclosed within a sphere of radius '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; was concentrated at the center of the mass distribution (as noted above).
* The portion of the mass that is located at radii r &gt; '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; exerts ''no net'' gravitational force at the distance '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; from the center. That is, the individual gravitational forces exerted by the elements of the sphere out there, on the point at '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, cancel each other out.

As a consequence, for example, within a shell of uniform thickness and density there is ''no net'' gravitational acceleration anywhere within the hollow sphere.

Furthermore, inside a uniform sphere the gravity increases linearly with the distance from the center; the increase due to the additional mass is 1.5 times the decrease due to the larger distance from the center. Thus, if a spherically symmetric body has a uniform core and a uniform mantle with a density that is less than 2/3 of that of the core, then the gravity initially decreases outwardly beyond the boundary, and if the sphere is large enough, further outward the gravity increases again, and eventually it exceeds the gravity at the core/mantle boundary. The gravity of the Earth may be highest at the core/mantle boundary.

== Vector form ==
[[File:Gravitymacroscopic.svg|thumb|200px|Gravity field surrounding Earth from a macroscopic perspective.]]

Newton's law of universal gravitation can be written as a [[vector (geometry)|vector]] [[equation]] to account for the direction of the gravitational force as well as its magnitude. In this formula, quantities in bold represent vectors.

: &lt;math&gt;

\mathbf{F}_{21} =
- G {m_1 m_2 \over {\vert \mathbf{r}_{12} \vert}^2}
\, \mathbf{\hat{r}}_{12}
&lt;/math&gt;
where
: '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; is the force applied on object 2 exerted by object 1,
: ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]],
: ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are respectively the masses of objects 1 and 2,
: |'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;| = |'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;| is the distance between objects 1 and 2, and
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat{r}}_{12} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{\mathbf{r}_2 - \mathbf{r}_1}{\vert\mathbf{r}_2 - \mathbf{r}_1\vert} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[unit vector]] from object 1 to 2.

It can be seen that the vector form of the equation is the same as the [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] form given earlier, except that '''F''' is now a vector quantity, and the right hand side is multiplied by the appropriate unit vector. Also, it can be seen that '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = −'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Gravitational field ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Center of mass]] --&gt;
{{main|Gravitational field}}

The '''gravitational field''' is a [[vector field]] that describes the gravitational force which would be applied on an object in any given point in space, per unit mass. It is actually equal to the [[gravitational acceleration]] at that point.

It is a generalisation of the vector form, which becomes particularly useful if more than 2 objects are involved (such as a rocket between the Earth and the Moon). For 2 objects (e.g. object 2 is a rocket, object 1 the Earth), we simply write '''r''' instead of '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m'' instead of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and define the gravitational field '''g'''('''r''') as:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf g(\mathbf r) =
- G {m_1 \over {{\vert \mathbf{r} \vert}^2}}
\, \mathbf{\hat{r}}
&lt;/math&gt;

so that we can write:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}( \mathbf r) = m \mathbf g(\mathbf r). &lt;/math&gt;

This formulation is dependent on the objects causing the field. The field has units of acceleration; in [[SI]], this is m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Gravitational fields are also [[Conservative field|conservative]]; that is, the work done by gravity from one position to another is path-independent. This has the consequence that there exists a gravitational potential field ''V''('''r''') such that
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{r}) = - \nabla V( \mathbf r).&lt;/math&gt;

If ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a point mass or the mass of a sphere with homogeneous mass distribution, the force field '''g'''('''r''') outside the sphere is isotropic, i.e., depends only on the distance ''r'' from the center of the sphere. In that case

: &lt;math&gt; V(r) = -G\frac{m_1}{r}. &lt;/math&gt;

the gravitational field is on, inside and outside of symmetric masses.

As per [[Gauss's law for gravity|Gauss Law]], field in a symmetric body can be found by the mathematical equation:

:{{oiint
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;\partial V&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g(r)}\cdot d\mathbf{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}},&lt;/math&gt;
}}

where &lt;math&gt;\partial V&lt;/math&gt; is a closed surface and &lt;math&gt;M_{\text{enc}}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass enclosed by the surface.

Hence, for a hollow sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and total mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{g(r)}| = \begin{cases}
  0, &amp; \mbox{if } r &lt; R \\

\\
  \dfrac{GM}{r^2}, &amp; \mbox{if } r \ge R

\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

For a uniform solid sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and total mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{g(r)}| = \begin{cases}
  \dfrac{GM r}{R^3}, &amp; \mbox{if } r &lt; R \\

\\
  \dfrac{GM}{r^2}, &amp; \mbox{if } r \ge R

\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Problematic aspects ==

Newton's description of gravity is sufficiently accurate for many practical purposes and is therefore widely used. Deviations from it are small when the dimensionless quantities ''φ''/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''(v/c)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' are both much less than one, where ''φ'' is the [[gravitational potential]], ''v'' is the velocity of the objects being studied, and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Misner | first = Charles W.

For example, Newtonian gravity provides an accurate description of the Earth/Sun system, since

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Phi}{c^2}=\frac{GM_\mathrm{sun}}{r_\mathrm{orbit}c^2} \sim 10^{-8},

\quad \left(\frac{v_\mathrm{Earth}}{c}\right)^2=\left(\frac{2\pi r_\mathrm{orbit}}{(1\ \mathrm{yr})c}\right)^2 \sim 10^{-8} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;orbit&lt;/sub&gt; is the radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun.

In situations where either dimensionless parameter is large, then
[[general relativity]] must be used to describe the system. General relativity reduces to Newtonian gravity in the limit of small potential and low velocities, so Newton's law of gravitation is often said to be the low-gravity limit of general relativity.

===Theoretical concerns with Newton's expression===
* There is no immediate prospect of identifying the mediator of gravity. Attempts by physicists to identify the relationship between the gravitational force and other known fundamental forces are not yet resolved, although considerable headway has been made over the last 50 years (See: [[Theory of everything]] and [[Standard Model]]). Newton himself felt that the concept of an inexplicable ''[[action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]]'' was unsatisfactory (see "[[#Newton's reservations|Newton's reservations]]" below), but that there was nothing more that he could do at the time.
* Newton's theory of gravitation requires that the gravitational force be transmitted instantaneously. Given the classical assumptions of the nature of space and time before the development of General Relativity, a significant propagation delay in gravity leads to unstable planetary and stellar orbits.

===Observations conflicting with Newton's formula===
*Newton's Theory does not fully explain the [[precession]] of the [[perihelion]] of the [[orbit]]s of the planets, especially of [[planet]] [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], which was detected long after the life of Newton.&lt;ref&gt;- [[Max Born]] (1924), ''Einstein's Theory of Relativity'' (The 1962 Dover edition, page 348 lists a table documenting the observed and calculated values for the precession of the perihelion of Mercury, Venus, and the Earth.)&lt;/ref&gt; There is a 43 [[arcsecond]] per century discrepancy between the Newtonian calculation, which arises only from the gravitational attractions from the other planets, and the observed precession, made with advanced telescopes during the 19th century.
*The predicted angular deflection of light rays by gravity that is calculated by using Newton's Theory is only one-half of the deflection that is actually observed by astronomers. Calculations using [[General relativity#Bending of light|General Relativity]] are in much closer agreement with the astronomical observations.
*In spiral galaxies, the orbiting of stars around their centers seems to strongly disobey Newton's law of universal gravitation. Astrophysicists, however, explain this spectacular phenomenon in the framework of Newton's laws, with the presence of large amounts of [[dark matter]].

===Newton's reservations===
While Newton was able to formulate his law of gravity in his monumental work, he was deeply uncomfortable with the notion of "action at a distance" that his equations implied. In 1692, in his third letter to Bentley, he wrote: ''"That one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum without the mediation of anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one another, is to me so great an absurdity that, I believe, no man who has in philosophic matters a competent faculty of thinking could ever fall into it."''

He never, in his words, "assigned the cause of this power". In all other cases, he used the phenomenon of motion to explain the origin of various forces acting on bodies, but in the case of gravity, he was unable to experimentally identify the motion that produces the force of gravity (although he invented two [[mechanical explanations of gravitation|mechanical hypotheses]] in 1675 and 1717). Moreover, he refused to even offer a hypothesis as to the cause of this force on grounds that to do so was contrary to sound science. He lamented that "philosophers have hitherto attempted the search of nature in vain" for the source of the gravitational force, as he was convinced "by many reasons" that there were "causes hitherto unknown" that were fundamental to all the "phenomena of nature". These fundamental phenomena are still under investigation and, though hypotheses abound, the definitive answer has yet to be found. And in Newton's 1713 ''[[General Scholium]]'' in the second edition of ''Principia'': ''"I have not yet been able to discover the cause of these properties of gravity from phenomena and I [[hypotheses non fingo|feign no hypotheses]].... It is enough that gravity does really exist and acts according to the laws I have explained, and that it abundantly serves to account for all the motions of celestial bodies."''&lt;ref&gt;- ''The Construction of Modern Science: Mechanisms and Mechanics'', by Richard S. Westfall. Cambridge University Press. 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

===Einstein's solution===
{{Spacetime|cTopic=Relation to gravity}}
These objections were explained by Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]], in which gravitation is an attribute of [[curved spacetime]] instead of being due to a force propagated between bodies. In Einstein's theory, energy and momentum distort spacetime in their vicinity, and other particles move in trajectories determined by the geometry of spacetime. This allowed a description of the motions of light and mass that was consistent with all available observations. In general relativity, the gravitational force is a [[fictitious force]] due to the [[curvature of spacetime]], because the [[gravitational acceleration]] of a body in [[free fall]] is due to its [[world line]] being a [[geodesic]] of [[spacetime]].

== Extensions ==

Newton was the first to consider in his Principia an extended expression of his law of gravity including an inverse-cube term of the form
:&lt;math&gt;F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} + B \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^3} \ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; a constant
attempting to explain the Moon's apsidal motion. Other extensions were proposed by Laplace (around 1790) and Decombes (1913):&lt;ref&gt;http://physicsessays.org/doi/abs/10.4006/1.3038751?journalCode=phes {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F(r) =k \frac {m_1 m_2}{r^2} \exp(-\alpha r)&lt;/math&gt; (Laplace)
:&lt;math&gt;F(r) = k \frac {m_1 m_2}{r^2} \left(1+ {\alpha \over {r^3}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; (Decombes)

In recent years, quests for non-inverse square terms in the law of gravity have been carried out by [[neutron interferometry]].&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.75.015501&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solutions of Newton's law of universal gravitation ==
{{main|n-body problem}}

The ''n''-body problem is an ancient, classical problem&lt;ref name="Leimanis and Minorsky"&gt;Leimanis and Minorsky: Our interest is with Leimanis, who first discusses some history about the ''n''-body problem, especially Ms. Kovalevskaya's ~1868-1888, twenty-year complex-variables approach, failure; '''Section 1: The Dynamics of Rigid Bodies and Mathematical Exterior Ballistics''' (Chapter 1, ''the motion of a rigid body about a fixed point'' ('''Euler''' and '''Poisson''' ''equations''); Chapter 2, ''Mathematical Exterior Ballistics''), good precursor background to the ''n''-body problem; '''Section 2: Celestial Mechanics''' (Chapter 1, ''The Uniformization of the Three-body Problem'' (Restricted Three-body Problem); Chapter 2, ''Capture in the Three-Body Problem''; Chapter 3, ''Generalized n-body Problem'').&lt;/ref&gt; of predicting the individual motions of a group of [[astronomical object|celestial object]]s interacting with each other [[gravitation]]ally. Solving this problem — from the time of the Greeks and on — has been motivated by the desire to understand the motions of the [[Sun]], [[planet]]s and the visible [[star]]s. In the 20th century, understanding the dynamics of [[globular cluster]] star systems became an important ''n''-body problem too.&lt;ref name="Heggie and Hut"&gt;See References sited for Heggie and Hut. This Wikipedia page has made their approach obsolete.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''n''-body problem in [[general relativity]] is considerably more difficult to solve.

The classical physical problem can be informally stated as: ''given the quasi-steady orbital properties'' (''instantaneous position, velocity and time'')&lt;ref&gt;''Quasi-steady'' loads refers to the instantaneous inertial loads generated by instantaneous angular velocities and accelerations, as well as translational accelerations (9 variables). It is as though one took a photograph, which also recorded the instantaneous position and properties of motion. In contrast, a ''steady-state'' condition refers to a system's state being invariant to time; otherwise, the first derivatives and all higher derivatives are zero.&lt;/ref&gt; ''of a group of celestial bodies, predict their interactive forces; and consequently, predict their true orbital motions for all future times''.&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Rosenberg states the ''n''-body problem similarly (see References): ''Each particle in a system of a finite number of particles is subjected to a Newtonian gravitational attraction from all the other particles, and to no other forces. If the initial state of the system is given, how will the particles move?'' Rosenberg failed to realize, like everyone else, that it is necessary to determine the forces ''first'' before the motions can be determined.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[two-body problem]] has been completely solved, as has the restricted [[three-body problem]].&lt;ref&gt;A general, classical solution in terms of first integrals is known to be impossible. An exact theoretical solution for arbitrary ''n'' can be approximated via [[Taylor series]], but in practice such an [[infinite series]] must be truncated, giving at best only an approximate solution; and an approach now obsolete. In addition, the ''n''-body problem may be solved using [[numerical integration]], but these, too, are approximate solutions; and again obsolete. See Sverre J. Aarseth's book '''Gravitational N-body Simulations''' listed in the References.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6730">'''Strimvelis''' is the first ''ex-vivo'' stem cell [[gene therapy]] to treat patients with a very rare disease called [[ADA-SCID]] (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency due to Adenosine Deaminase deficiency). ADA-SCID is estimated to occur in approximately 15 patients per year in Europe.

==Treatment==
The treatment is personalized for each patient; [[hematopoietic stem cell]] (HSCs) are extracted from the patient and purified so that only [[CD34]]-expressing cells remain. Those cells are [[cell culture|cultured]] with [[cytokines]] and [[growth factors]] and then transduced with a [[gammaretrovirus]] containing the human [[adenosine deaminase]] gene and then reinfused into the patient. These cells take root in the person's [[bone marrow]], replicating and creating cells that mature and create normally functioning adenosine deaminase protein, resolving the problem.&lt;ref name="EMA1"&gt;EMA [http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/003854/smops/Positive/human_smop_000951.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058001d127 Strimvelis] Page accessed April 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Candotti"&gt;Candotti F. Gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells as treatment for primary immunodeficiency diseases. Int J Hematol. 2014 Apr;99(4):383-92. Review. {{PMID|24488786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Touzot2014"&gt;Touzot F, et al  Gene therapy for inherited immunodeficiency.

Review. {{PMID|24823313}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2016, the transduced cells had a shelf life of about six hours.&lt;ref name="Fierce2016-04" /&gt;

Prior to extraction, the person is treated with [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] in order to increase the number of stem cells and improve the harvest; after that but prior to reinfusion, the person is treated with [[busulfan]] or [[melphalan]] to kill as many of the person's existing HSCs to increase the chances of the new cells' survival.&lt;ref name="Candotti" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Touzot2014" /&gt;

== Side effects ==
The most common side effects in clinical trials were [[pyrexia]], increased [[liver enzyme]] levels, [[anemia]], [[neutropenia]], [[hemolytic anaemia]], [[aplastic anaemia]] and [[thrombocytopenia]].&lt;ref name="EMA1" /&gt;

==History ==
The treatment was developed at San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy and developed by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK) through a 2010 collaboration with Fondazione Telethon and Ospedale San Raffaele. GSK, working with the biotechnology company [[MolMed]] S.p.A, developed a manufacturing process that was previously only suitable for [[clinical trials]] into one demonstrated to be robust and suitable for commercial supply.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

In April 2016, a committee at the [[European Medicines Agency]] recommended marketing approval for its use in children with [[adenosine deaminase deficiency]], for whom no matched HSC donor is available, on the basis of a clinical trial that produced a 100% survival rate; the median follow-up time was 7 years after the treatment was administered.&lt;ref name="EMA1" /&gt; 75% of people who received the treatment needed no further [[enzyme replacement therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Booth C et al. Treating Immunodeficiency through HSC Gene Therapy. Trends Mol Med. 2016 Apr;22(4):317-27. {{PMID|26993219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts had begun 14 years before. The total number of children treated was reported as 22&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;Denise Roland for the Wall Street Journal.

As of 2016, the only site approved to manufacture the treatment was MolMed.&lt;ref name="Fierce2016-04"&gt;Ben Adams for FierceBiotech Apr 4, 2016 [http://www.fiercebiotech.com/financials/strimvelis-to-be-start-of-a-whole-new-gene-therapy-platform-for-gsk-and-partners Strimvelis to be the start of a whole new gene therapy platform for GSK and partners]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 GSK announced it was looking to sell off Strimvelis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GSK gives up on rare diseases as gene therapy gets two customers |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gsk-results-rare-diseases-idUSKBN1AB2EE |work=Reuters |date=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2018 GSK sold Strimvelis to Orchard Therapeutics Ltd.; as of that time there had been only five sales of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Paton |first1=James |title=Tiny U.K. Biotech Takes On Glaxo’s $730,000 Gene Therapy |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-06/tiny-biotech-takes-on-goliath-glaxo-s-730-000-gene-therapy |work=Bloomberg |date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The price for the treatment was set at €594k, 2 times the annual cost of [[enzyme replacement therapy]] injections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grouph.com/inspiration/news/does-the-eu-price-of-strimvelis-create-a-new-glass-ceiling/|title=Does the EU price of Strimvelis create a new ‘glass ceiling’? - groupH - Inspiration|website=www.grouph.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[enzyme replacement therapy]] for ADA requires weekly injections and costs about $4.25 million for one patient over 10 years.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt;

==Author and date of Tantrasamgraha==

{{main|Nilakantha Somayaji}}

[[Nilakantha Somayaji]], the author of Tantrasamgraha, was a [[Nambudiri]] belonging to the Gargya [[gotra]] and a resident of Trikkantiyur, near [[Tirur]] in central [[Kerala]]. The name of his [[Illam]] was Kelallur. He studied under [[Damodara]], son of [[Paramesvara]]. The first and the last verses in Tantrasamgraha contain [[chronogram]]s specifying the dates, in the form [[Kali yuga|Kali]] days,  of the commencement and of the completion of book. These work out to dates in 1500-01.&lt;ref name="text"/&gt;

==Some noteworthy features of Tantrasamgraha==

"A remarkable synthesis of Indian spherical astronomical knowledge occurs in a passage in Tantrasamgraha." &lt;ref name="Glen"&gt;{{cite book|author=Glen van Brummelen|title=The mathematics of the heavens and the earth: The early history of trigonometry|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|date=2009|pages=128–129|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8956.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In astronomy, the spherical triangle formed by the [[zenith]], the [[celestial north pole]] and the [[Sun]] is called the ''astronomical triangle''. Its sides and two of its angles are important astronomical quantities. The sides are 90° - φ where φ is the observer's terrestrial [[latitude]], 90° - δ where δ is the Sun's [[declination]] and 90° - ''a '' where ''a'' is the Sun's [[altitude]] above the [[horizon]]. The important angles are the angle at the zenith which is the Sun's [[azimuth]] and the angle at the north pole which is the Sun's [[hour angle]]. The problem is to compute two of these elements when the other three elements are specified. There are precisely ten different possibilities and Tantrasamgraha contains discussions of all these possibilities with complete solutions one by one in ''one place''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Radaha Charan Gupta|title=Solution of the astronomical triangle as found in Tantrsasamgraha (A.D.1500)|journal=Indian Journal of History of Science|publisher=Indian National Academy of Science|volume=9|issue=1|url=http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b61_86.pdf|accessdate=18 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309013400/http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b61_86.pdf|archivedate=9 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The spherical triangle is handled as systematically here as in any modern textbook."&lt;ref name="Glen"/&gt;

The terrestrial [[latitude]] of an observer's position is equal to the [[zenith distance]] of the Sun at noon on the [[equinox|equinctial day]]. The effect of [[solar parallax]] on [[zenith distance]] was known to Indian astronomers right from [[Aryabhata]]. But it was [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] who first discussed the effect of solar parallax on the observer's latitude. Tantrasamgraha gives the magnitude of this correction and also a correction due to the finite size of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal|author=K. Ramasubramanian|author2=M.S.

'''Tired light''' is a class of hypothetical [[redshift]] mechanisms that was proposed as an alternative explanation for the [[Hubble's law|redshift-distance relationship]]. These models have been proposed as alternatives to the models that require [[metric expansion of space]] of which the [[Big Bang]] and the [[Steady State Theory|Steady State]] [[physical cosmology|cosmologies]] are the most famous examples. The concept was first proposed in 1929 by [[Fritz Zwicky]], who suggested that if photons lost energy over time through collisions with other particles in a regular way, the more distant objects would appear redder than more nearby ones. Zwicky himself acknowledged that any sort of [[scattering]] of light would blur the images of distant objects more than what is seen. Additionally, the [[Tolman surface brightness test|surface brightness of galaxies evolving with time]], [[time dilation]] of cosmological sources, and a thermal spectrum of the [[cosmic microwave background]] have been observed — these effects should not be present if the cosmological redshift was due to any tired light scattering mechanism.&lt;ref name=nedwright&gt;[[Ned Wright|Wright, E.

==History and reception==
{{See also|Redshift|Non-standard cosmology#Tired light}}
Tired [[light]] was an idea that came about due to the observation made by [[Edwin Hubble]] that [[galaxy|distant galaxies]] have [[redshift]]s proportional to their [[distance measures (cosmology)|distance]]. Redshift is a shift in the [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectrum]] of the emitted [[electromagnetic radiation]] from an object toward lower energies and frequencies, associated with the phenomenon of the [[Doppler effect]]. Observers of [[spiral nebula]]e such as [[Vesto Slipher]] observed that these objects (now known to be separate [[galaxy|galaxies]]) generally exhibited redshift rather than blueshifts independent of where they were located. Since the relation holds in all directions it cannot be attributed to normal movement with respect to a background which would show an assortment of redshifts and blueshifts. Everything is moving ''away'' from the Milky Way galaxy. Hubble's contribution was to show that the magnitude of the redshift correlated strongly with the distance to the galaxies.

Basing on Slipher's and Hubble's data, in 1927 [[Georges Lemaître]] realized that this correlation fit non-static solutions to the equations of Einstein's theory of gravity, the Friedmann–Lemaître solutions. However Lemaître's article was appreciated only after Hubble's publication of 1929. The universal redshift-distance relation in this solution is attributable to the effect an expanding universe has on a photon traveling on a null [[spacetime interval]] (also known as a "light-like" [[geodesic]]). In this formulation, there was still an analogous effect to the [[Doppler effect]], though relative velocities need to be handled with more care since [[comoving distance|distances]] can be defined in different ways in [[metric expansion of space|expanding metrics]].

At the same time, other explanations were proposed that did not concord with general relativity. [[Edward Arthur Milne|Edward Milne]] proposed an explanation compatible with [[special relativity]] but not general relativity that there was a giant explosion that could explain redshifts (see [[Milne universe]]). Others proposed that [[systematics|systematic effects]] could explain the redshift-distance correlation. Along this line, [[Fritz Zwicky]] proposed a "tired light" mechanism in 1929.&lt;ref name="Zwicky"&gt;Zwicky, F. 1929. ''On the Red Shift of Spectral Lines through Interstellar Space.'' PNAS '''15''':773–779. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1929PNAS...15..773Z Abstract] (ADS) [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprintframed/15/10/773 Full article] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Zwicky suggested that [[photon]]s might slowly lose [[energy]] as they travel vast [[distance]]s through a [[static universe]] by interaction with matter or other photons, or by some novel physical mechanism. Since a decrease in [[energy]] corresponds to an increase in light's [[wavelength]], this effect would produce a [[redshift]] in [[spectral line]]s that increase [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionally]] with the distance of the source. The term "tired light" was coined by [[Richard Tolman]] in the early 1930s as a way to refer to this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Myron W. |last2=Vigier |first2=Jean-Pierre |title=The Enigmatic Photon: Theory and Practice of the B3 Field |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-0p1eOCYeIC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=%22tired+light%22+coined+tolman |page=29 |publisher=Springer |date=1996 |isbn=978-0-7923-4044-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tired light mechanisms were among the proposed alternatives to the [[Big Bang]] and the [[Steady State Theory|Steady State]] [[physical cosmology|cosmologies]], both of which relied on the general relativistic expansion of the universe of the FRW metric. Through the middle of the twentieth century, most cosmologists supported one of these two [[paradigm]]s, but there were a few scientists, especially those who were working on alternatives to general relativity, who worked with the tired light alternative.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, O. C. 1939. ''Possible applications of supernovae to the study of the nebular red shifts.'' Astrophysical Journal '''90''':634–636. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1939ApJ....90..634W Archived article (ADS)]&lt;/ref&gt; As the discipline of [[observational cosmology]] developed in the late twentieth century and the associated data became more numerous and accurate, the Big Bang emerged as the cosmological theory most supported by the observational evidence, and it remains the accepted [[scientific consensus|consensus model]] with a current [[Lambda-CDM model|parametrization]] that precisely specifies the state and evolution of the universe. Although the proposals of "tired light cosmologies" are now more-or-less relegated to the dustbin of history, as a completely alternative proposal tired-light cosmologies were considered a remote possibility worthy of some consideration in cosmology texts well into the 1980s, though it was dismissed as an unlikely and ''ad hoc'' proposal by mainstream astrophysicists.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, page 397 of [[Joseph Silk]]'s book, ''The Big Bang''. (1980) W. H. Freeman and Company. {{ISBN|0-7167-1812-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tolman_surface_brightness_test.png|thumb|300px|The Tolman surface brightness test rules out the tired light explanation for the cosmological redshift.]]
By the 1990s and on into the twenty-first century, a number of falsifying observations have shown that "tired light" hypotheses are not viable explanations for cosmological redshifts.&lt;ref name=treu&gt;Tommaso Treu, Lecture slides for [[University of California at Santa Barbara]] Astrophysics course. [http://www.physics.ucsb.edu/~tt/ASTRO2/lecture16.pdf page 16]{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623125705/http://www.physics.ucsb.edu/~tt/ASTRO2/lecture16.pdf |date=2010-06-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in a static universe with tired light mechanisms, the surface brightness of stars and galaxies should be constant, that is, the farther an object is, the less light we receive, but its apparent area diminishes as well, so the light received divided by the apparent area should be constant. In an expanding universe, the surface brightness diminishes with distance. As the observed object recedes, photons are emitted at a reduced rate because each photon has to travel a distance that is a little longer than the previous one, while its energy is reduced a little because of increasing redshift at a larger distance. On the other hand, in an expanding universe, the object appears to be larger than it really is, because it was closer to us when the photons started their travel. This causes a difference in surface brilliance of objects between a static and an expanding Universe. This is known as the [[Tolman surface brightness test]] that in those studies favors the expanding universe hypothesis and rules out static tired light models.&lt;ref name = "Geller"&gt;Geller J. et al.,[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1972ApJ...174....1G&amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;type=PRINTER&amp;filetype=.pdf Test of the expanding universe postulate] The astrophysical journal 174, p.1 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldhaber|first1=G.|last2=Groom|first2=D.

Redshift is directly observable and used by cosmologists as a direct measure of [[cosmological time|lookback time]].  They often refer to age and distance to objects in terms of redshift rather than years or light-years. In such a scale, the [[Big Bang]] corresponds to a redshift of infinity.&lt;ref name="Geller" /&gt;  [[Alternative theories of gravity]] that do not have an expanding universe in them need an alternative to explain the correspondence between redshift and distance that is ''[[sui generis]]'' to the [[Metric expansion of space|expanding metrics]] of general relativity.

==Specific falsified models==
[[Image:Hubble ultra deep field high rez edit1.jpg|thumb|right|275 px| The [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]] is an image of galaxies that are in excess of 10 billion light years away. If tired light was a correct explanation, these galaxies would appear blurred in comparison to closer galaxies. That they do not rules out the suggestion that scattering processes are causing the redshift-distance relation.]]
In general, any "tired light" mechanism must solve some basic problems, in that the observed redshift must:
*admit the same measurement in any wavelength-band
*not exhibit blurring
*follow the detailed Hubble relation observed with [[supernova]] data (see [[accelerating universe]])
*explain associated [[time dilation]] of cosmologically distant events.

A number of tired light mechanisms have been suggested over the years. [[Fritz Zwicky]], in his paper proposing these models investigated a number of redshift explanations, ruling out some himself. The simplest form of a tired light theory assumes an exponential decrease in photon energy with distance traveled:

:&lt;math&gt;E(x)=E_0 \exp{(-\frac{x}{R_0})}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of the photon at distance &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from the source of light, &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of the photon at the source of light, and &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; is a large constant characterizing the "resistance of the space". To correspond to [[Hubble's law]], the constant &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; must be several giga[[parsec]]s. &lt;!--It must be large enough to take into account any deviation from Hubble's law--&gt; For example, Zwicky considered whether an integrated [[Compton effect]] could account for the scale normalization of the above model:

{{quote|... light coming from distant nebulae would undergo a shift to the red by [[Compton effect]] on those free electrons [in interstellar spaces] [...] But then the light scattered in all directions would make the interstellar space intolerably opaque which disposes of the above explanation. [...] it is evident that any explanation based on a scattering process like the Compton effect or the [[Raman effect]], etc., will be in a hopeless position regarding the good definition of the images.&lt;ref name="Zwicky" /&gt;}}

This expected "blurring" of cosmologically distant objects is not seen in the observational evidence, though it would take much larger telescopes than those available at that time to show this with certainty. Alternatively, Zwicky proposed a kind of [[Sachs–Wolfe effect]] explanation for the redshift distance relation:

{{quote|One might expect a shift of spectral lines due to the difference of the static gravitational potential at different distances from the center of a galaxy. This effect, of course, has no relation to the distance of the observed galaxy from our own system and, therefore, cannot provide any explanation of the phenomenon discussed in this paper.&lt;ref name="Zwicky" /&gt;}}

Zwicky's proposals were carefully presented as falsifiable according to later observations:

{{quote|... [a] gravitational analogue of the Compton effect [...] It is easy to see that the above redshift should broaden these absorption lines asymmetrically toward the red. If these lines can be photographed with a high enough dispersion, the displacement of the center of gravity of the line will give the redshift independent of the velocity of the system from which the light is emitted.&lt;ref name="Zwicky" /&gt;}}

Such broadening of absorption lines is not seen in high-redshift objects, thus falsifying this particular hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, high-redshift spectra shown at http://astrobites.com/2011/04/27/prospecting-for-c-iv-at-high-redshifts/&lt;/ref&gt;

Zwicky also notes, in the same paper, that according to a tired light model a distance-redshift relationship would necessarily be present in the light from sources within our own galaxy (even if the redshift would be so small that it would be hard to measure), that do not appear under a recessional-velocity based theory. He writes, referring to sources of light within our galaxy: "It is especially desirable to determine the redshift independent of the proper velocities of the objects observed".&lt;ref name="Zwicky" /&gt; Subsequent to this, astronomers have patiently mapped out the three-dimensional velocity-position [[phase space]] for the galaxy and found the redshifts and blueshifts of galactic objects to accord well with the statistical distribution of a spiral galaxy, eliminating the [[intrinsic redshift]] component as an effect.&lt;ref&gt;Binney &amp; Merrifield: GALACTIC ASTRONOMY, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-02565-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following after Zwicky in 1935, [[Edwin Hubble]] and [[Richard Tolman]] compared recessional redshift with a non-recessional one, writing that they:
{{quote|... both incline to the opinion, however, that if the red-shift is not due to recessional motion, its explanation will probably involve some quite new physical principles [... and] use of a static Einstein model of the universe, combined with the assumption that the photons emitted by a nebula lose energy on their journey to the observer by some unknown effect, which is linear with distance, and which leads to a decrease in frequency, without appreciable transverse deflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hubble |first1=Edwin |last2=Tolman |first2=Richard C. |authorlink1=Edwin Hubble |authorlink2=Richard C.

In the early 1950s, [[Erwin Finlay-Freundlich]] proposed a redshift as "the result of loss of energy by observed photons traversing a radiation field."&lt;ref name="finlay"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Finlay-Freundlich | first1 = E. | date = 1954 | title = Red-Shifts in the Spectra of Celestial Bodies | url = http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0370-1298/67/2/114 | journal = Proc.

The '''''Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology''''' (or '''''TIP''''') published by the [[Geological Society of America]] and the [[University of Kansas]] Press, is a definitive multi-authored work of some 50 [[volume]]s, written by more than 300 [[paleontologist]]s, and covering every [[Scientific classification|phylum, class, order, family]], and [[genus]] of [[fossil]] and [[Extant taxon|extant]] (still living) [[invertebrate]] animals.  The prehistoric invertebrates are described as to their [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[paleoecology]], [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] and [[Paleogeography|paleogeographic]] range.  However, genera with no [[fossil record]] whatsoever have just a very brief listing.

Publication of the decades-long ''Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology'' is a work-in-progress; and therefore it is not yet complete: For example, there is no volume yet published regarding the post-[[Paleozoic era]] [[Caenogastropoda|caenogastropods]] (a [[mollusca]]n group including the [[whelk]] and [[Common periwinkle|periwinkle]]). Furthermore, every so often, previously published volumes of the ''Treatise'' are revised.

== Evolution of the project ==
[[Raymond C. Moore]], the project's founder and first [[editing|editor]], originally envisioned this ''Treatise'' in [[invertebrate paleontology]] as comprising just three large volumes, and totaling only three thousand pages.

The project began with work on a few, mostly slim volumes in which a single senior specialist in a distinct field of invertebrate [[paleozoology]] would summarize one particular group. As a result, each publication became a comprehensive compilation of ''everything known'' at that time for each group. Examples of this stage of the project are ''Part G. [[Bryozoa]]'', by [[Ray S. Bassler]] (the first volume, published in 1953), and ''Part P. [[Arthropoda]] Part 2, the [[Chelicerata]]'' by [[Alexander Petrunkevitch]] (1955/1956).

Around 1959 or 1960, as more and larger invertebrate groups were being addressed, the incompleteness of the then-current state of affairs became apparent.  So several senior editors of the ''Treatise'' started major research programs to fill in the evident gaps.  Consequently, the succeeding volumes, while still maintaining the original format, began to change from being a set of single-authored compilations into being major research projects in their own right.  Newer volumes had a committee and a chief editor for each volume, with yet other authors and researchers assigned particular sections.  [[Museum]] collections that had not been previously described were studied; and sometimes new major taxonomic families—and even orders—had to be described.  More attention was given to transitional fossils and [[evolution]]ary [[Radiation (biology)|radiation]]—eventually producing a much-more complete [[encyclopedia]] of [[invertebrate paleontology]].

But even in the second set of volumes, the various [[taxa]] were still described and organized in a classical [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] sense.  The more-recent volumes began to introduce [[phylogenetic]] and [[Cladistics|cladistic]] ideas, along with new developments and discoveries in fields such as [[biogeography]],  [[molecular phylogeny]], [[paleobiology]], and [[organic chemistry]], so that the current edition of ''[[Brachiopoda]]'' (1997 to 2002) is classified according to a cladistic arrangement, with three [[Phylum (biology)|subphyl]]a and a large number of [[Class (biology)|class]]es replacing the original two classes of Articulata and Inarticulata.

All these discoveries led to revisions and additional volumes.  Even those taxa already covered were expanded: Books such as those  regarding the ''[[Cnidaria]]'' (vol. F), the ''Brachiopoda'' (vol. H) and the ''[[Trilobita]]'' (vol. O) each went from one modest publication to three large volumes.  And yet another volume regarding the brachiopods (number five) was published in 2006.

Until 2007, the editor of the ''Treatise'' was [[Roger L. Kaesler]] at [[The Paleontological Institute]] at the [[University of Kansas]] in Lawrence, Kansas.

== Layout of the articles ==
From the beginning, the character of the ''Treatise'' volumes has followed and further developed the pattern of the classic ''Invertebrate Paleontology'' written by Moore, Lalicker and Fischer (1953).

Following their lead, the ''Treatise'' includes in a typical article (a) a description of the basic [[anatomy]] of the modern members of each invertebrate group, (b) distinctive features of the fossils, (c) a comprehensive illustrated [[glossary]] of terms, (d) a short discussion of the evolutionary history of the group, (e) a stratigraphic range chart, done at the level of the major subdivision (lower, middle and upper) of each [[Geologic period]].

This is followed by (f) a listing and technical description of every known genus, along with (g) geographic distribution (usually by continent only, but occasionally by country) and (h) stratigraphic range.

Next come (i) one or two representative [[species]] illustrated by line drawings (in the early volumes) or by black-and-white [[photograph]]s (in subsequent volumes), each accompanied by an appropriate reference for that genus.  Furthermore, each ''Treatise'' article includes (j) the  date, authorship, and scientific history of the [[taxon|taxa]].

Finally, there is (k) a comprehensive bibliography and list of references.  Not only that, but the more recent volumes and revisions also include (l) new fossil and phylogenetic discoveries, (m) advances in numerical and cladistic methods, (n) analysis of the group's [[genome]], (o) its molecular phylogeny, and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4193">'''Uncertain inference''' was first described by [[C. J. van Rijsbergen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | author=C. J. van Rijsbergen | title=A non-classical logic for information retrieval | publisher=The Computer Journal | pages=481–485 | year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a way to formally define a query and document relationship in [[Information retrieval]]. This formalization is a [[logical consequence|logical implication]] with an attached measure of uncertainty.

==Definitions==
Rijsbergen proposes that the measure of [[uncertainty]] of a document ''d'' to a query ''q'' be the probability of its logical implication, i.e.:

:&lt;math&gt;P(d \to q)&lt;/math&gt;

A user's query can be interpreted as a set of assertions about the desired document. It is the system's task to [[inference|infer]], given a particular document, if the query assertions are true. If they are, the document is retrieved.
In many cases the contents of documents are not sufficient to assert the queries. A [[knowledge base]] of facts and rules is needed, but some of them may be uncertain because there may be a probability associated to using them for inference. Therefore, we can also refer to this as ''plausible inference''. The [[plausibility]] of an inference &lt;math&gt;d \to q&lt;/math&gt; is a function of the plausibility of each query assertion. Rather than retrieving a document that exactly matches the query we should rank the documents based on their plausibility in regards to that query.
Since ''d'' and ''q'' are both generated by users, they are error prone; thus &lt;math&gt;d \to q&lt;/math&gt; is uncertain. This will affect the plausibility of a given query.

By doing this it accomplishes two things:
* Separate the processes of revising probabilities from the logic
* Separate the treatment of relevance from the treatment of requests

[[Multimedia]] documents, like images or videos, have different inference properties for each datatype. They are also different from text document properties. The framework of plausible inference allows us to measure and combine the probabilities coming from these different properties.

Uncertain inference generalizes the notions of [[autoepistemic logic]], where truth values are either known or unknown, and when known, they are true or false.

==Example==
If we have a query of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;q = A \wedge B \wedge C&lt;/math&gt;

where A, B and C are query assertions, then for a document D we want the probability:

:&lt;math&gt;P (D \to (A \wedge B \wedge C))&lt;/math&gt;

If we transform this into the [[conditional probability]] &lt;math&gt;P ((A \wedge B \wedge C) | D)&lt;/math&gt; and if the query assertions are independent we can calculate the overall probability of the implication as the product of the individual assertions probabilities.

==Further work==
Croft and Krovetz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | title=Interactive retrieval office documents | url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/45410.45435 | author1=W. B. Croft | author2=R. Krovetz | year=1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; applied uncertain inference to an information retrieval system for office documents they called ''OFFICER''. In office documents the independence assumption is valid since the query will focus on their individual attributes. Besides analysing the content of documents one can also query about the author, size, topic or collection for example. They devised methods to compare document and query attributes, infer their plausibility and combine it into an overall rating for each document. Besides that uncertainty of document and query contents also had to be addressed.

[[Probabilistic logic network]]s is a system for performing uncertain inference; crisp true/false truth values are replaced not only by a probability, but also by a confidence level, indicating the certitude of the probability.

[[Markov logic network]]s allow uncertain inference to be performed; uncertainties are computed using the [[maximum entropy principle]], in analogy to the way that [[Markov chain]]s describe the uncertainty of [[finite state machine]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="892">The '''Utinahica''' were a [[Timucua]] tribe and [[chiefdom]] in the 17th century. They lived in what is now the southeastern part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Their descendants may include the [[Creek Indian]]s. 

A [[Spanish missions in Florida|Spanish mission]], [[Santa Isabel de Utinahica]], was established in the chief town of the Utinahica on the [[Altamaha River]], near the present site of [[Jacksonville, Georgia]], in the first half of the 17th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3649">The '''Wau Holland Foundation''' (German: Wau Holland Stiftung; WHS) is a nonprofit foundation based in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]].

It was established in 2003 in memory of [[Wau Holland]], co-founder of the [[Chaos Computer Club]]. Loosely connected with the Chaos Computer Club,  the foundation aims to preserve and further Holland's ideas in fields such as [[technology assessment]], the [[history of technology]] and [[freedom of information]]. Specifically, it promotes the use of electronic media for educational purposes, as well as events on the social aspects of new technologies.

Foundation projects include the "Archive of Contemporary History of Technology (Hacker archive)", which documents the history of the [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] scene, and a campaign against [[voting machine]]s (both in collaboration with the Chaos Computer Club). The foundation also processes donations in Europe to support the [[WikiLeaks]] organization.

As of December 2010, their endowment was about 62,000 €. It also owns land (valued at about 1500 €), currently leased to a public institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wauland.de/en/about.html "About the Wau Holland Foundation"], [http://www.wauland.de/ Wau Holland Foundation web site].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to WikiLeaks ==

The foundation has collected over $1.2 million USD for [[WikiLeaks]] since it began accepting donations on the organization's behalf in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,734318,00.html "'Donations Were Never as Strong as Now'"], interview with Hendrik Fulda, board member of the Wau Holland Foundation, [[Spiegel Online]], December 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 4 December 2010, [[PayPal]] turned off donations in response to the foundation's connection to WikiLeaks, alleging that the account was being used for "activities that encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to engage in illegal activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/12/04/world/main7117213.shtml |title=PayPal Turns Off Tap for WikiLeaks Donations |author=Associated Press |date=2010-12-04 |work= |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 December 2010 the foundation released a press statement, saying it has filed legal action against PayPal for blocking its account and for libel due to PayPal's allegations of "illegal activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =   | first =  | title =Presseerklärung der Wau Holland Stiftung zur Sperrung ihres Account bei PayPal | publisher = wauland.de| date = 2010-12-08| url = http://wauland.de/presseerklaerung_accountsperrung.html| accessdate = 2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of this activity of collecting donations for Wikileaks, its charitable status has been challenged and later revoked by the German authorities. Its charitable status has been reinstated on 12 December 2012, applied retroactively for 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wauland.de/en/news.html |title=Wau Holland Stiftung -- News|author=Wau Holland Foundation|date=2012-12-12 |work= |publisher=Wau Holland Foundation |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Willard Lamb Velie''' (1866 – October 24, 1928) was a businessman based in [[Moline, Illinois]].  He was an executive at [[John Deere|Deere &amp; Company]] before starting his own companies, which grew to become [[Velie|Velie Motor Company]].  He developed advanced engines for automobiles and airplanes.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
W. L. Velie was born in [[Moline, Illinois]].  He was the third of five children born to Stephen H. Velie and Emma Deere, the daughter of [[John Deere (inventor)|John Deere]].  Stephen Velie had moved to [[Rock Island, Illinois]] to work for the C. C. Webber &amp; Company.  In 1863 he entered into a partnership with his father-in-law, and when the company was incorporated he was elected to the offices of secretary and treasurer.&lt;ref name=biographies&gt;{{cite web|url=http://all-biographies.com/business/stephen_henry_velie.htm|title= Stephen Henry Velie|publisher=All Biographies|accessdate=2011-04-19|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  W. L. Velie had two older brothers, a younger brother who died as an infant and a sister.  He graduated from [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]] in 1885&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwdev.andover.edu/About/NotableAlumni/LongList/Pages/1800a.aspx|title=Phillips Academy-1800s|publisher=Phillips Academy|accessdate=2011-04-19|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yale University]] in 1888.  After graduation he set out for [[Montana]].

===Deere &amp; Company===
In 1890 Velie returned to Moline and began working at Deere &amp; Company as a clerk.&lt;ref name= Board&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l4YE4jqmr_UC&amp;pg=PA94 |title= Remembering Fort Myers: the city of palms|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=2011-04-19|last=Board|first=Prudy Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a year he became a sales manager.  When his father died in 1895 W.L. replaced him as the corporate secretary and a member of the board.  In 1902 Velie founded his first company, the Velie Carriage Company of Moline.  It manufactured buggies, carriages, surreys, driving wagons, and spring wagons called the "Wrought Iron Line" of vehicles.&lt;ref name= Kruse2&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bleedinggreen.com/GG2000/gg-11-13-00.html |title= The adventurous Velies: All in the family (part two)|publisher=Green Girl  Newsletter (November 13, 2000)|accessdate=2011-04-19|last= Kruse |first= Brenda }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1907 alone the company made 21,000 buggies and surreys.  When his cousin [[William Butterworth (businessman)|William Butterworth]] became president of Deere &amp; Company in 1908, Velie was elected vice-president.&lt;ref name= Kruse1&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bleedinggreen.com/GG2000/gg-11-06-00.html |title= The adventurous Velies: All in the family |publisher=Green Girl  Newsletter (November 6, 2000)|accessdate=2011-04-19|last= Kruse |first= Brenda }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later he became the first chairman of the executive committee when it was formed.  At the same time he founded the Velie Engineering Company, which produced gas, steam and electric motors and engines, plus automobile accessories and motor trucks.&lt;ref name= Kruse2/&gt;  In 1916 he merged his two companies and began making tractors.  Their first was the Velie Biltwel 12-24, a four-cylinder tractor powered by a Velie-built engine.&lt;ref name= Kruse1/&gt;  While this appeared to be a  conflict of interest Velie was a strong supporter of Deere &amp; Company’s acquisition or development of a tractor.&lt;ref name= Kruse1/&gt;  For the most part, Velie’s product lines and Deere’s lines remained separate.  He and Butterworth were in disagreement, however, about the company’s operation and so Velie resigned his executive committee positions in 1918 and severed all ties with the company in 1921.

===Velie Motor Corporation===
[[File:1927_Velie_Model_50_Standard_Sedan,_Moline.jpg|200px|left|thumb|1927 Velie Model 50 Standard Sedan]]
While still at Deere &amp; Company, W.L Velie incorporated the Velie Motor Vehicle Company in 1908.&lt;ref name= Kruse2/&gt;  While he kept his tractor lines separate from the Deere line, his automobiles were marketed through Deere’s branch houses.&lt;ref name= Kruse1/&gt;   When he merged his companies in 1916 he formed the Velie Motor Company.  The products produced by the company came to be known for their quality at a reasonable price.&lt;ref name= Kruse2/&gt;  By 1912 the company’s stock was valued at $1.5 million&lt;ref name= qconline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qconline.com/progress98/places/237.htm|title= Velie's a reminder of bygone era |publisher= qconline.com|accessdate=2011-04-19|last= Larson |first= Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; and four years later it was worth $2 million.&lt;ref name= Kruse2/&gt;  Between 1913 and 1915 the Velie factory was turning out an average of 30 cars a day.&lt;ref name=Renkes&gt;{{cite book|last=Renkes|first=Jim|title= The Quad-Cities and The People|volume=|year=1994|publisher=American &amp; World Geographic Publishing|location=Helena, MT |pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1920 the buggy business was phased out and automobile production peaked at 9,000.  Estimates of how many motor vehicles  Velie produced  in the two decades the factory was in operation range between 75,000&lt;ref name= Hayes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qconline.com/progress99/4cars.shtml|title= Quad-Cities an early Detroit |publisher= qconline.com|accessdate=2011-04-19|last= Hayes |first= S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 300,000.&lt;ref name= Kruse2/&gt;  Velie was not the only person in the Tri-Cities, now known as the [[Quad Cities]], who was building automobiles.  At one point in the early 20th century there were ten different makes being produced in the area.&lt;ref name=Renkes/&gt; Velie was the most successful.&lt;ref name= Hayes/&gt;  The [[U.S. Navy]] chose the Velie engine along with seven others as the best automobile motors for adaptation to military use.  Other winners included the [[Brewster &amp; Co.|Brewster]], [[Duesenberg]], [[Fiat]], [[Hispania Suiza]], [[Issota Franchina]], [[Marmon Motor Car Company|Marmon]]  and [[Packard]].&lt;ref name= Board/&gt;  Between 1916 and 1920 the company also produced the Biltwel 12-25" tractor, which was powered by a Velie engine.

[[File:Velie-powered Monocoupe 70 Moline.jpg|200px|thumb|A Velie Monocoup airplane on display at Quad City International Airport in Moline]]
Willard Velie, Jr. was named the company’s vice-president in 1927.  He was the one who introduced the production of airplanes into the family business.  They developed the first six-cylinder valve-in-head airplane motor in 1919.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson |first=Fredrick I. (ed.)|title= Joined by a River: Quad Cities |volume=|year=1982|publisher=Lee Enterprises|location=Davenport |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also developed a five-cylinder radial aircraft that powered their [[Velie Monocoupe]].  In 1926 [[Donald Arthur Luscombe|Don Luscombe]] of [[Davenport, Iowa]] and Frank Wallace of [[Bettendorf, Iowa]] formed the Central States Aero Company and began building [[monocoupe]] airplanes.  The Velie’s started working with the company and then bought it in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 143.&lt;/ref&gt;  The result was Mono Aircraft, Inc., a subsidiary of Velie Motor Corporation.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

The [[United States Department of Commerce]] awarded the Velie Monocoupe its highest rating, and plans were developed to build a four seat monocoach.&lt;ref name= Kruse2/&gt;  The plane would never be built.  W.L. Velie, Sr. died in October 1928.  A month later Willard Jr. stopped the production of automobiles and sold the company's interests to an [[Indianapolis]] firm.  Four months later Willard, Jr. died and the airplane interests were sold to a [[St. Louis, Missouri]] firm.  The Velie Motor Corporation came to an end.

===Private life===
[[File:Villa Velie.jpg|thumb|left|Villa Velie in 2017]]
W. L. Velie married Annie Flowerree in [[Helena, Montana]] on May 21, 1890.&lt;ref name= rootsweb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~iascott/may1890clips.htm|title= Newspaper Clippings…Morning Democrat, Davenport, Iowa (May 14, 1890)|publisher=rootsweb|accessdate=2011-04-19|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was the daughter of Daniel Augustus Greene Flowerree, who was a  millionaire cattle rancher.&lt;ref name= Board/&gt;  She was also a sister to his college roommate William Flowerree.  The Velie’s raised two children Willard Jr. and Marjorie.

Velie built a palatial home, named Villa Velie, for his family on a {{convert|500|acre|km2|adj=on}} site on the south side of Moline, overlooking the [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock River]] Valley.&lt;ref name= Wundram &gt;{{cite book|last=Wundram|first=Bill|title=A Time We Remember: Celebrating a Century in our Quad-Cities|volume= |year=1999 |publisher=Quad-City Times |location=Davenport, Iowa|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He and his wife were inspired by the many [[Italianate|Italian Villas]] they saw while traveling through Europe.&lt;ref name= Williams&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams, Basil|first=Lewis, Blake|title=The Quad Cities USA Book|volume= |year=1986 |publisher=Basil Williams &amp; Associates |location=Bettendorf, Iowa|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The house was built from 1912-1913 in the Italian Villa style by artisans from [[Italy]] and [[Greece]].&lt;ref name= qconline/&gt;  It contained 46 rooms, of which 14 were bedrooms and 12 bathrooms.  The floors on the ground floor and the first floor were covered in marble.  Built-in bookcases lined the library walls, which were also frescoed. The slopes toward the river were planted with 21 grape varieties from southern [[France]], and the family produced their own private label wine.&lt;ref name= qconline/&gt;  The grounds also featured a conservatory that housed banana trees, a putting green, sculptured gardens and a ski run that extended to the river.  The family moved to a more modest dwelling during the [[Great Depression]].  For a time the house sat empty.  In 1941 the home was bought by Stanley Wiedner and it became the Plantation Restaurant.  It was succeeded by a restaurant called W.L. Velie’s in 1982.  Today the home is the home of [[QCR Holdings]] and a branch location of Quad City Bank and Trust.&lt;ref name= qconline/&gt;

[[File:Velie family monument.JPG|thumb|The monument for the Velie family graves in Riverside Cemetery.]]

The Velie’s spent their winters in [[Fort Myers, Florida]].&lt;ref name= Board/&gt; They built a home there next to Annie’s parents along the [[Caloosahatchee River]].  
  
W.L. Velie died of an [[embolism]] complicated by a heart problem on October 10, 1928.  He was buried in [[Riverside Cemetery (Moline, Illinois)|Riverside Cemetery]] in Moline.
