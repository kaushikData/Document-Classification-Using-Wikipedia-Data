      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4983">The [[Arts Council]] of [[Pakistan]] [[Karachi]] is arguably the largest council made for the purpose of promoting [[art]]s and [[culture]] in Pakistan, and perhaps the busiest in terms of organizing events on a yearly basis. Given the kind of [[sociopolitical]] turn that the country has taken with reference to [[religious extremism]], it makes the council all the more significant an institution to uphold and foster the traditions of the arts that aim to give society a balanced approach to life. It is the country's oldest and most famous NGO (non-government organization) that deals in promotion and development of arts and crafts in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;[https://tribune.com.pk/story/1250759/glue-holds-despite-borders-urdu-literature-connects-india-pakistan/ The glue that holds: 'Despite borders, Urdu literature connects India, Pakistan'] The Express Tribune newspaper, Published 1 December 2016, Retrieved 17 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=karachievents&gt;[http://www.karachievents.com/arts-council-pakistan/ Profile of The Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi], Retrieved 17 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawn1&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/378131/karachi-arts-council-auditorium Grants from the government for Arts Council of Pakistan], Dawn newspaper, Published 25 December 2004, Retrieved 17 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==

In 1948, a group of art enthusiasts gathered and formed themselves into a society under the name of ''Karachi [[Fine Arts]] Society''. It was first of its kind to promote and encourage arts and culture in Pakistan. It held exhibitions and promoted activities relating to [[theatre]].

The funds of the society were contributed personally by the members themselves. They had no permanent building of their own. Their meetings were therefore held at the residences of the office bearers. Art exhibitions were held in rented space in private houses. Six years later in 1954, the ''Karachi Fine Arts Society'' was reorganized into a body called the ''Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi''. This organization was registered with the registrar of societies, Karachi, under Act XX1 of 1860. (The Registration Certificate was issued on 10 May 1955). After its formation, the Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi stepped up activities in the field of arts and culture. It also has sponsored production of plays and musical programs - for example, it recently held a ''Musical Tribute Event'' in 2017 in honor of the late [[Bade Fateh Ali Khan]] (Pakistan's famous classical music singer) in its auditorium.&lt;ref name=ArtsCouncil&gt;[http://artscouncil.org.pk/acp/index.php/2017/03/02/tribute-to-music-icon-ustad-fateh-ali-khan/ Tribute to Music icon Ustad Fateh Ali Khan], Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi website, Published 2 March 2017, Retrieved 17 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bald arch''' is a technical term used to describe the decay of the crucial [[Keystone (architecture)|keystones]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;in stone or masonry buildings. Left unchecked, the progression of the condition will eventually lead to the failure of the arch and any structures supported by it.  

== Causes ==
The structural degradation of arches can occur for a variety of reasons. The stones or masonry components that make up an arch are vulnerable to physical and chemical attack over long periods of time. Sources of damage include atmospheric conditions, human induced mechanical stress, improper design, and natural disturbances like earthquakes or wildlife.

=== Ground Shifting ===
Movement of the ground beneath an arch will eventually destroy an arch by changing the mechanical relationship between stones in the arch. An arch will evenly distribute forces across the surfaces of each stone when it is properly emplaced. Moving the ground below the arch will negatively affect the distribution of stress. An arch will slump in the center if the two sides move apart. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/883973264|title=Conservation of ruins|last=John.|first=Ashurst,|date=2007|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=9780750664295|oclc=883973264}}&lt;/ref&gt;If the sides are moved closer together, a hinge will form in the arch, increasing the stress on that area.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feilden|first=Bernard|date=2007-06-07|title=Conservation of Historic Buildings|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780080502915|doi=10.4324/9780080502915}}&lt;/ref&gt;Arches can also become angled away from level, inducing forces that are not normal to the faces of the individual stones. 

The ground can shift over long periods of time for many reasons. Earthquakes, frost, swelling clays, tree roots, animal burrows, and unstable soils all have the potential to move the foundation of a building.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Weathering ===
The weather plays an important role in destroying stone structures. Daily or annual freeze/thaw cycles cause water trapped in cracks to expand, breaking up the stones or causing them to shift from their original setting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;Frost heaving in the ground may move the structure, making it unstable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;Precipitation can also be detrimental for certain materials. Limestone and cement are subject to weathering from rain.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/878934936|title=Conservation of buildings|last=John.|first=Harvey,|date=1972|publisher=John Baker|oclc=878934936}}&lt;/ref&gt;Natural rainwater has a pH of 5.6 due to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Willey|first=Joan D.|last2=Bennett|first2=Ramona I.|last3=Williams|first3=Jeanne M.|last4=Denne|first4=Robert K.|last5=Kornegay|first5=Cynthia R.|last6=Perlotto|first6=Mark S.|last7=Moore|first7=Beth M.|date=January 1988|title=Effect of storm type on rainwater composition in southeastern North Carolina|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00166a003|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=22|issue=1|pages=41–46|doi=10.1021/es00166a003|issn=0013-936X}}&lt;/ref&gt;This is low enough to dissolve the calcium carbonate that constitutes limestone and cement. Air pollution can greatly enhance this effect by dropping the pH of the rainwater.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;In the eastern United States, the pH of rainwater can be as low as 2.0.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Rain can also dissolve salts from the stone or other sources and redeposit the salt into cracks in the stones or between them. The salts will then crystalize as the water evaporates, putting pressure on the edges of the crack and causing the stones to move or chip.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;This effect is most pronounced in coastal and urban environments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;Salt damage is also prevalent in cities that employ salts to deice roads and sidewalks. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

If an arch includes mortar between the stones the mortar becomes a likely point of weathering. As the mortar decays, the stones on either side will become unsupported and lead to failure.

=== Vibration ===
Human activities can inadvertently damage stone arches. The vibrations caused by road traffic can allow stones to shift over time. An arch will constantly apply pressure to the sides and downwards, so anytime a space is created by vibration on the sides the arch will shift to fill the gaps. As the stones move, the structure will eventually become unstable and collapse.

Many&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Unsupported attributions|who?]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;attribute the decay to low pitch [[Oscillation|vibrations]] produced by late 19th Century pipe [[Organ (music)|organs]], the proliferation of the 32 foot pipe particularly responsible, although some&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Unsupported attributions|who?]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;blame the vibrations from inner [[city]] [[traffic]]. The [[Rock (geology)|stone]] becomes crumbly, producing a fine powdered stone. Also, large sections loosen and often fall off, creating another [[hazard]]. 

=== Design Flaws ===
Arches that lack adequate support on the sides will slump and fail. All arches convert some of the weight of the structure into a horizontal outwards thrust. The structure may be stable for a time, but the arch will push the walls around it outwards continuously. This is prevented by proper engineering. Arches can be supported by a buttress on the outer wall, thick, heavy wall construction between the arch and the corner, or by using arches in a series so that each arch is opposed by two others on its sides.

== Prevention ==
The bald arch condition can be prevented by taking precautions during the construction phase and by properly maintaining the stonework over time. Ground movement can be avoided by using a solid foundation. Removing vegetation from near the foundation and preventing animals from burrowing will help to keep the foundation stable.

Frost damage can be reduced by ensuring drainage around the building and by keeping the roof in good condition. This will keep water from saturating the stone and cracking it during cold weather. Keeping water off of the stone will also prevent salt and acid rain damage. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to keep the rainwater off the walls. Paint can be applied to the stones to protect them from rain and pollution, but this is often rejected because it alters the appearance of historic buildings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;Cleaning the stone regularly can help to reduce the effects of chemical weathering.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;Pollutants accumulate on the exterior surfaces of the stone. They react with the stone and degrade the outer portions. This will degrade the appearance pf the stone and eventually weaken it to the point of failure. The most popular methods are scrubbing with fresh water or steam cleaning. This is very expensive and time consuming for a large building. It may be impossible to treat the entire building in one season, and scaffoldings will need to be erected to reach the higher parts. 

== Restoration ==
It is often desirable to preserve an arch because they are common in historic and monumental architecture. Numerous methods are employed for restoring or preserving degraded arches. The first stage in restoring an arch is to evaluate the structure to determine how serious the damage is and what technique is best suited for repair. An architect or engineer will measure the rate of deformation over some period of time, to see how fast the arch is degrading. The deformation could have occurred immediately after construction during the settling period. If that is the case, it is less urgent to repair the damage. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The goal of the restoration is an important consideration. If the goal is only to prevent further deterioration, there will be less work than if the goal is to restore the original condition.

=== Shoring ===
An arch may be shored up by adding new materials to the structure. The mode of failure determines how the arch should be reinforced. The most common failure for arches is an outwards movement of stones near the top. An arch will constantly apply pressure sideways, so the outwards pressure must be managed. If the arch is failing sideways, a buttress can be built to contain the lateral thrust. Steel tensioning rods can take the place of an external buttress to maintain the original appearance in some cases.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Removing any stone from an arch without preparing the entire arch will cause it to fail. The arch must be supported before any work can be done. This is done with a falsework of wooden trusses, similar to how the arch is initially built. The entire arch is supported by the wooden falsework. Individual stones can then be removed and repaired or replaced. Repointing or grouting the joints between stones can greatly improve the integrity of the structure. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;If the arch has slumped it can be shored up using a hydraulic jack, and then the stones can be pushed into place and repointed. This can be a very demanding job, since any structures supported by the arch will need to be supported while the arch is repaired. 

The arches can be also be reinforced using steel trusses. Some opponents believe that this degrades the appearance of the arches, that it makes them look like [[Dental brace|dental braces]]. Without this support, the building would be structurally unsound.

== Examples ==
On Wednesday, 14 March 2003, the church of [[Ælfwold II (Bishop of Sherborne)|St Ælfwold]] in the village of [[Ramsbury]] in England was closed temporarily while the masonry was reinforced with steel braces. An example of the damaged stonework is on display in the shop and has been made into a [[box]] for donations.

'''Benedetto Antelami''' (c. 1150 – c. 1230)&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;"Antelami, Benedetto" in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica|The New Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Chicago: [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]], 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Italy|Italian]] architect and [[sculpture|sculptor]] of the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] school, whose "sculptural style sprang from local north Italian traditions that can be traced back to [[late antiquity]]"&lt;ref&gt;Florens Deuchler, "Introducing Nicholas of Verdun", ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'' New Series, '''28'''.6 (February 1970, pp. 229-231), p 230.&lt;/ref&gt;   Little is known about his life. He was probably originally from [[Lombardy]], perhaps born in [[Val d'Intelvi]]. It is believed from the [[Provence|Provençal]] style of his art that he served as apprentice at  [[Saint-Trophime d'Arles]]. In 1178 he was at work at the [[Parma Cathedral]], where, in the right [[transept]], he executed a [[bas-relief]] of the [[Stations of the Cross|Deposition]] from the Cross. His name and the date are inscribed in the work, which, in addition to the Provençal element, shows both [[Classical antiquity|classical]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] influence.

Later, in 1196, he was working with the sculptural decoration of the [[Baptistry of Parma]], a building of which he was probably also the architect. Here, between 1196 and 1214, he made the [[lunette]]s of the three portals: on the outside portraying the [[Adoration of the Magi in Art|Adoration of the Magi]], the [[Last Judgement]] and an [[allegory]] of life, on the inside the [[Flight into Egypt]], the [[Presentation at the Temple]] and [[David]] playing the harp. Also on the interiori can be seen [[alto-relievo]] personifications of the months and the seasons. These were probably intended for a portal on the facade of the Cathedral, but the work was interrupted by Antelami’s death.

Benedetto's sculpture is also to be found in the [[Fidenza Cathedral]], dedicated to Saint [[Domninus of Fidenza]].

The main west door of the [[Basilica di San Marco (Venice)|Basilica di San Marco]], Venice, is also attributed by some to Antelami or his school, and the current replacement version of the [[Holy Face of Lucca]] (the ''Volto Santo'') is ascribed to his circle.

Antelami's works are characteristic for their realism, and strong emotion, within the formalist context of their time.

'''Book trimming''' is the stage of the [[book]] production process in which the [[Page (paper)|page]] edges of a book are trimmed so that all pages will stack with perfect edge alignment within the finished book jacket.

The step before book trimming is the [[book binding|binding]] of the folded printing sheets. Trimming is performed either with a hydraulic book trimmer that is able to cut a whole book in one or two passes or, until the invention of hydraulic book trimmers, with a cutting press (or lying press) and [[Plough (bookbinding)|plough]].

==Cutting principles==

===Knife cut principle===
The book cutting machine works with three knives and use the knife cut principle. The knife cut principle operates with only one knife per edge which cuts against a rubber surface. This surface supported the cut force. The three-knife-trim is performed in one step. The block is aligned and fixed by the pressure bar. The three knives cut all edges but except the spine; new machines need only one step.

===Shear cut principle===
The shear cut principle works with two knives – upper and bottom knife. The bottom knife is fixed and the upper knife works against the fixed one. Example of the shear cut principle is the cut of the paper web in the web offset machine and this is realized by a circular blade. To cut simple brochures (booklets) is used by a trimmer which works in two steps.

===Burst cut===
The third principle is the burst cut. This knife does not need a counter-acting tool. The required cut force is generated by the clamping force of the clamped paper. &lt;ref&gt;Kipphan, H. 2001. ''Handbook of print media: technologies and production methods'', Vol. 1, p. 784.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Coronation of the Virgin''''' is a painting of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] by the Italian early Renaissance painter [[Fra Angelico]], executed around 1432. It is now in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] of [[Florence]]. The artist executed another ''[[Coronation of the Virgin (Fra Angelico, Louvre)|Coronation of the Virgin]]'' (c. 1434-1435), now in the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]].

==History==
The work is mentioned as by Fra Angelico in a manuscript of the Biblioteca Nazionale di Firenze,&lt;ref&gt;Cod. Magliabe., XVII,  17&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Giorgio Vasari]] writes that it was located in the church of Sant'Egidio at Florence. Two panels of the [[predella]] which once was part of the work are known: they portray the ''Marriage'' and the ''Funeral of the Virgin'', and are currently exhibited in the museum of [[San Marco, Florence]].
[[File:Amgelico, matrimonio della vergine, 19x50, predella dell'incoronazione della vergine.jpg|thumb|left|320px|Detail of the predella with the ''Marriage of the Virgin''.]]

The altarpiece arrived at the Uffizi in 1825. The current frame dates to this period.

==Description==
The painting has a gilded background, a heritage of medieval painting, over which is a small paradise where the Coronation is being held.

It portrays Christ crowning the Virgin; both are surrounded by rays (executed through an engraving technique above the gilded background) which symbolize the divine light. The painting has a mystic tone found in other Fra Angelico works, with a large crowd of saints, angels and blessed figures enhancing this aspect. On the left, in the foreground, is St. Egidius, titular of the church which originally housed the work. His face is perhaps modelled over that [[Antonino Pierozzi]], the former prior of the  convent of San Marco, to which Fra Angelico belonged. He is followed by [[Zenobius of Florence]], St. Francis and St. Dominic. On the right side are female saints: among them is a kneeling [[Mary Magdalene]]. In the last rows are musician [[angel]]s. 

The structure of the work and the use of brilliant colors shows the influence of Angelico's master, [[Lorenzo Monaco]], who executed another ''[[Coronation of the Virgin (Lorenzo Monaco)|Coronation of the Virgin]]'', also in the Uffizi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4307">'''Corridart''' (occasionally, though incorrectly, stylized as Corrid'Art) was an almost 6-km-long public exhibit of monumental installation artwork that took place in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada on [[Sherbrooke Street]] for about six days in the summer of 1976. It was intended to be the principal arts and cultural component of the [[1976 Summer Olympics]], but was destroyed illegally on the direct order of the city's executive council, itself having been told to do so by then mayor [[Jean Drapeau]]. The exhibit showcased approximately 60 artists, and the collective efforts of hundreds more in the creation of 16 installations, with additional stages at two points along the street to host hundreds of performances throughout the duration of the games. It was considered an act of outright [[censorship]] at the time and by some measures may stand as the single largest episode of artistic censorship in [[Censorship in Canada|Canadian history]].

Corridart included artworks that engaged with the history of [[Montreal]] as well as the social and economic problems that were then current within the city, province, country and world, reflecting the difficulties in striking a societal balance between increasing [[globalization]] and the desire for a national [[Quebec nationalism|identity]]. Sherbrooke Street was chosen because it provided the most direct link between the urban core and the Olympic Park in the East End of Montreal, but also because it is a symbolic street in the city's history, acting as both the dividing line between rich and poor (especially before the mid-20th century), while simultaneously uniting multiple communities across two thirds of the island. Moreover, it was a street caught in the middle of Montreal's metamorphosis, as the artists were additionally commenting on the Drapeau administration's approval of the demolition of many heritage properties on that storied street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives3.concordia.ca/P119 Concordia University Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately Corridart never officially opened to the public. In a controversial decision, Mayor [[Jean Drapeau]] had the entire exhibit torn down on July 13, two days before the Olympic games began.&lt;ref name=Curran&gt;{{cite news|last=Curran|first=Peggy|title=Melvin Charney: A towering figure in Montreal architecture|url=https://montrealgazette.com/travel/towering+figure+Montreal+architecture/7268289/story.html|accessdate=22 September 2012|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noakes|first1=Taylor C.|title=The Mayor Who Wouldn't Let Art Ruin His Olympics|url=http://www.citylab.com/politics/2016/11/the-mayor-who-wouldnt-let-art-ruin-his-olympics/509102/|website=[[The Atlantic#CityLab|Citylab]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Media]]|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the works were destroyed beyond repair or recognition, leading to a legal battle that lasted for ten years and saw very little compensation awarded to the artists. The total cost in 1976 dollars for the project was a scant $386,000 (about $1.6 million in 2017 Canadian dollars), and it was considered an expensive mistake by city officials who ironically masterminded the most costly Olympiad of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canadianart.ca/features/11-2/ Canadian Art: interview with Melvin Charney]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2001, the Leonard &amp; Bina Ellen Art Gallery at [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]] honored Corridart by presenting an exhibition for the 25th anniversary of its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ellengallery.concordia.ca/oldSite/archive/july2001.html Corridart revisited at Leonard &amp; Bina Ellen Art Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706173454/http://ellengallery.concordia.ca/oldSite/archive/july2001.html |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schulze was forced to give up mosaic-making, when a [[Spinal cord injury|spinal injury]] forced him into [[Retirement|early retirement]]. In 1965, Schulze and Unger created a large mosaic of the crucifixion for St Jude's Catholic church in [[Wigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjude-wigan.org.uk/ |title=Saint Jude's Catholic Church, Wigan, Lancashire, England ‘Christ on the Cross’ – Unger/Eber |publisher=Stjude-wigan.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1962 and 1970, Schulze designed several posters for [[London Transport Board|London Transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ltmcollection.org/posters/artist/artist.html?IXartist=Eberhard+Schulze |title=Artist: Eberhard Schulze - Poster and poster artwork collection |publisher=London Transport Museum |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to develop a successful career as a specialist aquarist, becoming England’s leading [[Discus (fish)|discus fish]] breeder. He has written a book on discus fish called ''Discus Fish - The King of all Aquarium Fish''.

He now lives in [[Nonthaburi (city)|Nonthaburi]] in Thailand.

'''Eva Hesse''' (January 11, 1936 – May 29, 1970), was a German-born American sculptor, known for her pioneering work in materials such as [[latex]], [[fiberglass]], and plastics. She is one of the artists who ushered in the [[postminimal]] art movement in the 1960s. &lt;!-- Citation still needed for exact birth and death date--&gt;

==Life==
Hesse was born into a family of [[Judaism|observant Jews]] in [[Hamburg]], Germany, on January 11, 1936.&lt;ref name="EWB3657"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Biography|year=2004|publisher=Gale|location=Detroit|pages=365–367|edition=2nd|ref=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SFMOMA exhibit notes, 2002 for Hamburg; Danto 2006, p.32 for family being observant Jews.&lt;/ref&gt; When Hesse was two years old in December 1938, her parents, hoping to flee from [[Nazi Germany]], sent Hesse and her older sister, Helen Hesse Charash, to the Netherlands to escape Nazi Germany, aboard one of the last [[Kindertransport]] trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sutton|first1=Benjamin|title=Finally, a Documentary About Eva Hesse’s Life and Work|url=https://hyperallergic.com/207327/finally-a-documentary-about-eva-hesses-life-and-work/|website=hyperallergic|publisher=hyperallergic|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Corby, {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GpKjAQFlBI8C&amp;pg=PA133|title=Eva Hesse: Longing, Belonging and Displacement|pages=133–37|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After almost six months of separation, the reunited family moved to England and then, in 1939, emigrated to New York City,&lt;ref&gt;Lippard 1992, p. 6  and in the Chronology: THE ARTIST'S LIFE, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; where they settled into [[Manhattan]]'s [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]].&lt;ref name=Danto-32&gt;Danto 2006, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lippard 1992, p. 6"&gt;Lippard 1992, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Hesse's parents separated; her father remarried in 1945 and her mother committed suicide in 1946.&lt;ref name="Lippard 1992, p. 6"/&gt; In 1962, she met and married sculptor Tom Doyle (1928 - 2016); they divorced in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Biography Vol. 7|date=2004|publisher=Gale|location=Detroit|pages=365–367|edition=2nd|ref=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1969, she was diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]], and she died on Friday, May 29, 1970. Her death, after three operations within a year,&lt;ref name="Eva Hesse"&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/787 Eva Hesse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029204609/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/787 |date=2013-10-29 }} [[Solomon R.

==Career==
Hesse graduated from New York's [[School of Industrial Art]] at the age of 16, and in 1952 she enrolled in the [[Pratt Institute]] of Design. She dropped out only a year later.&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt; When Hesse was 18, she interned at ''Seventeen'' magazine. During this time she also took classes at the [[Art Students League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-hesse-eva.htm|title=The Art Story|website=The Art Story|access-date=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1954-57 she studied at [[Cooper Union]] and in 1959 she received her BA from Yale University.&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt; While at Yale, Hesse studied under [[Josef Albers]] and was heavily influenced by [[Abstract Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFMOMA&gt;SFMOMA exhibit notes, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tate.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Josef Albers, Eva Hesse, and the Imperative of Teaching  {{!}} Tate|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/07/josef-albers-eva-hesse-and-the-imperative-of-teaching|website=www.tate.org.uk|accessdate=11 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Yale, Hesse returned to New York, where she became friends with many other young minimalist artists, including [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nemser|first1=Cindy|title=My Memories of Eva Hesse|journal=Woman's Art Journal|date=2007|volume=28|issue=Spring-Summer|page=27|publisher=Old City Publishing, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her close friendship with Sol LeWitt continued until the end of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blantonmuseum.org/exhibitions/details/2286|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2014-08-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817124820/http://blantonmuseum.org/exhibitions/details/2286|archivedate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two frequently wrote to one another, and in 1965 LeWitt famously counseled a young doubting Eva to "Stop [thinking] and just DO!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S+ Stimulant: Sol LeWitt's advice to Eva Hessa Hesse|url=http://magazine.seymourprojects.com/2013/02/s-stimulant-sol-lewitts-advice-to-eva-hesse/|website=Seymour Magazine|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hesse and LeWitt went on to become influential artists, and their friendship aided in the artistic development of each of their works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Samantha|title=Converging Lines: Eva Hesse and Sol LeWitt|url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2014/04/art_books/converging-lines-eva-hesse-and-sol-lewitt|website=The Brooklyn Rail Critical Perspectives on Arts, Politics, and Culture|publisher=Yale University Press|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Eva Hesse married fellow sculptor Tom Doyle, and in 1965, the two moved to Germany so that Doyle could pursue an artist residency from German industrialist and collector Friedrich Arnhard Scheidt.&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt; Hesse and Doyle, whose marriage was falling apart,&lt;ref&gt;Lippard 1992, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; lived and worked in an abandoned textile mill in the [[Ruhr Area|Ruhr]] region of Germany for about a year. Hesse was not happy to be back in Germany,&lt;ref name="Lippard 1992, p. 24"&gt;Lippard 1992, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; but began working with materials that had been left behind in the abandoned factory. Their studio was set up in a disused part of Friedrich Arnhard Scheidt's textile factory in [[Kettwig|Kettwig-on-the-Ruhr]] near [[Essen]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The building still contained machine parts, tools, and materials from its previous use and the angular forms of these disused machines and tools served as inspiration for Hesse’s mechanical drawings and paintings.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  Her first sculpture was a relief titled'' Ring Around Arosie'' featured cloth-covered cord, electrical wire, and [[masonite]].&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt; This year in Germany marked a turning point in Hesse's career. From this point on she would continue to make sculptures, which became the primary focus of her work. Returning to New York City in 1965, she began working and experimenting with the unconventional materials that would become characteristic of her work: [[latex]], [[fiberglass]], and plastic.&lt;ref name="tate.org.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartscouncil.org/artists/eva-hesse/|title=Eva Hesse - The Arts Council|website=The Arts Council|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods, materials, and processes==
Hesse's early work (1960–65) consisted of abstract drawings and paintings.&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt; She is most well known for her sculptures and because of this, her drawings are often regarded as preliminary steps to her later work.&lt;ref name="Corby12"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corby|first1=Vanessa|title=New Encounters: Arts, Cultures, Concepts: Eva Hesse: Longing, Belonging and Displacement|date=2010|publisher=Tauris|location=London|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She created her drawings as a separate body of work. She states, "They were related because they were mine but they weren’t related in one completing the other."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corby|first1=Vanessa|title=New Encounters: Arts, Cultures, Concepts: Eva Hesse: Longing, Belonging, and Displacement|date=2010|publisher=Tauris|location=London, UK|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hesse’s interest in latex as a medium for sculptural forms had to do with immediacy. Keats states, "immediacy may be one of the prime reasons Hesse was attracted to latex".&lt;ref name="Mar 2011"/&gt; Hesse’s first two works using latex, ''Schema'' and ''Sequel'' (1967–68) use latex in a way never imagined by the manufacturer. "Industrial latex was meant for casting. Hesse handled it like house paint, brushing layer upon layer to build up a surface that was smooth yet irregular, ragged at the edges like deckled paper." &lt;ref name="Mar 2011"/&gt;

Hesse's work often employs multiple forms of similar shape organized together in grid structures or clusters. Retaining some of the defining forms of minimalism, modularity, and unconventional materials, she created eccentric work that was repetitive and labor-intensive. Her work "Contingent" from 1968 is an ideal example of this concept. In a statement of her work, Hesse describes her piece titled ''Hang-Up'', "It was the first time my idea of absurdity or extreme feeling came through...The whole thing is absolutely rigid, neat cord around the entire thing . . . It is extreme and that is why I like it and don't like it . . . It is the most ridiculous structure that I ever made and that is why it is really good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Irving|title=Art of The Postmodern Era|date=1996|publisher=HarperCollins|location=NY|isbn=0-06-438509-4|page=29|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postminimalism and feminism==
Eva Hesse is associated with the [[postminimal]] [[art movement]]; one of the first artists who moved from [[minimalism]] to [[postminimalism]]. [[Arthur Danto]] distinguished post-minimalism from minimalism by its "mirth and jokiness" and "unmistakable whiff of eroticism," its "nonmechanical repetition".&lt;ref name=Danto-33&gt;Danto, 2006, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

She worked and sometimes competed with her male counterparts in post-minimalist art, a primarily male-dominated movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stoops|first1=Susan|title=More Than Minimal: Feminism and Abstraction in the 70's|year=1996|publisher=Brandeis University|location=Waltham, MA|pages=54–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many feminist art historians have noted her work successfully illuminates women’s issues while refraining from any obvious political agenda. She revealed, in a letter to Ethelyn Honig (1965), that a woman is "at disadvantage from the beginning… She lacks conviction that she has the ‘right’ to achievement. She also lacks the belief that her achievements are worthy”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art|last=Stiles|first=Kristine|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|location=Berkeley, CA|page=705}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to explain that, “a fantastic strength is necessary and courage. I dwell on this all the time. My determination and will are strong but I am lacking so in self-esteem that I never seem to overcome”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She denied her work was strictly feminist, defending it as feminine but without feminist statements in mind. In an interview with Cindy Nemser for ''Woman's Art Journal'' (1970), she states, "Excellence has no sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nemser|first1=Cindy|title=My Memories of Eva Hesse|journal=Woman's Art Journal|date=2007|volume=28|issue=1|page=27|publisher=Old City Publishing, Inc.|jstor=20358108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual and critical analysis==
Hesse's work often shows minimal physical manipulation of a material while simultaneously completely transforming the meaning it conveys. This simplicity and complexity has evoked controversy among art historians. Debate has focussed pieces are to be considered complete and finished works, and which are studies, sketches, or models for future works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwabsky|first1=Barry|title=Eva Hesse|journal=Artforum|date=2010|issue=April|pages=205–206|publisher=Camden Arts Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hesse's drawings have been noted as precursory drafts to later sculptures, but Hesse herself disavowed any strong connection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her work is often described as anti-form, a term that describes the resistance to uniformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danto|first1=Arthur|title=All About Eva|journal=The Nation|date=2006|volume=24|issue=July|pages=30–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work embodies elements of minimalism in its simple shapes, delicate lines, and limited color palette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fer|first1=Briony|title=Bordering on Blank: Eva Hesse and Minimalism|date=1994|volume=17|issue=3|pages=424–449|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|location=Oxford|issn=0141-6790|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8365.1994.tb00586.x|journal=Art History}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Schwabsky]] described her work for the Camden Arts Centre in London, "Things folded, things piled, things twisted, things wound and unwound; tangled things, blunt things to connect to; materials that have a congealed look, materials that seem lost or discarded or mistreated; shapes that look like they should have been made of flesh and shapes, that look like they might be made of flesh but should not have been – you can look at these things, these materials, these shapes, and feel the shudder of an unnamable nanosensation, or you can let your eye pass by them without reaction; maybe you can do both at once."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwabsky|first1=Barry|title=Eva Hesse|journal=Artforum|date=2010|issue=April|page=206|publisher=Camden Arts Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of her work, and especially her drawings, are based on repetition and simple progressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Ellen|title=Eva Hesse|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hesse-untitled-t04151|website=Tate Britain|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation of artworks==
Eva Hesse’s sculptures have been the subject of debate during attempts to understand how to preserve the pieces that have been deteriorating with the passage of time. Except for fiberglass, most of her favored materials age badly, so much of her work presents conservators with an enormous challenge. [[Arthur Danto]], writing of the Jewish Museum's 2006 retrospective, refers to "the discolorations, the slackness in the membrane-like latex, the palpable aging of the material… Yet, somehow the work does not feel tragic. Instead, it is full of life, of eros, even of comedy… Each piece in the show vibrates with originality and mischief."&lt;ref&gt;Danto, 2006, p.30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, her work is damaged beyond presentation. For instance, ''Sans III'' can no longer be exhibited to the public because the latex boxes have curled in on themselves and crumbled. Hesse’s close friend [[Sol LeWitt]] argued for steps for active conservation, "She wanted her work to last ... She certainly didn't have the attitude that she would mutely sit by and let it disintegrate before her eyes."&lt;ref name="Mar 2011"&gt;Keats, John. "The Afterlife of Eva Hesse." Art &amp; Antiques Magazine. Art &amp; Antiques Magazine, March 31, 2011; accessed March 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; LeWitt's response is supported by many of Hesse’s other friends and colleagues. However, Hesse’s dedication to material and process contradicts her intention for these works to attain permanency. When discussing this topic with collectors in mind, she wrote, "At this point, I feel a little guilty when people want to buy it. I think they know but I want to write them a letter and say it's not going to last. I am not sure what my stand on lasting really is. Part of me feels that it’s superfluous and if I need to use rubber that is more important. Life doesn’t last; art doesn't last."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danto|first1=Arthur|title=All About Eva|journal=The Nation|date=2006|volume=17|issue=24|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Her art is often viewed in the context of the many struggles of her life. This includes escaping from the Nazis, her parents' divorce, the suicide of her mother when she was 10, her failed marriage, and the death of her father. A 2016 documentary entitled ''Eva Hesse'', premiered in New York, illustrated her painful background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/news/shoot/portrait-artist-young-woman-documenting-innovation-and-influence-eva-hesse/614744|title=Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman: Documenting the Innovation and Influence of Eva Hesse|last=Wolfe|first=Jennifer|date=2016-06-27|publisher=Creative Planet Network|accessdate=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by Marcie Begleiter, the film tells the story of Hesse's "tragically foreshortened life". It "focuses on those years of artistic emergence, a period of rapid development and furious productivity, with few parallels in the history of art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/movies/review-eva-hesse-documentary.html|title=Review: 'Eva Hesse' Offers a Moving Portrait of an Artist's Brief Life|last=Scott|first=A.O.|date=2016-04-26|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While experiences no doubt had profound impressions on Hesse, the true impact of her artwork has been her formal, artistic invention. For example, her inventive uses of material, her contemporary response to the [[minimalist]] movement, and her ability to usher in the postmodern and postminimalist art movements. Arthur Dano connects the two by describing her as "cop[ing] with emotional chaos by reinventing sculpture through aesthetic insubordination, playing with worthless material amid the industrial ruins of a defeated nation that, only two decades earlier, would have murdered her without a second thought."&lt;ref name=Danto-33/&gt;

Hesse was among the first artists of the 1960s to experiment with the fluid contours of the organic world of nature, as well as the simplest of artistic gestures. Some observers see in these qualities latent, proto-feminist references to the female body; others find in Hesse's languid forms expressions of wit, whimsy, and a sense of spontaneous invention with casually found, or "everyday" materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-hesse-eva.htm|title=Eva Hesse Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|work=The Art Story|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent artists that have noted her as a primary influence include Japanese artist [[Eiji Sumi]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/292461/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
In 1961, Hesse's gouache paintings were exhibited in Brooklyn Museum’s 21st International Watercolor Biennial. Simultaneously, she showed her drawings in the John Heller Gallery exhibition Drawings: Three Young Americans.&lt;ref name="Corby12"/&gt; In August 1962, she and Tom Doyle participated in an [[Allan Kaprow]] [[Happening]] at the [[Art Students League of New York]] in [[Woodstock, New York]]. In 1963, Hesse had a one-person show of works on paper at the Allan Stone Gallery on New York's [[Upper East Side]].&lt;ref&gt;Lippard 1992, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Her first solo show of sculpture was presented at the Kunstverein für die Rheinlande und Westfalen, Düsseldorf, in 1965.&lt;ref name="Eva Hesse"/&gt; In November 1968, she exhibited her large-scale sculptures at the [[Fischbach Gallery]] in New York. The exhibition was titled ''Chain Polymers'' and was her only solo sculpture exhibition during her lifetime in the United States.&lt;ref name="Sussman and Wasserman, Preface"&gt;Sussman and Wasserman, Preface&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was pivotal in Hesse's career, securing her reputation at the time.&lt;ref name="Sussman and Wasserman, Preface"/&gt; Her large piece ''Expanded Expansion'' showed at the [[Whitney Museum]] in the 1969 exhibit "Anti-Illusion: Process/Materials".&lt;ref name=Danto-30&gt;Danto, 2006, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been dozens of major posthumous exhibitions in the United States and Europe. An early one was at The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] (1972),&lt;ref&gt;Lippard 1992, pp. 5, 128–29, 138, 180-82.&lt;/ref&gt; while In 1979, three separate iterations of an Eva Hesse retrospective were held, entitled ''Eva Hesse: Sculpture''. These exhibitions took place at the [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]] in London from May 4-June 17, 1979; the [[Kröller-Müller Museum|Kroller-Muller]] in [[Otterlo]] from June 30-August 5, 1979; and the Kestner-Gesellschaft in [[Hannover]] from August 17-September 23, 1979. One artwork featured in the exhibition was ''Aught,'' four double sheets of latex stuffed with polyethylene.&lt;ref&gt;[Artforum, Summer 1979.

The '''French Theater of Gustav III''' was a [[French language]] theater active in Sweden between 1781 and 1792. The French theater company performed both before the Swedish royal court in the theaters of the royal palaces, as well as before the Swedish public in [[Stockholm]]. It is known to have played a significant part in the education of the pioneer generation of actors at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]].

The French theater was composed in Paris by [[Jacques Marie Boutet de Monvel]] in 1781, when it was engaged by king [[Gustav III of Sweden]] to perform before the Swedish royal court. Initially, they performed exclusively for the royal court in the theaters of the royal residences, such as [[Drottningholm Palace Theatre]] and [[Confidencen]].

From 1783 onward, they also performed before the Swedish public at [[Bollhuset]]. The public performances were, in practice, normally visited exclusively by the upper classes of Stockholm, who were able to understand the French language. The French Theater appeared before the public at Bollhuset on Wednesdays and Fridays, and at the royal court whenever they were commanded to. The company were considered of high quality, and performed the latest plays from Paris.

They shared Bollhuset with the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] from 1788, but they performed separately and referred to as the "French Theater" and the "Swedish Theater" respectively. The actors of the French Theater were expected by the king to educate Swedish pupils, and many of the first generation of Swedish actors at the Royal Dramatic Theatre were students of the actors at the French Theater, such as [[Lars Hjortsberg]] and [[Fredrica Löf]].

The French Theater were dissolved after the death of Gustav III in 1792.

{{Expand French|Le Bien et le Mal (Victor Orsel)|date=July 2018}}
[[File:Le_Bien_et_le_Mal_-_Victor_Orsel_(B_376).jpg|thumb|300px]]
'''''Good and Evil''''' (French - ''Le Bien et le Mal'') is a painting by [[Victor Orsel]], begun in Rome in 1829 and completed in Paris in 1832 after several preparatory works.

It had several influences, especially from the artist's stay in Italy. The painting is divided into two halves, one showing a virtuous way of life leading a faithful person to the Kingdom of God and the other an evil way of life leading to Hell. Orsel uses religious imagery and Latin words to intensify the impact of the moral. Orsel used medieval techniques and religious themes not used by other contemporary paintings, though he combined them with Masonic elements. First exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1833, the critics noted the work for its didactic and "archaic" character. [[Théophile Gautier]] compared it to [[Orcana]], [[Pinturicchio]] and "other artists of the [[Fra Angelico|angelic]] school", whilst Le Go assessed Orsel's style as closer to that of the [[Nazarene movement|Nazarenes]]. The work's detractors emphasised the odd juxtaposition of imitation of medieval paintings with the lack of any religious sentiments - [[Auguste Jal]] called it a "profane polyptych", whilst the Protestant [[Athanase Josué Coquerel|Athanase Coquerel ''fils'']] criticised Orsel for his lack of convictions and sensibility and for his not "being followed by his faith".

'''Graeae Theatre Company''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] organisation composed of artists and managers with physical and sensory [[disabilities]]. It was founded in 1980 by [[Nabil Shaban]] and Richard Tomlinson and named after the [[Graeae]] of [[Greek mythology]].

The '''Greek New Testament''' is the original form of the books that make up the [[New Testament]] as they appeared in [[Koine Greek]], the common dialect from 300 BC to 300 AD. There are several Greek-language versions of the New Testament that approximate the original form of the New Testament books in Greek. The first published edition of the Greek New Testament was produced by [[Erasmus]] in 1516. There are multiple Greek copies of the New Testament [[Byzantine text-type]]s, used by the Greek Orthodox Church. There exist multiple copies of the New Testament ''[[Textus Receptus]]'', the basis of the King James Bible of the New Testament. 

Modern translations of the Greek New Testament are mostly based on the ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'', which is the [[Eberhard Nestle|Nestle]]-[[Kurt Aland|Aland]] versions of the Greek New Testament, currently in its 28th revision, abbreviated NA28. These versions of the Greek New Testament come primarily from the [[Alexandrian text-type]] manuscripts and fragments in place of the Byzantine or Textus Receptus Koine Greek text, in an effort begun by [[Brooke Foss Westcott]] (1825–1901) and [[Fenton Hort]] (1828–1892).

Greek text versions are used as the basis for most modern copyrighted English translations of the New Testament, with their chief foundations being:

* the New Testament text of the [[Codex Sinaiticus]], an Alexandrian text-type manuscript version of the Bible written in the 4th century in [[uncial]] letters on parchment, which lacks many passages found in the Byzantine text-type and Textus Receptus; and
* the New Testament of the [[Codex Vaticanus]] an Alexandrian text-type manuscript version of the Bible, which ends at Hebrews 9:14 and does not have many passages found in the Byzantine text-type and Textus Receptus.

Cultures from [[Prehistory|pre-history]] to modern times constructed [[dome]]d dwellings using local materials. Although it is not known when or where the first dome was created, sporadic examples of early domed structures have been discovered. Brick domes from the [[ancient Near East]] and [[Corbel arch|corbelled]] stone domes have been found from the Middle East to Western Europe. These may indicate a common source or multiple independent traditions. A variety of materials have been used, including wood, mudbrick, or fabric. Indigenous peoples around the world produce similar structures today.

== Early and indigenous domes ==
[[File:Apache Wickiup, Edward Curtis, 1903.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Photo of an Apache wigwam, by Edward S. Curtis, 1903.]]
The earliest domes were likely domed huts made from saplings, reeds, or timbers and covered with [[Thatching|thatch]], [[Sod|turf]], or skins. Materials may have transitioned to [[rammed earth]], [[mud-brick]], or more durable stone as a result of local conditions.{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=116}} The earliest discovered remains of domed constructions may be four small dwellings made of [[Mammoth]] tusks and bones. The first was found by a farmer in [[Mezhirich]], Ukraine, in 1965 while he was digging in his cellar and archaeologists unearthed three more.{{sfn|Hitchcock}} They date from 19,280 - 11,700 BC.{{sfn|Palmer|Pettitt|Bahn|2005|p=24}}

More recently, semi-subterranean dwellings of the [[Thule people]], ancestors of the [[Inuit]] who were established in the [[Northern Canada|Canadian Arctic]] by 1300 AD, were made of whalebone frames lashed together with [[Hide (skin)|hide]] straps in a [[Parabola|parabolic]] dome shape covered with hides and blocks of [[sod]] and snow.{{sfn|Levy|Dawson|2009|p=2298-9, 2301-2}} The [[igloo]], a shelter built from blocks of ice in a spiral, was used by the Inuit people. The [[wigwam]] was made by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and covered with hides or bark.{{sfn|Hosey|2012|p=138-139}}

In developing countries, domes are often less expensive alternatives to flat or sloped-roofed construction because they use less material to enclose a given volume and provide a lower rate of heat transfer due to the reduced surface area. Domes made with [[loam]] are found in Europe, Asia, and Africa, almost always using mud-bricks or [[adobe]]s. A way of building them without centering called the Persian dome technique has been used for centuries in [[Afghanistan]].{{sfn|Minke|2012|p=119, 127}} The examples of [[Beehive house|beehive domes]] at [[Harran]], Turkey, have been dated to the 19th century AD, and are similar to the [[trullo]]s of Italy.{{sfn|Sami|Özdemir|2011|p=153}} The [[Efé people]] of central Africa construct similar [[Hut (dwelling)|structures]], using leaves as shingles.{{sfn|Wilkie|Morelli|2000}} The [[Himba people]] of [[Namibia]] construct "desert igloos" of [[wattle and daub]] for use as temporary shelters at seasonal cattle camps, and as permanent homes by the poor.{{sfn|Crandall|2000|p=34-35}} Extraordinarily thin [[Musgum mud huts|domes of sun-baked clay]] 20 feet in diameter, 30 feet high, and nearly parabolic in curve, are known from [[Cameroon]].{{sfn|Creswell|1915a|p=155}}

The historical development from structures like these to more sophisticated domes is not well documented. That the dome was known to early [[Mesopotamia]] may explain the existence of domes in both [[China]] and [[Western World|the West]] in the first millennium BC.{{sfn|Hill|1996|p=69}} Another explanation, however, is that the use of the dome shape in construction did not have a single point of origin and was common in virtually all cultures long before domes were constructed with enduring materials.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=6}}

== Ancient Near East ==
[[File:Vault fig 01.gif|thumb|right|200px|Drawing of an Assyrian bas-relief from Nimrud.]]
Small domes in corbelled stone or brick over round-plan houses go back to the [[Neolithic|Neolithic period]] in the [[ancient Near East]], and served as dwellings for poorer people throughout the [[Prehistory|prehistoric period]], but domes did not play an important role in monumental architecture.{{sfn|Leick|2003|p=64}} The discoveries of [[Cylinder seal|seal]] impressions in the ancient site of [[Chogha Mish]] (c. 6800 to 3000 BC), located in the [[Susiana]] plains of [[Iran]], show the extensive use of dome structures in mud-brick and [[adobe]] buildings, likely granaries.{{sfn|Delougaz|Kantor|1996|p=131-132, 143}} Other examples of mud-brick buildings that also seemed to employ the "true" dome technique have been excavated at [[Tell Arpachiyah]], a Mesopotamian site of the [[Tell Halaf|Halaf]] (c. 6100 to 5400 BC) and [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] (ca. 5300 to 4000 BC) cultures.{{sfn|Leick|2003|p=202}} Excavations at [[Tell al-Rimah]] have revealed pitched-brick domical vaults from about 2000 BC.{{sfn|Kawami|1982|p=63}}

At the [[Sumer]]ian Royal Cemetery of [[Ur]], a "complete rubble dome built over a timber centring" was found among the chambers of the tombs for [[Meskalamdug]] and [[Puabi]], dating to around 2500 BC.{{sfn|Chant|Goodman|1999|p=23}} Set in mud mortar, it was a "true dome with pendentives rounding off the angles of the square chamber." Other small domes can be inferred from the remaining ground plans, such as one in the courtyard of [[Ur-Nammu]]'s ziggurat, and in later shrines and temples of the 14th century BC.{{sfn|Kubba|1987|p=114}} Some monumental Mesopotamian buildings of the [[Kassites|Kassite]] period are thought to have had brick domes, but the issue is unsettled due to insufficient evidence in what has survived of these structures.{{sfn|Leick|2003|p=64}}

A [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] [[Relief|bas-relief]] from [[Nineveh|Kuyunjik]] depicts domed buildings, although remains of such a structure in that ancient city have yet to be identified, perhaps due to the impermanent nature of sun-dried [[mudbrick]] construction.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=62}}{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=957}} However, because the relief depicts the Assyrian overland transport of a carved stone statue, the background buildings most likely refer to a foreign village, such as those at the foothills of the [[Mount Lebanon|Lebanese mountains]]. The relief dates to the 8th century BC, while the use of domical structures in the [[Syria]]n region may go back as far as the fourth millennium BC.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=61-62}} Likewise, domed houses at [[Shulaveri-Shomu culture|Shulaveri]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Khirokitia]], Cyprus, date back to around 6000 BC.{{sfn|Sami|Özdemir|2011|p=153}}

== Ancient Middle East and Mediterranean ==
[[File:Schatzhaus des Atreus, Querschnitt.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Drawing of the so-called [[Treasury of Atreus]] in Mycenae, Greece.]]
Ancient stone corbelled domes have been found from the Middle East to Western Europe. Corbelled beehive domes were used as granaries in [[Ancient Egypt]] from the [[First dynasty of Egypt|first dynasty]], in [[mastaba]] tombs of the [[Old Kingdom]], as pressure-relieving devices in private brick pyramids of the [[New Kingdom]], and as kilns and cellars. They have been found in brick and in stone.{{sfn|Arnold|2003}} The mastaba tombs of [[Seneb]] and of Neferi are examples.{{sfn|Leick|2003|p=64}} A model of a [[Tenth Dynasty of Egypt|10th dynasty]] house has also been found in [[Rifeh]] showing the tops of three domes just emerging through the terraced roof.{{sfn|Creswell|1915a|p=147}}

In an area straddling the borders between [[Oman]], [[UAE]], and [[Bahrain]], stone [[beehive tomb]]s built above ground called "Hafit graves", or "Mezyat graves", date to the [[Hafit period]] between 3200 and 2700 BC.{{sfn|National|2010}}{{sfn|ADACH|2012}} Similar above-ground tombs made of corbelled stone domes have been found in the [[Cataracts of the Nile|fourth cataract region]] of [[Nubia]] with dates beginning in the second millennium BC.{{sfn|Paner|Borcowski|2007|p=2, 9}} The "Nubian dome" technique of using a movable guide to lay courses of a spherical dome dates back thousands of years in [[Upper Egypt]].{{sfn|Minke|2012|p=128}}

Examples on the Mediterranean island of [[Sardinia]] have been dated to 2500 BC.{{sfn|McNeil|2002|p=883}}

[[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] free-standing tombs about 4 to 13 meters in diameter are partially preserved on the [[Messara Plain]] of Crete. Only the lowest 3 or 4 meters remain standing of structures that may have risen up to 12 meters, but they are generally agreed to have been domed and provide a developmental link between Neolithic round houses and the circular tombs of the [[Bronze Age]]. They are dated after the round houses of [[Prehistoric Cyprus#Chalcolithic|Chalcolithic western Cyprus]] and before the Mycenaean [[Beehive tomb|"tholoi"]].{{sfn|Wright|2009|p=13}}

The so-called "[[Treasury of Atreus]]", a large [[Mycenaean chamber tomb|Mycenaean tomb]] covered with a mound of earth, dates to around 1330 BC.{{sfn|McNeil|2002|p=883}} It is about 15 meters in diameter and one of several tholos tombs with corbelled domes.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012|p=303}} Others include the "[[Tomb of Clytemnestra|Treasury of Clytemnestra]]" and the "Treasury of Minyas". Such underground tombs ("treasury" was a term used by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] for the grave of a hero) flourished in Mycenaean Greece between 1500 BC and 1300 BC, increasing in diameter from about 8 meters to about 14 meters in that time.{{sfn|Wright|2009|p=179}} Smaller scale examples from this time can also be found in other parts of southern and western Europe.{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=116}} Corbelled beehive tombs over square chambers appear in [[Thrace]], the [[Crimea]], and in [[Etruria]] in the first millennium BC. Corbelling in the corners created pendentives.{{sfn|Wright|2009|p=188}}

Wooden domes were evidently used in Etruria on the Italian peninsula from [[Archaic Greece|archaic times]]. Reproductions were preserved as rock-cut Etruscan tombs produced until the Roman [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], and paintings at [[Pompeii]] show examples of them in the [[Pompeian Styles#Third Style|third style]] and later.{{sfn|Lehmann|1945|p=248-249}} Built between the eighth century and the first century BC, particularly around [[Tarquinia]] and [[Cerveteri]], thousands of examples of Etruscan domed tombs have been identified.{{sfn|Melaragno|1991|p=9}} The Etruscan "Tomb of the Diavolino" at [[Vetulonia]] is an example.{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=117}}

Wooden domes may also have been used in [[ancient Greece]], over buildings such as the [[Epidaurus|Tholos of Epidaurus]], which is typically depicted with a shallow conical roof.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=11}} Evidence for such wooden domes over round buildings in ancient Greece, if they existed, has not survived and the issue is much debated.{{sfn|Lehmann|1945|p=248}}  The [[heroon]] at [[Stymfalia|Stymphalos]] has been dated to the late [[Classical Greece|Classical]] or early [[Hellenistic period]] and has a round room preceded by a long rectilinear porch. Its layout might have been copied from Mycenaean tholos tombs and, still in use in the Roman period, it has also been suggested as an inspiration or precedent for the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome.{{sfn|Williams|2005|p=404}}{{sfn|Jones|2003|p=180}}

== Hellenistic and pre-Roman domes ==
Although they had palaces of brick and stone, the kings of [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persia]] held audiences and festivals in domical tents derived from the nomadic traditions of central Asia. They were likely similar to the [[Yurt|later tents]] of the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol Khans]]. Called "Heavens", the tents emphasized the cosmic significance of the divine ruler. They were adopted by [[Alexander the Great]] after his conquest of the empire, and the domed [[baldachin]] of Roman and Byzantine practice was presumably inspired by this association.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=81-82}}

Simple domical mausoleums existed in the [[Hellenistic period]].{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=194}} The possible use of domed ceilings in the architecture of [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]] is suggested by rock-cut tombs in [[Alexandria]] and by a poem from a third century BC [[papyrus]] that references a fountain [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] covered with a semi-dome.{{sfn|Winter|2006|p=169}}

The earliest physical evidence of a Hellenistic dome is at the [[Morgantina#North Baths|North Baths of Morgantina]] in [[Sicily]], dated to the mid third century BC. The dome measured 5.75 metres in diameter over the circular hot room of the baths. It was made of [[terracotta]] tubes partially inserted into each other and arranged in parallel arches that were then completely covered with mortar. Iron pins were used to connect some of the tubes horizontally. It is also the earliest known example of this technique of tubular vault construction. A Hellenistic bathing complex in nearby [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] may also have used domes like these to cover its circular rooms. The domes are contemporaneous with [[Archimedes]], and the technique of their construction may be related to his method of analyzing spheres as a series of parallel truncated cone segments. The ship ''[[Syracusia]]'', built for [[Hiero II of Syracuse]] and construction of which was overseen by Archimedes, included a domed library.{{sfn|Lucore|2009|p=43-53}}

In the city of [[Pergamon]], there are remains of stone [[Apse|apsidal]] semi-domes from the second century BC.{{sfn|Dodge|1984|p=285}} The earliest evidence for [[Ashlar|dressed stone]] domes with [[voussoir]]s comes from the first century BC in the region of Palestine, Syria, and southern Anatolia, the "heartland of Oriental Hellenism".{{sfn|Wright|2009|p=188}} A stone pendentive dome is known from a first century BC bath in [[Petra]].{{sfn|Bardill|2008|p=340}}

The [[Scythians]] built domed tombs, as did some [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes in a [[paraboloid]] shape.{{sfn|Melaragno|1991|p=9}} In the [[Saarland|Saar basin]] of the [[Germania|Germanic north of Europe]], the domical shape was used in wooden construction over houses, tombs, temples, and city towers, and was translated into masonry construction only after the beginning of Roman rule.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=11}}

The remains of a large domed circular hall measuring 17 meters in diameter in the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] capital city of [[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nyssa]] has been dated to perhaps the first century AD. It "shows the existence of a monumental domical tradition in Central Asia that had hitherto been unknown and which seems to have preceded Roman Imperial monuments or at least to have grown independently from them."{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=192}} It likely had a wooden dome.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=99}} The Sun Temple at [[Hatra]] appears to indicate a transition from columned halls with [[trabeated]] roofing to vaulted and domed construction in the first century AD, at least in Mesopotamia. The domed sanctuary hall of the temple was preceded by a barrel vaulted [[iwan]], a combination that would be used by the subsequent Persian [[Sasanian Empire]].{{sfn|Stronach|1976|p=623}} An account of a Parthian domed palace hall from around 100 AD in the city of Babylon can be found in the ''[[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]'' by [[Philostratus]]. The hall was used by the king for passing judgments and was decorated with a mosaic of blue stone to resemble the sky, with images of gods in gold.{{sfn|Lehmann|1945|p=250-251}} A bulbous Parthian dome can be seen in the relief sculpture of the [[Arch of Septimius Severus]] in Rome, its shape apparently due to the use of a light tent-like framework.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=82}}

'''Jack of The North''' identifies an otherwise untitled, short dialogue responding to and supporting anti-[[enclosure]] actions in [[Cambridgeshire]] in 1549, the year before [[Kett's Rebellion]]. The text is printed in [[Charles Henry Cooper]]'s ''Annals of Cambridge'', which names the source as "Dr. Lamb's Cambridge Documents". The dialogue participants are Jack of the North beyond the style, Robbyn Clowte, Tom of Trompington, Buntynge on the Hyll, Peter Potter, Pyrse Plowman, Symon Slater, Harry Clowte, Whyp Wylliam, and Hodge Hasteler. The two Clowtes and [[Piers Plowman|Pyrse Plowman]] were established poetic personnae from [[John Skelton]] and [[William Langland]]; both would later appear in the poetry of [[Edmund Spenser]].

The '''Kells Crozier''' or ''British Museum Crozier'' is a mediaeval Irish bishop's staff that has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection since 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/the_kells_crozier.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; This rare object, one of only four extant complete examples known from Ireland,  mysteriously appeared in [[London]] in 1850, before being acquired by the museum.

==Description==
The Kells Crozier was made by various craftsmen over at least two different periods between the late 9th and 11th century AD. While the core of the [[crozier]] is wooden, the crook is made of silver and the staff is covered in a copper alloy sheet which was later covered with silver mounts or knobs filled with animal interlace typical of the period. The curved crest of the crook is elaborately decorated with interlinking birds; where this meets the straight end of the crook a human head appears. This is where the crozier would have once held some holy relics. Its total length measures about 133&amp;nbsp;cm.

==History of the Crozier ==
Underneath the crest of the crook is engraved an inscription in mixed Latin and the old [[Irish language]]: "ordo conduilis ocius do mel finnen", which, roughly translated, asks supplicants to pray for Cúduilig and Maelfinnén who were involved in its refurbishment. Scholars have identified these names with individuals who were connected with the important Irish monastic settlement at [[Kells, County Meath]]. However, recent research has  cast doubts about this connection. The crozier was found without explanation in the cupboard of a London [[solicitor]]'s office in the middle of the nineteenth century. It subsequently belonged to several owners (including [[Cardinal Wiseman]]) before being purchased by the British Museum.

==Reliquary Deposit==
A key role of the Kells Crozier was to act as a repository for holy relics for the pious faithful. Enshrining items which had once belonged to saints or church leaders, such as their bones or parts of their clothing,  was an important feature of religious life in early medieval Ireland. Other reliquaries common to Ireland in this period were the bell shrines, such as [[St Patrick]]'s Bell in the [[National Museum of Ireland]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/list/ten-major-pieces.aspx?article=3a7f87c7-ee55-459d-b7c8-577becc19e15 National Museum of Ireland website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; and St Conall Cael's Bell in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/st_conall_caels_bell.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Loewenmensch2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''Löwenmensch'', a lion-headed figurine found in Germany, dating to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] of about 35,000 to 40,000 years ago]]
The '''Löwenmensch figurine''' or '''Lion-man of the Hohlenstein-Stadel''' is a prehistoric ivory [[sculpture]] that was discovered in the [[Hohlenstein-Stadel]], a German cave in 1939. The German name, '''Löwenmensch''' meaning "lion-human", is used most frequently because it was discovered and is exhibited in Germany.

The lion-headed figurine is the oldest-known [[zoomorphic]] (animal-shaped) sculpture in the world, and the oldest-known uncontested example of [[figurative art]]. It has been determined by [[carbon dating]] of the layer in which it was found to be between 35,000 and 40,000 years old, and therefore is associated with the archaeological [[Aurignacian]] culture of the Upper Paleolithic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/figur_3.html 14C dating - The age of the lion man] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; It was carved out of [[mammoth ivory]] using a [[flint]] stone knife. Seven parallel, transverse, carved gouges are on the left arm.

After several reconstructions that have incorporated newly found fragments, the figurine stands {{convert|31.1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall, {{convert|5.6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|5.9|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. It currently is displayed in the [[Ulm]] Museum, Germany.

==History==
Systematic excavations at [[Hohlenstein-Stadel]] cave began in 1937 under the direction of prehistoric historian [[:de:Robert Wetzel (Anatom)|Robert Wetzel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/entdeckung_1939.html Discovery: 1939] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of a fragmented [[mammoth]]-[[ivory]] figurine was made on 25 August 1939 by geologist [[:de:Otto Völzing|Otto Völzing]].&lt;ref name=spieg/&gt; The start of World War II just one week later, meant that the [[fieldwork]] was left incomplete and analysis of the finds was not undertaken.  The excavation trenches were backfilled with the same soil in which the ivory had been found.&lt;ref name=lobell/&gt; 

For approximately thirty years, the fragments lay forgotten at the nearby [[:de:Ulmer Museum|Museum of Ulm]]. It was not until archaeologist [[Joachim Hahn]] started an inventory and assembly of more than 200 fragments that a figurine with animal and human features began to emerge.&lt;ref name=lobell&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Life for the Lion Man|author=Jarrett A. Lobell|date= March 2012|volume= 65|issue= 2|journal=Archaeology|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1203/features/stadelhole_hohlenstein_paleolithic_lowenmensch.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wetzel continued to spend summers digging at the site until 1961,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/entdeckung_1956.html Discovery: 1956] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; and further finds of ivory were made on the cave floor in the 1970s. In 1982, paleontologist [[Elisabeth Schmid]] combined the new fragments with Hahn's reconstruction, correcting some errors and adding pieces of the nose and mouth that emphasized the figurine's feline characteristics.&lt;ref name=lobell/&gt;{{efn|[http://donsmaps.com/images29/lionmenschhhh.jpg These images] of a preliminary reconstruction from 1980 shows how much has been achieved after years of painstaking reconstruction. (Adam, K., Kurz, R., 1980 ''Eiszeitkunst im süddeutschen Raum'')}}

In 1987, a comprehensive restoration began in the workshops of the [[Landesmuseum Württemberg]] by Ute Wolf in cooperation with Schmid. During the work, which took more than six months, it was realized that the figurine was only about two-thirds complete. The back is severely damaged and the legs are missing some ivory [[Lamella (materials)|lamellae]]. The ears, eye-holes, two-thirds of the mouth and nose, and the back of the head are preserved. To fill gaps in the head and body a reversible substance consisting of a mixture of beeswax, artificial wax, and chalk was used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/entdeckung_1987.html Discovery: 1987] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2008, further excavations were carried out in the cave. All layers were sifted systematically, which led to many minute fragments being discovered. The first new adjustments were simulated virtually so that fragments could be added without having to disassemble the original recreation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/entdeckung_2011.html Discovery: 2011] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[http://donsmaps.com/images24/lionladyreconst.jpg X-ray computed tomographs of "Löwenmenschen"] After restoration 1987/88 with new fragments from the 2010 excavation (red) and free fragments from the stock of the museum (green)}}

In 2012, a second restoration was begun in the workshops of the State Office for the Preservation of Historical Monuments in Esslingen under the leadership of [[Nicole Ebinger-Rist]]. The figurine was disassembled into its individual parts and newly discovered fragments were added along with the old ones, allowing further completion of areas of the head, back, and right side of the body, and artificial additions used during the first restoration were discarded.&lt;ref name=ulmer2013/&gt; The Löwenmensch figurine grew in height from 296 to 311 millimetres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.swp.de/ulm/lokales/ulm_neu_ulm/loewenmensch-ist-gewachsen-11005726.html|author=Henning Petershagen|date=2 November 2013|title=Löwenmensch ist gewachsen|work=Südwest Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work was completed in late 2013.&lt;ref name=ulmer2013&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/entdeckung_2013.html Discovery: 2011] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[File:Loewenmensch1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The Löwenmensch figurine after restoration in 2013]]
Assignment of gender became an objective of certain researchers. Initially, the figurine was classified as male by Hahn who suggested a plate on the abdomen could be a flaccid penis. Schmid later classified this feature as a pubic triangle,&lt;ref name=spieg&gt;{{cite news|title=Puzzle im Schutt|work=Der Spiegel|author=Matthias Schulz|date=5 December 2011|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-82612721.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, and from examination of new parts of the sculpture, determined that the figurine was that of a woman with the head of a "''{{lang|de|Höhlenlöwin}}''" (female [[Panthera leo spelaea|European cave lion]]).&lt;ref name="sc"&gt;{{Cite web |first=Jochen |last=Duckeck |date=2008-12-10 |title=Arch&amp;auml;ologie: Der Löwenmensch |url=http://www.showcaves.com/german/explain/Archaeology/Loewenfrau.html |language=German |quote=Joachim Hahn hatte die Figur als männlich betrachtet. Elisabeth Schmid kam zu dem Schluß, dass es sich um die Figur einer Frau mit dem Kopf einer Höhlenlöwin handele. |accessdate=2009-05-17 |postscript=. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521210909/http://www.showcaves.com/german/explain/Archaeology/Loewenfrau.html |archive-date=2009-05-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }} and {{Cite web |first=Jochen |last=Duckeck |date=2008-12-10 |title=Archaeology: Lionheaded Figurine |url=http://www.showcaves.com/english/explain/Archaeology/Loewenfrau.html |accessdate=2009-05-17 |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Male European cave lions often lacked distinctive manes, so the absence of a mane could not determine categorically that the figurine was that of a lioness, and a debate about its gender ensued among some involved in the research and the popular press. Kurt Wehrberger of the Ulm Museum stated that the statue had become an "icon of the feminist movement".&lt;ref name=spieg/&gt; 

After the 2012–13 restoration it was realized that the triangular platelet in the genital area was processed all around separating it from the figurine. A fracture point suggests that originally it may have been square in shape. Although an objective determination of the gender of the Löwenmensch figurine is impossible, debate continues, with the most common interpretation of the fragment being a stylized male sex organ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/bedeutung4.html Importance: Sex?] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Löwenmensch figurine lay in a chamber almost 30 metres from the entrance of the Stadel cave and was accompanied by many other remarkable objects. Bone tools and worked antlers were found, along with jewellery consisting of pendants, beads, and perforated animal teeth. The chamber was probably a special place, possibly used as a storehouse or hiding-place, or maybe as an area for cultic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/bedeutung2.html Importance: Depot - hiding place - cult place?] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar but smaller lion-headed human sculpture was found along with other animal figurines and several flutes in the nearby [[Vogelherd Cave]]. This leads to the possibility that the Löwenmensch figurines were important in the [[mythology]] of humans of the early [[Upper Paleolithic]]. Archaeologist [[Nicholas Conard]] has suggested that the second lion-figurine "lends support to the hypothesis that Aurignacian people may have practised [[shamanism]] ... and that it should be considered strong evidence for fully symbolic communication and cultural modernity".&lt;ref name="CoolidgeWynn2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frederick L. Coolidge|author2=Thomas Wynn|title=The Rise of Homo sapiens: The Evolution of Modern Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pZHtlD7Ife8C&amp;pg=PT174|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5653-3|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figurine shares certain similarities with later French cave paintings, which also show hybrid creatures with human-like lower bodies and animal heads such as the "[[The Sorcerer (cave art)|Sorcerer]]" from the [[Trois Frères]] in the Pyrennes or the "[[Bison-man (cave art)|Bison-man]]" from the [[Grotte de Gabillou]] in the Dordogne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loewenmensch.de/bedeutung3.html Importance: Animal and human being] Ulm Museum (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==
The carving of the figurine from hard mammoth tusk would have been a complex and time-consuming task.{{efn|[http://donsmaps.com/images29/lioncarvinginsitu.jpg This image] shows the positioning of the figurine within the tusk. Schmid found that the groin area coincided with the apex of the tusk's [[Pulp (tooth)|pulp cavity]]. "The long axis of the figure follows the nerve canal with the head at the narrowing end. This expert positioning suggests that the make deliberately selected a portion of the tusk suitable for a preconceived work." (Cook, 2013)}}  A similarly-sized tusk found in the same cave has marks that "indicate that the skin and thin bone around the tooth cavity of the upper jaw were cut through to the surface of the tooth, which was then exposed for detachment with a hammer. The tip was harder and had to be removed by wedging and splitting."&lt;ref name=cook/&gt;

Wulf Hein and Kurt Wehrberger conducted an [[Experimental archaeology|experimental]] replication with the kinds of stone tool available at the time. Removing the base of the tusk took ten hours. The body was carved with a steep-fronted scraper; the [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s requiring regular resharpening. Several different tools were needed to separate the torso from the insides of the arms while shaping the head and shoulders, which involved difficult cutting across the grain of the ivory, often required two hands on the tool. The basic shaping took around 200 hours, and in total the recreation took more than 370 hours.{{efn|The Ulm Museum site says 360 hours, Cook (2013) says 320, whereas the video made by the team says 370+}} Jill Cook, Curator of Paleolithic collections at the British Museum, suggests that "unless the sculpture was created slowly at odd moments over several months, someone as skilled as an artist may have been excused from other subsistence tasks to work specially on this piece."&lt;ref name=cook&gt;{{cite book|author= Cook, J.|title= Ice Age art: arrival of the modern mind|publisher= The British Museum|date= 18 February 2013|isbn=978-0714123332}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his October 2017 [[BBC Radio 4]] series ''[[Living with the Gods]]'', [[Neil MacGregor]] asked Cook "[…] so why would a community living on the edge of subsistence, whose primary concerns were finding food, keeping that fire going, protecting children from predators, allow someone to spend so much time away from those tasks?", to which she replied that it was about "[…] a relationship to things unseen, to the vital forces of nature, that you need to perhaps propitiate, perhaps connect to, in order to ensure your successful life".&lt;ref name="BBC Living With The Gods"&gt;{{cite episode| title= The Beginnings of Belief| episodelink= | series= Living With The Gods | serieslink= | credits= Presenter: [[Neil MacGregor]]; Producer: Paul Kobrak| network= BBC| station= [[BBC Radio 4]]| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b099xhmj| minutes= 06:08| airdate= 23 October 2017| accessdate= 23 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduced in a [[backdoor pilot]] on the sitcom [[Girlfriends (U.S. TV series)|''Girlfriends'']] as the cousin of [[Joan Clayton]] ([[Tracee Ellis Ross]]), Melanie chooses to support her boyfriend [[Derwin Davis]]' ([[Pooch Hall]]) career with the San Diego Sabres, a fictional [[National Football League]] (NFL) team, rather than attend [[Medical school in the United States|medical school]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. The series focuses primarily on Melanie and Derwin's complicated relationship, with her fears of his [[infidelity]] at the center of many of the episodes' storylines. Mowry left the series in 2012 upon learning that her role would be reduced as a result of co-star Pooch Hall's decision to leave ''The Game'' to appear in the [[crime drama]] series ''[[Ray Donovan]]''. Both actors reprised their roles in the series' finale, in which Melanie gives birth to twins.

Melanie was created by producer [[Mara Brock Akil]]. While casting the character, Brock Akil had doubts about whether Mowry would be the best choice, given her wholesome image from starring as [[Tia Landry]] on the sitcom [[Sister, Sister (TV series)|''Sister, Sister'']], but hired the actress based on her strong work ethic and her desire to be part of the series. Mowry considered the character to be her first adult role and felt it emphasized her individuality and maturity. She identified closely with the part, observing parallels between Melanie's relationship with Derwin and her own marriage to actor [[Cory Hardrict]]. She cited ''The Game'' as an example of women receiving more lead roles on television.

Reaction to Melanie was primarily negative; [[Television criticism|critics]] expressed disapproval of her decision to support her boyfriend instead of enrolling in medical school. Media commentators also panned the character's representation as a mother, such as her inability to properly care for her stepson. On the other hand, fans responded positively to Melanie and felt drawn to her relationship with Derwin. Mowry's performance received positive feedback from critics, who agreed that the role displayed her maturity as an actress. She received nominations for two [[NAACP Image Awards]] and a [[Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice Award]] for the role.

===Portrayal and characterization===
Prior to hearing about ''The Game'', Mowry had changed her appearance in order to be perceived as more mature and to emphasize the differences between herself and her twin sister. During this process, she lost {{convert|10|lb}} and straightened her hair for auditions.&lt;ref name="Flying solo" /&gt; To prepare for the role, she frequently consulted her cousin, retired NFL [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Jameel Cook]], and other professional athletes.&lt;ref name="Real and relatable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.vcstar.com/entertainment/sisters-tia-and-tamera-mowry-make-their-acting-roles-real-and-relatable-ep-373949561-352598281.html/|title=Sisters Tia and Tamera Mowry make their acting roles real and relatable|last=Dransfeldt|first=Jeffrey|date=April 15, 2008|work=[[Ventura County Star]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804015951/http://archive.vcstar.com/entertainment/sisters-tia-and-tamera-mowry-make-their-acting-roles-real-and-relatable-ep-373949561-352598281.html/|archivedate=August 4, 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mowry felt that playing the role of Melanie would enable her to be perceived as more mature following her appearances as [[Tia Landry]] on ''Sister, Sister''. When discussing her reasons for auditioning, she said that she wanted to take on a more difficult role.&lt;ref name="Flying solo" /&gt; She also described ''The Game'' as an opportunity to showcase her individuality.&lt;ref name="identical twin" /&gt; Mowry identified Melanie as the closest match to her personality in comparison to her previous roles. She cited her character's relationship with Derwin as reminiscent of her own romance and subsequent marriage to actor [[Cory Hardrict]].&lt;ref name="Motherhood is" /&gt;

Describing Melanie as a "vixen",&lt;ref name="BookMowry"&gt;[[Melanie Barnett#Mowry2012|Mowry (2012)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mowry believes that the character's imperfections allowed her to grow as an actor.&lt;ref name="Merwin2" /&gt; She felt the show was evidence, alongside ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', that women had more leading roles on television, and said this "allows women to be women and to show their different emotions and what we deal with in life{{snd}}period".&lt;ref name="Real and relatable" /&gt; Melanie's intellect, one of her defining characteristics, earned her the nickname "Med School".&lt;ref name="End Zone" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/2015/08/derwin-melanie-the-game-finale/|title=‘The Game’ Reaches The End-Zone, Melanie and Derwin Return For Series Finale|last=Jones|first=Kathryn E.|date=August 5, 2015|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|dead-url=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804020304/https://www.vibe.com/2015/08/derwin-melanie-the-game-finale/|archivedate=August 4, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[VIBE Vixen]]'''s Jennifer Hickman referred to Melanie as "bookwormy",&lt;ref name="VIBE Vixen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=%22Melanie+Barnett%22+%22Tia%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJy-2i6bvVAhVp1oMKHRLECpAQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Melanie%20Barnett%22%20%22Tia%22&amp;f=false|title=Game Face|last=Hickman|first=Jennifer|date=August–September 2007|work=[[VIBE Vixen]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803194630/https://books.google.com/books?id=syUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=%22Melanie+Barnett%22+%22Tia%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJy-2i6bvVAhVp1oMKHRLECpAQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Melanie%20Barnett%22%20%22Tia%22&amp;f=false|archivedate=August 3, 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Virginia Heffernan characterized her as "wholesome and a good student" in the pilot.&lt;ref name="Bridging" /&gt; Heffernan called the character a "kind of [[The Cosby Show|''Cosby Show'']] figure" due to her initial reluctance to join the Sabre Sunbeams.&lt;ref name="Bridging" /&gt;

===Departure and return===
After ''The Game'' aired for three seasons on the CW, the network canceled the series, having decided to stop developing sitcoms.&lt;ref name="NoReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2009/05/21/the-cw-announce/|title=The CW announces fall schedule: 'Melrose Place' paired with '90210'|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=May 21, 2008|last=Stransky|first=Tanny|accessdate=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Picked up by BET, the show aired for five more seasons.&lt;ref name="Positive2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/changing-the-game-how-the-bet-comedy-helped-make-tv-history/2015/07/28/6245ed08-3546-11e5-94ce-834ad8f5c50e_story.html|title=‘The Game’ is over and everybody won: How BET’s comedy helped make TV history|last=Yahr|first=Emily|date=July 28, 2015|work=[[The Washington Post]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806023639/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/changing-the-game-how-the-bet-comedy-helped-make-tv-history/2015/07/28/6245ed08-3546-11e5-94ce-834ad8f5c50e_story.html?utm_term=.677ad3e5640a|archivedate=August 6, 2017|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mowry and Hall left ''The Game'' in 2012&lt;ref name="Will Return UK" /&gt; after Hall accepted a lead role in the [[crime drama]] television series ''[[Ray Donovan]]''.&lt;ref name="Finale" /&gt; Mowry left the show when Melanie's role was slated to become "less important" in comparison to previous seasons.&lt;ref name="Finale" /&gt; Announcing her departure on [[Twitter]], she emphasized that it was a mutual decision with the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/960717/actress-tia-mowry-leaving-the-game|title=Tia Mowry kisses The Game goodbye!|last=Clark|first=Krystal|date=May 17, 2012|publisher=[[SheKnows Media]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803201412/http://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/960717/actress-tia-mowry-leaving-the-game|archivedate=August 3, 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brock Akil said she provided closure to Melanie and Derwin's story arc through their exit, explaining: "They're together, and we were able to put a period on their story."&lt;ref name="Big changes" /&gt;

For the series finale, Mowry and Hall reprised their roles as Melanie and Derwin even though Mowry had written on her [[Facebook]] page that she would not reappear on the show.&lt;ref name="Will Return UK" /&gt; Hall announced their return during the [[2015 BET Awards]], where the show's cast had attended to say "their final goodbyes".&lt;ref name="Will Return BET" /&gt; Discussing the direction intended for Melanie and Derwin's final appearance, Brock Akil said: "To bring these characters back to shore is such a blessing.

==Reception==

===Response to Melanie===
Melanie Barnett has been negatively received by [[Television criticism|television critics]]. Melanie McFarland of [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer|''The Seattle Post-Intelligencer'']] panned the character along with the show's main premise ("A woman on a professional track kicks it all aside to chase a football player"), feeling that they were contradictory to the message of the parent show ''Girlfriends''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/tv/article/On-TV-A-show-to-see-and-one-to-flee-1215999.php|title=On TV: A show to see and one to flee|last=McFarland|first=Melanie|date=September 29, 2006|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|dead-url=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803224317/http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/tv/article/On-TV-A-show-to-see-and-one-to-flee-1215999.php|archivedate=August 3, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Echoing McFarland's assessment, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle|The San Francisco Chronicle]]'''s Tim Goodman found Melanie's decision to be "a bleak little life lesson".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainmen±t/article/New-season-is-another-way-to-love-Chris-but-2469088.php|title=New season is another way to love 'Chris,' but give 'Game' the boot|last=Goodman|first=Tim|date=September 28, 2006|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing the transition to BET, Britney Wilson of [[Clutch (magazine)|''Clutch'']] was critical of the deterioration of female friendships on the show, citing "the disintegration of the female identity" as signs of ''The Game''{{'s}} declining quality.&lt;ref name="End Zone" /&gt;

The character's representation as a mother also received criticism. Wilson viewed negatively Melanie's decision to have an abortion in an attempt to reconcile with Derwin, and criticized the show's depiction of an abortion causing Melanie to become barren as based on "a link that is not medically solid".&lt;ref name="End Zone" /&gt; In her 2015 book ''Representations of Black Women in the Media: The Damnation of Black Womanhood'', [[California State University, Northridge|California State University]] associate professor Marquita Marie Gammage felt that the character was perpetuating negative images of black motherhood on television. Gammage criticized the series for showing Melanie becoming a wife "at the expanse of her career and possibility of bear[ing] her own children" and portraying her as unable to care for her stepson. She contrasted Melanie to white characters on television, writing that "white women seem to achieve it all and control their realities on their own terms".&lt;ref name="BookGammage2" /&gt;

Mowry received positive feedback from fans, who "were fairly obsessed with Melanie and Derwin’s journey early on".&lt;ref name="Positive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/changing-the-game-how-the-bet-comedy-helped-make-tv-history/2015/07/28/6245ed08-3546-11e5-94ce-834ad8f5c50e_story.html|title=‘The Game’ is over and everybody won: How BET’s comedy helped make TV history|last=Yahr|first=Emily|date=July 28, 2015|work=[[The Washington Post]]|dead-url=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806023639/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/changing-the-game-how-the-bet-comedy-helped-make-tv-history/2015/07/28/6245ed08-3546-11e5-94ce-834ad8f5c50e_story.html?utm_term=.677ad3e5640a|archivedate=August 6, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans reacted positively to the characters' relationship, and dubbed the couple the [[portmanteau]] "Merwin",&lt;ref name="Merwin" /&gt; which BET adopted and used to promote Mowry and Hall's appearances in the series finale.&lt;ref name="Merwin2" /&gt; Jaime Lee of [[Soap Opera Network]] wrote that, in relating to their struggles, viewers connected with the fictional couple.&lt;ref name="Merwin" /&gt; A writer from ''[[HuffPost]]'' cited the pairing as a "big part of the winning formula for the series",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/06/the-game-finale-melanie-derwin-goodbye-video_n_1573230.html|title=‘The Game’ Finale: Melanie And Derwin Say Goodbye|date=February 11, 2015 |work=[[HuffPost]]|accessdate=August 11, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mowry attributed the positive fan response to her chemistry with Hall.&lt;ref name="Merwin2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bet.com/video/thegame/season-9/exclusives/team-merwin.html|title=The Game Exclusives: Team Merwin|date=August 5, 2015|publisher=[[BET]]|dead-url=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923110829/http://www.bet.com/video/thegame/season-9/exclusives/team-merwin.html|archivedate=September 23, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said the following about the character's reception in ''[[The Washington Post]]'':

{{quote|Through the course of playing Melanie, some people would love her, some would hate her, some would judge her[.] But I think they connected with her&amp;nbsp;– they enjoyed her vulnerability, they enjoyed relating to her. . . . It's refreshing to see a couple that's not perfect on television, a couple that works through trials and tribulations.&lt;ref name="Positive" /&gt;}}

===Response to Mowry===
Mowry's performance received positive feedback from critics. While discussing her career in his 2010 book ''Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television'', author Bob McCann wrote that Mowry demonstrated maturity through her more dramatic role in the series.&lt;ref name="Books3"&gt;[[Melanie Barnett#McCann2009|McCann (2009)]]: p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Though critical of the overall show, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''{{'s}} Maureen Ryan was pleased with Mowry's charismatic performance.&lt;ref name="Fumbles" /&gt; Melody K. Hoffman of [[Jet (magazine)|''Jet'']] wrote that, through her performance in the show, Mowry had demonstrated her love for acting and her capacity to portray a woman.&lt;ref name="Flying solo" /&gt; In a negative review, ''[[USA Today]]'''s Robert Bianco was uncertain of Mowry's capabilities as a comedic actress, saying that she frequently relied on child acting techniques that were inappropriate for an adult character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2006-09-28-review-the-game_x.htm|title='Game' garners very few points|last=Bianco|first=Robert|date=September 28, 2006|work=[[USA Today]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803223607/https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2006-09-28-review-the-game_x.htm|archivedate=August 3, 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Miracles from Heaven: A Little Girl, Her Journey to Heaven, and Her Amazing Story of Healing''''' is a memoir written by an American author Christy Beam, released on April 14, 2015. The author wrote the book about her daughter Annabel Beam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Miracles From Heaven': Near-Fatal Fall Cures Sick Little Girl's Symptoms|url=http://insider.foxnews.com/2015/04/14/miracles-heaven-near-fatal-fall-cures-sick-little-girls-symptoms|accessdate=July 20, 2015|work=foxnews.com|date=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The book is about the author's 10-year-old daughter Annabel Beam, who was diagnosed with a rare terminal stomach disorder. While on a visit home from the hospital she fell while climbing a tree with her older sister, a branch gave way sending Annabel 30 feet down headfirst into the hollow trunk of a cottonwood tree. She was inside the trunk of the tree for several hours where she visits with Jesus who tells her she will be fine. She is finally rescued and taken to a hospital. She woke up at the hospital without any broken bones or internal injuries. After this incident, she no longer felt pain due to her stomach disorder and her doctor confirmed that her rare disease was somehow miraculously cured.

[[File:Robert Campin 006.jpg|thumb|260px|''The Annunciation''. The [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Musée des Beaux-Arts]], Brussels, version of the central panel, at one time attributed to [[Jacques Daret]], a pupil of Campin's. This panel was painted earlier than the New York version, and may be the original.&lt;ref name="r50"&gt;Reuterswärd (1998), 50&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Mérode Altarpiece'''{{efn-ua|The triptych is named after a previous owner, comtesse Marie-Nicolette de Merode (1849–1905)}} (or '''''Annunciation Triptych''''') is an [[Oil painting|oil]] on oak panel [[triptych]], now in [[The Cloisters]], in New York City. It is unsigned and undated, but attributed to [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painter]] [[Robert Campin]] and an assistant.{{efn-ua|The painting is attributed by the Metropolitan Museum of Art to "Robert Campin and assistant". The "assistant" is attributed with the figure of the female donor, rather than the main subjects}} The three panels represent, from left to right, the [[votive portrait|donors]] kneeling in prayer in a garden, the moment of the [[Annunciation]] to Mary, which is set in a contemporary, domestic setting, and [[Saint Joseph]], a carpenter with the tools of his trade. The many elements of religious symbolism include the lily and fountain (symbolising the purity of Mary), and the [[Holy Spirit]] represented by the rays of light coming falling from the left hand window.

The central panel was completed after 1422, likely between 1425 and 1428, by a member of Campin's workshop.{{efn-ua|Dates as early as 1420 have been suggested, based on Campin presumed birth date and that [[Jan van Eyck]]'s [[Ghent altarpiece]] "Annunciation" was influenced by Campin's treatment of the same subject. See Rousseau (1957), 128}}  The outer panels are later additions by a workshop member, probably on request by the donor who sought to elevate the central panel to a triptych and place himself in the pictorial space. The wings contain views of the city of [[Liège]], in today's Belgium. A version of the center panel in Brussels is earlier, and maybe Campin's original panel.

The triptych is a founding and important work in the then emerging late Gothic, [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] style, and has been described as a "milestone between two periods; it at once summarizes the medieval tradition and lays the foundation for the development of modern painting".&lt;ref name="r117"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating and attribution==
The New York triptych has been at times attributed to the young [[Rogier van der Weyden]]&lt;ref name="r117" /&gt; It is today accepted as belonging to a group of paintings associated with the Master of Flémalle, assumed to be Robert Campin,{{efn-ua|Until the connection had been made, Campin was associated with a separate grouping of works. See Campbell (1998), 72}} a mentor of [[Jan van Eyck]].&lt;ref name="dg130" /&gt; There is another version of the Annunciation panel in [[Brussels]], slightly earlier but damaged,&lt;ref name="c643"&gt;Campbell (1974), 643&lt;/ref&gt; which may represent the original version by Campin.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;

Technical examination of the wood panels suggest that the New York triptych was completed by a number of hands. The wood of the central panel is different and earlier to that of the wings, while the hinging further suggest that the central panel was not intended as part of a triptych. The central panel is likely a copy of an earlier composition by Campin, while the wings were probably a later commissioned by the donor, who presumably wished that they were attached to the main panel to form a devotional altarpiece, probably (given its size) for private devotion.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt; Areas of the panels have been reworked; both the female doner and bearded man on the left wing were painted over landscape, while the window behind the Virgin was originally painted in gold.&lt;ref name="s140"&gt;Suhr, 140-44&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Campbell]] has dismissed the triptych's association with the Flemalle group, and thus Robert Campin. He describes the Mérode as "incoherent in design", in that it lacks spatial continuity between the panels, a trait most noticeable in the ''[[Seilern Triptych]]''.&lt;ref name="c643" /&gt; In addition the open sky seen through the windows in the central is incongruous in point of view with the street scene in the donor panel. He further notes the poor command of perspective in the donor panel, and notes that it is "unfortunate that a line of one of the mortar courses in the garden wall disappear into the donor's mouth".&lt;ref name="c644" /&gt; Campbell disregards the wing panels as pedestrian and by lesser hands, thrown together at the will of the donor. He gives prominence to the Brussels panel, which he cautiously attributes to the Master of Flémalle.&lt;ref name="c643" /&gt;

==Description==
The triptych was commissioned for private and domestic use; the central panel is a relatively small 64 × 63&amp;nbsp;cm and each wing measures 65 × 27&amp;nbsp;cm. Each panel has a steep perspective, in that the viewer seems to be looking down on the figures from an elevated point of view. In other respects the perspective is underdeveloped; neither the Virgin nor Gabriel seem to rest on solid ground, while the female donor seems to hover, and  barely able to fit into the space she is positioned in.&lt;ref name="r124"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The panels are well preserved, with little over-paint, glossing, dirt layers or paint losses.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/470304 Annunciation Triptych (Merode Altarpiece)]". [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved 17 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; They are almost entirely in oil; and establish many of the inventions that were to make the technique so successful and adaptable over the following centuries.&lt;ref name="r121"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 121&lt;/ref&gt; The serenity of the works is achieved, in part, through the dominance of pale, opaque white, red and blue hues. The panels are relatively small; the at times minute attention to detail calls to mind the focus of contemporary miniatures, of the kind seem in the two [[illuminated manuscripts]] in the central panel.&lt;ref name="r121" /&gt;

===Annunciation===
[[File:Annunciation Triptych (Merode Altarpiece) MET DT7255.jpg|thumb|260px|Detail, center panel, with table, book of hours, fading candle and vase]]
The panel is one of the earliest representations of the [[Annunciation to Mary]] in a contemporary middle-class Northern European interior,&lt;ref name="r121" /&gt; perhaps a dining room. This is Campin's main innovation; showing a reading Madonna, with unbound hair in a then familiar setting; an image that lead to many adoptions, most famously [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''[[The Magdalen Reading|Reading Magdalen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlieb (1970), 65&lt;/ref&gt; The colours of the central panel are dominated by the cool grays of the plaster and the brown of the timber wall.&lt;ref name="g76"&gt;Gottlieb (1970), 76&lt;/ref&gt; The lower half is characterised by warmer and deeper brownish greens and reds.&lt;ref name="r117"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 117&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian suggest that the success of the panel is due to the contrast between the warm reds of the Virgin's robe and the pale blue hues of the archangel [[Gabriel]]'s vestment.&lt;ref name="r118"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 118&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mérode Altarpiece (Mary).jpg|left|thumb|240px|Detail with the Virgin reading a book of hours]]
The perspective is very steep and unevenly distributed. The angle of the table in particular is illogical. Art historian [[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] describes these distortions as "disturbing".&lt;ref name="c644"&gt;Campbell (1974), 644&lt;/ref&gt; The panel shows the moment before the traditional scene, as Mary, absorbed in her book, is still unaware of the presence of Gabriel.&lt;ref name="r118" /&gt; Mary is in a red gown rather than the more usual blue. She is in a relaxed pose, reading from a [[book of hours]], her hair unbound. Unusually for a medieval depiction of the Annunciation, the dove of the Holy Spirit is not included. Instead he is represented by the extinguished light of the candle, and the beam of light falling from the window to the left, which carries the Christ Child holding a cross.&lt;ref name="r479"&gt;Reuterswärd (1998), 47–51&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Christ Child flies down towards Mary from the left oculus, signifying her impregnation by [[God the Father]]. He gazes directly at her and holds a cross. The folding-table contains a recently extinguished candle,&lt;ref name="r46" /&gt; and shows coiling smoke and a still glowing [[Candle wick|wick]]. This maybe a reference to the Holy Spirit, who, according to some late medieval writers, descended to the apostles "like a puff of wind".&lt;ref name="r47"&gt;Reuterswärd (1998), 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The white [[Lilium|lily]] in a Tuscan earthenware jug&lt;ref name="r121" /&gt; on the table represents Mary's virginity and purity, as does the white, [[ocher]] towel. The jug contains a series of enigmatic letters in Latin and Hebraic, deciphered by some art historians as ''De Campyn'', that is the artist's signature.&lt;ref name="r47" /&gt; An opened manuscript is positioned on a green velvet book pouch. Unusually the book is positioned next to the Virgin rather than the shelf. The pages seem worn and handled, indicating that it has been well read.&lt;ref name="r47" /&gt; It has been suggested that the book reflects the [[Carthusian]] [[Ludolf of Saxony]]'s idea of the  secluded life of the Virgin - that she earlier lived with "the Holy Scriptures as her sole companion".&lt;ref&gt;Châtelet, quoted in Reuterswärd (1998), 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The right hand half of the back wall holds three windows, one of which contains a [[Latticework|lattice]] screen.&lt;ref name="r117" /&gt; The beams of the ceiling are supported by a series of [[corbel]]s.&lt;ref name="r120"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 120&lt;/ref&gt; The sky visible through the windows is a later addition, which was painted over an earlier gold ground. The armorial shields are also later additions.&lt;ref name="r121" /&gt;

===Donors===
[[File:Merode Altarpiece left Panel Detail a.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Left panel, with street scene and attendant]]
The [[donor portrait|donor]] and his wife are shown kneeling in prayer are in the left panel, looking through a half-open door into the Virgin's [[Hortus conclusus]].&lt;ref name="r117"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 117&lt;/ref&gt; The door presents a continuity oddity; although it can be seen opening into the Virgins room from the left panel, no such door entrance is visible in the center panel. Addressing this, the art historians Rose-Marie and Rainer Hagen suppose that the donor is "imagining that she has entered into his house. From without, he has opened the door; with his own eyes he beholds the Mother of God and petitions her for a family".&lt;ref name="h33"&gt;Hagen; Hagen (2003), 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The servant or attendant dressed in a festive outfit&lt;ref name="r122"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 122&lt;/ref&gt; appears to be an later addition by a different artist, perhaps after the donor's marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, (2005), 51–65&lt;/ref&gt; The space contains an unlocked entrance which leads to a minutely detailed street scene.&lt;ref name="r46"&gt;Reuterswärd (1998), 46&lt;/ref&gt; The panel is the more striking as the door leading into the Virgin's chamber is wide open, hugely presumptuous for even a mid-fifteenth century commission, and suggesting access to the gates of heaven.&lt;ref name="g78"&gt;Gottlieb (1970), 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The donors are identifiable as bourgeoisie from nearby [[Mechelen]], and are documented in Tournai in 1427, identifiable from the [[coat of arms]] in the [[stained glass]] window of the central panel.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;

It is assumed that this panel was a later commission to Campin's workshop, not part of the original single panel design. There has been speculation that it was completed by the young [[Rogier van der Weyden]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs (2002), 297&lt;/ref&gt;

The altarpiece was commissioned either by the businessman Jan Engelbrecht, or the [[Cologne]]-born merchant Peter Engelbrecht and his wife Margarete Scrynmaker.&lt;ref name="k441"&gt;Kleiner (2013), 441&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CorkArts"&gt;"[http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-paintings/merode-altarpiece.htm Merode Altarpiece (1435)]". visual-arts-cork.com. Retrieved 1 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Engelbrecht translates from German as "angel brings", while Scrynmaker means "cabinet maker", the latter perhaps influencing the choice of Joseph in the right hand panel.&lt;ref name="k441" /&gt;

===Joseph===
[[File:Annunciation Triptych (Merode Altarpiece) MET DT7259.jpg|thumb|200px|Right panel, detail with street scene and view of [[Liège]]]]
[[Saint Joseph]], a carpenter by trade, occupies the right-hand panel. He is shown at work, boring spike holes into one of the instruments of the Passion. An unusual feature is that, although Mary and Joseph did not marry until after the Annunciation, they are apparently living together and sharing the same space. Joseph is shown with the tools of his craft, including an ax, saw and rod, laid out across a table, and a small footstool, sitting before a fire of burning logs. Joseph's presence is probably intended to invoke  10 :15 from the [[Book of Isaiah]]: "Shall the ax boast itself against him that heweth there-
with? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it?
as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if
the staff should lift up itself as if was it were no wood."&lt;ref name="m267"&gt;Minott (1969), 267&lt;/ref&gt; Isaiah's words were intended as incentatory and revolutionary, were followed by a treatise for the salvation of [[Israel]], and protested against an [[Assyria]]n king he considered considered boorish and vainglorious.&lt;ref name="m267" /&gt; Given this, Joseph is seen by art historians as a reassuring presence, warding the devil from the center panel.&lt;ref name="s185"&gt;Schapiro (1945), 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph is shown as an old man&lt;ref name="s185" /&gt; wearing an [[eggplant]] coloured coat and blue turban, in a panel characterised by dark and warm colours, and framed by the shadows from the window shutters.&lt;ref name="r117"/&gt; He works on a mouse trap, probably intended as a symbol of the cross at the [[Crucifixion]],&lt;ref name="dg129"&gt;Duchesne-Guillemin (1976), 129&lt;/ref&gt; in that it represents an imagined but literal capture of the Devil, said to have held a man in ransom because of the [[original sin|sin of Adam]].&lt;ref name="m268"&gt;Minott (1969), 268&lt;/ref&gt; In some scripts, Christ's naked flesh was served as bait for the devil; "He rejoiced in Christ's death, like a bailiff of death. What he rejoiced in was then his own undoing. The cross of the Lord was the devil's mousetrap; the bait by which he was caught was the Lord's death."&lt;ref&gt;Sermo ccLcxii, "De ascensione Domini" . Migne, Pat. Lat., xxxvII, col. 1210. See Schapiro (1945), 182-87&lt;/ref&gt;

The background contains a cityscape, probably fictitious, showing the spires of two churches, one of which is now lost, the churches of St. Pierre (left) and Sainte Croix (right) in Liege.{{efn-ua|The church is however identifiable from surviving documents and contemporary descriptions. See Duchesne-Guillemin (1976), 129}}&lt;ref name="dg130"&gt;Duchesne-Guillemin (1976), 130-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Merode Altarpiece Center Panel Detail d.jpg|left|thumb|340px|Detail of the center panel]]
The [[Iconography]] contains complex religious symbolism, although their extent and exact nature is debated – [[Meyer Schapiro]] pioneered the study of the symbolism of the mousetrap,&lt;ref name="ms182"&gt;Schapiro (1945), 82&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Erwin Panofsky]] later extended, or perhaps over-extended, the analysis of symbols to cover many more details of the furniture and fittings. Similar debates exist for many Early Netherlandish paintings, and a number of the details seen for the first time here reappear in later Annunciations by other artists. 

The symbolic elements in the central panel mostly relate to the Annunciation, the Mass and the [[sacrament]] of the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;Lane (1984), 42–47&lt;/ref&gt; Mary sits on the floor to show her humility. The [[scroll]] and book in front of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]] symbolize the Old and the [[New Testament]]s, and the roles Mary and the [[Christ]] child played in the fulfillment of prophecy.  The lilies in the earthenware vase on the table represent Mary's virginity. Other symbols of her purity include the enclosed garden (''[[Hortus conclusus]]''),&lt;ref name="k441" /&gt; and the white towel, while the small windows to the right, and  the half-closed windows at the rear, serve to emphasise the quiet, virginal life she has lived.&lt;ref name="h33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CorkArts" /&gt;

[[File:Merode Altarpiece Center Panel Detail c.jpg|thumb|300px|Detail with [[coat of arms]] in window, center panel]]
The lion finials on the bench may have a symbolic role (referring to the [[Seat of Wisdom]], or throne of [[Solomon]]) – this feature is often seen in other paintings, religious or secular (like [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'').  The arrangements for washing at the back of the room, which are considered unusual for a domestic interior, may relate to the similar arrangements of a [[piscina]] for the officiating priest to wash his hands during [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].  The sixteen sides of the table may allude to the sixteen main Hebrew prophets; the table is usually seen as an altar, and the [[archangel]] [[Gabriel]] wears the [[vestment]]s of a [[deacon]].&lt;ref&gt;McNamee (1998), 151&lt;/ref&gt; The basin may represent both the purity of Virgin, and the cleansing of the Christian act of [[baptism]].&lt;ref&gt;Gottlieb (1970), 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In the right-hand panel, [[Saint Joseph]], a carpenter, has constructed a mouse trap symbolizing Christ's trapping and defeat of the devil, a metaphor used three times by [[Saint Augustine]]: "The cross of the Lord was the devil's mousetrap; the bait by which he was caught was the Lord's death."&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro (1945), 1&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography of the right-hand panel has been studied in detail by Russell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=Malcolm|date=2017|title=The woodworker and the Redemption: the right shutter of the Merode triptych|url=|journal=Simiolus|volume=39|pages=335-350|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He shows that the object that Joseph is working on is a scandalum or stumbling block, a spiked block that gashes the legs of a punishment victim who walks with it hanging from a cord around his waist. Joseph's joinery instruments are displayed in a consistently unnatural manner, suggesting that they have been planned to fit a specific agenda; for example the joinery instruments on the table are so placed as to represent the three crosses of Christ and the two thieves.

==Provenance==
Its early history is obscure. The triptych was owned by the aristocratic [[Belgium|Belgian]]  [[Arenberg]] and [[House of Merode|Mérode]] families from 1820 to 1849 before reaching the art market, and has been in the collection of [[the Cloisters]], New York since 1956. Until its acquisition it had been in private collection for many years and thus inaccessible to both scholars and the public. Its purchase was funded by [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] and was described at the time as a "major event for the history of collecting in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16028coll12/id/871 The Merode Altarpiece, a great and famous landmark in the history of western painting, by the Master of Flémalle, has been acquired for the Cloisters]".

'''Neuroesthetics''' ([[Differences between British and American English|or]] '''neuroaesthetics''') is a relatively recent sub-discipline of empirical [[aesthetics]]. Empirical aesthetics takes a [[Scientific method|scientific]] approach to the study of [[aesthetic]] [[perception]]s of [[art]], [[music]], or any object that can give rise to aesthetic judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00443/full|title = Crossing boundaries: toward a general model of neuroaesthetics|last = Martin|first = Manuela M.|date = 7 August 2015|journal = Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|doi = 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00443|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroesthetics received its formal definition in 2002 as the scientific study of the [[Nervous system|neural]] bases for the contemplation and creation of a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nalbantian|first=Suzanne|title=Neuroaesthetics: neuroscientific theory and illustration from the arts|journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews|date=December 2008|volume=33|issue=4|pages=357–368|doi=10.1179/174327908X392906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroesthetics uses [[neuroscience]] to explain and understand the aesthetic experiences at the [[neurology|neurological]] level.  The topic attracts scholars from many disciplines including [[neuroscientist]]s, [[art historian]]s, [[artist]]s, [[psychologist]]s,

== Overview ==
Neuroaesthetics is a field of experimental science that aims to combine (neuro-)psychological research with aesthetics by investigating the "perception, production, and response to art, as well as interactions with objects and scenes that evoke an intense feeling, often of pleasure.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neuroaesthetics: a coming of age story|journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date = 2011-01-01|issn = 1530-8898|pmid = 20175677|pages = 53–62|volume = 23|issue = 1|doi = 10.1162/jocn.2010.21457|first = Anjan|last = Chatterjee}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recently developed field seeks among other things the [[neural correlate]]s of aesthetic judgment and creativity. It is argued that visual aesthetics, namely the capacity of assigning different degrees of beauty to certain forms, colors, or movements, is a human trait acquired after the divergence of human and other ape lineages,&lt;ref name="conde"/&gt; rendering the experience of beauty a defining characteristic of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Next steps in neuroaesthetics: Which processes and processing stages to study?|last = Leder|first = Helmut|date = 2013|journal = Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One core question for the field is whether art or aesthetic preferences are guided by a set of universal laws or principles. Additionally, the evolutionary rationale for the formation and characteristics of these principles are sought. It is believed that identification of the brain circuitry involved in aesthetic judgments (e.g., by using through the use of [[brain imaging]]) can help pinpoint the origin of these responses.&lt;ref name="ramachandran"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramachandran|first=V.S.|author2=Hirstein, William|title=The Science of Art: A Neurological Theory of Aesthetic Experience|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|year=1999|volume=6|issue=6–7|pages=15–51|url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/rama/art.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302011954/http://www.imprint.co.uk/rama/art.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches of study ==
Researchers who have been prominent in the field combine principles from [[perceptual psychology]], [[evolutionary biology]], neurological deficits, and functional brain anatomy in order to address the evolutionary meaning of beauty that may be the essence of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyler|first=C. W.|title=NEUROSCIENCE:Enhanced: Is Art Lawful?|journal=Science|date=30 July 1999|volume=285|issue=5428|pages=673–674|doi=10.1126/science.285.5428.673}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is felt that neuroscience is a very promising path for the search for the quantified evaluation of art.&lt;ref name=technoscience&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salah|first=A.A.A.|author2=Salah, A.A|title=Technoscience art: A bridge between neuroesthetics and art history?|journal=Review of General Psychology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=147–158|url=http://oai.cwi.nl/oai/asset/12500/12500B.pdf|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.12.2.147|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the aim of discovering general rules about aesthetics, one approach is the observation of subjects viewing art and the exploration of the mechanics of [[Visual perception|vision]].&lt;ref name="technoscience" /&gt; It is proposed that pleasing sensations are derived from the repeated activation of neurons due to primitive visual stimuli such as horizontal and vertical lines. In addition to the generation of theories to explain this, such as [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran|Ramachandran's]] set of laws, it is important to use neuroscience to determine and understand the neurological mechanisms involved.

The link between specific brain areas and artistic activity is of great importance to the field of neuroesthetics.&lt;ref name="technoscience" /&gt; This can be applied both to the ability to create and interpret art. A common approach to uncover the neural mechanisms is through the study of individuals, specifically artists, with neural disorders such as [[savant syndrome]] or some form of [[traumatic injury]]. The analysis of art created by these patients provides valuable insights to the brain areas responsible for capturing the essence of art.

The aesthetic enjoyment of individuals can be investigated using brain imaging experiments. When subjects are confronted with images of a particular level of aesthetics, the specific brain areas that are activated can be identified. It is argued that the sense of beauty and aesthetic judgment presupposes a change in the activation of the brain's reward system.&lt;ref name="technoscience"/&gt;

A crucial aspect of research lies in whether aesthetic judgment can be thought of as a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up process]] driven by neural primitives or as a top-down process with high level cognition. Neurologists have had success researching primitives. However, there is a need to define higher level abstract philosophical concepts objectively with neural correlates. It is suggested that aesthetic experience is a function of the interaction between top-down, intentional orientation of attention and the bottom-up perceptual facilitation of image construction.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cupchik Gerald C | year = 2009 | title = Viewing artworks: Contributions of cognitive control and perceptual facilitation to aesthetic experience | url = | journal = Brain and Cognition | volume = 70 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–91 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandc.2009.01.003 | pmid = 19223099 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, because untrained persons automatically apply the object-identification habit to viewing artworks, top-down control to reduce this habit may be necessary to engage aesthetic perception. This suggests that artists would show different levels of activation than non-artists.

Aesthetic responses to different types of art and techniques has recently been explored. Cubism is the most radical departure from Western forms of art, with the proposed purpose of forcing the viewer to discover less unstable elements of the object to be represented. It eliminates interferences such as lighting and perspective angle to capture objects as they really are. This may be compared to how the brain maintains an object's identity despite varying conditions.&lt;ref name = "lengger"/&gt; [[modern art|Modern]], [[representational art|representational]], and [[impressionism|impressionistic art]] has also been studied for the purpose of explaining visual processing systems. Yet aesthetic judgments exists in all domains, not just art.&lt;ref name="technoscience" /&gt;

== Theories of pioneers ==
{{underlinked|section|date=October 2012}}

=== Semir Zeki's laws of the visual brain ===
[[Semir Zeki]], professor of neuroesthetics at the [[University College London|University College of London]], views art as an example of the variability of the brain.&lt;ref name = "zeki2"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zeki Semir | year = 2001 | title = Artistic Creativity and the Brain | url = | journal = Science | volume = 293 | issue = 5527| pages = 51–52 | doi=10.1126/science.1062331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zeki3"&gt;Zeki, Semir. (1999). Inner Vision: an exploration of art and the brain. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zeki4"&gt;Zeki, Semir. (2008). Splendours and Miseries of the Brain, Wiley Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a neurological approach to the source of this variability may explain particular subjective experiences as well as the ranges of abilities to create and experience art. Zeki theorizes that artists unconsciously use techniques to create visual art to study the brain. Zeki suggests that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...the artist is in a sense, a neuroscientist, exploring the potentials and capacities of the brain, though with different tools. How such creations can arouse aesthetic experiences can only be fully understood in neural terms. Such an understanding is now well within our reach."&lt;ref&gt;Zeki, Semir. "[http://www.neuroesthetics.org/statement-on-neuroesthetics.php Statement on Neuroesthetics]." Neuroesthetics. Web. 24 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He proposes two supreme laws of the visual brain.

====Constancy====
Despite the changes that occur when processing visual stimuli (distance, viewing angle, illumination, etc.), the brain has the unique ability to retain knowledge of constant and essential properties of an object and discard irrelevant dynamic properties. This applies not only to the ability to always see a banana as the color yellow but also the recognition of faces at varying angles.

Comparatively, a work of art captures the essence of an object. The creation of art itself may be modeled off of this primitive neural function. The process of painting for example involves distilling an object down to represent it as it really is, which differs from the way the eyes see it. Zeki also tried to represent the [[Theory of Forms|Platonic Ideal]] and the [[Hegelianism|Hegelian Concept]] through the statement: forms do not have an existence without a brain and the ability for stored memory, referring to how artists such as Monet could paint without knowing what the objects in order to capture their true form.&lt;ref name = "zeki1998"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zeki Semir | year = 1998 | title = Art and the Brain | url = | journal = Daedalus | volume = 127 | issue = 2| page = 71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abstraction====
This process refers to the hierarchical coordination where a general representation can be applied to many particulars, allowing the brain to efficiently process visual stimuli. The ability to abstract may have evolved as a necessity due to the limitations of memory. In a way, art externalizes the functions of abstraction in the brain. The process of abstraction is unknown to cognitive neurobiology. However, Zeki proposes an interesting question of whether there is a significant difference in the pattern of brain activity when viewing abstract art as opposed to representational art.&lt;ref name = "zeki2"/&gt;

=== Ramachandran's eight laws of artistic experience ===
[[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]] and his fellow researchers including [[William Hirstein]], developed a highly speculative theory of human artistic experience and the neural mechanisms that mediate it.&lt;ref name="ramachandran" /&gt; These "laws" combine to develop underlying high order concepts of the human artistic experience. Although not all encompassing as there are undoubtedly many other principles of artistic experience, the theorists claim that they provide a framework for understanding aspects of visual art, aesthetics and design. Although testing of these principles quantitatively may provide future evidence for specific areas of the brain responsible for one kind of aesthetic appeal, the theory faces substantial philosophical and historical objections.

====Peak shift principle====
&lt;!-- Redirect from [[Peak Shift Phenomenon]] --&gt;
This psychological phenomenon is typically known for its application in animal [[discrimination learning]]. In the peak shift effect, animals sometimes respond more strongly to exaggerated versions of the training stimuli. For instance, a rat is trained to discriminate a square from a rectangle by being rewarded for recognizing the rectangle. The rat will respond more frequently to the object for which it is being rewarded to the point that a rat will respond to a rectangle that is longer and more narrow with a higher frequency than the original with which it was trained. This is called a [[supernormal stimulus]]. The fact that the rat is responding more to a 'super' rectangle implies that it is learning a rule.

This effect can be applied to human pattern recognition and aesthetic preference. Some artists attempt to capture the very essence of something in order to evoke a direct emotional response. In other words, they try to make a 'super' rectangle to get the viewer to have an enhanced response. To capture the essence of something, an artist amplifies the differences of that object, or what makes it unique, to highlight the essential features and reduce redundant information. This process mimics what the visual areas of the brain have evolved to do and more powerfully activates the same neural mechanisms that were originally activated by the original object.&lt;ref name="ramachandran" /&gt;

Some artists deliberately exaggerate creative components such as shading, highlights, and illumination to an extent that would never occur in a real image to produce a [[caricature]]. These artists may be unconsciously producing heightened activity in the specific areas of the brain in a manner that is not obvious to the conscious mind. It should be noted here that a significant portion of the experience of art is not self-consciously reflected upon by audiences, so it is not clear whether the peak-shift thesis has any special explanatory power in understanding the creation and reception of art.

====Isolation====
Isolating a single visual cue helps the organism allocate attention to the output of a single module thereby allowing it to more effectively enjoy the peak shift along the dimensions represented in that module.&lt;ref name="ramachandran" /&gt; In other words, there is a need to isolate the desired visual form before that aspect is amplified. This is why an outline drawing or sketch is sometimes more effective as art than an original color photograph. For example, a cartoonist may exaggerate certain facial features which are unique to the character and remove other forms which it shares such as skin tones. This efficiency prevents non-unique features from detracting from the image. This is why one can predict that an outline drawing would be more aesthetically pleasing than a color photograph.

The viewers attention is drawn towards this single area allowing one's attention to be focused on this source of information. Enhancements introduced by the artist more carefully noted resulting in the amplification of [[limbic system]] activation and reinforcement.

====Grouping====
Perceptual grouping to delineate a figure from the background may be enjoyable. The source of the pleasure may have come about because of the evolutionary necessity to give organisms an incentive to uncover objects, such as predators, from noisy environments. For example, when viewing ink blots, the visual system segments the scene to defeat camouflage and link a subset of splotches together. This may be accomplished most effectively if limbic reinforcement is fed back to early vision at every stage of visual processing leading up to the discovery of the object. The key idea is that due to the limited attentional resources, constant feedback facilitates processing of features at earlier stages due to the discovery of a clue which produces limbic activation to draw one's attention to important features.&lt;ref name="ramachandran" /&gt; Though not spontaneous, this reinforcement is the source of the pleasant sensation. The discovery of the object itself results in a pleasant 'aha' revelation causing the organism to hold onto the image.

An artist can make use of this phenomenon by teasing the system. This allows for temporary binding to be communicated by a signal to the limbic system for reinforcement which is a source of the aesthetic experience.

====Contrast====
Extracting contrast involves eliminating redundant information and focusing attention. Cells in the [[retina]], the [[Lateral geniculate nucleus|lateral geniculate body]] or relay station in the brain, and in the [[visual cortex]] respond predominantly to step changes in luminance rather than homogeneous surface colors. Smooth gradients are much harder for the visual system to detect rather than segmented divisions of shades resulting in easily detectable edges. Contrasts due to the formation of edges may be pleasing to the eye. The importance of the visual neuron's varying responses to the orientation and presence of edges has previously been proven by [[David H. Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel]].&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may hold evolutionary significance since regions of contrast are information rich requiring reinforcement and the allocation of attention. In contrast to the principle of grouping, contrasting features are typically in close proximity eliminating the need to link distant, but similar features.

====Perceptual problem solving====
Tied to the detection of contrast and grouping is the concept that discovery of an object after a struggle is more pleasing than one which is instantaneously obvious. The mechanism ensures that the struggle is reinforcing so that the viewer continues to look until the discovery. From a survival point of view, this may be important for the continued search for predators. Ramachandran suggests for the same reason that a model whose hips and breasts are about to be revealed is more provocative than one who is already completely naked.&lt;ref name="ramachandran" /&gt; A meaning that is implied is more alluring than one that is explicit.

====The generic viewpoint====
The visual system dislikes interpretations which rely on a unique vantage point. Rather it accepts the visual interpretation for which there is an infinite set of viewpoints that could produce the class of retinal images. For example, in a landscape image, it will interpret an object in the foreground as obscuring an object in the background, rather than assuming that the background figure has a piece missing. 
In theory, if an artist is trying to please the eye, they should avoid such coincidences.&lt;ref name="ramachandran" /&gt; However, in certain applications, the violation of this principle can also produce a pleasing effect.

====Visual metaphors====
Ramachandran defines a metaphor as a mental tunnel between two concepts that appear grossly dissimilar on the surface, but instead share a deeper connection. Similar to the effects of perceptual problem solving, grasping an analogy is rewarding. It enables the viewer to highlight crucial aspects that the two objects share. Although it is uncertain whether the reason for this mechanism is for effective communication or purely cognitive, the discovery of similarities between superficially dissimilar events leads to activation of the limbic system to create a rewarding process.&lt;ref name="ramachandran" /&gt;

Support for this view is highlighted by the symptoms of [[Capgras delusion]], where sufferers experience reduced facial recognition due to impairments in the connections from the inferotemporal cortex to the [[amygdala]], which is responsible for emotions. The result is that a person no longer experiences the warm fuzzy feeling when presented with a familiar face. A person's 'glow' is lost through what is suggested as due to the lack of limbic activation.

====Symmetry====
The aesthetic appeal of symmetry is easily understandable. Biologically it is important during the detection of a predator, location of prey, and the choosing of a mate as all of these tend to display symmetry in nature. It complements other principles relating to the discovering of information rich objects. Additionally, evolutionary biologists suggest that the predisposition towards symmetry is because biologically, asymmetry is associated with infection and disease,&lt;ref name ="ramachandran"/&gt; which can lead to poor mate selection. However, departures from symmetry in visual art are also widely considered beautiful, suggesting that while symmetry may explain the judgment that a particular individual's face is beautiful, it cannot explain the judgment that a work of art is beautiful.

== Areas of the brain linked to the processing of visual aesthetics ==
Aesthetic perception relies heavily on the processing by the visual centers in the brain such as the [[Visual cortex|V1 cortex]]. Signals from V1 are distributed to various specialized areas of the brain.&lt;ref name = "zeki2"/&gt; There is no single area where all specialized visual circuitry connect, reducing the chances of determining a single neural center responsible for aesthetics, rather a neural network is more likely.&lt;ref name = "conde"/&gt; Therefore, the visual brain consists of several parallel multistage processing systems, each specialized in a given task such as color or motion. Functional specializations of the visual brain are already known.&lt;ref name = "kawabata" /&gt;

Physiological phenomenon can explain several aspects of art appreciation. Different [[Extrastriate cortex|extrastriate areas]] of the visual cortex may have evolved to extract correlations of different visual features. The discovery and linking of various visual stimuli is facilitated and reinforced by direct connections from these areas to [[Limbic system|limbic structures]]. Additionally, art may be most appealing if it produces heightened activity in a single dimension rather than redundant activation of multiple modules, restricted by the allocation of attentional resources.&lt;ref name = "ramachandran" /&gt; In experimentation to determine specific areas, many researchers allow the viewer to decide the aesthetic appeal prior to the use of imaging techniques to account for the varying perceptions of beauty. When individuals contemplate the aesthetic appeal, different neural processes are engaged than when pragmatically viewing an image.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt; However, processes of object identification and aesthetic judgment are involved simultaneously in the overall perception of aesthetics.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt; [[File:MRI of orbitofrontal cortex.jpg|thumb|left|Location of the orbito-frontal cortex shown through MRI]]

===Prefrontal cortex===
The [[prefrontal cortex]] is previously known for its roles in the perception of colored objects, decision making, and memory. Recent studies have also linked it to the conscious aesthetic experience because it is activated during aesthetic tasks such as determining the appeal of a visual stimuli. This may be because a judgment is needed, requiring visiospatial memory. In a study performed by Zeki and Kawabata, it was found that the [[orbito-frontal cortex]] (OFC) is involved in the judgment of whether a painting is beautiful or not.&lt;ref name="kawabata"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kawabata Hideaki, Zeki Semir | year = 2004 | title = Neural Correlates of Beauty | url = | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 91 | issue = 1| pages = 1699–1705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is high activation in this region when a person views paintings which they consider beautiful. Surprisingly, when a person views a painting which they consider ugly, no separate structures are activated. Therefore, it is proposed that changes in the intensity of activation in the orbito-frontal cortex correlate with the determination of beauty (higher activation) or ugliness (lower activation). Additionally, the medial OFC has been found to respond aesthetics in terms of the context of which it is presented, such as text or other descriptions about the artwork. The current evidence linking the OFC to attributed hedonistic values across gustatory, olfactory, and visual modalities, suggests that the OFC is a common center for the assessment of a stimulus's value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kirk Ulrich | displayauthors=etal | year = 2008 | title = Modulation of aesthetic value by semantic context: An fMRI study | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.10.009 | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 1125–1132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of aesthetics for these areas must be due to the activation of the brain's reward system with a certain intensity.

[[File:Gray726-Brodman-prefrontal.svg|thumb|Prefrontal cortex is highlighted in orange. Location of Brodmann's areas indicated by numerical tabs.]]
Additionally, the [[Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex|prefrontal dorsalateral cortex]] (PDC) is selectively activated only by stimuli considered beautiful whereas prefrontal activity as a whole is activated during the judgment of both pleasing and unpleasing stimuli.&lt;ref name = "conde"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cela-Conde Camilo J |displayauthors=etal | year = 2004 | title = Activation of the Prefrontal Cortex in the Human Visual Aesthetic Perception | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 101 | issue = 16| pages = 6321–6325 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0401427101| pmc = 395967}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prefrontal cortex may be generally activated for directing the attention of the cognitive and perceptual mechanisms towards aesthetic perception in viewers untrained in visual arts.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt; In other words, related directly to a person viewing art from an aesthetic perception due to the top-down control of their cognition. The lateral prefrontal cortex is shown to be linked to higher order self-referential procession and the evaluation of internally generated information. The left lateral PFC, [[Brodmann area 10]], may be involved in maintaining attention on the execution of internally generated goals associated with approaching art from an aesthetic orientation.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt; As previously mentioned, directing of attention towards aesthetics may have evolutionary significance.

===Additional areas===
Emotions play a large role in aesthetic processing. Experiments designed specifically to force the subjects to view the artwork subjectively (by inquiring of its aesthetic appeal) rather than simply with the visual systems, revealed a higher activation in the brain's emotional circuitry. Results from these experiments revealed high activation in the bilateral [[Insular cortex|insula]] which can be attributed to the emotional experience of viewing art.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt; This correlates with other known emotional roles of the insula. However, the correlation between the insula's varying states of activation and positive or negative emotions in this context is unknown. The emotional view of art can be contrasted with perception related to object recognition when pragmatically viewing art. The right [[fusiform gyrus]] has been revealed to show activation to visual stimuli such as faces and representational art.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt; This holds importance in the field because as Ramachandran also speculated, object recognition and the search for meaning can evoke a pleasant emotional response. The [[motor cortex]] was also shown to be involved in aesthetic perception. However, it displayed opposite trends of activation from the OFC.&lt;ref name="kawabata"/&gt; It may be a common correlate for the perception of emotionally charged stimuli despite its previously known roles. Several other areas of the brain were shown to be slightly activated during certain studies such as the [[anterior cingulate cortex]],&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kawabata"/&gt; previously known for its involvement in the feeling of romance, and the left [[Parietal lobe|parietal cortex]], whose purpose may be to direct spatial attention.&lt;ref name="kawabata"/&gt;

Different artistic styles may also be processed differently by the brain. In a study between filtered forms of [[Abstract art|abstract]] and [[Representation (arts)|representation art]], the bilateral [[Occipital lobe|occipital]] [[gyri]], left [[cingulate sulcus]], and bilateral [[fusiform gyrus]] showed increased activation with increased preference when viewing art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vartanian O., Goel V | year = 2004 | title = Neuroanatomical correlates of aesthetic preference for paintings | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 15 | issue = 5| pages = 893–897 | doi=10.1097/00001756-200404090-00032}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, activation in the bilateral occipital gyri may be caused by the large processing requirements placed on the visual system when viewing high levels of visual detail in artwork such as representational paintings.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt; Several areas of the brain have been shown to respond particularly to forms representational art perhaps due to the brain's ability to make object associations and other functions relating to attention and memory. This form of stimuli leads to increased activation in the left [[frontal lobe]] and bilaterally in the parietal and [[limbic lobe]]s.&lt;ref name = "lengger"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lengger Petra G | year = 2007 | title = Functional neuroanatomy of the perception of modern art: A DC-EEG study on the influence of stylistic information on aesthetic experience | url = | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1158 | issue = | pages = 93–102 | doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2007.05.001| pmid = 17559816 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the left superior parietal lobule, [[Brodmann area 7|Brodmann's area 7]], has been shown to play a role in active image construction during the viewing of art specifically containing indeterminate forms such as soft edge paintings.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt; Bottom up processes such as edge detection and the exploration of visual stimuli are engaged during this type of aesthetic perception. These roles are consistent with previously known parietal lobe responsibilities in spatial cognition and visual imagery.&lt;ref name="Cupchik"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
There are several objections to researchers' attempts to reduce aesthetic experience to a set of physical or neurological laws.&lt;ref&gt;For a general critique, see Jonathan Gilmore, "Brain Trust," Artforum. Online at http://www.italianacademy.columbia.edu/art_and_neuro/paper_su06_Gilmore.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is questionable whether the theories can capture the evocativeness or originality of individual works of art.&lt;ref name = "ramachandran" /&gt; Experiments performed may not account for these theories directly. Also, current experimentation measures a person's verbal response to how they feel about art which is often selectively filtered. Ramachandran suggests the use of [[galvanic skin response]] to quantify the judgment associated viewing aesthetics. Overall, it can be argued that there is lack of proportion between the narrow approach to art taken by researchers versus the grand claims they make for their theories.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Anthony. (1999). Signs of the Times: Cracking the code of art's allure. The Unesco Courier.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future directions and related fields ==
Since 2005 the notion of bridging brain science and the visual arts has blossomed into a field of increasing international interest. In his 2008 book, ''Neuroarthistory: from Aristotle and Pliny to Baxandall and Zeki'', Professor [[John Onians]] of the [[University of East Anglia]] considers himself to be at the forefront of the field of neural scientific biased art historical research, although such a 'history' is much shorter than Onians would have us believe. Many historical figures he deals with as precursors for neuroarthistory (Karl Marx, for example) have very little to do with modern neuroscience as it is understood today. Contemporary artists like [[Mark Stephen Smith]] (William Campbell Gallery, USA) and others have developed extensive bodies of work mapping the convergence of brain science and painting. Smith's work explores fundamental visual analogies between neural function and self-expression in abstract art. The past decade has also seen a corresponding growth in the aesthetics of music studied from neuroscientific approaches. Psychological and social approaches to art help provide other theories of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Lavazza, Andrea(2009). Art as a metaphor of the mind. ''Phenom Cogn Sci'', 8 159-182&lt;/ref&gt; Additional research on disorders and psychological conditions that affect visual processing such as [[dementia]] may provide other valuable insights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mendez Mario F | year = 2006 | title = Dementia as a window to the neurology of art | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2004.03.002 | pmid = 15193339 | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 63 | issue = 1| pages = 1–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oceanic art''' or '''Oceanian art''' comprises the creative works made by the native people of the [[Pacific Islands]] and [[Australia]], including areas as far apart as [[Hawaii]] and [[Easter Island]]. Specifically it comprises the works of the two groups of people who settled the area, though during two different periods. They would in time however, come to interact and together reach even more remote islands. The area is often broken down into four separate regions: [[Polynesia]], [[Micronesia]], [[Australasia]], and [[Melanesia]]. The former two share a common ancestral culture of the [[Lapita]], while the latter two comprise settlers of the first wave of people into the area. All of the regions in later times would be greatly affected by western influence and colonization. In more recent times, the people of [[Oceania]] have found a greater appreciation of their region's artistic heritage.

The artistic creations of these people varies greatly throughout the cultures and regions. The subject matter typically carries themes of fertility or the supernatural. Art such as masks were used in religious ceremonies or social rituals. [[Petroglyphs]], [[Tattooing]],  painting, wood carving, stone carving and textile work are other common art forms. Contemporary Pacific art is alive and well, encompassing traditional styles, symbols, and materials, but now imagined in a diversity of contemporary forms, revealing the complexity of geographic, cultural and individual interaction and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brunt|first1=Peter|title=Art in Oceania: A New History|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-0-300-19028-1|pages=410–497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Atingting Kon 001.JPG|thumb|left|Split gong figures from [[Vanuatu]]]]
Art of Oceania properly encompasses the artistic traditions of the people indigenous to Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Island and Lebanon Dahia. The ancestors of the people of these islands came from Southeast Asia by two different groups at separate times. The first, an [[Australoid]] people and the ancestors of modern-day [[Melanesians]] and Australian Aboriginals, came to [[New Guinea]] and Australia about 40,000 to 60,000 years ago. The Melanesians expanded as far as the northern [[Solomon Islands]] by 38,000 BC. The second wave, from [[Southeast Asia]], would not come for another 30,000 years. They would come to interact and together reach even the most remote Pacific islands. These early peoples lacked a writing system, and made works on perishable materials, so few records of them exist from this time.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/02/oc/ht02oc.htm Oceania, 80000-2000 B.C.]. Retrieved on June 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that Oceanic peoples traditionally did not see their work in the western concept of "art", but rather created objects for the practical purpose of use in religious or social ceremonies, or for use in everyday life.&lt;ref name=oce&gt;[[Hutchinson Encyclopedia]]. [http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0039821.html Oceanic art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515024646/http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0039821.html |date=2006-05-15 }}. Retrieved on June 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1500 BC the Lapita culture, descendants of the second wave, would begin to expand and spread into the more remote islands. At around the same time, art began to appear in New Guinea, including the earliest examples of sculpture in Oceania. The period from 1000 BC on, the Lapita people would consolidate and begin to create the contemporary Polynesian cultures of [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], and [[Fiji]]. They would from there venture further out into the Pacific and settle  the [[Marquesas]] and northern [[Cook Islands]] between 200 BC and 1 AD. Additionally from about 1000 BC, trade between the Pacific Islands and mainland Asia was growing, and starting 600 BC, works of the [[Dongson culture]] of [[Vietnam]], known for their bronze working, can be found in Oceania, and their imagery has a strong influence on the indigenous artistic tradition. Records to 1000 AD continue to be few, however most artistic tradition are continued to this point, such as New Guinea sculpture and Australian rock art, although the period is characterized by increasing trade and interaction as well as new areas being settled, including Hawaii, Easter Island, Tahiti, and New Zealand. Starting around 1100 AD, the people of Easter Island would begin construction of nearly 900 [[moai]] (large stone statues). At about 1200 AD, the people of Pohnpei, a Micronesian island, would embark on another megalithic construction, building [[Nan Madol]], a city of artificial islands and a system of canals. By 1500, the first European explorers begin to reach Oceania. Although previous artistic and architectural traditions are continued, the various regions would begin to diverge and record more distinct cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/07/oc/ht07oc.htm Oceania, 1000-1400 A.D.].

==Prehistoric==

The rock art of Australian Aborigines is the longest continuously practiced artistic tradition in the world. These sites, found in [[Arnhem Land]], Australia, are divided into three periods: Pre-Estuarine (c. 40,000?&amp;ndash;6000 BC), Estuarine (c. 6000 BC&amp;ndash;500 AD), and Fresh Water (c. 500 AD&amp;ndash;present). They are dated based on the styles and content of the art. Pre-Estuarine, the oldest, is characterized by imagery in a red ocher pigment. However, by about 6000 BC, increasingly elaborate images begin to appear, marking the beginning of the Estuarine period. These rock paintings served several functions.  Some were used in magic, others to increase animal populations for hunting, while some were simply for amusement. One of the more elaborate collections of rock art in this area is the site of Ubirr, a favored camping ground during wet seasons which has had its rock faces painted many times over thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History [http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/ubir/hd_ubir.htm Ubirr (40,000?B.C.-present)].

Sculpture in Oceania first appears on New Guinea as a series of stone figures found throughout the island, but mostly in mountainous highlands. Establishing a chronological timeframe for these pieces in most cases is difficult, but one has been dated to 1500 BC. The content of the sculptures fit into three categories: mortars, pestles, and freestanding figures. The tops of many pestles contain images, often of birds or human heads. Mortars show similar imagery, or sometimes geometric patterns. Freestanding figures again portray similar themes: humans, animals, and phalluses. The original significance of these pieces however, are unknown, but were perhaps used in the context of rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/ngss/hd_ngss.htm Prehistoric Stone Sculpture from New Guinea]. Retrieved on June 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early culture with an artistic tradition are the Lapita, dating from about 1500 BC to 500 BC, who are thought to be the ancestors of the modern day cultures of [[Polynesia]], [[Micronesia]], and some parts of [[Melanesia]]. The culture was formed by the second wave of Oceanic settlers. The name comes from the site of Lapita in [[New Caledonia]], which was among the first places its distinctive sculpture would be found. It is debated exactly where the culture developed, but the people themselves originally came from Southeast Asia. Their art is best known by its ceramics, which include elaborate geometric motifs and sometimes anthropomorphic imagery. It is thought some of the designs may be related to modern Polynesian tattoos and barkcloths. They were created by firing a comblike tool that stamped the designs on to wet clay. Each stamp would have one design and would be layered until an elaborate pattern was created. Their usage was primarily, in cooking, serving, and storing food.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/lapi/hd_lapi.htm Lapita Pottery (ca. 1500-5000 B.C.)].

Micronesia comprises second-wave settlers of Oceania, encompassing the people of the islands north of Melanesia, and has an artistic tradition attested to the Lapita culture. Among the most prominent works of the region is the megalithic floating city of Nan Madol. The city began in 1200 AD, and is still being built when European explorers begin to arrive around 1600. The city however, undergoes a decline by around 1800 along with the Saudeleur dynasty, and is abandoned altogether by the 1820s. The 19th century would see the region divided up amongst the colonial powers, however art continued to thrive. Wood carving by men in particular flourishes in the region, creating richly decorated ceremonial houses in [[Belau]], stylized bowls, canoe ornaments, ceremonial vessels, and sometimes sculptured figures. Women on the other hand created textiles and ornaments like bracelets and headbands. Stylistically, Micronesian art is streamlined and of a practical simplicity to its function, but is typically finished to a high standard of quality.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/10/oci/ht10oci.htm Micronesia, 1800-1900 A.D.].

The first half of the 20th century saw a downturn in Micronesia's cultural integrity and a strong foreign influence from both western and Japanese Imperialist powers. A number of historical artistic traditions, especially sculptural, simply ceased to be practiced. However other art forms continued, including traditional architecture and weaving. But by the second half of the century, independence from colonial powers allows their traditional arts to find a renewed interest and respect from within the region, and a new generation are taught these art forms. There is also a notable movement of contemporary art within Micronesia toward the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/11/oci/ht11oci.htm Micronesia, 1900 A.D.-present].

Polynesia, like Micronesia, stretched back to Lapita cultural traditions. Lapita Culture included parts of the western Pacific and reached as far east as Tonga and Samoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Alleva|first1=Anne|title=Arts of the Pacific Islands|date=1998|publisher=Abrams|isbn=0-8109-2722-5|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However much of Polynesia, like the islands of Hawaii, New Zealand, [[Tahiti]], and Easter Island, had only relatively recently been settled by indigenous peoples. The most famous Polynesian art forms are the [[Moai]] (statues) of Rapa Nui/Easter Island. Polynesian art is characteristically ornate, and often meant to contain supernatural power or mana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaeppler|first1=Adrienne|title=The Pacific Arts of Polynesia and Micronesia|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-284238-1|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polynesian works of art were thought to contain spiritual power and could affect change in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hooper|first1=Steven|title=Pacific Encounters: Art and Divinity in Polynesia 1760-1860|date=2006|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=978-0-8248-3084-7|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the period beyond 1600 AD had seen intense interaction with European explorers, in addition to continuing earlier cultural traditions. The collections of European explorers during the period show that classical Polynesian art was indeed flourishing. In the 19th century, depopulation of areas due to slave raiding and Western diseases disrupted many societies and cultures. Missionary work in the region caused the conversion to Christianity, and in some cases the destruction of traditional cultural and artistic heritage of the region, specifically sculpture. However more secular art forms continue, such as carving non-religious objects like kava bowls and textile work such as [[Tapa cloth|tapa]] making. With the end of colonialism however, Polynesians increasingly attempted to assert their cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/11/ocp/ht11ocp.htmPolynesia, 1900 A.D.-present].

===Australia===
{{main|Indigenous Australian art}}

Australian Aboriginal people are most known for their rock art, which they continue to practice after their contact with Western explorers. Other forms of art however, reflect their lifestyle of often moving from one camp to another and is utilitarian and portable, albeit still highly decorated. They used rocks and other natural sources mixed with water to make their paint. Often using sticks to make their famous but recent (from 1971) dot paintings. Even today we still see Aboriginals making these. When dancing, they paint their bodies with white "paint" and apply it to their body in patterns and meaningful shapes and lines. Their dancing uses native Australian animals as inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/11/oca/ht11oca.htm Australia, 1800-1900 A.D.].

===Melanesia===
{{further|Papua New Guinean art}}
Melanesia, comprising New Guinea and the surrounding islands and people of first wave settlers, has perhaps the most striking art of all Oceania. Stylistically art is typically highly decorative and portrays exaggerated forms, often of sexual themes. It is mostly made in connection with ancestors, hunting, and cannibalism. Commonly they would be used in the context of spiritual rituals, such as the creation of elaborate masks. However, few examples of Melanesian art exist on the islands today.&lt;ref name=oce/&gt;

After 1600, like the other regions of Oceania, saw increasing encounters with European explorers. What they witnessed was a flourishing tradition of art and culture, such as the first record of the region's elaborate wood carving. It isn't until the latter half of the 19th century, however, that westernization begins to takes its toll. Some traditional forms of art go into decline, but others like sculpture survive and even thrive in the region. Not until more of the islands were explored by the western powers that the sheer diversity of Melanesian art begins to be seen. By the 20th century, Melanesian art begins to find its way to the West and has a profound impact on contemporary artists. However a great cultural disruption would follow the second World War, and much traditional art would begin to decline or be destroyed. This would be followed decades later by a newfound appreciation for their native art forms.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/11/ocm/ht11ocm.htm Melanesia, 1900 A.D.-present].

It developed a set of dramatic and theatrical [[Dramatic convention|conventions]] with the aim of bringing a greater fidelity of real life to texts and performances. Part of [[Realism (arts)|a broader artistic movement]], it includes [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] and [[Socialist realism]].

Russia's first professional playwright, [[Aleksey Pisemsky]], along with [[Leo Tolstoy]] (in his ''[[The Power of Darkness]]'' of 1886), began a tradition of psychological realism in Russia. A new type of acting was required to replace the declamatory conventions of the [[well-made play]] with a technique capable of conveying the speech and movements found in the domestic situations of [[everyday life]]. This need was supplied by the innovations of the [[Moscow Art Theatre]], founded by [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]].&lt;ref name=HartnollFound2003&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Hartnoll, Phyllis |editor2=Found, Peter |title=The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre| year=2003| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=0-19-282574-7 | pages=341, 409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the subtle expression of emotion in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' through everyday small-talk had initially gone unappreciated in a more traditionally conventional production in St Petersburg, a new staging by the Moscow Art Theatre brought the play and its author, as well as the company, immediate success.&lt;ref name=Esslin-2003&gt;Esslin (2003), pp. 353-356&lt;/ref&gt; A logical development was to take the revolt against theatrical artifice a step further in the direction of naturalism, and Stanislavski, especially in his production of [[Maxim Gorky]]'s ''[[The Lower Depths]]'', helped this movement achieve international recognition.&lt;ref name=HartnollFound2003/&gt; The Moscow Art Theatre's ground-breaking productions of plays by Chekhov, such as ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' and ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'', in turn influenced [[Maxim Gorky]] and [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]. Stanislavski went on to develop his 'system', a form of [[actor training]] that is particularly well-suited to psychological realism.

19th-century realism is closely connected to the development of modern drama, which, as Martin Harrison explains, "is usually said to have begun in the early 1870s" with the "middle-period" work of the Norwegian dramatist [[Henrik Ibsen]]. Ibsen's realistic drama in prose has been "enormously influential."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (1998), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[opera]], ''[[verismo]]'' refers to a post-Romantic Italian tradition that sought to incorporate the Naturalism of Émile Zola and Henrik Ibsen. It included realistic – sometimes sordid or violent – depictions of contemporary everyday life, especially the life of the lower classes. 

== Added to Realism ==
3D details were added by 1800. By 1850 settings, costumes and details became historically accurate and had more logic to the plays.

==Stanislavski's distinction==
As part of a strategic argument in his day, Stanislavski used the term "psychological realism" to distinguish his [[Stanislavski's system|'system']] of acting from his own [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalistic]] early stagings of the plays of [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Maxim Gorky]], and others. Jean Benedetti argues that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Naturalism, for him, implied the indiscriminate reproduction of the surface of life. Realism, on the other hand, while taking its material from the real world and from direct observation, selected only those elements which revealed the relationships and tendencies under the surface. The rest was discarded.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (2005), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As used in critical literature today, however, the term Naturalism has a broader scope than that, within which all of Stanislavski's work falls. In this broader sense, Naturalism or "psychological realism" is distinct both from [[Socialist realism]] and the critical realism developed by the [[epic theatre]] of [[Bertolt Brecht]].

'''S4C''' ({{IPA-cy|ɛs ˈpɛdwar ɛk}}, from the Welsh {{lang|cy|Sianel Pedwar Cymru}}, meaning "Channel 4 Wales") is a Welsh-language British public-service TV channel broadcast throughout the [[UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland]]. The first television channel to be aimed specifically at a Welsh-speaking audience, S4C is the fourth-oldest television channel in the [[United Kingdom]], after [[BBC One]], [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[BBC Two]]. As of 2017-2018, S4C had an average of 131 employees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

S4C's headquarters is based in [[Cardiff]], with a regional office located in [[Caernarfon]]. S4C will relocate its headquarters to [[Carmarthen]] in the autumn of 2018, based at the new Yr Egin digital creative hub being developed by [[University of Wales Trinity Saint David]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.s4c.cymru/media/media_assets/s4c-annual-report-and-accounts-spreads.pdf|title=Annual Report and Statement of Accounts|last=|first=|date=|website=S4C|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When first established, the channel—initially broadcast on [[analogue television]]—was bilingual (Welsh and English) outside peak hours, with English-language content consisting of the simultaneous or deferred transmission of programmes from [[Channel 4]] (analogue reception of which was unavailable in most of Wales). When [[digital television]] arrived several years later, S4C added a second, 100% Welsh-language service, called S4C Digidol ("digital"). With the completion of the [[Digital switchover dates in the United Kingdom#Wales|digital switchover in Wales]] on 31 March 2010—which made English-language Channel 4 available across Wales—S4C's bilingual analogue channel closed, and what had been S4C Digidol became the default S4C channel, available on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], satellite and cable, and broadcasting entirely in Welsh. S4C does not commission programming in English, but when English is used on the channel it is left untranslated.

==Pre-history==
Before the launch of S4C on Monday 1 November 1982 (one day before Channel 4 in the rest of the UK), Welsh speakers had been served by occasional programmes in Welsh, broadcast as regional opt-outs on [[BBC Wales]] and [[Harlech Television|HTV Cymru Wales]] (the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] franchise in Wales), usually at off-peak or inconvenient times. This was unsatisfactory for Welsh speakers, who saw the arrangement as a sop, and at the same time an annoyance for non-Welsh speakers, who found the English language programmes seen in the rest of the UK often rescheduled or not transmitted at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Welshing on TV|date=28 June 1980|work=The Economist|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 the ITV network had created a licence area for North and West Wales, which was awarded to ''Wales (West and North) Limited''. This traded as [[Teledu Cymru]] and provided significant levels of Welsh-language programming. However, problems with transmission infrastructure and poor market research led to financial difficulties within two years and the station was taken over by its neighbour [[Television Wales and West]].

During the 1970s, Welsh-language activists had campaigned for a TV service in the language, which already had its own radio station, [[BBC Radio Cymru]]. Both the Conservative and Labour parties promised a Welsh-language fourth channel, if elected to government in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A channel for Wales|first=Dafydd|last=Hancock|work=EMC Seefour|publisher=Transdiffusion Broadcasting System|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/seefour/wales.php|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304205140/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/seefour/wales.php|archivedate=4 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the Conservatives won a majority in the election, the new Home Secretary [[William Whitelaw]] decided against a Welsh fourth channel, and suggested that, except for an occasional opt-out, the service should be the same as that offered in the rest of the UK. This led to acts of civil disobedience, including refusals to pay the [[television licence]] fee, thereby running the risk of prosecution or even a prison sentence, and sit-ins in BBC and HTV studios. Some took more extreme measures, including attacking television transmitters in Welsh-speaking areas.

In 1980, the former president of [[History of Plaid Cymru|Plaid Cymru]], [[Gwynfor Evans]], threatened to go on hunger strike if the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] did not honour its commitment to provide a Welsh-language TV service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gwynfor Evans at 90|work=BBC News Online|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2227826.stm|date=1 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel started broadcasting on 1 November 1982, the night before Channel 4's opening. 

==Programming==
[[File:Headquarters of S4C.jpg|thumb|The headquarters of S4C in [[Llanishen]], [[Cardiff]]]]
S4C's remit is to provide a service which features a wide range of programmes in the Welsh language. Like Channel 4, S4C does not produce programmes of its own; instead, it commissions programmes from [[BBC Cymru Wales]] and independent producers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Celtic World|page=800 |chapter=Language and Identity in Modern Wales|last=Green|first=Miranda|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|ISBN=978-0-415-05764-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although the quantity purchased from [[ITV Wales &amp; West|ITV Cymru Wales]] has greatly reduced since the early years of S4C), and it has particularly developed a reputation for commissioning animation, such as ''[[SuperTed]]'', ''[[Rocky Hollow]]'', ''[[Fireman Sam]]'' (also broadcast by the [[BBC]]), ''[[Gogs]]'', ''[[Shakespeare: The Animated Tales]]'' and ''[[Animated Tales of the World]]''.

[[BBC Wales]] fulfils its public service requirement by producing programmes in Welsh, including ''[[Newyddion]]'', S4C's news bulletin, and a soap opera, ''[[Pobol y Cwm]]'', and providing them to S4C free of charge. It has also provided (or licensed) Welsh-language versions of English-language programmes, such as ''[[The Tweenies]]''. On the analogue service, S4C showed programmes produced for Channel 4 in the rest of the United Kingdom – either [[simulcast|simultaneously]] or time-shifted – outside of peak hours. These programmes were provided to S4C by Channel 4, free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Channel 4|first=Peter|last=Catterall|page=51|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|ISBN=978-0-7146-4926-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make content more accessible to English speakers, all Welsh-language programming carries English subtitles. Originally these were on [[Teletext]] page 888, with Welsh subtitles on page 889, with both subtitle languages now also available on digital television platforms. For speakers of English who are learning Welsh, certain programmes, particularly children's programmes ''Planed Plant Bach'' and ''Planed Plant'', carry subtitles featuring Welsh subtitles with additional English translations in brackets next to more difficult Welsh-language words. TV films produced for S4C have received some good foreign reviews; ''[[Hedd Wyn (film)|Hedd Wyn]]'' was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Oscar in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1994 | title = The 66th Academy Awards 1994 | website = oscars.org | publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | location = Los Angeles, CA | access-date = 27 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Solomon &amp; Gaenor]]'' was nominated in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2000 | title = The 72nd Academy Awards 2000 | website = oscars.org | publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | location = Los Angeles, CA  | access-date = 27 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The S4C analogue signal also spilled over on to the east coast of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. In the past it was rebroadcast in a number of areas there on [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] terrestrial signals by so-called '[[Television in the Republic of Ireland#Deflectors|deflectors]]'. Up until the 1990s, S4C was also carried by some Irish [[cable television|cable]] and [[MMDS]] providers before being replaced by Channel 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.askcomreg.ie/other/pay_tv.25.LE.asp |title=Ask Comreg - Pay TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The S4C channels continue to be available the Republic of Ireland via the Freesat satellite service.

Up until 2009, S4C ran its own [[teletext]] service, [[Sbectel]] (''"Sbec"'', Welsh for "a peek" or "a glimpse", and a reference to an S4C schedule insert formerly included in the ''[[TV Times]]'' issues for the HTV Wales region).

== Viewing figures ==
9.4&amp;nbsp;million people viewed the channel throughout the UK during 2017-2018, with 690,000 viewers throughout the UK in an average week.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There were also 37 million viewing sessions of S4C content on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in 2017-2018, with 8.2&amp;nbsp;million viewing sessions of S4C content on S4C Arlein and BBC iPlayer. 

On a typical week in 2017, approximately 364,000 viewers in Wales watched the channel on television for at least three consecutive minutes – the highest level of reach since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/media/media-releases/2018/broadcast-tv-viewing-wales|title=Broadcast TV viewing declines in Wales|website=Ofcom|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 166,000 Welsh speakers in Wales watched S4C each week in 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Digital channels==
Following the switch-off of analogue terrestrial signals on 31 March 2010, Wales became the first fully digital region in the UK, with both S4C and Channel 4 becoming available to all homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=S4C Holds a Special Position in the TV Advertising Market|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-222523953.html|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|date=31 March 2010|accessdate=7 April 2016|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, S4C now broadcasts solely in the Welsh language and, as well as on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] in Wales, is available throughout Britain, Ireland and the rest of western Europe on [[Freesat]] and [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]]. A review commissioned by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] in 2004 suggested that "S4C should operate a single core service after digital switchover".&lt;ref name=Laughton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laughton|first=Roger|title=S4C:An Independent Review|page=32|publisher=Department for Culture, Media and Sport|date=July 2004|accessdate=29 January 2009|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/abouts4c/authority/pdf/e_adolygiad_laughton.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:S4C2logo.svg|right|thumb|Logo of the former channel S4C2]]
In addition, S4C also operated a sister channel, [[S4C2]] until 2010. It formerly broadcast coverage of the [[National Assembly for Wales]] when in session. The programme content was provided by the [[BBC]] who, from January 2010, now make it available online and via [[BBC Parliament]]. Like the main channel, S4C2 was available within Wales on Freeview and throughout the UK and Ireland on Freesat and Sky. S4C2 had two audio feeds, allowing viewers to select between an untranslated version and an English-only version where all Welsh spoken is translated into English. Delayed coverage of Assembly proceedings is now broadcast overnight on S4C's main channel on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursday. In addition to the analogue TV signal transmitted throughout Wales, S4C, along with [[UBM plc|United News &amp; Media]], owned the company [[S4C Digital Networks]] (SDN). SDN was awarded the UK-wide contract to provide half a digital multiplex worth of programming. The other half continues to belong to the broadcaster [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

On 27 April 2005 S4C sold its share of SDN to [[ITV plc]] for approximately £34&amp;nbsp;million, though it still has the half-multiplex as of right in Wales. ITV already owned some of SDN due to the consolidation of the ITV industry: Granada bought UNM's stake in SDN, and this was then incorporated into the united ITV plc. In January 2007, S4C announced plans to launch a Welsh-language children's service.&lt;ref name="S4C announce children's channel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/s4c_unveils_kids_channel_and_rebrand.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419222821/http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/s4c_unveils_kids_channel_and_rebrand.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 April 2013|title=S4C unveils kids' channel and rebrand|accessdate=28 October 2007|date=20 January 2007|publisher=Broadcast Now (subscription required to view article)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new service, in the form of a programming block, launched on 23 June 2008. Under the name [[Cyw]] (chick), it brings together a wide range of programmes for nursery-age children, and S4C plans eventually to extend the service to include the [[Stwnsh]] strand for older children and a third service for teenagers and young people. The service currently airs on weekdays from 7&amp;nbsp;am to 1.30&amp;nbsp;pm on S4C.

S4C launched a high-definition simulcast of S4C called 'Clirlun' on 19 July 2010 to coincide with terrestrial digital switchover in Wales.&lt;ref name="S4C Press Release: S4C Clirlun now available throughout Wales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/e_press_level2.shtml?id=351|title=S4C Press Release: S4C Clirlun now available throughout Wales|date=19 July 2010|publisher=S4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clirlun was broadcast on Freeview channel 53 only, and not via other platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/clirlun/e_index.shtml|title=Clirlun|publisher=S4C|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405192725/http://www.s4c.co.uk/clirlun/e_index.shtml|archivedate=5 April 2010|deadurl=yes|accessdate=12 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clirlun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/e_press_level2.shtml?id=324|title=S4C launches new High Definition channel - Clirlun|date=29 March 2010|publisher=S4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following funding cuts and a review of core services it was announced on 11 July 2012 that Clirlun would close before the end of the year.&lt;ref name="S4C Press Release: S4C efficiency measures on course to meet targets"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/e_press_level2.shtml?id=665|title=S4C Press Release: S4C efficiency measures on course to meet targets|date=11 July 2012|publisher=S4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/e_press_level2.shtml?id=665|title=S4C efficiency measures on course to meet targets|publisher=S4C authority|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clirlun closed at midnight on the evening of 1 December 2012, with Channel 4 HD taking over its transmission capacity with effect from the next day, 2 December 2012.&lt;ref name="C4HD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/spectrum/spectrum-policy-area/projects/dtv/Amendment_to_Determination.pdf|title=Amendment 1 to the Determination Under Article 3 of the Television Multiplex Services (Reservation of Digital Capacity) Order 2008 Dated 17 October 2008|date=2 October 2012|publisher=Ofcom}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced on 20 May 2016 that S4C would relaunch a high-definition service S4C HD on Freesat and Sky in Wales and across the UK from 7 June onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/s4c-bring-back-hd-service-11357722|title=S4C will bring back its HD service just in time for Euro 2016|publisher=S4C|date=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presentation==

{{Overly detailed|date=January 2017|section=yes}}

===1982–1988===
[[File:S4C 1982 logo.svg|thumb|right|S4C's first logo, used from 1 November 1982 to 30 September 1988]]
On 1 November 1982, S4C's on-air appearance has always been a representation of the Welsh society and people, but this representation has changed several times. Initial idents featured clips from the natural landscapes of Wales with a basic logo animation and fanfare, with the logo forming as ''WALE'''S4C'''YMRU''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa6aQpkyzeY|title=WALES4CYMRU Welcome 1982|date=8 August 2010|work=YouTube|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were several clock idents for the news and closedown.

===1987–1993===
[[File:S4C logo 1988-1995.svg|thumb|left|200px|S4C's second logo, used from 8 September 1987 to 9 February 1995]]
On 8 September 1987, the ident changed to a computer-generated ident featuring an animation of the streamlined S4C logo, the colours of the logo were blue, green and red and the font was Bodoni. There was also a clock ident.

On 7 September 1990, the new ident was introduced, depicting a piece of Welsh slate with colour blue, green and red washing over the letters S4C. There were several versions for this ident. From 1 November 1991 onwards, the music had a sombre violin and a bombastic fanfare. This ident with sombre music was used for S4C Clasuron Fideo in circa. 1992 until 1993. There were two different clock idents, first the grey coloured one until 1992, and the final with in gold colour until 4 September 1993.

===1993–2007===
[[File:S4Clogo 1995-2007.svg|thumb|140px|right|S4C's third logo, used from 10 February 1995 to 17 January 2007]]
On 5 September 1993, S4C introduced a new series of idents, which depicted inanimate objects as having characteristics of dragons (such as flight or breathing fire), as a reference to the red dragon on the [[flag of Wales]]. On 10 February 1995, the channel introduced a new logo, featuring a [[tilde]] representing a dragon.

Inanimate objects in the idents were a kite, a man dressed as a dragon with a staff, flags to become the Welsh dragon, an oxy-acetylene gas pump dragon, a pair of scissors (the tongs variant was also made), the clockwork dragon (schools programming), a sousaphone, a standpipe, an extinguisher (the close up version was also made), a clothes iron, a pencil (the fire version was also made), an electric fan, a pedal bin, a curly light on the pole, a spray can, the countdown screen (sports programming), the tiled carousel (schools programming, the colour version was made until the summer term of 2000, in the autumn term of 2000 onwards, the monochrome version was made), a vacuum cleaner, a mouse (the special preview screen was also made), a stapler with a red ribbon, a garlic crusher, a magic top hat, a lawnmower, a shower, two Sunday Night drama idents, an egg cup (the short version was also made), a loudspeaker and the Chwareon/Sports ident.

Special idents were the Christmas idents, St. David's Day idents, a Kangaroo dragon flag ident for the Rugby World Cup 2003, Mawr (ITV Ident in 2004), Cofio 60, Eisteddfod idents and Big Brother 7 final.

The clockwork dragon ident was discontinued by June 1999. 

The variants (such as the shots, angles and music) for the idents were the entertainment dragon, the dragon man, the scissors, the sousaphone, the extinguisher, the pencil, the fan, the tiled carousel and the egg cup idents.

The entertainment dragon, the gas pump dragon and the spray can idents were discontinued by 2000.

The new sports ident named Chwareon S4C Sport replaced the countdown screen in October 2004.

The entertainment/flags ident was used for S4C Clasuron Fideo in 1993 - 1997.

The dragon idents were withdrawn on 31 December 2006.

The clock idents changed in 1993, 1995 (the same clock from 1993, with the new logo), 1999, 2000, 2002, 2005 and 2006. There were also Christmas versions for the clock idents.

From 1 January 2007 to 16 January, temporary idents were used which gave a nod towards what was to come for the new presentation on the station. It was called 'A new direction'.

The 1995 S4C logo was withdrawn on 17 January 2007. 

This was the last S4C logo to include the clock ident.

===2007–2014===
[[File:S4C logo.svg|thumb|S4C's fourth logo, used from 18 January 2007 to 9 April 2014]]
On 18 January 2007, S4C announced that their digital channels would be refreshed with a new corporate logo and brand. The new branding was implemented online on 17 January, with S4C's television channels adopting it the next day. The new branding, developed by the London-based firm Proud Creative, was intended to portray S4C as a more "contemporary" multi-platform broadcaster, and downplayed "traditional" Welsh imagery such as dragons. Its idents were filmed around various parts of the country, and themed around magnetism—representing the "uncontrollable attraction" of Welsh people and their "emotional affinity to the homeland, whether near or far."&lt;ref name=guardian-s4crevamp&gt;{{cite web|title=Branding revamp for S4C|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/18/marketingandpr.broadcasting|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S4C announce rebrand"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.ca/media/news/a41509/s4c-gets-a-rebrand.html|title=S4C gets a rebrand|accessdate=11 January 2007|last=Oatts|first=Joanne|date=9 January 2007|publisher=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetism-themed idents were later replaced by a new set developed in collaboration with the agency Minivegas, consisting of live-action scenes with dynamic, animated elements that can react to the voice of the continuity announcer.&lt;ref name=mv-idents&gt;{{cite web|title=S4C Interactive Idents|url=http://minivegas.net/projects/s4c/|work=Minivegas|accessdate=10 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413125221/http://minivegas.net/projects/s4c/|archivedate=13 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014–present===
A new S4C logo and brand developed by Sugar Creative Studio was introduced on 10 April 2014; the new design was developed around a concept of providing "context" to S4C's target audience and programming. The design revolves heavily around a trapezoidal shape used within the channel's new logo, which is prominently used within aspects of the channel's overall marketing and branding.&lt;ref name=sugar-news4c&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing a new identity for S4C designed by Sugar Creative Studio|url=http://s4c.sugarcs.com/|publisher=Sugar Creative Studio|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
S4C has faced criticism for poor viewing figures since its launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plaid protester's S4C lament|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2384025.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=1 November 2002|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaked internal reports in March 2010 showed that "over the 20-day period from February 15 to last Saturday, March 6, as many as 196 of the 890 programmes put out by S4C were rated as having "zero viewers". The story was widely reported across the UK and referenced in parliament by the then [[Culture Secretary]] [[Jeremy Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shipton |first=Martin |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2010/03/10/figures-reveal-failure-of-s4c-to-attract-tv-audiences-91466-25999157/ |title=Figures reveal failure of S4C to attract TV audiences |publisher=WalesOnline |date=10 March 2010 |accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The £100m taxpayer-funded Welsh TV channel where one in four shows get ZERO viewers|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1257157/The-100m-Welsh-TV-channel-shows-ZERO-viewers.html|website=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, an S4C spokesperson stated that 90% of those programmes were aimed at pre-school children, and that BARB (the organisation that compiles television ratings in the UK) only takes into account viewers aged four years and over. The remaining 10% consisted of repeats and daytime news bulletins which did not attract the minimum 1,000 viewers necessary to register on a UK-wide analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/columnists/2010/11/04/these-are-the-facts-about-s4c-but-why-let-them-spoil-a-good-headline-91466-27600820|title=These are the facts about S4C, but why let them spoil a good headline?|date=4 November 2010|last=Evans|first=Carys|work=WalesOnline.co.uk|publisher=Media Wales Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July 2010, S4C's chief executive Iona Jones left her post without explanation. Assembly members and Members of Parliament requested an independent investigation into the circumstances leading up to her departure. The S4C Authority refused to comment further and commissioned a review into how the broadcaster was governed in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s4c.co.uk/e_press_level2.shtml?id=364 Sir Jon Shortridge appointed to undertake S4C corporate governance review], S4C press release, 19 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 February 2011, it was announced that issues between Iona Jones and S4C had been settled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s4c.co.uk/e_press_level2.shtml?id=464 Iona Jones - No Tribunal] S4C official press release, 3 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 February 2011, the Shortridge Report on corporate governance was made public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s4c.co.uk/abouts4c/authority/pdf/adolygiad_o_lywodraethiant_corfforaethol-s4c.pdf Review of the Corporate Governance of S4C] on official website, 11 February 2011. (The English version begins at page 54.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==
S4C appointed its first female CEO, [[Iona Jones]] in 2005.

Owen Evans, previously the deputy permanent secretary to the [[Welsh Government]], became chief executive in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-39928086|title=Owen Evans appointed as new S4C chief executive|date=2017-05-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.s4c.cymru/en/about-us/page/17266/s4c-strategic-board/|title=About us {{!}} S4C|website=www.s4c.cymru|language=en|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding and regulation==
From its inception S4C was part publicly-financed: funding came both from its advertising revenue and a fixed annual grant from the UK [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS), receiving £90m of funding in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S4C Annual Report 2011|work=www.s4c.co.uk|publisher=S4C|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/abouts4c/annualreport/acrobats/s4c-annual-report-2011.pdf|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some Welsh-language programming (including ''[[Newyddion]]'' and ''[[Pobol y Cwm]]'') was produced by [[BBC Wales]] as part of the [[BBC]]'s [[Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|public service]] remit, and provided to S4C free of charge. There is an agreement in place until 2022 for 10 hours a week of programming to be provided to S4C, which is valued at £19.4m annually.

From 2013, responsibility for funding S4C began to transfer to the BBC, with the DCMS reducing its funding by 94% by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11696905|work=BBC News|title=S4C brings £90m to Welsh economy, finds new research|date=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC will provide around £76m of funding to S4C by this date, resulting in a cut of around 25% to S4C's annual budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11581346|work=BBC News|title=S4C seeks judicial review over BBC funding move|date=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, it was agreed that the BBC would provide £74.5m a year funding to S4C from the licence fee until 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-37300406|title=S4C £74.5m funding confirmed until 2022|date=7 September 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Government announced in 2018 that it would continue providing £6.72m until 2020, with the aim of S4C being funded wholly from the licence fee from 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-future-of-s4c|title=The future of S4C|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would see S4C's funding being decided as part of the licence fee settlement, for 10 year periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-43569372|title=S4C set to lose its government funding|first=David|last=Cornock|date=29 March 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to public funding, S4C generates around 2% of its income through commercial sources, such as [[Television advertisement|advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.cymru/en/about-us/introducing-s4c/page/17280/introducing-s4c/|title=Introducing S4C - S4C|website=www.s4c.cymru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S4C is controlled by the [[S4C Authority]] (''Awdurdod S4C''), an independent body unconnected to [[Ofcom]], the regulator of other UK television channels such as ITV and Channel 4.

==Catch-up==
[[File:S4C Catch Up.png|200px|right|Clic]]
S4C maintains its own catch-up service called '''Clic'''. Clic is a free online [[video on demand]] service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/clic/e_faqs.shtml|title=Questions about Clic|publisher=S4C|accessdate=26 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905045739/http://www.s4c.co.uk/clic/e_faqs.shtml|archivedate=5 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offers live-streaming, [[Sign language|signed]] programming, a 35-day catch-up service, and archive programming. Clic is available across the U.K. but also contains a limited selection of worldwide programming. Clic's catch-up service is split into seven categories: Drama, Entertainment, Factual and Arts, Music, Sport, and two Children's categories,  [[Cyw]] (ages 3–6) and [[Stwnsh]] (ages 7–13). A Clic app was released for [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] devices on 18 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/e_press_level2.shtml?id=550|title=S4C Clic app now available for the iPad|publisher=S4C|date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2014 S4C's programmes and live-streaming also became available to view on the BBC's catch-up service, BBC iPlayer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/s4c-comes-to-bbc-iplayer-8237804|title=S4C comes to BBC iPlayer|first=Sion|last=Morgan|date=5 December 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Both services offer English and Welsh subtitles to some shows. 

There were 8.2 million viewing sessions to S4C content on Clic and BBC iPlayer in 2017-2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was an increase of 600,000 from the 7.6 million viewing sessions on those platforms in 2016-2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-40644393|title=S4C 'reaching new audiences'|last=Thomas|first=Huw|date=2017-07-18|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solomon Feferman''' (December 13, 1928 – July 26, 2016)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.illc.uva.nl/LogicList/newsitem.php?id=7645&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[philosopher]] and [[mathematician]] with works in [[mathematical logic]]. 

==Biography==
Feferman was born in [[The Bronx]] in [[New York City]] from working class parents who had emigrated to the United States after [[World War I]] and had met and married in New York. Neither had any advanced education.  The family moved to Los Angeles, where Feferman graduated from high school at age 16. He received his B.S. from the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1948 and his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1957 from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] under [[Alfred Tarski]],&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=19858}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being drafted from 1953 to 1955. In 1956 he was hired with appointments in the Departments of Mathematics and Philosophy at [[Stanford University]], where later he became the [[Patrick Suppes]] Professor of Humanities and Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20171024072327/http://math.stanford.edu/~feferman&lt;/ref&gt;

Feferman was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1972 and 1986&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/solomon-feferman/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Schock Prize]] in logic and philosophy in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.stanford.edu/news/2003/june4/feferman-64.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was invited to deliver the [https://math.berkeley.edu/about/events/lectures/tarski Tarski Lectures] in 2006. In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved December 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feferman was the editor-in-chief of the five volumes of ''Collected Works'' of [[Kurt Gödel]] that were published by Oxford University Press between 2001 and 2013.

Together with his wife Anita Burdman Feferman, he wrote a biography of [[Alfred Tarski]]: ''Alfred Tarski: Life and Logic'' in 2004.

He worked on predicative mathematics, and in particular introduced the [[Feferman–Schütte ordinal]] as a measure of the strength of certain predicative systems.

'''Spook Hill''' is a [[gravity hill]], an [[optical illusion]] where cars appear to roll up the spooky hill in [[Lake Wales, Florida]].

Spook Hill is located on the [[Lake Wales Ridge National Wildlife Refuge|Lake Wales Ridge]], a [[geology|geologically]] significant range of sand and [[limestone]] hills, which were islands from two to three million years ago, when [[sea level]]s were much higher than at present.

The attraction is adjacent to Spook Hill Elementary School, which adopted [[Casper The Friendly Ghost]] as their school mascot. The attraction is also in close proximity to [[Bok Tower Gardens|Bok Tower]].

Spook Hill received national media attention when an article about it appeared on the front page of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' on October 25, 1990, and it was featured in a segment on ''[[CBS Morning News]]'' with [[Charles Osgood]] on November 5, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabayskeptics.org/Spook_Hill.html Tampa Bay Skeptics: Do cars really roll up Spook Hill?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
While watching a production of ''[[King Lear]]'' at the [[Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres|Elgin Theatre]] in [[Toronto]], Jeevan watches as the actor playing Lear, Arthur Leander, has a heart attack. Since he has begun training as a paramedic, Jeevan tries to resuscitate Arthur but is unsuccessful. Instead he comforts one of the child actors in the production, Kirsten. After leaving the play Jeevan goes for a walk in the snow and receives a call from one of his doctor friends. This friend warns him to get out of the city as a mysterious Georgia flu is spreading rapidly and will soon become a full out epidemic. Jeevan loads up on supplies and goes to stay with his brother. We find out that many of the actors, actresses and others that had gathered to mourn Arthur's death die within three weeks of the beginning epidemic.

Twenty years later Kirsten Raymonde is part of a nomadic group of actors and musicians known as the Travelling Symphony. Kirsten, who was eight at the time of the plague, can remember little of her life before Year Zero but clings to a two volume set of graphic novels given to her by Arthur before his death called ''Dr. Eleven''. The troupe operates on a two-year cycle orbiting around the [[Great Lakes region]] and during this time Kirsten scavenges abandoned homes looking for old tabloid magazines for traces of Arthur. After returning to a small town where they left their pregnant friend, Charlie, and her husband, Jeremy, the troupe is disturbed to find that not only are their friends missing but the town is under the control of the mysterious Prophet, who rapes young girls that he claims as his "wives". The troupe quickly leaves and is determined to go off route to the Museum of Civilization, which is actually a former airport, where they believe they might find their missing friends. However, en route they discover a young stowaway who left the town as she was promised to the Prophet as his bride. Shortly after, members of the troupe begin to disappear until finally the entire troupe is gone leaving only Kirsten and her friend August. Frightened, they continue on to the Museum hoping to be reunited with others.

Unbeknownst to Kirsten the graphic novel ''Dr. Eleven'' was written by Arthur's first wife, Miranda. Fourteen years before the collapse of civilization Miranda left an abusive relationship with an artist and married Arthur. However as Arthur's fame hit its peak Miranda realized he was having an affair with a blonde woman who would become his second wife, Elizabeth. The night that Miranda discovers the affair she walks out of her home and asks the paparazzo outside if he has a cigarette. The paparazzo turns out be Jeevan. Years later, when Jeevan is trying to reinvent himself as an entertainment journalist Arthur gives him the exclusive that he is leaving Elizabeth and his young child to be with his co-star of his new movie Lydia Marks. Jeevan reflects on this while he and his brother Frank are locked in Frank's apartment waiting for the epidemic to run its course. After a while they realize that no one is coming to save them. Frank, a paraplegic, commits suicide in order to allow his brother to move freely. Jeevan embarks on a journey south and eventually finds a new settlement where he marries and becomes the town doctor.

Meanwhile, back in Year Zero, Clark, one of Arthur's friends, is the one who informs Elizabeth that Arthur is dead. Clark, Elizabeth and Elizabeth's son, Tyler, happen to be on the same flight from New York to [[Toronto]] to go to Arthur's funeral when it is redirected to the fictional Severn City Airport due to the epidemic.  Clark ends up resettling in the airport post-pandemic and becomes the "curator" of the Museum of Civilization where he gathers artifacts such as iPhones and laptops and explains to children born post-pandemic what they did. While most of the airport survivors manage to eke out an existence and cope with their new life Elizabeth and Tyler grow increasingly religious and strange, believing that the epidemic happened for a reason and spared those who were good. They finally leave in Year Two with a religious cult.

Back in Year Twenty Kirsten and August meet a group of the Prophet's men along with Sayid, one of the members of their troupe. They manage to kill the men and free Sayid who informs them that one of their friends, Dieter, was killed and that the hostage that the Prophet's men took to replace Dieter managed to escape and warn the troupe, explaining how Kirsten and August were unable to find them. Frightened, Kirsten, August and Sayid try to hurry towards the Severn City Airport. Kirsten however is discovered by the Prophet himself, whose dog she realizes has the same name as Dr. Eleven's in the Dr. Eleven comics. Just before the Prophet is about to kill her he speaks some lines that she recognizes from ''Dr. Eleven''. She quotes some back to him, distracting him long enough that one of his younger sentries, who does not want to be a part of his cult, shoots and kills the Prophet before taking his own life. Kirsten and the rest continue on to the Museum of Civilization where they are reunited with Charlie, Jeremy and the rest of the troupe. Clark, who has stayed at the museum for twenty years, realizes who Kirsten is, her attachment to Arthur, and that the Prophet is the grown up Tyler. Furthermore, he shows Kirsten from the watch tower of the airport there is a town to the south that uses electricity, showing that civilization is beginning to take root again.

Five weeks later Kirsten leaves with the theatre troupe for the south. She leaves one volume of ''Dr. Eleven'' with Clark who begins to read it and recognizes a scene in the graphic novel that is borrowed from a dinner party which he, Arthur and Miranda once attended.

==Genre==
Although many publications classified the novel as science fiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/06/20/415782006/survival-is-insufficient-station-eleven-preserves-art-after-the-apocalypse|title=Survival Is Insufficient: 'Station Eleven' Preserves Art After The Apocalypse|last=NPR Staff|date=20 June 2015|publisher=NPR|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/the-best-science-fiction-and-fantasy-books-of-2014-1676427116|title=The Best Science Fiction And Fantasy Books Of 2014|last=Andrews|first=Charlie Jane|date=30 December 2014|publisher=io9|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/sci-fi-and-fantasy-by-emily-st-john-mandel-robert-jackson-bennett-lauren-beukes/2014/09/16/eccb11ca-3785-11e4-bdfb-de4104544a37_story.html|title=Sci-fi &amp; fantasy by Emily St. John Mandel, Robert Jackson Bennett, Lauren Beukes|last=Hightower|first=Nancy|date=16 September 2014|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandel herself does not believe that the work belongs to that genre, as the novel does not include any instances of fictional technology.&lt;ref name=wsjII&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/10/15/sorry-emily-st-john-mandel-resistance-is-futile/|title=Sorry, Emily St. John Mandel: Resistance is futile|last=Charles|first=Ron|date=15 October 2015|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/EmilyMandel/status/522377635582967808|title=Great piece.

==Film adaptation==
A film adaptation of the novel is in development by [[Scott Steindorff]], producer of adaptations such as [[Love in the Time of Cholera (film)|''Love in the Time of Cholera'']] and [[The Human Stain (film)|''The Human Stain'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/best-seller-station-eleven-acquired-772214|title=Best-Seller 'Station Eleven' Acquired by 'Jane Got a Gun' Producer|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=2015-02-10|accessdate=2015-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Szpilman Award''' is an annual art prize. It is awarded to works that exist only for a moment or a short period of time. The purpose of the award is to promote such works whose forms consist of [[ephemeral]] situations.&lt;ref&gt;Nunez-Fernandez, Lupe:  [http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/blogon/2007/05/mahony_at_austrian_cultural_fo.php "Mahony at Austrian Cultural Forum"] ''Saatchi Online'', 9 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first presented in 2003 and is still the only award for ephemeral works worldwide.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} The prize is open for the public.

==Background==

The ''Szpilman Award'' is initiated, financed and organized by German-based art group ''Szpilman''. It was founded in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Grit: Szpilman Award, ''art kaleidoscope'', page 23, January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially only people from [[Germany]] could apply. Regulations were changed in 2004 and opened the call for [[Europe]]. The public interest in the prize raised. In 2006 ''Szpilman'' abolished any restrictions: everyone from all over the world&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.szquirrel.szpilman.de/informations.html "Who participates in the Szpilman Award? "] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225213202/http://www.szquirrel.szpilman.de/informations.html |date=2008-12-25 }} ''Szpilman Award: Information'', viewed: 12 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; can apply now for the ''Szpilman Award''. The winner is chosen by a panel of up to 10 independent judges including the winner of the previous year. The prize is accompanied with a dynamic cash award (sum of money collected by members of the jury parallel to the competition, called "Jackpot Stipendium"), a trip to [[Cimochowizna]] ([[Poland]]), and a challenge cup whichwill be handed over to the next prize winner in the subsequent year.&lt;ref&gt;Vvoi:  [http://new-art.blogspot.com/2007/05/szpilman-award-carpe-diem-one-ephemeral.html "Szpilman Award: carpe diem, one ephemeral step at a time"] ''New Art'' blog, 16 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008 the ''Szpilman Award'' is also running a daily bulletin about ephemeral works, called "Potz!Blitz!Szpilman!".&lt;ref&gt;"In love with ephemeral" Sleek Magazine No.22, page 94, September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

To make ephemeral works more public and to show a greater variety of possibilities members of ''Szpilman Award'' curate exhibitions since 2006 in cities all around the world, called Szpilman Award Shows, e.g. in galleries, museums and public spaces in Austria, Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mer spingkse, wat kütt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4581">'''The Japanese Art Society of America''' (JASA) promotes the study and appreciation of [[Japanese art]]. Founded in 1973 as the Ukiyo-e Society of America by collectors of [[woodblock printing in Japan|Japanese prints]], the Society's mission has expanded to include related fields of Japanese art.

==History==
While the Society now addresses all aspects of Japanese art and culture, it traces its origins to a small group of [[ukiyo-e]] print collectors in and around New York City in 1973, at a time when Parke-Bernet Galleries (later to merge with [[Sotheby's]]) had begun to develop a market for Japanese art. The first major auction was the 1969 sale of the Blanche McFetridge estate, consisting of ukiyo-e prints once owned by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], followed by the 1972 sale of the estate of Hans Popper (1904–1971), a Viennese businessman who spent time working in Japan. His collection included masterpieces by [[Harunobu]], [[Utamaro]], [[Sharaku]] and [[Hokusai]], and the sale attracted many of the great collectors and dealers of the era, including [[Richard Pillsbury Gale]] (1900–1973) in Minnesota, [[Felix Tikotin]] (1893–1986), a dealer living in Switzerland, and Nishi Saiju (1927–1995), the first Japanese dealer to attend a sale in the United States.

JASA entered its fourth decade under the direction of [[Joan Baekeland]] as president, and the long-time Chicago collector George Mann as vice president. The current president is Dr. Susan Peters. Today, JASA has some 400 members from countries around the world, including Japan.

==Activities==
Through its annual lectures, seminars and other events, the Society provides a forum for the exchange ideas and experiences about traditional and contemporary arts of Japan.

The Society also sponsors exhibitions, such as ''Designed for Pleasure: The World of Edo Japan in Prints and Paintings, 1680–1860'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://asiasociety.org/media/press-releases/asia-society-presents-major-exhibition-japanese-woodblock-prints-and-paintings/ Asia Society Presents Major Exhibition of Japanese Woodblock Prints And Paintings]&lt;/ref&gt; which was shown at Asia Society in New York City in Spring 2008.

==Programs and publications==
Programs for members and the public remain the focus of the Society: in 2009, for example, members had tea in the Japanese teahouse at [[Kykuit]], the Rockefeller estate in Pocantico Hills near Tarrytown, New York; visited private and public collections in Sacramento and San Francisco; and toured the Richard Fishbein and Estelle Bender Collection as well as the mini-museum of the [[Mary Griggs Burke|Mary Griggs Burke Collection]] in New York City. Lecture programs in New York are held at the [[New York University Institute of Fine Arts]] and elsewhere. 

The programs and publications of the Society were valuable in the 1970s, when ukiyo-e studies and, for that matter, [[Edo period]] art history had scarcely entered the academic mainstream either in the United States or Japan.{{cn|date=January 2015}} 

The society publishes a quarterly newsletter for members as well as an annual journal, ''Impressions.'' ({{ISSN|1095-2136}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japaneseartsoc.org/publications.htm/ Japanese Art Society publications]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Art Index'', Jan. 2010, New York, H. W. Wilson Co., Vol. 81, No. 1, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Impressions'' was the recipient of the 2009 Donald Keene Prize for the Promotion of Japanese Culture,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keenecenter.org/content/view/53/75/ 2009 Donald Keene Prize for the Promotion of Japanese Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; awarded by the [[Donald Keene]] Center, [[Columbia University]].

==Biography==
Gharavi was born in Tehran and is based in the UK and Los Angeles. She was raised in the UK, New Zealand, New Jersey and studied filmmaking in France at [[Le Fresnoy]] studio national des arts contemporains near Lille, France. In 1998 Gharavi set up the film company, ''Bridge + Tunnel Productions'', based in Newcastle upon Tyne, [[England]].  In 2000, Gharavi set up the ''Kooch Cinema Group'', a media training project, for asylum seekers and refugee participants; a project started after returning to Iran to make a [[Channel Four]] commissioned documentary, ''Mother/Country'', where she revisited her mother's house after 23 years. In 2005, she established a separate media charity, ''Bridge + Tunnel Voices'', to undertake the charitable and educational work she initiated mainly working with refugees and asylum seekers; stepping down as the lead creative director in 2015. In 2014, she  established ''Bridge + Tunnel France'' in Paris, with her partner, James Richard Baillie, to specialise in European co-productions.  Gharavi has been awarded a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] Fellowship (2003), received a UK Arts Council Decibel Spotlight Award and served as a diversity champion for a variety of organisations as trustee (UK Refugee Council, Arts Council North-East, Tyneside Cinema and BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Arts). Gharavi is an Associate Professor (Senior Lecturer) in Film &amp; Digital Media at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle]]. She is a previous Fellow of the [[MIT]] Documentary Lab in Boston and was invited to join the [[BAFTA]] Academy in 2017.

==Reviews==
[[Peter Bradshaw]] 4-star review of ''I Am Nasrine'' in The Guardian:

{{quote| The Bafta-nominated debut tells its story of Iranian emigrants to Britain with integrity and feeling... A valuable debut, shot with a fluent kind of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/13/i-am-nasrine-review|title=I Am Nasrine – review|work=the Guardian|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jackie Kay]], poet, has said of ''I Am Nasrine'':

{{quote|...I Am Nasrine is a tender and affecting coming of age movie... Heartening and uplifting to come across an Iranian woman filmmaker with Gharavi's magical yet methodical talent.}}

[[Sir Ben Kingsley]] has said of ''I Am Nasrine'':

{{quote|...In our economic climate this is a film of vital importance. It is now, in this uncertain climate, that the innocent strangers in our midst could so easily be victimised... It has always been my experience that when one's motives are pure, the angels will come. Having met Tina and talked about her aspirations for this film, I know her motives are pure. She aims to make a life enhancing film. An important and much needed film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/interview-award-winning-filmmaker-tina-gharavi-4421426|title=Interview: Award-winning filmmaker Tina Gharavi|author=|publisher=Thejournal.co.uk|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Mark Cousins (film critic)|Mark Cousins]] writing about  ''I Am Nasrine'':  

{{quote| ...It made me cry.  It is a film that captures the beauty of human interactions - tentative and curious - and is full of ideas about how to frame and tell a story.  i really admired the ellipses in your film, the boldness with which you jumped forward, and what you left out.  And, of course, it is profoundly relevant and puts to shame many portayals of Iranian people.}}

Shari Frilot, Sundance programmer, has said of ''Closer'':

{{quote|...it takes documentary to the next level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madcatfilmfestival.org/archives2000.html|title=MADCAT WOMEN'S INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL|publisher=Madcatfilmfestival.org|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In The London Evening Standard it was said of ''Mother/Country'':

{{quote|...This documentary alone justifies the Alt-TV Strand.}}

In the jury statement announced by Jiří Hubička as part of One World Film Festival, The Czech Radio Award, it was said:

{{quote|The jury agreed that within the collection of documentaries, the film Closer is a work of great creativity. The director uses with amazing sensitivity a large scale of real sounds and music of different types and genres (electronic, techno, modern artificial music) to underline the distinct and meaningful changes in the atmosphere. The manipulation of authentic sound almost to the extent that there is total silence is particularly compelling in the central scene of the film in which there is an intimate discussion between mother and daughter. The use of sound exponentiates the message of the film, which is a testimony about an uneasy way to find one_s identity, and the ability to overcome prejudices set by generational differences and other barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneworld.cz/ow/2003/en/news/ |accessdate=October 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012043824/http://www.oneworld.cz/ow/2003/en/news/ |title= One World Festival| archivedate=October 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Palais des etudes ensba paris 003.jpg|thumb|Palais des études of the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris]]

An '''École des Beaux-Arts''' ({{IPA-fr|ekɔl de bozaʁ}}, ''School of Fine Arts'') is one of a number of influential [[art school]]s in France. The most famous is the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]], now located on the [[Rive Gauche|left bank]] in Paris, across the [[Seine]] from the [[Louvre]], at 14 [[rue Bonaparte]] (in the [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]]). The school has a history spanning more than 350 years, training many of the great artists in Europe. [[Fine art|Beaux Arts]] style was modeled on classical "[[Classical antiquity|antiquities]]", preserving these idealized forms and passing the style on to future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre Bourdieu|title=The State Nobility: Elite Schools in the Field of Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=do9o-jIrzXgC&amp;pg=PA133|year=1998|publisher=Stanford UP|pages=133–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origins of the school go back to 1648 when the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] was founded by [[Cardinal Mazarin]] to educate the most talented students in drawing, painting, sculpture, engraving, architecture and other media. [[Louis XIV]] was known to select graduates from the school to decorate the royal apartments at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], and in 1863 [[Napoleon III]] granted the school independence from the government, changing the name to "L'École des Beaux-Arts". Women were admitted beginning in 1897.

The curriculum was divided into the "Academy of Painting and Sculpture" and the "Academy of Architecture". Both programs focused on classical arts and architecture from Ancient Greek and Roman culture. All students were required to prove their skills with basic drawing tasks before advancing to figure drawing and painting. This culminated in a competition for the ''Grand Prix de Rome'', awarding a full scholarship to study in Rome. The three trials to obtain the prize lasted for nearly three months. [http://www.culture.gouv.fr/ENSBA/trials.html] Many of the most famous artists in Europe were trained here, to name but a few, they include [[Théodore Géricault|Géricault]], [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]], [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Gustave Moreau|Moreau]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Seurat]], [[A.M. Cassandre|Cassandre]], and [[Alfred Sisley|Sisley]].  [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] however, applied on three occasions but was refused entry.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news
| title = Rodin, Famous Sculptor, Dead
| work = The New York Times
| page = E3
| date = 18 November 1917
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buildings of the school are largely the creation of French architect [[Félix Duban]], who was commissioned for the main building in 1830. His work realigned the campus, and continued through 1861, completing an architectural program out towards the Quai Malaquais.

The Paris school is the namesake and founding location of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts architectural movement]] in the early twentieth century. Known for demanding classwork and setting the [[Beaux-Arts architecture#Beaux-Arts training|highest standards for education]], the École attracted students from around the world—including the United States, where students returned to design buildings that would influence the history of architecture in America, including the [[Boston Public Library]], 1888–1895 ([[McKim, Mead &amp; White]]) and the [[New York Public Library]], 1897–1911 ([[Carrère and Hastings]]). Architectural graduates, especially in France, are granted the title ''élève''.

The architecture department was separated from the École after the May 1968 student strikes at the [[Sorbonne]]. The name was changed to [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]]. Today, over 500 students make use of an extensive collection of classical art coupled with modern additions to the curriculum, including photography and hypermedia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ensba.fr/exl-php/cadcgp.php?QUERY=1&amp;VUE=ensba_catalogue&amp;MODELE=vues/ensba_catalogue/home.html Online catalogue].
