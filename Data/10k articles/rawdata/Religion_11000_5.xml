'''Adolphe Schloss''' (10 August 1842 – 31 December 1910) was a French art collector.

Schloss was born to a [[Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/dealer-blasts-french-art-plunder-case-article-1.849145 New York Daily News: "DEALER BLASTS FRENCH IN ART PLUNDER CASE" by Mike Claffey] September 26, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Furth, Lower Bavaria]]. He married Mathilde Lucie Haas and together they collected 333 works from the Northern and Southern Netherlands that became notable as a collection between World War I and World War II. They held a gallery at salon Adolphe Schloss residence 38, avenue Henri Martin, [[Paris]]. After Adolphe's death there, his collection became the property of his wife Lucie, who died in 1938 and the collection was left to their children Marguerite, Henry, Juliette and Lucien. They moved the collection to Chambon for safekeeping during the war, where it was looted by the Vichy government in 1943. Of the 333 objects, only 230 were actually offered to the Hitler museum and 49 were saved for France and given to the [[Louvre museum|Louvre]]. After the war all were lost, but gradually 148 objects could be rediscovered.

Mindell subsequently entered analysis with Riklin and [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] and trained as a Jungian analyst at the Jung Institute.&lt;ref name=Henderson2005 /&gt; He has a Ph.D. in psychology from the [[Union Institute &amp; University|Union Institute]].&lt;ref name=Henderson2005 /&gt;

In the late 1980s Mindell and his wife, Amy Mindell, moved back to the United States from Switzerland, causing some controversy in the small coastal town of [[Yachats, Oregon]], with plans to build a seminar venue.&lt;ref name="Bacon 1990"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bacon |first=Larry |title=Yachats leery about Jungian psychologist’s plans |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=4pF9x-cDGsoC&amp;dat=19900303&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en |accessdate=November 17, 2013 |newspaper=The Register-Guard, Eugene, OR |date=March 3, 1990 |pages=1, 4A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, Mindell and colleagues established a center for teaching process oriented psychology in [[Portland, Oregon]], now known as the Process Work Institute, which in 2001 was the subject of a controversial ethics complaint.&lt;ref name=Schafer&gt;{{cite news |last=Shafer |first=David |title=Dream Academy: and you thought your degree was useless |url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-285-dream_academy.html |accessdate=November 17, 2013 |newspaper=Willamette Week |date=August 29, 2001 |pages=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mindells settled in Oregon, and in 2013 were invited by the Yachats Academy of Arts and Sciences to present a lecture on their conflict resolution and open forum work around the world.&lt;ref name=Lincoln2013&gt;{{cite news |title=Conflict Resolution and Open Forum Experience around the World |url=http://www.newslincolncounty.com/archives/90324 |accessdate=May 29, 2014 |newspaper=News Lincoln County |date=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Overview===
Mindell founded and developed [[process oriented psychology]], also known as Process Work.  Core ideas include his ‘dreambody’ concept and the application of psychology to social issues and conflict resolution in large groups, known as ‘worldwork’ and the principle of ‘deep democracy.’&lt;ref name=Totton2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=VanNuys2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Prengle&gt;{{cite web |last=Prengle |first=Serge |title=Arny Mindell (March, 2009) |url=http://somaticperspectives.com/2009/03/mindell/ |publisher=Somatic Perspectives on Psychotherapy |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mindell’s first book, ''Dreambody: The Body's Role in Revealing the Self'' (1982), linked ‘the mind’s dreaming process with illness and physical symptoms as well as with disciplines such as yoga and tai chi.’&lt;ref name="Nees2015" /&gt;{{rp|17}} Mindell is known for suggesting that ‘symptoms are dreams trying to come true.’&lt;ref name="Maisel"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maisel |first1=Eric R. |title=Gregg Levoy on Meaningful Work (March 12, 2016) |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/rethinking-mental-health/201603/gregg-levoy-meaningful-work |website=Psychology Today |accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanislav Grof]] has described Arnold Mindell as one of the ‘pioneers of transpersonal psychology.’&lt;ref name=Grof2010&gt;Grof, S. (2010). The Consciousness Revolution. In V. V. Kozlov, V. V. Maykov, &amp; V. F. Petrenko (Eds.), ''Consciousness Revolution: Transpersonal Discoveries That Are Changing the World. Materials of the 17th International Transpersonal Conference''. Moscow, July 23–27, 2010. (pp. 100–103). Moscow: Presidium of the International Academy of Psychological Sciences. Retrieved from http://ita2010.com/downloads/en/eng_17th_Conference_Theses.pdf (p.102)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|102}} In 2012, Mindell was one of five people recognized with a Pioneer Award from the US Association of Body Psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=USABP Pioneer Award 2012 |url=http://usabp.org/about-us/usabp-pioneer-awards/usabp-pioneer-award/ |publisher=United States Association for Body Psychotherapy |accessdate=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a holder of the World Certificate for Psychotherapy (WCPC) awarded by the [[World Council for Psychotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Certificate for Psychotherapy |url=http://www.worldpsyche.org/cms-tag/121/world-certificate-for-psychotherapy-wcpc- |publisher=World Council for Psychotherapy |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2017 critical exploration of the relationship between African Americans and C.G. Jung’s analytical psychology, Fanny Brewster describes Mindell’s dreambody work and his linking of body symptoms and psychological development.&lt;ref name="Brewster2017"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brewster|first1=Fanny|title=African Americans and Jungian Psychology: Leaving the Shadows|date=2017|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1138952768}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|59–61}} Brewster finds that Mindell’s development of Jungian ideas are aligned with traditional African concepts of healing which link mind and body: 
: ‘I believe that Mindell’s approach to dreamwork with its emphasis on body healing mirrors the African system of healing’s inclusiveness of body and mind in the process.’&lt;ref name="Brewster2017"/&gt;{{rp|59}}

Mindell has been described as ‘a natural interculturalist who excels at building relationships across cultural boundaries.’&lt;ref name="Nees2015" /&gt;{{rp|18}} Mindell’s intercultural skills include a focus on the importance of nonverbal elements of communication and the ‘ability to switch viewpoints and join the other’s reality.’&lt;ref name="Nees2015" /&gt;{{rp|19–21}}

Mindell has been the subject of two [[Thinking Allowed (PBS)|Thinking Allowed]] programs, the independent television series hosted by Jeffrey Mishlove.&lt;ref name=Mishlove&gt;{{cite web |title=Program page: Process Psychology and Your Dream Body &amp; Working With Comas |url=http://www.thinkingallowed.com/2amindell.html |work=Thinking Allowed hosted by Jeffrey Mishlove |publisher=Thinking Allowed TV Series and DVD Collection |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has been interviewed on Shrink Rap Radio (2008),&lt;ref name=VanNuys2008 /&gt; New Dimensions Radio (2009, 1995)&lt;ref name=Toms2009&gt;{{cite web |last=Toms |first=Michael |title=Seeing the World the Way It Is: Interview with Arny Mindell, Ph.D. &amp; Amy Mindell, Ph.D.  New Dimensions Radio |url=http://www.newdimensions.org/program-archive/seeing-the-world-the-way-it-is-with-arny-mindell-ph-d-amy-mindell-ph-d/ |work=2009 (Program No. C0138) |publisher=New Dimensions Radio |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Toms1995&gt;{{cite web |last=Toms |first=Michael |title=Worldwork: Ways to Personal and Global Wholeness with Amy Mindell, Ph.D. &amp; Arnold Mindell, Ph.D. |url=http://www.newdimensions.org/program-archive/worldwork-ways-to-personal-and-global-wholeness-with-amy-mindell-ph-d-arnold-mindell-ph-d/#sthash.PWq5vLO5.dpuf |work=1995 (Program No. 2516) |publisher=New Dimensions Radio |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Somatic Perspectives on Psychotherapy (2009).&lt;ref name=Prengle /&gt;

Mindell has been criticised for teaching [[New Age]] concepts and practices that are unclear and unknown within the mainstream of psychology; and it is noted that he is not licensed as a clinical psychologist in Oregon.&lt;ref name="Schafer" /&gt;  Mindell’s dreambody work has been criticized as a form of 'metaphysical healthcare';&lt;ref name="Raso 1998"&gt;{{cite book |last=Raso |first=Jack |title=The Expanded Dictionary of Metaphysical Healthcare, Alternative Medicine, Paranormal Healing, and Related Methods |year=1998 |url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/dictionary/md00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another commentator referred to process oriented psychology as an example of a transpersonal psychology with the potential, he claimed, to be misused as a form of 'mind control.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tomabechi |first=Hideto |title=An interview: A brain-functionalist who deprogrammed AUM's top leaders A Devastating Scenario: A Mind Control Society |url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/y.shimazu/epilogueDrT.html |work=Takarajima, No. 304, March 1997. Pp. 224-271 |accessdate=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key ideas===
The ‘dreambody’ concept was developed in the 1970s while Mindell was a practicing Jungian analyst, derived from his observation of connections between people’s dreams and their body symptoms and published in ''Dreambody: the Body's Role in Revealing the Self'' (Routledge, 1982).&lt;ref name=Singer1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schuit1996 /&gt; Mindell’s therapeutic technique has been compared to [[Fritz Perls]]: “The most striking difference, at least from Perls himself, is one of mood – Mindell's work is playful, supportive and permissive rather than confrontational.”&lt;ref name=Totton2003 /&gt; {{rp|28}} Another commentator writes: “Mindell … exemplifies both the good and bad of contemporary dreamwork. On the first score: there is a bit of flim-flam about Mindell. And he conspicuously overemploys the first person singular while extolling non-ego functions. Also, he interprets disease processes so positively that they begin to lose their catagogic authenticity. But on the second score: he is inventive, creative, intuitive, holistic, and affirmative. He breaks down prevailing categories and finds authentic meanings where our culture traditionally does not. And he helps people.”&lt;ref name=Shafton1995 /&gt;{{rp|522}}

In 1995 Mindell extended the dreambody concept to a theory and practice of working with people in coma and near death states;&lt;ref name=Singer1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schuit1996 /&gt; this work inspired a UK theatre production by [[Improbable theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, L. (May 4, 1999). Arts: Beautiful dreamers: It’s hard to imagine a less promising subject for a play than a coma. But if anyone can make it work, it's Improbable Theatre. ''The Guardian'', p. News: p13.

London.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1988 book, ''City Shadows: Psychological Interventions in Psychiatry,'' Mindell presented his approach to psychiatric disorders, drug addiction and mental retardation.

'''Arthur Green''' ({{lang-he-n|גרין אברהם יצחק}}, born March 21, 1941)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hitzei Yehonatan: Vayakhele-Pekudei (Supplement) Art Green - A Birthday Tribute|url=http://hitzeiyehonatan.blogspot.com/2009/03/vayakhele-pekudei-supplement-art-green.html|website=hitzeiyehonatan.blogspot.com|accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[List of Jewish mysticism scholars|scholar]] of [[Jewish mysticism]] and [[Neo-Hasidism|Neo-Hasidic]] [[Jewish theology|theologian]]. He was a founding dean of the non-denominational rabbinical program at [[Hebrew College]] in [[Boston]], where he still teaches. He describes himself as an American Jew who was educated entirely by the generation of immigrant Jewish intellectuals cast up on American shores by [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Tirosh-Samuelson, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Arthur (Art) Green grew up in [[Newark, New Jersey]] in a nonobservant Jewish home and attended [[Camp Ramah]]. He describes his father as a "militant atheist," but his mother, from a traditional family, felt obligated to give her son a Jewish education.&lt;ref&gt;Tirosh-Samuelson, p. 191–2&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent to a liberal Hebrew School in the congregation of Rabbi [[Joachim Prinz]]. Later he attended the synagogue of Max Gruenewald in [[Millburn, New Jersey]]. At Camp Ramah, his introductory [[Talmud]] teacher was Professor [[David Weiss-Halivni]].

==Academic and rabbinic career==
In 1957, he began his studies at [[Brandeis University]], where he went through a crisis of faith and sought new approaches to Judaism. It is there that he encountered mystical Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Mayse, p. 3-5&lt;/ref&gt; Green's professors at Brandeis included [[Nahum Glatzer]] and [[Alexander Altmann]]. During his college years, he also met Rabbi [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]], who became a lifelong friend and mentor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arthur|last=Green|chapter=Renewal and Havurah: American Movements, European Roots|editor1-last=Fishbane|editor1-first=Eitan P.|editor2-last=Sarna|editor2-first=Jonathan D.|title=Jewish renaissance and revival in America: essays in memory of Leah Levitz Fishbane|series=Brandeis series in American Jewish history, culture, and life|date=2011|pages=151-152|publisher=Brandeis University Press|location=Waltham, Massachusetts|isbn=9781611681925|url=https://bir.brandeis.edu/bitstream/handle/10192/30692/Fishbane.pdf?sequence=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After college, Green trained for the rabbinate at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], where he studied privately with [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayse, p. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Green returned to Brandeis in 1967, earning his doctorate with Professor Altman. His dissertation became his book ''Tormented Master: The Life and Spiritual Quest of Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav''.

In 1968, Green founded [[Havurat Shalom]], an experiment in Jewish communal life and learning that became the fountainhead of the [[Havurah]] movement in American Jewish life.

Between 1973-1984, Green taught in the Religious Studies Department of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayse, p. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 he became dean, and then president, of the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Presidents|url=http://www.rrc.edu/about/college-leadership/past-presidents|website=RRC|accessdate=July 4, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, he was appointed Philip W. Lown professor of Jewish Thought at Brandeis, inheriting a chair that had been created for his mentor Professor Altmann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Class of 1961|url=http://www.brandeis.edu/magazine/2015/spring/class-notes/1961.html|website=Brandeis Magazine|accessdate=July 4, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 he was invited to create a new non-denominational Rabbinical School at Hebrew College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rabbi Arthur Green faculty biography {{!}} Rabbnical School of Hebrew Collegewww.hebrewcollege.edu|url=http://www.hebrewcollege.edu/arthur-green|website=www.hebrewcollege.edu|accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green has published both academic works on the intellectual history of Jewish mysticism and [[Hasidism]], as well as writings of a more personal theological sort. ''Radical Judaism'', said to be his most important theological work,&lt;ref&gt;Mayse, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; was published by [[Yale University Press]] in 2010, based on a series of lectures he delivered at [[Yale University]] in the Fall of 2006.

Green is also known as a translator and commentator of Hasidic sources&lt;ref&gt;Mayse, p. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; and is a key figure in the articulation of a Neo-Hasidic approach to Judaism. His two edited volumes (together with A. E. Mayse) ''A New Hasidism: Roots and Branches'', is to appear in 2018, published by the [[Jewish Publication Society]].

Green’s works have been translated into seven languages, including Hebrew.  The Hebrew version of Tormented Master (''Ba’al ha-Yissurim''—בעל היסורים)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=בעל היסורים|url=http://www.am-oved.co.il/page_636|website=www.am-oved.co.il|accessdate=July 4, 2017|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an influential best-seller in Israel,&lt;ref&gt;Mayse, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; where Green visits and lectures frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Mayse, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  An expanded Hebrew version of Radical Judaism (יהדות רדיקלית: פתיחת שער למבקשי דרך)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=יהדות רדיקלית - אברהם יצחק גרין {{!}} ידיעות ספרים שאוהבים|url=http://www.ybook.co.il/book/6819/%D7%99%D7%94%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%AA|website=www.ybook.co.il|accessdate=July 4, 2017|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in 2016.

The '''Badami cave temples''' are a complex of four [[Hinduism|Hindu]], a [[Jainism|Jain]] and possibly [[Buddhist]] cave temples located in [[Badami]], a town in the [[Bagalkot district]] in northern part of [[Karnataka]], India. The caves are considered an example of [[Indian rock-cut architecture]], especially [[Badami Chalukya architecture]], which dates from the 6th century. Badami was previously known as Vataapi Badami, the capital of the early [[Chalukya dynasty]], which ruled much of Karnataka from the 6th to the 8th century. Badami is situated on the west bank of a man made lake ringed by an earthen wall with stone steps; it is surrounded on the north and south by forts built in later times.

The Badami cave temples represent some of the earliest known examples of [[Hindu temple]]s in the Deccan region. They along with the temples in [[Aihole]] transformed the Malaprabha River valley into a cradle of temple architecture that influenced the components of later Hindu temples elsewhere in India.

Caves 1 to 4 are in the escarpment of the hill in soft Badami [[sandstone]] formation, to the south-east of the town. In Cave 1, among various sculptures of Hindu divinities and themes, a prominent carving is of the [[Tandava]]-dancing [[Shiva]] as [[Nataraja]]. Cave 2 is mostly similar to Cave 1 in terms of its layout and dimensions, featuring Hindu subjects of which the [[relief]] of [[Vishnu]] as [[Trivikrama]] is the largest. The largest cave is Cave 3, featuring Vishnu-related mythology, and it is also the most intricately carved cave in the complex. Cave 4 is dedicated to revered figures of Jainism. Around the lake, Badami has additional caves of which one may be a Buddhist cave. Another cave was discovered in 2015, about {{Convert|500|m}} from the four main caves, with 27 Hindu carvings.

== Geography ==

The Badami cave temples are located in the town of [[Badami]] in the north-central part of [[Karnataka]], India. The temples are about {{convert|88|mi}} east of [[Belgavi]] (IATA Code: IXT), and {{convert|87|mi}} northwest of [[Hampi]]. The [[Malaprabha river|Malaprabha River]] is {{convert|3|mi}} away. The cave temples are {{convert|14|mi}} from the UNESCO world heritage site [[Pattadakal]] and {{convert|22|mi}} from [[Aihole]] – another site with over a hundred ancient and early medieval era Hindu, Jain and Buddhist monuments.{{Sfn|Michell|2017|pp=12-17, 78, 108}}

[[File:6th - 7th century Badami cave temples layout exterior annotated.jpg|left|thumb|Caves on the cliff above Agastya Lake]]

== Temple caves ==

The Badami cave temples are carved out of soft Badami [[sandstone]] on a hill cliff.{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=38–50}} The plan of each of the four caves (1 to 4) includes an entrance with a verandah (''mukha mandapa'') supported by stone columns and [[bracket (architecture)|brackets]], a distinctive feature of these caves, leading to a columned [[mandapa]], or main hall (also ''maha mandapa''), and then to the small, square shrine ([[sanctum sanctorum]], ''garbha ghriya'') cut deep inside the cave.{{Sfn|Thapar|2012|p=45}} The cave temples are linked by a stepped path with intermediate terraces overlooking the town and lake. The cave temples are labelled 1–4 in their ascending series; this numbering does not reflect the sequence of excavation.{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=37}}

The architecture includes structures built in the [[Nagara architecture|Nagara]] and [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian styles]], which is the first and most persistent architectural idiom to be adopted by the [[chalukyas|early chalukyas]].{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=37}}

=== Cave 1 ===

[[File:Badami.JPG|thumb|Entrance to Cave{{nbsp}}1]]
[[File:Temple troglodytique dédié à Shiva (Badami, Inde) (14146091479).jpg|thumb|[[Nataraja]] or Dancing Shiva in Cave{{nbsp}}1]]

Cave 1 is about {{Convert|59|ft}} above ground level on the north-west part of the hill. Access is through a series of steps that depict carvings of dwarfish [[gana]]s in different postures as if they hold the cave floor.{{Sfn|Fergusson|1880|p=413}} The verandah, with an inner measurement of {{Convert|70|ft}} by {{Convert|65| ft}}, has five columns sculpted with reliefs of flower garlands, foliage and jewelry.{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=37–38}}{{Sfn|Michell|2017|pp=46-47}}

The cave portrays the [[Tandava]]-dancing Shiva as [[Nataraja]] on the rock face to the right of entrance.{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=37–38}}{{Sfn|Fergusson|1880|p=414}}&lt;ref name=aliceboner /&gt; The image, {{Convert|5|ft}} tall, has 18 arms in a form that expresses the dance positions arranged in a geometric pattern, which [[Alice Boner]]{{snds}}a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] art historian and [[Indologist]], states is a time division symbolizing the cosmic wheel.&lt;ref name=aliceboner /&gt; The eighteen arms express Natya [[mudra]]s (symbolic hand gestures),&lt;ref&gt;Fred Kleiner (2009), Gardner's Art through the Ages: Non-Western Perspectives, Wadsworth Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-495-57367-8}}, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; with some holding objects such as drums, a flame torch, a serpent, a trident and an axe.{{Sfn|Michell|2017|pp=46-47}} Shiva has his son [[Ganesha]] and the bull [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] by his side. Adjoining the Nataraja, the wall depicts the goddess [[Durga]] of [[Shaktism]] tradition slaying the buffalo-demon [[Mahishasura]].{{Sfn|Michell|2017|pp=46-47}}

On the left of the entrance is a two handed Shaiva [[dvarapala]] who holds a trident, and below him is a bull-elephant fused image where they share a head; seen from left it is an elephant and from right a bull.{{Sfn|Michell|2017|pp=46-47}} Once inside the veranda, the cave presents a carved sculpture of [[Harihara]], a {{Convert|7.75|ft|adj=on}} high sculpture of a fused image that is half-Shiva and half-[[Vishnu]]. He is flanked on respective sides with the goddesses [[Parvati]] and [[Lakshmi]].{{Sfn|Fergusson|1880|p=414}}{{Sfn|Michell|2017|pp=46-47}} To the right, toward the end of the wall, is a relief sculpture of [[Ardhanarishvara]], a fused image of Shiva and his consort Parvati. Next to the half that represents Parvati is an attendant carrying a tray of jewels. Next to the Ardhanarishvara half that represents Shiva is Nandi the bull, and skeletal [[Bhringi]], a devotee of Shiva.{{Sfn|Fergusson|1880|pp=414-415}}{{Sfn|Michell|2017|pp=46-47}}

Inside this cave, the sons of Shiva, Ganesha and [[Kartikeya]], the god of war and family deity of the Chalukya dynasty, are seen in one of the carved sculptures on the walls of the cave, with Kartikeya riding a peacock.{{Sfn|Fergusson|1880|p=413}}{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=37–38}} The roof of the cave has five carved panels with the central panel depicting the [[Nagaraja]], with flying couples on both sides.{{Sfn|Michell|2017|pp=46-47}} The head and bust are well formed and project from the centre of the coil. In another compartment a bas-relief {{Convert|2.5|ft}} in diameter has carvings of a male and female; the male is [[Yaksha]] carrying a sword and the female is [[Apsara]] with a flying veil. The succeeding panel has carvings of two small figures and the panel at the end is carved with lotuses.{{Sfn|Fergusson|1880|p=416}}

All the figures are adorned with carved ornaments and surrounded by borders with reliefs of animals and birds. The lotus design is a common theme. On the ceiling are images of the [[Vidyadhara]] couples as well as couples in courtship and erotic [[Mithuna]] scenes. Through a cleft in the back wall of the cave is a square sanctuary with more carved images. In the mandapa is a seated Nandi facing the ''garbha ghriya'' (sacrum sanctum) containing a Shiva linga.{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=37–38}}{{Sfn|Michell|2017|pp=46-47}}

=== Cave 2 ===

Right:  [[Trivikrama]] stepping Vishnu, [[Vamana]] avatar legend and ancient Indian musical instruments carved below.}}

Cave 2 is above and to the east of Cave{{nbsp}}1 and faces north. It was created in late 6th or early 7th century. It is smaller than Cave{{nbsp}} 1, somewhat similar in terms of its floor plan, but it is dedicated primarily to Vishnu.{{sfn|Michell|2017|pp=44-48}} Cave{{nbsp}}2 is reached by climbing 64 steps from the first cave. The cave entrance is a verandah divided by four square pillars with ends as half pillars, all carved out of the monolithic stone face. The pillars have decorative carvings with frieze of ''ganas'' (mythical dwarfs) with various facial expressions. On the two sides of the entrance are standing ''dvarapalas'' (guardians) holding flowers, not weapons.{{sfn|Michell|2017|pp=44-48}}{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=38–50}} Like Cave{{nbsp}}1, Cave 2 art reflects Hindu theology and arts.{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=38–50}}{{sfn|Michell|2017|pp=44-48}}&lt;ref&gt;Gary Tarr (1970), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4629258 Chronology and Development of the Chāḷukya Cave Temples], Ars Orientalis, The Smithsonian Institution and Department of the History of Art, University of Michigan, Vol. 8, pp. 155-184&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest relief in Cave 2 depicts the legend of Vishnu in his [[Trivikrama]] form, taking one of the [[Vishnu#Trivikrama: the three steps of Vishnu|three steps]]. Below the raised step is a frieze showing the legend of [[Vamana]] dwarf avatar of Vishnu, before he morphs into the Trivikrama form.{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=38–50}} Another major relief shows the legend of Vishnu in his [[Varaha]] (a boar) avatar rescuing goddess earth ([[Bhudevi]]) from the depths of cosmic ocean, with a penitent multi-headed snake (''[[Nāga]]'') below.{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=38–50}}{{sfn|Michell|2017|pp=47-48}} Like other major ''[[murti]]'' (statue) in this and other Badami caves, the Varaha artwork is set in a circle and symmetrically laid out; according to Alice Boner, the panel is an upright rectangle whose "height is equal to the octopartite directing circle and sides are aligned to essential geometric ratios, in this case to the second vertical chord of the circle".&lt;ref name=aliceboner /&gt; The walls and ceiling have traces of colored paint, suggesting the cave used to have fresco paintings.{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=38–50}}

Inside the temple are friezes showing stories from Hindu texts such as the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]''.&lt;ref name=aliceboner /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archana Verma (2012), Temple Imagery from Early Mediaeval Peninsular India, Ashgate, {{ISBN|978-1-4094-3029-2}}, pages&amp;nbsp;89–93&lt;/ref&gt; These show the legend of cosmic ocean churning (''[[Samudra manthan|Samudra Manthan]]'') and Krishna's birth and flute playing indicating the theological and cultural significance of these in 7th century India. The ceiling and door head carvings show [[Gajalakshmi]], the [[swastika]] symbols, flying couples, Brahma, Vishnu asleep on Shesha and others.{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=38–50}}{{sfn|Michell|2017|pp=44-48}}&lt;ref name="Boner1990p89"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alice Boner|title=Principles of Composition in Hindu Sculpture: Cave Temple Period |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doQLZ21CGScC |year=1990| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0705-1| pages=89–95, 120–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceiling of Cave 2 shows a wheel with sixteen fish spokes in a square frame. The end bays have a flying couple and Vishnu on [[Garuda]].{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=38–50}} The main hall in the cave is {{Convert|33.33|ft}} wide, {{Convert|23.583|ft}} deep, and {{Convert|11.33| ft}} high and is supported by eight square pillars in two rows. The roof of this hall has panels filled with bas-relief carvings.{{Sfn|Fergusson|1880|p=412}} The sculptures of Cave 2, like Cave 1,  are of the northern Deccan style of the 6th and 7th century similar to that found in [[Ellora caves]].&lt;ref name=jcharle&gt;JC Harle (1972), Aspects of Indian Art, BRILL Academic, {{ISBN|978-90-04-03625-3}}, page 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Cave 3 is earliest dated [[Hindu temple]] in the Deccan region. It is dedicated to Vishnu; it is the largest cave in the complex. It has intricately carved friezes and giant figures of Trivikrama, Anantasayana, Vasudeva, Varaha, [[Harihara]] and [[Narasimha]].{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=38–50}} Cave{{nbsp}}3's primary theme is [[Vaishnavite]], though it also shows Harihara on its southern wall{{snds}}&lt;ref&gt;VK Subramanian (2003), Art Shrines of Ancient India, Abhinav, {{ISBN|978-81-7017-431-8}}, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; half Vishnu and half Shiva shown fused as one, making the cave important to [[Shaivism]] studies.{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=50}}&lt;ref&gt;TA Gopinatha Rao (1993), Elements of Hindu iconography, Vol 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0877-5}}, pages&amp;nbsp;334–335&lt;/ref&gt;

Facing north, Cave 3 is 60 steps from Cave{{nbsp}}2 at a higher level. Cave{{nbsp}}3's verandah is {{Convert|70|ft}} in length with an interior width of {{Convert|65|ft}}; it has been sculpted {{Convert|48|ft}} deep into the mountain; an added square shrine at the end extends the cave {{Convert|12|ft}} further inside.{{Sfn|Fergusson|1880|p=406}} The verandah itself is {{Convert|7|ft}} wide and has four free-standing, carved pillars separating it from the hall. The cave is {{Convert|15|ft}} high; it is supported by six pillars, each measuring {{Convert|2.5|sqft}}.{{Sfn|Fergusson|1880|pp=406–407}} Each column and pilaster is carved with wide, deep bases crowned with capitals that are partly hidden by brackets on three sides. Each bracket, except for one, has carvings of human figures standing under foliage in different postures, of male and female mythological characters, and an attendant figure of a dwarf. A moulded cornice in the facia, with a [[Dado (architecture)|dado]] of blocks below it (generally {{Convert|7|ft}} long), has about thirty compartments carved with two dwarves called ''[[ganas]]''.{{Sfn|Fergusson|1880|pp=406–407}}

Cave 3 also shows fresco paintings on the ceiling, some of which are faded and broken. These are among the earliest known surviving evidence of fresco painting in Indian art.&lt;ref name=stellakramrischpaint&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1936), Paintings at Badami, Journal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art, Vol 4, Number 1, pages&amp;nbsp;57–61&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu god Brahma is seen on [[Hamsa (bird)|Hamsa]] vahana in one of the murals.

There is a lotus medallion on the floor underneath the ceiling mural of Brahma. The ceiling has reliefs of many Vedic gods and goddesses such as Agni, Indra and Varuna.{{sfn|Michell|2017|pp=48-50}} The cave artworks, in some cases, show the artists signatures, as well as a major inscription. This and other epigraphical evidence suggests that the cave temple was inaugurated on the "full moon day, 1 November 578".{{sfn|Michell|2017|p=53}} The roof of the verandah has seven panels created by cross beams; each is painted in circular compartments with images of deities including Shiva, Vishnu, [[Indra]], Brahma and [[Kamadeva|Kama]], with smaller images of [[Guardians of the directions|Dikpalas]] (cardinal guardians) at the corners.{{Sfn|Fergusson|1880|p=411}}

[[File:6th century Vishnu lifting a collapsing woman on pillar top looking below in Cave 3, Badami Hindu cave temple Karnataka 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Artwork shows a collapsing sorrowful woman being helped.]]
The roof of the front aisle has panels with murals in the centre of male and female figurines flying in the clouds; the male figure is [[yaksha]] holding a sword and a shield. Decoration of lotus blooms are also seen on the panels. The roof of the hall is divided into nine panels slightly above the level of the ceiling. The central panel here depicts a [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] mounted on a ram{{snds}}conjectured to be [[Agni]]. Images of Brahma and [[Varuna]] are also painted on the central panels; the floating figures are seen in the remaining panels.{{Sfn|Fergusson|1880|p=412}}

The sculpture in Cave 3 is well preserved. Vishnu is presented in various avatars and forms, such as a standing Vishnu with eight arms; Vishnu seated on the hooded serpent Shesha on the eastern side of the veranda; Vishnu as standing Narasimha (man-lion avatar); Vishnu as Varaha (man-boar avatar) rescuing earth; Harihara (half Shiva, half Vishnu and their equivalence); and Trivikrama-Vamana avatars.&lt;ref name=aliceboner /&gt;{{sfn|Michell|2017|pp=48-50}} The back wall has carvings of [[Vidyadhara|Vidhyadharas]].

To the back of this verandah is a hall with two standalone and two joined pillars. The first aisle is a verandah {{Convert|31| ft}} long by {{Convert|6.5| ft}} wide, extending to {{Convert|16|ft}} deep. From the hall, steps lead to the [[sanctum sanctorum]], which is {{Convert|25.5| ft}} wide extends to a depth of {{Convert|6|ft}}.{{Sfn|Fergusson|1880|p=491}}

Inside the cave are major carvings of [[Bahubali]], [[Parshvanatha]] and [[Mahavira]] with symbolic display of other Tirthankaras. Bahubali is standing in [[Kayotsarga]] meditating posture with vines wrapped around his leg, his classic iconography. Parshvanatha is shown with the five-headed cobra hood.{{Sfn|Michell|2017|pp=53-54}} Mahavira is represented sitting on a lion throne,{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=60}}{{Sfn|Fergusson|1880|p=491}} whose identifying markers are not visibly and is identified by some scholars simply as a "seated Jina".{{Sfn|Michell|2017|pp=53-54}} This figure is flanked by bas-reliefs of attendants with ''chauri'' (fans), ''sardulas'' and [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]]'s heads. Other carvings include [[Indrabhuti Gautama]] covered by four snakes, Brahmi and Sundari.{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=60-61}}{{Sfn|Fergusson|1880|p=491}} In the sanctum is an image of Mahavira resting on a pedestal containing a 12th-century Kannada inscription marking the death of one Jakkave. Twenty four small Jaina [[Tirthankara]] images are engraved on the inner pillars and walls. In addition there are idols of [[Yaksha]]s, [[Yakshi]]s and [[Padmavati (Jainism)|Padmavati]].{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=60-61}}

The face of this statue is damaged and missing its face.&lt;ref name=bvshetti&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shetti|first=BV|url=http://www.jainlibrary.org/elib_master/article/250000_article_english/Image_of_Buddhavatara_of_Visnu_at_Badami_269008_std.pdf|format=PDF|title= An image of Buddhavatara of Visnu at Badami|journal= Nirgrantha|volume= 1|number= 2|year=1995| pages=87–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cave5 /&gt;

There are several theories as to who the statue represents. One theory holds that it is a relief of the Buddha in a sitting posture.&lt;ref name=cave5 /&gt; According to this theory, those holding the ''chauris'' are [[Bodhisattvas]] flanking the Buddha. According to George Michell, the halo, the Pipal tree and cloak-like dress suggests that this was originally a Buddha statue.{{sfn|Michell|2017|p=61}} The shrine, states this theory, was converted to Hindu worship in recent times.&lt;ref name=cave5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/india/badami/bucave02.html|title= Small Buddhist Cave:Badami, Image 2|accessdate=22 October 2015|publisher=art-and-archaeology.com, Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aaacave5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/india/badami/bucave01.html|title= Small Buddhist Cave:Badami|accessdate=21 October 2015|publisher=art-and-archaeology.com, Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to B.V.

This theory is supported by the [[Sudarshana Chakra|chakra]], [[Shankha|conch]] and jewelry included in its iconography. The style suggests it was likely carved in or before the 8th{{nbsp}}century.&lt;ref name=bvshetti /&gt;

Another theory found in colonial-era texts such as one by John Murray{{snds}}a missionary in [[British India]] and Jainism scholar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Numark | first=Mitch | title=The Scottish `Discovery' of Jainism in Nineteenth-Century Bombay | journal=Journal of Scottish Historical Studies | publisher=Edinburgh University Press | volume=33 | issue=1 | year=2013 | pages=20–51 | doi=10.3366/jshs.2013.0061 | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; states the main image carved in Cave{{nbsp}}5 is that of a Jaina figure.&lt;ref&gt;John Murray (1897), {{Google books|Tr8XAAAAYAAJ|A Handbook for Travellers in India, Ceylon and Burma|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a third theory, by Henry Cousens and A.{{nbsp}}Sundara{{snds}}archaeologists, and supported by local legends, the statue is of an ancient king; in a photograph of the statue taken before its face was damaged, the figure lacked the [[Ushnisha]] lump that typically goes with Buddha's image.&lt;ref name=bvshetti /&gt; The statue has several unusual, non-Buddha ornaments such as rings for fingers, a necklace and a chest-band; it wears a Hindu [[Yajnopavita]] thread and its head is stylistically closer to a [[Arihant (Jainism)|Jina]] head than a Buddha head.&lt;ref name=bvshetti /&gt; These features suggest the statue may be of a king represented with features of various traditions.&lt;ref name=bvshetti /&gt; According to Carol Radcliffe Bolon{{snds}}Assistant Curator at the Smithsonian Freer Gallery of Art, the date and identity of the main statue in Cave{{nbsp}}5 remains enigmatic.&lt;ref&gt;Carol E Radcliffe (1981), Early Chalukya sculpture, PhD Thesis awarded by New York University, {{oclc|7223956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Close to the controversial cave are other monuments. One of them is a small shrine consisting of a 7th-century rock carving of Anantashayana Vishnu, or reclining Vishnu with Lakshmi and Garuda in namaste posture. Vishnu is shown restarting the cosmic cycle by giving birth to all of existence. Above the reclining carved relief are the ten avatars of Vishnu – Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krishna, Buddha and Kalki. Between the Narasimha and Vamana is shown a relief of Brahma cord connected to Vishnu's navel. To the left of the relief is depicted the Trinity – Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma, while to the right is a human couple and a mother cow with a calf feeding.{{sfn|Michell|2017|p=61}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sivanandini Duraiswamy|title=The creative touches of the chisel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7cmfAAAAMAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Vijitha|isbn=978-955-8095-49-2|pages=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Manjunath Sullolli{{snds}}Assistant Director of Bagalkot district working for the state government of Karnataka, reported the discovery of another cave with 27 rock carvings, about {{Convert|500|m}} from the four main caves. Water gushes from this newly discovered cave year round. It depicts Vishnu and other Hindu deities, and features an inscription in the [[Devanagari script]]. The dating of these carvings is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-badami-s-supremacy-set-in-stone-1878155|title=Badami's supremacy set in stone|date=22 August 2013|publisher=DNA India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/Natural-cave-shrine-discovered/2013/06/10/article1628245.ece|title= Natural cave shrine discovered|date=June 2013|newspaper=Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bahá'í Esperanto-League''' ('''BEL''') is the official organization of Bahá'ís who are [[Esperanto|Esperantists]]. It was founded on 19 March 1973 with the approval of the [[Universal House of Justice]].

== The Bahá'í Faith and Esperanto ==

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] advocates the introduction of an international auxiliary language which, together with the mother tongue, would be taught in all the schools of the world (''see [[Bahá'í Faith and auxiliary language]]''). This is one of the prerequisites of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] for the unification of mankind, the establishment of lasting peace and the advancement of human culture.

Thus it is not surprising that the relationship of the Bahá'í community to the Esperanto movement has a long history. [[Esperanto]] was highly praised by [['Abdu'l-Bahá]]. From the time of its introduction until the present time, many Bahá'ís have learned the language and actively supported the [[Esperanto movement]].

[[Bahá'u'lláh]] has left it to the governments of the world to decide upon the question of a common script and to choose the international language from among the existing national tongues or to create a new language specially for this purpose. For this reason Bahá'ís tend to place emphasis on the urgency of introducing such a language rather than giving direct support to Esperanto or to any other one language.

Baha’u’llah himself in the Sixth [[Ishráqát|Ishraq]] calls on the Universal House of Justice to decide the language question: “In former epistles We have enjoined upon Trustees of the House of Justice either to choose one language from among those now existing or to adopt a new one…” And, this institution itself in its letter of 8 June 1980 has expanded: “On the one hand this task is given to the governments of the world, on the other it is given to the House of Justice.” The selection question is probably ergo a process in at least two parts resting with – (1) the supreme governing body of the Baha’is of the world (Haifa) and (2) as stated on the last page of the Kitab-i-Aqdas with the parliaments of the world.

As Bahá’í texts etc. on this vast subject are many and deep and as they refer positively in various places to five tongues        - Arabic, English, Esperanto, Persian and Spanish - one can easily accept why the very next sentence of that 1980 letter explains: “It is not possible now to see how this will come about…” What requires little intellectual discussion is how often and pleadingly ‘Abdu’l-Baha asked ‘every one of us to study Esperanto’ whether or not it becomes universal and how Shoghi Effendi interpreted all that as ‘repeated and emphatic admonitions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’. The whole language question however is similar to what the essence of religion has ever been - a spiritual and mystical matter over and above any intellectual dimension. When this overarching Baha’i principle is systematically and widely consulted on this process will be better understood and disputes re the selection question avoided because whether English will remain dominant or whether Mandarin will become dominant are as ephemeral questions as which national language of the 19th century was dominant. Such puerile disputes will evaporate when the principle of a universal auxiliary language is properly discussed and understood.

== The Bahá'í Esperanto-League ==
{{Esperanto sidebar |expanded=Services}}
In the 1920s and 30s certain notable Bahá'ís such as [[Martha Root]], [[Lidia Zamenhof]] and [[Hermann Grossmann]] &amp;mdash; the founder of the Bahá'í Esperanto magazine ''La Nova Tago'' &amp;mdash; were active in the Esperanto movement. After the Second World War, the office of the Bahá'í International Community in Geneva was able to continue this activity, but only for a few years. In the 1950s and 60s the task was again taken over by individuals such as [[Adelbert Mühlschlegel]] and [[Roan Orloff-Stone]]. As a natural outcome of this, the Bahá'í Esperanto League was founded at the beginning of the 1970s, thus placing the activities of the Bahá'í Esperantists on a broader foundation.

== Founding the Bahá'í Esperanto-League ==

There are signs that the idea of forming a collaboration of Bahá'í Esperantists was beginning to grow even at the beginning of the 1960s, particularly at the time immediately before the [[Esperanto World Congress]] in [[Budapest]] in 1966. Adelbert Mühlschlegel made efforts to bring this about but initially not very much was achieved. It was not until [[Paulo Amorim Cardoso]] accepted the faith in Brazil in 1971 that, with his help and that of Roan Orloff-Stone in the USA, the idea of a collaboration began, with surprising speed, to change into a viable project.

In a letter of July 1971 Cardoso, who at that time was secretary of the [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] of Fortaleza in [[Brazil]], wrote, on behalf of that Assembly, that "it is our intention to create an international Bahá'í Esperanto organisation". With this letter he included a first draft of the constitution of the proposed organisation in which its main aims were defined, namely, the publication of Bahá'í literature in Esperanto, the dissemination of the Bahá'í Faith amongst the Esperantists and the promotion of Esperanto in the Bahá'í Community. He also enclosed with his letter a list (all together 18 names) of Bahá'í Esperantists in Brazil (8), India (1), Spain (1), Iran (1), Portugal (1) and the USA (6). It is very likely that Cardoso's letter was addressed to these 18 people. Also enclosed with his letter was another list, compiled by Roan Orloff-Stone, that contained the names and addresses in 13 different countries of 47 further persons, almost half of them being in the USA. In addition Cardoso began to produce and distribute a newsletter entitled "''Komuna Bahaa Letero''" ("Communal Bahá'í Newsletter"), which later grew into the official BEL Newsletter. It was then during the 57th Esperanto World Congress in Portland, Oregon (USA), that the nine participating Bahá'ís consulted together and decided to write to the Universal House of Justice to seek its approval for the founding of a Bahá'í Esperanto organisation. After consulting with "[[Hand of the Cause of God]]" Adelbert Mühlschlegel, who according to them was "enthusiastic" about this proposal, the Universal House of Justice gave their consent in a letter dated 19 March 1973 (18.19.129 BE), a date which effectively marks the birth of the Bahá'í Esperanto League. In issue No. 5 (April 1973) of "''Komuna Bahaa Letero''" the House of Justice's consent was announced to all the Bahá'í Esperantists who were known to the initiators of the project. Simultaneously, application forms for membership in the League were sent out, together with voting slips for the election of the League's first managing committee.

This election was conducted according to the same principles that are applied when a Local Spiritual Assembly is elected (each member voted for nine persons from the body of all members, without the nomination of any candidates). In a message from the League, dated 30 July 1973, the result of the election, in which a total of 30 members had taken part, was announced: Paulo Amorim Cardoso (Brazil), Roan Orloff-Stone (USA), [[Habib Taherzadeh]] (Israel/Bahá'í World Centre), Adelbert Mühlschlegel (Switzerland), [[Badiollah Samimy]] (Iran), Manuel de Freitas (Portugal), S.C. Gupta (India), Chagzin Kim (Korea), [[Leonora Stirling Armstrong]] (Brazil). The term of office of the governing committee was fixed at three years. In issue No. 9 (November 1973) of the "Komuna Bahaa Letero" it was announced that "BEL now has 73 members in 14 countries: USA 27, Brazil 24, Canada 4, Iran 4, Spain 3, Italy 2, Portugal 2, Argentina 1, Austria 1, Germany 1, Israel 1, Korea 1, The Netherlands 1, Switzerland 1". And in the following issue, No. 10 (January 1974), it was announced: "Here are the names of the first managing committee of our dearly beloved Bahá'í Esperanto League: Chairman: Adelbert Mühlschlegel (Germany), Vice-chairman: Habib Taherzadeh (Israel), Secretary: Paulo Amorim Cardoso (Brazil), Vice-secretary: Roan Orloff-Stone (USA), Treasurer: Manuel de Freitas (Portugal), Vice-treasurer: Leonora Stirling-Armstrong (Brazil)". It was also announced that, in accordance with an earlier decision, all those who had become members up to the time of the election of the first managing committee would automatically be regarded as the founding members of BEL; there were 80 such members in 17 different countries.

== First activities ==

Apart from the task of gaining new members, one of the first activities of the League was the publication of basic Bahá'í information in Esperanto. The League also turned its attention to the question of Bahá'í terminology in Esperanto, for example the names of the 19 months of the Bahá'í Calendar (with issue No. 15 of the "Komuna Bahaa Letero", May 1975, a calendar was enclosed, in which the Bahá'í and Gregorian calendars were placed side by side). The League also applied to the [[World Esperanto Association]] (''Universala Esperanto-Asocio'', UEA) for official recognition of BEL as a "''kunlaboranta faka asocio''" (a cooperating specialised subgroup) of UEA. BEL's application for this status was accepted at the World Esperanto Congress in the following year.

In spite of the successes they had, for the new League the first few years were not easy. Not only were the individual members widely scattered throughout the world, but the members of the managing committee as well. This geographical separation inhibited joint action so that most of the activities were carried out by individuals and were often initiated by the BEL secretary himself. The first secretary was Paulo Amorim Cardoso (Brazil). His work was augmented by Roan Orloff-Stone (USA), who made a significant contribution towards the development of the League and attended all the Esperanto World Congresses between 1976 and 1988. With such a driving force as this, supported by the efforts of a few other dedicated members, the Bahá'í Faith was well represented at each of these Congresses.

In 1976, John T. Dale took over the secretaryship of BEL. Like his predecessor, P.A. Cardoso, he did great deal in moulding the character of the League. He contributed numerous ideas towards the development of BEL and initiated a series of projects, many of which were concerned with the publication of new material. He also took on the task of editing the BEL Newsletter, to which he gave the new name "''BELmonda Letero''". The name may be translated as "BEL World Letter", but the Esperanto pun on the first word ("belmonda" means "beautiful world") is lost in translation.

== Attempts, obstacles and achievements ==

Even after the initial founding years, the League went on being handicapped by the problem of geographical separation; the managing committee itself was unable to make personal acquaintance with the majority of the BEL members. On top of all this, in 1979, contact with the Bahá'í Esperantists in Iran (there had been 16 on the election list of 1976) had to be broken off because, in the wake of the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]], correspondence with the West would have been dangerous for these members.

One of the main tasks to which John Dale, in his capacity as secretary, dedicated himself "was to rectify the widespread misunderstanding on the part of Bahá'ís of the Esperanto language". He found that the many of them favoured English as the future world language; others regarded Esperanto as the ideal candidate for this role but were not willing to learn it before a specific request to do so had come from the Universal House of Justice. "To overcome such misunderstanding of and resistance towards the activities of BEL, I took upon myself the following tasks: (1) to compile quotations from the Bahá'í Writings about Esperanto and the language problem; ... (2) to collect Bahá'í-Esperanto documents and to translate various Bahá'í texts into Esperanto; ... (3) to produce and distribute information material and basic documents in English and Esperanto as an aid towards making BEL better known among both Bahá'ís and Esperantists."

The translation of [[John Esslemont]]'s "[[Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era]]" &amp;mdash; the most widely known introduction to the Bahá'í Faith &amp;mdash; into Esperanto had been initiated by Martha Root and carried to completion by Lidia Zamenhof. The reissuing in 1978 of this translation, "''[[Bahá'u'lláh kaj la Nova Epoko]]''", after revision, additions and the inclusion of an appendix was certainly one of the greatest successes of this period.

Furthermore in 1976, under the editorship of John Dale, BEL published the brochure "''Unueco kaj universala lingvo''" (Unity and Universal Language) in four languages (Portuguese, Spanish, Esperanto and the original English). This was followed in 1977 by the brochure "''Bahaaj Respondoj''" (Bahá'í Answers) and in 1981 by "''La Kaŝitaj Vortoj''" (The Hidden Words), one of the central Writings of Bahá'u'lláh. In 1979 Dale also sent a letter, enclosing a copy of the "''BELmonda Letero''", to all National Spritiual Assemblies in order to make the existence of BEL better known to seek the cooperation of the national Bahá'í communities. Dale also wrote to the Universal House of Justice, requesting it "to consider ways and means of experimentally introducing Esperanto and encouraging the Bahá'ís to learn the language."

A similar request had been made earlier by Cardoso. But again the attempt was in vain. The Universal House of Justice did not change its standpoint: although very much sympathising with the aims of the Bahá'í-Esperanto movement, it was opposed to the unofficial introduction of Esperanto (even if only temporary) into the Bahá'í Community, stressing that it was the principle of an international auxiliary language rather any one concrete proposal that Bahá'ís supported. At that time Cardoso had been so disappointed that all his efforts were bearing no fruit that he left the Faith a few years later.

== New developments following the World Congresses in Beijing and Warsaw ==

During the second half of the 1980s, the centre of activity began to shift away from the Americas to Western Europe, Germany in particular, and it was during this time the League began to prosper. One reason behind this was that amongst the Bahá'ís Esperanto had acquired the reputation of being an "entrance ticket" to countries behind the so-called Iron Curtain, countries to which the Bahá'í Faith had had no access during the preceding decades. In this connection, the Esperanto World Congress in Beijing in 1986, in which about a dozen BEL members from nearly as many different countries took part, and in the following the Centenary Congress in Warsaw in 1987, which was attended by an unprecedented number of Bahá'ís (about 50 from 20 different countries).

In addition to the nucleus of the League, Bahá'í-Esperanto committees or subsidiary groups in Germany, the USA, Great Britain and Switzerland (in 1993 Bulgaria joined them) were set up in the past and in part are still functioning today. Following the "''Internacia Junulara Kongreso''" (IJK, International Youth Congress) in [[Kraków]], Poland, in 1987, the League was even able to found a youth section, known as JuBEL, which for several years afterwards was able to arrange that young Bahá'í Esperantists took part in the annual International Youth Congresses (IJK) and that Bahá'í items were included in the congress programmes.

At the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s BEL was also able to organise a series of several-day seminars on the Faith, the so-called "BELaj Tagoj" (BEL Days or "Beautiful Days"), three of which took place in Poland and one each in Bulgaria and the Slovak Republic. And in 1992, [[Roman Dobrzynski]], a Polish journalist and the then Vice-President of the UEA (Universala Esperanto-Asocio: Universal Esperanto Association), presented, during the Esperanto World Congress in Vienna, the Esperanto version of his film on the Faith and the Bahá'í World Centre in Haifa, Israel, entitled ''Ŝafejo de la Naŭa Profeto'' (Sheepfold of the Ninth Prophet).

Progress was also made in the publication of Bahá'í Esperanto literature; for example the two attractive brochures with colour printing: "''La Vojo al Paco''" (The Way to Peace) and "''La Bahaa Kredo''" (The Bahá'í Religion), as well as the very important publication entitled "''La Promeso de Monda Paco''" ([[The Promise of World Peace]]). In 1989 BEL made a significant contribution towards the publication of the well-known compilation by O.P. Ghai entitled ''Unueco en Diverseco'' (Unity in Diversity). And in 1992 BEL was also able to publish a small selection from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh entitled ''Perloj de l'Saĝo'' (Pearls of Wisdom).

Not long after John T. Dale had tried to develop and more widely distribute the "BELmonda Letero", it shrank to a modest circular letter of 2 to 6 pages. It continues to function as the newsletter for all BEL members and is automatically distributed to them subscription-free. It contains membership information, important addresses, statements from the managing committee, news of activities in different countries and extracts from the Bahá'í Writings. It has become an important instrument of communication within the worldwide BEL community.

== BEL today ==

The membership of BEL increased over the years to more than 400, but an evaluation of the membership figures at the beginning of the 1990s showed that it had dropped to about half this number. As of 2005, BEL had 410 members in 64 countries. Most of the BEL members at that time were to be found in Bulgaria (59), Germany (56), the USA (45), Russia (35) and Great Britain (21). Right from the beginning, no membership charges were collected and, except for some donations from single National Spiritual Assemblies and other Bahá'í sources, the activities of the League were financed by voluntary contributions from its members.

In the last few years, BEL has concentrated on active participation in the Esperanto World Congresses, on the occasional publication of Bahá'í articles in Esperanto magazines, and on the translation of important Bahá'í documents: some in their entirety such as "''La Promeso de Monda Paco''" (The Promise of World Peace) in 1996, "Bahá'u'lláh" in 1992; others in the form of summaries such as in 1996 "''La prospero de la homaro''" (The Prosperity of Mankind) and "''Turnopunkto por Ĉiuj Nacioj''" (Turning Point for All Nations).

From time to time, BEL also tries to inform the Bahá'í world community about the Esperanto language and the Esperanto movement.

To celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the League, a brochure of about 60 pages was published, with the title "''Bahaismo kaj Esperanto. Festlibro okaze de la dudekkvinjariĝo de la Bahaa Esperanto-Ligo''" (Bahaism and Esperanto. Commemorative Volume for the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Bahá'í Esperanto League). In this brochure, BEL looks back on a long history of the relationship and the cooperation between Bahá'ís and Esperantists. The congratulatory openings by the Presidents of the Universal Esperanto Association (UEA) and of BEL itself are followed by Bernhard Westerhoff's essay on the changing, and not always completely harmonious, relationship between the Bahá'ís and the Esperantists. This is followed by two essays by and about Lidia Zamenhof, which show how the youngest daughter of Zamenhof found her spiritual home in the Bahá'í Religion. Several central Bahá'í texts on both the question of the international language generally and Esperanto in particular &amp;mdash; including a recent recommendation from the Bahá'ís that the UNO should adopt an international language &amp;mdash; are used to illustrate the Bahá'í point of view on this subject. A lengthy essay casts light on the historical growth of the relationship between Bahá'ís and Esperantists, presents biographical sketches of prominent Bahá'í Esperantists and describes the development of BEL. Finally an introduction to the Bahá'í Faith and an overview of Bahá'í literature in Esperanto rounds off this 60-page booklet.

One important BEL project, initiated by John Dale, is the publication of a compilation of texts, taken from the Bahá'í Writings and other sources, concerning the principle an international auxiliary language and the merits of Arabic, Persian and English as possible candidates.

==Early days==
In the 1920-1940 period Col. Raja Jai Prithvi Bahadur Singh, [[Raja]] Of [[Bajang]], traveled to Europe and the Americas and heard of the Bahá'í Faith through contact with individuals like [[Lady Blomfield]].&lt;ref name="viii"/&gt;

The first known entry of members of the Bahá'í Faith to Nepal was about 1952&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; by N. P. Sinha, an Indian Bahá'í, to Birganj&lt;ref name="BN263"/&gt; soon followed by Kedarnath Pradhan who was from [[Sikkim]] before moving to [[Kathmandu]] along with his family.&lt;ref name="anil"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Sarwal  | first = Anil  | title = Bahá'í Faith In Nepal  | work = Bahá'í Articles  | publisher = Prof. Anil Sarwal  | date =   | url = http://www.sarwal.org/BahArt/Bahai%20Index.htm  | doi =   | accessdate = 2008-09-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080920033025/http://www.sarwal.org/BahArt/Bahai%20Index.htm| archivedate= 20 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of the religion also arrived following a United Nations conference in Colombo at which Nepalese delegates expressed interest in the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = International News - India, Burma; Baha'is participate in U.N. Conference at Colombo| journal = Bahá'í News |date=August 1967 | pages = 8–9 | url = | issue = 318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following conversions and further [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] the first Local Spiritual Assembly in Nepal was that of Kathmandu city which was elected in 1959.&lt;ref name="BN353"/&gt; In 1960 there were assemblies in Kathmandu, [[Dohlka Shahr]], and [[Bhaktapur]] and smaller groups of Bahá'ís in [[Dharan, Nepal|Dharan]], [[Baklong]], [[Pokhara]], and [[Biratnagar]]; and over one hundred members of the religion.

==Growth==
By 1963 the local assemblies of Nepal included: Bhaktapur, [[Biratnagar]], Dharan, Kathmandu, and Pokhara, with small groups of Bahá'ís in [[Bodegaon]], [[Dabeha]], [[Nalar]], and [[Dolkhashahr]]. Isolated Bahá'ís were in [[Bakloong]], [[Damdame]], [[Rakhughati]], and [[Rakheshwav]]&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; and [[Hand of the Cause]] [[John Esslemont]]'s ''Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era'' was translated into [[Nepali language|Nepalese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = J. E.

With Hand of the Cause [[Ali-Akbar Furutan]] representing the Universal House of Justice, the Bahá'ís of Nepal held their first national convention to elect their [[National Spiritual Assembly]] in 1972&lt;ref name="Message63-86"/&gt; during the reign of King [[Mahendra of Nepal|Mahendra]]. The convention had forty delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = First National Convention of Nepal| journal = Bahá'í News |date=August 1967 | page = 21 | url = | issue = 495}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the first national assembly were: Amar Pradhan, Shyam Maherjan, Jujubhai Sakya, Aranda Lal Shrestha, Dinesh Verma, Keith de Folo, W. F. Chaittonalla, P. N. Rai, D. K. Malla - from Buddhist, Hindu, Christian backgrounds. In November 1972 delegates from the local assemblies of the [[Narayani Zone]] gathered for a local conference on the progress of the religion to study [[Bahá'í history]], [[Bahá'í administration]] in general and specifically electing local assemblies, and [[Bahá'í teachings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Nepal Class| journal = Bahá'í News |date=February 1973 | page = 24 | url = | issue = 503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissolution and reformation==
The national and local assemblies were all dissolved between 1976 and 1981 due to legal restrictions.&lt;ref name="rid96"/&gt; However Bahá'ís from Nepal were able to attend the October 1977 Asian Bahá'í Women's Conference with Hand of the Cause [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Historic Gathering at New Dehli| journal = Bahá'í News |date=February 1978 | pages = 6–8 | url = | issue = 563}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which she toured in Nepal including addressing some 700 students at the [[Padma Kanya Women's College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Around the World; Nepal| journal = Bahá'í News |date=June 1978 | page = 17 | url = | issue = 503}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Kathmandu District#Education|Education in Nepal]].) In May 1981 45 Nepalese Bahá'ís from various localities attended a conference at the national center in Kathmandu. A highlight of the weekend conference was the first showing in Nepal of the film ''The Green Light Expedition'' about Rúhíyyih Khanum's trip up the Amazon River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = The World; Nepal| journal = Bahá'í News |date=March 1982 | issn=0195-9212 | page = 14 | url = | issue = 812}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local and national assemblies were reelected in and since 1982&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/hassall_nsas_years_formation Notes on Research on National Spiritual Assemblies] Asia Pacific Bahá'í Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; - this dissolution and reformation was during the reign of King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]].

Since the early 1990s the Bahá'ís of Nepal have involved themselves in diverse concerns in Nepal.

One group of Bahá'ís set up an organization "Education, Curriculum, and Training Associates", or "ECTA", which means "unity" in Nepali, in 1997 to promote rural development strategies and programs that can be done at low cost by village groups without extensive outside aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

'''Bazigar''' are the descendants of Bhai Lehna Ji (also known as the second guru of Sikhs [[Sri Guru Angad Dev Ji|Shri Guru Angad Dev Ji]]). This tribe generally follows [[Sikhism]]. Bazigar is a concentrated community so it is declared as [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Castes]] in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Haryana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. They speak the [[Bazigar language]], which belongs to the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian family]].

== Origin ==

The name Bazigar is derived from the [[Urdu]] word ''bazi'', which means an acrobat. They themselves claim to be the Descendants of Bhai Lehna Ji (Also known as Second Guru of Sikhism Shri Guru Angad Dev Ji) who took to the occupation of acrobatics and Music. They have now been granted [[Scheduled Caste]] status in [[Haryana]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]] because it is a Concentrated community. At some places in India, Bazigars speak [[Bazigar language|their own dialect]], which is [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], while speaking in [[Hindi]] or [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] with outsiders. In [[Haryana]], they are founded mainly in the districts of Yamuna Nagar, [[Ambala District|Ambala]], [[Kurukshetra]], [[Rohtak District|Rohtak]], [[Sirsa District|Sirsa]], [[Fatehabad District|Fatehabad]], [[Karnal District|Karnal]] while in [[Punjab, India]] they can be founded in [[Doaba]], [[Majha]], and [[Malwa]] regions mainly in [[Amritsar]], [[Hoshiarpur]], [[Pathankot]][[Jalandhar|, and Jalandhar]] districts. Major Bazigar clans in Haryana and Punjab includes the Binjhrawat, Baljot, Bartiya (Lalka), Dharamsot, Muchhaal (Gutteka, Gurdaseka, Lashiaka, Mastaneka etc) and Namsot.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Hayana Volume XXIII edited by M.L Sharma and A.K Bhatia pages 63 to 67 Manohar&lt;/ref&gt;

In all these clans, Baljot were treated as their leaders and Bartiya as the advisors of them. But they all lived together and was famous for their unity during the bad times of each other. 

In terms of Religion, major part of Baazigar community claims to be the [[Hindu]] ''',''' but basically they are the Descendants of Shri Guru Angad Dev Ji. They belongs to [[Sikhism]]. The occupation of the Male was performing Acrobatics, wrestling and Agriculture.

But with the growth of the world, these things are dissapearing as this community is also marked theirselves as Modern in the modern world. Now they are almost in all countries of the world and giving their services in almost every field.

The Bazigar community is further divided into Six Gotras, the Dharamsot, Muchhaal, Baljot (Rupana), Bartiya (Lalka), Binjhrawat and Namsot. Historically, the Bazigar were either [[Sikh]] or [[Hindu]] but with the departure of their [[Muslim]] patrons, the Bazigar have embraced [[Sikhism]]. They have also abandoned their traditional dialect to Communicate during the Wars while fighting with the [[Mughals]].

It is still a confusion weather Bazigars are Sikh or Hindu because there is no written evidence, but the major part believes in [[Sikhism]] as they perform their all functions according to Sikhism and follow [[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ji. 

[[Wadali Brothers]] ( Ustad Puran Chand Wadali ji and Ustad Pyare Lal Wadali ji ) are the pride of Bazigar Community. Their son [[Lakhwinder Wadali]] is also a famous Indian Singer.

In Politics, S. [[Sadhu Singh Dharamsot]] is presenting Bazigar community from a long time.

{{Jainism}}

'''Common Attributes''' is a technical term in Jainism. As per [[Jain Cosmology|Jain Cosmology]], Universe is made up of [[Dravya|Principles]] or Substances that are infinite in number but six by categories. All [[Dravya|Principles]] or Substances have Attributes that pervade in the entire [[Dravya|Principle]]. In other words, Attributes have exactly same extent(volume) as the Substance. In addition to occupying same space as the Substance, Attributes stay in the Substance at all the time without any exception. "Common Attributes" are those attributes that are common among all the six categories of [[Dravya|Principles]].

Presence of "Common Attributes" doesn't mean all individual Substances somehow lose their individual identities and acquire one singular identity. Each individual substance continues to maintain its individual identity.  Identity of common attribute is identical with the identity of the substance in which it resides.

There are infinite number of "Common Attributes", but following six are important ones:

* Astitva (Indestructability)
* Vastutva (Functionality)
* Dravyatva (Changability)
* Praveyatva (Knowability)
* Agurulaghutva (Inviolable Individuality)
* Pradeshtva (Spatiality)

'''Complementarianism''' is a theological view held by some in [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]],&lt;!--
     --&gt;&lt;ref name="Complementarianism"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9WF1fRGOsQC&amp;pg=PA200 |title=Women Embracing Islam: Gender and Conversion in the West |author=Karin van Nieuwkerk |quote=Secular feminists in Muslim societies demanded full equality in the public sphere, calling for access to education, work, and political participation as part of women's self-development and the empowering of the society in the decolonizing process. Within this feminist framework women accepted the notion of complementarity in the private sphere, upholding the notion of male predominance, regarded as benevolent predominance in the family. They called upon men to fulfill their duties, protecting and providing in ways that upheld the rights and dignity of women. |publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] |accessdate=2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
 --&gt; that [[men]] and [[women]] have different but ''complementary'' roles and responsibilities in [[marriage]], [[family]] life, [[List of religious leaders in 2008|religious leadership]], and elsewhere. The word "complementary" and its cognates are currently used&lt;ref name="19 objections"/&gt; to denote this view.  For some Christians whose complementarian view is [[biblically]]-prescribed, these separate roles preclude women from specific functions of ministry within the community.&lt;ref name="NTWright"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Women_Service_Church.htm |last=Wright |first=N.T. |authorlink=N. T. Wright |title=Women’s Service in the Church: The Biblical Basis. |date=4 Sep 2004 |accessdate=12 Jul 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blomberg |first1=Craig |last2=Markley |first2=Jennifer Foutz |title=Handbook of New Testament Exegesis |date=1 November 2010 |publisher=Baker Academic |isbn=080103177X |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though women may be precluded from certain roles and ministries they are held to be equal in moral value and of equal status. The phrase used to describe this is 'Ontologically equal, Functionally different'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood|last=Piper|first=John|publisher=Crossway|year=1991|isbn=9781856840453|location=Wheaton, Illinois|pages=31–59|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complementarians assign primary ''headship'' roles to men and ''support'' roles to women—based on their interpretation of certain biblical passages. One of the precepts of complementarianism is that while women may assist in the decision-making process, the ultimate authority for the decision is the purview of the male in marriage, courtship, and in the polity of churches subscribing to this view.

The main contrasting viewpoints are [[Christian egalitarianism|egalitarianism]] which maintains positions of authority and responsibility in marriage, religion, business, and elsewhere should be equally available to females as well as males, and 'male [[chauvinism]]', a generalized bias that in most situations men are of significantly greater value than women.

== Christianity ==

Complementarianism holds that "God has created men and women equal in their essential dignity and human personhood, but different and complementary in function with male headship in the home and in the Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Duncan | first=Ligon | title=Male Authority and Female Equality: In the beginning—Genesis 1-3 being understood as part of God’s created design | publisher=Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood | date=2004-12-15 | url=http://www.cbmw.org/Resources/Sermons/Male-Authority-and-Female-Equality-In-the-beginning-Genesis-1-3 | accessdate=2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of complementarianism generally see the Bible as the infallible word of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boa|first=Kenneth|title=All About Eve: Feminism and the Meaning of Equality|url=http://bible.org/seriespage/all-about-eve-feminism-and-meaning-equality|work=Mission for the Third Millennium|accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complementarian position claims to uphold what has been the most traditional teaching&lt;ref&gt;Broken Link [http://peacebyjesus.witnesstoday.org/1Cor.11+14.html#Commentaries Historical/traditional interpretation of women speaking in the church; Commentaries]&lt;/ref&gt; on gender roles in the church. However, the terms ''traditionalist'' or ''hierarchicalist'' are usually avoided by complementarians, as the former “implies an unwillingness to let Scripture challenge traditional patterns of behavior”, while the latter “overemphasizes structured authority while giving no suggestion of equality or the beauty of mutual interdependence”. Therefore, they prefer the term complementarian, “since it suggests both equality and beneficial differences”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbmw.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/RBMW.pdf Recovering Biblical manhood and womanhood], p. 11, Edited by John Piper and Wayne Grudem&lt;/ref&gt;

While not doctrine by name, many Catholics are advocates of complementarianism with regard to the [[Catholic social teaching|social doctrine of the Church]]. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] asserts that "God gives man and woman an equal personal dignity"&lt;ref name="CCC2334"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P84.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church |accessdate=2009-12-15 |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115202352/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P84.HTM |archivedate=2010-01-15 |df= }} sections 2333-2335.&lt;/ref&gt; but also that the harmony of society "depends in part on the way in which the complementarity, needs, and mutual support between the sexes are lived out."&lt;ref name="CCC2334" /&gt;

In contrast with adherents of [[Biblical patriarchy]], some complementarians are open to the possibility of women assuming leadership roles in civic and commercial life.

=== Roles in marriage ===

The complementarian view of marriage asserts gender-based roles in marriage.&lt;ref name="BFM2000" /&gt; A husband is considered to have the God-given responsibility to provide for, protect, and lead his family. A wife is to collaborate with her husband, respect him, and serve as his helper in managing the household and nurturing the next generation. Complementarians assert that the Bible instructs husbands to lead their families as Head of Household, and to love their wives as [[Jesus in Christianity|Christ]] loves the Church. They cite the Bible as instructing wives to respect their husbands’ leadership out of reverence for Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbmw.org/About-Us |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130045824/http://www.cbmw.org/About-Us |archive-date=2009-01-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFMComp"&gt;http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfmcomparison.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The husband is also meant to hold moral accountability for his wife and to exhibit a sacrificial love for her.

An example of the complementarian view of marriage can be found in the Southern Baptist Convention's ''[[Baptist Faith and Message]] (2000)'',&lt;ref name="BFMComp" /&gt; an excerpt from which is quoted here:

{{quotation|The husband and wife are of equal worth before God, since both are created in God's image. The marriage relationship models the way God relates to his people. A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the church. He has the God-given responsibility to provide for, to protect, and to lead his family. A wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as the church willingly submits to the headship of Christ. She, being in the image of God as is her husband and thus equal to him, has the God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as his helper in managing the household and nurturing the next generation.|''Article XVIII. The Family.'' [[Baptist Faith and Message]] 2000}}

The [[Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood]] teaches that "Christ is the supreme authority and guide for men and women, so that no earthly submission—domestic, religious, or civil—ever implies a mandate to follow a human authority into sin."&lt;ref name="Danvers"&gt;[http://www.CBMW.org/Danvers "Core Beliefs: The Danvers Statement on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103040658/http://www.cbmw.org/Danvers |date=2010-11-03 }} Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (CBMW), 1987. Web:13 Jul 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression ''[[Sponsa Christi]]'' is sometimes used by complementarian denominations such as the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]]. They maintain that [[Paul of Tarsus|the apostle Paul]]  advocated such views in the New Testament. Accordingly, the Christ symbolizes the bridegroom, while the Church ''(Ecclesia)'' represents the bride.&lt;ref&gt;[http://witness.lcms.org/pages/wPage.asp?IssueID=24&amp;ContentID=343 God's Design for Marriage] Christopher Mitchell, The Lutheran Witness, accessed 2-27-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roles in the Church ===

Based on their interpretation of certain scriptures complementarians view women's roles in ministry, particularly in church settings, as limited.&lt;ref name="Danvers" /&gt; The complementarian view holds that women should not hold church leadership roles that involve teaching or authority over men.&lt;ref name="19 objections"&gt;{{cite web | last=Duncan | first=Ligon | title=19 Objections to Complementarianism — 1 Timothy 2:8-15 | publisher=Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood | date=2004-12-15 |url=http://www.cbmw.org/sermon.php?id=22 |accessdate=2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance, [[Frank Page (Southern Baptist)|Frank Page]], a former president of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], has written that "...while both men and women are gifted for service in the church, the office of Pastor is limited to men as qualified by Scripture."&lt;ref name="Page2011"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Page |first1=Frank |authorlink1=Frank Page (Southern Baptist) |title=Focus on Doctrine The Church~Who Is In Charge? |url=https://sbclife.net/article/2042/sbc-life-focus-on-doctrine-the-churchwho-is-in-charge |website=SBC Life |publisher=[[Southern Baptist Convention]] |accessdate=14 June 2018 |date=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFM2000" /&gt; According to complementarianism, women are not completely forbidden from speaking within a church since Paul speaks about women prophesying inside the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boa|first=Kenneth|title=All About Eve: Feminism and the Meaning of Equality|url=http://bible.org/seriespage/all-about-eve-feminism-and-meaning-equality#P149_66163|work=Mission for the Third Millennium|accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood]] holds that “[i]n the church, redemption in Christ gives men and women an equal share in the blessings of salvation. Nevertheless, they strongly believe that certain governing and teaching roles within the church are restricted to men ({{Bibleref2|1Cor|14:33-38|esv|1 Cor|14:33-38}}; {{Bibleref2-nb|1Cor|11:2-16||1 Cor 11:2-16}}; {{Bibleref2|1Tim|2:11-15||1 Tim 2:11-15}}).”&lt;ref name="Danvers" /&gt; Most complementarians believe that women should not be ordained as a pastor or as an evangelist, while a few believe that it is acceptable for women to be evangelists but not pastors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Clouse | first=Robert G | title=Women in Ministry: Four Views |publisher=InterVarsity Press |year=1989 | ISBN=0-8308-1284-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would not support placing women in leadership roles in the church or family that would imply or provide any authority over men. Which other specific ministry roles are open to women varies among complementarians.&lt;ref name="BFM2000"&gt;http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp ''The 2000 Baptist Faith and Message'', [[Southern Baptist Convention]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article "Women Preachers, Divorce, and a Gay Bishop–What’s the Link?", Southern Baptist theologian and seminary president [[Albert Mohler]] asserts that "The arguments used in support of the ordination of women require the dismissal or 'reinterpretation' of specific biblical texts which disallow women in the teaching office". He believes the same is true of arguments for the ordination of divorced persons and for homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertmohler.com/2003/08/05/women-preachers-divorce-and-a-gay-bishop-whats-the-link Mohler, Albert, "Women Preachers, Divorce, and a Gay Bishop–What’s the Link?"] August 5, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Some traditionally Catholic countries have been called [[matriarchal]] because of the high value that was placed on women. Numerous women have been beatified and who are venerated among the [[Roman Martyrology|saints]]. However, the Catholic Church restricts [[ordination]] to men, since "The Lord Jesus chose men (''viri'') to form the college of the [[twelve apostles]], and the apostles did the same when they chose collaborators to succeed them in their ministry".&lt;ref name="CCC1577"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4X.HTM | title=Catechism of the Catholic Church | accessdate=2010-01-29 | publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana}} section 1577.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complementarian advocates ==

===Christian denominations===
[[Christian denominations]] that support complementarianism include many conservative [[Protestant]] denominations (as well as many non-denominational Protestant churches), the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches.&lt;ref name = "Evangelical, Catholic, Orthodox"&gt;{{cite book| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=DgYnlWKyTIsC&amp;pg=PA481 |title=Christian Thought: A Historical Introduction|author=Chad Meister, J.

===Parachurch organizations===
[[Parachurch organizations]] that have been described as complementarian include [[Focus on the Family]], [[Cru (Christian organization)|Cru]], and [[Promise Keepers]]. Focus on the Family and the Promise Keepers do not take a position on women in the church, but both believe in male headship in the family. Campus Crusade for Christ "has not taken any role of women in ministry", though its [[FamilyLife]] organization directed by Dennis Rainey sponsors "Weekend to Remember" marriage conferences which reportedly teach male headship.&lt;ref name = "Organization"&gt;{{cite book| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=duzJFC6wVYoC&amp;pg=PT338 |title=''Countering the Claims of Evangelical Feminism''|author=[[Wayne A.

Both have decided not to take any official stand on the role of women in the church, but both uphold male headship in the home. In its official policies, Campus Crusade for Christ also falls in this category since the organization has not taken any role of women in ministry, while Family Life, a division of Campus Crusade under the direction of Dennis Rainey, clearly teaches male headship in the home at its "Weekend to Remember" marriage conferences.

==Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood==
{{main article|Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood}}
The Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (CBMW) is the primary [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christian]] organization that exists to promote the complementarian view of gender issues.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Skinner Keller, Rosemary Radford Ruether, and Marie Cantlon (2006), ''Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America'', Indiana University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=we2KvdT3zOsC&amp;pg=PA468 p. 468].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Cochran (2005), ''Evangelical Feminism: a History'', NYU Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KZAA8oBvKjQC&amp;pg=PA160 p. 160].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agnieszka Tennant, "[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/march11/4.58.html Nuptial Agreements]," ''Christianity Today'', March 11, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; CBMW's current president is Denny Burk&lt;ref&gt;CBMW web site: [http://cbmw.org/topics/complementarianism/an-interview-with-cbmws-new-president-denny-burk/], accessed 2 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; who is also a professor of Biblical Studies at [[Boyce College|Boyce Bible College]], the undergraduate wing of The [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]].

== Complementarian movements within feminism ==

''[[New feminism]]'' is a predominantly [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] philosophy which emphasizes a belief in an integral complementarity of men and women, rather than the superiority of men over women or women over men.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Sr. [[Prudence Allen]]. 'Man-Woman Complementarity: the Catholic Inspiration.' ''Logos'' 9, issue 3 (Summer 2006) [http://www.endowonline.com/File/spComplementary.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Difference feminism]]'' is a philosophy that stresses that [[men]] and [[women]] are [[ontology|ontologically]] different versions of the human being. Many [[Catholic]]s adhere to and have written on the philosophy, though the philosophy is not specifically Catholic.

== Criticism ==
According to [[Christians for Biblical Equality]] (CBE), an organization that adopts a [[Christian egalitarianism|Christian egalitarian]] approach, complementarianism "sidesteps the question at issue, which is not whether there are beneficial differences between men and women, but whether these differences warrant the inequitable roles, rights, and opportunities prescribed by advocates of gender hierarchy."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbeinternational.org/?q=content/complementarians—whats-name&lt;/ref&gt; CBE prefaces their criticism with acknowledgement of some positions they share in common with complementarians: a mutual love for and commitment to [[Jesus Christ]], a commitment to justice as a biblical ideal,  a devotion to Scripture as being God-inspired, and a desire to see the world embrace the gospel of Christ.&lt;ref name=CBE&gt;Haddad, Mimi. ''President's Message: Egalitarians and Complementarians. One Gospel, Two Worldviews''. ''Mutuality'', Summer 2014, vol. 21, no. 2. Online: http://www.cbeinternational.org/resources/article/presidents-message-egalitarians-and-complementarians {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615014957/http://www.cbeinternational.org/resources/article/presidents-message-egalitarians-and-complementarians |date=2015-06-15 }}, Accessed: 21 Apr 2015&lt;/ref&gt; They are divided by worldviews that CBE sees as reflecting the moral teachings of God and their purposes in this world. CBE maintains that these differing views have "enormous consequences". The writer, CBE's President Mimi Haddad, finds that Christians are now divided over [[patriarchy]] as they once were over [[slavery]]. She characterizes those as different views of the nature, purpose, and value of humanity, all based on gender.&lt;ref name=CBE/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"  border="1" cellpadding="1"

|Since patriarchy is part of the ''biblical narrative'', God must not oppose it.||Eve sinned by disobeying Adam, showing that the ''nature'' of females is not suited for ruling or authority.||God’s purpose for females is obedience to males, who are created to lead.||Social structures that support patriarchy advance God’s justice, since Scripture, nature, and God’s purposes endorse patriarchy.
|}

Haddad asks the rhetorical question: "If male authority is part of God’s design, we would expect to see society flourish where patriarchy holds sway. Is this the case?" The author replies:
{{Quotation|Not at all. In what constitutes the largest human holocaust in history, two hundred million girls are missing from the world, primarily in places where patriarchy is most rampant. The face of poverty, abuse, disease, malnutrition, illiteracy, and hunger is mostly female. Not surprisingly, the international think tank, The Millennium Project, which tackles humanity’s most challenging problems, recognizes gender equality and empowering women (in other words, dismantling patriarchy) as “essential for addressing the global challenges facing humanity.”&lt;ref&gt;“How can the changing status of women help improve the human condition?” http://millennium-project.org/millennium/Global_Challenges/chall-11.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Patriarchy does not advance God’s justice, but is an injustice that must be overcome.

Dismantling patriarchy will require a worldview that perceives male rule as a result of sin; it distorts the nature of men and women as equals and their intended purpose to use their gifts with shared authority. Justice and the gospel are furthered when superiority and dominance are challenged by human equality—a biblical ideal.&lt;ref name=CBE/&gt;}}Some Traditional Christians do not accept this premise as it focuses on a sociological over a theological category, thus denouncing the egalitarian position as idolatry. Instead they believe it is not hegemony that causes God's wrath but sinfulness which is no less present among women than men. Further, they would re-emphasize ontological equality and functional difference, not patriarchy, as the foundational difference between complementarian and egalitarian views.

== Other religions ==
Differentiation of women's roles on the basis of religious beliefs are not unique to Christianity or Western culture.&lt;ref name="Joseph" /&gt;

===Judaism===
Different movements in Judaism have adopted differing views in gender relations.  The [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson|Lubavitcher Rebbe]] stated, "In the Divine plan for creation, men and women have distinct, diverse missions. These missions complement each other, and together bring the Divine plan to harmonious fruition. The role of one is neither higher nor lower than the role of the other: they are simply different."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/partner-in-the-dynamic-of-creation/07.htm Rights and Priorities - Discrimination?]—a public address of the [[Lubavitcher Rebbe]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrasting this, the [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish movement]] is entirely egalitarian, both in services and in daily life.  In North America, the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative movement]] is likewise predominantly egalitarian.  Although egalitarianism has been adopted in services and life by some of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewry]], complementarianism continues to be more prevalent in Orthodox communities.

===Islam===
Within [[Islam]], "a tension exists between the egalitarian view that believers are judged on the basis of merit and the inegalitarian view that women and men should fulfill distinct, complementary roles in the family and society".&lt;ref name="Joseph"&gt;{{cite book | last=Joseph | first=Suad | author2=Afsaneh Najmabadi | title=Encyclopedia of women &amp; Islamic cultures | publisher=Brill | year=2003 | ISBN=90-04-12819-0 | page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baha'i===
The [[Baha'i Faith]], proclaims that equality is not to deny that differences in function between women and men exist but rather to affirm the complementary roles men and women fulfill in the home and society at large. "“The world of humanity is possessed of two wings: the male and the female. So long as these two wings are not equivalent in strength, the bird will not fly. Until womankind reaches the same degree as man, until she enjoys the same arena of activity, extraordinary attainment for humanity will not be realized; humanity cannot wing its way to heights of real attainment. When the two wings . . . become equivalent in strength, enjoying the same prerogatives, the flight of man will be exceedingly lofty and extraordinary.”.&lt;ref name="Abdu'l-Baha"&gt;{{cite book | author=Abdu'l-Baha | title=The Promulgation of Universal Peace | publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust | year=1982 | ISBN=0-87743-172-8 | page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=September 2015}}

'''Edwina Currie''' (''née'' '''Cohen'''; born 13 October 1946) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] former politician, serving as [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] [[Member of Parliament]] from 1983 until 1997. She was a Junior Health Minister for two years, resigning in 1988 during the [[salmonella]] in [[egg (food)|eggs]] controversy.

By the time Currie lost her seat as an MP in 1997, she had begun a new career as a novelist and broadcaster. She is the author of six novels, and has also written four works of non fiction. In September 2002, publication of Currie's ''Diaries (1987–92)'' caused a sensation, as they revealed a four-year affair with colleague (and later Prime Minister) [[John Major]] between 1984 and 1988.

==Early life==
Currie was born in south [[Liverpool]] to an [[Orthodox Jewish]] family, who "disowned her when she married a non-Jewish accountant."&lt;ref&gt;William D. Rubinstein, Michael Jolles, Hilary L. Rubinstein, ''The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History'', Palgrave Macmillan (2011), p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; She is however not particularly religious, stating in an February 2000 interview that she found "religious mumbo jumbo hard to swallow in any faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Edwina Currie: You ask the questions|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/you-ask-the-questions-726035.html|accessdate=20 April 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=9 February 2000|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went to the [[Liverpool Institute High School for Girls]] in [[Blackburne House]], in the [[Canning, Liverpool|Canning]] area of Liverpool, where she was deputy Head Girl.

Currie studied [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] at [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], where she was taught by [[Gabriele Taylor]]. She lived next door to [[Mary Archer]], [[Ann Widdecombe]], and [[Gyles Brandreth]]'s wife Michèle Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Have I Got News For You, Series 25 Episode 6 with Hugh Dennis, Gyles Brandreth &amp; Martin Freeman|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTZWT0OMpy0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, she gained an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in [[economic history]] from the [[London School of Economics]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Parliamentary career==
From 1975 until 1986, she was a [[Birmingham City Council]]lor for [[Northfield, West Midlands|Northfield]]. In 1983, she stood for parliament as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] candidate, and was elected as the member for [[South Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Derbyshire]]. Frequently outspoken, she was described as "a virtually permanent fixture on the nation's TV screen saying something outrageous about just about anything" and "the most outspoken and sexually interested woman of her political generation."&lt;ref name=Assinider&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2286269.stm "Westminster's odd couple"], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 28 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1986, she became a Junior Health Minister. Among her comments over the next two years were—despite her not being religious—that "good [[Christianity|Christian]] people" don't get [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/on-this-day/Mrs-Currie-dishes-up-AIDS.2056427.jp |title=Mrs Currie dishes up AIDS advice |work=Yorkshire Post |date=13 February 1987 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that old people who couldn't afford their heating bills should wrap up warm in winter and that [[Northern England|northerners]] die of "ignorance and chips".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_2519000/2519451.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &amp;#124; 3 &amp;#124; 1988: Egg industry fury over salmonella claim |publisher=BBC News |date=3 December 1984 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Currie appointed television personality [[Jimmy Savile]] to head up a task force to run the [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor]] [[psychiatric hospital]]. Savile was given extraordinary power and a set of keys with complete access to every part of the hospital. He [[Sexual assault|mingled]] repeatedly with the 800 or so patients, many teenage girls, some severely disturbed and medicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/broadmoor-savile-was-a-lunatic-in-charge-of-the-asylum|title=Broadmoor: Savile was 'a lunatic in charge of the asylum'|website=Channel 4 News|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salmonella in eggs controversy===
Currie was forced to resign in December 1988, after she issued a warning about [[salmonella]] in British [[egg (food)|eggs]]. The statement that "most of the egg production in this country, sadly, is now affected with salmonella"&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_2519000/2519451.stm "1988: Egg industry fury over salmonella claim"], ''On this Day'', [[BBC News Online]], 3 December 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; sparked outrage among farmers and egg producers, and caused egg sales in the country to decline rapidly, by 60 percent. The controversy gained her the nickname "Eggwina".

The loss of revenue led to the slaughter of four million hens.&lt;ref name=BBCSept282002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25154046 "1988: Egg industry fury over salmonella claim"], ''Why are we more scared of raw egg than reheated rice?'', [[BBC News Online]], 3 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the statement was widely interpreted as referring to "most eggs produced", in fact it related to the egg production ''flock''; there was indeed evidence that a mid-1980s regulation change had allowed salmonella to get a hold in flocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/elibrary/industry/code-practice-egg-cop/egg-cop-append-c.pdf Egg Producers Federation of New Zealand Inc Code of Practice, 2002, Appendix C] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315153400/http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/elibrary/industry/code-practice-egg-cop/egg-cop-append-c.pdf |date=15 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Currie failed to clarify this distinction.

There was particular anger in [[Northern Ireland]] where egg production is a significant part of the economy. At the Christmas party of the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland that year the featured dish was [[curry|curried]] eggs. To make amends, in 1990, she began the National Egg Awareness Campaign.

Long after the furore died down, in 2001, it was revealed that a [[Cover-up|covered-up]] [[Whitehall]] report produced months after Currie's resignation found that there had been a "salmonella epidemic of considerable proportions."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1366276/Currie-was-right-on-salmonella.html The Telegraph newspaper: Currie 'was right' on salmonella]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-ministerial career as an MP===
In 1991, Currie became the first Conservative MP to appear on the BBC topical panel show ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''. She appeared again two years later, in a special episode commemorating the release of Margaret Thatcher's memoirs, opposite fellow Liverpudlian (and Liverpool Institute alumnus) [[Derek Hatton]].

During the 1992 General Election campaign, Currie poured a glass of [[orange juice]] over [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s [[Peter Snape]] shortly after an edition of the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] based television debate show ''[[Central Weekend]]'' had finished airing.&lt;ref name="orange juice"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/29/world/tories-say-party-s-strategy-is-hurting-campaign.html|title= Tories Say Party's Strategy Is Hurting Campaign|work= New York Times|first= Craig R.|last= Whitney|date= 29 March 1992|accessdate= 3 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking about the incident later, Currie said "I just looked at my orange juice, and looked at this man from which this stream of abuse was emanating, and thought 'I know how to shut you up.'"&lt;ref name="orange juice"/&gt;

After the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 General Election]], she declined a request from Prime Minister [[John Major]] to take up a position as [[Home Secretary|Minister of State for the Home Office]].&lt;ref name=BBCOct2002&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2291467.stm "Currie interview in full"], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 2 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1994, she tabled an amendment to the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill]] to lower the [[age of consent]] for homosexual sexual acts to 16. This amendment was defeated by 307 votes to 280, although a subsequent amendment resulted in the reduction of the homosexual age of consent from 21 to 18; [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000|final equalisation]] was achieved in 2000. That same month, Currie voted against the death penalty for murder, having previously voted in favour of it in 1983.

In June 1994, she contested the European Parliament seat of [[Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes (European Parliament constituency)|Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes]], but lost the seat to Labour's [[Eryl McNally]] by 94,837 votes to 61,628 votes. After fourteen years as a member of the House of Commons, Currie lost her parliamentary seat of South Derbyshire in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 General Election]]. She attempted to be selected as a Conservative candidate for the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (United Kingdom)|European Parliament election of 1999]], but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=HTlaCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=Andrew+Pearce+pro-euro&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0aNCUCe13D&amp;sig=L3zEoCDrq5RqosDOihcuZi-q0ys&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxvNqK6-jMAhWJLsAKHaswATsQ6AEIODAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Andrew%20Pearce%20pro-euro&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
From the time she lost her seat in 1997, Currie has maintained a presence in the media. From 1998 to 2003, she hosted a late evening talk show on [[BBC Radio Five Live]], ''Late Night Currie''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edwina.currie.co.uk/html/broadcasting_right.htm Broadcasting career], Edwina Currie's official website&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, she moved to [[ITV Wales &amp; West|HTV]], presenting the television programme ''Currie Night'' until 2003. Since then, she has appeared in a string of reality television programmes, such as ''[[Wife Swap (UK TV series)|Wife Swap]]'' in which she and her second husband John swapped places with [[John McCririck]] and his wife, Jenny. Currie appeared on a charity edition of the television quiz show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (UK game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' on 17 September 2005, partnering Conservative speech-writer and lobbyist [[Derek Laud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/815178 |title=Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?: Celebrity Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? |accessdate=4 November 2012 |publisher=BFI}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also appeared in the reality cooking show ''[[Hell's Kitchen (UK TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' with celebrity chef [[Gordon Ramsay]], and ''[[Celebrity Stars in Their Eyes]]'', both in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edwina.currie.co.uk/html/general_info.htm General information], Edwina Currie's official website&lt;/ref&gt;

Currie was interviewed about the rise of [[Thatcherism]] for the 2006 [[BBC TV]] documentary series ''[[Tory! Tory!

She made a second appearance on the show during Channel 4's "Alternative Election Night" coverage, with [[Rod Liddle]], [[Brian Paddick]] and [[Derek Hatton]] as her competitors. She also appeared in James May's Show ''[[James May's Toy Stories]]'' where she helped him build a bridge made entirely out of [[Meccano]] in Liverpool.

In September 2011, Currie took part in the [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 9)|ninth series]] of ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14809342 | title=Strictly Come Dancing signs up Lulu and Edwina Currie | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | work=BBC News | date=6 September 2011 | accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was paired with professional dancer [[Vincent Simone]]. On 9 October, she and Simone were the first couple to be eliminated from the competition.

In November 2014, Currie took part in the [[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK series 14)|fourteenth series]] of ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!

==Personal life==
On 1 July 1972, Currie married accountant Ray Currie in [[Barnstaple]], Devon; they had two children and divorced in 1997. During this marriage Edwina Currie had a four-year affair with [[John Major]], later Prime Minister, which she revealed in September 2002. Edwina and Ray were the subject of an edition of the BBC's ''The Other Half'' documentary series, broadcast in March 1984.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

On 24 May 2001, in [[Southwark]], Currie married retired detective John Jones, whom she had met when he was a guest on her radio programme in 1999.&lt;ref name=ECFAQ&gt;[http://edwina.currie.co.uk/html/standard_qanda.htm Frequently asked questions], Edwina Currie's official website, 1 September 2004. Retrieved 11 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Currie lives in [[Whaley Bridge]], Derbyshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Whaley Bridge's Edwina sparks more controversy|url=http://www.buxtonadvertiser.co.uk/news/local/whaley-bridge-s-edwina-sparks-more-controversy-1-6452265|work=Buxton Advertiser|accessdate=27 April 2014|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affair with John Major===
Currie's ''Diaries (1987–92)'', published in 2002, caused a sensation, as they revealed a four-year affair with [[John Major]] between 1984 and 1988, while both were married to other people. The affair started while she was a [[backbencher]] and Major was the government whip in [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s government. After Major's promotion to [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], the relationship ended, but the two remained friends. Currie apparently ceased the affair when it became dangerous and impractical owing to the presence of bodyguards who had to be avoided.&lt;ref name=BBCOct2002/&gt;

After publication, Major made a statement saying that he was ashamed of the affair and had privately revealed the matter to his wife. Currie said she had been in love with him for years after the end of the affair,&lt;ref name=BBCSept28affair&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2286008.stm "Major and Currie had four-year affair"], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 28 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and that he had been "the love of her life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/johnmajorsaffair/The-Major-love-story.2365303.jp "The Major love story"], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 30 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, only weeks after revealing the affair, she publicly criticised Major, accusing him of sexism and racism and of being "one of the less competent prime ministers".&lt;ref name=BBCOct2blasts&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2294229.stm "Currie blasts Major's record in power"], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 2 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

While having an affair with Major in October 1985, Currie said about [[Sara Keays]], "I feel very sorry for Cecil and his family. Most of my thoughts on Sara Keays are unprintable. Perhaps the most polite thing to say is she's a right cow."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreelibrary.com/'A+RIGHT+COW+'+EXCLUSIVE%3A+What+Edwina+called+Sara+Keays+for+kissing...-a092259742&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=December 2018}}

The admission came after years of denial of any affair while in office and a successful libel action against playwright [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]], who had said a sexually voracious murderer played by [[Charlotte Rampling]] in his film ''Paris by Night'' (1988) was an "Edwina Currie-like" figure. Currie had also produced several novels with explicitly erotic content – and political background – such as  ''A Parliamentary Affair''.&lt;ref name=BBCSept282002/&gt; Following publication of her diaries, [[Express Newspapers]] lawyers re-examined documents in a libel case to see if there was anything in the diaries which would allow them to reopen the case and recoup damages.&lt;ref name=lib&gt;{{cite news|title='Express' re-examines Currie libel papers|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/express-reexamines-currie-libel-papers-613414.html|publisher=Independent Newspapers|first=Robert |last=Verkaik|date=7 October 2002|accessdate=28 January 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2000, Currie had been awarded £30,000 against them following a 1997 article entitled "How Edwina is now the vilest lady in Britain."&lt;ref name=lib/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/671514.stm|title=Currie wins "vilest lady" libel case|publisher=BBC News|date=9 March 2000|accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity and other interests===
In September 2004, Currie took part in a sponsored cycle ride across Poland, near to the area where ancestors of hers lived, for [[Marie Curie Cancer Care]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mariecurie.org.uk/aboutus/news/news_archive/news_archive_2004/edwina_transforms_herself_into_marie_curie_for_polish_cycling_challenge.htm Edwina transforms herself into Marie Curie for Polish cycling challenge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212215537/http://www.mariecurie.org.uk/aboutus/news/news_archive/news_archive_2004/edwina_transforms_herself_into_marie_curie_for_polish_cycling_challenge.htm |date=12 December 2007 }}, [[Marie Curie Cancer Care]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, in her role as a patron of the [[British Heart Foundation]], Currie championed a campaign to raise awareness of the effect of heart disease on women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4613543.stm | work=BBC News | title=Heart campaign targets UK women | date=6 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, the patient charity MRSA Action UK announced Currie as their patron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mrsaactionuk.net/MRSA%20ACTION%20UK%20Welcomes%20Edwina%20Currie%20as%20our%20Patron.pdf mrsaactionuk.net]&lt;/ref&gt;
Edwina Currie was quoted by the media championing the campaign against hospital superbugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtoday.co.uk/index.php/Infection-Control/superbugs-the-continuing-problem.html govtoday.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813080246/http://www.govtoday.co.uk/index.php/Infection-Control/superbugs-the-continuing-problem.html |date=13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, Currie took part in [[EuroVoice]], an event supported by the [[European Youth Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eypuk.co.uk/liverpool-eurvoice-a-%e2%80%98strictly%e2%80%99-inspirational-event eypuk.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404035640/http://eypuk.co.uk/liverpool-eurvoice-a-%e2%80%98strictly%e2%80%99-inspirational-event |date=4 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, Currie accepted the position of President of the [[Tideswell]] Male Voice Choir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tideswellmvc.co.uk/pages/news.shtml News – Our New President] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001450/http://www.tideswellmvc.co.uk/pages/news.shtml |date=26 April 2012 }}, Tideswell Male Voice Choir website, Retrieved 1 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Currie participated in an [[Oxford Union]] debate, saying she opposed [[feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cSrX2FJ-Q8|title = We Are Not All Feminists {{!}} Edwina Currie {{!}} Oxford Union|date = 1 May 2013|accessdate = 15 May 2015|website = YouTube|publisher = Google|last = OxfordUnion|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eric Waldram Kemp''', [[Fellow of the Royal Historical Society|FRHistS]] (27 April 1915 – 28 November 2009) was a [[Church of England]] bishop. He was the [[Bishop of Chichester]] from 1974 to 2001. He was one of the leading [[Anglo-Catholics]] of his generation and one of the most influential figures in the Church of England in the last quarter of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name = "Shy But Not Retiring"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Kemp was educated at [[Sir John Nelthorpe School|Brigg Grammar School]] and [[Exeter College, Oxford]], graduating with the degrees of [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1936, [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] in 1940, [[Bachelor of Divinity]] in 1944 and [[Doctor of Divinity]] in 1961. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Historical Society]] in 1951 and received an honorary [[Doctor of Letters|DLitt]] from the [[University of Sussex]].

==Ministry==
Kemp trained for ordination at [[St Stephen's House, Oxford]] from 1936 to 1939 where he later chaired the House Council.  He was ordained deacon in 1939 and priest in 1940. He served as assistant curate of St Luke's Church in [[Newtown, Hampshire|Newtown]] from 1939 to 1941. He moved back to [[Oxford]], where he remained for almost 31 years, first as Priest Librarian of [[Pusey House, Oxford]] (1941–1946) and Chaplain of [[Christ Church, Oxford]] (1943–1946) and then as Fellow, Tutor and Chaplain of [[Exeter College, Oxford]] from 1946 to 1969. He was Dean of [[Worcester Cathedral|Worcester]] from 1969 to 1974 and [[Bishop of Chichester]] from 1974 to 2001. He was consecrated bishop before the introduction of a mandatory retirement age and was able to continue in the post for as long as he chose. As a result, on his retirement he was one of the oldest and one of the longest-serving diocesan bishops in [[Church of England]] history. He had also held subsidiary appointments as [[Chaplain to the Queen]] (1967–1969) and Canon and Prebendary of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1952–2001). In April 1998 he was appointed Chanoine d'Honneur (Canon of Honour) of [[Chartres Cathedral]]. Following his retirement he was made Bishop Emeritus of Chichester.

==Family==

Kemp's father-in-law, [[Kenneth E. Kirk]], was [[Regius Professor of Moral and Pastoral Theology]] in the [[University of Oxford]] and [[Bishop of Oxford]]. Kemp wrote a book about Kirk&lt;ref&gt;''The Life and Letters of Kenneth Escott Kirk, Bishop of Oxford, 1937-1954''. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2001 presented his letters and papers to [[Lambeth Palace|Lambeth Palace Library]]. He and his wife Patricia had five children.  One of his daughters, Alice Kemp, has been ordained a Church of England Priest in the Diocese of Bristol.&lt;ref name="The Diocese of Bristol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.anglican.org/wordpress/?p=2532|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720120257/http://www.bristol.anglican.org/wordpress/?p=2532|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-20|title=The Diocese of Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

Kemp was one of the leading scholars of ecclesiastical law and a participant in conversations between the [[Church of England]] and the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain]].  He was a former member of the [[Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=52828|page=2231|date=10 February 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1998 a volume of essays on English Canon Law was published in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;''English Canon Law: essays in honour of Bishop Eric Kemp''; edited by Norman Doe, Mark Hill, Robert Ombres. Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1998 {{ISBN|0-7083-1478-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had special concern for [[Homelessness|homeless people]] and people living with [[AIDS|HIV and Aids]] and was a supporter of the campaign to save the [[French Convalescent Home, Brighton|French Convalescent Home]] in [[Brighton]]. In 1994 he became President of the [[National Liberal Club]].

He was one of only four bishops in the United Kingdom who declined to sign the [[Cambridge Accord]], affirming the [[human rights]] of [[homosexuals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.changingattitude.org/cambridge_accord.htm       |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011023003245/http://www.changingattitude.org/cambridge_accord.htm
|archivedate=23 October 2001 |title=The Cambridge Accord|publisher=[[Changing Attitude]]|year=2001–2006|accessdate=21 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He encouraged women to serve in the permanent diaconate in his diocese but was an opponent of the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican communion|ordination of women to the priesthood]] and women priests were not licensed in the [[Diocese of Chichester]] during his episcopate. The first woman to be licensed in the diocese, following the appointment of Kemp's successor, [[John William Hind]], was the Reverend Pat Sinton who was licensed as priest-in-charge of St Mary's Shipley  in November 2001. In Kemp's time women were able to work within the diocese through the approval of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''Globes''''' ({{lang-he|גלובס}}) is a [[Hebrew-language]] daily evening financial newspaper, the largest and the oldest of its kind in Israel. Globes was founded in the early 1980s and published in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]. It deals with economic issues and news from the Israeli and international business worlds. The color of the paper is pink, inspired by the British ''[[Financial Times]]''.

''Globes'' was one of the first Israeli dailies to publish its contents on the World Wide Web, dating back to April 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=64899|title=The Man Who Said Yes to the Internet|last=Yaakobson|first=Dror|date=16 March 1998|website=Globes|language=Hebrew|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to TGI 2017 media survey ''Globes''′ market share is 4.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.globes.co.il/en/article-tgi-survey-weekend-israel-hayom-overtakes-yedioth-ahronoth-1001198125|title= TGI survey: Weekend "Israel Hayom" overtakes "Yedioth"|author=Yonatan Kitain |date= 20 July 2017|work= |publisher= Globes |accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main competitors in printed media are ''[[TheMarker]]'' of the [[Haaretz]] group and ''[[Calcalist]]'' published by [[Yedioth Ahronoth]] Group. 

==History==
The daily paper founded by Haim Bar-On, the publisher of the newspaper, on the basis of a small, [[Haifa]]-based financial newspaper, in partnership with businessman Eliezer Fishman.

Following the success of ''Globes'', it had a competitor in the form of ''Telegraph'', which had a lower subscription price and was also printed on Saturday. ''Telegraph'' was closed after several years. A few years later, the Schocken Media Network published ''[[TheMarker]]'' economic newspaper as a competitor to ''Globes''.

The chief editor of ''Globes'' is Naama Sikuler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globes.co.il/en/article-naama-sikuler-appointed-globes-editor-1001198230|title=Naama Sikuler appointed "Globes" editor|last=|first=|date=23 July 2017|work=Globes|access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the regular contributors to the newspaper are Yoav Karni, Tal Schneider, Eli Tsipori, Matti Golan, Stella Korin-Lieber, and Dror Foer.

'''Hamza ibn ‘Alī ibn Aḥmad''' (985- c. 1021)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hamzah-ibn-Ali Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; (''Hamze Pesare Ali'', literally ''Hamze Son of Ali'' ; {{lang-fa|حمزه پسر علی}}, (Arabic: حمزة بن علي بن أحمد) was an 11th-century [[Ismaili]] and founding leader of the [[Druze]]. He was born in [[Zozan]] in [[Greater Khorasan]] in [[Samanid dynasty|Samanid-ruled Persia]] (modern Khaf, [[Razavi Khorasan Province]], [[Iran]]).

Hamza is considered the founder of the [[Druze]] and the primary author of the Druze manuscripts.

==Life==
After spending the first twenty years of his life in Samanid-ruled Persia, Hamza emigrated to Egypt and became known in the Fatimid Government as ''Hamza al-Fātimī'' "Hamza the Fatimid". He arrived in [[Cairo]] (modern [[Egypt]]) just as the [[Fatimid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Hakim bi Amr Allah|Al-Ḥākim]] built the [[House of Knowledge]], which became one of the main cultural centers of the Fatimid state.&lt;ref name=hamza&gt;[http://www.druze.com/education/DruzeLuminariesHamza_EnglishLevel3.pdf Hamza Ibn Ali From Book one of the Tawheed Faith By the American Druze Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107225013/http://www.druze.com/education/DruzeLuminariesHamza_EnglishLevel3.pdf |date=2007-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a very short period of time, Hamza became a close associate of al-Ḥākim and the Caliph appointed him Head of Letters and Correspondence.

Hamza took as his headquarters the Raydan Mosque, which was located outside the walls of Cairo. This mosque became the center where Hamza organized a new missionary movement. In May 1017, al-Ḥākim issued a decree naming Hamza the [[imām]] of "the Monotheists" (''al-Muwahhidūn'') immediately after declaring the beginning of the [[Divine call]]. Hamza demonstrated brilliant leadership for four years under al-Ḥākim’s direction.&lt;ref name=hamza/&gt;

Al-Ḥākim granted Hamza the freedom to preach this new reformist doctrine openly. Public resistance to Hamza's teachings increased as he spoke against corruption, [[polygamy]], remarriage of divorcees and other social customs as well as his theological disputes with other prominent Ismaeli leaders.&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{Citation

==Hamza and ad-Darazī==
During this external resistance, an internal rivalry arose between Hamza and one of his subordinates, [[Muhammad ibn Ismail ad-Darazi|ad-Darazī]]. Ad-Darazī deviated from the essence of the movement’s message and falsified the writings of Hamza to present al-Ḥākim as divine.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

Ad-Darazī had hoped that al-Ḥākim would favor him over Hamza, but instead there was public opposition to his teachings. Ad-Darazī then redirected the public’s resistance by declaring that he had acted on Hamza's instructions. Consequently, instead of attacking ad-Darazī, the crowds turned against Hamza and his associates, who were at Ridyan Mosque at the time.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; Although al-Ḥākim executed ad-Darazī for heresy and repudiated his teachings, many years later observers  attributed the Druze doctrine to ad-Darazī and do not mention Hamza at all. After the execution of ad-Darazī and his collaborators, Hamza continued his preaching activities for two more years.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

Few medieval chroniclers of the time not only failed to make the distinction between Druzes and Darazīs but attributed ad-Darazī’s doctrine to the followers of Hamza and argued that Hakim supported ad-Darazī’s ideas. Other historians have reported that it was Hamza who was subordinate to ad-Darazī, and still others have referred to Hamza and Darazi as the same person: Hamza ad-Darazī. As a consequence, the name “Druze” became synonymous with the reform movement.

Despite the ironic and misleading origins of the sect’s name, the title “Druze” never occurs in the Druze manuscripts of the 11th century. After the execution of Darazi and his collaborators, Hamza continued his preaching activities for two more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Many modern scholars have written that Hamza's and ad-Darazī's ideology was the same, which is preaching the literal divinity of al-Ḥākim,&lt;ref&gt;Minorities in the Middle East: A History of Struggle and Self-expression - Page 95 by Mordechai Nisan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Occultation==
During the same year that [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Ḥākim]] disappeared in 1021, Hamza went into retreat and delegated the third leading figure, ''Baha'ud-Dīn as-Samuqī'' ("[[Al-Muqtana Baha'uddin|al-Muqtana Baha’ud-Dīn]]") to continue the missionary movement.&lt;ref name=hamza/&gt; [[Al-Muqtana Baha'uddin|Baha’ud-Dīn]] continued public preaching with the approval of Hamza, who was in a disclosed location known only to [[Al-Muqtana Baha'uddin|Baha’ud-Dīn]] and few other missionaries. Preaching was halted after the [[Druze]] sect was closed in 1043 by [[Al-Muqtana Baha'uddin|Baha’ud-Dīn]].&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

'''Ifá''' is a religion and system of [[divination]] and refers to the verses of the literary corpus known as the ''Odu Ifá''. [[Orunmila]] is identified as the Grand Priest, as he is who revealed divinity and prophecy to the world. [[Babalawo]]s or [[Iyanifa]]s use either the divining chain known as ''[[Opele]]'', or the sacred palm or kola nuts called ''Ikin'', on the wooden divination tray called ''[[Opon Ifá]]''.

Ifá is practiced throughout the [[Americas]], [[West Africa]], and the [[Canary Islands]], in the form of a complex religious system, and plays a critical role in the traditions of [[Santería]], [[Candomblé]], [[Palo (religion)|Palo]], [[Umbanda]], [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]], and other [[Afro-American religion|Afro-American faiths]], as well as in some [[traditional African religions]].

==History==
The 16 principle system seems to have its earliest history in [[West Africa]]. Each [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]]-speaking ethnic group has its own myths of origin; [[Yoruba religion]] suggests that it was founded by [[Orunmila]] in [[Ife|Ilé-Ifẹ̀]] when he initiated himself and then he initiated his students, ''Akoda'' and ''Aseda''. Other myths suggest that it was brought to Ilé-Ifẹ̀ by ''Setiu'', a [[Nupe people|Nupe]] man who settled in Ilé-Ifẹ̀. According to the book ''The History of the Yorubas from the Earliest of Times to the British Protectorate'' (1921) by Nigerian historian [[Samuel Johnson (Nigerian historian)|Samuel Johnson]] and [[Obadiah Johnson]], it was Arugba, the mother of Onibogi, the 8th Alaafin of Oyo who introduced Oyo to Ifá in the late 1400s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Yorubas from the Earliest of Times to the Beginning of the British Protectorate|last=Johnson|first=Samuel|publisher=Nigeria Bookshops|year=1921|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She initiated the Alado of Ato and conferred on him the rites to initiate others. The Alado, in turn, initiated the priests of Oyo and that was how Ifá came to be in the Oyo empire.  [[Odinani]] suggests that Dahomey Kings noted that the system of Afá was brought by a diviner known as ''Gogo'' from eastern Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://Mamiwata.com/afa/afa.html|title = Afa in the African Diaspora|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orunmila came to establish an oral literary corpus incorporating stories and experiences of priests and their clients along with the results. This odu corpus emerges as the leading documentation on the Ifá tradition to become a historical legacy.

==Yoruba canon==
In [[Yorubaland]], divination gives priests unreserved access to the teachings of Orunmila. [[Eshu]] is the one said to lend [[Ase (Yoruba)|ashe]] to the oracle during provision of direction and or clarification of counsel. Eshu is also the one that holds the keys to ones ire, thus acts as Oluwinni (ones Creditor), he can grant ire or remove it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ogbeogunda.alawoye.com ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925144243/http://www.ogbeogunda.alawoye.com/ |date=September 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ifá divination rites provide an avenue of communication to the [[Spirit|spiritual realm]] and the intent of ones [[destiny]].

==Igbo canon==
In [[Igboland]], Ifá is known as '''Afá''', and is performed by specialists called ''Dibia''. The Dibia is considered a doctor and specializes in the use of herbs for healing and transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://umunumo.com/igbomedicine.html|title = Igbo Medicine|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ewe canon==
Among the [[Ewe people]] of southern [[Togo]] and southeast [[Ghana]], Ifá is known as '''Afá''', where the [[West African Vodun|Vodun]] spirits come through and speak. In many of their Egbes, it is ''Alaundje'' who is honored as the first ''Bokono'' to have been taught how to divine the destiny of humans using the holy system of Afá.
The ''Amengansi'' are the living oracles who are higher than a bokono. A priest who is not a bokono is known as ''Hounan'', similar to [[Houngan]], a male priest in [[Haitian Vodou]], a derivative religion of [[West African Vodun|Vodun]], the religion of the Ewe.

==Odù Ifá==
[[File:Jogo de Ikin Orossi.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Divination tray]]
There are sixteen major books in Odu Ifá&lt;ref&gt;[http://alawoye.com/Ifa_Orunmila_%3A_Alawoye/Ifa_Book_News_%26_Reviews/Ifa_Book_News_%26_Reviews.html Sixteen major 'books in Odù Ifá] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702201156/http://alawoye.com/Ifa_Orunmila_%3A_Alawoye/Ifa_Book_News_%26_Reviews/Ifa_Book_News_%26_Reviews.html |date=July 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; literary corpus. When combined there are total of 256 Odu (a collection of sixteen, each of which has sixteen alternatives ⇔ 16^2, or 4^4) believed to reference all situations, circumstances, actions and consequences in life based on the uncountable ese (poetic tutorials) relative to the 256 Odu coding. These form the basis of traditional Yoruba spiritual knowledge and are the foundation of all Yoruba divination systems. Ifá proverbs, stories, and poetry are not written down but passed down orally from one ''babalawo'' to another.

==International recognition==
The Ifá Divination system was added in 2005 by [[UNESCO]] to its list of the "[[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/ifa-divination-system-00146|title = Ifa Divination System|date = |accessdate = 5 July 2017|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islam in Oceania''' refers to [[Islam]] and [[Muslims]] in [[Oceania]]. By current estimates, there are 620,156 Muslims in Oceania, 476,600 in [[Australia]], 48,151 in [[New Zealand]], 52,520 in [[Fiji]], 6,352 in New Caledonia, 2,200 in [[Papua New Guinea]], 360 in Solomon Islands, 221 in [[Vanuatu]], 110 in [[Tonga]] and tiny numbers in [[Kiribati]] and [[Samoa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimpopulation.com/Oceania/ Muslim Population&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2007 article in ''Pacific Magazine'', entitled 'Green Moon Rising', Islam has seen a substantial increase in adherents amongst the peoples of [[Vanuatu]], [[Fiji]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[New Caledonia]]. There have been thousands of indigenous converts to Islam in [[Melanesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificmagazine.net/issue/2007/06/29/green-moon-rising Green moon rising] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010082524/http://www.pacificmagazine.net/issue/2007/06/29/green-moon-rising |date=2007-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://intellibriefs.blogspot.com/2007/08/pacific-spread-of-islam-in-melanesia.html Pacific: The spread of Islam in Melanesia]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also approximately 400 Muslims in [[Palau]], whose government recently allowed [[Uighur detainees in Guantanamo|a few]] [[Uyghurs]] detained in [[Guantanamo Bay]] to settle in the island nation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h0PvMT3xGXLwI-2KwkOThMJToprwD9AK6D1O0 Lawyers: Uighurs agree to go to Palau]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Islam by country}}

==History==
Islam has been in some parts of Oceania for at least 400 years (since the 17th century). When the people of [[New Guinea]] traded with China and the Malay empire, in the early 17th century, the presence of Islam was felt in Oceania for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/3028825.stm BBC NEWS | Asia-Pacific | Country profiles | Timeline: Papua New Guinea&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other parts of Oceania did not feel the presence of Islam until the 19th century. For instance, the first Muslims in [[Fiji]] came when Muslim migrants came on a ship bringing indentured labourers to Fiji in 1879. Muslims consisted of 22% of the boarders on ''[[Leonidas (ship)|Leonidas]]'', which was the first such ship.

{{Islam}}
'''Islamic culture''' is a term primarily used in [[secular]] [[academia]] to describe the cultural practices common to historically Islamic people—i.e., the culture of the [[Islamicate]]. The early forms of [[Muslim]] culture were predominantly [[Arab]]. With the rapid expansion of the [[Caliphate|Islamic empire]]s, Muslim culture has influenced and assimilated much from the [[Persian culture|Persia]]n, [[Caucasus|Caucasian]], [[Bangladesh]]i, [[Turkic people|Turkic]], [[Mongol]], [[Indian culture|India]]n, [[Malay people|Malay]], [[Somali people|Somali]], [[Berber people|Berber]], [[Egyptian culture|Egyptian]], [[Indonesia]]n, and [[Moro people|Moro]] cultures.

Islamic culture generally includes all the practices which have developed around the religion of [[Islam]], including Qur'anic ones such as prayer ([[salat]]) and non-Qur'anic such as [[divisions of the world in Islam]]. It includes the [[Baul]] tradition of [[Bengal]]. There are variations in the application of Islamic beliefs in different cultures and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21577045-new-survey-global-muslim-opinion-dont-expect-consistency-minds-unmade|title=Minds unmade|publisher=|via=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language and literature==
{{Main|Islamic literature}}

Muslim Culture/History

Early Muslim literature is in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as that was the language of [[Muhammad]]'s communities in [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. As the early history of the Muslim community was focused on establishing the religion of Islam, its literary output was religious in character. See the articles on [[Qur'an]], [[Hadith]], and [[Prophetic biography|Sirah]], which formed the earliest literature of the Muslim community.
[[File:Muslim population map 2009.png|thumb|250px|A map of Muslim populations by numbers, ([[Pew Research Center]], 2009).|left]]
With the establishment of the [[Umayyad]] empire, secular Muslim literature developed.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} See ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''. While having no religious content, this secular literature was spread by the Arabs all over their empires, and so became part of a widespread culture.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
[[File:Islam percent population in each nation World Map Muslim data by Pew Research.svg|thumb|262px|World Muslim population by percentage ([[Pew Research Center]], 2014).|left]] 
This is only one example of a vast heritage of literature and poetry works that were composed in Arabic besides enormous numbers of texts that dealt with theology, philosophy, mysticism, the sciences, whereby the Arabic language was the lingua franca of the Muslim world for over seven centuries till the rise of the Ottoman Empire.

===Persian===
{{Main|Persian literature}}

By the time of the Abbasid empire, [[Persian language|Persian]] had become the second language of [[Muslim World]]. Much of the most famous Muslim literature was written in Persian, from [[Rumi]] in [[Anatolia]], to [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]] in the [[Caucasus]], to [[Jami]] in [[Samarkand]] and [[Amir Khusrow]] in [[Delhi]].

===Turkish===
{{Main|Turkish literature}}

From the 11th century, there was a growing body of Islamic literature in the [[Turkic languages]]. However, for centuries to come the official language in Turkish-speaking areas would remain Persian. In Anatolia, with the advent of the Seljuks, the practise and usage of Persian in the region would be strongly revived. A branch of the [[Seljuks]], the [[Sultanate of Rum]], took Russian language, art and letters to Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;Sigfried J. de Laet. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PvlthkbFU1UC&amp;pg=PA734 ''History of Humanity: From the seventh to the sixteenth century''] UNESCO, 1994. {{ISBN|9231028138}} p 734&lt;/ref&gt; They adopted Persian language as the [[official language]] of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Ga ́bor A ́goston, Bruce Alan Masters. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&amp;pg=PA322 ''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire''] Infobase Publishing, 1 jan. 2009 {{ISBN|1438110251}} p 322&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], which can "roughly" be seen as their eventual successors, took this tradition over. Persian was the official court language of the empire, and for some time, the official language of the empire,&lt;ref&gt;Doris Wastl-Walter. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6gsm72h9u_IC&amp;pg=PA409''The Ashgate Research Companion to Border Studies''] Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2011 {{ISBN|0754674061}} p 409&lt;/ref&gt; though the lingua franca amongst common people from the 15th/16th century would become Turkish as well as having laid an active "foundation" for the Turkic language as early as the 4th century (see [[Turkification]]). After a period of several centuries, [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] (which was highly Arabo-Persianised itself) had developed towards a fully accepted language of literature, which was even able to satisfy the demands of a scientific presentation.&lt;ref name="Bertold Spuler p 69"&gt;Bertold Spuler. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rD1vvympVtsC&amp;pg=PA68 ''Persian Historiography &amp; Geography''] Pustaka Nasional Pte Ltd {{ISBN|9971774887}} p 69&lt;/ref&gt; However, the number of Persian and Arabic loanwords contained in those works increased at times up to 88%.&lt;ref name="Bertold Spuler p 69"/&gt; However, Turkish was proclaimed the official language of the [[Karamanids]] in the 17th century, though it didn't manage to become the official language in a wider area or larger empire until the advent of the Ottomans. With the establishment of the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] (a highly Arabo-Persianised version of Oghuz Turkic) grew in importance in both poetry and prose becoming, by the beginning of the 18th century, the official language of the Empire. Unlike India, where Persian remained the official and principal literary language of both Muslim and Hindu states until the 19th century.

===Indo-Islamic===
{{Main|Bengali literature|Urdu literature|Indo-Persian culture}}
[[File:Taj Mahal Sunset Edit1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra, India]], is one of the finest example of Indo-Islamic culture and architecture.]]
For a thousand years, India was a centre for Persian-Arabic Islamic literature. More Persian literature was produced in India than in the Iranian world. As late as the 20th century, [[Allama Iqbal]] chose Persian for some of his major poetic works.

In [[Bengal]], the [[Baul]] tradition of mystic music and poetry merged [[Sufism]] with many local images.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The most prominent poets were [[Hason Raja]] and [[Lalon Shah]].

During the early 14th century, the liberal poet [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] espoused intense spiritual rebellion against oppression, fascism and religious fundamentalism; and also wrote a highly acclaimed collection of Bengali [[ghazal]]s. ''[[Sultana's Dream]]'' by [[Begum Rokeya]], an [[Islamic feminist]], is one earliest works of [[feminist science fiction]].

==Art==

[[File:Behzad advice ascetic.jpg|thumb|right|225px|"Advice of the Ascetic", a 16th-century [[Persian miniature]]]]

Public [[Islamic art]] is traditionally non-representational, except for the widespread use of plant forms, usually in varieties of the spiralling [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]. These are often combined with [[Islamic calligraphy]], [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] in styles that are typically found in a wide variety of media, from small objects in ceramic or metalwork to large decorative schemes in tiling on the outside and inside of large buildings, including [[mosques]]. However, there is a long tradition in [[Islamic art]] of the depiction of human and animal figures, especially in painting and small anonymous [[relief]] figures as part of a decorative scheme. Almost all [[Persian miniature]]s (as opposed to decorative [[Ottoman illumination|illuminations]]) include figures, often in large numbers, as do their equivalents in Arab, Mughal and [[Ottoman miniature]]s.  But miniatures in books or [[muraqqa]] albums were private works owned by the elite.  Larger figures in [[monumental sculpture]] are exceptionally rare until recent times, and [[portrait]]ure showing realistic representations of individuals (and animals) did not develop until the late 16th century in miniature painting, especially [[Mughal miniature]]s.  Manuscripts of the Qur'an and other sacred texts have always been strictly kept free of such figures, but there is a long tradition of the [[depiction of Muhammad]] and other religious figures in books of history and poetry; since the 20th century Muhammad has mostly been shown as though wearing a veil hiding his face, and many earlier miniatures were overpainted to use this convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sheila R. Canby|title=Islamic Art in Detail|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tA9Uuy2cSIcC&amp;pg=PA26|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02390-1|pages=26–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depiction of animate beings===
Some consider that Islam prohibits the depiction of animate beings in paintings and drawings. One possible reason for this is that it removes the risk of [[idolatry|idol worship]]. Islam teaches that Allah alone should be worshipped; it also holds that banning pictures of Muhammad, the Prophets, and animate beings reduces the risk that they will be worshipped in his place.

However, some others argue that the depiction of animated beings is permissible if the art was not meant to be worshipped, and the creator did not intend to rival God (or intended any heresy) in the creation. This is due to the hadith that mentioned the Prophet had once asked his wife to move a picture of two birds in the room in which he prays somewhere else. However, he didn't ask the picture to be destroyed. This, along with other hadiths, made some believe that pictures of animated beings that are not worshipped or to be considered heresy, is permissible (although using it as a form of luxury, such as hanging them on a wall is often discouraged in some branches of Islam).
One exemption that maybe mentioned is the case of the Al Buraq, white animal smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey which brought Mohammed from Masjid-el-Haram in Mecca to Masjid-el-Aqsa in Jerusalem in the Journey by Night (V. 53.12), Isra 17:1a).

===Calligraphy===
{{Main|Islamic calligraphy}}
Forbidden to paint living things and taught to revere the [[Qur'an]], Islamic artists developed [[Arabic calligraphy]] into an art form. Calligraphers have long drawn from the Qur'an or proverbs as art, using the flowing [[Arabic language]] to express the beauty they perceive in the verses of Qur'an.

===Elements of Islamic style===
Islamic architecture may be identified with the following design elements, which were inherited from the first mosque built by [[Muhammad]] in [[Medina]], as well as from other pre-Islamic features adapted from churches and synagogues.
*Large courtyards often merged with a central prayer hall (originally a feature of the [[Masjid al-Nabawi]]).
*[[Minaret]]s or towers (which were originally used as torch-lit watchtowers for example in the [[Great Mosque of Damascus]]; hence the derivation of the word from the Arabic ''nur'', meaning "light"). The oldest standing minaret in the world is the minaret of the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] (in [[Tunisia]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DBqId4J_sIAC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=oldest+surviving+minaret+kairouan&amp;lr=&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=oldest%20surviving%20minaret%20kairouan&amp;f=false |title=Titus Burckhardt, '&amp;#39;Art of Islam, Language and Meaning : Commemorative Edition'&amp;#39;.

*A [[mihrab]] or niche on an inside wall indicating the direction to [[Mecca]]. This may have been derived from previous uses of niches for the setting of the [[torah]] scrolls in [[Jewish]] synagogues or ''Mehrab'' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: مِهراب) of Persian [[Mitraism]] culture or the [[:wikt:haikal]] of [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] churches.
*Domes (the earliest Islamic use of which was in the 8th-century mosque of Medina).
*Use of [[iwan]]s to intermediate between different sections.
*Use of geometric shapes and repetitive art ([[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]).
*Use of decorative [[Arabic calligraphy]].
*Use of symmetry.
*Ablution fountains.
*Use of bright colour.
*Focus on the interior space of a building rather than the exterior.

==Theatre==

Whilst theatre is permitted by Islam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia |last=Meri |first=Josef W. |author2=Bacharach, Jere L. |year=2006 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=0-415-96691-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=H-k9oc9xsuAC&amp;pg=PA807&amp;dq=islam%2Btheatre%2Bprophet |page=807 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam does not allow for any performances to depict [[Allah]], [[Muhammad]], his companions, the [[angels]] or matters detailed in the religion that are unseen.

The most popular forms of [[theatre]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] were [[puppet]] theatre (which included hand puppets, [[shadow play]]s and [[marionette]] productions) and live [[passion play]]s known as ''ta'ziya'', where actors re-enact episodes from [[Muslim history]]. In particular, [[Shia Islam]]ic [[Play (theatre)|plays]] revolved around the ''[[Shahid|shaheed]]'' (martyrdom) of [[Ali]]'s sons [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali]]. Live secular plays were known as ''akhraja'', recorded in medieval ''[[Adab (behavior)|adab]]'' literature, though they were less common than puppetry and ''[[ta'zieh]]'' theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Moreh |first=Shmuel |contribution=Live Theatre in Medieval Islam |title=Studies in Islamic History and Civilization |editor-last=[[David Ayalon]] |editor-first=[[Moshe Sharon]] |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |year=1986 |isbn=965-264-014-X |pages=565–601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the oldest, and most enduring, forms of puppet theatre is the [[Wayang]] of [[Indonesia]].  Although it narrates primarily pre-Islamic legends, it is also an important stage for Islamic epics such as the adventures of Amir Hamzah (pictured).  Islamic Wayang is known as ''Wayang Sadat'' or ''Wayang Menak''.

[[Karagoz]], the Turkish Shadow Theatre has influenced puppetry widely in the region. It is thought to have passed from [[China]] by way of [[India]]. Later it was taken by the [[Mongols]] from the Chinese and transmitted to the Turkish peoples of Central Russia. Thus the art of Shadow Theatre was brought to [[Anatolia]] by the Turkish people emigrating from Central Asia. Other scholars claim that shadow theatre came to Anatolia in the 16th century from [[Egypt]]. The advocates of this view claim that when Yavuz Sultan Selim conquered Egypt in 1517, he saw shadow theatre performed during an extacy party put on in his honour. [[Selim I|Yavuz Sultan Selim]] was so impressed with it that he took the puppeteer back to his palace in Istanbul. There his 47-year-old son, later Sultan [[Suleyman the Magnificent]], developed an interest in the plays and watched them a great deal. Thus shadow theatre found its way into the Ottoman palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Tradition Folk The Site by Hayali Mustafa Mutlu&lt;/ref&gt;

In other areas the style of shadow puppetry known as ''khayal al-zill'' – an intentionally metaphorical term whose meaning is best translated as ‘shadows of the imagination’ or ‘shadow of fancy' survives. This is a shadow play with live music ..”the accompaniment of drums, tambourines and flutes...also...“special effects” – smoke, fire, thunder, rattles, squeaks, thumps, and whatever else might elicit a laugh or a shudder from his audience"&lt;ref&gt;Article Saudi Aramco World 1999/John Feeney&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iran]] puppets are known to have existed much earlier than 1000, but initially only glove and string puppets were popular in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Theatre in Iran: Willem Floor:{{ISBN|0-934211-29-9}}: Mage 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Other genres of puppetry emerged during the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] era (18th–19th century) as influences from Turkey spread to the region. ''Kheimeh Shab-Bazi'' is a Persian traditional puppet show which is performed in a small chamber by a musical performer and a [[storytelling|storyteller]] called a ''morshed'' or ''naghal''. These shows often take place alongside storytelling in traditional tea and coffee-houses (''Ghahve-Khave''). The dialogue takes place between the morshed and the puppets. Puppetry remains very popular in Iran, the touring opera [[Rostam and Sohrab (opera)|Rostam and Sohrab puppet opera]] being a recent  example.

The [[Royal Opera House Muscat|Royal Opera House]] in [[Muscat, Oman]]. It is considered to be the first opera house linking Islamic culture with classical music.

==Dance==
Many forms of dancing arts are practised in Muslim cultures, both in religious&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam |last=Glassé |first=Cyril |year=2001 |publisher=Rowman Altamira |isbn=0-7591-0190-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=focLrox-frUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA403&amp;dq=islam%2Bdance%2Bprohibited%2Bmen |page=403 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and secular contexts (such as folk and tribal dances, court dances, dances of celebration during weddings and festivals, belly dancing, ''etc.'').

Some scholars of Islamic ''[[fiqh]]'' pronounced gender based rulings on dance, making it permissible for women within a female only environment, as is often performed at celebrations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Muslim Women Sing: Hausa Popular Song |last=Mack |first=Beverly B. |year=2004 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-21729-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nIaK44Dz99kC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=islam%2Bdance%2Bgender |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but discouraging men to engage in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Embodiment, Morality, and Medicine |last=Cahill |first=Lisa Sowle |author2=Farley, Margaret A. |year=1995 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-7923-3342-X |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GBhgsabD6WgC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=islam%2Bdance%2Bprohibited%2Bmen |page=43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other classical authorities including [[Al-Ghazzali]] and [[Al-Nawawi]] allow it without this distinction, but criticised dancing which is "languid" or excites carnal lusts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Alchemy of Happiness ''(Chapter 5: Concerning Music and Dancing as Aids to the Religious Life)'' |author=Al-Ghazzali |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/tah/tah09.htm}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reliance of the Traveller (''Umdat ul-Salik''); Section r40.4 on "Dancing", p. 794|url=https://abudaniyal.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/reliance2_complete.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the religious orders (''[[tariqa]]'') which dominate traditional Muslim religious life practice ritualised forms of dance in the context of ''[[dhikr]]'' ceremonies. ''Dhikr'', "recollection" (of God) is a meditative form of worship different from ritual prayer where the seeker focuses all of his senses and thoughts on God in the hope of attaining ''maarifat'' (experiential knowledge of God) and triggering mystic states within him- or herself. ''Dhikr'' can be performed individually or with like-minded followers under the direction of a [[sheikh]], and can involve silent meditation or repetition and visualisation of sacred words such as the [[99 names of God]] or Quranic phrases, and may be done at rest or with rhythmic movements and controlling one's breath. Traditional Islamic orders have developed varied ''dhikr'' exercises including sometimes highly elaborate ritual dances accompanied by Sufi poetry and classical music.

[[Al-Ghazzali]] discussed the use of music and dancing in ''dhikr'' and the mystical states it induces in worshippers, as well as regulating the etiquette attached to these ceremonies, in his short treatise on Islamic spirituality ''[[The Alchemy of Happiness]]'' and in his highly influential work ''[[The Revival of the Religious Sciences]]''. Al-Ghazzali emphasized how the practices of music and dance are beneficial to religious seekers, as long as their hearts are pure before engaging in these practices.&lt;ref&gt;Ghazzālī, and Claud Field. The Alchemy of Happiness. Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable examples include the [[Mevlevi Order]] founded by [[Jalaluddin Rumi]], which was the main Sunni order of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empire, and its ''[[Sama (Sufism)|sama]]'' ritual (known in the West as "the [[whirling dervishes]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Whirling Dervishes |last=Friedlander|first=Shems |author2=Uzel, Nezih |year=1992 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=0-7914-1155-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mevlevi order, its rituals and Ottoman classical music has been banned in [[Turkey]] through much of the 20th century as part of the country's drive towards secular "modernisation", and the order's properties have been expropriated and the country's mosques put out of its control, which has radically diminished its influence in modern Turkey. In 2008, [[UNESCO]] confirmed the "[[Mevlevi Order|Mevlevi]] Sama Ceremony" of [[Turkey]] as one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/intangible-heritage/39eur_uk.htm The Mevlevi Sama Ceremony] [[UNESCO]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice is now regaining interest.

In [[Egypt]] and the [[Levant]], the Mevlevi form of ''sama'' is known as [[tannoura]] and has been adopted (with some modifications) by other Sufi orders as well.

The [[Chishti]] order, traditionally the dominant Islamic institution in [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the most ancient of the major Sufi orders, also practices forms of ''sama'' similar to the Mevlevis, as well as other forms of devotional dance such as ''[[dhamaal]]''. The order is strongly associated with the development of [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] classical music and semi-classical devotional genres such as ''[[qawwali]]'' through famed pioneer figures such as [[Amir Khusrow]]. The Chishti order remains one of the largest and strongest Muslim religious orders in the world by far, retaining a vast influence on the spirituality and culture of around 500 million Muslims living in the Indian subcontinent.

Other examples of devotional dance are found in the [[Maghreb]] where it is associated with [[gnawa]] music, as well as Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. The [[Naqshbandi]] order, predominant among [[Iran]]'s Sunni minority, is a notable exception in that they do not use music and dancing in the context of ''dhikr''.

In addition to these strictly religious forms of dance, colourful dancing processions traditionally take place in Muslim communities during weddings and public celebrations such as ''[[Mawlid]]'', ''[[Eid el-Adha]]'', and so on. Many Islamic cultures have also developed classical forms of dance in the context for instance of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Persian people|Persian]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] court cultures, as well as innumerable local folk and tribal dances (for instance amongst [[Bedouin]], [[Tuareg]] and [[Pashto]] peoples), and other forms of dance used for entertainment or sometimes healing such as belly dancing (principally associated with Egyptian culture).

Although ''tariqas'' and their rituals have been an omnipresent part of Muslim life for most of Islam's history and were largely responsible for the spread of Islam throughout the world, their following and influence has sharply declined since the late 19th century, having been vigorously opposed and combated in turns by the [[France|French]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial administrations and by Muslim modernists and secularists like [[Kemal Ataturk]], and in recent decades have been the target of vocal opposition by the fundamentalist [[Wahhabi]] sect promoted by [[Saudi Arabia]] (where most of the heritage associated with [[Sufism]] and ''tariqa'' was physically destroyed by the state in the 1930s). Wahhabi militant groups such as [[ISIS]] and the [[Taliban]] are repeatedly targeting ''dhikr'' ceremonies in terrorist attacks, notably in [[Egypt]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dawn.com/news/1045796&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dawn.com/news/1315839&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{Main|Muslim music}}
Many Muslims are very familiar to listening to music.
The classic heartland of [[Islam]] is [[Arabia]] as well as other parts of the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Central Asia]]. Because [[Islam]] is a multicultural religion, the musical expression of its adherents is diverse.

The [[Seljuk Turks]], a nomadic tribe that converted to Islam, conquered [[Anatolia]] (now [[Turkey]]), and held the [[Caliphate]] as the [[Ottoman Empire]], also had a strong influence on Islamic music. See [[Taksim (music)|Turkish classical music]].

Sub-Saharan [[Africa]], [[India]], and the [[Malay Archipelago]] also have large Muslim populations, but these areas have had less influence than the heartland on the various traditions of Islamic music.  For [[South India]], see: [[Mappila Songs]], [[Duff Muttu]].

All these regions were connected by trade long before the Islamic conquests of the 7th century and later, and it is likely that musical styles travelled the same routes as trade goods. However, lacking recordings, we can only speculate as to the pre-Islamic music of these areas. Islam must have had a great influence on music, as it united vast areas under the first caliphs, and facilitated trade between distant lands. Certainly the [[Sufi]]s, brotherhoods of Muslim [[mysticism|mystics]], spread their music far and wide.

See articles on [[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Eid ul-Adha]], [[Ashurah]] (see also [[Hosay]] and [[Tabuik]]), [[Mawlid]], [[Lailat al Miraj]] and [[Shab-e-baraat]].

==Marriage==
{{expand section|date=October 2016}}
{{Main|Islamic marriage}}

In Islam, marriage is a legal bond and [[social contract]] between a man and a woman as prompted by the [[Shari'a]].

==Family values==

In Islam, the role of the family is very important. There is also the belief that a lot can be learned from having three generations living under the same roof. By having household members treat and assist grandparents will strengthen the bond within the family, and within oneself.  Extended family also plays a crucial role.  In historic times in Islamic culture, families often lived near one another.  This is not necessarily true in our society today, as families may live farther away from each other due to demands in jobs and other commitments. Still, many Muslim families retain identities that are separate from the dominant culture while having [[Women in Trinidad and Tobago#Cultural Spaces and Islam|interconnected involvement]] within society.&lt;ref&gt;Baptiste, Jeanne. P. (2016). Gender practices and relations at the jamaat al muslimeen in trinidad. ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global, 1780310091. Retrieved from http://www.proquest.com/docview/1780310091&lt;/ref&gt; However, the idea of a close family bond is still present in Islamic culture even with these modern changes, and family is ultimately seen as a great source of help during times of conflict within an immediate family.

The '''L. Ron Hubbard House''', also known as the '''Original Founding Church of Scientology''', is a [[writer's house museum]] and former [[Church of Scientology|Scientology church]] located at 1812 19th Street NW in the [[Dupont Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. Public tours are given on a regular basis. The operating Founding Church is now located at 1424 16th Street for services, bookstore and classes. &lt;ref name="WCP"&gt;{{cite web| last=Banville | first=Jule | title=The L.

==History==
The row of buildings located at 1810 -1820 19th Street NW was designed by local architectural firm [[Waddy Butler Wood#Wood, Donn &amp; Deming|Wood, Donn, &amp; Deming]] for Arvine W. Johnston in 1904.&lt;ref name="HABS"&gt;{{cite web| last=Null | first=Druscilla J. | title=Architectural Data Form | work=[[Historic American Buildings Survey]] | publisher=National Park Service | date=1983-07-07 | url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/hhh.dc0390 | accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable owners of the home during the early 20th century included [[United States Senator]]s [[James K. Jones]]&lt;ref name="JKJ"&gt;{{cite web| last= | first= | title=Buys House in Washington | work=| publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''| date=1906-07-19 | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/254078402.html?dids=254078402:254078402&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Jul+19%2C+1906&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post++(1877-1954)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=14&amp;desc=BUYS+HOUSE+IN+WASHINGTON | accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Claude A.

Hubbard purchased the home in 1955, the same year he organized the Founding Church which met at 1826 R Street NW from July 21, 1955 until 1959.&lt;ref name="WCP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WAPO"&gt;{{cite web| last= | first= | title=News In Brief | work=| publisher=''Washington Post''| date=1995-10-28 | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/19435487.html?dids=19435487:19435487&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Oct+28%2C+1995&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C.06&amp;desc=NEWS+IN+BRIEF | accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building later served as the home of the Academy of Scientology, previously located at 1845 R Street NW, and known as The Academy of Religious Arts and Sciences.  Additional Scientology organizations once located at the L. Ron Hubbard House include the National Academy of American Psychology (NAAP).&lt;ref name=NAAP&gt;{{Cite journal |last=White |first=Alex Sandri |year=1969 |title=The Seeker's Guide to Groups and Societies |publisher=Aurea Publications |pages=36 |isbn= |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1963, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) ordered a raid against the Academy's 19th Street location, seizing more than 100 [[e-meters]] (electronic devices used by Scientologists) and 200 pieces of literature. The raid resulted in a [[lawsuit]] filed by the FDA against the Founding Church. In 1971, the Church and FDA reached a settlement which included a ruling that all e-meters bear a prominent warning label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States of America v.

After the Founding Church sold the property in the mid-1970s, it was once again used for residential purposes.  An organization called the Friends of L. Ron Hubbard repurchased the home in 2004.&lt;ref name="WCP"/&gt;

==Architecture==
The three-story L. Ron Hubbard House is an example of [[Mediterranean Revival Style architecture]], a design frequently used by [[Waddy Butler Wood]] and his associates. The building's exterior consists of cream-colored brick, accented with stone and wood trimming. Decorative features include a two-story bay window, red-tiled roof, and [[Flemish gable]].&lt;ref name="HABS"/&gt;

==Current usage==
The museum opened in 2007 following a year-long renovation to restore the building to its 1957 appearance. It contains a recreation of the Hubbard Communications Office and various literature describing Hubbard's early life. A tour of the museum is available by appointment only.&lt;ref name="WCP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orlando"&gt;{{cite web| last=Landers | first=Chris | title=Serious Business: Anonymous takes on Scientology (and doesn't afraid of anything) | work=| publisher=''[[Orlando Weekly]]''| date=2008-04-24 | url=http://www.orlandoweekly.com/features/story.asp?id=12304 | accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2014 [[property value]] of the L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15340">This is a complete list of the currently existing '''buildings created in the [[Kievan Rus]] before the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasions]]''' of the 1230s. The vast majority of these buildings are churches. Only three secular buildings survived from the period.

Most of the churches were completely rebuilt over the years and lost some of essential features of the Old Rus architecture. Some were destroyed in the 20th century and then replicas were built years later. These churches are included in the list. Churches which were destroyed and subsequently rebuilt without any attempts of scientific reconstruction (the [[Assumption Church of Virgin Pirogoshcha]] and the Saint Michael Cathedral of [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery]], both in [[Kiev]]) are not included.

The list is organized geographically, roughly corresponding to the main principalities of the Kievan Rus. Inside these divisions, the entries are sorted by the date of the first creation.

{{IAST|'''''Micchāmi Dukkaḍaṃ''''' (मिच्छामि दुक्कडम्)}} is an ancient Indian phrase, which is translated from [[Prakrit]] to literally mean "may all the evil that has been done be fruitless." &lt;ref name=cha&gt;Chapple. C.K. (2006) ''Jainism and Ecology: Nonviolence in the Web of Life'' Delhi:Motilal Banarasidas Publ. {{ISBN|978-81-208-2045-6}} p.46&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used to seek forgiveness and to mean, "If I have offended you in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, in thought, word or deed, then I seek your forgiveness."&lt;ref name=iex/&gt; 

It is used widely in [[Jainism|the Jain religion]] on the last day ([[Samvatsari]] or [[Kshamavani]]) of [[Paryushana]], the most important annual holy event of the Jain calendar.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/13/stories/2007091353590500.htm|title=Jains pray for peace, brotherhood |author=|date=2007-09-13|accessdate= 2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jyoga/&gt; As a matter of ritual, Jains greet their friends and relatives on this last day with ''Micchāmi Dukkaḍaṃ'', seeking their forgiveness. No private quarrel or dispute should be carried beyond this time. The importance of forgiveness in [[Jainism]] may be compared to the importance of [[Forgiveness|forgiveness in other religions]].

The phrase is also used by [[Jainism|Jains]] throughout the year when a person makes a mistake, or recollects making one in everyday life, or when asking for forgiveness in advance for inadvertent ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Śramana Bhagavān Mahāvira: pt. 1.

At the end of the festival [[Paryushana]], devotees request forgiveness for any offenses committed during the year by saying ‘Micchami Dukkadam’ or ‘Uttam Kshama’ meaning “If I have offended you in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, in thought, word or deed, then I seek your forgiveness.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.freepressjournal.in/webspecial/paryushana-2017-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-jain-festival-of-forgiveness/1123051|title=Paryushana 2017: All you need to know about the Jain festival of forgiveness {{!}} Free Press Journal|date=2017-08-17|work=Free Press Journal|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|}

==Practice==
''micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ'' is most commonly used on the last day (''[[Samvatsari]]'') of one of the most holy annual Jain events, [[Paryushana]]. After ''[[pratikramana]]'' (Jain prayer, literally meaning "introspection"), [[Jainism|Jains]] seek forgiveness from almost all the creatures of the world whom they may have harmed knowingly or unknowingly by uttering the phrase—''micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ''.&lt;ref name=iex&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Indian Express]]|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Request-for-Forgiveness/355457/|title=Request for Forgiveness|author=Preeti Srivastav|date=2008-08-31|accessdate=2009-11-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001054813/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Request-for-Forgiveness/355457/|archivedate=2012-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jainism: the world of conquerors, (Vol. 1)|author=Natubhai Shah|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|year=1998 |isbn=1-898723-30-3 |page=212 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EmVzvUzbwegC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=Michchhami+Dukkadam&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZoRfTrdWzdCtB4yixLUP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Michchhami%20Dukkadam&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paryushana]] frequently falls in August or September during [[Chaturmas|Cāturmāsa]], four months into the rainy season. This annual holy time for [[Jainism|Jains]] is reserved for prayers, meditation, introspection, penance, and fasting. Even the wandering monks temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst laymen, giving discourses and organizing scriptural recitations.&lt;ref name=jyoga/&gt;

Traditionally, letters were sent and telephone calls made to friends and relatives asking their forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, James (2003), Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics Part 10, Kessinger Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-7661-3682-3}} p.876&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The phrase ''michchāmi dukkaḍaṃ'' is also found in the ''Airyapathiki Sutra''.&lt;ref name=jyoga/&gt; It literally means — may all the evil that has been done be fruitless, and comes from the [[Prakrit]] language, a [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|middle Indo-Aryan language,]] closely linked with [[Pali]] and used abundantly in the Prakrit canon of [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name=cha/&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The [[Sanskrit]] version''(chayā)'' of the phrase is ''mithyā me duṣkṛitām'' meaning "may the evil of it be in vain".&lt;ref name=jyoga&gt;{{cite book |title=Jaina yoga: a survey of the mediaeval śrāvakācāras|author= R. Williams|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |year=1991|isbn=81-208-0775-8 |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLKcrIJ6oscC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=Michchhami+Dukkadam&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZoRfTrdWzdCtB4yixLUP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Michchhami%20Dukkadam&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply put "May my misdeeds be undone."&lt;br&gt;
''mithyā'' refers to 'being fruitless' or 'getting absolved of'. ''me'' refers to 'my'. ''duṣkṛitām'' refers to 'bad deeds'.

He was the first Hispanic U.S. Ambassador accredited to the [[Holy See]].

As ambassador, Díaz helped launch the Religion in Foreign Policy Working Group of the Secretary of State's Strategic Dialogue with Civil Society. The Working Group facilitates regular dialogue between the U.S. foreign policy establishment and religious leaders, scholars, and practitioners worldwide on strategies to build more effective partnerships on issues such as conflict prevention, humanitarian assistance and national security.&lt;ref name=resig /&gt;

On May 20, 2014, [[Loyola University Chicago]] announced that they intended to hire Díaz as a professor despite the University of Dayton harassment allegation. A spokesman for Loyola said in an email, "We have reviewed the allegations raised against Miguel Diaz and our offer to him stands." He became a professor at Loyola on July 1, 2014.&lt;ref name=LUC&gt;{{cite web|title=Loyola Chicago will hire ex-vatican ambassador despite harassment allegations|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/05/20/loyola-chicago-will-hire-ex-vatican-ambassador-despite-harassment-allegations#ixzz32ZXQuu9W|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Díaz was born in [[Havana, Cuba]], and he and his family departed for [[Spain]] when he was nine. Two years later, he immigrated to [[Florida]]. He comes from a modest background; his father worked as a waiter and his mother worked as a [[data entry clerk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/view.bg?&amp;articleid=1175580&amp;format=&amp;page=1&amp;listingType=politics Obama’s pick for Vatican ambassador described as devout scholar, leading theologian], [[Boston Herald]], May 29, 2009, AP{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Gorski [https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ixIUCIu6J6moGgKY8PaC6cUvkHbQD98EUBO00 Hispanic theologian chosen for Vatican ambassador] AP, May 27, 2009 {{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Díaz holds a B.A. from [[St. Thomas University (Florida)|St. Thomas University]] and an M.A. and a Ph.D. in Theology from the [[University of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-More-Key-Administration-Posts-5-27-2009/ | title=President Obama Announces More Key Administration Posts | publisher=The White House | accessdate=2009-06-05 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602123854/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-More-Key-Administration-Posts-5-27-2009/ | archivedate=2009-06-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Prior to his service as ambassador, he was a professor of theology at the [[College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University]] in [[Minnesota]]. Díaz is the co-editor of the book ''From the Heart of Our People: Explorations in Catholic Systematic Theology'' and author of ''On Being Human: U.S. Hispanic and Rahnerian Perspectives'', named "Best Book of the Year" by the [[Hispanic Theological Initiative]] at [[Princeton Theological Seminary]]. Díaz has taught religious studies and theology at [[Barry University]], the [[University of Dayton]] and the [[University of Notre Dame]]. From 2001 to 2003, he taught and served as academic dean at [[St. Vincent de Paul Regional Seminary]] in [[Boynton Beach, Florida]]. He is a board member of the [[Catholic Theological Society of America]] (CTSA) and past president of the [[Academy of Catholic Hispanic Theologians of the United States]] (ACHTUS).

Conservative news outlet [[Newsmax]] claimed that Díaz was rejected by the Vatican several times for being "insufficiently pro-life".&lt;ref&gt;Pentin, Edward. [https://web.archive.org/web/20090406111415/http://www.newsmax.com/insidecover/obama_vatican_picks/2009/04/02/199160.html Vatican Unhappy with Obama Ambassador Picks], Inside Cover, Newsmax.com, April 2, 2009, accessed March 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine said that the story was false.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Amy.

== Theology ==
Building on the work of Karl Rahner, Díaz has placed extensive emphasis on the role of the Trinity in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Espín|first1=Orlando|title=Building Bridges, Doing Justice: Constructing a Latino/a Ecumenical Theology|date=2009|publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=91–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with theologians such as Catherine LaCugna, Díaz argues that the life of God cannot be considered apart from history, but must be conceived as "for us, and for our salvation." In this vein, he has also asserted that in the contemporary American context, God can be seen vividly "in the face of migrants," who face the dangers of economic insecurity, violence, and social marginalization in search of a better life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Díaz|first1=Miguel|title=On Loving Strangers: Encountering the Mystery of God in the Face of Migrants|journal=Word and World|date=January 1, 2009|volume=29|issue=3|pages=234–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology of kinship |concepts}}

'''Milk kinship''', formed during nursing by a non-biological mother, was a form of fostering allegiance with fellow community members. This particular form of [[kinship]] did not exclude particular groups, such that [[Social class|class]] and other hierarchal systems did not matter in terms of milk kinship participation.

Traditionally speaking, this practice predates the [[early modern period]], though it became a widely used mechanism for developing alliances in many hierarchical societies during that time. Milk kinship used the practice of [[breast feeding]] by a [[wet nurse]] to feed a child either from the same community, or a neighbouring one. This wet nurse played the strategic role in forging relations between her family and the family of the child she was nursing, as well as their community.

== In Islamic societies ==
{{seealso|Rada (fiqh)}}

In the [[early modern period]], milk kinship was widely practiced in many Arab countries for both religious and strategic purposes. Like the Christian practice of [[godparent]]ing, milk kinship established a second family that could take responsibility for a child whose biological parents came to harm. "Milk kinship in Islam thus appears to be a culturally distinctive, but by no means unique, institutional form of adoptive {{nowrap|kinship."&lt;ref name="Parkes"&gt;Parkes, Peter, "Milk Kinship in Islam: Substance, Structure, History", ''[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soca.2005.13.issue-3/issuetoc Social Anthropology]'' 13&amp;nbsp;(3), pp. 307-329.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|308}}&lt;!--end nowrap:--&gt;}}

The childhood of the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]], illustrates the practice of traditional Arab milk kinship. In his early childhood, he was sent away to foster-parents amongst the [[Bedouin]]. By nursing him, [[Halimah bint Abdullah]]  became his "milk-mother." The rest of her family was drawn into the relationship as well: her husband al-Harith became Muhammad's "milk-father," and Muhammad was raised alongside their biological children as a "milk-brother".&lt;ref name="Parkes"/&gt;{{rp|309}} Due to milk kinship a man cannot marry
* His foster mother or other female foster ancestor
* His foster sister

== In Native American societies ==

When Crazy Horse was a baby, he nursed at the breast of every woman in the tribe. The Sioux raised their children that way. Every warrior called every woman in the tribe "Mother". Every older warrior, they called him "Grandfather". &lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite book | last = Moore | first = Henrietta L. | title = Feminism and anthropology | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | location = Hoboken | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780745667997 | oclc = 18259349 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|309}}

== Strategic reasons for milk kinship ==

"Colactation links two families of unequal status and creates a durable and intimate bond; it removes from 'clients' their outsider status but excludes them as marriage partners…it brings about a social relationship that is an alternative to kinship bonds based on blood."&lt;ref&gt;R. Ensel, "Colactation and fictive kinship as rites of incorporation and reversal in Morocco", ''Journal of North African Studies'' 23 (2002), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; People of different races and religions could be brought together strategically through the bonding of the milk mother and their milk ‘children’. 

===Lower social class===
Milk kinship was as relevant for peasants as ‘fostering’ or as ‘hosting’ other children, in that it secured the good will from their masters and their wives. As previously mentioned the milk women’s family is the ‘core range’ to the child she is nursing and they become milk kin, which may strategically be useful for the future if the child is from a higher class family, as the milk women’s children will become ‘milk-brothers’ and ‘milk-sisters.’ Thus peasant women would most often play the role of the ‘milk’ mother to her non-biological children, and they held an important role in maintaining the connection between herself and the master whose baby she is nursing. It is also important to note that it was also a practical way to assist families who were of a very ill mother or whose mother died in childbirth. This would have been helpful in many societies where, especially in times of war, if families perished, other members of society would end up co-parenting through the link of milk-kinship. 

===Higher social class===
[[File:Mignard Louis XIV as a child with his milk-sister.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Louis XIV of France]] as a child with his milk-sister [[Henrietta of England]] by circle of [[Pierre Mignard]], ca. 1646, [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]].]]
Noble offspring were often sent to milk kin fosterers that would foster them to maturity so that the children would be raised by their successive status subordinates. The purpose of this was for political importance to build milk kin as bodyguards. This was a major practice in the Hindu Kush society.&lt;ref name="Parkes"/&gt;{{rp|315}}

== Conflicting theories, ideas and myths ==

One particular theory mentioned by Peter Parkes is an Arab folk-analogy that breast milk is supposed to be “transformed male semen” that arises from Hertiers Somatic Scheme.&lt;ref name="Parkes"/&gt;{{rp|308}} There is no evidence that Arabs ever considered a mother's milk to be ‘transformed sperm’.&lt;ref name="Parkes"/&gt;{{rp|312}} Another suggested analogy is that breast milk was a refinement of uterine blood. It is also suggested since that milk is of the woman, her moods and dispositions are transferred through the breast milk. Parkes mentions that milk-kinship was “further endorsed as a canonical impediment to marriage by several eastern Christian churches”.&lt;ref name="Parkes"/&gt;{{rp|320}} This indicates that this procedure was widely practiced among numerous religious communities, not just Islamic communities, in the early modern Mediterranean.

===Héritier's somatic thesis===
Soraya Altorki (1980) published a pioneering article on Sunni Arab notions of kinship created through suckling breast milk (Arabic: ''rida’a orrada’''). Altorki indicated that milk kinship had received little attention from anthropologists, despite its recognised significance in Muslim family law as a complex impediment to marriage. Milk kinship has since attracted further fieldwork throughout Islamic Asia and North Africa, demonstrating its importance as a culturally distinctive institution of adoptive affiliation.

Héritier's [[Somatic_theory|somatic]] thesis posits that Islamic marriage between milk kin is forbidden because of an ancient pre-Islamic [[meme]] that is communicated in the Arab saying ‘the milk is from the man’.&lt;ref name=FH94&gt;Françoise Héritier: ''Identité de substance et parenté de lait dans le monde arabe'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Héritier’s somatic explanation has since been endorsed – and apparently confirmed – by several French ethnographers of the Maghreb, also being further developed in her monograph on incest.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Héritier: ''Two sisters and their daughters'' (1999: ch. 8)&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction, a few scholars have cited Islamic commentaries and jurisprudence. "A child is the product of the conjoint seed of man and woman . . . but milk is the property of woman alone; one should not conflate by analogy (qiyas) milk with male semen." Al-Qurtubi, Jami’ al-ahkam V.83, cited in Benkheira (2001a: 26). The rules of Sunni marital incest apply through a standard of adoptive kin relations. But the modern jurisprudence does not negate nor explain the origin of the [[taboo]].

Héritier explains Islamic juridical reckonings of milk kinship as the continuation of a somatic scheme of male filiative substances transmitted by lactation.&lt;ref name=FH94 /&gt; But Parker critically interrogates its supposition of a peculiar Arab folk-physiology of lactation, whereby breast milk is supposed to be transformed male semen, yet mentions that Héritier has properly focused attention on evidently contested issues of ‘patrifiliation’ by breast-feeding, which remain to be understood.&lt;ref name="Parkes"/&gt; Parker posits that this somatic scheme seems to be unsubstantiated by current ethnographies, and also unwarranted in understanding the juridical reckoning of milk kinship that it purports to explain.&lt;ref name="Parkes"/&gt;{{rp|310}}

== Practice in Eastern Christianity ==

Weisner-Hanks mentions the introduction in the fifteenth century of prohibitions in the Christian [[Canon Law]], in which one is not allowed to marry any one suspected to be of respective kin. Individuals who shared godparents, and great grandparents were prohibited against marrying. The prohibitions against marriage also  extended to that of natural godparents. This was because both natural and ‘foster’ or ‘spiritual’ parents had an investment on the child’s spiritual well being, which would not be achieved by going against Canon Law.&lt;ref name="Parkes"/&gt;{{rp|310}} The practice of milk kinship is paralleled quite frequently, among scholarly works, with that of Christian godparent-hood or spiritual kinship. Parkes states that in both milk kinship and god-or co-parenthood “we deal with a fictitious kinship relationship between people of unequal status that is embedded in a long-term exchange of goods and services that we know as patronage”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Merry Wiesner-Hanks]] (2006), ''Early Modern Europe, 1450-1789'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Iranians seemed to have “taken care to confine delegated suckling to subordinate non-kin - particularly those with whom marriage would be undesirable in any event”.&lt;ref name="Parkes"/&gt;{{rp|322}} Marriage taboos due to milk kinship were taken very seriously since some regarded breast milk to be refined female blood from the womb, thus conveying a ‘uterine substance’ of kinship.&lt;ref name="Parkes"/&gt;{{rp|314}} Children who were milk kin to each other were prohibited to marry as well as two children from different parents who were suckled by the same woman. It was as much of a taboo to marry your milk-brother or -sister, as it was to marry a biological brother or sister. It is extremely important to understand that in all cases “What is forbidden by blood kinship is equally forbidden by milk kinship”.&lt;ref&gt;Avner Giladi, "Breast-feeding in Medieval Islamic thought. A preliminary study of legal and medical writings", ''[[Journal of Family History]]'' 23 (1998). pp. 107-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Theosophy}}
'''Morya''' is one of the "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]" within modern [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] beliefs.  He is one of the [[Mahatmas]] who inspired the founding of the [[Theosophical Society]] and was engaged in a correspondence with two English [[Theosophist]]s living in India, [[A. P. Sinnett]] and [[A. O. Hume]].  The correspondence was published in 1923 by A. Trevor Barker, in the book [[The Mahatma Letters to A. P. Sinnett]].

==History==
[[File:Moryaportrait.jpg|thumb|right|A portrait of Master Morya]]
[[H. P. Blavatsky]], originally described the existence of a spiritual master whom she considered her guru, and who went by, among other names, Morya.  Blavatsky said that Morya and another master, [[Koot Hoomi]], were her primary guides in establishing the [[Theosophical Society]].  Blavatsky also wrote that Masters Morya and Koot Hoomi belonged to a group of highly developed humans known to some as the [[Great White Brotherhood]] or the White Lodge (though this is not how they described themselves).  Master Morya's personality has been depicted in some detail by various theosophical authors. A man "living on the earth, but possessed of developed senses that laughed at time and space." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1892-09-26/ed-1/seq-5/|title=The sun. (New York [N.Y.]) 1833-1916, September 26, 1892, Image 5|date=1892-09-26|access-date=2018-09-15|pages=5|issn=1940-7831}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand author P. Jenkins challenges that there is little evidence that Blavatsky's Masters, including Morya, ever existed.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Jenkins, ''Mystics and Messiahs'', p.41-42. Oxford University Press, 2000, NYC&lt;/ref&gt;  Author [[K. Paul Johnson]] wrote that Blavatsky gave conflicting versions of her meeting with Morya and suggests Blavatsky fictionalized the story, basing it on her encounter with an Italian political activist.&lt;ref&gt;K. Paul Johnson, ''The Masters Revealed: Madame Blavatsky and the Myth of the Great White Lodge'' (Albany: SUNY, 1994), 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters Albany, New York:1995 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Blavatsky's published works have been praised by New York papers as exhibiting immense research, in referring to her book Isis Unveiled the New York Sun&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1892-09-26/ed-1/seq-5/|title=The sun. (New York [N.Y.]) 1833-1916, September 26, 1892, Image 5|date=1892-09-26|access-date=2018-09-15|pages=5|issn=1940-7831}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes, "the strange part of this is, as I and many others can testify as eye witnesses to the production of the book, that the writer had no library in which to make researches and possessed no notes of investigation or reading previously done. All was written straight out of hand. And yet it is full of references to books in the British Museum and other great libraries, and every reference is correct. Either, then, we have, as to that book [referring to Isis Unveiled], a woman who was capable of storing in her memory a mass of facts, dates, numbers, titles, and subjects such as no other human being ever was capable of, or her claim to help from unseen beings is just." 

After Blavatsky's death, theosophists and others continued claiming to have met Morya or to have received communications from him.  [[William Quan Judge]], the leader of the American Section of the Theosophical Society, stated privately that he had received letters from Morya and other Adepts.  [[Annie Besant]], head of the European Section and co-head of the Esoteric Section with Judge, made public statements supporting the genuineness of those letters; but she later accused Judge of falsifying them, asserting that her suspicions of him were confirmed by the visitation of a Mahatma, presumably Master Morya, to whom she was linked.&lt;ref&gt;Annie Besant, ''The Case Against W. Q. Judge'' (1895), p. 13.  About Besant’s closeness to Morya, in a letter of 27 March 1891 to Judge, Blavatsky writes: “She is not psychic nor spiritual in the least—all intellect—and yet she hears the Master's voice when alone, sees His Light, and recognises His Voice from that of D____.”&lt;/ref&gt;  The ensuing controversy led to the break-up of the Society in 1895, but leaders in the increasingly fragmented movement continued making claims about having received communications and visitations from the Masters connected with the cause.  Theosophical writings offered vivid descriptions of Morya, his role in the Brotherhood, and his past lives.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters of the Masters of the Wisdom: Second Series'' Nos. 69 and 70; ''First Series'' No. 19; Wachtmeister, op. cit., Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incarnations==
Morya's earliest notable claimed incarnation is recorded by [[Annie Besant]] and [[C.W. Leadbeater]] (from, the source states, their research into the "[[akashic records]]" at the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society headquarters]] in [[Adyar (Tamil Nadu)]], [[India]] conducted in the  summer of 1910) as having been the [[Emperor]] of [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]] in 220,000 BC, ruling from his palace in the capital city, the ''City of the Golden Gates''.&lt;ref&gt;Besant, Annie and Leadbeater, C.W. ''Man: How, Whence, and Whither?''  Adyar, India:1913 Theosophical Publishing House Page 122 Note: On page xii of the introduction it is explained that the name ''Mars'' is used to refer to the reincarnating [[soul]] entity now known to Theosophists as Morya in his various incarnations.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ascended Masters teachings, some of the later incarnations that Morya is said to have had include:&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 - Summit University Press - "Morya - Master of the First Ray" pages 21 - 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 87-92 El Morya&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ascension==
Students of [[Ascended Master Teachings|Ascended Master Activities]] believe that Morya ascended in 1898, becoming an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]] and Chohan of the First Ray, and that his spiritual retreat is located at [[Darjeeling]], India.&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K..

The '''Norodom Ranariddh Party''' ('''NRP''', ''Kanakpak Norodom Ranariddh'') is a [[Cambodia]]n political party created by Prince [[Norodom Ranariddh]], who has left the Royalist [[FUNCINPEC]] party of which he was previously leader/chairman.&lt;ref&gt;AFP (3 October 2008). "[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gWKV3VxxqCCiS8y-ury-aS97clzw Cambodian prince quits politics after return from exile]", ''Google News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A congress of people chose to change the name of their political party called '''Khmer National Front Party''' to the Norodom Ranariddh Party on 16 November 2006 and elected Prince Samdech Krom Preah Norodom Ranariddh as the president of NRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123174905/http://www.norodomranariddhparty.com/english/|title=First anniversary of NRP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was briefly known as the '''Nationalist Party''' from 2008 to 2010.

==Political ideology==
{{Original research section|date = October 2008}}
The party promotes various ideologies altogether. Firstly its conservative-right ideology promotes the preservation of Cambodia's "cultural landmarks" while improving the capital city "[[Phnom Penh]]'s master plan" to mend "buildings in the city in order to" be an excellent "modern city." The party also wants to keep the existence of the " Khmer race and its culture, religion and language."&lt;ref name="PPP rundown"&gt;"[http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2008071120238/National-news/Party-profiles-An-election-rundown.html Party profiles: An election rundown]", ''Phnom Penh Post'' (11 July 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The NRP wants to nationally stop the "increase in the price of goods" they will get rid of "the monopoly on foreign good import" and take away "tariffs on" the necessary foods Cambodia gets from other countries.&lt;ref name="VN platform"&gt;"[http://vuthanews.info/political-platform/norodom-ranariddh-party-nrp/ Norodom Ranariddh Party (NRP)]". VuthaNews.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the ideas it promotes in its left wing ideology it believes in  making the "minimum wages for factory workers" become larger.&lt;ref name="PPP rundown" /&gt; The NRP would oppose the "blocks of flats which have been constructed to poor technical standards" particularly those with no necessary emergency systems.&lt;ref name="VN platform" /&gt;
Finally the liberal part of this party's ideology is promoting freedom from the rulers of Cambodia who only think of "power, money and themselves" and because of that they would frighten Cambodian people by being a "dictatorial" and militaristic government. Therefore, NRP will oppose this and defend "democracy" and the "rule of law". Apart from that, finally with the party's position on the "city's judicial systems" it will "reform" it freeing it from any damaging misguidance so it can give its "independence and fairness for the people."&lt;ref name="VN platform" /&gt;

==Political activities==
The Norodom Ranariddh Party has created recently an alliance with three political parties called the Sam Rainsy Party, FUNCINPEC party and the Human Rights Party. Together they wanted the international community and Cambodia to oppose the Cambodian elections that were "won" on 27 July 2008 by the [[Cambodian People's Party]] because this alliance of four parties say that the CPP "manipulated and rigged" the elections.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.norodomranariddhparty.com/english/images/4party.jpg Four Major Political Parties Reject Election Results]" (JPG). Norodom Ranariddh Party (28 July 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Now some time recently Prince Norodom Ranariddh had chosen to go and be in "retirement from politics" on Friday 3 October 2008. However he still will have influence on "NRP policy". While that's happening the party will "appoint" as "acting president" Chhim Siek Leng "as its next leader."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phnompenhpost.com/search/node/index%20php%202008100621984%20National%20news%20NRP%20appoints%20new%20president|title=Search|website=Phnom Penh Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norodom Ranariddh entered politics again on 11 December 2010, when the NRP (which had been known as the Nationalist Party after Norodom Ranariddh left) renamed itself again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/7228162.html|title=Cambodia's Prince Ranariddh officially restarts political career - People's Daily Online|website=english.people.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1543 On the Jews and Their Lies by Martin Luther.jpg|thumb|Title page of [[Martin Luther]]'s ''On the Jews and Their Lies''. [[Wittenberg]], 1543]]

'''''On the Jews and Their Lies''''' ({{lang-de|Von den Jüden und iren Lügen}}; in modern spelling {{lang|de| Von den Juden und ihren Lügen}}) is a 65,000-word [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] treatise written in 1543 by the German [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] leader [[Martin Luther]].

Luther's attitude toward the Jews took different forms during his lifetime. In his earlier period, until 1537 or not much earlier, he wanted to convert Jews to [[Lutheranism]] (Protestant Christianity), but failed. In his later period when he wrote this particular treatise, he denounced them and urged their persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=631&amp;letter=L "Luther, Martin"], ''JewishEncyclopedia.com''. See also the note ''supra'' referring to Robert Michael.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the treatise, he argues that Jewish [[Synagogue|synagogues]] and [[yeshiva|schools]] be set on fire, their [[siddur|prayer book]]s destroyed, [[rabbi]]s forbidden to preach, homes burned, and property and money confiscated. They should be shown no mercy or kindness,&lt;ref&gt;Michael, Robert. "Luther, Luther Scholars, and the Jews," ''Encounter'' 46:4, (Autumn 1985), p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; afforded no legal protection,&lt;ref name=Michael343&gt;Michael, Robert. "Luther, Luther Scholars, and the Jews," ''Encounter'' 46:4, (Autumn 1985), p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; and "these poisonous envenomed worms" should be drafted into forced labor or expelled for all time.&lt;ref name=Luther1&gt;[[Martin Luther|Luther, Martin]]. ''On the Jews and Their Lies'', ''Luthers Werke''. 47:268–271; Trans. Martin H. Bertram, in ''Luther's Works''. (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; He also seems to advocate their murder, writing "[W]e are at fault in not slaying them".&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Luther|Luther, Martin]]. ''On the Jews and Their Lies'', cited in Michael, Robert. "Luther, Luther Scholars, and the Jews," ''Encounter'' 46 (Autumn 1985) No. 4:343–344.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
In the treatise, [[Martin Luther]] describes [[Jew]]s as a "base, whoring people, that is, no people of [[God in Christianity|God]], and their boast of lineage, circumcision, and law must be accounted as filth".&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Luther|Luther, Martin]]. ''On the Jews and Their Lies'', 154, 167, 229, cited in Michael, Robert. ''Holy Hatred: Christianity, Antisemitism, and the Holocaust''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther wrote that they are "full of the devil's feces ... which they wallow in like swine",&lt;ref&gt;[[Heiko Oberman|Oberman, Heiko]]. ''Luthers Werke''. Erlangen 1854, 32:282, 298, in Grisar, Hartmann. ''Luther''. St. Louis 1915, 4:286 and 5:406, cited in Michael, Robert. ''Holy Hatred: Christianity, Antisemitism, and the Holocaust''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[synagogue]] is an "incorrigible whore and an evil slut".&lt;ref name=Michael112&gt;Michael, Robert, ''Holy Hatred: Christianity, Antisemitism, and the Holocaust''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first ten sections of the treatise, Luther expounds, at considerable length, upon his views concerning Jews and [[Judaism]] and how these compare to [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and Protestant Christianity. Following the exposition, Section XI of the treatise advises Protestants to carry out seven remedial actions. These are
# to burn down Jewish synagogues and [[yeshiva|schools]] and warn people against them;
# to refuse to let Jews own houses among Christians;
# for Jewish religious writings to be taken away;
# for [[rabbi]]s to be forbidden to preach;
# to offer no protection to Jews on highways;
# for [[usury]] to be prohibited and for all silver and gold to be removed, put aside for safekeeping, and given back to Jews who truly convert; and
# to give young, strong Jews flail, axe, spade, and spindle, and let them earn their bread in the sweat of their brow.&lt;ref name=Luther2&gt;[[Martin Luther|Luther, Martin]]. ''The Jews and Their Lies,'' (Publisher: Christian Nationalist Crusade, 1948).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of Luther's views==
{{main|Martin Luther and antisemitism}}

===Medieval Church and the Jews===
{{Antisemitism}}
Early in his life, Luther had argued that the Jews had been prevented from [[Conversion to Christianity|converting to Christianity]] by the proclamation of what he believed to be an impure [[gospel]] by the [[Catholic Church]], and he believed they would respond favorably to the [[evangelical]] message if it were presented to them gently. He expressed concern for the poor conditions in which they were forced to live, and insisted that anyone denying that [[Jesus]] was born a Jew was committing [[heresy]].&lt;ref name=Berenbaum8/&gt;

Luther's first known comment about the Jews is in a letter written to [[George Spalatin|Reverend Spalatin]] in 1514:
{{bquote|Conversion of the Jews will be the work of God alone operating from within, and not of man working – or rather playing – from without. If these offences be taken away, worse will follow. For they are thus given over by the wrath of God to reprobation, that they may become incorrigible, as [[Ecclesiastes]] says, for every one who is incorrigible is rendered worse rather than better by correction.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, "[http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/luther/letters/LuthertoSpalatin.txt Luther to George Spalatin]" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702190514/http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/luther/letters/LuthertoSpalatin.txt |date=2007-07-02 }}, in ''Luther's Correspondence and Other Contemporaneous Letters'', trans. [[Henry Preserved Smith]] (Philadelphia: Lutheran Publication Society, 1913), 1:29.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1519, Luther challenged the doctrine ''[[Servitus Judaeorum]]'' ("Servitude of the Jews"), established in ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' by [[Justinian I]] in 529. He wrote: "Absurd theologians defend hatred for the Jews. ... What Jew would consent to enter our ranks when he sees the cruelty and enmity we wreak on them – that in our behavior towards them we less resemble Christians than beasts?"&lt;ref&gt;Luther quoted in Elliot Rosenberg, ''But Were They Good for the Jews?'' (New York: Birch Lane Press, 1997), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his commentary on the ''[[Magnificat]]'', Luther is critical of the emphasis Judaism places on the [[Torah]], the first five books of the [[Old Testament]]. He states that they "undertook to keep the law by their own strength, and failed to learn from it their needy and cursed state".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, ''The Magnificat'', trans. A. T. W. Steinhaeuser, in ''Luther's Works'' (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1956), 21:354.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, he concludes that God's grace will continue for Jews as [[Abraham]]'s descendants for all time, since they may always become Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Briese, "Martin Luther and the Jews", ''Lutheran Forum'' 34 (2000) No. 2:32.&lt;/ref&gt; "We ought&amp;nbsp;... not to treat the Jews in so unkindly a spirit, for there are future Christians among them."&lt;ref&gt;Luther, ''Magnificat'', 21:354f.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1523 essay ''That Jesus Christ Was Born a Jew'', Luther condemned the inhuman treatment of the Jews and urged Christians to treat them kindly. Luther's fervent desire was that Jews would hear the gospel proclaimed clearly and be moved to convert to Christianity. Thus he argued:

{{bquote|If I had been a Jew and had seen such dolts and blockheads govern and teach the Christian faith, I would sooner have become a hog than a Christian. They have dealt with the Jews as if they were dogs rather than human beings; they have done little else than deride them and seize their property. When they baptize them they show them nothing of Christian doctrine or life, but only subject them to popishness and monkery&amp;nbsp;... If the apostles, who also were Jews, had dealt with us [[Gentiles]] as we Gentiles deal with the Jews, there would never have been a Christian among the Gentiles ... When we are inclined to boast of our position [as Christians] we should remember that we are but Gentiles, while the Jews are of the lineage of Christ. We are aliens and in-laws; they are blood relatives, cousins, and brothers of our Lord. Therefore, if one is to boast of flesh and blood the Jews are actually nearer to Christ than we are&amp;nbsp;... If we really want to help them, we must be guided in our dealings with them not by papal law but by the law of Christian love. We must receive them cordially, and permit them to trade and work with us, that they may have occasion and opportunity to associate with us, hear our Christian teaching, and witness our Christian life. If some of them should prove stiff-necked, what of it? After all, we ourselves are not all good Christians either.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, "That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew", trans. Walter I. Brandt, in ''Luther's Works'' (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1962), pp. 200–201, 229.&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

===Against the Jews===
In August 1536, Luther's prince, [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony]], issued a mandate that prohibited Jews from inhabiting, engaging in business in, or passing through his realm. An [[Alsace|Alsatian]] [[shtadlan]], Rabbi [[Josel of Rosheim]], asked a reformer, [[Wolfgang Capito]], to approach Luther in order to obtain an audience with the prince, but Luther refused every intercession.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Brecht, ''Martin Luther'' (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1985–1993), 3:336.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Josel, Luther referred to his unsuccessful attempts to convert the Jews: "I would willingly do my best for your people but I will not contribute to your [Jewish] obstinacy by my own kind actions. You must find another intermediary with my good lord."&lt;ref&gt;Luther’s letter to Rabbi Josel as cited by Gordon Rupp, ''Martin Luther and the Jews'' (London: The Council of Christians and Jews, 1972), 14. According to {{cite web |url=http://www.ntrmin.org/Luther%20and%20the%20Jews%20(Web).htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104181522/http://www.ntrmin.org/Luther%20and%20the%20Jews%20%28Web%29.htm |archivedate=2005-11-04 |df= }}. This paragraph is not available in the English edition of Luther's works.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heiko Oberman]] notes this event as significant in Luther's attitude toward the Jews: "Even today this refusal is often judged to be the decisive turning point in Luther's career from friendliness to hostility toward the Jews";&lt;ref&gt;[[Heiko Oberman]], ''Luther: Man Between God and the Devil'' (New York: Image Books, 1989), p.293.&lt;/ref&gt; yet, Oberman contends that Luther would have denied any such "turning point". Rather he felt that Jews were to be treated in a "friendly way" in order to avoid placing unnecessary obstacles in their path to Christian conversion, a genuine concern of Luther.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Luther's "[[s:Warning Against the Jews (1546)|]]" (1546); original German text: ''Weimar Ausgabe'' 51:194–196; J. G. Walch, ''Dr. Martin Luthers Sämmtliche Schriften'', 23 vols. (St. Louis: Concordia, 1883), 12:1264–1267).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] writes that "Luther was not content with verbal abuse. Even before he wrote his anti-Semitic pamphlet, he got Jews expelled from [[Saxony]] in 1537, and in the 1540s he drove them from many German towns; he tried unsuccessfully to get the elector to expel them from [[Brandenburg]] in 1543."&lt;ref name=Johnson242&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Johnson, Paul]]. ''A History of the Jews'', p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Berenbaum]] writes that Luther's reliance on the [[Bible]] as the sole source of Christian authority fed his later fury toward Jews over their rejection of Jesus as the [[messiah]].&lt;ref name=Berenbaum8&gt;[[Michael Berenbaum|Berenbaum, Michael]]. ''The World Must Know'', [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; For Luther, salvation depended on the belief that [[Jesus in Christianity|the belief Jesus was]] was the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]], a belief that [[Judaism's view of Jesus|adherents of Judaism do not share]]. Graham Noble writes that Luther wanted to save Jews, in his own terms, not exterminate them, but beneath his apparent reasonableness toward them, there was a "biting intolerance", which produced "ever more furious demands for their conversion to his own brand of Christianity". (Noble, 1–2) When they failed to convert, he turned on them.&lt;ref name=Michael1985&gt;Michael, Robert. "Luther, Luther Scholars, and the Jews", ''Encounter'' 46 (Autumn 1985) No. 4:343–344.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History since publication==
The prevailing scholarly view since the [[Second World War]] is that the treatise exercised a major and persistent influence on Germany's attitude toward its Jewish citizens in the centuries between the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallmann, Johannes. "The Reception of Luther's Writings on the Jews from the Reformation to the End of the 19th Century", ''Lutheran Quarterly'', n.s. 1 (Spring 1987) 1:72–97. "The assertion that Luther's expressions of anti-Jewish sentiment have been of major and persistent influence in the centuries after the Reformation, and that there exists a continuity between Protestant anti-Judaism and modern racially oriented antiSemitism, is at present wide-spread in the literature; since the Second World War it has understandably become the prevailing opinion."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael, Robert. ''Holy Hatred: Christianity, Antisemitism, and the Holocaust''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006; see chapter 4 "The Germanies from Luther to Hitler", pp. 105–151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hillerbrand, Hans J. "Martin Luther", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007. "[H]is strident pronouncements against the Jews, especially toward the end of his life, have raised the question of whether Luther significantly encouraged the development of German antisemitism. Although many scholars have taken this view, this perspective puts far too much emphasis on Luther and not enough on the larger peculiarities of German history."&lt;/ref&gt; Four hundred years after it was written, the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] displayed ''On the Jews and Their Lies'' during [[Nuremberg rallies]], and the city of [[Nuremberg]] presented a [[Edition (book)|first edition]] to [[Julius Streicher]], editor of the Nazi newspaper ''[[Der Stürmer]]'', the newspaper describing it, on Streicher's first encounter with the treatise in 1937, as the most radically [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] tract ever published.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc H. Ellis|Ellis, Marc H.]] "[http://www3.baylor.edu/American_Jewish/everythingthatusedtobehere/resources/PowerPoints/Christian%20Anti-Semitism%20(part%202).ppt Hitler and the Holocaust, Christian Anti-Semitism]" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710100514/http://www3.baylor.edu/American_Jewish/everythingthatusedtobehere/resources/PowerPoints/Christian%20Anti-Semitism%20%28part%202%29.ppt |date=2007-07-10 }}, Baylor University Center for American and Jewish Studies, Spring 2004, slide 14.

Against this view, theologian [[Johannes Wallmann (theologian)|Johannes Wallmann]] writes that the treatise had no continuity of influence in Germany, and was in fact largely ignored during the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="Wallmann1987"&gt;Wallmann, Johannes. "The Reception of Luther's Writings on the Jews from the Reformation to the End of the 19th Century", ''Lutheran Quarterly'', n.s. 1, Spring 1987, 1:72–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Hillerbrand argues that to focus on Luther's role in the development of German [[antisemitism]] is to underestimate the "larger peculiarities of German history".&lt;ref name="HillerbrandEB"&gt;Hillerbrand, Hans J. "Martin Luther", Encyclopædia Britannica, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, some [[Lutheranism|Lutheran church]] bodies have formally denounced and dissociated themselves from Luther's vitriol about the Jews. In November 1998, on the 60th anniversary of {{lang|de|[[Kristallnacht]]}}, the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria]] issued a statement: "It is imperative for the Lutheran Church, which knows itself to be indebted to the work and tradition of Martin Luther, to take seriously also his anti-Jewish utterances, to acknowledge their theological function, and to reflect on their consequences. It has to distance itself from every [expression of] [[anti-Judaism]] in Lutheran theology."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcrelations.net/en/?id=993 "Christians and Jews: A Declaration of the Lutheran Church of Bavaria"], 24 November 1998, also printed in ''Freiburger Rundbrief'', 6:3 (1999), pp.191-197.

[[File:John William Waterhouse - Consulting the Oracle - Christie's.jpg|right|thumb|325px|''[[Consulting the Oracle]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]], showing eight priestesses in a temple of prophecy]]

In [[classical antiquity]], an '''oracle''' was a person or agency considered to provide wise and insightful counsel or [[prophecy|prophetic]] [[prediction]]s or [[precognition]] of the future, inspired by the gods. As such it is a form of [[divination]].

== Description ==
The word ''oracle'' comes from the [[Latin]] verb ''ōrāre'', "to speak" and properly refers to the priest or priestess uttering the prediction. In extended use, ''oracle'' may also refer to the ''site of the oracle'', and to the oracular utterances themselves, called ''khrēsmē'' (χρησμοί) in Greek.

Oracles were thought to be portals through which the gods spoke directly to people. In this sense they were different from ''seers'' (''manteis'', μάντεις) who interpreted signs sent by the gods through bird signs, animal entrails, and other various methods.&lt;ref name=flower&gt;Flower, Michael Attyah. ''The Seer in Ancient Greece.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important oracles of Greek antiquity were [[Pythia]], priestess to [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]], and the oracle of [[Dione (Titaness)|Dione]] and [[Zeus]] at [[Dodona]] in [[Epirus]]. Other oracles of Apollo were located at [[Didyma]] and [[Mallus (city)|Mallus]] on the coast of [[Anatolia]], at [[ancient Corinth|Corinth]] and [[Bassae]] in the [[Peloponnese]], and at the islands of [[Delos]] and [[Aegina]] in the Aegean Sea.

The [[Sibylline Oracles]] are a collection of oracular utterances written in Greek [[hexameter]]s ascribed to the [[Sibyl]]s, prophetesses who uttered divine revelations in frenzied states.

==Origins==
[[Walter Burkert]] observes that "Frenzied women from whose lips the god speaks" are recorded in the [[Near East]] as in [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in the second millennium BC and in Assyria in the first millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Burkert.''Greek Religion''. Harvard University Press.1985.p 116-118&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt the goddess [[Wadjet]] (eye of the moon) was depicted as a snake-headed woman or a woman with two snake-heads. Her oracle was in the renowned temple in [[Per-Wadjet]] (Greek name [[Buto]]). The oracle of Wadjet may have been the source for the oracular tradition which spread from Egypt to Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', ii 55, and vii 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Evans linked Wadjet with the "[[Minoan snake goddess figurines|Minoan Snake Goddess]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cristopher L.C. Whitcomp.''Minoan Snake goddess''.8.''Snakes, Egypt, Magic and wome''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the oracle of [[Dodona]] she is called [[Dione (Titaness/Oceanid)|Diōnē]] (the feminine form of ''Diós'', [[genitive]] of ''PDyaeus''; or of ''dīos'', "godly", literally "heavenly"), who represents the earth-fertile soil, probably the chief female goddess of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]] pantheon. [[Python (mythology)|Python]], daughter (or son) of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] was the earth dragon of [[Delphi]] represented as a [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] and became the chthonic deity, enemy of [[Apollo]], who slew her and possessed the oracle.&lt;ref&gt;''Hymn to Pythian Apollo''.363,369&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pythia (Delphi)==
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;When the Prytanies' seat shines white in the island of Siphnos,
White-browed all the forum—need then of a true seer's wisdom—
Danger will threat from a wooden boat, and a herald in scarlet.&lt;/poem&gt;|The Pythoness, in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'', as translated in: {{cite book |title=The History of Herodotus: A New English Version |volume=II |author1-link=George Rawlinson|first1=George|last1=Rawlinson |first2=Henry Creswicke|last2=Rawlinson |first3=John Gardner|last3=Wilkinson |page=376 |date=1862 |location=London |publisher=John Murray |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ijENAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA376&amp;dq=treasury+Siphnos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wMbcT-OUEYWp8AOf1IGwCw&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=treasury%20Siphnos&amp;f=false |accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Pythia]] was the mouthpiece of the oracles of the god [[Apollo]], and was also known as the Oracle of Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, G.M.A. Grube, J.M. Cooper - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3WFKMKNkzcAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Trial+and+Death+of+Socrates+%28Third+Edition%29:+Euthyphro,+Apology,+Crito,+Death+Scene+from+Phaedo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y3U5VfnNEMuwPP_ugYgM&amp;ved=0CCYQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Trial%20and%20Death%20of%20Socrates%20(Third%20Edition)%3A%20Euthyphro%2C%20Apology%2C%20Crito%2C%20Death%20Scene%20from%20Phaedo&amp;f=false ''The Trial and Death of Socrates'' (Third Edition): "Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Death Scene from Phaedo"] (page 24 - footnote 7) Hackett Publishing, 2000; {{ISBN|1603846476}} [Retrieved 2015-04-25]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pythia was not conceived to be infallible and in fact, according to Sourvinou-Inwood in ''What is Polis Religion?'', the ancient Greeks were aware of this and concluded the unknowability of the divine. In this way, the ‘revelations’ of the Oracles were not seen as ‘objective’ truth (as they consulted many) [see: Hyp. 4. 14-15]. The Pythia gave prophecies only on the seventh day of each month, seven being the number most associated with [[Apollo]], during the nine warmer months of the year; thus, Delphi was the major source of [[divination]] for the ancient Greeks. Many wealthy individuals bypassed the hordes of people attempting a consultation by making additional animal sacrifices to please the oracle lest their request go unanswered. As a result, [[divination#Divination in Ancient Greece|seers]] were the main source of everyday divination.

The temple was changed to a centre for the worship of Apollo during the classical period of Greece and priests were added to the temple organization—although the tradition regarding prophecy remained unchanged—and the priestesses continued to provide the services of the oracle exclusively. It is from this institution that the English word, oracle, is derived{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}.

The Delphic Oracle exerted considerable influence throughout Hellenic culture. Distinctively, this female was essentially the highest authority both civilly and religiously in male-dominated [[ancient Greece]]. She responded to the questions of citizens, foreigners, kings, and philosophers on issues of political impact, war, duty, crime, family, laws—even personal issues.&lt;ref&gt;Broad, W. J. (2007), p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

The semi-Hellenic countries around the Greek world, such as [[Lydia]], [[Caria]], and even [[Egypt]] also respected her and came to Delphi as [[supplicant]]s.

[[Croesus]], king of Lydia beginning in 560 B.C., tested the oracles of the world to discover which gave the most accurate prophecies. He sent out emissaries to seven sites who were all to ask the oracles on the same day what the king was doing at that very moment. Croesus proclaimed the oracle at Delphi to be the most accurate, who correctly reported that the king was making a lamb-and-tortoise stew, and so he graced her with a magnitude of precious gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Broad, W. J. (2007), p.51-53&lt;/ref&gt; He then consulted Delphi before attacking [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], and according to Herodotus was advised: "If you cross the river, a great empire will be destroyed". Believing the response favourable, Croesus attacked, but it was his own empire that ultimately was destroyed by the Persians.

She allegedly also proclaimed that there was no man wiser than [[Socrates]], to which Socrates said that, if so, this was because he alone was aware of his own ignorance. After this confrontation, Socrates dedicated his life to a search for knowledge that was one of the founding events of western [[philosophy]]. He claimed that she was "an essential guide to personal and state development."&lt;ref&gt;Broad, W. J. (2007), p.63. Socrates also argued that the oracle's effectiveness was rooted in her ability to abandon herself completely to a higher power by way of insanity or "sacred madness."&lt;/ref&gt; This Oracle's last recorded response was given in 362 AD, to [[Julian the Apostate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Carol G.|title=Paths from Ancient Greece|year=1988|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIdcStQg4g0C&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oracle's powers were highly sought after and never doubted. Any inconsistencies between prophecies and events were dismissed as failure to correctly interpret the responses, not an error of the oracle.&lt;ref&gt;Broad, W. J. (2007), p.15&lt;/ref&gt;  Very often prophecies were worded ambiguously, so as to cover all contingencies – especially so ''ex post facto''.  One famous such response to a query about participation in a military campaign was "You will go you will return never in war will you perish".  This gives the recipient liberty to place a comma before or after the word "never", thus covering both possible outcomes.  Another was the response to the Athenians when the vast army of king [[Xerxes I]] was approaching Athens with the intent of razing the city to the ground.  "Only the wooden palisades may save you"{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, answered the oracle, probably aware that there was sentiment for sailing to the safety of southern Italy and re-establishing Athens there.  Some thought that it was a recommendation to fortify the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] with a wooden fence and make a stand there.  Others, [[Themistocles]] among them, said the oracle was clearly for fighting at sea, the metaphor intended to mean war ships.  Others still insisted that their case was so hopeless that they should board every ship available and flee to [[Italy]], where they would be safe beyond any doubt.  In the event, variations of all three interpretations were attempted: some barricaded the Acropolis, the civilian population was evacuated over sea to nearby [[Salamis Island]] and to [[Troizen]], and the war fleet [[Battle of Salamis|fought victoriously at Salamis Bay]].  Should utter destruction have happened, it could always be claimed that the oracle had called for fleeing to Italy after all.

==Dodona==
[[Dodona]] was another oracle devoted to the [[Mother Goddess]] identified at other sites with [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] or [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], but here called [[Dione (Titaness/Oceanid)|Dione]]. The shrine of Dodona was the oldest Hellenic oracle, according to the fifth-century historian Herodotus and in fact dates to pre-Hellenic times, perhaps as early as the second millennium BC when the tradition probably spread from Egypt. Zeus displaced the Mother goddess and assimilated her as [[Aphrodite]].

It became the second most important oracle in ancient Greece, which later was dedicated to [[Zeus]] and to [[Heracles]] during the classical period of Greece. At Dodona Zeus was worshipped as Zeus Naios or Naos (god of springs [[Naiads]], from a spring which existed under the oak), and Zeus Bouleos (cancellor). Priestesses and priests interpreted the rustling of the oak leaves to determine the correct actions to be taken. The oracle was shared by Dione and Zeus.

==Trophonius==
[[Trophonius]] was an oracle at [[Lebadea]] of [[Boeotia]] devoted to the chthonian Zeus Trophonius. Trophonius is derived from the Greek word "trepho" (nourish) and he was a Greek hero, or demon or god. [[Demeter]]-[[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] was his nurse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].''Guide to Greece'' 9.39.2–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Europa (in Greek: broad-eyes) was a Phoenician princess whom Zeus, having transformed himself into a white bull, abducted and carried to Creta, and is equated with [[Astarte]] as a moon goddess by ancient sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian of Samosata]].[[De Dea Syria]].4&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars connect Astarte with the Minoan snake goddess, whose cult as Aphrodite spread from Creta to Greece.&lt;ref&gt;R.Wunderlich.''The secret of Creta''.Efstathiadis Group.Athens 1987.p 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oracle of Menestheus==

Near the '''Menestheus's port''' or '''Menesthei Portus''' ({{lang-el|Μενεσθέως λιμήν}}), modern [[El Puerto de Santa María]], [[Spain]], was the Oracle of Menestheus ({{lang-el|Μαντεῖον τοῦ Μενεσθέως}}), to whom, also, the inhabitants of [[Cádiz|Gades]] offered sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/3A*.html|title=LacusCurtius • Strabo's Geography — Book III Chapter 1|website=penelope.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=menesthei-portus-geo|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854), MENESTHEI PORTUS|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Oracles" in other cultures==
{{Main|Divination}}
The term "oracle" is also applied in modern English to parallel institutions of divination in other cultures.
Specifically, it is used in the context of [[Christianity]] for the concept of [[divine revelation]], and in the context of [[Judaism]] for the [[Urim and Thummim]] breastplate, and in general any utterance considered [[prophecy|prophetic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] s.v. "oracle ''n.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{Main|Oracle bone|I Ching}}
[[File:Shang dynasty inscribed scapula.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Oracle bone]] of the [[Shang dynasty]], ancient China]]
In China, [[oracle bones]] were used for divination in the late [[Shang dynasty]], (c. 1600–1046 BC). Diviners applied heat to these bones, usually ox scapulae or tortoise plastrons, and interpreted the resulting cracks.

A different divining method, using the stalks of the [[Achillea millefolium|yarrow plant]], was practiced in the subsequent [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256 BC).  Around the late 9th century BC, the divination system was recorded in the ''[[I Ching]]'', or "Book of Changes", a collection of linear signs used as oracles.  In addition to its oracular power, the ''I Ching'' has had a major influence on the philosophy, literature and statecraft of China since the Zhou period.

===Celtic polytheism===
In [[Celtic polytheism]], divination was performed by the priestly caste, either the [[druid]]s or the [[vates]]. This is reflected in the role of "seers" in [[Dark Age Wales]] (''[[dryw]]'') and [[History of Ireland 400–800|Ireland]] (''[[fáith]]'').

===Hinduism===
In ancient [[India]], the oracle was known as Akashwani or Ashareera vani (a person without body or unseen) or Asariri (Tamil), literally meaning "voice from the sky" and was related to the message of a god. Oracles played key roles in many of the major incidents of the epics [[Mahabharata]] and [[Ramayana]]. An example is that [[Kamsa]] (or Kansa), the evil uncle of lord [[Krishna]], was informed by an oracle that the eighth son of his sister [[Devaki]] would kill him. However, there are no references in any Indian literature of the oracle being a specific person.

There are still a few existing and publicly accessible oracles in India. Examples include the Copper Oracle (Tamrapothi) and Silver Oracle (Rupapothi) of Shri Achyutanda Das. These oracles are accessible to everyone at Pothi Ashram located in Kakatpur, Odisha, India.

===Tibetan Buddhism===
In [[Tibet]], oracles have played, and continue to play, an important part in religion and government. The word "oracle" is used by Tibetans to refer to the spirit that enters those men and women who act as [[Mediumship|media]] between the natural and the spiritual realms. The media are, therefore, known as ''kuten'', which literally means, "the physical basis".

The [[Dalai Lama]], who lives in exile in northern India, still consults an oracle known as the ''[[Nechung Oracle]]'', which is considered the official state oracle of the government of Tibet. The Dalai Lama has according to centuries-old custom, consulted the Nechung Oracle during the new year festivities of [[Losar]].&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, Tenzin (1988). ''Freedom in Exile: the Autobiography of the Dalai Lama of Tibet.'' Fully revised and updated. Lancaster Place, London, UK: Abacus Books (A Division of Little, Brown and Company UK). {{ISBN|0-349-11111-1}}. p.233&lt;/ref&gt; Nechung and Gadhong are the primary oracles currently consulted; former oracles such as Karmashar and Darpoling are no longer active in exile. The Gadhong oracle has died leaving Nechung to be the only primary oracle.  Another oracle the Dalai Lama consults is the ''[[Tenma goddesses|Tenma Oracle]]'', for which a young Tibetan woman by the name of Khandro La is the medium for the mountain goddesses Tseringma along with the other 11 goddesses. The Dalai Lama gives a complete description of the process of [[trance]] and [[spirit possession]] in his book ''Freedom in Exile''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tibet.com/Buddhism/nechung_hh.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205234136/http://www.tibet.com/Buddhism/nechung_hh.html |archivedate=2006-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dorje Shugden oracles were once consulted by the Dalai Lamas until the 14th Dalai Lama banned the practice, even though he consulted Dorje Shugden for advice to escape and was successful in it.  Due to the ban, many of the abbots that were worshippers of Dorje Shugden have been forced to go against the Dalai Lama.

===Pre-Columbian Americas===
In the migration myth of the Mexitin, i.e., the early [[Aztec]]s, a [[mummy]]-bundle (perhaps an [[effigy]]) carried by four priests directed the trek away from the cave of origins by giving oracles. An oracle led to the foundation of [[Mexico-Tenochtitlan]]. The [[Yucatec Maya]]s knew oracle priests or ''chilanes'', literally 'mouthpieces' of the deity. Their written repositories of traditional knowledge, the Books of [[Chilam Balam]], were all ascribed to one famous oracle priest who correctly had predicted the coming of the Spaniards and its associated disasters.

===Nigeria===
The [[Igbo people]] of southeastern [[Nigeria]] in [[Africa]] have a long tradition of using oracles.  In Igbo villages, oracles were usually female [[priest]]esses to a particular deity, usually dwelling in a cave or other secluded location away from urban areas, and, much as the oracles of ancient Greece, would deliver prophecies in an ecstatic state to visitors seeking advice. Two of their ancient oracles became especially famous during the pre-colonial period: the Agbala oracle at [[Awka]] and the Chukwu oracle at [[Arochukwu]].&lt;ref&gt;Webster J.B. and Boahen A.A., ''The Revolutionary Years, West Africa since 1800'', Longman, London, p. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the vast majority of Igbos today are [[Christianity|Christian]], many of them still use oracles.

Amongst the related [[Yoruba people]]s of the same country, the [[Babalawo]]s (and their female counterparts, the Iyanifas) serve collectively as the principal aspects of the tribe's World-famous [[Ifa divination]] system. Due to this, they customarily officiate at a great many of its traditional and religious ceremonies.

===Norse mythology===
In [[Norse mythology]], [[Odin]] took the severed head of the god [[Mimir]] to [[Asgard]] for consultation as an oracle.  The ''[[Havamal]]'' and other sources relate the [[sacrifice]] of Odin for the oracular [[Runes]] whereby he lost an eye (external sight) and won wisdom (internal sight; [[insight]]).

===Hawaii===
In [[Hawaii]], oracles were found at certain [[heiau]], Hawaiian temples. These oracles were found in towers covered in white [[kapa]] cloth made from plant fibres. In here, priests received the will of gods. These towers were called "'Anu'u." An example of this can be found at Ahu'ena heiau in [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gohawaii.about.com/od/bigislandofhawaiiphotos/ig/kailua-kona/kailua_kona_038.htm|title='Anu'u (oracle tower) and Ki'i Akua (temple images) at 'Ahu'ena Heiau in Kailua-Kona on Hawaii's Big Island|author=John Fischer|work=About.com Travel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Our Lady of Andacollo''' ({{lang-es|Nuestra Señora de Andacollo}}), also known as the '''Virgin of Andacollo''' ({{lang-es|Virgen de Andacollo}}), is a celebrated [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] statue of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Virgin Mary]] located in the town of [[Andacollo]], in the [[Coquimbo Region]] in the north of [[Chile]]. The carving is the centre of the annual ''Fiesta Grande de la Virgen'' (Great Festival of the Virgin) that draws thousands of pilgrims from around the world in December.&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUpqvd3pyf8C&amp;pg=PA169 Graham, Melissa and Benso, Andrew, ''Rough Guide to Chile'', p.169, retrieved January 12, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== Origins ==
The small wooden statue of the Virgin Mary is said to have been found by a local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous person]] near the mines of [[Andacollo]] at the beginning of the [[Conquest of Chile|conquest period]]. There are many explanations for how the statue came to be where it was found. The most accepted holds that it was left there by a Spanish soldier or by priests who had fled with the statue after the 1549 attack on the city of [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]] by the indigenous population.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;
 
== Veneration ==
After four centuries of veneration in Andacollo and devotion coming from beyond Chilean borders, Cardinal [[Mariano Rampolla]] del Tindaro decreed on 15 June  1899, at the command of [[Pope Leo XIII]], that the statue be given a [[Canonical coronation]]  The decree was implemented by the [[Claretians]], who took on stewardship of the sanctuary in 1900, and the crown and jewels were paid for in large part by local fundraising. The statue of Our Lady of Andacollo was crowned on 26 December  1901.

Four churches have been built for the Virgin over the years. The first was constructed in the 16th century and the second in the 17th century, but this only lasted until 1776. The third church, constructed in the 18th century after undergoing numerous repairs for earthquake damage, is where the image of the Virgin now resides for most of the year. Finally, between 1873 and 1893, a new church was constructed which was declared a [[minor basilica]] by [[Pope John Paul II]], the Basilica of Our Lady of Andacollo.&lt;ref&gt;Agustín Cabré Rufatt, C.M.F., "El Santuario de Andacollo", pp. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
The town of Andacollo is visited every year by thousands of pilgrims from Chile and abroad, the majority of whom come for the ''Fiesta Grande de la Virgen'' (Great Festival of the Virgin) which takes place in December. The ''Fiesta Grande'', filled with colour, dancing and music performed by numerous [[Confraternity|confraternities]] and dance groups, is held at the Basilica of Our Lady of Andacollo. It starts each year on December 23 and lasts for at least five days, during which the statue is dressed in her crown and special clothes embroidered with gold, then carried in a solemn procession to the basilica accompanied by dance groups and pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingatlaschile.com/?s=The+Virgin+of+Andacollo The virgin of Andacollo, as Eduardo Huerta the priest in charge of the parish describe the celebrations] livingatlaschile.com, December 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a smaller festival, the ''Fiesta Chica'' (“small festival”), which takes place on the first Sunday of October.

'''Pablo Cesar Amaringo Shuña''' (1943 &amp;ndash; 16 November 2009) was a [[Peru]]vian artist, renowned for his intricate, colourful depictions of his visions from drinking the [[entheogen]]ic plant brew [[ayahuasca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lafosse|first=Lucy Ángulo|title=Pablo Amaringo: "Yo voy a volver?"|url=http://www.generaccion.com/usuarios/6981/pablo-amaringo-yo-voy-volver|newspaper=Generaccion|date=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was first brought to the West's attention by [[Dennis McKenna]] and [[Luis Eduardo Luna]], who met Pablo in [[Pucallpa]] while traveling during work on an ethnobotanical project. Pablo worked as a [[vegetalista]], a [[shaman]] in the [[mestizo]] tradition of healing, for many years; up to his death, he painted, helped run the Usko-Ayar school of painting, and supervised ayahuasca retreats.

Amaringo was born the seventh of thirteen children in 1943 in [[Puerto Libertad]], a small settlement on the banks of a tributary of the [[Ucayali River]]. When Amaringo was a boy, his family were reduced to extreme poverty after some years of relative prosperity. As a result, they moved to Pucallpa where Amaringo attended school for just two years before he was forced to find work to help support the family. When he was 17 Amaringo became extremely ill, nearly dying from severe heart problems. For over two years he could not work. He believes he was eventually cured due to a local healer.

It was while recovering from this illness that he started to draw and paint for the first time. Amaringo began making drawings with pencil and shading with soot from lamps. From a friend employed in a car factory he got permatex, a blue substance with which he coloured the drawings. He had no money for paper so he used cardboard boxes. Sometimes he took a little lipstick and other cosmetics from his sisters. Later he used ink, watercolours and then a friend gave him six tubes of oil paint.

Soon Amaringo began to make money from portraits, but lost his market when photographers began to colour black-green-and-white prints. With the discovery of his new artistic talent Amaringo's career as a healer also received exposure for all wonderful things. For seven years, 1970–76, he travelled extensively in the region acting as a traditional healer. Until one fatal day when he couldn't heal any more because he cared more about art than his fellows around him.

In 1977, Pablo abandoned his vocation as a shaman. He warns: "Ayahuasca is not something to play. It can even kill, not because it is toxic in itself, but because the body may not be able to withstand the spiritual realm, the vibrations of the spiritual world. "

He devoted himself to painting until becoming an art teacher at his school Usko Ayar (Usko in Quechua means "spiritual", and Ayar "prince"), where the students freely learned Pablo's painting technique.

When Luna and McKenna met Amaringo in 1985 he was living in poverty, barely surviving by teaching English to young people from his home and selling the odd painting to passing tourists. Luna suggested he paint some of his visions, a project which became the basis of a co-authored book, ''Ayahuasca Visions: The Religious Iconography of a Peruvian Shaman'' (North Atlantic Books 1999).&lt;!-- ISBN 1-55643-311-5 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erowid Character Vaults: Pablo Amaringo|url=http://www.erowid.org/culture/characters/amaringo_pablo/amaringo_pablo.shtml|work=Erowid|accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Amaringo|first=Pablo|title=Ayahuasca Visions|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/3716773/Ayahuasca-Visions-by-Shaman-Pablo-Amaringo|work=Scribd|accessdate=31 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115022515/http://www.scribd.com/doc/3716773/Ayahuasca-Visions-by-Shaman-Pablo-Amaringo|archivedate=15 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amaringo occasionally gave interviews in the years following the book's publication, and later penned the preface for ''Plant Spirit Shamanism: Traditional Techniques for Healing the Soul'' (Destiny Books 2006).&lt;!--  ISBN 1-59477-118-9 --&gt; His artwork was featured in [[Graham Hancock|Graham Hancock's]] book ''"Supernatural"''. Amaringo also appeared in ''The Shaman &amp; Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms'' (2010), Michael Wiese's documentary film about ayahuasca.

After a protracted illness, Amaringo died on 16 November 2009.

== Pablo C. Amaringo's Work in Popular Culture ==

=== His Art School ===
Until shortly before his death, Amaringo worked as a painter, reworking the visions he experienced during his shamanic practice, and at the same time teaching young people to paint at his art school, in Pucallpa, where he worked as a director and founder along with Luis Eduardo Luna in 1988.

This school is also dedicated to the teaching of the preservation of the ecosystems of the Amazonian area, work for which, during the Earth Conference that was held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, Pablo Amaringo was awarded the [[Global 500 Roll of Honour|Global 500 Roll of Honor]], granted by the United Nations environmental preservation program, for the work carried out by the institution led by him, and for the achievements made during these years of work. 

These are the objectives of the school: to foster in the youth, through artistic education, understanding and respect for the Amazonian environment, strengthen their cultural identity so that they can improve their living conditions.

Generate a great artistic documentation of the flora, fauna and cultural tradition of the Peruvian Amazon that can be used in scientific and popular publications and in the development of ethnobotanical gardens, near the two largest cities of the Peruvian Amazon (Pucallpa and Iquitos), and to preserve and promote traditional knowledge of useful and medicinal plants. To help develop the school as a cultural center, very necessary, where young people will have the opportunity to learn not only painting, but also theater, traditional dances and music, pottery and other crafts, to disseminate knowledge locally as an international- about the Amazonian nature, art and culture.

Before dying, he was working on the paintings of angels, as well as paintings documenting the flora and fauna of Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=www.visionchamanica.com|title=“Ayahuasca Visions”|last=Díaz Mayorga|first=Ricardo|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film ===

Pablo's work can be seen in the documentary film "[[www.thepathofthesun.com|Ayahuasca Nature's Greatest Gift]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thepathofthesun.com|title = The Path of the Sun|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;" which is part of a film series on shamanism, wisdom, consciousness and the medicinal plant [[Ayahuasca]] entitled [[www.thepathofthesun.com|The Path of the Sun]].

'''Padraic Colum''' (8 December 1881 – 11 January 1972) was an Irish poet, novelist, dramatist, biographer, playwright, children's author and [[folklore|collector of folklore]]. He was one of the leading figures of the [[Irish Literary Revival]].

==Early life==
[[File:Padraic Colum in the 1900s.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Portrait drawing of Colum by [[John Butler Yeats|John B. Yeats]], 1900s]]

Colum was born '''Patrick Columb''' in a [[County Longford]] workhouse, where his father worked. He was the first of eight children born to Patrick and Susan Columb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=30 April 2012 4:17:03 AM #.26# |url=http://www.poemhunter.com/padraic-colum |title=Biodata |publisher=Poemhunter.com |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the father lost his job in 1889, he moved to the United States to participate in the [[Colorado gold rush]]. Padraic and his mother and siblings remained in Ireland. When the father returned in 1892, the family moved to [[Glasthule]], near [[Dublin]], where his father was employed as Assistant Manager at [[Sandycove and Glasthule railway station]]. His son attended the local [[National school (Ireland)|national school]].

When Susan Columb died in 1897, the family was temporarily split up. Padraic (as he would be known) and one brother remained in Dublin, while their father and remaining children moved back to Longford. Colum finished school the following year and at the age of seventeen, he passed an exam for and was awarded a clerkship in the [[Irish Railway Clearing House]]. He stayed in this job until 1903.

During this period, Colum started to write and met a number of the leading Irish writers of the time, including [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Lady Gregory]] and [[George William Russell|Æ]]. He also joined the [[Gaelic League]] and was a member of the first board of the [[Abbey Theatre]]. He became a regular user of the [[National Library of Ireland]], where he met [[James Joyce]] and the two became lifelong friends. During the riots caused by the Abbey Theatre's production of ''[[The Playboy of the Western World]]'', Padraic Colum's father, Patrick Columb, was one of the protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/synge-s-opening-night-to-remember-1.1291816|title=Synge's opening night to remember|newspaper=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Padraic himself was not engaged in the protests, although he did pay his father's fine afterwards.

He collected Irish folk songs, and sometimes rewrote them almost in their entirety, including the famous ''[[She Moved Through the Fair]]''. Colum based his poem on one surviving line, while his collaborator, the musicologist [[Herbert Hughes (musicologist)|Herbert Hughes]] noted the tune.&lt;ref&gt;"SHE MOVED THROUGH THE FAIR". (9 April 1970). ''The Irish Times''&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a five-year scholarship by a wealthy American benefactor, Thomas Hughes Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/libraries/newsletter/2014spring/colum.html|title=Boston College Libraries Newsletter - Spring 2014|last=chrishp|website=www.bc.edu|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used it to read, study and write. He did not attend University College Dublin, or any other University as a student.

==Early poetry and plays==
He was awarded a prize by [[Cumann na nGaedheal (1900)|Cumann na nGaedheal]] for his anti-enlistment play, ''The Saxon Shillin'''. Through his plays he became involved with the National Theatre Society and became involved in the founding of the [[Abbey Theatre]], writing several of its early productions. His first play, ''Broken Soil'' (revised as The Fiddler's House) (1903) was performed by [[W. G. Fay's Irish National Dramatic Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Fay: The Fays of the Abbey Theatre. 1935. p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Land'' (1905), was one of that theatre's first great public successes. He wrote another important play for the Abbey named ''Thomas Muskerry'' (1910).

His earliest published poems appeared in ''The United Irishman'', a paper edited by [[Arthur Griffith]]. His first book, ''Wild Earth'' (1907) collected many of these poems and was dedicated to Æ. He published several poems in [[Arthur Griffith]]'s paper, ''[[The United Irishman]]'' this time, with ''The Poor Scholar'' bringing him to the attention of [[William Butler Yeats|WB Yeats]]. He became a friend of Yeats and [[Augusta, Lady Gregory|Lady Gregory]].  In 1908, he wrote an introduction to the [[Everyman's Library]] edition of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]''.

In 1911, with [[Mary Colum|Mary Gunning Maguire]], a student from UCD, and David Houston and [[Thomas MacDonagh]], he founded the short-lived literary journal ''The Irish Review'', which published work by Yeats, [[George A.

In 1912 he married Maguire. Padraic taught at [[Pádraig Pearse]]'s experimental school, [[St. Enda's School|Scoil Éanna]] in Rathfarnham, County Dublin and Mary Maguire taught at the girls' school, Scoil Íde or St. Ita's, which was set up in Cullenswood House, Ranelagh, Dublin, once Scoil Éanna had moved to Rathfarnham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://limerick100.wordpress.com/2014/10/16/i-care-not-if-my-life-has-only-the-span-of-a-night-and-a-day-if-my-deeds-be-spoken-of-by-the-men-of-ireland-padraic-colums-thoughts-on-pearse-and-macdonagh-1916/|title=Spotlight: Padraic Colum’s thoughts on Pearse and MacDonagh (1916)|last=@Limerick1914 in Art, Education, Politics, Religion, Spotlight|first=|date=16 October 2014|website=History is what we choose to remember Researching Limerick 100 years ago, Slavery, Memory, Power|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first the couple lived in the Dublin suburb of [[Donnybrook, Dublin|Donnybrook]], where they held a regular Tuesday literary salon. They then moved to [[Howth]], a small fishing village just to the north of the capital. In 1914, they travelled to the US for what was intended to be a visit of a few months but lasted most the rest of their lives.

==Later life and work==
In America, Colum took up children's writing and published a number of collections of stories for children, beginning with ''[[The King of Ireland's Son]]'' (1916). This book came about when Colum started translating an Irish folk tale from [[Irish language|Gaelic]] because he did not want to forget the language. After it was published in the [[New York Tribune]], Hungarian Illustrator [[Willy Pogany]] suggested the possibility of a book collaboration, so Colum wove the folktale into a long, epic story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Critical History of Children's Literature |last=Viguers |first=Ruth Hill |authorlink= |author2=Cornelia Meigs (ed.) |year=1969 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing co. |location= |isbn=0-02-583900-4 |page=426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of his books for children were awarded retrospective citations for the [[Newbery Honor]]. A contract for children's literature with [[Macmillan Publishers]] made him financially secure for the rest of his life. Some other books he wrote are ''The Adventure of Odysseus'' (1918) and ''The Children of Odin'' (1920). These works are important for bringing classical literature to children.

In 1922 he was commissioned to write versions of Hawaiian folklore for young people. This resulted in the publication of three volumes of his versions of tales from the islands. At the suggestion of Dr Pádraic Whyte (School of English, Trinity College Dublin) a first edition of the first volume (''At the Gateways of the Day'') was presented to US president Barack Obama by Taoiseach Enda Kenny on the occasion of his visit to Dublin, Ireland on 23 May 2011.&lt;ref name="IT28May2011"&gt;{{cite web

The Colums spent the years from 1930 to 1933 living in Paris and [[Nice]], where Padraic renewed his friendship with [[James Joyce]] and became involved in the transcription of ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.

After their time in France, the couple moved to New York City, where they did some teaching at [[Columbia University]] and [[CCNY]]. Colum was a prolific author and published a total of 61 books, not counting his plays. He adopted the form of [[Noh]] drama in his later plays.

While in New York, he wrote the screenplay for the 1954 stop-motion animated film [[Hansel and Gretel: An Opera Fantasy|Hansel and Gretel]].  It was his only screenplay. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0173365/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary died in 1957 and Padraic finished ''Our Friend James Joyce'', which they had worked on together. It was published in 1958. Colum divided his later years between the United States and Ireland. In 1961 the Catholic Library Association awarded him the [[Regina Medal]]. He died in [[Enfield, Connecticut]], age 90, and was buried in [[St. Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton]].

In 1965, Colum sold the notebooks, manuscripts, galley proofs, and letters that were in his apartments in New York and Dublin to the [[Binghamton University|Binghamton University Libraries]].  He wished to make whatever resources he could available to scholars of Irish literature and history.&lt;ref&gt;http://slipknot.binghamton.edu/?p=collections/findingaid&amp;id=5746&amp;q=&amp;rootcontentid=38960&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked how to say his name, he told ''The [[Literary Digest]]'' the last name was the same as the word ''column''. "In my first name, the first ''a'' has the sound of ''au''.  The ordinary pronunciation in Irish is ''pau'drig''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Earle Funk]], ''What's the Name, Please?'', Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raskol''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|раскол}}, {{IPA-ru|rɐˈskoɫ|pron}}, meaning "split" or "[[schism]]") was the splitting of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] into an official church and the [[Old Believers]] movement in the mid-17th century. It was triggered by the reforms of [[Patriarch Nikon]] in 1653, which aimed to establish uniformity between Greek and Russian church practices.

==The Raskol&amp;nbsp;– result of Church reforms==
The members of an influential circle called the [[Zealots of Piety]] (Russian: Кружок ревнителей благочестия ''Kruzhok revnitelei blagochestiya'') stood for purification of Russian Orthodox faith. They strove to reform [[Muscovy|Muscovite]] society, bringing it into closer accordance with Christian values and to improve church practices. As a consequence, they also were engaged in the removal of alternative versions and correction of [[Divine Service (Eastern Orthodoxy)|divine service]] books. The most influential members of this circle were [[Archpriest]]s [[Avvakum]], [[Ivan Neronov]], [[Stephan Vonifatiyev]], [[Fyodor Rtishchev]] and, when still [[Archbishop of Novgorod]], Nikon himself, the future Patriarch.

With the support from the Russian [[Tsar]] [[Alexei Mikhailovich]], Patriarch Nikon began the process of correction of the Russian divine service books in accordance with their modern Greek counterparts and changed some of the rituals (the two-finger [[sign of the cross]] was replaced by the one with three fingers, "[[hallelujah]]" was to be pronounced three times instead of two etc.). These innovations met with resistance from both the clergy and the people, who disputed the legitimacy and correctness of these reforms, referring to theological traditions and Eastern Orthodox ecclesiastic rules. Ignoring these protests, the reforms were approved by the church [[Synod#Orthodox usage|sobor]]s in 1654–1655. In 1653–1656, the [[Print Yard]] under [[Epifany Slavinetsky]] began to produce corrected versions of newly translated divine service books.

A traditional, widespread view of these reforms is that they only affected the external ritualistic side of the Russian Orthodox faith and that these changes were deemed a major event by the religious [[Russian people]]. However, these reforms, apart from their arbitrariness, established radically different relations between the church and the faithful. It soon became obvious that Nikon had used this reform for the purpose of centralization of the church and strengthening of his own authority. Nikon's forcible introduction of the new divine service books and rituals caused a major estrangement between the Zealots of Piety and Nikon. Some of its members stood up for the old faith and opposed the reforms and patriarch's actions.

Avvakum and Daniel petitioned to the tsar in favour of the two-finger sign of the cross and [[Bowing (social)|bow]]s during divine services and [[sermon]]s. Then, they tried to prove to the clergy that the correction of the books in accordance with the Greek standards profaned the pure faith because the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Church]] had deviated from the "ancient piety" and had been printing its divine service books in [[Catholic]] print houses and that they had been exposed to Roman Catholic influences. Ivan Neronov spoke against the strengthening of patriarch's authority and demanded [[democratization]] of ecclesiastic management. This conflict between Nikon and defenders of the old faith took a turn for the worse and soon Avvakum, Ivan Neronov and others would be persecuted and eventually executed in 1682.

[[File:Boyaryna Morozova by V.Surikov (1884-1887, Tretyakov gallery).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Detail of the painting ''Boyarynya Morozova'' by [[Vasily Surikov]] depicting the arrest of [[Feodosia Morozova]] by the [[Patriarch Nikon|Nikonians]] in 1671. She holds two fingers raised, thus showing the old way of making the [[Sign of the Cross]]: with two fingers, rather than with three.]]

The case brought by the defenders of the old faith found many supporters among different strata of the Russian society, which would give birth to the Raskol movement. A part of the old faith low-ranking clergy protested against the increase of [[feudal]] oppression, coming from the church leaders. Some members of the high-ranking clergy joined the Raskol movement due to their discontent over Nikon's aspirations and the arbitrariness of his church reforms.

Some of them, such as Bishop [[Paul of Kolomna]], Archbishop [[Alexander of Vyatka]] (as well as a number of monasteries, such as the famous [[Solovetsky Monastery]]), stood up for the old faith; bishop Paul was eventually executed for his loyalty to the old rites. Boyarynya [[Feodosiya Morozova]], her sister Princess Urusova, and some other courtiers openly supported or secretly sympathized with the defenders of the old faith.  

The unification of such [[heterogeneous]] forces against what had become "the official church" could probably be explained by the somewhat contradictory ideology of the Raskol movement. A certain idealization and conservation of traditional values and old traditions, a critical attitude towards innovations, conservation of national originality and acceptance (by radical elements) of [[martyrdom]] in the name of the old faith as the only way towards [[salvation]] were intertwined with criticism of feudalism and [[serfdom]]. Different social strata were attracted to different sides of this ideology.

The most radical apologists of the Raskol preached about approaching [[Armageddon]] and coming of the [[Antichrist]], Tsar's and patriarch's worshiping of [[Satan]], which ideas would find a broad response among the Russian people, sympathizing with the ideology of these most radical apologetes. The Raskol movement thus became a vanguard of the conservative and at the same time democratic opposition.

== Uprisings and persecution ==
The Raskol movement gained in strength after the [[Moscow Sobor of 1666–1667|church sobor in 1666–67]], which had [[Anathema|anathemized]] the defenders of the old faith as [[heresy|heretic]]s and made decisions with regards to their punishment. Especially members of the low-ranking clergy, who had severed their relations with the church, became the leaders of the opposition. Propagation of the split with the church in the name of preservation of the Orthodox faith as it had existed until the reforms was the main postulate of their ideology. The most dramatic manifestations of the Raskol included the practice of the so-called ''ognenniye kreshcheniya'' (огненные крещения, or [[baptism]] by fire), or [[self-immolation]], practiced by the most radical elements in the Old Believers' movement, who thought that the end of the world was near. 

[[Image:Meshcherinov.jpg|thumb|300px|''A Muscovite [[Voivode]] Putting Down the [[Solovetsky Monastery uprising]]''. An early 19th-century hand-drawn [[lubok]], attributed to Mikhail Grigoriev.]]
The Old Believers would soon split into different denominations, the [[Popovtsy]] and the [[Bespopovtsy]]. Attracted to the preachings of the Raskol ideologists, many [[posad]] people, mainly peasants, craftsmen and cossacks fled to the dense forests of Northern Russia and [[Volga]] region, southern borders of Russia, [[Siberia]], and even abroad, where they would organize their own [[obshchina]]s.  This was a mass exodus of common Russian people, who had refused to follow the new ecclesiastic rituals. In 1681, the government noted an increase among the "enemies of the church", especially in Siberia. With active support from the Russian Orthodox Church, it began to persecute the so-called ''raskolniki'' (раскольники), i.e., "schism-makers". 

In the 1670s–1680s, the exposure of certain social vices in the Russian society gained special importance in the Raskol ideology. Some of the Raskol apologetes, such as Avvakum and his brothers-in-exile at the [[Pustozyorsk]] prison, tended to justify some of the uprisings, interpreting them as God's punishment of the ecclesiastic and tsarist authorities for their actions.  Some of the supporters of the Old Believers took part in [[Stepan Razin]]'s rebellion in 1670–1671, although this uprising is not regarded as an Old Believers' rebellion and Stenka Razin himself had strongly antiecclesiastic views. The supporters of the old faith played an important role in the [[Moscow uprising of 1682]].  Many of the members of the old faith migrated west, seeking refuge in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which [[Warsaw Compact|allowed them]] to practice their faith freely .

In the late 17th – early 18th century, the most radical elements of the Raskol movement went into recession after it had become obvious that the reforms could not be reversed. The internal policy of [[Peter I of Russia| Peter the Great]] eased the persecution of the Old Believers. The Tsar, however, did impose higher taxes on them. During the reign of Cathеrine the Great, Old Believers who had fled abroad were even encouraged to return to their motherland. However, the position of Old Believers in Russia remained illegal until 1905.
[[File:Vo vremena raskola by S.V.Ivanov.jpg|thumb|A scene from the times of the Raskol, by [[Sergey Ivanov (painter)|Sergey Ivanov]]]]

The Raskol (schism) still exists, and with it a certain antagonism between the Russian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate and the Old Believers, although on an official level both sides have agreed on a peaceful coexistence.  From an ecclesiastic and theological point of view the Raskol remains a highly controversial question and one of the most tragic episodes of Russian history.

'''Ratu Bagus''' (born '''I Ketut Widnya''', November 1949) is a Balinese [[guru]] who developed the technique of Bio-energy Shaking Meditation. He is said to [[Shaktipat|transmit healing energy]] through his touch and  picture, which induces spontaneous shaking and laughing in the recipient, releasing them of mental, physical, emotional and spiritual blocks. By training in Bio-energy Shaking Meditation, many people claim to have overcome alcohol and drug dependency, and to have healed many kinds of illnesses and tumours.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metro.co.uk/lifestyle/280264-celebrate-the-wonders-of-meditation&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratu Bagus, which means 'Good King', was born into a poor family of nine children. As a young man his ambition was to become soldier as he was drawn to a disciplined way of life.  However, after several unsuccessful attempts to join the army, he moved to Jakarta where he became a private officer at a transportation firm and later back to Bali where he became a government officer.

After many years he felt the need to be closer to nature and decided to become a farmer on a plantation at the base of the sacred [[Mount Agung]].  As time went by his spiritual aspirations intensified and he began meditating regularly at various sacred sites within Bali. Then one day he experienced a revelation on the slopes of Mount Agung, which left him feeling that his mission was now to help the suffering of humanity. Soon after this he began to form his [[ashram]].

Ratu’s following in the West has steadily grown and shaking groups now exist all over Europe and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ratubagus.com/English/Ratu+Bagus/About+Ratu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/alternativemedicine/3354971/Shaking-Meditation-all-shook-up.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religion in [[Sweden]]''' is diversified. [[Christianity]] was the religion of virtually all of the Swedish population from the 12th to the early 20th century, but it has rapidly declined throughout the late 20th and early 21st century. In 2015, legally registered Christians comprised 69.9% of the total population.&lt;ref name="statistik2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="svenskakyrkan stats" /&gt;

The [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Church of Sweden]] — which was the [[state religion]] until 2000 — has a registered membership of 6.0 million Swedish citizens as of 2017, equal to 59.3% of the total population.&lt;ref name="svenskakyrkan stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.svenskakyrkan.se/statistik|title=Svenska kyrkan i siffror|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Church of Sweden (''Svenska kyrkan'')|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the high membership might be the fact that until 1996 all newborns with at least one parent being a member of the Church of Sweden were also registered as members of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1995/1004/04061.html|title=Sweden Snaps Strong Ties Between Church and State|author=Wendy Sloane|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|date=1995-10-04|accessdate=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the membership is declining rapidly, about 1% each year, for the most recent years even 2%, falling from 95% in 1970 and 85% in 2000.

Prior to their [[Christianisation]] that became complete around the 12th century, the Swedes practised forms of [[Norse religion]]. At first they became part of the Catholic Church; then, from the 1530s, Sweden switched to [[Lutheranism]] as part of the [[Protestant Reformation]] which converted most of [[Germanic Europe]]; the Church of Sweden was formed and remained the [[Christian state|official religion of the Christian state]] until the turn of the 21st century. The 21st century brought with itself a rapid decline of Christianity overall, the disestablishment of the Church of Sweden, and the modest growth of other religions, often brought by waves of [[immigration]] from outside the country. These last include [[Islam]], Catholicism, Orthodox Christianity, [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and other [[Eastern religions]].

==History==

===Historical Norse religion===
[[File:Gamla uppsala.jpg|thumb|[[Gamla Uppsala]], the centre of worship in Sweden until the temple was destroyed in the late 11th century.]]
Before the 11th century, Swedes practised [[Norse religion]], worshipping a variety of [[list of Germanic deities|Germanic deities]]. An important religious centre was the [[Temple at Uppsala]]. The shape and location of this temple is sparsely documented, but it is referenced in the [[Norse saga]]s and Saxo Grammaticus' ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', and is also described by [[Adam of Bremen]]. It was probably destroyed by King [[Ingold I]] in 1087 during the last known battle between the pagans and the Christians.

While Norse religion was officially abandoned with the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]], belief in many spirits of [[Norse mythology]] such as [[nisse (folklore)|tomtar]], [[troll]]s, [[elf|elves]] and [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]] lived on for a long time in [[Scandinavian folklore]].

===9th–12th century: Conversion to Catholicism===
[[File:Vadstena kloster från luften.jpg|thumb|The historical [[Vadstena Abbey]] of the Catholic order of the [[Bridgettines]], founded by [[Bridget of Sweden]].]]
{{main article|Christianization of Sweden}}
The oldest evidence of Christian burial sites in Sweden are dated to the 6th century, but they are very few in number. The earliest documented campaign to Christianise the Swedes was made by the monk [[Ansgar]] (801–865). Making his first visit to [[Birka]] in 828–829, he was granted permission to build a church. In 831, he returned home and became [[Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]], with responsibility for Christianity in the north. Around 850, he came back to Birka, where the original congregation had been shattered. Ansgar tried to reestablish it, but it only lasted a few years.

Christianity first gained a hold in [[Västergötland]], probably due to mercantile ties to the Christian Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in England. Remnants of a 9th-century church building has recently been excavated in Varnhem. The diocese of Skara, which is the oldest diocese in Sweden, emerged under the Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen, in the late 10th century. According to [[Adam of Bremen]], the Christian king [[Olof Skötkonung]], who ruled from c. 995 to c. 1022 was forced to limit Christian activities to the western province. When [[Stenkil of Sweden|King Stenkil]] ascended to the throne in 1060 Christianity was firmly established throughout most of Sweden, although the people of [[Uppland]], and probably Sodermanland, resisted the new religion.

The last king adhering to the old religion was [[Blot-Sweyn]], who reigned 1084–1087. A handful of local saints (canonized on diocesan level before the centralized process became normative in 1170–1200), [[folk saints]] and clerics were allegedly martyred as late as the 1120s, most of them in Sodermanland and Uppland. Under the reign of [[Eric IX of Sweden|Eric the Saint]] (1150–1160) Christianity became an ideological factor of the state, and the [[First Swedish Crusade]] took place; it was a military expedition aimed at converting the [[Finns]] to Christianity and conquering [[Finland]] as Swedish territory. (However, no archeological data or written sources seem to support the legend. The diocese and bishop of Finland are not listed among their Swedish counterparts before the 1250s). A national church of Sweden was not organized until 1164, when the first archbishop of Uppsala received his pallium from the archbishop of Lund.

Pre-Reformation Swedish Catholic religious leaders — including [[Bridget of Sweden]], founder of the continuously functioning Catholic [[Vadstena Abbey]] — continue to be held in high regard by the population as a whole. Her nunnery at Vadstena is one of Sweden's pre-eminent tourist attractions.

===16th century: Protestant Reformation; conversion to Lutheranism===
[[File:Alvastra kloster - KMB - 16000300037888.jpg|thumb|Ruins of Alvastra Monastery in [[Ödeshög]]. Various ruined medieval Catholic monasteries such as this one stand as testimonies of the appropriation of Catholic properties by the Swedish state during the Protestant Reformation.]]
{{Main article|Swedish Reformation}}
Shortly after [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] was elected king in 1523, he asked the [[Pope]] to confirm [[Johannes Magnus]] as [[Archbishop of Sweden]], replacing [[Gustav Trolle]], who had supported the Danish king [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]] and was convicted for treason. When the Pope refused, Gustav Vasa — he himself a proponent of a "Renaissance Biblical Humanism" — started to promote the Swedish [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] reformers [[Olaus Petri|Olaus]], [[Laurentius Petri]], and [[Laurentius Andreae]]. Gustav Trolle was eventually forced into exile, and soon all ecclesiastical property was transferred to the Crown. In 1531, Laurentius Petri was appointed by the Crown to become the first Lutheran primate of Sweden, and was ordained by five Catholic bishops without papal assent. The ties with Rome were irreversibly cut in 1536, when [[Canon Law]] was abolished.

Originally, no changes were made to official church doctrine, and the episcopal organization was retained. Gradually, in spite of popular protests against the introduction of "Luthery", teachings were aligned with continental Lutheranism. Calvinism was, otherwise, refuted as heresy at the synod of Stockholm in 1565. In order to appease [[the Holy See]], king [[John III of Sweden]], one of Gustav Vasa's sons, took measures to bring the Church of Sweden to a theological position influenced by [[George Cassander]], but, in the heat of controversy, such a compromise position did not achieve its intent of reunion. However, after his death, his brother, [[Charles IX of Sweden|Duke Charles]], summoned the [[Uppsala Synod]] in 1593, which declared [[the Holy Scriptures]] the sole guideline for faith, with four documents accepted as faithful and authoritative explanations of it: the [[Apostles' Creed]], the [[Nicene Creed]], the [[Athanasian Creed]], and the unaltered [[Augsburg Confession]] of 1530.&lt;ref&gt;N.F. ''Lutheran Cyclopedia'', article, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=93ErAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA528&amp;vq=%22Upsala+The+Diet+of%22#PRA1-PA529,M1 Upsala, Diet of]", New York: Schrivner, 1899. p. 528–29.&lt;/ref&gt; The Uppsala Synod also reinstated The Swedish Church Ordinance of 1572, which remained in use until 1686.

The move put Charles at odds with the heir to the throne, his nephew [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund]], who was raised in the Catholic faith. Although Sigismund promised to uphold Lutheranism, Duke Charles's aspirations to power led to the [[War against Sigismund]], a power struggle that was effectively decided at the [[Battle of Stångebro]] in 1598, in favour of Charles and [[Protestantism]].

During the era following the [[Protestant Reformation]], usually known as the period of [[Lutheran Orthodoxy]], small groups of non-Lutherans, especially Calvinist [[Dutch people|Dutchmen]], the [[Moravian Church]] and [[Walloon immigration to Sweden|Walloon immigrants]] from the [[Southern Netherlands]], played a significant role in trade and industry, and were quietly tolerated as long as they kept a low profile.

===17th–18th century: Conversion of the Sami and freedom for Christian minorities===
The [[Sami people|Sami]], who originally had their own shamanistic religion, were converted to Lutheranism by Swedish missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries. Citizens of foreign nations, mainly Russians, were granted freedom to practice Eastern Orthodox Christianity since the [[Treaty of Stolbovo]] in 1617. Anglican and Calvinist foreigners were granted freedom to practice their religions in Stockholm (1741) and Gothenburg (1747). Similar liberties were granted Catholics in 1781, and an apostolic vicar was sent to Sweden in 1783.

===18th–19th century: Crackdown on Pietism and enforcement of Lutheranism===
In order to curb [[Pietism]] several royal decrees and parliament acts were issued in the 18th century; they forbade Swedish citizens to practice any religion besides mandatory Lutheran Sunday mass and daily family devotions. Without the presence of a Lutheran clergyman public religious gatherings were forbidden. It remained illegal until 1860 for Lutheran Swedes to convert to another confession or religion.

===19th–20th century: Liberalisation of all religions===
In 1860 it became legal to leave the Church of Sweden for the purpose of becoming a member of another officially recognised religious denomination. From 1951, it became legal to leave the church, without providing any reason. From 1951 to 1977 all religious institutions could only be established with the permission of the Crown.

The constitution of Sweden provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respects this right in practice. The government at all levels seeks to protect this right in full and does not tolerate its abuse, either by governmental or private actors. The rights and freedoms enumerated in the constitution include the rights to practice one's religion and protection of religious freedom. The laws concerning religious freedoms are generally observed and enforced at all government levels and by the courts in a non-discriminatory fashion. Legal protections cover discrimination or persecution by private actors.&lt;ref name=irf&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127339.htm|title=International Religious Freedom Report 2006 - Sweden|date=October 26, 2009|publisher=U.S. Department of State - Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|accessdate=2010-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s about 85% of Swedes still belonged to the Church of Sweden. By the end of 2017, this figure had fallen to 59.3%.&lt;ref name="svenskakyrkan stats"/&gt; The percentage of Swedes belonging to the Church of Sweden is decreasing yearly by more than one percent. In the year 2016, according to an online survey held among about 500 working-age, internet connected people in Sweden, only 24% of the participants claim to believe in Protestantism.&lt;ref name="Ipsos2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ipsosglobaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Slide13-6.jpg|title=Religion, Ipsos Global Trends|date=2017|publisher=[[Ipsos]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905105138/https://www.ipsosglobaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Slide13-6.jpg|archive-date=5 September 2017}} See also [https://www.ipsosglobaltrends.com/about/ About Ipsos Global Trends survey] for limitations of this survey&lt;/ref&gt; 45% of the participants claim not to have any religious or spiritual belief, of whom 33% are [[atheism|atheists]] and 13% are [[agnosticism|agnostics]]. 13% say that [[spiritual but not religious|they hold spiritual beliefs but they are not religious]]. Immigration and conversion has brought into Sweden a variety of religions from the East, including [[Islam]] (3%) and [[Buddhism]] (1%), but also new populations of [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] (4%), and [[Orthodox Christianity]] (3%).&lt;ref name="Ipsos2017"/&gt;

Eight recognized religious denominations, in addition to the Church of Sweden, raise revenues through member-contributions made through the national tax system. All recognized denominations are entitled to direct government financial support, contributions made through the national tax system, or a mix of both. Certain Christian holidays are national holidays. School students from minority religious backgrounds are entitled to take relevant religious holidays.&lt;ref name=irf/&gt; No recognition or registration is required to carry out religious activity. Religious groups that want to receive government aid may apply for it.&lt;ref name=irf/&gt;

Education about all major world religions is compulsory in public schools. Parents may send their children to religious [[charter school]]s, all of which receive [[school voucher]]s, provided they adhere to government guidelines on core academic curriculum.&lt;ref name=irf/&gt; The Office of the [[Ombudsman]] against Ethnic Discrimination investigates claims of discrimination "due to race, skin color, national or ethnic origin, or religion". Discrimination on religious grounds is illegal, including discrimination in the work place and in the provision of public and private services.&lt;ref name=irf/&gt;

=== Surveys ===

* In 2017, the [[Pew Research Center]] found in their ''Global Attitutes Survey'' that 59.9% of the Swedes regarded themselves as Christians, with 48.7% belonging to the Church of Sweden, 9.5% were Unaffiliated Christians, 0.7% were Pentecostal Protestants, 0.4% were Catholics, the Eastern Orthodox and the Congregationalist were the 0.3% each. Unaffiliated people were the 35.0% divided in 18.8% Atheists, 11.9% nothing in particular and 4.3% Agnostics.

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhism in Sweden}}
[[File:Buddharama Tempel 03.jpg|thumb|Buddharama Temple in [[Torsby]].]]
In 2014, there were 4,812 formal affiliated [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] in Sweden, comprising 0.05% of the total population. A 2016 survey by [[Ipsos]] based on 500 working-age, internet connected Swedes, found that 1% of the respondents declared to be Buddhists.&lt;ref name="Ipsos2017"/&gt;

===Christianity===

In 2015 there were 6,886,501 formal affiliated Christians in Sweden, comprising 69.9% of the total population.&lt;ref name="statistik2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="svenskakyrkan stats" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Survey results are various, for example, according to a 2016 [[Ipsos]] survey, only 32% of the approximately 500 working-age, internet connected participants claimed to belong to [[Christianity]], and among them 24% belong to [[Protestantism]], 4% to [[Catholicism]], 3% to [[Orthodox Christianity]] and 1% to the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].&lt;ref name="Ipsos2017" /&gt; Another survey by the [[Pew Research Center]] found in Spring 2016 that 66.7% out of a sample of 1,000 Swedes claimed to be [[Christian]]s.&lt;ref name="spring2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/dataset/spring-2016-survey-data/|title=Spring 2016 Survey Data {{!}} Pew Research Center|website=www.pewglobal.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protestantism====
As of 2015, 6,601,113 people, or 67% of the total population, were registered members of the various [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] in Sweden.&lt;ref name="statistik2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="svenskakyrkan stats" /&gt;

=====Church of Sweden=====
{{main article|Church of Sweden}}
The Church of Sweden ({{lang-sv|Svenska kyrkan}}) is the largest Christian church in Sweden, and also the largest religious body. The church professes the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] faith and is a member of the [[Porvoo Communion]]. As of 2017 it has 5,993,368 members, 59.3% of the Swedish population,&lt;ref name="svenskakyrkan stats"/&gt; although surveys show different figures, ranging from 24%&lt;ref name="Ipsos2017"/&gt; to 41%&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf|title=Discrimination in the EU in 2012 – Special Eurobarometer 393 (The question asked was "Do you consider yourself to be...?")|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 52.1%.&lt;ref name="spring2016" /&gt; {{not in source|date=March 2018}} Until 2000 it held the position of [[state religion]], and most Swedes were baptised at birth. The number of both new baptisms and members has declined since. Indeed, according to official statistics, as of 2016:
* About 4 out of 10 (42.4%) children are christened in the Church of Sweden.&lt;ref name="SK2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.svenskakyrkan.se/default.aspx?id=1763870|title=Döpta, konfirmerade, vigda och begravda enligt Svenska kyrkans ordning år 1970-2017|publisher=Church of Sweden (''Svenska kyrkan'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* About 1 out of 3 (31.6%) weddings take place in church.&lt;ref name="SK2017"/&gt;
* About 3 out of 4 (72.9%) Swedes have Christian burials.&lt;ref name="SK2017"/&gt;

The Church of Sweden, by law,&lt;ref&gt;[http://riksdagen.se/webbnav/index.aspx?nid=3911&amp;bet=1998:1591 "SFS 1998:1591"], Riksdagen&lt;/ref&gt; is organized in the following manner:
*It is an Evangelical Lutheran community of faith manifested in [[parish]]es and [[diocese]]s. The church also has a national organisation.
*It is an open national church which, working with a [[democracy|democratic]] organisation and through the ministry of the church, covers the whole nation.
*The [[primate (bishop)|primate]] of the Church of Sweden is the [[Archbishop of Uppsala]].

=====Protestant free churches=====
The 19th century saw the arrival of various [[low church|evangelical]] [[free church]]es, and, towards the end of the century [[secularism]], leading many to distance themselves from church rituals. Leaving the [[Church of Sweden]] became legal with the so-called Dissenter Law of 1860, but only under the provision of entering another denomination. The right to stand outside any religious denomination was established in the law on [[freedom of religion]] in 1951.

Today, the [[Swedish Free Church Council]] ({{lang-sv|Sveriges Frikyrkosamråd}}) organizes free churches in Sweden, belonging to various Protestant denominations: [[Calvinist]], [[Pentecostal]], and others. In total the member churches have around 250,000 members. [[Baptists]], [[Methodist]]s and the [[Mission Covenant Church of Sweden]] merged in 2011 into a new denomination: the [[Uniting Church in Sweden]]. It is the largest member church in the Swedish Free Church Council, with approximately 65,000 members. One of the Baptist denominations, the [[Evangelical Free Church in Sweden]], has remained an independent denomination outside this merger.

====Catholic Church====
{{main article|Catholic Church in Sweden}}
Most Catholics in Sweden are of [[Slavs|Slavic]] (especially [[Poles]] and [[Croats]]), [[South America]]n or [[Middle East]]ern (especially [[Assyria]]n) origin.

As of 2015, legally registered Catholics in Sweden were 113,053,&lt;ref name="statistik2015" /&gt; comprising 1.2% of the total population. According to [[Ipsos]], in 2016 [[Catholic Church]] in Sweden account for 4% of the working-age, internet connected population,&lt;ref name="Ipsos2017" /&gt; while the [[Pew Research Center]] found a percentage of 1.2% in April 2016.&lt;ref name="spring2016" /&gt;

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
According to the ''2015 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', there are 22,730 active members in Sweden, and 36,270 people attended their annual [[Jehovah's Witnesses practices#Memorial of Christ's death|memorial of Christ's death]]. This number includes active members and guests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jw.org/en/publications/books/?contentLanguageFilter=en&amp;pubFilter=yb12&amp;sortBy=1 ''2012 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'']. JW.org. Retrieved January 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, 1% of the working-age, internet connected population of Sweden declared to be Jehovah's Witnesses.&lt;ref name="Ipsos2017"/&gt;

====Orthodox Christianity====
Multiple Orthodox jurisdictions exist in Sweden, including but not limited to the Greek and Serbian Orthodox Churches. There is also a substantial presence of Coptic and Ethiopian Christians. The [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] has several parishes in Sweden, under jurisdiction of [[Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Britain and Scandinavia]]. The [[Archdiocese of the Goths and the Northlands|Church of the Goths]] has a presence in [[Gotland]]. As of 2015, legally registered [[Eastern Orthodox Christians]] were 140,275 and they were the second-largest Christian sect in Sweden, comprising the 1.4% of the total population. A 2016 survey found that 3% of the working-age, internet connected population of Sweden declared to be Orthodox Christians.&lt;ref name="Ipsos2017"/&gt;

===Germanic Heathenism===
[[File:SAs årsting 2008-04-26 blot Ale stenar.jpg|thumb|Members of Forn Sed Sweden holding a [[blót|sacrifice]].]]
{{Main|Heathenry (new religious movement)}}
Germanic Heathenry, the contemporary continuation of ancient Germanic religion, is represented by various organizations, including the [[Nordic Society of the Ese]] (''Nordiska Asa-samfundet''), the [[Swedish Forn Sed Assembly]] (''Samfundet Forn Sed Sverige'') and the [[Community for Nordic Faith]] (''Samfälligheten för Nordisk Sed''). The Nordic Society of the Ese, despite being the most recently founded amongst the three (it was founded in 2013), has quickly grown to become the largest Heathen organization in Sweden.&lt;ref name=Dagen&gt;Jacob Zetterman.

===Islam===
[[File:Stockholms moské (gabbe).jpg|thumb|[[Stockholm Mosque]].]]
{{main article|Islam in Sweden}}
[[Islam]] entered Sweden primarily through immigration from countries with large Muslim populations (such as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Turkey]], [[Iraq]], [[Morocco]], [[Iran]], and [[Somalia]] ) in the late 20th century. The [[Baltic Tatars]] were the first Muslim group in modern Sweden.

In 2009 it was estimated that there were 450,000 to 500,000 Muslims in Sweden, around 5% of the total population,&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127339.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2009 : Sweden], U.S. Department Of State.&lt;/ref&gt; while there were only 139,759 formally affiliated Muslims in 2015.&lt;ref name="statistik2015" /&gt; As of 2016, 3% of the working-age, internet connected population of Sweden claimed to be believers in Islam.&lt;ref name="Ipsos2017"/&gt;

===Judaism===
[[File:Malmö synagoga 2.jpg|thumb|[[Malmö Synagogue]].]]
{{main article|History of the Jews in Sweden}}
The Official Council of Swedish Jewish Communities estimates about 20,000 [[ethnic Jews]] in Sweden by [[Halakha|halakhic]] criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judiskacentralradet.se/html/antal_judar.php "Antal judar"]. ''Judiska Centralrådet'' (in Swedish).&lt;/ref&gt; Of them, about 8,302 were members of a Jewish religious congregation in 2015.&lt;ref name="statistik2015" /&gt;

Stockholm has the largest community and boasts a primary school, a kindergarten, a library, a bi-monthly publication (''[[Judisk Krönika]]'') and a weekly Jewish radio program. Other cities like [[Malmö]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Borås]], [[Helsingborg]], [[Lund]], and [[Uppsala]] have Jewish communities as well. [[Synagogues]] can be found in Stockholm (which has two [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and one [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] synagogue), Göteborg (one Orthodox and one Conservative synagogue), Malmö (one Orthodox synagogue), and in [[Norrköping]] (although the Norrköping community is too small to perform regular services).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37833">'''Religious discrimination in Pakistan''' is a serious issue in modern day [[Pakistan]]. Christians, Hindus, Atheists and [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi Muslims]] among other religious groups in Pakistan are routinely discriminated against. They are at times refused jobs, loans, housing and other similar things simply because of their choice of religious faith. Christian churches and Ahmadi worship places and their worshippers are often attacked.&lt;ref name=Bales&gt;{{cite book|last=Bales|first=Kevin|title=Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy, Updated With a New Preface|year=2012|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520272910|edition=3rd Revised|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Pakistan's creation the 'hostage theory' had been espoused.

According to Farahnaz Ispahani, media advisor to the president of Pakistan from 2008 to 2012, the population of Pakistan's religious minorities has declined from 23% in 1947 to around 3-4% of the population today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livemint.com/Politics/F4r3Tmf51k8Sm6DGjPRaEN/Slow-genocide-of-minorities-in-Pakistan-Farahnaz-Ispahani.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1951 census, [[West Pakistan]] had 1.6% Hindu population, while [[East Pakistan]] (modern [[Bangladesh]]) had 22.05%. By 1997, the percentage of Hindus remained stable at 1.6% in Pakistan, while it dropped to 10.2% in Bangladesh.

In 1999 the United Nations [[Human Rights Council]] approved the first resolution against defamation of religions.

==Education system==

*Public school textbooks used by all children often had a strong Islamic orientation, 
*Public school and madrassa teachers had limited awareness or understanding of religious minorities and their beliefs, and were divided on whether religious minorities were citizens;
*Teachers often expressed very negative views about Ahmadis, Christians, and Jews, and successfully transmitted these biases to their students;
*Interviewees' expressions of tolerance often were intermixed with neutral and intolerant comments, leaving some room for improvement.&lt;ref name=USCIRF&gt;{{cite web|last=Leo|first=Leonard|title=Pakistan's Educational System Fuels Religious Discrimination|url=https://www.uscirf.gov/news-room/press-releases/pakistans-educational-system-fuels-religious-discrimination|publisher=USCIRF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{The Beatles history|above=[[File:The Fabs.JPG|250px]]}}

The religious views of the English rock band [[the Beatles]] evolved over time and differed between members [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]].

Although all four Beatles were associated with either [[Protestantism]] or [[Roman Catholicism]] in their childhood, they had all abandoned their religious upbringings by 1964. In 1965, while filming for ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' in [[the Bahamas]], a [[Hindu]] gave each of them a copy of a book on [[reincarnation]]. This encounter is widely regarded as having sparked the band's interest in Indian culture.

In March 1966, Lennon remarked to a journalist from the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'' that the Beatles had become "[[more popular than Jesus]]". The comment went unnoticed until in August the same year, the American magazine ''[[Datebook]]'' published it, inciting protests against the Beatles. The band were threatened, their records were publicly burned, and radio stations refused to play their songs.

After the Beatles' [[The Beatles' 1966 US tour|1966 US tour]], Harrison broadened his interest of Indian culture to [[Hinduism]]. He and his wife [[Pattie Boyd]] went on a pilgrimage to [[Mumbai]] to meet [[gurus]]. In 1968, all four Beatles went to [[Rishikesh]] in northern India to study meditation with the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]. Although the Beatles did not continue their relationship with the Maharishi, Harrison became involved in the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] tradition until his death in 2001.

After the [[break-up of the Beatles]] in 1970, Lennon continued to reject religion. His 1971 single "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]" is regarded as an "atheist anthem". In 2010, Starr said he had recently returned to [[monotheism]], while McCartney, in 2012, said he has a "personal faith in something good, but it doesn't really go much further than that".

==Background==
McCartney and Harrison were both baptised as [[Roman Catholics]] during childhood, although McCartney was raised [[non-denominational]]ly; his mother was Roman Catholic and his father was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] turned [[agnostic]].&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Barry (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=kkXNECitum0C&amp;dq=Many+Years+From+Now&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q Many Years From Now] (1 edition, page 4). Henry Holt &amp; Company. {{ISBN|978-0-8050-5248-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison was raised [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name="harryp492"&gt;Harry, ''The Beatles' Encyclopedia'', p. 492.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon attended [[St Peter's Church, Woolton, Liverpool|St Peter's]] [[Anglican]] church in [[Woolton]], South Liverpool, where he was a member of the youth group and sang occasionally in the choir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stpeters-woolton.org.uk/the-beatles-connection |title=St Peter's Church website, the Beatles connection|publisher=stpeters-woolton.org.uk |accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starr attended an [[evangelical Anglican]] church during his childhood.&lt;ref name=telegfeb&gt;{{cite news|title=Ringo Starr attended an Evangelical church in Liverpool|work=Christian Telegraph|date=9 February 2010|url=http://www.christiantelegraph.com/issue8593.html|accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Beatles years==
According to the band's press officer, [[Derek Taylor]], all four Beatles had abandoned their religious upbringings by 1964. In an interview for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', in August of that year, he stated that the Beatles were "completely anti-Christ. I mean, I am anti-Christ as well, but they're so anti-Christ they shock me which isn't an easy thing."&lt;ref&gt;''Saturday Evening Post'', 8–15 August 1964, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPA_iRdmJa0C&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=%22they're+so+anti-Christ+they+shock+me%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wOOg8KMezu&amp;sig=dlrO9JRrr5jlvnSDkhKMnVh9RJ0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DkGXTt16jcWzBq_O1d8D&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22they're%20so%20anti-Christ%20they%20shock%20me%22&amp;f=false |title=Phoenix Rising: The Rise and Fall of the American Republic |author=Donald G. Lett, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1965, the band gave an interview to ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, in which they defended themselves against claims that they were anti-religious, while at the same time emphatically declaring themselves to be agnostic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/dbbtspb.int2.html |title=Beatles Interview: Playboy, February 1965 (Page 2) - Beatles Interviews Database |publisher=Beatlesinterviews.org |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|1=&lt;poem&gt;
'''McCartney''': "We probably seem antireligious because of the fact that none of us believe in God."
'''Lennon''': "If you say you don't believe in God, everybody assumes you're antireligious, and you probably think that's what we mean by that. We're not quite sure 'what' we are, but I know that we're more agnostic than atheistic."
'''Playboy''': "Are you speaking for the group, or just for yourself?"
'''Lennon''': "For the group."
'''Harrison''': "John's our official religious spokesman."
'''McCartney''': "We all feel roughly the same. We're all agnostics."
'''Lennon''': "Most people are, anyway."
'''McCartney''': "In America, they're fanatical about God. I know somebody over there who said he was an atheist. The papers nearly refused to print it because it was such shocking news that somebody could actually be an atheist&amp;nbsp;... yeah&amp;nbsp;... and admit it."
'''Starr''': "He speaks for all of us."&lt;/poem&gt;
}}
It was also in February 1965 that filming for ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' began, on location in [[the Bahamas]]. During filming, a [[Hindu]] devotee presented each Beatle with a book about [[reincarnation]]. The incident is widely regarded as having instigated the band's interest in Indian culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/people/george-harrison/ |title=George Harrison biography |publisher=The Beatles Bible |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1966, on the eve of [[The Beatles' 1966 US tour]], American teen magazine ''[[Datebook]]'' published Lennon's remark that the Beatles had become "[[more popular than Jesus]]". Lennon had, in fact, originally made the remark to the British newspaper ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' and when it was first published in the United Kingdom, in March 1966, his words had provoked no public reaction. After ''Datebook'' quoted his comments five months later, however, vociferous protests broke out in the United States. The Beatles' records were publicly burned, threats were made and some radio stations refused to play their music. The protest also spread to other countries including Mexico, South Africa and Spain.&lt;ref name="DatebookLennonJesus"&gt;{{cite book |first=Terry |last=Rawlings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iDE0dH6ZLwUC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=datebook+lennon&amp;source=web&amp;ots=VS70r-jL0Z&amp;sig=waVkD8mCIwvsGe02sMf-1gnMEZI&amp;hl=en |title=Then, Now and Rare British Beat 1960–1969 |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |date=3 October 2002 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheBeatlesAreBigger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irememberjfk.com/mt/2008/10/the_beatles_are_bigger_than_wh.php |title=The Beatles Are Bigger than WHO? |publisher=I Remember JFK |accessdate=2 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713055734/http://www.irememberjfk.com/mt/2008/10/the_beatles_are_bigger_than_wh.php|archivedate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnLennonforgiven"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article5213614.ece |title=John Lennon forgiven for Jesus claim |first=Maurice |last=Chittenden |work=The Times |accessdate=2 June 2011 |location=London |date=23 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two press conferences were held in the US, where both [[Brian Epstein]] and Lennon expressed their regret that Lennon's words had been taken out of context and offence taken. At one of the conferences, Lennon described his own belief in God by quoting the Bishop of Woolwich, saying, "...&amp;nbsp;not as an old man in the sky. I believe that what people call God is something in all of us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gould |first=Jonathan |year=2008 |title=Can't Buy Me Love: The Beatles, Britain and America |publisher=[[Hachette (publisher)|Piatkus]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-7499-2988-6 |pages=346–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US tour went ahead as planned, although there was some disruption and picketing of their concerts.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Harrison's interest in Indian culture expanded to [[Hinduism]] and after the 1966 American tour, until the commencement of the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' album, he and his first wife [[Pattie Boyd]] went on a pilgrimage to [[Mumbai]] where Harrison studied [[sitar]], visited various holy places and met several [[gurus]], including [[Maharishi]]. Two years later, in 1968 all four Beatles travelled to [[Rishikesh]] in northern India to study meditation with the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]. Although the band later fell out with the Maharishi, Harrison continued his interest in Eastern philosophy. He embraced the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] tradition and, in the summer of 1969, produced the single "[[Hare Krishna Mantra (song)|Hare Krishna Mantra]]", performed by the devotees of the London [[Radha Krishna Temple]].&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Meditation on the man who saved The Beatles |first=Allan |last=Kozinn |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=7 February 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/07/arts/07iht-07yogi.9826732.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[break-up of the Beatles]], Lennon continued to reject religious teaching and organised religions. His 1971 single "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]" has been described as an "atheist anthem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/hermione-eyre-atheists-should-be-louder-and-prouder-422404.html |title=Atheists should be louder and prouder |first=Hermione |last=Eyre |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sings about his beliefs in the song "[[God (John Lennon song)|God]]", in which he states, "I don't believe in" magic, ''[[I Ching]]'', the [[Bible]], [[tarot]], [[Jesus]], [[Buddha]], [[mantra]], [[Gita]] and [[yoga]].  Although he commonly rejected the notion of religion, he did claim to have a spiritual side. In an interview conducted in September 1980, three months before his death, Lennon told ''Playboy'' journalist [[David Sheff]]: "People always got the image I was an anti-Christ or antireligion. I'm not. I'm a most religious fellow."&lt;ref name=johnconversion /&gt; When talking about [[Bob Dylan]]'s new-found Christianity, Lennon said, "But the whole religion business suffers from the 'Onward, Christian Soldiers' bit. There's too much talk about soldiers and marching and converting. I'm not pushing Buddhism, because I'm no more a Buddhist than I am a Christian, but there's one thing I admire about the religion [Buddhism]: There's no proselytizing."&lt;ref name=johnconversion&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.john-lennon.com/playboyinterviewwithjohnlennonandyokoono.htm |title=1980 Playboy Interview With John Lennon And Yoko Ono |publisher=John-Lennon.com |accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison continued to embrace the Hare Krishna tradition (particularly [[Japa|''japa-yoga'']] chanting with beads) and became a lifelong devotee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Partridge|first=Christopher|year=2005|title=The Re-enchantment of the West: Alternative Spiritualities, Sacralisation, Popular Culture, and Occulture, Vol. 1|edition=illustrated|publisher=Continuum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g05THJPH5xUC&amp;pg=PA153|isbn=978-0-567-08408-8|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a [[vegetarian]], on religious grounds, from 1968 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivu.org/people/music/harrison.html |publisher=International Vegetarian Union |title=George Harrison |accessdate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his wife [[Olivia Harrison|Olivia]], son [[Dhani Harrison|Dhani]] and close friends, members of the Radha Krishna Temple were at his bedside when Harrison died in Los Angeles on 29 November 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tillery|first=Gary|authorlink=Gary Tillery|title=Working Class Mystic: A Spiritual Biography of George Harrison|publisher=Quest Books|location=Wheaton, IL|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8356-0900-5|ref=harv|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her press statement, Olivia referred to the Hindu aspiration of breaking the [[Reincarnation|cycle of rebirth]] (and so achieving ''[[moksha]]''), saying: "The profound beauty of the moment of George's passing – of his awakening from this dream – was no surprise to those of us who knew how he longed to be with God. In that pursuit, he was relentless."&lt;ref name="Doggett p 332"&gt;{{cite book|last=Doggett|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Doggett|title=You Never Give Me Your Money: The Beatles After the Breakup|publisher=It Books|location=New York, NY|year=2011|isbn=978-0-06-177418-8|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with his wishes, Harrison's ashes were scattered at [[Varanasi]] in India, at the confluence of the [[Ganges]], [[Yamuna]] and [[Sarasvati River|Saraswati]] rivers.&lt;ref name="Doggett p 332" /&gt;

Speaking at the [[Grammy Museum at L.A. Live|Grammy Museum]], Los Angeles, in February 2010, Starr stated that he had recently returned to [[monotheism]], saying "I stepped off the path there for many years and found my way [back] onto it, thank God." He was also reported as saying "For me, God is in my life. I don't hide from that ... I think the search has been on since the '60s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hough|first=Andrew |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/the-beatles/7142630/The-Beatles-drummer-Ringo-Starr-admits-I-have-found-God.html |title=The Beatles' drummer Ringo Starr admits: 'I have found God' |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= 3 February 2010|accessdate=30 October 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Olivia Harrison's 2011 book ''George Harrison: Living in the Material World'', Starr describes himself as "a Christian Hindu with Buddhist tendencies".

In a 2012 interview for ''[[The Independent]]'', McCartney said, "I have a kind of personal faith in something good, but it doesn't really go much further than that." He also went on to say, "Jesus I could see, that's a historical character."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/paul-mccartney-talks-jimmy-savile-and-unusually-for-him-the-real-john-lennon-8344233.html Paul McCartney talks Jimmy Savile and (unusually for him) the real John Lennon,]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13651">'''Rigpa''' is the name of an international [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] organization founded by [[Sogyal Rinpoche]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=About_Rigpa About Rigpa] at Rigpawiki&lt;/ref&gt; It has centers and groups in 41 countries around the world. Following allegations of sexual and physical abuse in a letter by former students in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/sexual-assaults-violent-rages-inside-dark-world-buddhist-teacher/|title=Sexual assaults and violent rages...

==History==
After five years teaching in the West, Sogyal Rinpoche gave the name 'Rigpa' to his work.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Rigpa, The Rigpa Journal, volume 2&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Rigpa had just one centre, in north-west London and was known as Dzogchen Orgyen Chö Ling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Dzogchen_Orgyen_Ch%C3%B6_Ling Dzogchen Orgyen Chö Ling]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980, Sogyal Rinpoche was teaching in the UK, France, the United States, Ireland and Holland. Rigpa centres opened in a number of major cities, and in each country Rigpa was established as a non-profit organization. A programme of Easter and summer retreats began, and Rigpa’s first retreat centre, [[Dzogchen Beara]], was set up on the west coast of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzogchenbeara.org/index.php?pid=2 DzogchenBeara.org: About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major events===
Rigpa invited the [[Dalai Lama]], or sponsored his teachings or empowerments, on a number of occasions; in Paris in 1982, London in 1984 and San Jose in 1989. Five and a half thousand people attended the teachings in San Jose, in what at the time was the largest gathering of practitioners and masters of [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Buddhadharma]] in America, and possibly in the West.

In 1990, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche taught and gave empowerments to 1,500 people at Rigpa’s summer retreat near Grenoble in the French Alps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Prapoutel_1990 Rigpa Wiki: Prapoutel 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the [[Dzogchen Monastery]] in [[Kollegal]] in India, sponsored by Rigpa, was officially inaugurated when [[Dzogchen Rinpoche]] invited the Dalai Lama to give empowerments. In the same year, Rigpa opened its main retreat centre, Lerab Ling near Montpellier in the south of France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lerabling.org/index.php?pid=2 LerabLing.org: About Lerab Ling]&lt;/ref&gt; Thich [[Nhat Hanh]], Khenpo [[Jigme Phuntsok]] and [[Penor Rinpoche]] were among the masters who taught there in the years that followed.

In 1999, [[Trulshik Rinpoche]] founded the basis for a monastic community within Rigpa by ordaining the first nuns.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} In 2000 the Dalai Lama visited Lerab Ling, and gave five days of teachings entitled ''The Path to Enlightenment'', attended by more than 10,000 students of Tibetan Buddhism from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Lerab_Gar_2000 Rigpa Wiki:Lerab Gar 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; The teachings given by the Dalai Lama have been published in a book entitled ''Mind in Comfort and Ease: The Vision of Enlightenment in the Great Perfection''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wisdompubs.org/Pages/display.lasso?-KeyValue=32980&amp;-Token.Action=&amp;image=1 Wisdom Publications: Mind in Comfort and Ease]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lerab Ling was officially recognized as a ‘religious congregation’ in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lerabling.org/index.php/lang-en/lerab-ling-mainmenu-50/monastic-community About Lerab Ling] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630025737/http://www.lerabling.org/index.php/lang-en/lerab-ling-mainmenu-50/monastic-community |date=June 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a traditional three-storey temple at Lerab Ling was completed, including a seven-metre high statue of [[Buddha Shakyamuni]]. Rigpa's first three-year retreat began, with over 300 people remaining in closed retreat at Lerab Ling from 2006–2009, and since 2006, over 3,000 students have followed a 'home retreat' programme in their own countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhalasun.com/news/?p=8001 Groundbreaking three-year retreat draws to a close]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, work began on Rigpa's Spiritual Care Centre at Dzogchen Beara.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritualcare.ie/index.php?pid=162 The Spiritual Care Centre at Dzogchen Beara, Who are we?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying''===
In 1993, Sogyal Rinpoche published ''[[The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Sogyal Rinpoche, ''[[The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying]]'', {{ISBN|0-06-250834-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; the success of which led to a great expansion in the work of Rigpa. A Spiritual Care Education and Training Programme was set up,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpa.org/Spiritual_care.html Rigpa.org:Spiritual Care] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312041818/http://www.rigpa.org/Spiritual_care.html |date=2009-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1996 Rigpa presented a conference on care for the dying, near Munich, which had a considerable influence on the emerging hospice movement in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpa.org/en/about-rigpa/history-of-rigpa/year-by-year-in-detail/1992-1996.html History of Rigpa: 1992-1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suspension of membership from UBF ===
Following the testimonies from current and ex-Rigpa students, of physical, sexual and financial abuse by Sogyal Rinpoche, the Union Bouddhiste De France suspended the membership of Rigpa Lérab Ling and Rigpa France on August 3rd, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bouddhisme-france.org/espace-presse/article/communique-suite-au-scandale-lie-a-sogyal-rinpoche.html|title=Communiqué suite au scandale lié à Sogyal Rinpoché - L'UBF : Fédération des Associations Bouddhistes de France|last=grafactory.net|first=Yves Tannier -|website=www.bouddhisme-france.org|language=fr|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Independent investigation from Lewis Silkin ===
In July 2017 a number of allegations of misconduct were brought against Rigpa's founder, Sogyal Rinpoche. One of the actions undertaken by Rigpa was to commission an independent investigation into the allegations to enable witnesses to come forward, and "be listened to in an open, impartial and sensitive way". 

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20181001010418/https://static1.squarespace.com/static/580dbe87e6f2e16700cb79fe/t/5b8f7c1e1ae6cfb38491e668/1536130081917/Lewis+Silkin+report.pdf report by Karen Baxter] of UK law firm [[Lewis Silkin LLP|Lewis Silkin]] confirmed that, on the balance of probabilities:

* some students of Sogyal Lakar (who were part of the ‘inner circle’) have been subjected to serious physical, sexual and emotional abuse by him; and

* there were senior individuals within Rigpa who were aware of at least some of these issues and failed to address them, leaving others at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928082832/https://www.rigpa.org/independent-investigation-report|title=Independent Investigation Report|last=|first=|date=|website=Rigpa|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her findings [http://www.lewissilkin.com/People/Karen-Baxter Karen Baxter] described one of the senior managers interviewed for the report as being “guarded, hostile and inconsistent”. Another senior member of the management team was described by the lawyer as involved in “a pro-active cover-up”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/09/tibetan-buddhism-facing-abuse-scandal/|title=Why Tibetan Buddhism is facing up to its own abuse scandal|last=Shute|first=Joe|date=2018-09-09|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK Charities Commission has made it very clear in recent years that they will expect organisations with safeguarding problems to launch an investigation, co-operate with the authorities and put right what they can before they are allowed to move on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hudgellsolicitors.co.uk/news/abuse/rigpa-investigation-highlights-the-risk-of-unchallenged-ongoing-abuse-within-religious-groups/|title=Rigpa investigation highlights the risk of unchallenged, ongoing abuse within religious groups {{!}} Hudgell Solicitors™‎|date=2018-09-20|work=Hudgell Solicitors™‎|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rigpa has acknowledged the gravity of the independent report, but has not yet accepted the findings of the investigation, nor committed to implementing its recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rigpa.org/press/|title=Press|website=Rigpa|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study and practice==
Rigpa has developed a graduated "study and practice" program that is delivered internationally and which can take several years to complete. It begins with foundation-level courses introducing basic [[meditation]] practice, using ''[[samatha]]'' methods such as resting the mind on an object (such as the breath or a picture of [[Padmasambhava]]) and [[mantra]] recitation. Then the [[Mahayana]] teachings are presented, together with the ''[[tonglen]]'' practice of giving and receiving. Next, students are taught [[ngöndro|Vajrayana preliminaries]], including "Taking Refuge" and ''[[bodhicitta]]'' (mind of awakening).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpaonlinecourses.org/en/meditation-and-other-courses.html Meditation &amp; other courses]&lt;/ref&gt; Older students are taught ''[[sadhana]]'' practices focusing on the ''[[Terma (religion)|terma]]'' revelations of Sogyal Rinpoche's predecessor, [[Tertön Sogyal]], as well as the practice of [[Dzogchen]] meditation.

Rigpa also has a program, Rigpé Yeshé, to help members who are parents and wish to educate their children as Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rigpeyeshe.rigpa.org/en/about-rigpe-yeshe.html About Rigpé Yeshé]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rigpa Shedra===
The Rigpa Shedra, or study college, was established in 2001 in Lerab Ling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Rigpa_Shedra Rigpa Shedra] at Rigpawiki&lt;/ref&gt; It offers courses based on traditional Buddhist texts taught by lamas such as [[Dzogchen Rinpoche]], [[Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche]], [[Ringu Tulku]] and [[Khenpo Pema Sherab]]. A longer, more intensive version known as Rigpa Shedra East, which is based in Pharping near Kathmandu and is under the guidance of [[Khenpo Namdrol]], began in 2006. This eastern shedra runs for four months a year and the full curriculum takes nine years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rigpa Shedra|url=http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Rigpa_Shedra|work=Rigpa Wiki|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachers==
Over the years many senior teachers from the Tibetan tradition have taught in Rigpa centres, including the Dalai Lama, [[Sakya Trizin]], [[Dilgo Khyentse]] Rinpoche, [[Dudjom Rinpoche]], [[Kalu Rinpoche]], [[Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche]] and [[Trulshik Rinpoche]]. More recently, regular teachers at Rigpa centres around the world have included many from the younger generation of lamas, such as [[Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche]], [[Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche]], [[Tsoknyi Rinpoche]], [[Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche]] and [[Khandro Rinpoche]]. A number of teachers from other traditions have also been invited, including [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], who taught in Lerab Ling in 1993, and [[Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero]], who taught in Rigpa London in 1983. Senior students of Sogyal Rinpoche have taught courses on meditation and Buddhism since the early days of Rigpa. Such student teachers include [[Patrick Gaffney (Buddhist)|Patrick Gaffney]], who edited the ''Tibetan Book of Living and Dying'', Ian Maxwell,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Ian_Maxwell Ian Maxwell] at Rigpawiki&lt;/ref&gt; Maureen Cooper, [[Christine Longaker]] and Andrew Warr.

==Publications and translation==
Rigpa is well known in the Tibetan Buddhist community for its Tibetan calendar, which was first published in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Rigpa_Tibetan_Calendar Rigpa Tibetan Calendar] at Rigpawiki&lt;/ref&gt; Other publications include ''View: The Rigpa Journal'' which began in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viewmagazine.org/about-us.html View: About us]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Rigpa's translation group published their translation of a book on [[lojong]], ''To Dispel the Misery of the World'', by the [[Sakya]] master Ga Rabjampa, with a foreword by Sogyal Rinpoche's former tutor, Khenpo Appey Rinpoche.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisdompubs.org/pages/display.lasso?-KeyValue=33154&amp;-Token.Action=&amp;image=1 To Dispel the Misery of the World]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SilverWashingCup.jpg|thumb|right|A silver washing cup used for ''netilat yadayim'']]
[[File:NatlaCup.jpg|thumb|right| A two-handled Natla (נַטְלָה) cup photographed in a [[Jerusalem]] public lavatory.]]

In '''Judaism''', '''ritual washing''', or ablution, takes two main forms. A '''''tevilah''''' (טְבִילָה) is a full body immersion in a [[mikveh]], and a '''''netilat yadayim''''' which is the washing of the hands with a cup (see [[Handwashing in Judaism]]).

References to ritual washing are found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and are elaborated in the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]]. They have been codified in various codes of Jewish law and tradition, such as [[Maimonides]]' ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (12th century) and [[Joseph Karo]]'s ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' (16th century.) These customs are most commonly observed within [[Orthodox Judaism]]. In [[Conservative Judaism]], the practices are normative with certain leniencies and exceptions. Ritual washing is not generally performed in [[Reform Judaism]].

== Hebrew Bible ==
The Hebrew Scriptures include various regulations about bathing:
:And whoever he that hath issue (a ''[[zav]]'', ejaculant with an unusual discharge) touches without having rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.({{bibleverse||Leviticus|15:11|}})
A subsequent seven clean days are then required, culminating in a ritual and temple offering before the ''zav'' is clean of his malady:
:Now in case the one having a running discharge would become clean from his running discharge, he must then count for himself seven days for his purification, and he must wash his garments and bathe his flesh in running water; and he must be clean. And on the eighth day he should take for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and he must come to the entrance of the tent of meeting and give them to the priest.({{bibleverse||Leviticus|15:13-14|}})

And also references to hand-washing:
:I will wash my hands in innocence; so will I compass Thine altar, O LORD ({{bibleverse||Psalms|26:6|}})

== Late Second Temple period ==
[[Philo of Alexandria]] refers to ritual washing in the context of the Temple and Leviticus, but also speaks of spiritual "washing."&lt;ref&gt;Jutta Leonhardt ''Jewish worship in Philo of Alexandria'' Page 270 - 2001 3 Ritual washing Washing is used for ritual purification in the context of the Temple worship. In Som. I 81 Philo quotes Lev 22 6 f, which states that no one is permitted to eat from holy things "unless the body is washed with water" ..."&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Qumran]] basins which served as baths have been identified, and among the Dead Sea scrolls texts on maintaining ritual purity reflect the requirements of Leviticus.&lt;ref&gt;The Qumran community - Page 92 Michael Anthony Knibb - 1987 -"10-13, and among the many cisterns at Qumran two basins have been identif1ed which served as baths and were perhaps used for ... Unclean, unclean shall he be as long as he rejects the precepts of God: the language is drawn from Lev."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rabbinical Judaism ==
[[File:MayimAchronimSet.jpg|thumb|right|A Silver Mayim Acharonim Set]]
Both traditional religious and secular scholars agree that ritual washing in Judaism was derived by the Rabbis of the Talmud from a more extensive set of ritual washing and purity practices in use in the days of the Temple in Jerusalem, based on various verses in the Hebrew Scriptures and received traditions. There is disagreement, however, about the origins and meanings of these practices. This article first describes these practices as they exist in contemporary traditional Judaism, then discusses various alternative perspectives on their nature, origins, and meaning.

Traditional Judaism requires certain types of ritual washing. Some of these types do not require a special ritual body of water (and can be done with tap water):

#''[[Handwashing in Judaism|Netilat yadayim]]'' ("Raising [after ritually washing] the hands"), also known as ''Mayim Rishonim'', which is done with a blessing, prior to eating any [[bread]] with a meal
##''Mayim acharonim'' ("After-waters") a law or custom of ritually washing one's fingers after a meal, to protect oneself from touching the eyes with hazardous residue.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'', ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 181&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Netilat Yadayim Shacharit'' ("Raising [after ritually washing] the hands of the morning"), when getting up in the morning&lt;ref name="cite encyclopedia"/&gt; after a full night's sleep, or even after a lengthy nap, by pouring a large cup of water over one's hands, alternating three times.
#''Netilat yadayim'' (without a blessing) to remove ''tuma'' ("impurity") after:
##Touching objects{{ambiguous|reason=All tamei objects? Only some tamei objects? See talk.|date=August 2013}} that convey ''[[tumah]]'' such as:
###A part of the body customarily covered&lt;ref name="cite encyclopedia"/&gt; (private parts, back, arm pits, etc.)
###Inside of nose or ear
###The scalp (but not if one just touched the hair)
###Leather shoes
###A ritually unclean {{citation needed span|[[animal]]|note=see talk|date=August 2013}} or [[insect]]
##Cutting one's hair or nails
##Taking off one's shoes&lt;ref name="cite encyclopedia"/&gt;
##Visiting a [[cemetery]]&lt;ref name="cite encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2011|title=Cleanliness|last=|first=|encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion|editor-last=Berlin|editor-first=Adele|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKAaJXvUaUoC&amp;pg=PA174|quote=The Shulkhan Arukh (Orach Chayim 4:18, 158-165) lists occasions when hands should be washed; upon arising each morning, after urination and defecation, after taking off one's shoes, or touching any part of the body customarily covered, after visiting a cemetery, after undressing, before and after meals, after marital relations, and after coming into contact with lice.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
##[[Sexual intercourse]].&lt;ref name="cite encyclopedia"/&gt; Some communities observe a requirement for washing one's body (which may be done with tap water) after the above or after otherwise experiencing a seminal emission since these activities make the man ''baal keri'' (one who is impure due to ejaculation.)
#After visiting the bathroom,&lt;ref name="cite encyclopedia"/&gt; the ritual washing of one's hands as a symbol of both bodily cleanliness and of removing human impurity – see ''Netilat yadayim'' above.
#To remove ''tumat met'' ("impurity from death") after participating in a funeral procession or coming within four cubits of a corpse
#During a [[Passover Seder]], ''netilat yadayim''&lt;ref&gt;''Shulkhan Arukh'', ''Orach Chayim'' 473:6&lt;/ref&gt; is performed without any blessing being recited, before the eating of a vegetable, called ''[[karpas]]'', prior to the main meal.
#Every [[Kohen]] present has his hands ritually washed in [[synagogue]] by the [[Levite|Levi'im]] (Levites) before uttering the [[Priestly Blessing]] in front of the congregation.
#Some have the custom of washing their hands prior to scribal work

Other occasions require full immersion in a special body of water, such as a [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]], stream, or mikveh:

# By a married Jewish woman after her ''[[niddah]]'' period concludes following [[menstruation]] or other uterine bleeding and she wishes to resume conjugal relations with her husband. This requires special preparation.
# The day before ("eve of") [[Yom Kippur]] and other Festivals
# By some Orthodox Jews on Friday afternoons (in preparation for Shabbat)
# When converting to Judaism.
# ''Taharah'', ("Purification"), the ritual washing and cleansing, and immersion in a mikveh according to some customs, of a Jew's body prior to burial.

===Temple Mount ===
Prior to ascending the [[Temple Mount]] by those Orthodox authorities who permit ascending the Temple mount (and also by the [[Masorti Judaism|Masorti]] movement in Israel). For this purpose an ordinary mikveh is not sufficient—it requires a pool of "living water," i.e. a spring, river, or a pool attached to one of these.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===According to Conservative Judaism===
Some rabbis within [[Conservative Judaism]] advise non-married women who choose to engage in sexual activity to also observe ''niddah'' and immersion in a ''mikveh.

=== Washing the hands ===&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Handwashing in Judaism]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;
{{Main|Handwashing in Judaism}}

==== General basis in Jewish law ====

The [[Talmud]] used the requirement of washing the hands in [[Leviticus]] 15:11 as a hint for general hand washing law, using ''[[Asmachta (Talmudical hermeneutics)|asmachta]]'' - a [[talmudical hermeneutics]] form in which the verse used as a hint rather than an [[exegesis]].

The general Hebrew term for ritual hand washing is ''netilat yadayim'', meaning ''lifting up of the hands''. The term "the washing of hands" after excretion is sometimes referred to as "to wash ''asher yatzar''" referring to the [[berakhah]] (blessing) said which starts with these words.

[[Halakha]] (Jewish law) requires that the water used for ritual washing be naturally pure, unused, not contain other substances, and not be discoloured. The water also must be poured from a vessel as a human act, on the basis of references in the Bible to this practice, e.g. [[Elisha]] pouring water upon the hands of [[Elijah]]. Water should be poured on each hand at least twice. A clean dry substance should be used instead if water is unavailable.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==== How performed ====
Contemporary practice is to pour water on each hand three times for most purposes using a cup, and alternating the hands between each occurrence; this ritual is now known by the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] term ''negel vasser'', meaning ''nail water''. This Yiddish term is also used for a special cup used for such washing.

==== The blessing ====

בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה 
ה׳ אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם 
אֲשֶׁר קִדְּשָׁנוּ בְּמִצְוֹתָיו

עַל 
נְטִילַת 
יָדָיִם
Blessed are you, HaShem our God
King of the universe
Who has sanctified us with His commandments,
and has commanded us concerning the elevation of hands.

====At meals====
{{See also|Handwashing in Judaism}}
The [[Babylonian Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berachot]]'' 53b&lt;/ref&gt; discusses two types of washing at meals: washing before a meal is described as ''first waters'' (the Hebrew term is ''mayim rishonim''), and after a meal is known as ''last waters'' (the Hebrew term is ''mayim aharonim''). The first term has generally fallen from contemporary usage; the second term has stuck. The modern term for the former is ''[[Handwashing in Judaism|Netilat yadayim]]'', washing of hands. Washing before meals is normative in [[Orthodox Judaism]].

The [[Gemarah]] of the Babylonian Talmud contains homiletic descriptions of the importance of the practice, including an argument that washing before meals is so important that neglecting it is tantamount to un[[chastity]], and risks divine punishment in the form of sudden destruction or poverty.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]]'' 62b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sotah (Talmud)|Sotah]]'' 4b&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion of ''mayim acharonim'', washing after meals, contains a suggestion that washing after meals, as a health measure, is the more important of the two washings, on grounds that the salt used as a preservative in food could cause blindness if the eyes were rubbed without washing.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yoma]]'' 83b&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] explained that our involvement in the physical act of eating has the potential to diminish our sense of holiness. To counteract this influence, we wash our hands after the meal. The Talmudic Sages spoke of washing away the "salt of Sodom" – a place whose very name is a symbol of selfishness and indifference to others. "This dangerous salt, which can blind our eyes to the needs of others, is rendered harmless through the purifying ritual of ''mayim acharonim''."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morrison |first1=Chanan |last2=Kook |first2=Abraham Isaac Kook|title=Gold from the Land of Israel: A New Light on the Weekly Torah Portion - From the Writings of Rabbi Abraham Isaac HaKohen Kook' |date=2006 |publisher=Urim Publications |isbn=965-7108-92-6 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''mayim acharonim'' was once not widely practiced (for example, until recently it did not appear in many Orthodox Passover [[Haggadah]]s) it has undergone something of a revival and has become more widely observed in recent years, particularly for special meals such as the [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays]]. [[Conservative Judaism]] has supported discontinuing the practice of ''mayim acharonim'' on the grounds that the rabbis of the Talmud instituted it as a health measure, and since modern foods no longer contain preservatives so dangerous as to cause blindness upon contact with the eyes, washing the hands after meals is no longer required and can be discontinued by contemporary rabbinic decision.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Only the washing before the meal is generally done outside Orthodox Judaism.

====Before worship====
[[File:Ramban Synagogue IMG 0027.JPG|250px|right|thumb|A sink for ritual hand washing at the entrance to the [[Ramban Synagogue]].]]
According to the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'', a person should wash both hands before prayer, based on a tradition requiring ritual purification upon entering the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], in whose absence prayer, in [[Orthodox Judaism]], serves in its place.

====Before the Priestly Blessing ====

In [[Orthodox Judaism]] (and, in some cases, in [[Conservative Judaism]]), [[Kohanim]], members of the priestly class, offer the [[Priestly Blessing]] before the congregation on certain occasions. Before performing their offices, they are required to wash their hands. Judaism traditionally traces this requirement to the [[Torah]]:

:And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat; when they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to cause an offering made by fire to smoke unto the LORD.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|30:19|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is customary for [[Levites]] to pour the water over the hands of the Kohanim and to assist them in other ways. In many communities, washing the feet before the Priestly Blessing is not practiced in the absence of a [[Temple in Jerusalem]].

====After sleeping====

The [[Talmud]] states God commanded Jews ''to wash the hands'' and provides the text of the ''netilat yadaim'' blessing still in use.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]]'' 60b&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' a person who slept is required to wash upon arising,&lt;ref name="cite encyclopedia"/&gt; and says the ''natilat yadayim'' blessing.

=== Full-body immersion (Tvilah) ===
[[File:14440 The mikve in besalu.jpg|thumb|A medieval [[mikveh]] for the purpose of ritual immersion in [[Besalú]], Spain]]
There are several occasions on which [[biblical]] or rabbinical regulations require immersion of the whole body, referred to as '''tvilah'''. Depending on the circumstances, such ritual bathing might require immersion in "living water" - either by using a natural stream or by using a [[mikveh]] (a specially constructed ritual bath, connected directly to a natural source of water, such as a spring).

This article discusses the requirements of immersion in Rabbinic Judaism and its descendants. Some other branches of Judaism, such as [[Falasha]] Judaism, have substantially different practices including the requirement of an actual spring or stream.

====Conversion to Judaism ====
Judaism requires converts into Judaism to immerse themselves fully in water in a mikveh or body of "living water."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= |title=The Mikveh’s Significance in Traditional Conversion |publisher=My Jewish Learning |author=Rabbi Maurice Lamm |access-date=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bodily fluids and skin conditions ====

The [[Torah]] prescribes rituals addressing the skin condition known as ''[[tzaraath]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:8-9|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and unusual genital discharges in a man or women ([[Zav]]/[[Zavah]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|15:5-10|}}&lt;/ref&gt; which required special sacrifices and rituals in the days of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] including immersion in a mikveh. In addition, a period of ritual impurity follows a seminal discharge (''[[keri]]'') and a women's ''[[niddah]]'' period (menstruation), ending with ritual immersion.

The practice of checking for ''tzaraath'' fell out of use with the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and the end of sacrificial rites. However, each of the other requirements remains in effect to some extent in Orthodox Judaism and (to a lesser degree) in [[Conservative Judaism]].

==== Niddah ====
{{Main|Niddah}}

''[[Niddah]]'' remains fully observed in Orthodox Judaism and normative in Conservative Judaism. Women's ritual immersion prior to resuming sexual relations following their ''niddah'' period remains the principal use of contemporary mikvehs.

==== ''Zavah'' ====
{{Main|Zavah}}
A woman experiencing uterine blood not part of normal menstruation was classified as a ''zavah'' in the days of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and remained in a state of ritual impurity for 7 days prior to immersion. Today, the law of ''zavah'' remains in effect in Orthodox Judaism, in two respects. Due to extreme conditions in Roman Palestine in the time of the Amoraim, women's periods became irregular, and women became unable to determine whether or not their discharges were regular (''niddah'') or irregular (''zavah''). As a result, women adapted a stringency combining the ''niddah'' and ''zavah'' periods, refraining from intercourse and physical contact with their husbands for seven days of the ''zavah'' period following menstruation, for a total of approximately 12 days per month, which Orthodox women continue to observe today. The laws of ''zavah'' are also applied, as in Biblical times, to uterine blood discharges outside regular menstruation. Such circumstances are often interpreted leniently, however, and rabbinic stratagems have been devised to lessen their severity. Women experiencing irregularities (droplets) are sometimes advised to wear coloured underwear to mitigate the detectability of evidence of ''zavah'' status and hence a need to determine that a woman is a ''zavah''.

==== ''Keri'' ====
Men experiencing a seminal discharge, including through regular marital intercourse, were prohibited from entering the Temple in Jerusalem and required to immerse in a mikveh, remaining ritually impure until the evening. The [[Talmud]] ascribes to the [[Great Assembly]] of [[Ezra]] a Rabbinic decree imposing further restrictions on men ritually impure from a seminal discharge, including a prohibition on studying Torah and from participating in services.

[[Maimonides]] wrote a responsum lifting the decree of Ezra, based on an opinion in the Talmud stating that it had failed to be observed by a majority of the community and the Jewish people found themselves unable to sustain it. However, Maimonides continued to follow the ''Keri'' restrictions as a matter of personal observance. Since then, observance of the rules of ''Keri'' and hence regular mikveh use by men fell into disuse in many communities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} [[Hasidic Judaism]], however, revived the practice of regular mikveh use, advocating regular daily mikveh use as a way of achieving spiritual purity. The growth of Hasidic Judaism resulted in a revival of mikveh use by men. In addition, some [[Sephardic Judaism|Sephardic]] and [[Mizrahi Judaism|Mizrahi]] communities continued to observe the rules of ''keri'' throughout.

===Death===

====Contact with a carcass====

According to [[Leviticus]], anyone who comes into contact with or carries any creature that hadn't been deliberately killed by ''[[shechita]]'' was regarded by the biblical regulations as having made themselves unclean by doing so, and therefore was compelled to immerse their entire body.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|17:15|}}&lt;/ref&gt; This regulation is immediately preceded by the rule against eating anything still containing blood, and according to biblical scholars this is also the context of the regulation about not eating non-sacrifices - that the regulation only treats such consumption as unclean if there is a risk of blood still remaining within the carcass.&lt;ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible"/&gt; In the version of this regulation in [[Deuteronomy]], eating the bodies of such creatures isn't described as making an individual ritually impure, nor requires the eater to wash their body, but instead such consumption is expressly forbidden, although the creature is allowed to be passed on to a [[Nochri|stranger]], who is permitted to eat it.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:21|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contact with a corpse====

Anyone who came into contact with a human [[corpse]], or [[grave (burial)|grave]], was so ritually impure that they had to be sprinkled with the water produced from the [[red heifer]] ritual, in order to become ritually pure again;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|19:19|}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the person who carried out the red heifer ritual and who sprinkled the water, was to be treated as having become ritually impure by doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|19:7-8|}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to biblical scholars, this ritual derives from the same origin as the ritual described in [[Deuteronomy]] for a group of people to [[Atonement in Judaism|atone]] for murder by an unknown perpetrator,&lt;ref&gt;Cheyne and Black, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; according to which a heifer is killed at a stream, and hands are washed over it;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|16:26|}}&lt;/ref&gt; biblical scholars believe that these are both ultimately cases of [[sympathetic magic]],&lt;ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible"&gt;''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and similar rituals existed in Greek&lt;ref&gt;[[Sophocles]], ''Ajax'', 664&lt;/ref&gt; and Roman&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'', 2:217&lt;/ref&gt; mythology.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[masoretic text]] describes the water produced from the red heifer ritual as a [[sin offering]];&lt;ref&gt;masoretic text of Numbers 19:9&lt;/ref&gt; some English translations discount this detail, because it differs from other sin offerings by not being killed at the altar, although biblical scholars believe that this demonstrates a failure by these translations to understand the meaning of sin offerings.&lt;ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible"/&gt;

====Treatment of a corpse====
No explicit regulations are expressed in the bible concerning the treatment of a corpse itself, although historic rabbinical sources saw an implication that the dead should be thoroughly washed per [[Ecclesiastes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|5:15|}}&lt;/ref&gt; as children are washed when born;&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer Hasidim'' 560&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Eliezer ben Joel HaLevi]], a prominent ''[[Rishonim|rishon]]'', argued that the corpse should be cleansed carefully, including the ears and fingers, with nails pared and hair combed, so that the corpse could be laid to rest in the manner that the person had visited the [[synagogue]] during life.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; Washing of corpses was not observed among the Jews living in [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[Babylon]], for which they were criticised as dying ''in filth, without a candle and without a bath'';&lt;ref&gt;''[[Genesis Rabbah]]'' 38:5&lt;/ref&gt; at the time, the non-Jewish Persians were predominantly [[Zoroastrian]], and consequently believed that dead bodies were inherently ritually unclean, and should be exposed to the elements in a [[Tower of Silence]] to avoid defiling the earth with them.

In the early periods the body was washed in a standard mikveh,&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; and this is frequently the form of the ritual in the present day, but the traditional washing ceremony, known as ''tahara'', became quite detailed over time. A special building for the corpse-washing existed in the cemetery in 15th century [[Prague]],&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer haMaharil''&lt;/ref&gt; a practice which obtains in many Jewish communities today; a mikveh is provided at a number of ancient tombs. Female corpses are traditionally cleaned only by other females, and males only by other males.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

Between death and the traditional ceremony, the body is placed on the ground, and covered with a sheet, and at the start of the traditional ceremony, the body is lifted from the ground onto a special board or slab (a ''tahara board''), so that it lies facing the door, with a white sheet underneath.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; The clothes are then removed from the corpse (if they were not removed when the corpse was placed on the ground), and at this point {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|5:15|}} is recited by the enactors of the ritual, as it refers to the removal of filthy clothes.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; Following this, the body is thoroughly rubbed with [[:wikt:lukewarm|lukewarm]] water, with the mouth of the corpse covered so that water does not enter it;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; the next part of the ritual is the pouring of water over the head, while {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|36:25|}} is quoted, since it refers to the sprinkling of water to produce cleanness;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; and then each limb is washed downwards, while {{bibleverse||Canticles|5:11|}} and the following verses, which describe the beauty of elements of the body, are spoken.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; Finally, nine measures of cold water are poured over the body while it is upright, which is the core element of the ceremony, and it is then dried (according to some customs), and en[[shroud]]ed;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; in ancient times the hair and nails were also cut, but by the 19th century the hair was merely combed, and the nails were just cleansed with a special pin, unless their length is excessive.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; After the ceremony, the ''taharah board'' is washed and dried, but is kept facing the same way, as there is a [[superstition]] with the belief that turning it the other way will cause another person to die within 3 days.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; Many communities have replaced the pouring of nine measures by immersion in a specially constructed mikveh.

A more elaborate ceremony, known as the ''grand washing'' (''rehizah gedolah''), is available for the corpses of the more significant individuals; [[Hillel the Elder]] is traditionally credited with its invention. According to this latter form of ceremony, the water used for washing was perfumed by [[rose]], [[Myrtus|myrtle]], or [[aromatic spices]]; the use of spices was an ancient practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|16:14|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mishnah]] especially mentions the washing ceremonies using myrtle.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Beitzah]]'' 6a; ''Berachot'' 8:1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yom Kippur ==

The biblical regulations of [[Yom Kippur]] require the officiating [[Kohen Gadol|Jewish High Priest]] to bathe himself in water after sending off the [[scapegoat]] to [[Azazel]], and a similar requirement was imposed on the person who led the scapegoat away, and the person who burned the sacrifices during the rituals of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:24|}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|16:26|}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|16:28|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mishnah]] states that the High Priest had to immerse himself five times, and his hands and feet had to be washed ten times.&lt;ref&gt;''Yoma'' 3:3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ritual immersion by men ==

In modern Orthodox Judaism, there is a widespread [[minhag]] for the laity including men to immerse themselves on the day prior to [[Yom Kippur]] and often do so before the [[three pilgrimage festivals]], and before [[Rosh Hashanah]]; some [[Haredi Jews]] additionally immerse themselves at least before a [[Shabbat]], and some [[Hassidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]] do so daily before morning prayers.

== Reason for contemporary observance ==

Both Orthodox and Conservative Judaism currently have multiple views on the reason for contemporary observance of ritual washing and immersion obligation.

In Orthodox Judaism, opinion is generally split between a view that maintains that those Biblical rules related to [[Tumah|ritual purity]] that are possible to observe in the absence of a [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] and a [[Red heifer]] remain in force and Jews remain Biblically obligated to observe such of them as they can, and a view that Biblical ritual impurity requirements apply only in the presence of a [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and the current rules represent only [[Mitzvah#Rabbinic mitzvah|rabbinic ordinances]], practices decreed by the Rabbis in memory of the Temple.

In December 2006, Conservative Judaism's [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] issued three responsa on the subject of [[Niddah]]. All three ruled the traditional requirements of ritual washing remained in effect for Conservative Jews (with some leniencies and liberalization of interpretation), but disagreed on the reasoning for continuing this practices as well as on the validity of specific leniencies. Two of the opinions reflect reasoning similar to the respective Orthodox views (Biblical requirements or rabbinic ordinances enacted in remembrance of the Temple.) A third opinion expressed the view that Conservative Judaism should disconnect ritual purity practices from the Temple in Jerusalem or its memory, and offered a new approach based on what it called the concept of holiness rather than the concept of purity. Thus, Conservative ideology, under its philosophy of pluralism, supports a range of views on this subject, from views similar to the Orthodox view to views expressing a need for a contemporary reorientation. Most Conservative Jews do not observe the laws of niddah.

== Contemporary historical and scholarly commentary ==

According to the editors of the 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], the phrase ''netilat yadaim'' referring to washing of the hands, literally "lifting of the hands", is derived either from [[Book of Psalms|Psalm]] 134:2, or from the Greek word ''natla'' (αντλίον in Hebrew נַטְלָה), in reference to the jar of water used.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; The Jewish Encyclopedia states that many historic Jewish writers, and particularly the Pharisees, took it to mean that water had to be poured out onto uplifted hands, and that they could not be considered clean until water had reached the wrist.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; This is commented on by the [[Synoptic Gospels]], which state that these groups didn't eat until they had washed their hands to the wrist,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|7:3|}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Gospels castigates them for this, arguing that it was only followed as an ostentatious tradition, ignoring religious obligations,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|7:5-9|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that washing the hands was worthless without inward religious obligations also being adhered to, and insignificant if the inward obligations, such as giving all of one's possessions to the poor, were followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|7:37-41|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Jewish Encyclopedia, the historic requirement for priests to first wash their hands, together with the classical rabbinical belief that non-priest were also required to wash their hands before taking part in a holy act, such as prayer, was adhered to very strongly, to the extent that Christianity adopted the practice, and provided worshippers with fountains and basins of water in Churches, in a similar manner to the "[[Molten Sea]]" in the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem Temple]] functioning as a laver.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|30:18|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|4:2-6|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Christianity did not adopt the requirement for priests to wash feet before worship, in [[Islam]] the practice was extended to the congregation and expanded into [[wudu]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

According to [[Peake's Commentary on the Bible]], Biblical scholars regard the requirement of [[Kohanim]] washing their hands prior to the [[Priestly Blessing]] as an example of the [[taboo]] against the profane making contact with the sacred,&lt;ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible"/&gt; and similar practices are present in other religions of the period and region.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; The Jewish Encyclopedia relates that according to [[Herodotus]] the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] priests were required to wash themselves twice a day and twice a night in cold water,&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, 2:37&lt;/ref&gt; and according to [[Hesiod]] the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] were forbidden from pouring out the ''black wine'' to any deity in the morning, unless they had first washed their hands.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''[[Works and Days]]'', 722&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1906 Jewish encyclopedia, The [[Letter of Aristeas]] states that creators of the [[Septuagint]] washed their hands in the sea each morning before prayer;&lt;ref&gt;Aristeas 305&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephus]] states that this custom was the reason for the traditional location of [[synagogue]]s near water.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'', 14:10:23&lt;/ref&gt;
Biblical scholars regard this custom as an imitation by the laity of the behaviour of the priests.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; A [[baraita]] offers, as justification for the ritual of hand-washing after waking, the belief that a spirit of impurity rests upon each person during the night, and will not leave until the person's hands are washed,&lt;ref&gt;Baraita in ''Shabbat'' 109a&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Zohar]] argues that body is open to demonic possession during sleep because the [[soul]] temporarily leaves the body during it;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; the [[kabbalah]] argues that death awaits anyone who walks more than four [[yard]]s from their bed without ablution.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; According to {{Specify|date=May 2007}}, the cup containing the water has to be able to carry a certain amount {{Specify|date=May 2007}} of water, and it should have two handles{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}.

According to Peake's commentary on the Bible, the Priestly Code specifies that individuals were ''washed'' before they could become members of the Jewish priesthood,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|29:1-4|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly requires Levites to be ''cleansed'' before they assume their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|8:15|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Peake's commentary states that although Biblical rules regarding ritual purification following bodily discharges clearly have [[sanitation|sanitory]] uses, they ultimately originated from the [[taboo]]s against contact with [[blood]] and [[semen]], due to the belief that these contained life, more than any other bodily fluid, or any other aspect of the body.&lt;ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible"/&gt;

Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]] in ''Waters of Life'' connects the laws of impurity to the narrative in the beginning of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. According to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], Adam and Eve had brought death into the world by eating from the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]]. Kaplan points out that most of the laws of impurity relate to some form of death (or in the case of ''[[niddah]]'' the loss of a potential life). One who comes into contact with one of the forms of death must then immerse in water which is described in Genesis as flowing out of the Garden of Eden (the source of life) in order to cleanse oneself of this contact with death (and by extension of sin).&lt;ref&gt;[[Aryeh Kaplan]], ''Waters of Life''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japanese, {{nihongo|'''saisen'''|[[wikt:賽銭|賽銭]]}} is money offered to the [[Kami|gods]] or [[bodhisattvas]]. Commonly this money is put in a {{nihongo|''saisen'' box|[[wikt:賽銭箱|賽銭箱]]|saisen-bako}}, a common item at [[Shinto shrine]]s and [[Buddhist temples in Japan]].

Used to collect offerings, a ''saisen'' box is typically a wooden coin box, with a grate for the top cover. This design allows coins to be tossed in, while still preventing the money from being retrieved easily. Some have grates made of round bars, or have borders that slope downward, allowing the money to slide into the box easily.

{{History of Iran}}
The '''Sajid dynasty''' ({{lang-fa|ساجیان}}), was an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] Muslim dynasty that ruled from 889-890 until 929. Sajids ruled Azerbaijan and parts of Armenia first from [[Maragha]] and [[Barda, Azerbaijan|Barda]] and then from [[Ardabil]].{{efn|"For nearly forty years, until the killing of Fatḥ b. Moḥammad b. Abi’l-Sāj in 317/929, members of the family ruled Azerbaijan and Armenia first from Marāḡa and Barḏaʿa and then from Ardabīl. They reduced refractory Armenian princes to submission, but themselves sporadically withheld allegiance to Baghdad and suspended the payment of tribute; after the end of the Sajids, direct caliphal control was never restored in northwestern Iran."&lt;ref name="Bosworth" /&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Bosworth"&gt;''Azerbaijan IV'', C.E. Bosworth, ''Encyclopaedia Iranica'', December 15, 1987.[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/azerbaijan-iv]&lt;/ref&gt; The Sajids originated from the [[Central Asian]] province of [[Ushrusana]] and were of Iranian ([[Sogdian people|Sogdian]])&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Edmund Bosworth, The New Islamic Dynasties: A Chronological and Genealogical Manual, Columbia University, 1996. pg 147: "The Sajids were a line of caliphal governors in north-western Persia, the family of a commander in the 'Abbasid service of Soghdian descent which became culturally Arabised."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Minorsky, Studies in Caucasian history, Cambridge University Press, 1957. pg 111&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|"In ca. 279/892 the caliph Moʿtażed appointed one of his generals, Moḥammad b. Abi’l-Sāj, an Iranian from Central Asia, as governor of Azerbaijan and Armenia, and the family of the Sajids"&lt;ref name="Bosworth" /&gt;}} descent. Muhammad ibn Abi'l-Saj Diwdad the son of Diwdad, the first Sajid ruler of Azerbaijan, was appointed as its ruler in 889 or 890. Muhammad's father [[Abu'l-Saj Devdad]] had fought under the Ushrusanan prince [[Afshin (Caliphate General)|Afshin Khaydar]] during the latter's final campaign against the rebel [[Babak Khorramdin]] in Azerbaijan, and later served the caliphs. Toward the end of the 9th century, as the central authority of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] weakened, Muhammad was able to form a virtually independent state. Much of the Sajids' energies were spent in attempting to take control of neighboring [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Armenia]]. The dynasty ended with the death of Abu'l-Musafir al-Fath in 929.

The '''thunderbird''' is a [[legendary creature]] in certain [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|North American indigenous peoples']] history and culture.  It is considered a supernatural being of power and strength.  It is especially important, and frequently depicted, in the art, songs and oral histories of many [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Pacific Northwest Coast]] cultures, but is also found in various forms among some peoples of the [[American Southwest]], [[East Coast of the United States]], [[Great Lakes]], and [[Plains Indians|Great Plains]].

In [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] mythology, the thunderbird controls the upper world while the underworld is controlled by the [[underwater panther]] or [[Horned Serpent#In Native American cultures|Great Horned Serpent]]. The thunderbird throws lightning at the underwater creatures and creates thunder by flapping its wings.&lt;ref name="Alg"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Enduring Icon: A Wampanoag Thunderbird on an Eighteenth Century English Manuscript From Martha's Vineyard | author=Bouck, Jill and James B.

This varies from a simple X to recognizable birds.&lt;ref name="Alg" /&gt; The X-shaped thunderbird is often used to depict  the thunderbird with its wings alongside its body and the head facing forwards instead of in profile.&lt;ref name="NE Art"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Thunderbird Motif in Northeastern Indian Art | author=Lenik, Edward J. | journal=Archaeology of Eastern North America | year=2012 | volume=40 | pages=163–185 | jstor=23265141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Menominee===
The [[Menominee]] of Northern Wisconsin tell of a great mountain that floats in the western sky on which dwell the thunderbirds. They control the rain and hail and delight in fighting and deeds of greatness. They are the enemies of the great horned snakes - the Misikinubik - and have prevented these from overrunning the earth and devouring mankind. They are messengers of the Great Sun himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lankford|first=George E.|title=Native American Legends of the Southeast: Tales from the Natchez, Caddo, Biloxi, Chickasaw, and other Nations|year=2011|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa, AL|page=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cs383Ik3CAQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Thunderbird&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ojibwe]] version of the myth states that the thunderbirds were created by [[Nanabozho]] for the purpose of fighting the underwater spirits. They were also used to punish humans who broke moral rules. The thunderbirds lived in the [[Cardinal direction#Americas|four directions]] and arrived with the other birds in the springtime. In the fall they migrated south after the ending of the underwater spirits' most dangerous season.&lt;ref name="Ojibwa"&gt;{{cite book | title=Traditional Ojibwa Religion and Its Historical Changes | publisher=American Philosophical Society | author=Vecsey, Christopher | year=1983 | pages=75 | volume=152 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Un5uxow5c-UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Thunderbird&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toba Khedoori''' (born 1964 in [[Australia]]) is an artist of [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] heritage, known primarily for highly detailed mixed-media paintings executed on large sheets of wax-coated paper.

==Biography==
Khedoori was born in [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]] of Jewish-Iraqi parentage and raised in [[Australia]], and currently lives and works in [[Los Angeles, California]]. She received her MFA from UCLA in 1994. She is the [[identical twin]] sister of artist [[Rachel Khedoori]].&lt;ref name="NYT Art in Review"&gt;Roberta Smith (March 05, 1999) [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/05/arts/art-in-review-rachel-khedoori.html "Art in Review; Rachel Khedoori"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artwork==
Characteristically, Khedoori's works have comprised intricate details, models or architectural renderings set within the broad expanses of waxed paper or linen. This delicate combination frequently necessitates close viewing which results, then, in the works filling the spectator's entire field of vision. In recent years, Khedoori's works have introduced inversions of the more usual black detail on white expanse, incorporated natural imagery and landscape, and also taken the form of dramatically smaller-scale works than those hitherto produced. Her most recent output has also moved from wax-on-paper into oil and canvas, with subject matter drawing influence from geometric sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corwin|first=William|title=Toba Khedoori|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=October 2012|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2012/10/artseen/toba-khedoori}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Transcendental Meditation movement''' (also referred to as [[Transcendental Meditation]] or TM) refers to the programs and organizations connected with the Transcendental Meditation technique founded by [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] in India in the 1950s.

The TM movement also operates a worldwide network of Transcendental Meditation teaching centers, schools, universities, health centers, and herbal supplement, solar panel, and home financing companies, plus several TM-centered communities.

For example, TM is simply – as they state – a technique. Although it enables one to cope with life, it offers no goal beyond human existence (such as moksha), nor does it offer rites or passage or an ethic. Unlike certain other Hindu-derived movements, TM does not prescribe a dharma to its followers – that is to say a set of spiritual obligations deriving from one's essential nature.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Transcendental Meditation}}

Maharishi Mahesh Yogi began teaching Transcendental Meditation in India in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite book|last=Olson|first=Helena, Roland|title=His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi: A Living Saint for the New Millennium: Stories of His First Visit to the USA|year=March 2007 /reprint|publisher=Samhita Productions|isbn=978-1-929297-21-4|pages=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maharishi began a series of world  tours in 1958 to promote his meditation technique.&lt;ref name="Oates"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oates|first=Robert|title=Celebrating the Dawn: Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and the TM technique|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEwQAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Celebrating+the+dawn%3A+Maharishi+Mahesh+Yogi+and+the+TM+technique.&amp;q=1958#search_anchor|year=2006 |publisher=Putnam|isbn=978-0-399-11815-9|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting publicity generated by the Maharishi, the celebrities who learned the technique and the scientific research into its effect, helped popularize the technique in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1970s the Maharishi introduced advanced meditative techniques and his movement grew to encompass TM programs for schools, universities and prisons. In the 1980s additional programs aimed at improved health and well-being were developed based on the Maharishi's interpretation of the Vedic traditions. By the late 2000s, TM had been taught to millions of individuals and the Maharishi oversaw a large multinational movement which has continued since his death in 2008. The Maharishi's obituary in the ''[[New York Times]]'' credited the TM movement as being "a founding influence on what has grown into a multibillion-dollar self-help industry".&lt;ref name=Koppel2008 /&gt;

==Practitioners and participants==
The TM movement has been described as a "global movement" that utilizes its own international policies and transports its "core members" from country to country.{{sfn|Gablinger|2010}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}} It is said to be a "world affirming" and "accommodating" movement that does not seek to interfere with its member's involvement in their various religions.{{sfn|Gablinger|2010}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}

In 2008, ''The New York Times'', reported that TM's "public interest" had continued to grow in the 1970s" however, some practitioners were discouraged "by the organization's promotion of ....Yogic Flying."&lt;ref name=Koppel2008&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/world/asia/06maharishi-1.html |title=Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Spiritual Leader, Dies – New York Times |work= The New York Times|accessdate= May 26, 2010| first=Lily | last=Koppel | date=February 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was estimated to have  900,000 participants worldwide in 1977 according to new religious movement scholars Stark, Bainbridge and Sims.&lt;ref name="Stark 1985 page 287"/&gt; That year the  TM movement said there were 394 TM centers in the U.S., that about half of the 8,000 trained TM teachers were still active, and that one million Americans had been taught the technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TM Ruled Religious, Banned in Schools|first=JOHN|last=DART|work=Los Angeles Times|date=29 October 1977|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was reported to have a million participants by the 1980s,&lt;ref name=Petersen/&gt;&lt;ref name="Occhiogrosso, Peter 1996 p 66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bainbridge, William Sims 1997 page 189"/&gt; and modern day estimates range between four and ten million practitioners worldwide.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin Hodgson 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maharishi Mahesh Yogi 1955"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie van den Berg, ''Sydney Morning Herald'', Beatles guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi dies, (7 February 2008) "the TM movement, which has some five million followers worldwide"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meditation a magic bullet for high blood pressure – study, Sunday Tribune (South Africa), (27 January 2008) "More than five million people have learned the technique worldwide, including 60,000 in South Africa."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bank makes an issue of mystic's mint|last=Bickerton|first=Ian|work=Financial Times|location=London (UK)|date=8 February 2003|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Financial Times]] (2003), 5 million, {{cite news|title=Bank makes an issue of mystic's mint|last=Bickerton|first=Ian|work=Financial Times|location=London (UK)|date=8 February 2003|page=9}}; [[Asian News International]] (2009), 4 million {{cite news|title=David Lynch to shoot film about TM guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in India|work=The Hindustan Times|location=New Delhi|date=18 November 2009|agency=Asian News International}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1998, the country with the largest percentage of TM practitioners was Israel, where 50,000 people had learned the technique since its introduction in the 1960s, according members of the TM movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Peace of Mind|first=Esther|last=Hecht|work=Jerusalem Post|date=23 January 1998|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the ''Belfast Telegraph'' reported that an estimated 200,000 Britons practiced TM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mystic who inspired the Beatles: the town that lost its guru|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/mystic-who-inspired-the-beatles-the-town-that-lost-its-guru-13383285.html|work=Belfast Telegraph |date=7 February 2008|first=Emily |last=Dugan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TM movement is said to{{by whom|date=April 2016}} have a flexible structure that allows varying degrees of commitment.{{sfn|Gablinger|2010}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}  Many are satisfied with their "independent practice of TM" and don't seek any further involvement with the organization.{{sfn|Gablinger|2010}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}  For many TM practitioners their meditation is "one of many [[New Age]] products that they consume." Other practitioners are "dedicated" but are also critical of the organization. Still others, are "highly devoted" and participate in "mass meditations" at Maharishi University of Management, perform administrative activities or engage in a monastic lifestyle.  Likewise the organization has a "loose organisational heirarchy [''sic''] ".{{sfn|Gablinger|2010}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}} Transcendental Meditators who participate in group meditations at [[Maharishi University of Management]] are referred to as "Citizens of the Age of Enlightenment".&lt;ref name=Williamsonp96/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilpin|first=Geoff|title=The Maharishi Effect: A Personal Journey Through the Movement that Transformed American Spirituality|publisher=J.P.

'''Transcendental Meditation in education''' (also known as Consciousness Based Education) is the application of the Transcendental Meditation technique in an educational setting or institution. These educational programs and institutions have been founded in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, India, Africa and Japan.

Article 11 of the articles of incorporation read: "this corporation is a religious one.

(2000) ''Pluralism Comes of Age: American Religious Culture in the Twentieth Century'', page 112&lt;/ref&gt; According to British author [[Una Kroll]], SRM was not a community and in the early 1970s the organization "cast off its semi-religious clothing and pursued science in a big way".&lt;ref name="Una Kroll"&gt;Kroll, Una (1974) John Knox Press, The Healing Potential of Transcendental Meditation, chapter 1: The Guru, page 135&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012 the [[Pioneer News Service]], New Delhi, reported that several trusts, including the SRM Foundation of India, had become "non-functional" after the death of the Maharishi in 2008 and were immersed in controversy after trust members alleged that parcels of land had been "illegally sold off" by other trust members without proper authorization.&lt;ref&gt;Author unknown (23 January 2012)  [http://dailypioneer.com/nation/37262-members-breach-yogi-trusts-with-land-deal.html Members breach Yogi trusts with land deal], ''Pioneer News Service'' | New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt; In June the dispute was reported to be specifically between members of the SRM Foundation India, board of directors, over control of the foundation's assets, including 12,000 acres of land spread around India.  The two factions had accused each other of forging documents and selling land for "personal gains" without the sanction of the entire 12-member board. The two parties petitioned the Indian courts for a stay of all land sales until the Department and the Ministry of Home Affairs could conduct an investigation of the alleged improprieties. The newspaper went on to report that only four years after the Maharishi's death, his Indian legacy was "in tatters".

In 1985, a civil suit were filed against the World Plan Executive Council, in the United States by Robert Kropinski, Jane Greene, Patrick Ryan and Diane Hendel&lt;ref&gt;United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Civil Suit #85-2848, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; claiming [[fraud]] and psychological, physical, and emotional harm as a result of the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi programs. The district court dismissed Kropinski's claims concerning intentional [[tort]] and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and referred the claims of fraud and negligent infliction of physical and psychological injuries to a [[jury]] trial. The jury awarded Kropinski $137,890 in the fraud and negligence claims. The [[appellate court]] overturned the award and dismissed Kropinski's claim alleging psychological damage. The claim of fraud and the claim of a physical injury related to his practice of the TM-Sidhi program were remanded to the lower court for retrial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/853/853.F2d.948.87-7060.87-7033.html] Kropinski v.

In affirming the dismissal, the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit held that Hendel's claims were time-barred under the discovery rule because "...the defendants made representations which any reasonable person would recognize as being contrary to common human experience and, indeed, to the laws of physics. If, as Ms. Hendel alleges, she was told that meditators would slowly rise in the air, and that some of them were 'flying over Lake Lucern' or 'walking through walls, hovering, and becoming invisible,' and that her failure to go to bed on time could bring about World War III, then a reasonable person would surely have noticed, at some time prior to September 1, 1986, that some of these representations might not be true."&lt;ref&gt;Hendel v World Plan Executive Council, 124 WLR 957 (2 January 1996); affd 705 A.2d 656, 667 (DC, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
The public presentation of the TM technique has varied over its 50 year history. Some authors have praised its methods and success while others have criticized its marketing techniques. For example author G. Francis Xavier writes, the Maharishi is "one of the best salesman" and has made full use of the mass media to propagate TM around the world&lt;ref&gt;Xavier, G. Francis, (2006)  Pustak Mahal Publishers, Yoga For Health &amp; Personality, page 100&lt;/ref&gt; while authors Bainbridge and Stark criticize the TM movement for using endorsements from the scientific establishment as "propaganda", reprinting favorable articles and using positive statements by government officials in conjunction with their publicity efforts.&lt;ref name=Market85/&gt; On the other hand, cardiologist [[Stephen Sinatra]] and professor of medicine Marc Houston have said of the Maharishi: "His emphasis on scientific research proved that the timeless practice of meditation was not just an arcane mystical activity for Himalayan recluses, but rather a mind-body method hugely relevant to and beneficial for modern society".&lt;ref name="James Dalen 2011 237"&gt;{{Cite book| author = James Dalen | editor = Stephen  Devries| title = Integrative Cardiology | year = 2011 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | id = 978-0195383461 | pages = 237 | chapter = The Integrative Approach to Hypertension, Ch. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
According to one account, the Maharishi beginning in 1959, began "building an infrastructure" using a "mass marketing model" for teaching the TM technique to Westerners.&lt;ref name=Micozzi /&gt; First, the Maharishi visited the U.S. because he felt that its people were ready to try something new, and the rest of the world would then "take notice".&lt;ref name=Goldberg /&gt; By the same token, author Philip Goldberg says the Maharishi's insistence that TM was easy to do was not a "marketing ploy", but rather "a statement about the nature of the mind." &lt;ref name=Goldberg /&gt; In 1963 the Maharishi published his first book on Transcendental Meditation called ''The Science of Being and Art of Living''.  In the mid-1960s, the TM organization began presenting its meditation to students via a campaign led by a man named Jerry Jarvis who had taken the TM course in 1961.&lt;ref name=Goldberg /&gt; By 1966, the Students Meditation Society (SIMS) had begun programs in U.S. colleges such as [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[Harvard]], [[Yale]] and others, and was a "phenomenal success".&lt;ref name=Goldberg /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woo, Elaine (6 February 2006) "Maharishi Mahesh Yogi", ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, the TM technique received "major publicity" through its associations with [[The Beatles]], and by identifying itself with various aspects of modern day [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]].&lt;ref name="Bajpai, R.S. 2002 page 554"&gt;Bajpai, R.S. (2002) Atlantic Publishers, The Splendours And Dimensions Of Yoga 2 Vols. Set, page 554&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Stephen and Cornacchia, Harold J. (1980) ''Consumer Health: A Guide to Intelligent Decisions'', page 106&lt;/ref&gt; However, Goldberg and others say that during the first decade of the TM organization, the Maharishi's main students in the West were not rock stars and their fans, but ordinary, middle-aged citizens. In the late 60's, young people coming to learn TM at the center in London, England, were surprised  "to be greeted not by fellow hippies but by the proper, middle-aged men and women who were Maharishi's earliest followers."&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Phillip (2011) Harmony Books, American Veda, page 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mason|first=Paul|title=The Maharishi: The Biography of the Man Who Gave Transcendental Meditation to the West |year=1994 |publisher=Element|location=Dorset, UK |isbn=1-85230-571-1|page=80|quote=Meditators came from diverse backgrounds, but the majority were from the white middle classes, and many had no previous experience with spiritual organizations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another author notes that, "By the time the Beatles first met the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in London in 1966, Mahesh had already made seven trips around the globe, established 38 centres, and amassed more than 100,000 followers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Winston|first=Diane|title=Oxford Handbook of Religion and the American News Media |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCCja27G0AAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Oxford+Handbook+of+Religion+and+the+American+News+Media.#v=onepage&amp;q=100%2C000&amp;f=false |accessdate=|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-539506-9 |page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[The Beatles in India|Lennon and Harrison were in India]] in 1968 there were tensions with the Maharishi over business negotiations for a proposed documentary film and television show. The Beatles were surprised to find the Maharishi was a sophisticated negotiator&lt;ref name=BrownGaines195&gt;Brown &amp; Gaines (1984) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; with an interest in publicity, business and finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lennon|first=Cynthia|authorlink=Cynthia Lennon|title=John|date=27 September 2005|publisher=Crown|isbn=978-0-307-33855-6|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TM is said to have taken full advantage of all available publicity, and began to market to specific populations, such as spiritual people, political people and "pragmatic" self-help people. The latter approach is said to have been "given impetus" by the scientific research on the technique.&lt;ref name="Blatter" /&gt; In ''The Future of Religion'', sociologists Bainbridge and Stark write that, while the movement attracted many people through endorsements from celebrities such as The Beatles, another marketing approach was "getting articles published in scientific journals, apparently proving TM's claims or at least giving them scientific status".&lt;ref name=Market85&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bainbridge, Sims |author2=Stark, Rodney |author3=Bainbridge, William Sims |title=The Future of Religion: Secularization, Revival, and Cult Formation |publisher=Univ. of California Press |location=Berkeley, Calif |year=1985 |pages=|isbn=0-520-05731-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTzPyvT2yusC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;dq=public+relations+Transcendental+meditation#v=onepage&amp;q=public%20relations%20Transcendental%20meditation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, according to Philip Goldberg, the Maharishi began encouraging research on the TM technique because he felt that hard scientific data would be a useful marketing tool and a way to re-brand meditation as a scientific form of deep rest, rather than a mystical "samadhi"; one of his first steps in secularizing the technique.&lt;ref name=Goldberg /&gt; The Maharishi's "appropriation of science was clearly part of his agenda from the beginning" says Goldberg, and so his "organization was incorporated as an educational non-profit, not a religious one".&lt;ref name=Goldberg /&gt; The Maharishi asked people with marketing expertise, like SIMS president, Jarvis, to present TM as a method for inner peace and relaxation based on scientific proof &lt;ref name=Yamamoto /&gt; and, because the TM technique was the first type of meditation to undergo scientific testing, it "has always received the most publicity".&lt;ref name=Micozzi /&gt;

The first peer-reviewed research on TM, conducted by physiologist Robert K. Wallace at UCLA, appeared in the journal ''Science'' in 1970. It attracted significant public and scientific attention. The study's findings were also published in the ''American Journal of Physiology'' in 1971, in ''Scientific American'' in 1972,{{sfn|Freeman|2009|p=163}} and reported in ''Time'' magazine in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mind over drugs|url=|page=47|newspaper=Time|date=25 October 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between mid-1970 and 1974, the number of research insititutions conducting research on TM grew from four to over 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kanellakos|first=Demetri P |author2=Jerome S Lukas |title=The Psychobiology of Transcendental Meditation: A Literature Review |date=July 1974 |publisher=W.A.

Several researchers have said that Maharishi's encouragement of research on TM resulted in a beneficial increase in the scientific understanding of not only TM but of meditation in general, resulting in the increased use of meditation to alleviate health problems and to improve mind and body.&lt;ref name="James Dalen 2011 237" /&gt;  Neuroscientists Ronald Jevning and James O’Halloran wrote in 1984 that "The proposal of the existence of a unique or fourth state of consciousness with a basis in physiology" by the Maharishi in 1968 was "a major contribution to the study of human behavior" resulting in "a myriad of scientific studies both basic and applied in an area heretofore reserved for ‘mysticism'." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jevning|first1=Ronald|authorlink1=|last2=O'Halloran|first2=James P|editor1-first=Deane H |editor1-last=Shapiro |editor2-first=Roger |editor2-last=Walsh |title=Meditation: Classic and Contemporary Perspectives|year=1984|publisher=Aldine Publishing Company|location=Hawthorne, New York|language=|isbn=0-202-25136-5 |page=470 |chapter=Chapter 33: Metabolic Effects of Transcendental Meditation: Toward a New Paradigm of Neurobiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research reviews of the effects of the Transcendental Meditation technique have yielded results ranging from inconclusive&lt;ref name=Cochrane06 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ospina&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ospina |first1=MB. |last2=Bond |first2=K. |last3=Karkhaneh |first3=M. |last4=Tjosvold |first4=L. |last5=Vandermeer |first5=B. |last6=Liang |first6=Y. |last7=Bialy |first7=L. |last8=Hooton |first8=N. |last9=Buscemi |first9=N. |last10=Dryden |first10=D.

According to Bainbridge and Stark, TM had engaged in several mass media campaigns prior to 1973, and had received a great amount of publicity, but the main source of new TM students was word of mouth, or the "advice of friends", because "TM was a relatively cheap, short-term service, requiring no deep commitment".&lt;ref&gt;Bainbridge, 313&lt;/ref&gt; Author Jack Forem agrees, and writes: "the main source of publicity for the movement has been satisfied practitioners spreading the news by word of mouth".&lt;ref name="Forem"&gt;Forem, Jack (1984) Unwin Paperbacks, ''Transcendental Meditation: Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and the Science of Creative Intelligence'', page 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, [[Maharishi International University]] (MIU) faculty member, Michael Peter Cain co-wrote a book with [[Harold Bloomfield]] and Dennis T.

The TM movement's area coordinator, Jack Forem, published his book ''Transcendental Meditation, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and the Science of Creative Intelligence'' in 1976.&lt;ref name="Forem" /&gt; That year, TM teacher, Peter Russell, released his book ''An Introduction to Transcendental Meditation and the Teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi'' as did MIU board of trustees member, [[Nat Goldhaber]] who wrote ''TM: An alphabetical guide to the transcendental meditation program''.

According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', since 2008 there has been an increased number of celebrity endorsements for Transcendental Meditation. Those who have appeared at promotional events to raise funds to teach TM to students, veterans, prisoners and others include comedian/actor [[Russell Brand]], TV host/physician [[Mehmet Oz]], and singer [[Moby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Irina |last=Aleksander |title=Look Who's Meditating Now |work=New York Times |date=18 March 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/fashion/20TM.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A benefit performance in New York City in 2009 included a reunion performance by musicians [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Ringo Starr]], [[Donovan]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Bettye LaVette]], [[Ben Harper]], [[Paul Horn (musician)|Paul Horn]], and [[Mike Love]].

===Reception to Marketing===
In 1988, author J. Isamu Yamamoto wrote that "TM was called the McDonald's of meditation because of its extravagantly successful packaging of Eastern Meditation for the American mass market".&lt;ref name=Yamamoto&gt;Yamamoto, J. Isamu, Hinduism, TM, and Hare Krishna ( 1998) Zondervan Publishing, page 16&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1980 book, ''TM and Cult Mania'', scientists associated with TM have attempted to prove the Maharishi's concepts by uniting scientific data and mystical philosophy.&lt;ref name=Persinger/&gt; The 2010 book, ''Teaching Mindfulness'', says that TM's eventual success as a new social movement was based on the "translation in Western language and settings, popular recognition, adoption within scientific research in powerful institutions." The book goes on to say that TM's "use of sophisticated marketing and public relations techniques, represents a model for success in the building of new social movements".&lt;ref name="Blatter"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Micozzi&gt;{{cite book |author1=Donald McCown |author2=Diane C.

Johnston says that TM's "calculated strategies" have led to its "rapid growth". In particular, it has objectified the rank-and-file membership, marketed the movement as a product, and created a perception of grievances for which it offers a panacea.&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Marketed Social Movement: A Case Study of the Rapid Growth of TM|first=Hank |last=Johnston|journal=The Pacific Sociological Review|volume=23|issue=3|date= July 1980|pages=333–354 |publisher=University of California Press|jstor=1388826}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book, ''The Field'', author [[Lynne McTaggart]] notes that the "organization has been ridiculed, largely because of the promotion of the Maharishi's own personal interests", but suggests that "the sheer weight of data...[on the Maharishi Effect]...is compelling".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = HarperCollins| isbn = 978-0-06-093117-9| page = 211 |last = McTaggart| first = Lynne| title = The Field| date = 24 July 2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?d=uivwpQIRMwUC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=transcendental+meditation&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=transcendental%20meditation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article in The Independent, despite early criticism, the TM technique has moved from margin to mainstream, due mostly to its "burgeoning body of scientific research". Its recent appeal seems due to the possibility of relaxation with no chemical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Independent|title=Transcendental Meditation: Were the hippies right all along?|first=Laura|last=Tennant|date=10 July 2011|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/transcendental-meditation-were-the-hippies-right-all-along-2307898.html}} "TM, as its followers call it, is rapidly moving from kooky margin to respectable mainstream thanks largely to a burgeoning body of scientific research.".."While the research on the health benefits of TM is fascinating, there's another, more compelling, reason why meditation is in the air just now. Done consistently, it seems to offer some sort of corrective to modernity, a respite from anxiety and the ability to really, truly relax, without chemical assistance"&lt;/ref&gt;  Jerrold Greenberg in his book ''Comprehensive Stress Management'' writes that the Maharishi was a "major exporter of meditation to the Western world" who "developed a large, worldwide, and highly effective organization to teach Transcendental Meditation". Greenberg goes on to say that "the simplicity of this technique, coupled with the effectiveness of its marketing by TM organizations quickly led to its popularity."&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Jerrold S. (2006) McGraw-Hill, Comprehensive Stress Management, page 170&lt;/ref&gt; According to Goldberg, research and meditation in general are likely to be the Maharishi's "lasting legacy".&lt;ref name=Goldberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldberg&gt;{{Cite book|last=Goldberg|first=Philip|year=2010|title=American Veda—How Indian Spirituality Changed the West|pages=151–175|publisher=Crown Publishing/Random House|location= New York|isbn=978-0-385-52134-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Purity of the Maharishi's teaching===
Maharishi wanted to maintain the purity of his teachings.{{sfn|Forsthoefel|Humes|2005}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}} He said that the "purity of the system of meditation" must be  maintained "at any cost because the effect lies in the purity of the teaching".&lt;ref name="name"/&gt; TM practitioners that are suspected of interacting with other gurus can be banned from meditations and lose other privileges.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; In the 1990s, Maharishi prohibited his students from interacting with [[Deepak Chopra]].{{sfn|Forsthoefel|Humes|2005|pp=55–80}} As a result, Lowe writes, the number of sufficiently orthodox practitioners was significantly reduced by 2007.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Neo-Hindu Transformation of an Iowa Town |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1525/nr.2010.13.3.81?uid=3739640&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101374882061|first=Scott |last=Lowe|journal=Nova Religio: the Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions|volume=13|issue=3|pages=81–91|issn=1092-6690 |year=2010|doi=10.1525/nr.2010.13.3.81}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1983, Robin Wadsworth Carlson began teaching his meditation program via a "World Teacher Seminar." Many students at Maharishi International University (MIU) were suspended after describing the literature promoting the seminar. In response Carlson filed a lawsuit against MIU alleging interference in conducting his seminars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iEIiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aa0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1334,1579296&amp;dq | last = Munns | first = Roger | title = Upstart stirring up the karma | publisher = Owosso Argus-Press | agency = Associated Press | work = news.google.com | date = 1983-07-21 | accessdate = 2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maharishi believed that in order to maintain the continuity of Transcendental Meditation it had to be taught by trained teachers in dedicated centers.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. ''The Science of Being and Art of Living''. Plume, New York, 2001. p298-307&lt;/ref&gt; Maharishi recorded his lectures; systematized the teaching of the technique, insisted the technique not be mixed with other techniques and separated the technique from other points of view and practices that might confuse its understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Russel, Peter. ''The TM Technique:A Skeptic's Guide To The TM Program.'' Routledge, Boston, 1977. pg15-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New religious movement===
George Chryssides identifies the TM movement as one of the  new religious movements "which lacks overtly religious features as traditionally understood" and whose focus is on human potential. He also describes the TM movement in terms of Roy Wallis's typological terms as a world affirming rather than world renouncing or world accommodating new religious movement.&lt;ref name="Chryssides/Exploring"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chryssides|first=George|title=Exploring New Religions|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0-304-33651-3 |pages=23|year=1999}}(Roy Wallis, 1985, page 5)&lt;/ref&gt; According to religious studies scholar, Tamar Gablinger, the "complex structure" of the TM organization falls somewhere  between being a commercial entity and a religious and social movement. Gablinger says this allows sociologists to categorize it in a variety of ways.{{sfn|Gablinger|2010}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}} Both Gablinger and sociologist Hank Johnston describe the TM organization as a "marketed social movement."{{sfn|Gablinger|2010}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref name="Johnston"/&gt;

===Connections to Hinduism===
{{Hinduism|collapsed=yes}} 
Author [[Noretta Koertge]] asserts that the TM movement introduced to the West the "[[scientistic]] version of Hinduism"; the idea that "the Vedas are simply another name for science".&lt;ref&gt;Noretta Koertge, ''Scientific values and civic virtues'', Oxford University Press US, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-19-517225-6}}, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; The TM movement has been described by Neusner as being a [[Hinduism in the West|neo-Hindu]] adaptation of classical [[Vedantic Hinduism]],&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Christine Rhally, ''The teaching of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as a Neo-Hindu version of Sankara's Vedanta: a modern stage in the development of Vedantic ideas'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;in Jacob Neusner, ''World Religions in America: An Introduction'', Westminster John Knox Press, 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-664-23320-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while  author Gerald James Larson says it retains "only shallow connections" to Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Cited as a "Neo-Hindu revisionist and internationalist movement" with "only shallow connections" to Hinduism in Gerald James Larson, ''India's agony over religion'', SUNY series in religious studies, 1995, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2412-4}}, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics charge that the TM movement is a bastardized form of [[Hinduism]] which denies its religious roots and claims a scientific basis for the purpose of securing government funding for its programs.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathan Fox |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2000-10-05/news/good-vibrations/ |title=Good Vibrations | publisher = Dallas Observer | work = DallasObserver.com |date=2000-10-05 |accessdate=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their book, ''Millennium, Messiahs and Mayhem: Contemporary Apocalyptic Movements'', Robbins and Palmer refer to the Maharishi's teaching that the practice of Transcendental Meditation will bring Ram Rajya (the rule of God) on earth as a form of progressive [[millennialism]] from the Hindu tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Robbins | first = Thomas | last2 = Palmer | first2 = Susan | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hffb1o4gr7oC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Maharishi+millennialism#v=onepage&amp;q=Maharishi%20millennialism&amp;f=false | title = Millennium, Messiahs and Mayhem: Contemporary Apocalyptic Movements | publisher = Routledge | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-415-91649-3 | work = Books.google.com | accessdate = 2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cult, sect, religion ===
Along with other movements that developed as part of the [[hippie subculture]] in the 1960s, there has been debate on "[[cult]]"-like aspects of the Transcendental Meditation movement.&lt;ref name=Persinger/&gt; [[Camille Paglia]] wrote that TM was the "major Asian cult" of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cults and Cosmic Consciousness: Religious Visions in the American 1960s|first=Camille|last=Paglia|authorlink=Camille Paglia|journal=[[Arion (journal)|Arion]]|series=Third|volume=10|issue=3|date=Winter 2003|publisher=Boston University|jstor=20163901|pages=57–111 [76]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli Center for Cult Victims also considers the movement to be a cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1150400.html |title=Women's tragedy – Haaretz – Israel News |work=Haaretz |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maharishi University says that it is not a religious institution but people who have left the movement refer to it as a cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/29/news/university-s-degree-comes-with-a-heavy-dose-of-meditation-and-skepticism.html?pagewanted=all |title=University's Degree Comes With a Heavy Dose of Meditation (and Skepticism) | work=The New York Times | first=Anthony | last=Depalma | date=29 April 1992 | accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the [[Cult Awareness Network]] (CAN) held a press conference and demonstration in Washington, D.C., saying that the organization that teaches the Transcendental Meditation technique "seeks to strip individuals of their ability to think and choose freely." [[Steven Hassan]], an author on the topic of cults, and at one time a CAN [[deprogrammer]], said at the press conference that members display cult-like behaviors, such as the use of certain language and particular ways of dressing. TM teacher and spokesperson, Dean Draznin, "discounted CAN's claims" saying that Transcendental Meditation "doesn't involve beliefs or lifestyle" or "mind control" and "We don't force people to take courses". Another spokesperson, Mark Haviland of the related College of Natural Law said that TM is "not a philosophy, a life style or a religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/trans_med/tm2.htm|title=Group Says Movement a Cult|work=[[The Washington Post]]|first=Phil|last=McCombs|date=2 July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Shirley Harrison says that the method of recruitment is one  sign that helps to identify cult, and that TM's only method is advertising. She also says that "none of the other 'cultic qualities' defined by cultwatchers can be fairly attributed to TM."{{sfn|Harrison|1990|pp=93-103}} Harrison writes that the Maharishi's teaching does not require conversion and that Transcendental Meditation does not have a religious creed.{{sfn|Harrison|1990}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}

In the book ''Cults and New Religions'', Cowan and Bromley write that TM is presented to the public as a meditation practice that has been validated by science but is not a religious practice nor is it affiliated with any religious tradition. They say that "although there are some dedicated followers of TM who devote most or all of their time to furthering the practice of Transcendental Meditation in late modern society, the vast majority of those who practice do so on their own, often as part of what has been loosely described as the New Age Movement. "{{sfn|Cowan|Bromley|2007|p=18}} They say that most scholars view Transcendental Meditation as having elements of both therapy and religion, but that on the other hand, "Transcendental Meditation has no designated scripture, no set of doctrinal requirements, no ongoing worship activity, and no discernible community of believers."  They also say that Maharishi didn't claim to have special divine revelation or supernatural personal qualities.{{sfn|Cowan|Bromley|2007}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}

[[Marc Galanter (psychiatrist)|Marc Galanter]], writes in his book ''[[Cults: Faith, Healing and Coercion]]'' that TM "evolved into something of a charismatic movement, with a belief system that transcended the domain of its practice". He notes how a variety of unreasonable beliefs came to be seen as literally true by its "more committed members". He cites an "unlikely set of beliefs" that includes the ability to levitate and reduce traffic accidents and conflicts in the Middle East through the practice of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKlkYgGo2cEC |first=Marc |last=Galanter |title=Cults: Faith, Healing and Coercion |page=65 |accessdate=15 November 2009 | isbn=978-0-19-512369-2 | year=1999 | publisher=Oxford University Press US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Soul snatchers: the mechanics of cults'', [[Jean-Marie Abgrall]] describes how Altered States Of Consciousness (ASCs) are used in many cults to make the initiate more susceptible to the group will and world view. He cites research by Barmark and Gautnitz which showed the similarities between the states obtained by Transcendental Meditation and ASCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Lévy | first1 = Bernard Henri. | title = What good are intellectuals? : 44 writers share their thoughts.. | year = 2000 | publisher = Algora Pub. | location = New York | isbn = 978-1-892941-10-7 | page = 164}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, not only does the subject become more reliant on the ASC, but it allows for a weakening of criticism of the cult and increase in faith therein. Abgrall goes on to note that the use of mantras is one of the most widespread techniques in cults, noting in TM this mantra is produced mentally.&lt;ref&gt;Abgrall p.174&lt;/ref&gt; He says that a guru is usually central to a cult and that its success will rely on how effective that guru is. Among the common characteristics of a [[guru]] he notes paraphrenia, a mental illness that completely cuts the individual from reality. In regard to this he notes for example, that the Maharishi recommended the TM-Sidhi program including 'yogic flying' as a way to reduce crime.&lt;ref&gt;Abgrall p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Elementary Forms of The New Religious Life'', [[Roy Wallis]] writes in the chapter called "Three Types of New Religious Movements" that TM is a "world affirming new religion" which does not reject the world and its organisation" [sic]. Wallis goes on to say that "no rigorous discipline is normally involved" and "no extensive doctrinal commitment is entailed, at least not at the outset". Likewise, he writes, "No one is required to declare a belief in TM, in the Maharishi or even in the possible effects of the technique".&lt;ref name="Wallis"&gt;Wallis, Roy (1984) Routledge and Kegan Paul, The Elementary Forms of the New Religious Lifepp 20-35&lt;/ref&gt; In a later chapter called "The Precariousness of the Market", he writes that TM meditators are "expected to employ the movement's rhetoric and conceptual vocabulary" and shift from an empirical product [the Transcendental Meditation technique] to a "system of belief and practice" [such as the TM Sidhi program] and in this way "the movement shifts from cult towards sect".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Wallis | first1 = Roy. | title = The elementary forms of the new religious lif | year = 1984 | publisher = Routledge Kegan Paul | location = London ; Boston | isbn = 978-0-7100-9890-0 | pages = 101–102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Alan E. Aldridge writes that Transcendental Meditation fits [[Roy Wallis]]' definition of a "[[World-affirming movements|world-affirming religion]]". According to Aldridge, TM has an ethos of "individual self-realization" and "an inner core of committed members" who practice more advanced techniques (the [[TM-Sidhi program]]) that may not even be known to the "ordinary consumer of TM".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| isbn = 978-0-7456-2083-1| last = Aldridge| first = Alan E| title = Religion in the contemporary world: a sociological introduction| year = 2000|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporter [[Michael D'Antonio]] wrote in his book, ''Heaven on Earth – Dispatches from America's Spiritual Frontier'' that, as practiced at [[Maharishi University of Management|Maharishi International University]], Transcendental Meditation is "a cult, not a culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = D'Antonio | first1 = Michael. | title = Heaven on earth | year = 1992 | publisher = Crown Publishers | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-517-57802-5 | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quotation needed|date=November 2012}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}} D'Antonio wrote that Transcendental Meditation was like the worst of religion: rigid, unreasonable, repressive, and authoritarian, characterized by overt manipulation, a disregard for serious scholarship, and an unwillingness to question authority. For the first time in his travels he found people he believed to be truly deluded, and a physics department teaching theories that were dead wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Casey|first=Constance|title=Gimme that new time religion|work=Washington Post|section=Book Reviews|date=2 February 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; D'Antonio charges that they have taken Transcendental Meditiation and transformed it "into a grandiose narcissistic dream, a form of intellectual bondage, that they call enlightenment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=txEVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SgMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6454,924527&amp;dq=d-antonio+tm+fairfield&amp;hl=en |last=Vallongo |first=Sally |title=Seeing New Age with a journalist's eye |work=Toledo Blade |page=10 |section=2 |date=4 April 1992 |accessdate=15 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke and Linzey argue that for the ordinary membership of TM their lives and daily concerns are little&amp;nbsp;— if at all&amp;nbsp;— affected by its cult nature. Instead, as is the case for [[Scientology]], it is only the core membership who must give total dedication to the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Clarke | first1 = Paul A.

He says those participants encounter "environments where adherents often weren't allowed to read the news or talk to family members".&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt; Another former TM Movement member, says there were "times when devotees had their mail screened and were monitored by a Vigilance Committee".  Another follower described these TM critics as a "microscopic group of troubled people" whose "mission in life is to be unhappy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-02-05/features/1993036037_1_mahesh-yogi-maharishi-mahesh-transcendental-meditation | last = Shane | first = Scott | title = Maharishi, Inc | publisher = Baltimore Sun | work = BaltimoreSun.com | date = 1993-02-05 | accessdate = 2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reporter for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' wrote in 2010 that he did not think the movement was a cult due to the lack of a cult leader and its well-meaning participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Sunday Times|location=London|title=Mantra with a mission; Feature Om or ominous?

{{For|the forms of the Mass liturgy prior to 1570|Pre-Tridentine Mass}}
[[File:Missa tridentina 002.jpg|270px|right|thumb|Elevation of the chalice after the consecration during a [[Solemn Mass]]]]

The '''Tridentine Mass''', also known as the '''Usus Antiquior''' and '''Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite''', is the [[Roman Rite]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] which appears in typical editions of the [[Roman Missal]] published from 1570 to 1962.&lt;ref&gt;In this context, "typical edition" means the officially approved edition to whose text other printings are obliged to conform.&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely used Mass liturgy in the world until the introduction of the [[Mass of Paul VI]] in 1969, it is celebrated in [[ecclesiastical Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=2786 Angelus A. De Marco, O.F.M., "Liturgical Languages" in ''The American Ecclesiastical Review'']&lt;/ref&gt; The 1962 edition is the most recent authorized text, also known as the Missal of [[Pope John XXIII|Saint John XXIII]] after the now-canonized [[Pope]] who promulgated it.

"Tridentine" is derived from the [[Latin]] ''Tridentinus'', "related to the city of Tridentum" (modern-day [[Trento|Trent]], Italy), where the [[Council of Trent]] was held. In response to a decision of that council,&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct25.html Council of Trent, session of 4 December 1563]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Pius V]] promulgated the 1570 Roman Missal, making it mandatory throughout the [[Latin Church]], except in places and [[religious order]]s with missals from before 1370.&lt;ref&gt;These regions included those in which a variant of the Roman Rite, called the [[Sarum Rite]], was in use for more than the minimum required time. On a few recent occasions Roman Catholic prelates have used this variant as an extraordinary form of celebrating Mass. However, like most of the other regions and the orders concerned, the Sarum Rite areas have adopted the standard Roman Missal. The most important non-Roman liturgies that continue in use are the [[Ambrosian Rite]], the [[Mozarabic Rite]] and the [[Latin liturgical rites#Carthusian Rite|Carthusian Rite]].&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being often described as "the (Traditional) Latin Mass", the [[Mass of Paul VI]] (the ''Novus Ordo Missae'') that replaced it as the Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite has its official text in Latin and is sometimes celebrated in that language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P39.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 928]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20040423_redemptionis-sacramentum_en.html Instruction ''Redemptionis Sacramentum'', 112]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] issued the ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'', accompanied by a letter to the world's bishops, authorizing use of the 1962 Tridentine Mass by all [[Latin Rite]] [[Catholic priests]] in Masses celebrated without the people. These Masses "may — observing all the norms of law — also be attended by faithful who, of their own free will, ask to be admitted".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/summorum-pontificum.html ''Summorum Pontificum''], articles 2 and 4&lt;/ref&gt; Permission for competent priests to use the Tridentine Mass as parish liturgies may be given by the pastor or rector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/summorum-pontificum.html ''Summorum Pontificum''], article 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Benedict stated that the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal is to be considered an "[[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite|extraordinary form]]" (''forma extraordinaria'')&lt;ref &lt;ref name="extraordinaria"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html Letter of Pope Benedict XVI]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Roman Rite, of which the 1970 Mass of Paul VI is the ordinary, normal or standard form. Since that is the only authorized extraordinary form, some refer to the 1962 Tridentine Mass as "the extraordinary form" of the Mass.&lt;ref&gt;Pope Benedict spoke of it instead as "an" extraordinary form. While in English, "extraordinary" often has laudatory overtones, its meaning in canon law is illustrated by its use with reference, for instance, to "the extraordinary minister of holy communion" (cf. [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P37.HTM#CL canon 910 §2] of the Code of Canon Law).&lt;/ref&gt; The 1962 Tridentine Mass is sometimes referred to as the "''usus antiquior''" (older use) or "''forma antiquior''" (older form),&lt;ref&gt;''Summorum Pontificum'', article 10 speaks of celebrations "iuxta formam antiquiorem ritus romani" (in accordance with the older form of the Roman Rite).&lt;/ref&gt; to differentiate it from the Mass of Paul VI, again in the sense of being the only one of the older forms for which authorization has been granted.

==Language==
In most countries, the language used for celebrating the Tridentine Mass was and is Latin. However, in [[Dalmatia]] and parts of [[Istria]] in [[Croatia]], the liturgy was celebrated in [[Church Slavonic]], and authorisation for use of this language was extended to some other Slavic regions between 1886 and 1935.&lt;ref name="CED"&gt;{{cite web |last= Krmpotic |first= M.D. |title=Dalmatia |year=1908 |accessdate=March 25, 2008 |publisher= [[Catholic encyclopedia]] |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04606b.htm |quote= The right to use the [[Glagolitic]] {{sic}} language at Mass with the Roman Rite has prevailed for many centuries in all the south-western Balkan countries, and has been sanctioned by long practice and by many popes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRD"&gt;{{cite web |last= Japundžić |first= Marko |title=The Croatian Glagolitic Heritage |year=1997 |accessdate=March 25, 2008 |publisher= Croatian Academy of America |url= http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/japun.html |quote= In 1886 it arrived to the [[Principality of Montenegro]], followed by the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] in 1914, and the [[Republic of Czechoslovakia]] in 1920, but only for [[feast days]] of the main [[patron saint]]s. The 1935 concordat with the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] anticipated the introduction of the Slavic liturgy for all Croatian regions and throughout the entire state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal, the 1964 Instruction on implementing the [[Sacrosanctum Concilium|Constitution on Sacred Liturgy]] of the [[Second Vatican Council]] laid down that "normally the epistle and gospel from the Mass of the day shall be read in the [[vernacular]]". [[Episcopal conference]]s were to decide, with the consent of the Holy See, what other parts, if any, of the Mass were to be celebrated in the vernacular.&lt;ref name="EWTN"&gt;{{cite web |title = ''Inter Oecumenici, Sacred Congregation of Rites |year = 2007 |url = http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDWINOEC.HTM |accessdate = March 25, 2008 |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], the vernacular language was introduced into the celebration of the Tridentine Mass by some [[Old Catholic]]s and [[Anglo-Catholic]]s with the introduction of the [[English Missal]].

Some [[Western Rite Orthodoxy|Western Rite Orthodox]] Christians, particularly in the Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of North America, use the Tridentine Mass in the vernacular with minor alterations under the title of the "Divine Liturgy of St. Gregory".

Most Old Catholics use the Tridentine Mass, either in the vernacular or in Latin.

==Terminology==

Leaning against the [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]] and two of the candlesticks are [[altar cards]], to remind the celebrant of the words when he is away from the missal]]
The Catholic Church uses the term ''extraordinary form of the Roman Rite Mass'' among other terms.&lt;ref name="extraordinaria" /&gt; The most widespread term for this form of the rite, other than "Tridentine Mass", is "Latin Mass". Likewise, the ordinary form of the Roman Rite Mass was promulgated in Latin and, except at Masses scheduled by the ecclesiastical authorities to take place in the language of the people, can everywhere be celebrated in that language.&lt;ref name="RS"&gt;{{cite web |author=Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacrament |title=Redemptionis Sacramentum |date=2004-04-23 |url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20040423_redemptionis-sacramentum_en.html |quote=Mass is celebrated either in Latin or in another language, provided that liturgical texts are used which have been approved according to the norm of law. Except in the case of celebrations of the Mass that are scheduled by the ecclesiastical authorities to take place in the language of the people, Priests are always and everywhere permitted to celebrate Mass in Latin |accessdate=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally the term "Gregorian Rite" is used when talking about the Tridentine Mass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2129070/Latin-mass-to-return-to-England-and-Wales.html |title=Latin mass to return to England and Wales |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2008-06-14 |accessdate=2008-06-17 |last= Thompson |first=Damian}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{discuss|section=Gregorian Rite?}} as is, more frequently, "Tridentine Rite".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/latinmass2.html Medieval Sourcebook]; [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080212213620/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0800689.htm Pope reformulates Tridentine rite's prayer for Jews]&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Benedict XVI declared it inappropriate to speak of the versions of the Roman Missal of before and after 1970 as if they were two rites. Rather, he said, it is a matter of a twofold use of one and the same rite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html Letter to the Bishops on the occasion of the publication of [[Summorum Pontificum]] ]&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[Byzantine_Rite#List_of_Churches_of_Byzantine_liturgical_tradition|Eastern Byzantine Churches]] the mass is known as the Divine Liturgy of Saint Gregory the Great.

[[Traditionalist Catholics]], whose best-known characteristic is an attachment to the Tridentine Mass, frequently refer to it as the "Traditional Mass" or the "Traditional Latin Mass". They describe as a "codifying" of the form of the Mass the preparation of Pius V's edition of the Roman Missal, of which he said that the experts to whom he had entrusted the work collated the existing text with ancient manuscripts and writings, restored it to "the original form and rite of the holy Fathers" and further emended it.&lt;ref name="QP"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius05/p5quopri.htm |title = Quo primum |accessdate = 2008-03-25 |quote = We decided to entrust this work to learned men of our selection. They very carefully collated all their work with the ancient codices in Our Vatican Library and with reliable, preserved or emended codices from elsewhere.

When this work has been gone over numerous times and ''further emended'', after serious study and reflection, We commanded that the finished product be printed and published.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To distinguish this form of Mass from the Mass of Paul VI, traditionalist Catholics sometimes call it the "Mass of the Ages",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0540.html The Mass of Vatican II]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://therambleronline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=86 The Mass of the Consilium and the Mass of the Ages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.remnantnewspaper.com/Archives/archive_2008_0515_god_was_worshipped_here_today.htm God Was Worshipped Here Today]{{dead link |date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailycatholic.org/holymass.htm Meditation before Holy Mass]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unavocela.org/noindult.htm Is the Novus Ordo Mass Actually the Indult Mass?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osjknights.com/priories.htm Priories of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem]&lt;/ref&gt; and say that it comes down to us "from the Church of the Apostles, and ultimately, indeed, from Him Who is its principal Priest and its spotless Victim".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120915074642/http://www.syonabbey.org/Publications/massapostles.html The Mass of the Apostles]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

== Pope St. Pius V's revision of the liturgy ==
At the time of the Council of Trent, the traditions preserved in printed and manuscript missals varied considerably, and standardization was sought both within individual dioceses and throughout the [[Latin West]]. Standardization was required also in order to prevent the introduction into the liturgy of Protestant ideas in the wake of the [[Protestant Reformation]].

Pope St. Pius V accordingly imposed uniformity by law in 1570 with the [[papal bull]] "''Quo primum''", ordering use of the Roman Missal as revised by him.&lt;ref name="QP"/&gt; He allowed only those rites that were at least 200 years old to survive the promulgation of his 1570 Missal. Several of the rites that remained in existence were progressively abandoned, though the [[Ambrosian rite]] survives in [[Milan]], Italy and neighbouring areas, stretching even into Switzerland, and the [[Mozarabic rite]] remains in use to a limited extent in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and [[Madrid]], Spain. The [[Carmelite]], [[Carthusian]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] religious orders kept their rites, but in the second half of the 20th century two of these three chose to adopt the [[Roman Rite]]. The rite of [[Braga]], in northern Portugal, seems to have been practically abandoned: since 18 November 1971 that archdiocese authorizes its use only on an optional basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apostolicos.en.telepolis.com/9-BRAGA_(Portugal).html Braga - Capital de Distrito]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 17th century, France and neighbouring areas, such as [[Münster]], [[Cologne]] and [[Trier]] in Germany, saw a flurry of independent missals published by bishops influenced by [[Jansenism]] and [[Gallicanism]]. This ended when [[Abbot Guéranger]] and others initiated in the 19th century a campaign to return to the Roman Missal.

Pius V's revision of the liturgy had as one of its declared aims the restoration of the Roman Missal "to the original form and rite of the holy Fathers".&lt;ref name="QP" /&gt; Due to the relatively limited resources available to his scholars, this aim was in fact not realised.&lt;ref&gt;"Just after the Council of Trent, the study 'of ancient manuscripts in the Vatican library and elsewhere', as Saint Pius V attests in the Apostolic Constitution ''Quo primum'', helped greatly in the correction of the Roman Missal. Since then, however, other ancient sources have been discovered and published and liturgical formularies of the Eastern Church have been studied. Accordingly, many have had the desire for these doctrinal and spiritual riches not to be stored away in the dark, but to be put into use for the enlightenment of the mind of Christians and for the nurture of their spirit" ([http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0262r.htm Apostolic Constitution ''Missale Romanum''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101124024/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0262r.htm |date=2012-11-01}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Three different printings of Pius V's Roman Missal, with minor variations, appeared in 1570, a folio and a quarto edition in Rome and a folio edition in Venice. A reproduction of what is considered to be the earliest, referred to therefore as the ''editio princeps'', was produced in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|88-209-2547-8}}; publisher: Libreria Editrice Vaticana; introduction and appendix by Manlio Sodi and Achille Maria Triacca&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the printing of the ''editio princeps'', some corrections were made by pasting revised texts over parts of the already printed pages.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the reproduction of the ''editio princeps'', pages XXVI-XXX&lt;/ref&gt; There were several printings again in the following year 1571, with various corrections of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the reproduction of the ''editio princeps'', pages XXI&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical variations==
[[File:Missale Romanum Glagolitice.jpg|thumbnail|[[Missale Romanum Glagolitice|Missale Romanum]] in [[Croatian language|Croatian]] [[Glagolitic script]] printed in 1483]]
In the [[Apostolic Constitution]] ([[papal bull]]) ''[[Quo primum]]'', with which he prescribed use of his 1570 edition of the Roman Missal, Pius V decreed: "We order and enjoin that nothing must be added to Our recently published Missal, nothing omitted from it, nor anything whatsoever be changed within it." This of course did not exclude changes by a Pope, and Pope Pius V himself added to the Missal the feast of [[Our Lady of Victory]], to celebrate the victory of [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Lepanto]] of 7 October 1571. His immediate successor, [[Pope Gregory XIII]], changed the name of this feast to "The Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary" and [[Pope John XXIII]] changed it to "Our Lady of the Rosary".

Pius V's work in severely reducing the number of feasts in the Roman Calendar (see [[Tridentine Calendar#Comparison with other Roman calendars|this comparison]]) was very soon further undone by his successors. Feasts that he had abolished, such as those of the Presentation of Mary, Saint Anne and Saint Anthony of Padua, were restored even before Clement VIII's 1604 typical edition of the Missal was issued.

In the course of the following centuries new feasts were repeatedly added and the [[General Roman Calendar of 1954#Rank of feast days|ranks]] of certain feasts were raised or lowered. A comparison between Pope Pius V's [[Tridentine Calendar]] and the [[General Roman Calendar of 1954]] shows the changes made from 1570 to 1954. Pope Pius XII made a general revision in [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII|1955]], and Pope John XXIII made further general revisions in [[General Roman Calendar of 1960|1960]] simplifying the terminology concerning the ranking of liturgical celebrations.

While keeping on 8 December what he called the feast of "the Conception of Blessed Mary" (omitting the word "Immaculate"), Pius V suppressed the existing special Mass for the feast, directing that the Mass for the Nativity of Mary (with the word "Nativity" replaced by "Conception") be used instead. Part of that earlier Mass was revived in the Mass that [[Pope Pius IX]] ordered to be used on the feast.

===Typical editions of the Roman Missal===
[[File:Santa Cecilia.jpg|thumb|Altar of [[Santa Cecilia in Trastevere]], as arranged in 1700:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://monasticmatrix.usc.edu/figurae/?function=summary&amp;id=483 |title=S.

Retrieved 20 July 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In addition to such occasional changes, the Roman Missal was subjected to general revisions whenever a new "typical edition" (an official edition whose text was to be reproduced in printings by all publishers) was issued.

After Pius V's original Tridentine Roman Missal, the first new typical edition was promulgated in 1604 by [[Pope Clement VIII]], who in 1592 had issued a revised edition of the [[Vulgate]]. The Bible texts in the Missal of Pope Pius V did not correspond exactly to the new Vulgate, and so Clement edited and revised Pope Pius V's Missal, making alterations both in the scriptural texts and in other matters. He abolished some prayers that the 1570 Missal obliged the priest to say on entering the church; shortened the two prayers to be said after the Confiteor; directed that the words "{{lang|la|Haec quotiescumque feceritis, in meam memoriam facietis}}" ("Do this in memory of me") should not be said while displaying the chalice to the people after the consecration, but before doing so; inserted directions at several points of the Canon that the priest was to pronounce the words inaudibly; suppressed the rule that, at High Mass, the priest, even if not a bishop, was to give the final blessing with three signs of the cross; and rewrote the rubrics, introducing, for instance, the ringing of a small bell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://perso.orange.fr/civitas.dei/PapalMass.htm Solemn Papal Mass]. See further [http://perso.orange.fr/civitas.dei/cavendish.htm The Tridentine Mass] by Paul Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt;

The next typical edition was issued in 1634, when [[Pope Urban VIII]] made another general revision of the Roman Missal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/DocumentContents/Index/2/SubIndex/41/DocumentIndex/403 Apostolic Constitution ''Si quid est'']&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no further typical edition until that of [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10354c.htm ''Missal''] in Catholic Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; It introduced only minor changes, not profound enough to merit having the papal bull of its promulgation included in the Missal, as the bulls of 1604 and 1634 were.

In 1911, with the bull ''Divino Afflatu'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius10/p10divino.htm ''Divino afflatu'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Pius X]] made significant changes in the rubrics. He died in 1914, so it fell to his successor [[Pope Benedict XV]] to issue a new typical edition incorporating his changes. This 1920 edition included a new section headed: "Additions and Changes in the Rubrics of the Missal in accordance with the Bull ''Divino afflatu'' and the Subsequent Decrees of the Sacred Congregation of Rites". This additional section was almost as long as the previous section on the "General Rubrics of the Missal", which continued to be printed unchanged.

[[Pope Pius XII]] radically revised the [[Palm Sunday]] and [[Easter Triduum]] liturgy, suppressed many [[vigil]]s and octaves and made other alterations in the calendar (see [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII]]), reforms that were completed in Pope John XXIII's 1960 [[Code of Rubrics]], which were incorporated in the final 1962 typical edition of the Tridentine Missal, replacing both Pius X's "Additions and Changes in the Rubrics of the Missal" and the earlier "General Rubrics of the Missal".

Changes made to the liturgy in 1965 and 1967 in the wake of decisions of the Second Vatican Council were not incorporated in the Roman Missal, but were reflected in the provisional vernacular translations produced when the language of the people began to be used in addition to Latin. This explains the references sometimes seen to "the 1965 Missal".

The [[General Roman Calendar]] was revised partially in [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII|1955]] and [[General Roman Calendar of 1960|1960]] and completely in 1969 in [[Pope Paul VI]]'s ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''[[Mysterii Paschalis]]'', again reducing the number of feasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19690214_mysterii-paschalis_en.html ''Mysterii Paschalis''] and [http://ordorecitandi.com/nav/CalendarComparisonMay2002.doc Ordorecitandi website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407130758/http://www.ordorecitandi.com/nav/CalendarComparisonMay2002.doc |date=2004-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1962 Missal===
The Roman Missal issued by Pope John XXIII in 1962 differed from earlier editions in a number of ways.
* It incorporated the change made by John XXIII in 1962, when he inserted into the [[canon of the Mass]] the name of [[Saint Joseph]], the first change for centuries in the canon of the Mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicdigest.com/articles/faith/saints/2013/06-24/st-joseph--the-mass |title=Richard Breyer, "St. Joseph &amp; the Mass" in ''Catholic Digest'' |access-date=2014-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226061339/http://www.catholicdigest.com/articles/faith/saints/2013/06-24/st-joseph--the-mass |archive-date=2015-02-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It incorporated major changes that Pope Pius XII made in 1955 in the liturgy of [[Palm Sunday]] and the [[Easter Triduum]]. These included:
**Abolition of the ceremonies whereby the blessing of palms on Palm Sunday resembled a Mass, with [[Epistle]], [[Gospel (liturgy)|Gospel]], [[Preface (liturgy)|Preface]] and [[Sanctus]]; suppression of the knocking three times on the closed doors before returning to the church after the blessing and distribution of the palms; omission of the prayers at the foot of the altar and of the Last Gospel.
**On [[Holy Thursday]] the washing of feet was incorporated into the Mass instead of being an independent ceremony; if done by a bishop, 12 men, not 13, had their feet washed; the Mass itself was said in the evening instead of the morning and some of its prayers were removed or altered.
**On [[Good Friday]], elements that suggested the usual practices of the Mass were removed: the sacred ministers began the liturgy in alb and (for celebrant and deacon) black stoles, rather than respectively in black chasuble, dalmatic, and tunicle, as per a typical Mass; the sacred ministers donned their vestments (without maniples) only for the Solemn Intercessions, in which the celebrant wore a cope instead of a chasuble, and removed them for the adoration of the Cross; the sacred ministers changed to violet vestments (again, without maniples) for the distribution of Holy Communion; "Let us pray. Let us kneel. Arise" was added at the prayer for the Jews, and the adjective ''perfidis'' was removed (see [[Good Friday Prayer for the Jews]]); an afternoon Communion Service replaced the morning [[Mass of the Presanctified]], at which the priest alone received the earlier-consecrated [[Host (liturgy)|host]], and drank unconsecrated wine into which a small portion of the consecrated host had been put.
**The [[Easter Vigil]] was moved from [[Holy Saturday]] morning to the following nighttime; the use of a triple candle was abolished and other changes were made both to the initial ceremonies centred on the Paschal Candle and to other parts, such as the reduction from twelve to four of the prophecies read, and the introduction of a "renewal of baptismal promises" for the laity (notable for being the first time since the codification of the Missal of Pope Pius V that the vernacular was permitted to be used in such a manner).
*It incorporated the rubrical changes made by Pope Pius XII's 1955 decree ''Cum nostra'', which included:
**Vigils were abolished except those of Easter, Christmas, Ascension, Pentecost, Saints Peter and Paul, Saint John the Baptist, Saint Lawrence, and the Assumption;
**all [[octave (liturgical)|octaves]] were abolished except those of Easter, Christmas and Pentecost;
**no more than three [[collect]]s were to be said at [[Low Mass]] and one at [[Solemn Mass]].
*Its calendar incorporated both the changes made by Pope Pius XII in 1955 ([[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII]]) and those introduced by Pope John XXIII himself with his 1960 [[Code of Rubrics]] ([[General Roman Calendar of 1960]]). These included:
**suppression of the "Solemnity of Saint Joseph, Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary" (Wednesday after the second Sunday after Easter) and its replacement by the feast of "Saint Joseph the Worker" (1 May);
**removal of some duplicate feasts that appeared twice in earlier versions of the calendar, namely, the [[Feast of the Chair of Saint Peter|Chair of Saint Peter at Rome]] (18 January), the [[Feast of the Cross|Finding of the Holy Cross]] (3 May), [[San Giovanni a Porta Latina|Saint John before the Latin Gate]] (6 May), the Apparition of [[Saint Michael]] (8 May), [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Saint Peter in Chains]] (1 August), and the Invention of the Relics of [[Saint Stephen]] (3 August);
**addition of feasts such as that of the [[Queenship of Mary]] (31 May).
*It replaced the Roman Missal's introductory sections, ''Rubricae generales Missalis'' (General Rubrics of the Missal) and ''Additiones et variationes in rubricis Missalis ad normam Bullae "Divino afflatu" et subsequentium S.R.C. Decretorum'' (Additions and alterations to the Rubrics of the Missal in line with the Bull ''Divino afflatu'' and the subsequent decrees of the Sacred Congregation of Rites), with the text of the General Rubrics and the General Rubrics of the Roman Missal parts of the 1960 Code of Rubrics.

Pope Benedict XVI authorized, under certain conditions, continued use of this 1962 edition of the Roman Missal as an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben-xvi_motu-proprio_20070707_summorum-pontificum_en.html Pope Benedict XVI's ''motu proprio'' ''Summorum Pontificum'']&lt;/ref&gt; alongside the later form, introduced in 1970, which is now the normal or ordinary form.&lt;ref&gt;"The Missal published by Paul VI and then republished in two subsequent editions by John Paul II, obviously is and continues to be the normal Form – the ''Forma ordinaria'' – of the Eucharistic Liturgy" ([http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html Pope Benedict XVI's letter to the bishops on the occasion of the publication of ''Summorum Pontificum'').]&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-1962 forms of the Roman Rite, which some individuals and groups employ,&lt;ref&gt;Their dislike of the 1962 Missal is expressed for instance in a [http://www.traditionalmass.org/articles/article.php?id=18&amp;catname=6 list of differences] prepared by [[Daniel Dolan]].&lt;/ref&gt; are not authorized for liturgical use.

== Liturgical structure ==
The Mass is divided into two parts, the Mass of the Catechumens and the Mass of the Faithful. Catechumens, those being instructed in the faith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Collaborative International Dictionary of English v.0.48 |year = 1913 |url = http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict2&amp;Database=*&amp;Query=catechumen |accessdate = 2008-03-25 |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; were once dismissed after the first half, not having yet professed the faith. Profession of faith was considered essential for participation in the [[Eucharist]]ic sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Chapman |first = John |title = Didache |year = 1908 |url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04779a.htm |accessdate = 2008-03-25 |quote=Let no one eat or drink of the Eucharist with you except those who have been baptized in the name of the Lord. |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This rule of the ''[[Didache]]'' is still in effect. It is only one of the three conditions (baptism, right faith and right living) for admission to receiving Holy Communion that the Catholic Church has always applied and that were already mentioned in the early 2nd century by Saint [[Justin Martyr]]: "And this food is called among us the Eucharist, of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined" (''[[First Apology]]'', Chapter LXVI).

===Before Mass===
* [[Asperges]] (Sprinkling with [[holy water]], [[Psalms|Psalm]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=21&amp;ch=050&amp;l=3%2C+9 51:9, 3]) is an optional [[penance|penitential]] rite that ordinarily precedes only the principal [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] on Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;It is an additional ceremony, not part of the Mass itself, and in the Tridentine Missal is given only in an appendix.&lt;/ref&gt; In the sacristy, a priest wearing an [[alb]], if he is to celebrate the Mass, or [[surplice]], if he is not the celebrant of the Mass, and vested with a [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], which is the color of the day if the priest is the celebrant of the Mass or purple if he is not the celebrant of the Mass, exorcises and blesses salt and water, then puts the blessed salt into the water by thrice sprinkling it in the form of a cross while saying once, "Commixtio salis et aquæ pariter fiat in nomine Patris, et Filii et Spiritus Sancti" (May a mixture of salt and water now be made in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit). After that, the priest, vested in a [[cope]] of the color of the day, while the choir sings an antiphon and a verse of [[Psalms|Psalm]] 50/51 or 117/118, sprinkles with the holy water the altar three times, and then the clergy and the congregation. This rite, if used, precedes the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar. During the [[Easter]] season, the "Asperges me..." verse is replaced by the "Vidi aquam..." verse, and "Alleluia" is added to the "Ostende nobis..." verse and to its response.

Following the Asperges, Mass begins.

===Mass of the Catechumens===
The first part is the Mass of the Catechumens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/Text/Index/4/SubIndex/66/ContentIndex/18/Start/17 Text of Mass of the Catechumens]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prayers at the foot of the altar====
&lt;!-- This section title serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links including the redirect page [[Prayers at the Foot of the Altar]]. Please do not modify it. --&gt;
[[File:Missa tridentina 001.jpg|270px|right|thumb|Prayers at the foot of the altar]]
The sequence of Prayers at the foot of the altar is:
* [[Sign of the cross]]
:The priest, after processing in—at solemn Mass with deacon, and subdeacon, master of ceremonies and servers, and at other Masses with one or more servers—and at Low Mass placing the veiled chalice on the centre of the altar, makes the sign of the cross at the foot of the altar. At Solemn Mass, the chalice is placed beforehand on the [[credence table]].
* Psalm [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=21&amp;ch=042&amp;l=4 42] ({{bibleref2|Psalm|43|NRSVCE}} MT, i.e. Masoretic numbering), known by its incipit ''{{lang|la|Iudica me}}'', is recited, except in Masses of the season during Passiontide and in Requiem Masses. It is preceded and followed by an antiphon of Psalm 42:4 (43:4 MT) "''{{lang|la|Introibo ad altare Dei, ad Deum qui lætificat iuventutem meam}}''" (Translation: "I shall go in to the altar of God, the God who gives joy to my youth"), is recited by the priest, alternating with the deacon and subdeacon (if present) or servers. 
*{{bibleref2|Psalm|124:8|DRA}} is recited:
:{{dialogue|Priest|Our help is in the name of the Lord,|mood1=makes the sign of the cross|Servers|Who made heaven and earth.}}
*The double form of a prayer of general confession of sins, known by its incipit ''[[Confiteor]]'' (I confess), is recited:
:{{dialogue|Priest|''{{lang|la|Confíteor Deo omnipoténti, beátæ Maríæ semper Vírgini, beáto Michaéli Archángelo, beáto Ioanni Baptístæ, sanctis Apóstolis Petro et Paulo, ómnibus Sanctis, et vobis, fratres (tibi, Pater), quia peccávi nimis cogitatióne, verbo et ópere:}} (while striking the breast three times) {{lang|la|mea culpa, mea culpa, mea máxima culpa. Ideo precor beátam Maríam semper Vírginem, beátum Michaélem Archángelum, beátum Ioánnem Baptístam, sanctos Apóstolos Petrum et Paulum, omnes Sanctos, et vos, fratres (te, Pater), oráre pro me ad Dóminum Deum nostrum.}}''|mood1=while bowing low}}
::(Translation: I confess to almighty [[God]], to [[Blessed Virgin Mary|blessed Mary ever Virgin]], to [[Michael (archangel)|blessed Michael the archangel]], to [[John the Baptist|blessed John the Baptist]], to the [[holy]] [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], to all the [[saint]]s, and to you, brethren, that I have [[sin]]ned exceedingly in thought, word, and deed through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault. Therefore, I beseech blessed Mary ever Virgin ... and you, brethren, to [[prayer|pray]] to the [[Jesus|Lord]] our God for me.) 
:The servers pray for the priest: "May Almighty God have mercy on thee, forgive thee thy sins, and bring thee to life everlasting." Then it is the ministers' or servers' turn to confess sinfulness and to ask for prayers. They use the same words as those used by the priest, except that they say "you, Father," in place of "you, brethren", and the priest responds with the same prayer that the servers have used for him (but using the plural number) plus an extra prayer.
* Some verses are then said by priest and ministers (or servers), ending with the priest saying ''{{lang|la|Oremus te Domine}}'' (Let us pray) After this he ascends to the altar, praying silently "Take away from us our iniquities" "that with pure minds we may worthily enter into the holy of holies", a reference to [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=02&amp;ch=026&amp;l=33-34 26:33-34], [[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=006&amp;l=16 6:16], [[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=008&amp;l=6 8:6], [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=14&amp;ch=003&amp;l=8 3:8], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=31&amp;ch=041&amp;l=4 41:4], and others. He places his joined hands on the edge of the altar, so that only the tips of the small fingers touch the front of it, and silently prays that, by the merits of the Saints whose relics are in the altar, God may pardon all his sins. At the words ''{{lang|la|quorum relíquiæ hic sunt}}'' (whose relics are here), he spreads his hands and kisses the altar.

====Priest at the altar====
[[File:Dominus vobiscum 1960s.jpg|thumb|''Dominus vobiscum'' ("The Lord be with you") before the [[Collect]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;In the Tridentine Mass the priest should keep his eyes downcast at this point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/rubrics/ Rubrics V]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]]
* [[Introit]]
** The priest again makes the sign of the Cross while he begins to read the Introit, which is usually taken from a [[Psalm]]. Exceptions occur: e.g. the Introit for [[Easter]] Sunday is adapted from [[Book of Wisdom|Wis]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=25&amp;ch=010&amp;l=20-21 10:20-21], and the antiphon in Masses of the Blessed Virgin Mary was from the poet [[Coelius Sedulius|Sedulius]]. This evolved from the practice of singing a full Psalm, interspersed with the antiphon, during the entrance of the clergy, before the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar were added to the Mass in medieval times. This is indicated by the very name of "Introit".
* [[Kyrie]]
** This part of Mass is a linguistic marker of the origins of the Roman liturgy in [[Greek language|Greek]]. "Kyrie, eleison; Christe, eleison; Kyrie, eleison." means "Lord, have mercy; Christ have mercy;..." Each phrase is said (or sung) three times.
* [[Gloria in excelsis Deo]]
** The first line of the ''Gloria''&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.earthlink.net/~thesaurus/thesaurus/Trinitas/Gloria.html Text in Latin and English]&lt;/ref&gt; is taken from [[Gospel of Luke|Lk]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|2:14}}. The ''Gloria'' is omitted during the penitential liturgical seasons of Advent, Septuagesima, Lent, and Passiontide, in which violet vestments are worn, but is used on feasts falling during such seasons, as well as on Holy Thursday. It is always omitted for a Requiem Mass.
* The [[Collect]]
** The priest turns toward the people and says, "Dominus vobiscum." The servers respond: "Et cum spiritu tuo." ("The Lord be with you." "And with thy spirit"). The Collect follows, a prayer not drawn directly from Scripture. It tends to reflect the season.

====Instruction====
* The priest reads the [[Epistles|Epistle]], primarily an extract from the [[letters of St. Paul]] to various churches. In his ''motu proprio'' ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'', Pope Benedict XVI has permitted this to be read in the vernacular language when Mass is celebrated with the people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/EN/resources/summorum-pontificum.html ''Summorum Pontificum'', article 6]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Between the Epistle and the Gospel two (rarely three) choir responses are sung or said. Usually these are a [[Gradual]] followed by an [[Alleluia]]; but between [[Septuagesima]] Sunday and [[Holy Saturday]], or in a [[Requiem Mass]] or other penitential Mass the Alleluia is replaced by a [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]], and between [[Easter]] Sunday and [[Pentecost]] the Gradual is replaced by a second Alleluia. On a few exceptional occasions (most notably Easter, Pentecost, Corpus Christi, and in a Requiem Mass), a [[Sequence (poetry)|Sequence]] follows the Alleluia or Tract.
** The Gradual is partly composed of a portion of a [[Psalm]].
* The [[Gospel]] reading, an extract from one of the four Gospels
** Before the reading or chanting of the Gospel, the priest prays: "Cleanse my heart and my lips, O almighty God, who didst cleanse the lips of the prophet [[Isaiah|Isaias]]...", a reference to [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=27&amp;ch=006&amp;l=6-7 6:6]. In this passage, after being cleansed by the [[angel]], Isaiah was instructed to prophesy.
* The Homily
** The rite of Mass as revised by Pope Pius V (the Tridentine Mass) does not consider a sermon obligatory and speaks of it instead as merely optional: it presumes that the Creed, if it is to be said, will follow the Gospel immediately, but adds: "If, however, someone is to preach, the Homilist, after the Gospel has been finished, preaches, and when the sermon or moral address has been completed, the Credo is said, or if it is not to be said, the Offertory is sung."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/rubrics/ The Rubrics of the Missale Romanum 1962: VI. The Epistle, the Gradual, and everything else up to the Offertory]&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast the Roman Missal as revised by Pope Paul VI declares that the homily may not be omitted without a grave reason from Mass celebrated with the people attending on Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation and that it is recommended on other days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/GIRM.pdf General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 66]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Credo|Creed]]
** This is the [[Nicene Creed]], professing faith in God the Father, in God the Son, the Word made flesh, in God the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]], and in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Holy Church]]. At the mention of the [[Incarnation]], the celebrant and the congregation genuflect.

===Mass of the Faithful===
The second part is the Mass of the Faithful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/Text/Index/4/SubIndex/66/ContentIndex/19/Start/17 Text of Mass of the Faithful]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Offertory====
* [[Offertory]] Verse
** After greeting the people once more ("''Dominus vobiscum/Et cum spiritu tuo''") and giving the invitation to pray (''Oremus''), the priest enters upon the Mass of the Faithful, from which the non-baptized were once excluded. He reads the Offertory Verse, a short quotation from Holy Scripture which varies with the Mass of each day, with hands joined.
* Offering of Bread and Wine
** The priest offers the host, holding it on the paten at breast level and praying that, although he is unworthy, God may accept "this spotless host (or victim, the basic meaning of ''hostia'' in Latin) for his own innumerable sins, offences and neglects, for all those present, and for all faithful Christians living and dead, that it may avail unto salvation of himself and those mentioned. He then mixes a few drops of water with the wine, which will later become the Blood of Jesus, and holding the chalice so that the lip of the chalice is about the height of his lips, offers "the chalice of salvation", asking that it may "ascend with a sweet fragrance." He then prays a prayer of contrition adapted from [[Book of Daniel|Dan]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=32&amp;ch=003&amp;l=39-40 3:39-40].
* Incensing of the offerings and of the faithful
** At a [[Solemn Mass|High Mass]], the priest blesses the [[incense]], then incenses the bread and wine. Among the prayers the priest says is [[Psalms|Psalm]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=21&amp;ch=140&amp;l=2-4 141:2-4]: "Let my prayer, O Lord, be directed as incense in Thy sight;...", which is prayed as he incenses the altar. The priest then gives the thurible to the deacon, who incenses the priest, then the other ministers and the congregation.
* Washing the hands
** The priest prays [[Psalms|Psalm]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=21&amp;ch=025&amp;l=6-12 26:6-12]: "I will wash my hands among the innocent..."
* Prayer to the Most Holy Trinity
** This prayer asks that the Divine Trinity may receive the oblation being made in remembrance of the passion, resurrection and ascension of Jesus and in honour of blessed Mary ever Virgin and the other saints, "that it may avail to their honour and our salvation: and that they may vouchsafe to intercede for us in [[heaven]]..."
* [[Orate fratres]], [[Suscipiat]] and [[Secret (liturgy)|Secret]]; [[Amen]] concludes Offertory
** Here the priest turns to the congregation and says the first two words, "Orate, fratres," in an elevated tone and then turns around while finishing the exhortation in the secret tone. "Pray, Brethren, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Father almighty."
** The altar servers respond with the [[Suscipiat]] to which the priest secretly responds, "Amen.": ''Suscipiat Dominus sacrificium de manibus tuis, ad laudem et gloriam nominis sui, ad utilitatem quoque nostram, totiusque ecclesiæ suae sanctæ.'' A translation in the English is: "May the Lord accept this sacrifice at your hands, to the praise and glory of His name, for our good and the good of all His Holy Church."
** The Priest then says the day's Secret inaudibly, and concludes it with ''Per omnia sæcula sæculorum'' aloud.
** The altar servers and (in dialogue Mass) the congregation respond: "Amen."

====Consecration====
[[File:Generalvikar Dr. Weis 1.JPG|270px|right|thumb]]
* [[Preface (Liturgy)|Preface]] of the Canon
**"The [[Canon of the Mass|Roman Canon]] dates in essentials from before [[Pope Gregory I|St. Gregory the Great]], who died in 604, and who is credited with adding a phrase to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope St. Gregory I ("the Great")}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[History of the Roman Canon]].) It contains the main elements found in almost all rites, but in an unusual arrangement and it is unclear which part should be considered to be the [[Epiclesis]].
** Dominus vobiscum. ''Et cum spiritu tuo.'' [[Sursum corda]]. ''Habemus ad Dominum.'' Gratias agamus Domino Deo nostro. ''Dignum et iustum est.'' The first part can be seen above at the Collect; the rest means: Lift up your hearts. ''We lift them up to the Lord.'' Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. ''It is right and just.''
**Next a preface is prayed, indicating specific reasons for giving thanks to God. This leads to the [[Sanctus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.earthlink.net/~thesaurus/thesaurus/Trinitas/Sanctus.html Santus]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Canon of the Mass|Canon]] or rule of consecration&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/Text/Index/4/SubIndex/66/ContentIndex/20/Start/17 Mass of the Faithful - The Canon]&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Intercession]] (corresponding to the reading of the diptychs in the Byzantine Rite—a diptych is a two-leaf painting, carving or writing tablet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict2&amp;Database=*&amp;Query=Diptych Diptych]&lt;/ref&gt;)
*** Here the priest prays for the living, that God may guard, unite and govern the Church together with the Pope and "all those who, holding to the truth, hand on the catholic and apostolic faith". Then specific living people are mentioned, and the congregation in the church. Next, Mary ever Virgin, Saint Joseph, the Apostles, and some Popes and other Martyrs are mentioned by name, as well as a generic "and all your Saints", in communion with whom prayer is offered.
** Prayers preparatory to the consecration
*** A prayer that God may graciously accept the offering and "command that we be delivered from eternal damnation and counted among the flock of those you have chosen".
** [[Consecration]] ([[transubstantiation]]) and major elevation[[File:Consecration Elevation Holy Mass.jpg|thumb|Elevation of the [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] during the [[Canon of the Mass]] at a [[Solemn Mass]]]]
*** The passage [[Gospel of Luke|Lk]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=022&amp;l=19-20 22:19-20] is key in this section. In ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20040610214148/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/407803.htm III 78 3] [[Thomas Aquinas]] addresses the interspersed phrase, "the mystery of faith". On this phrase, see ''[[Memorial Acclamation#Mysterium fidei|Mysterium fidei]]''.
** Oblation of the victim to God
***An oblation is an offering;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict2&amp;Database=*&amp;Query=oblation Definition of "oblation"]&lt;/ref&gt; the pure, holy, spotless victim is now offered, with a prayer that God may accept the offering and command his holy angel to carry the offering to God's altar on high, so that those who receive the Body and Blood of Christ "may be filled with every grace and heavenly blessing".
** Remembrance of the Dead
*** The priest now prays for the dead ("those who have gone before us with the sign of faith and rest in the sleep of peace") and asks that they be granted a place of refreshment, light and peace. This is followed by a prayer that we be granted fellowship with the Saints. John the Baptist and fourteen martyrs, seven men and seven women, are mentioned by name.
** End of the Canon and doxology with minor elevation
*** The concluding [[doxology]] is: "Through him, and with him, and in him, O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honour is yours, for ever and ever." "Amen" ratifies the Canon prayer.

====Elevation candle====
[[Image:Messe mit Wandlungskerze Beuron.jpg|thumb|left|[[Beuron Art School]] representation of an elevation candle, mistakenly placed at the Gospel side and upon the altar]]
Until 1960, the Tridentine form of the Roman Missal laid down that a candle should be placed at the Epistle side of the altar and that it should be lit at the showing of the consecrated sacrament to the people.&lt;ref&gt;"Ab eadem parte Epistolae paretur cereus ad elevationem Sacramenti accendendus" (Rubricae generales Missalis, XX)&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, except in monasteries and on special occasions, this had fallen out of use long before Pope John XXIII replaced the section on the general rubrics of the Roman Missal with his [[Code of Rubrics]], which no longer mentioned this custom. On this, see [[Elevation (liturgy)#Elevation candle|Elevation candle]].

====Communion====
[[File:Offertory Offertorium Suscipe Sancte Pater.jpg|thumb|Before receiving Communion from the chalice, the priest makes the sign of the cross over himself, saying (in Latin): May the Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ keep my soul for eternal life. Amen.]]
:::::::::::*The [[Lord's Prayer]] and Libera nos&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/Text/Index/4/SubIndex/66/ContentIndex/21/Start/17 Mass of the Faithful - Closing Prayers]&lt;/ref&gt;
::::::::::::*The "Libera nos" is an extension of the Lord's Prayer developing the line "sed libera nos a malo" ("but deliver us from evil"). The priest prays that we may be delivered from all evils and that the Virgin Mary, Mother of God, together with the apostles and saints, may intercede to obtain for us peace in our day.
:::::::::::*[[Fraction (religion)|Fraction]] of the Host
::::::::::::*During the preceding prayer, the priest breaks the consecrated Host into three parts, and after concluding the prayer drops the smallest part into the Chalice while praying that this commingling and consecration of the Body and Blood of Christ may "be to us who receive it effectual to life everlasting."
:::::::::::* [[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|Agnus Dei]]
::::::::::::* "Agnus Dei" means "[[Lamb of God]]". The priest then prays: "Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world, have mercy on us." He repeats this, and then adds: "Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world, grant us peace." The Mass of the Last Supper on Holy Thursday has "have mercy on us" all three times. In Requiem Masses, the petitions are "grant them rest" (twice), followed by "grant them eternal rest."
* The [[Holy kiss|Pax]]
**The priest asks Christ to look not at the priest's sins but at the faith of Christ's Church, and prays for peace and unity within the Church. Then, if a High Mass is being celebrated, he gives the sign of peace to the deacon, saying: "Peace be with you."
*Prayers preparatory to the Communion
** In the first of these two prayers for himself, the priests asks that by Holy Communion he may be freed from all his iniquities and evils, be made to adhere to the commandments of Jesus and never be separated from him. In the second he asks: "Let not the partaking of Thy Body, O Lord Jesus Christ...turn to my judgment and condemnation: but through Thy goodness may it be unto me a safeguard...."
* Receiving of the Body and Blood of our Lord
** The priest quietly says several prayers here, before receiving Communion. The first is said in a low voice while taking up the Host onto the paten.  The second of them, spoken three times in a slightly audible voice,&lt;ref&gt;In pre-1962 editions of the Roman Missal, only the first four words, "Domine, non sum dignus", were to be said in the slightly audible voice.&lt;/ref&gt; while the priest holds the Host in his left hand and strikes his breast with his right, is based on {{Bibleverse||Matthew|8:8}}: "Lord, I am not worthy...."  Then, after having reverently consumed the Host, he takes up the chalice while in a low voice reciting {{Bibleverse||Psalm|116:12-13}}: "What shall I render to the Lord, for all the things he hath rendered unto me? I will take the chalice of salvation; and I will call upon the name of the Lord." immediately adding {{Bibleverse||Psalm|18:4}}: "Praising I will call upon the Lord: and I shall be saved from my enemies." 
[[File:Padre no Ecce Agnus Dei em Campos.jpg|thumb|right|Priest on the "Ecce Agnus Dei - Behold the Lamb of God" in the people communion.]]
**If the priest is to give Communion to others, he holds up a small host and says aloud: "Behold the Lamb of God ...", and three times: "Lord, I am not worthy ...". He then gives Communion, first making with the host the sign of the cross over each communicant, while saying: "May the Body of Our Lord Jesus Christ preserve your soul for eternal life. Amen."&lt;ref&gt;''Ritus servandus'', X, 6 of the 1962 Missal&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conclusion====
[[File:IteMissaEst.jpg|thumb|310px|"Ite, missa est" sung by the [[deacon]] at a [[Solemn Mass]].]]
* Prayers during the Ablutions
** The prayers now focus on what has been received, that "we may receive with a pure mind", "that no stain of sin may remain in me, whom these pure and holy sacraments have refreshed."
* [[Communion Antiphon]] and [[Postcommunion]]
** The communion antiphon is normally a portion of a Psalm. The Postcommunion Prayer is akin to the Collect in being an appropriate prayer not directly drawn from Scripture.
* [[Ite Missa est]]; Blessing
** "Go, it is the dismissal." The word "Mass" derives from this phrase.
** After saying a silent prayer for himself, the priest then gives the people his blessing.
** Prior to the revisions of Pope Pius XII and Pope John XXIII, the ''Ite Missa est'' was replaced with ''[[Benedicamus Domino]]'' ("Let us bless the Lord") on days in which the ''Gloria'' was not said and the rubrics required the priest to wear violet vestments (i.e., Masses of the season during Advent, Septuagesima, Lent and Passiontide; vigils; certain votive Masses). In the 1962 Missal, ''Benedicamus Domino'' is said only when the Mass is followed by another liturgical action, such as the Eucharistic Processions on Holy Thursday and Corpus Christi.
**  In Requiem Masses, the ''Ite Missa est'' is replaced with ''[[Rest in peace|Requiescant in pace]]'', with the response being "Amen" instead of ''Deo gratias''.
* The [[Last Gospel]]
** The priest then reads the Last Gospel, the beginning of the [[Gospel of John]], {{Bibleverse||John|1:1-14}}, which recounts the Incarnation of the Son of God. On certain occasions, as for instance at the Day Mass on Christmas Day, another Gospel passage was read instead because that Gospel is read as the Gospel of the Mass, but [[Pope John XXIII]]'s revision of the rubrics decreed that on those and on other occasions the Last Gospel should simply be omitted.

=== Prayers of the priest before and after Mass ===

The Tridentine Missal includes prayers for the priest to say before and after Mass.

In later editions of the Roman Missal, including that of 1962, the introductory heading of these prayers indicates that they are to be recited ''pro opportunitate'' (as circumstances allow),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.latin-dictionary.org/Latin-English-Dictionary/Pro_opportunitate |title=Latin Dictionary |access-date=2014-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609074403/http://www.latin-dictionary.org/Latin-English-Dictionary/Pro_opportunitate |archive-date=2015-06-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which in practice means that they are merely optional and may be omitted. The original Tridentine Missal presents most of the prayers as obligatory, indicating as optional only a very long prayer attributed to Saint Ambrose (which later editions divide into seven sections, each to be recited on only one day of the week) and two other prayers attributed to Saint Ambrose and Saint Thomas Aquinas respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Manlio Sodi, Achille Maria Triacca (editors), ''Missale Romanum: Editio Princeps (1570)'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1988 {{ISBN|978-88-209-2547-5}}), pp. 27–36&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these three prayers, the original Tridentine Missal proposes for the priest to recite before he celebrates Mass the whole of Psalms 83–85, 115, 129 (the numbering is that of the [[Septuagint]] and [[Vulgate]]), and a series of [[collect]]-style prayers. Later editions add, after the three that in the original Missal are only optional, prayers to the Blessed Virgin, Saint Joseph, all the angels and saints, and the saint whose Mass is to be celebrated, but, as has been said, treats as optional all the prayers before Mass, even those originally given as obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preces-latinae.org/thesaurus/AnteMissam.html Orationes ante Missam]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Tridentine Missal proposes for recitation by the priest after Mass three prayers, including the ''[[Adoro te devote]]''. Later editions place before these three the Canticle of the Three Youths ([[Book of Daniel|Dan]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=32&amp;ch=3 Douay-Rheims Version]&lt;/ref&gt; with three collects, and follow them with the ''[[Anima Christi]]'' and seven more prayers, treating as optional even the three prescribed in the original Tridentine Missal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preces-latinae.org/thesaurus/PostMissam.html Orationes post Missam]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leonine Prayers===

From 1884 to 1965, the Holy See prescribed the recitation after [[Low Mass]] of certain prayers, originally for the solution of the [[Roman Question]] and, after this problem was solved by the [[Lateran Treaty]], "to permit tranquillity and freedom to profess the faith to be restored to the afflicted people of Russia".&lt;ref&gt;Allocution ''Indictam ante'' of 30 June 1930, in ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 22 (1930), page 301&lt;/ref&gt;

These prayers are known as the [[Leonine Prayers]] because it was [[Pope Leo XIII]] who on 6 January 1884 ordered their recitation throughout the world. In what had been the [[Papal States]], they were already in use since 1859.

The prayers comprised three [[Ave Maria]]s, one [[Salve Regina]] followed by a [[versicle]] and [[response (liturgy)|response]], and a collect prayer that, from 1886 on, asked for the conversion of sinners and "the freedom and exaltation of Holy Mother the Church", and, again from 1886 on, a [[prayer to Saint Michael]]. In 1904, [[Pope Pius X]] added a thrice-repeated "Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on us."

In 1964, with effect from 7 March 1965, the Holy See ended the obligation to recite the Leonine Prayers after Low Mass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adoremus.org/Interoecumenici.html#anchor36482722 Instruction ''Inter Oecumenici'', 48 j]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Leonine Prayers are sometimes still recited after present-day celebrations of Tridentine Mass, although they are not included even in the 1962 edition of the Tridentine Missal.

===Participation by the people===
[[File:Nuptial Mass Missa Nuptialis.jpg|thumb|[[Nuptial Mass|Nuptial Low Mass]]]]
[[File:Dom Rifan distributing Holy Communion.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Distribution of Communion at a Tridentine Mass: typically, the faithful kneel and receive in the mouth and women wear a [[Christian headcovering|headcovering]].]]

The participation of the congregation at the Tridentine Mass is interior, involving eye and heart, and exterior by mouth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Pius X|Pope St. Pius X]] said: "If you wish to hear Mass as it should be heard, you must follow with eye, heart, and mouth all that happens at the altar. Further, you must pray with the Priest the holy words said by him in the Name of Christ and which Christ says by him" (The Daily Missal and Liturgical Manual from the Editio Typica of the Roman Missal and Breviary, 1962, Baronius Press, London, 2004, p. 897).&lt;/ref&gt;

Except in the [[Dialogue Mass]] form, which arose about 1910 and led to a more active exterior participation of the congregation, the people present at the Tridentine Mass do not recite out loud the prayers of the Mass. Only the server or servers join with the priest in reciting the prayers at the foot of the altar (which include the [[Confiteor]]) and in speaking the other responses.&lt;ref&gt;They gave responses to "[[Kyrie eleison]]", "[[Dominus vobiscum]]", "Per omnia saecula saeculorum", the [[Gospel]] reading, the "[[Orate Fratres]]", "[[Sursum Corda]]", "Gratias agamus Domino Deo nostro", the conclusion of the [[Lord's Prayer]], the "Pax Domini sit semper vobiscum" and the "[[Ite Missa est]]"&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the prayers that the priest says are spoken inaudibly, including almost all the Mass of the Faithful: the offertory prayers, the [[Canon of the Mass]] (except for the preface and the final doxology), and (apart from the [[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|Agnus Dei]]) those between the [[Lord's Prayer]] and the [[postcommunion]].

At a [[Solemn Mass]] or [[Missa Cantata]], a choir sings the servers' responses, except for the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar. The choir sings the [[Introit]], the [[Kyrie]], the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]], the [[Gradual]], the [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]] or [[Alleluia]], the [[Credo]], the [[Offertory]] and [[Eucharist|Communion]] [[antiphon]]s, the [[Sanctus]], and the [[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|Agnus Dei]]. Of these, only the five that form part of the [[Ordinary of the Mass]] are usually sung at a Missa Cantata. In addition to the [[Gregorian Chant]] music for these, polyphonic compositions exist, some quite elaborate. The priest largely says quietly the words of the chants and then recites other prayers while the choir continues the chant.

== Different levels of celebration ==
There are various forms of celebration of the Tridentine Mass:
* [[Pontifical High Mass]]: celebrated by a [[bishop]] accompanied by an assisting priest, [[deacon]], [[subdeacon]], [[thurifer]], acolytes and other ministers, under the guidance of a priest acting as Master of Ceremonies. Most often the specific parts assigned to deacon and subdeacon are performed by priests. The parts that are said aloud are all chanted, except that the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar, which before the reform of Pope Pius V were said in the sacristy, are said quietly by the bishop with the deacon and the subdeacon, while the choir sings the Introit. The main difference between a pontifical and an ordinary High Mass is that the bishop remains at his throne almost all the time until the offertory.
* [[Solemn Mass|Solemn or High Mass]] ([[Latin (language)|Latin]]: ''Missa solemnis''): offered by a priest accompanied by a deacon and subdeacon and the other ministers mentioned above.
* [[Missa Cantata]] ([[Latin (language)|Latin]] for "sung mass"): celebrated by a priest without deacon and subdeacon, and thus a form of Low Mass, but with some parts (the three variable prayers, the Scripture readings, Preface, Pater Noster, and Ite Missa Est) sung by the priest, and other parts (Introit, Kyrie, Gloria, Gradual, Tract or Alleluia, Credo, Offertory Antiphon, Sanctus and Benedictus, Agnus Dei, and Communion Antiphon) sung by the choir. Incense may be used exactly as at a Solemn Mass with the exception of incensing the celebrant after the Gospel which is not done.
* [[Low Mass]]: the priest sings no part of the Mass, though in some places a choir or the congregation sings, during the Mass, hymns not always directly related to the Mass.

In its article "The Liturgy of the Mass", the 1917 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' describes how, when [[concelebration]] ceased to be practised in Western Europe, Low Mass became distinguished from [[Solemn Mass|High Mass]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Liturgy of the Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The separate celebrations then involved the building of many altars in one church and the reduction of the ritual to the simplest possible form. The deacon and subdeacon were in this case dispensed with; the celebrant took their part as well as his own. One server took the part of the choir and of all the other ministers, everything was said instead of being sung, the incense and kiss of peace were omitted. So we have the well-known rite of low Mass (''missa privata''). This then reacted on high Mass (''missa solemnis''), so that at high Mass too the celebrant himself recites everything, even though it be sung by the deacon, subdeacon, or choir.

On the origin of the "Missa Cantata", the same source gives the following information:

:... high Mass is the norm; it is only in the complete rite with deacon and subdeacon that the ceremonies can be understood. Thus, the rubrics of the [[Ordinary of the Mass]] always suppose that the Mass is high. Low Mass, said by a priest alone with one server, is a shortened and simplified form of the same thing. Its ritual can be explained only by a reference to high Mass. For instance, the celebrant goes over to the north side of the altar to read the Gospel, because that is the side to which the deacon goes in procession at high Mass; he turns round always by the right, because at high Mass he should not turn his back to the deacon and so on. A sung Mass (missa Cantata) is a modern compromise. It is really a low Mass, since the essence of high Mass is not the music but the deacon and subdeacon. Only in churches which have no ordained person except one priest, and in which high Mass is thus impossible, is it allowed to celebrate the Mass (on Sundays and feasts) with most of the adornment borrowed from high Mass, with singing and (generally) with incense.

== Revision of the Roman Missal ==
[[Pius XII]] began in earnest the work of revising the Roman Missal with a thorough revision of the rites of Holy Week, which, after an experimental period beginning in 1951, was made obligatory in 1955. The Mass that used to be said on Holy Thursday morning was moved to the evening, necessitating a change in the rule that previously had required fasting from midnight. The Good Friday service was moved to the afternoon, Holy Communion was no longer reserved for the priest alone (as before, hosts consecrated at the Holy Thursday Mass were used) and the priest no longer received part of the host in unconsecrated wine. The Easter Vigil service that used to be held in morning of Holy Saturday&lt;ref&gt;Conventual Mass (Mass of a religious community) on a Vigil, such as that of Easter, was celebrated after None, at which point the fast could be broken (see Rubricae generalis Missalis, XV, 2). Though None was in origin an afternoon prayer, it was then celebrated in the morning. Similarly, Lauds, which was originally a morning prayer, was commonly celebrated in choir on the evening before, as in the office of [[Tenebrae]]. "Private Masses" (Masses celebrated by a priest without a congregation) could, even on days of fast, be celebrated at any hour from dawn to noon (see Rubricae generalis Missalis, XV, 1). Most celebrations of the Easter Vigil were in the form of private Masses, since concelebration was not allowed.&lt;/ref&gt; was moved to the night that leads to Easter Sunday and many changes were made to the content.

In 1960, [[Pope John XXIII]] (1958–1963) ordered the suppression of the word "perfidis" ("unbelieving" i.e. not believing in Jesus), applied to the [[Jew]]s, in the rites for Good Friday. He revised the rubrics to the Order of Mass and the Breviary. Two years later, in 1962, he made some more minor modifications on the occasion of publishing a new typical edition of the Roman Missal. This is the edition authorized for use by virtue of the ''Quattuor abhinc annos'' indult (see below, under ''Present status of the Tridentine Mass''). Among the other changes he made and that were included in the 1962 Missal were: adding St. Joseph's name to the Roman Canon; eliminating the second Confiteor before Communion; suppressing 10 feasts, such as St. Peter's Chair in Rome (or, more accurately, combining both feasts of St Peter's Chair into one, as they originally had been); incorporating the abolition of 4 festal octaves and 9 vigils of feasts and other changes made by Pope Pius XII; and modifying rubrics especially for Solemn High Masses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traditionalmass.org/articles/article.php?id=18&amp;catname=6 The Pius X and John XXIII Missals Compared]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the names that disappeared from the Roman Missal was that of St [[Philomena]]: her liturgical celebration had never been admitted to the General Roman Calendar, but from 1920 it had been included (with an indication that the Mass was to be taken entirely from the common) in the section headed "Masses for some places", i.e. only those places for which it had been specially authorized; but her name had already in 1961 been ordered to be removed from all liturgical calendars.

On 4 December 1963, the [[Second Vatican Council]] decreed in Chapter II of its Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy ''[[Sacrosanctum Concilium]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/v2litur.htm Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]he rite of the Mass is to be revised ... the rites are to be simplified, due care being taken to preserve their substance. Parts which with the passage of time came to be duplicated, or were added with little advantage, are to be omitted. Other parts which suffered loss through accidents of history are to be restored to the vigor they had in the days of the holy Fathers, as may seem useful or necessary. The treasures of the Bible are to be opened up more lavishly so that a richer fare may be provided for the faithful at the table of God’s word ... A suitable place may be allotted to the vernacular in Masses which are celebrated with the people ... communion under both kinds may be granted when the bishops think fit...as, for instance, to the newly ordained in the Mass of their sacred ordination, to the newly professed in the Mass of their religious profession, and to the newly baptized in the Mass which follows their baptism..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The instruction ''Inter Oecumenici'' of 26 September 1964 initiated the application to the Mass of the decisions that the Council had taken less than a year before. Permission was given for use, only in Mass celebrated with the people, of the vernacular language, especially in the Biblical readings and the reintroduced Prayers of the Faithful, but, "until the whole of the Ordinary of the Mass has been revised," in the chants (Kyrie, Gloria, Creed, Sanctus, Agnus Dei, and the entrance, offertory and communion antiphons) and in the parts that involved dialogue with the people, and in the Our Father, which the people could now recite entirely together with the priest. Most Episcopal Conferences quickly approved interim vernacular translations, generally different from country to country, and, after having them confirmed by the Holy See, published them in 1965. Other changes included the omission of Psalm 43 (42) at the start of Mass and the Last Gospel at the end, both of which Pope Pius V had first inserted into the Missal (having previously been private prayers said by the priest in the sacristy), and the Leonine Prayers of [[Pope Leo XIII]]. The [[Canon of the Mass]], which continued to be recited silently, was kept in Latin.

Three years later, the instruction ''Tres abhinc annos''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adoremus.org/TresAbhinc.html ''Tres abhinc annos'']&lt;/ref&gt; of 4 May 1967 gave permission for use of the vernacular even in the Canon of the Mass, and allowed it to be said audibly and even, in part, to be chanted; the vernacular could be used even at Mass celebrated without the people being present. Use of the [[maniple (vestment)|maniple]] was made optional, and at three ceremonies at which the [[cope]] was previously the obligatory vestment the [[chasuble]] could be used instead.

[[Pope Paul VI]] continued implementation of the Council's directives, ordering with [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Missale Romanum''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Paul06/p6missal.htm Missale Romanum]&lt;/ref&gt; of Holy Thursday, 3 April 1969, publication of a new official edition of the Roman Missal, which appeared (in Latin) in 1970.

===Opposition to the latest revisions of the liturgy===
Some [[Traditionalist Catholic]]s reject to a greater or lesser extent the changes made since 1950 (see [[Traditionalist Catholic#Rite of Mass|Traditionalist Catholic]]). None advocate returning to the original (1570) form of the liturgy, though some may perhaps wish a re-establishment of its form before Pius X's revision of the rubrics in 1911. Some do refuse to accept the 1955 changes in the liturgy of Palm Sunday and the Easter Triduum and in the liturgical calendar (see [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII]]), and instead use the [[General Roman Calendar as in 1954]]. Others accept the 1955 changes by Pius XII, but not those of Pope John XXIII. Others again, in accordance with the authorization granted by Pope Benedict XVI in ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'', use the Missal and [[General Roman Calendar of 1960|calendar]] as it was in 1962.

Some of them argue that, unlike earlier reforms, the revision of 1969-1970 which replaced the Tridentine Mass with the [[Mass of Paul VI|Mass of Pope Paul VI]] represented a major break with the past. They consider that the content of the revised liturgy is, in Catholic terms, seriously deficient and defective; some hold that it is displeasing to God, and that no Catholic should attend it.&lt;ref&gt;Pope Benedict XVI, who has several times deplored departures on private initiative from the rite of Mass established in the 1970 revision of the Roman Missal has declared this contention unfounded, writing: "There is no contradiction between the two editions of the Roman Missal. In the history of the liturgy there is growth and progress, but no rupture. ... Needless to say, in order to experience full communion, the priests of the communities adhering to the former usage cannot, as a matter of principle, exclude celebrating according to the new books. The total exclusion of the new rite would not in fact be consistent with the recognition of its value and holiness" ([http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html Letter] to the Bishops on the occasion of the publication of the Apostolic Letter ''motu proprio data'' [[Summorum Pontificum]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

When a preliminary text of two of the sections of the revised Missal was published in 1969, Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] gathered a group of twelve theologians, who, under his direction,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sspx.org/SSPX_FAQs/appendix_iii_history_1.htm A Short History of the SSPX] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015194912/http://www.sspx.org/SSPX_FAQs/appendix_iii_history_1.htm |date=2009-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a study of the text. They stated that it "represents, both as a whole and in its details, a striking departure from the Catholic theology of the Mass as it was formulated in Session 22 of the Council of Trent".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1969ottoviani.html Ottaviani letter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116083713/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1969ottoviani.html |date=2009-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal [[Alfredo Ottaviani]], a former Prefect of the Sacred [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], supported this study with a letter of 25 September 1969 to Pope Paul VI. Cardinal [[Antonio Bacci]] signed the same letter. The critical study became known as "[[the Ottaviani Intervention]]".&lt;ref name="OttavianiIntervText"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ottaviani|first1=Alfredo|last2=Bacci|first2=Antonio|last3=Group of Roman Theologians|title=The Ottaviani Intervention: A Critical Study of the New Mass|url=http://www.catholictradition.org/Eucharist/ottaviani.htm|website=Catholic Tradition|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal Ottaviani subsequently stated in writing that he had not intended his letter to be made public, and that Pope Paul VI's doctrinal exposition, on 19 November&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/audiences/1969/documents/hf_p-vi_aud_19691119_it.html Talk on 19 November 1969]&lt;/ref&gt; and 26 November 1969,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/audiences/1969/documents/hf_p-vi_aud_19691126_it.html Talk on 26 November 1969]&lt;/ref&gt; of the revised liturgy in its definitive form meant that "no one can be genuinely scandalised any more".&lt;ref&gt;[http://matt1618.freeyellow.com/novusordo.html#III.%20What%20about%20Cardinal%20Ottaviani’s%20Letter?

In October 1967, a meeting of the Synod of Bishops had already given its opinion on a still earlier draft.

From the 1960s onwards, Western countries have experienced a drop in Mass attendance (in the United States, from 75% of Catholics attending in 1958 to 25% attending by 2002). These same countries saw a decline in seminary enrollments and in the number of priests (in the United States, from 1,575 ordinations in 1954 to 450 in 2002), and a general erosion of belief in the doctrines of the Catholic faith. Opponents of the revision of the Mass liturgy argue, citing opinion poll evidence in their support, that the revision contributed to this decline.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth C. (January 2003). Index of Leading Catholic Indicators: The Church since Vatican II. Oriens Publishing. {{ISBN|0-9728688-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, pointing, among other considerations, to the fact that, globally, there are more priests and seminarians now than in previous years (in 1970, there were 72,991 major seminarians worldwide, in 2002, there were 113,199, an increase of 55%, at a time, however, when there was an increase of global population of 64%),&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[World population]]&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the apparent decline of Catholic practice in the West is due to the general influence of secularism and liberalism on Western societies rather than to developments within the Church.

==Attitudes of Popes since the Second Vatican Council==

===Pope Paul VI===
Following the introduction of the [[Mass of Paul VI]] in 1969-1970, the [[Holy See]] granted a significant number of permissions for the use of the former liturgy. For example, elderly priests were not required to switch to celebrating the new form. In England and Wales, occasional celebrations of the Tridentine Mass were allowed in virtue of what became known as the "[[Agatha Christie indult]]". However, there was no general worldwide legal framework allowing for the celebration of the rite. Following the rise of the [[Traditionalist Catholic]] movement in the 1970s, Pope Paul VI reportedly declined to liberalise its use further on the grounds that it had become a politically charged symbol associated with opposition to his policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Collins| first1 = Roger | title = Keepers of the Keys of Heaven: A History of the Papacy | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2009 | location =  | pages = 488–489| isbn = 978-0-465-01195-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pope John Paul II===
In 1984, the [[Holy See]] sent a letter known as ''[[Quattuor abhinc annos]]'' to the presidents of the world's [[Episcopal Conference]]s. This document empowered diocesan bishops to authorise, on certain conditions, celebrations of the Tridentine Mass for priests and laypeople who requested them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adoremus.org/Quattuorabhincannos.html English translation of ''Quattuor abhinc annos'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, following the excommunication of Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] and four bishops that he had consecrated, the Pope issued a further document, a ''[[motu proprio]]'' known as ''[[Ecclesia Dei]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_02071988_ecclesia-dei_en.html ''Ecclesia Dei'']&lt;/ref&gt; which stated that "respect must everywhere be shown for the feelings of all those who are attached to the Latin liturgical tradition". The Pope urged bishops to give "a wide and generous application" to the provisions of ''Quattuor abhinc annos'', and established the [[Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei|Pontifical Commission ''Ecclesia Dei'']] to oversee relations between Rome and Traditionalist Catholics.

The Holy See itself granted authorisation to use the Tridentine Mass to a significant number of priests and priestly societies, such as the [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter]], the [[Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest]], and the [[Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney]]. Some diocesan bishops, however, declined to authorise celebrations within their dioceses, or did so only to a limited extent. In some cases, the difficulty was that those seeking the permission were hostile to the church authorities. Other refusals of permission were alleged to have stemmed from certain bishops' disapproval in principle of celebrations of the Tridentine liturgy.

===Pope Benedict XVI===
As a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], Joseph Ratzinger was regarded as having a particular interest in the liturgy, and as being favourable towards the older rite of Mass. He famously criticized the erratic way in which, contrary to official policy, many priests celebrated the revised rite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barroux.org/docum/RATZINGER_REF.pdf Preface to the French edition of ''Die Reform der Römischen Liturgie'' by Klaus Gamber]; [https://web.archive.org/web/20040208002309/http://www.latin-mass-society.org/ratzshow.htm partial English translation]; cf. ''The Spirit of the Liturgy'', San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 2000; and ''Looking Again at the Question of the Liturgy with Cardinal Ratzinger: Proceedings of the July 2001 Fontgombault Liturgical Conference,'' Farnborough, Hampshire: St. Michael's Abbey Press, 2002.

In September 2006, the [[Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei|Pontifical Commission ''Ecclesia Dei'']] established the [[Institute of the Good Shepherd]], made up of former members of the [[Society of St. Pius X]], in Bordeaux, France, with permission to use the Tridentine liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Mershon, "New French traditionalist priestly society founded," ''The Wanderer'', September 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This step was met with some discontent from French clergy, and thirty priests wrote an open letter to the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;"French clerics rebel on Latin Mass," ''The Conservative Voice'', October 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Consistently with its previous policy, the Society of St Pius X rejected the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.laportelatine.org/accueil/communic/2006/institutbonpasteur/institut.php |title=Communiqué de la Fraternité Sacerdotale Saint Pie X |access-date=2007-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027124243/http://www.laportelatine.org/accueil/communic/2006/institutbonpasteur/institut.php |archive-date=2007-10-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following repeated rumours that the use of the Tridentine Mass would be liberalised, the Pope issued a ''[[motu proprio]]'' called ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'' on 7 July 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/summorum-pontificum.html Text of the motu proprio ''Summorum Pontificum'' in Latin and English]&lt;/ref&gt; together with an accompanying letter to the world's Bishops.&lt;ref name = "Pope_Letter"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Benedict XVI | authorlink = Pope Benedict XVI | title = Letter of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the Bishops on the occasion of the publication of the Apostolic Letter "motu proprio data" ''Summorum Pontificum'' on the use of the Roman liturgy prior to the reform of 1970 | publisher = Libreria Editrice Vaticana | date = 2007-07-07 | url = http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html | accessdate = 2008-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope declared that "the Roman Missal promulgated by Paul VI is the ordinary expression of the ''lex orandi'' (law of prayer) of the Catholic Church of the Latin rite. Nevertheless, the Roman Missal promulgated by St. Pius V and reissued by St. John XXIII is to be considered as an extraordinary expression of that same 'Lex orandi'".&lt;ref&gt;Article 1 of the motu proprio. In his letter to the Bishops he said: "It is not appropriate to speak of these two versions of the Roman Missal as if they were 'two Rites'. Rather, it is a matter of a twofold use of one and the same rite."&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated that "the 1962 Missal ... was never juridically abrogated".&lt;ref&gt;Similarly, Clement VIII did not juridically abrogate the Missal of Pius V, nor did the other Popes who issued later typical editions of the Roman Missal before that of Paul VI (Urban VIII, Leo XIII, Benedict XV, John XXIII) juridically abrogate the previous editions. Even Pius V juridically abolished only those [[Latin liturgical rites#Defunct local Latin Rites or Uses|variants of the Roman Rite]] that had less than 200 years' antiquity.&lt;/ref&gt; He replaced with new rules those of ''Quattuor Abhinc Annos'' on use of the older form: essentially, authorization for using the 1962 form for parish Masses and those celebrated on public occasions such as a wedding is devolved from the local bishop to the priest in charge of a church, and any priest of the Latin Rite may use the 1962 Roman Missal in "Masses celebrated without the people", a term that does not exclude attendance by other worshippers, lay or clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Indeed, "Mass should not be celebrated without a minister or at least one of the faithful, except for a just and reasonable cause" ([http://www.acbc.catholic.org.au/documents/200707031933.pdf General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 254]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720091216/http://www.acbc.catholic.org.au/documents/200707031933.pdf |date=2008-07-20 }}). Masses celebrated without the people were once called "private Masses", a term that fell out of favour in the mid-twentieth century: the 1960 ''Codex Rubricarum'', which preceded the Second Vatican Council, declared: "The most sacred Sacrifice of the Mass celebrated according to the rites and regulations is an act of public worship offered to God in the name of Christ and the Church. Therefore, the term 'private Mass' should be avoided" ([http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/missale-romanum-1962.pdf Rubricae Generales Missalis Romani], 269). Cf. [http://www.ad2000.com.au/articles/2005/apr2005p18_1918.html Review of ''Mass without a Congregation: A Sign of Unity or Division?'', by Fr Marian Szablewski CR.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726192759/http://www.ad2000.com.au/articles/2005/apr2005p18_1918.html |date=2008-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While requests by groups of Catholics wishing to use the Tridentine liturgy in parish Masses are to be dealt with by the parish priest (or the rector of the church) rather than, as before, by the local bishop, the Pope and Cardinal Darío Castrillón have stated that the bishops' authority is not thereby undermined.&lt;ref&gt;In the letter to bishops by which he accompanied the ''motu proprio'' the Pope told them that the new regulations "do not in any way lessen your own authority and responsibility, either for the liturgy or for the pastoral care of your faithful." Cardinal Castrillón has stated: "The Pope has not changed the Code of Canon Law. The bishop is the moderator of the liturgy in his own diocese. But the Apostolic See is entitled to shape the sacred liturgy of the universal Church. And a bishop must act in harmony with the Apostolic See and must guarantee the rights of every believer, including that of being able to attend the mass of Saint Pius V, as extraordinary form of the rite" ([http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo.asp?id=15045 ''30Days'', June/July 2007] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013848/http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo.asp?id=15045 |date=2007-09-27 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present regulations==
The regulations set out in ''Summorum Pontificum'' provide that:
* In Masses celebrated "[[Sine populo|without the people]]", every Latin Rite priest may use either the 1962 Roman Missal or that of Paul VI except during the [[Easter Triduum]] (when Masses without participation by the people are no longer allowed). Celebrations of Mass in this form (formerly referred to as "private Masses") may, as before, be attended by laypeople who ask to be admitted.&lt;ref&gt;Article 4 of the ''motu proprio''&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[parish]] Masses, where there is a stable group of laypeople who adhere to the earlier liturgical tradition, the parish priest should willingly accept their requests to be allowed to celebrate the Mass according to the 1962 Missal, and should ensure that their welfare harmonises with the ordinary pastoral care of the parish, under the guidance of the bishop in accordance with canon 392 of the [[Code of Canon Law]], avoiding discord and favouring the unity of the Church.
**Mass may be celebrated using the 1962 Missal on working days, while on Sundays and feast days one such celebration may be held.
**For priests and laypeople who request it, the parish priest should allow celebrations of the 1962 form on special occasions such as weddings, funerals, and pilgrimages.
*Communities belonging to [[religious order|institutes of consecrated life]] and [[society of apostolic life|societies of apostolic life]] which wish to use the 1962 Missal for conventual or "community" celebration in their oratories may do so.

With letter 13/2007 of 20 January 2010 the Pontifical Council Ecclesia Dei responded positively to a question whether a parish priest (pastor) or another priest may on his own initiative publicly celebrate the extraordinary form, along with the customary regular use of the new form, "so that the faithful, both young and old, can familiarize themselves with the old rites and benefit from their perceptible beauty and transcendence". Although the Council accompanied this response with the observation that a stable group of the faithful attached to the older form has a right to assist at Mass in the extraordinary form, a website that published the response interpreted it as not requiring the existence of such a stable group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newliturgicalmovement.org/2010/02/important-clarifications-from-ecclesia.html New Liturgical Movement: Important Clarifications]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present practice==
The publication of ''Summorum Pontificum'' has led to an increase in the number of regularly scheduled public Tridentine Masses. On 14 June 2008 Cardinal [[Darío Castrillón Hoyos]] told a London press conference that Pope Benedict wants every parish to offer both the old and the new forms for Sunday Mass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4159522.ece "Pope says old-rite Latin Mass should be on offer in every Catholic parish"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cardinal said that the Vatican was preparing to instruct seminaries to teach all students the Tridentine form of the Roman Rite. The complexity of the rubrics makes it difficult for priests accustomed to the simpler modern form to celebrate the Tridentine form properly, and it is unclear how many have the required knowledge.

Some [[Traditionalist Catholic]] priests and organisations, holding that no official permission is required to use any form of the Tridentine Mass, celebrate it without regularizing their situation,&lt;ref&gt;Article 5 §4 of the ''motu proprio'' says priests who use the Missal of Blessed John XXIII must not be juridically impeded.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes using editions of the Roman Missal earlier than the 1962 edition approved in ''Summorum Pontificum''.

In order to provide for priests who celebrate the Tridentine Mass, publishers have issued facsimiles or reprintings of old missals. There were two new printings of the 1962 Tridentine Missal in 2004: one, with the imprimatur of [[Bishop]] [[Fabian Bruskewitz]] of [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], by [[Baronius Press]] in association with the [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter]]; the other by the [[Society of St. Pius X]]'s publishing house, [[Angelus Press]]. There was a new printing of a facsimile 1962 Tridentine Altar Missal in 2008 by PCP books. Some other missals reproduced date from before 1955 and so do not have the revised Holy Week rites promulgated by Pope Pius XII. They are used by traditionalists who reject Pius XII's liturgical changes. As well as such altar missals for use by the priest, old hand missals for those attending Mass have been reproduced, including a St Bonaventure Press facsimile of a pre-1955 edition of the St Andrew's Missal.

'''Universal Eclectic Wicca''' (UEW) is one of a number of distinctly American [[Wicca]]n traditions which developed following the introduction of [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian]] and [[Alexandrian Wicca]] to the United States in the early 1960s. Its corporate body is the [[Wiccan church|Church]] of Universal Eclectic Wicca (CUEW) which is incorporated and based in [[Great Falls, Virginia]].

It is particularly noted for its early [[Internet]] teaching [[coven]]&amp;nbsp;– the Coven of the Far Flung Net (CFFN),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Cowan, Douglas E | authorlink=Douglas E. Cowan | title=Cyberhenge: Modern pagans on the internet | publisher=Routledge | location=London &amp; New York | year=2005 | pages=106–107 | isbn=978-0-415-96910-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for its inclusive approach to [[Wicca#Covens and solitary Wiccans|solitary]] as well as coven based practitioners.

==History==

===Silver Chalice Wicca===
What was to become UEW began, in 1969, as the core coven associated with the Silver Chalice Land Trust; an [[intentional community]]  based in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Kestra  | title=CUEW - Church Of Universal Eclectic Wicca | publisher=Witchvox Tradition Profile (Archived at web.archive.org). | url=http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usva&amp;c=trads&amp;id=10267  | date=2006-01-26 | accessdate=2008-10-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060207090106/http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usva&amp;c=trads&amp;id=10267 |archivedate = 2006-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=333a&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5LdM2xfKl64C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Wicca+333:+Advanced+Topics+in+Wiccan+Belief&amp;client=firefox-a#v=snippet&amp;q=head%20of%20the%20church&amp;f=false|chapter=Topic One: The Wiccan Rede: An Adult View|last=MacMorgan|first=Kaatryn A.|title=Wicca333:Advanced Topics in Wiccan Belief|publisher=iUniverse|year=2004|location=Lincoln, NE|page=6|isbn=0-595-27170-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver Chalice had a diverse membership&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Wyrmstar, Tamryn  | title=Silver Chalice Ancestry | publisher=Tamryn's Abode  http://www.angelfire.com/rant/ingwitch/sca.html  | url=http://www.angelfire.com/rant/ingwitch/sca.html | accessdate=2008-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing from both [[Dianic Wicca|Dianic]] and [[British Traditional Wicca|British Traditional]] Wiccan backgrounds. It was partly as a response to this diversity, as well as a perceived need for reform in Wicca, that their High Priestess, [[Jayne Tomas]], began to create a body of liturgy for Silver Chalice Wicca as a distinct tradition.&lt;ref name="Molnar, Melissa"&gt;{{cite web | author=Molnar, Melissa  | title=Universal Eclectic Wicca Tradition | publisher=Mystic Forest of Protection (Archived at web.archive.org) |url=http://groups.msn.com/MysticForestofProtection/universaleclecticwiccatradition.msnw  | date=2008-01-12 | accessdate=2008-10-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080112075057/http://groups.msn.com/MysticForestofProtection/universaleclecticwiccatradition.msnw |archivedate = 2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=MacMorgan-Douglas, Kaatryn | title=All One Wicca: A study in the universal eclectic tradition of wicca. | publisher=Covenstead Press| location=Buffalo, NY| year=2007| pages=131–134 | edition=Tenth Anniversary | isbn=978-0-615-15094-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A defining text is the ''Ordains of Silver Chalice'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Silver Chalice Wicca | title = The Ordains of Silver Chalice | publisher = Tamryn's Abode  (Archived at web.archive.org) | url=http://www.angelfire.com/rant/ingwitch/ord.html  |date = ?1969  | accessdate = 2008-11-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010905155736/http://www.angelfire.com/rant/ingwitch/ord.html |archivedate = 2001-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may be seen as an attempt to refer to, and move away from, the [[Wiccan Laws|''Old Laws'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Noble-Beyer, Catherine | publisher = Wicca: For the Rest of Us | title = The Old Laws or the Ardanes by Gerald Gardner, attributed to the New Forest Coven, 1957 | url = http://wicca.timerift.net/laws/old_laws.shtml | accessdate = 2008-11-02 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081020024011/http://wicca.timerift.net/laws/old_laws.shtml | archive-date = 2008-10-20 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Gardnerian Wicca]].  Together with the ''Fifteen Creeds of Silver Chalice Wicca'' (1969)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Silver Chalice Wicca | title = Fifteen Creeds of Silver Chalice | publisher = Tamryn's Abode  (Archived at web.archive.org) | url=http://www.angelfire.com/rant/ingwitch/15c.html  |year = 1969  | accessdate = 2008-11-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010908230838/http://www.angelfire.com/rant/ingwitch/15c.html |archivedate = 2001-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; they emphasized modernism; democratic principles; historical, intellectual and personal integrity; race and gender equality; self-determination; and engagement with society.

===Change of name===
By 1986 the land held by the Silver Chalice Land Trust was sold, and all the covens that originated with Silver Chalice were referred to as Universal Eclectic Wicca.

'Universal' because "Wicca is universal because it can be used by all, and anything can be used in Wicca"; and 'Eclectic' because "UEW is based not on one or two sources, but an infinite number of sources".&lt;ref name="Molnar, Melissa"/&gt;

===On-line teaching covens===
In 1997 UEW chartered the Coven of the Far Flung Net (CFFN),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuew.org/cffn/index.html|title=Coven of the Far Flung Net|publisher=CUEW|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began operating in January of the following year; and which it maintains was the first on-line teaching coven. UEW has two other on-line teaching groups, the Coven of Non-Fluffy Wicca (2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nonfluffy.com/coven.html|author=Kestra|title=The Non Fluffy Coven for the "rest of us."|publisher=Coven of Non Fluffy Wicca|year=2006|accessdate=2008-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211112951/http://www.nonfluffy.com/coven.html|archive-date=2008-02-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is aimed at more advanced students with some prior knowledge of Wicca, and Vircle, for Third Circle Studies.

===Schisms===
In 2004, following a reorganization of CFFN which abolished its then clan structure, one of the dissolved clans, [http://www.athamesedge.com/ Athames's Edge],  re-established itself to form an independent [[Progressive Eclectic Wicca]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.athamesedge.com/index.php?pg=4 | title=About Us | author=Athame's Edge Learning Coven | accessdate=2008-10-17 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223133654/http://athamesedge.com/index.php?pg=4 | archive-date=2008-12-23 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in 2008, the first Australian UEW coven, [[Circle of Oak and Mistletoe|Oak and Mistletoe]], split away to establish the [[Inclusive Wicca Tradition|Inclusive Wicca]] tradition.

==Core beliefs==
UEW allows for diverse interpretations of Wiccan practice and belief; provided that a core set of ethical values are observed. These are commonly referred to as the ''Five Points of Wiccan Belief'' and the ''Affirmation of Acknowledgement''.

===Five Points===
The Five Points of Wiccan belief are the [[Wiccan Rede]], the [[Rule of Three (Wiccan)|Law of Return]], the Ethic of Self-Responsibility, the Ethic of Constant Improvement and the Ethic of Attunement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuew.org/thefivepoints.html|title=The Five Points of Wiccan Belief|publisher=CUEW|accessdate=2008-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affirmation of Acknowledgement===
In addition to the 'Five Points', UEW requires its members to assent to the ''Affirmation of Acknowledgement'', which is intended to inform behavior towards, and interaction with,  those of other faiths.  It states that:{{Quote|I: I acknowledge the presence of other faiths on my planet, indeed, right here in my city/town/village. I acknowledge that the followers of these faiths feel as strongly, maybe more so, than I do about mine.

II: I forgive the other faiths and wipe clean the slate between us. I cannot hold a person responsible for the acts of their faith, I cannot hold a faith at fault for individual practitioners. It is not my place to convert, or otherwise alter a person's religion. I invite discussion of beliefs without judgment of those holding them.

III: I acknowledge that I may be wrong, and I have found comfort in the fact that I may be right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/rant/ingwitch/aa.html|author= Windsinger, Kat|title=The Affirmation of Acknowledgement|publisher=Tamryn's Abode|accessdate=2008-05-11|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20011202055116/http://www.angelfire.com/rant/ingwitch/aa.html|archivedate= 2001-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/affi_ack.htm|author=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|title=Treating believers of other religions: The Affirmation of Acknowledgment |publisher=ReligiousTolerance.org|location=Ontario|accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Organization==

===Types of membership===

There are five types of membership recognized in UEW:{{Quote|''Pre-First Circle'' - those who have only basic knowledge of UEW or Wicca and who will be typically registered for an introductory course in UEW

* ''First Circle'' - in which a knowledge of The Five Points of Wiccan Belief must be demonstrated;
* ''Second Circle'' - in which a higher degree of knowledge and signing of the oath of practice are required;
* ''Third Circle'' - in which an independent project has determined a "higher level" of Devotion to a "Path" of UEW; and
* ''Clergy'' - ordained ministers.}}

===Triad===
The executive body of CUEW is the three-person Triad.  The Triad is solely responsible for extending or withholding membership of CUEW to both individuals and groups.  Each member of the Triad is responsible for the selection and training of their successor.

===Council of Elders===
The Triad is advised and assisted by a Council of Elders.  Any Third Circle member may nominate themselves for membership of the Council of Elders.  The Council of Elders annually elects one of their number as Chief Elder.

===Association of Universal Eclectic Wicca Clergy===
The Association of Universal Eclectic Wicca Clergy (AUEWC), is responsible for the ratification of Ordained Clergy. CUEW covens with eight or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuew.org/bylaws.html|title=By-laws of the Church of Universal Eclectic Wicca|author=CUEW|accessdate=2008-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4046">'''Victor Weisz''' (25 April 1913 in Berlin, Germany - 22 February 1966 in London, England) was a Hungarian-British [[political cartoonist]], drawing under the name of '''Vicky'''.

== Biography ==

[[File:INF3-54 Admiral of the Fleet Lord Chatfield Artist Vicky.jpg|thumb|Weisz's caricature of [[Ernle Chatfield, 1st Baron Chatfield]]]]
Weisz was born in Berlin, Germany, to Hungarian-Jewish parents.&lt;ref&gt;Concise [[Dictionary of National Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the [[Berlin University of the Arts|Berlin School of Art]] and by 1928, at the age of fifteen, he was working as a freelancer, drawing caricatures.  His father committed suicide that same year and Weisz began work with the journal ''12 Uhr Blatt''.  His work also appeared in other German newspapers.

Weisz's cartoons took a very strong anti-[[Nazism|Nazi]] stance.  When the Nazis came to power in Germany, they took over the journal where Weisz worked.  As a member of the Jewish community with expressed socialist opinions, Weisz decided to leave Germany.
 	
In 1935, he came to the United Kingdom, and worked for the ''[[News Chronicle]]'', ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and ''[[Evening Standard]]''.  He maintained an independent stance, whatever the political hue of his employers ([[Liberal Party (United Kingdom)|Liberal]], [[Labour Party (United Kingdom)|Labour]] and [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative]] respectively), and built a reputation as an incisive commentator on political events.

At the ''Daily Mirror'', Weisz published the ''Nazi Nugget'' series.  By the 1940s, Weisz, using the pseudonym "Vicky", was one of the leading British left-wing cartoonists.  Weisz worked alongside fellow left-wing cartoonist [[Philip Zec]] at the ''Mirror'' and replaced him as the paper's chief political cartoonist in 1954.

In the 1950s boom years, many observers felt that the Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]]'s demeanour as an Edwardian aristocrat was out of step with the times. "Vicky", as the lead political cartoonist of the ''News Chronicle'', ridiculed him as '[[Supermac (cartoon)|Supermac]]', a spoof on the American comic-strip hero [[Superman]].  Contrary to the cartoonist's intention, the title Supermac benefited Macmillan, who went on to increase his parliamentary majority at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 General Election]]. Earlier in the 1950s Vicky had produced some memorable cartoons of Macmillan's predecessor, [[Sir Anthony Eden]], which made effective use of the [[Anthony Eden hat|Homburg hat]] that had been Eden's "trademark" in the 1930s.

Victor Weisz followed his father in suffering from [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[insomnia]]; he committed suicide at his London home on 22 February 1966.
