'''Absolute pitch''' (AP), widely referred to as '''''perfect pitch''''', is a rare auditory phenomenon characterized by the ability of a person to identify or re-create a given [[musical note]] without the benefit of a reference tone.&lt;ref name="phil-494"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Absolute pitch In D.

AP can be demonstrated via linguistic labeling ("naming" a note), auditory imagery,{{clarify|reason=This is puzzling. How does the auditory imagery get out of the person's brain?|date=October 2016}} or sensorimotor responses. For example, an AP possessor can accurately reproduce a heard tone on a musical instrument without "hunting" for the correct pitch.&lt;ref name="Zatorre, 1989"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Zatorre |year=1989 |title=Multiple coding strategies in the retention of musical tones by possessors of absolute pitch|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume= 17 |issue=5 |pages=582–589 |doi=10.3758/BF03197081 |last2=Beckett |first2=Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zatorre, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Zatorre |date=July 2003 |title=Absolute pitch: a model for understanding the influence of genes and development on neural and cognitive function |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=692–695 |doi=10.1038/nn1085 |pmid=12830161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers estimate the occurrence of AP to be 1 in 10,000 people.&lt;ref name="Sacks1995"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oliver Sacks |date=May 1995 |title=Letters: Musical Ability |journal=Science |volume=268 |issue=5211 |pages=621–622 |doi=10.1126/science.7732360 |pmid=7732360|bibcode=1995Sci...268..621S |last2=Schlaug |last3=Jancke |last4=Huang |last5=Steinmetz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, absolute pitch implies some or all of the following abilities, achieved without a reference tone:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Parncutt, R. |author2=Levitin, D. J. |year=2001 |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |chapter=Absolute Pitch |editor=Sadie, S. |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |isbn=1-56159-239-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identify by name individual [[pitch (music)|pitches]] (e.g. F{{music|sharp}}, A, G, C) played on various instruments.
* Name the [[key (music)|key]] of a given piece of tonal music.
* Reproduce a piece of tonal music in the correct key days after hearing it.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
* Identify and name all the tones of a given [[chord (music)|chord]] or other tonal mass.
* Accurately sing a named pitch.
* Name the pitches of common everyday sounds such as [[vehicle horn|car horns]] and [[Alarm device|alarms]].
* Name the frequency of a pitch (e.g. that G{{music|#}}4  is 415Hz) after hearing it.

People may have absolute pitch along with the ability of [[relative pitch]], and relative and absolute pitch work together in actual musical listening and practice, but strategies in using each skill vary.&lt;ref name="Miyazaki, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ken'ichi |last=Miyazaki |date=June 2004 |title=How well do we understand absolute pitch? |journal=Acoustical Science and Technology |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=270–282 |doi=10.1250/ast.25.426 |url=http://psyche.ge.niigata-u.ac.jp/Psyche/Miyazaki/Papers/Miyazaki2004.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816070421/http://psyche.ge.niigata-u.ac.jp/Psyche/Miyazaki/Papers/Miyazaki2004.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with absolute pitch may train their relative pitch and there has been a reported case of 6 adults in China (with previous musical training) acquiring absolute pitch through specific tonal training.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/03/355933&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, two studies by Harvard and the University of Chicago have shown Valproate, a medication used to treat epilepsy and severe depression, may re-open the "critical period" of learning making the acquisition of absolute pitch, as well as languages, potentially as efficient for adults as for children.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.uchicago.edu/story/acquiring-perfect-pitch-may-be-possible-some-adults&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://news.uchicago.edu/story/acquiring-perfect-pitch-may-be-possible-some-adults&lt;/ref&gt; Adults who possess relative pitch but do not already have absolute pitch can also learn "pseudo-absolute pitch" and become able to identify notes in a way that superficially resembles absolute pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Levitin, D.J. |year=2008 |title=Music Meets Medicine, Proceedings of the Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation |chapter=Absolute pitch: Both a curse and a blessing |editor1=Clockars, M. |editor2=Peltomaa, M. |pages=124–132 |publisher=Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation |location=Helsinki, Finland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, training absolute pitch can require considerable motivation, time, and effort, and learning is not retained without constant practice and reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meyer, M |title=On memorizing absolute pitch |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume=28 |year=1956 |pages=718–719 |doi=10.1121/1.1908465 |issue=4|bibcode = 1956ASAJ...28..718M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific studies==

===History of study and terminologies===
Scientific study of absolute pitch appears to have commenced in the 19th century, focusing on the phenomenon of musical pitch and methods of measuring it.&lt;ref name=Ellis1876&gt;{{Cite journal |date=November 6, 1876 |author=Ellis, Alexander J |title=On the Sensitiveness of the Ear to Pitch and Change of Pitch in Music |journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association |pages=1 |series=(published until 1945 as Proceedings of the Musical Association)|volume=3 |issue=1 |doi=10.1093/jrma/3.1.1 |url=http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/ellis76.pdf |accessdate=24 August 2010 |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have been difficult for any notion of absolute pitch to have formed earlier because pitch references were not consistent. For example, the note now known as 'A' varied in different local or national musical traditions between what would now be considered as G sharp and B flat before the standardisation of the late 19th century. While the term ''absolute pitch'', or ''absolute ear'', was in use by the late 19th century by both British&lt;ref name=Bosanquet1876&gt;{{Cite journal |year=1876 |author=Bosanquet, R.H.M |title=An Elementary Treaties on Musical Intervals and Temperament |series=with an Account of an Enharmonic Harmonium Exhibited in the Loan Collection of Scientific Instruments |place=London |publisher=Macmillan and Co |page=xiv (n17 in electronic page field) |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924022233088#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate=24 August 2010 |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German researchers,&lt;ref name=vonKries&gt;{{Cite journal |year=1892 |author=von Kries, J |title=Über das absolute Gehör (About the perfect pitch) |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift für Psychologie |volume=3 |pages=257–79 |url=http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/kreis92.htm |accessdate=24 August 2010 |postscript=}} [http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/kreis92e.htm Translation by Christopher Aruffo, www.acousticlearning.com]&lt;/ref&gt; its application was not universal; other terms such as ''musical ear'',&lt;ref name=Ellis1876/&gt; ''absolute tone consciousness'',&lt;ref name=Otto07&gt;{{Cite journal |year=1907 |author=Abraham, O |title=Das absolute Tonbewußtsein und die Musik (Absolute tone consciousness and music) |language=German |journal=Sammelbände der Internationalen Musikgesellschaft |volume=8 |pages=486–91 |url=http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/abraham07.htm |accessdate=25 August 2010 |postscript=}} [http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/abraham07e.htm Translation by Christopher Aruffo, www.acousticlearning.com]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''positive pitch''&lt;ref name="Copp 1916"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Copp, E.F. |year=1916 |title=Musical Ability |journal=Journal of Heredity |volume=7 |pages=297–305 |url=http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/fletcher/copp.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also used to refer to the ability. The skill is not exclusively musical, or limited to human perception; absolute pitch has been demonstrated in animals such as bats, wolves, gerbils, and birds, for whom specific pitches facilitate identification of mates or meals.&lt;ref name=Brown1999&gt;{{Cite journal |date=4 December 1999 |author=Brown, Kathryn |title=Striking the Right Note |journal=[[New Scientist]] |volume= 164 |issue=2215 |pages=38–41 |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difference in cognition, not elementary sensation===
Physically and functionally, the auditory system of an absolute listener does not appear to be different from that of a non-absolute listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sergeant, D. |title=Experimental investigation of absolute pitch |journal=Journal of Research in Music Education |volume=17 |year=1969 |pages=135–143 |doi=10.2307/3344200 |issue=1 |publisher=Journal of Research in Music Education, Vol. 17, No. 1 |jstor=3344200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, "it reflects a particular ability to analyze frequency information, presumably involving high-level cortical processing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gregersen, P. K. |title=Instant Recognition: The Genetics of Pitch Perception |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics | volume=62 |year=1998 |pages=221–223 |doi=10.1086/301734 |pmid=9463341 |issue=2 |pmc=1376907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absolute pitch is an act of cognition, needing memory of the frequency, a label for the frequency (such as "B-flat"), and exposure to the range of sound encompassed by that categorical label. Absolute pitch may be directly analogous to recognizing [[color]]s, [[phoneme]]s (speech sounds), or other categorical perception of sensory stimuli. Just as most people have learned to recognize and name the color ''blue'' by the range of frequencies of the electromagnetic radiation that are perceived as [[light]], it is possible that those who have been exposed to musical notes together with their names early in life will be more likely to identify, for example, the note C.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Takeuchi, A. H. |author2=Hulse, S. H. |title=Absolute pitch |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=113 |year=1993 |pages=345–361 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.113.2.345 |pmid=8451339 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absolute pitch may also be related to certain genes, possibly an [[autosomal]] [[dominant gene]]tic trait,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Profita, J. |author2=Bidder, T. G. |title=Perfect pitch |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=29 |year=1988 |pages=763–771 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320290405 |pmid=3400722 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baharloo, S. |author2=Johnston, P.

===Influence by music experience===
Absolute pitch sense appears to be influenced by cultural exposure to music, especially in the familiarization of the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered]] [[musical scale|C-major scale]]. Most of the absolute listeners that were tested in this respect identified the C-major tones more reliably and, except for B, more quickly than the five "black key" tones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miyazaki, K. |title=The speed of musical pitch identification by absolute-pitch possessors |journal=Music Perception |volume=8 |year=1990 |pages=177–188 |doi=10.2307/40285495}}&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to the higher prevalence of these tones in ordinary musical experience. One study of Dutch non-musicians also demonstrated a bias toward using C-major tones in ordinary speech, especially on syllables related to emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Braun, M. |title=Absolute pitch in emphasized speech |journal=Acoustics Research Letters Online |volume=3 |year=2002 |pages=77–82 |doi=10.1121/1.1472336 |issue=2| url=http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=ARLOFJ000003000002000077000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;prog=normal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistics===
Absolute pitch is more common among speakers of [[tonal language]]s, such as most dialects of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], which often depend on pitch variation as the means of distinguishing words that otherwise sound the same—e.g., [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] with four possible tonal variations, [[Cantonese]] with six, [[Southern Min]] with seven or eight (depending on dialect), and Vietnamese with six.&lt;ref name=jasa138th&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = D. | last2 = Henthorn | first2 = T. | last3 = Dolson | first3 = M. | title = Tone Language Speakers Possess Absolute Pitch | url = | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |year=1999 | volume = 106 | issue = | page = 2267 |laysummary=http://www.acoustics.org/press/138th/deutsch.htm|laysource=Acoustics.org | doi=10.1121/1.427738|bibcode = 1999ASAJ..106.2267D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jasa148th&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = D. | last2 = Henthorn | first2 = T. | last3 = Marvin | first3 = E. | last4 = Xu | first4 = H. | title = Perfect Pitch in Tone Language Speakers Carries Over to Music | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |year= 2005 | volume = 116 | issue = | page = 2580 |laysource=AIP|laysummary=http://www.aip.org/148th/deutsch.html | doi = 10.1121/1.4808626 |bibcode = 2004ASAJ..116.2580D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] have been reported to speak a word in the same absolute pitch (within a quarter-tone) on different days; it has therefore been suggested that absolute pitch may be acquired by infants when they learn to speak a tonal language&lt;ref name="deu-2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deutsch, D. |author2=Henthorn T. |author3=Dolson, M. |title=Absolute pitch, speech, and tone language: Some experiments and a proposed framework |journal=Music Perception |volume=21 |pages=339–356 |year=2004 |doi=10.1525/mp.2004.21.3.339 |issue=3|url=http://philomel.com/pdf/MP-2004-21_339-356.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and possibly also by infants when they learn to speak a [[Pitch accent|pitch-accent language]]). However, the brains of tonal-language speakers do not naturally process musical sound as language;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gandour, J |author2=Wong, D. |author3=Hutchins, G. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Pitch processing in the human brain is influenced by language experience |journal=NeuroReport |volume=9 |year=1998 |pages=2115–2119 |doi=10.1097/00001756-199806220-00038 |pmid=9674604 |issue=9 |url=http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~gandour/publications/neurp_98.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912000200/http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~gandour/publications/neurp_98.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps such speakers are more likely to acquire absolute pitch for musical tones when they later receive musical training. Many native speakers of a tone language, even those with little musical training, are observed to sing a given song consistently with regard to pitch. Among music students of East Asian ethnic heritage, those who speak a tone language very fluently have a much higher prevalence of absolute pitch than those who do not speak a tone language.&lt;ref name="phil-jasa-2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Deutsch, D. |author2=Henthorn, T. |author3=Marvin, E. |author4=Xu H-S |last-author-amp=yes|title=Absolute pitch among American and Chinese conservatory students: Prevalence differences, and evidence for a speech-related critical period |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=119 |pages=719–722 |year=2006 |doi=10.1121/1.2151799 |pmid=16521731 |issue=2|bibcode = 2006ASAJ..119..719D | url=http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA-2006_119_719-722.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deu-2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deutsch, D. |author2=Dooley, K. |author3=Henthorn, T. |author4=Head, B. |title=Absolute pitch among students in an American music conservatory: Association with tone language fluency |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=125 |pages=2398–2403 |year=2009 |doi=10.1121/1.3081389 |pmid=19354413 |issue=4|bibcode = 2009ASAJ..125.2398D | url=http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA-2009_125_2398-2403.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-588"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deutsch, D. |author2=Li, X. |author3=Shen, J. |last-author-amp=yes | title=Absolute pitch among students at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music: A large-scale direct-test study | journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume=134 | pages=3853–3859 | year=2013 | doi=10.1121/1.4824450 |url=http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA_2013_134_3853-3859.pdf|format=PDF |bibcode = 2013ASAJ..134.3853D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that African level-tone languages—such as [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Connell, B. |author2=Ladd, D. R. |title=Aspects of pitch realization in Yoruba |journal=Phonology |volume=7 |year=1990 |pages=1–29 |doi=10.1017/S095267570000110X}}&lt;/ref&gt; with three pitch levels, and [[Mambila language|Mambila]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Connell, B. |title=The perception of lexical tone in Mambila |journal=Language and Speech |volume=43 |year=2000 |pages=163–182 |doi=10.1177/00238309000430020201 |pmid= 11064955 |issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with four—may be better suited to study the role of absolute pitch in speech than the pitch and contour tone languages of East Asia.

Speakers of European languages have been found to make subconscious use of an absolute pitch memory when speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Braun, M. |title=Speech mirrors norm-tones: Absolute pitch as a normal but precognitive trait |journal=Acoustical Society of America: Acoustics Research Letters Online |volume=2 |year=2001 |pages=85–90 |doi=10.1121/1.1376728 |issue=3 |url=http://ojps.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=ARLOFJ000002000003000085000001&amp;idtype=cvips |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perception===

This phenomenon is apparently unrelated to musical training. The skill may be associated more closely with vocal production. Violin students learning the [[Suzuki method]] are required to memorize each composition in a fixed key and play it from memory on their instrument, but they are not required to sing. When tested, these students did not succeed in singing the memorized Suzuki songs in the original, fixed key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Saah, Victoria |author2=Marvin, Elizabeth West |year=2004 |title=Absolute memory of learned melodies in children trained by the Suzuki violin method |journal=Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition |pages=736–739 |url=http://www.icmpc8.umn.edu/proceedings/ICMPC8/PDF/AUTHOR/MP040009.PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810004816/http://www.icmpc8.umn.edu/proceedings/ICMPC8/PDF/AUTHOR/MP040009.PDF |archivedate=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible problems===
Musicians with absolute perception may experience difficulties which do not exist for other musicians. Because absolute listeners are capable of recognizing that a musical composition has been transposed from its original key, or that a pitch is being produced at a nonstandard frequency (either sharp or flat), a musician with absolute pitch may become distressed upon perceiving tones believed to be "wrong" or hearing a piece of music "in the wrong key." This can especially apply to Baroque music that is recorded in Baroque tuning (usually A = 415&amp;nbsp;Hz as opposed to 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, ''i.e.'', roughly a half step or semitone lower than standard concert pitch).&lt;ref name="Sacks, O. 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sacks, O. |year=2007 |title=Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |isbn=1-4000-4081-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An absolute listener may also use absolute strategies for tasks which are more efficiently accomplished with [[relative pitch|relative strategies]], such as transposition&lt;ref name="miy_1993"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miyazaki, K. |title=Absolute pitch as an inability: Identification of musical intervals in a tonal context |journal=Music Perception |volume=11 |year=1993 |pages=55–72 |doi=10.2307/40285599|jstor=40285599}}&lt;/ref&gt; or producing harmony for tones whose frequencies do not match standard [[equal temperament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harris, G. B. |year=1974 |title=Categorical perception and absolute pitch |publisher=University of Western Ontario |location=Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible for some musicians to have displaced absolute pitch, where all notes are slightly flat or slightly sharp of their respective pitch as defined by a given convention.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} This may arise from learning the pitch names from an instrument that was tuned to a concert pitch convention other than the one in use, ''e.g.'', A = 435&amp;nbsp;Hz (the [[Paris Opera]] convention of the late 19th and early 20th centuries) as opposed to the Anglo-American modern standard A = 440&amp;nbsp;Hz. When playing in groups with other musicians, this may lead to playing in a tonality that is slightly different from that of the rest of the group.

===Synesthesia===
Absolute pitch shows a genetic overlap with [[synesthesia]]/[[ideasthesia]],&lt;ref name=gregersen_2013/&gt;{{clarify|reason=This contradicts with earlier statements in the article, which imply that the genetic status of perfect pitch is not verified. Which is it?|date=October 2016}} and some individuals with music-related synesthesia also have perfect pitch.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} They may associate certain notes or keys with different colors, enabling them to tell what any note or key is. It is unknown how many people with perfect pitch are also synesthetes.

==Correlation with musical talent==
Absolute pitch is not a prerequisite for skilled musical performance or composition. However, musicians with absolute pitch tend to perform better on musical transcription tasks (controlling for age of onset and amount of musical training) compared with those without absolute pitch.&lt;ref name="phil-446"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dooley, K. |author2=Deutsch, D. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Absolute pitch correlates with high performance on musical dictation | journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume= 128 | issue=2| pages= 890–3| year=2010 | pmid=20707458 | doi=10.1121/1.3458848 |bibcode = 2010ASAJ..128..890D}} [http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA-2010_128_890-893.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that musicians with absolute pitch perform worse than those without absolute pitch on recognition of musical intervals.&lt;ref name="miyazaki"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Miyazaki K. | title=Perception of relative pitch with different references: Some absolute-pitch listeners can't tell musical interval names | journal=Perception and Psychophysics | volume=57 | issue=7 | pages= 962–970 | year=1995 | doi=10.3758/bf03205455| pmid=8532499}} [http://www.springerlink.com/content/d11h926866110564/fulltext.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; However, experiments on which this conclusion was based contained an artifact{{Clarify|reason=How defined and of what kind? A physical object designed to stimulate memory or generate a frame of reference? An intervening note serving as a confounding factor that people with absolute pitch might conceivably "latch onto" in ways that people without it would not?|date=April 2016}}, and when this artifact was removed, absolute pitch possessors were found to perform better than nonpossessors on recognition of musical intervals.&lt;ref name="phil-473"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dooley, K. |author2=Deutsch, D. | title=Absolute pitch correlates with high performance on interval naming tasks | journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume=130 | issue=6 |pages=4097–4104 | year=2011 | doi=10.1121/1.3652861 | pmid=22225064 | bibcode=2011ASAJ..130.4097D}} [http://philomel.com/pdf/JAS004097.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to uncertainty in the historical record, it is often impossible to determine whether notable composers and musicians of the past had absolute pitch. Since absolute pitch is rare in European musical culture,&lt;ref name="deu_2006b"/&gt; claims that any particular musician possessed it are difficult to evaluate. Among composers of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical music era|Classical]] eras, evidence is available only for [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], who is documented to have demonstrated the ability at age 7.&lt;ref name="phil-45"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1121/1.2961141 | author=Deutsch, D. | title=The Enigma of Absolute Pitch | journal=Acoustics Today | volume=2 | pages=11–18 | year=2006 | issue=4}} [http://philomel.com/pdf/AT-2006_2_2.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; Experts have only surmised that [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] had it, as indicated from some excerpts from his letters. By the 19th century, it became more common for the presence of absolute pitch to be recorded, identifying the ability to be present in musicians such as [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[John Philip Sousa]].&lt;ref&gt; Naxos. (2018). "John Philip Sousa." Retrieved from https://www.naxos.com/person/John_Philip_Sousa_24864/24864.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relative pitch==
{{Main article|Relative pitch}}
Many musicians have quite good [[relative pitch]], a skill that can be learned through [[ear training]]. With practice, it is possible to listen to a single known pitch once (from a [[pitch pipe]] or a [[tuning fork]]) and then have stable, reliable pitch identification by comparing the notes heard to the stored memory of the tonic pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brady, P. T. |title=Fixed-scale mechanism of absolute pitch |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=48 |year=1970 |pages=883–887 |doi=10.1121/1.1912227 |pmid=5480385 |issue=4|bibcode = 1970ASAJ...48..883B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike absolute pitch, this skill is dependent on a recently perceived [[tonal center]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3712">'''The [[Adanson]] system''' published by French [[botanist]] [[Michel Adanson]] as the ''Familles des plantes'' in two volumes in 1763{{sfn|Adanson|1763}} was an important step in [[botanical nomenclature]] by establishing the ordering of [[genera]] into [[Family (biology)|families]]. 

Michel Adanson listed 58 families, divided by [[Section (botany)|sections]], for the 1615 genera known to him. He gave these both French and Latin names. The system was completed by [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu]] in 1789. 

==Plant families==
Adanson's listing (Pages 1-7 of Part II) of [[Family (biology)|families]] is as follows (with page numbers of families together with sections and genera in parentheses).&lt;br&gt;Note spelling varies throughout text. The detailed descriptions of families are separately paginated, and shown here in ''italics'', after the Latin names. Some families shown with sections (note not all sections were named, some were just described).

An '''automated dispensing cabinet''' ('''ADC''') is a computerized drug storage device or cabinet designed for hospitals. ADCs allow medications to be stored and dispensed near the [[point of care]] while controlling and tracking drug distribution. They also are called unit-based cabinets (UBCs), automated dispensing devices (ADDs), automated distribution cabinets or automated dispensing machines (ADMs).&lt;ref name=ISMP&gt;{{cite report |title=Guidance on the Interdisciplinary Safe Use of Automated Dispensing Cabinets |publisher=Institute for Safe Medication Practices |date=2008 |url=https://www.ismp.org/Tools/guidelines/ADC_Guidelines_Final.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}}

==Overview==
Hospital pharmacies have traditionally provided medications for patients by filling patient-specific cassettes of unit-dose medications that were then delivered to the nursing unit and stored in medication cabinets or carts. ADCs, which are designed to replace non-automated floor stock storage, were introduced in hospitals in the 1980s and have facilitated the transition to alternative delivery models and more decentralized medication distribution systems.&lt;ref name=ISMP /&gt;

While no one method for medication distribution works for every facility, implementing automated dispensing cabinets as part of a decentralized or hybrid medication distribution system can improve patient safety and the accountability of the inventory, streamline certain billing processes, and ultimately, lead to increased nursing and patient satisfaction.&lt;ref name=PPPmag&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.pppmag.com/documents/V3N6/BuyersGuideP24.pdf |format=PDF |title=Special PP&amp;P Buyer's Guide: Automated Dispensing Cabinets |magazine=Pharmacy Purchasing &amp; Products Magazine |date=September 2006 |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=2,4 |publisher=Ridgewood Medical Media LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because automated dispensing cabinets track user access and dispensed medications, their use can improve control over medication inventory. The real-time inventory reports generated by many cabinets can simplify the fill process and help pharmacy track expired drugs. Furthermore, by restricting individual drugs – such as high-risk medications and controlled substances – to unique drawers within the cabinet, overall inventory management, patient safety, and medication security can be improved. Automated dispensing cabinets allow the pharmacy department to profile physician orders before they are dispensed.&lt;ref name=PPPmag /&gt;

Automated cabinets can also enable providers to record medication charges upon dispensing, reducing the billing paperwork pharmacy is responsible for. In addition, nurses can note returned medications using the cabinets' computers, enabling direct credits to patients' accounts. Since automated cabinets can be located on the nursing unit floor, nursing have speedier access to a patient's medications. Decreased wait time for medication can lead to less frustration for nursing staff and prevent conflict between the pharmacy and nursing staff. Also, shorter waiting time ensures improved patient comfort and care.&lt;ref name= PPPmag /&gt;

==Role of automated dispensing in healthcare==
Automated dispensing is a pharmacy practice in which a device dispenses medications and fills prescriptions. Automated dispensing cabinets, which can potentially handle hundreds of different medications are available from a number of manufacturers. Though members of the pharmacy community have been utilizing automation technology since the 1980s, companies are constantly refining and improving ADCs to meet changing needs and health standards in the industry.

Several goals can be met by implementing an automated solution in a healthcare facility. The most important thing a hospital pharmacy should enforce is [[patient safety]]. Wrong drug and wrong dose errors are the most common errors associated with ADC use. Look-alike drug names and drug packages are common variables that lead to selection errors. For example, [[morphine]] and [[hydromorphone]] are two different [[opioid analgesic]]s that frequently get confused.&lt;ref name=ISMP /&gt;

==Key features==
ADCs are more than [[automated teller machines]] for drugs and reflect how design advances as well as, specific technologies, such as [[barcode]] scanning and clinical decision support, can improve medication safety. Over the years, ADCs have been adapted to facilitate compliance with emerging regulatory requirements such as pharmacy review of medication orders and safe practice recommendations.&lt;ref name=Medscape&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/705681 |url-access=registration |title=Automated Dispensing Cabinets: Getting It Right in the Age of Automation |publisher=Medscape |date=10 July 2009 |journal=Topics in Advanced Practice Nursing eJournal |volume=9 |issue=3 |first=Barbara L. |last=Olson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automated dispensing cabinets incorporate sophisticated software and electronic interfaces to synthesize high-risk steps in the medication use process.&lt;ref name=Medscape /&gt;  These unit-based medication repositories provide computer controlled storage, dispensation, tracking, and documentation of medication distribution on the resident care unit. Since automated dispensing cabinets are not located in the pharmacy, they are considered "decentralized" medication distribution systems. Instead, they can be found at the point of care on the resident care unit. Tracking of the stocking and distribution process can occur by interfacing the unit with a central pharmacy computer. These cabinets can also be interfaced with other external databases such as resident profiles, the facility's admission/discharge/transfer system, and billing systems.&lt;ref name=tech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techforltc.org/producttype.aspx?id=2702,2511 |title=Automated Medication Dispensing Cabinets |website=Technology for Long-Term Care |date=25 May 2010 |access-date=3 June 2010 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113163357/http://www.techforltc.org/producttype.aspx?id=2702%2C2511 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ADCs are designed to meet the exact needs of the nurses and pharmacists that use them. When ADCs are purchased for a facility, the order is customized for whatever the cabinet will be specifically used for.

The drawers are available in a variety of configurations including locked, matrix, and sensing.

In Europe, '''biosystems engineering''' is a field of engineering which integrates engineering science and design with applied biological and environmental sciences. It represents an evolution of engineering disciplines applied to all living organisms not including biomedical applications. Therefore, biosystems engineering is 'the branch of engineering that applies engineering sciences to solve problems involving biological systems' (according to Erabee Network).

In the US, biosystems engineering (see also [[biological systems engineering]]) is a field of engineering which integrates engineering science and design with applied biological, environmental and agricultural sciences.  It represents an evolution of the agricultural engineering discipline applied to all living organisms (but generally not including biomedical applications, which is the realm of biomedical engineering).

In many institutions in the US, biosystems engineering is synonymous with [[biological engineering]].  In some institutions, biosystems engineering is considered a broader term which includes [[agricultural engineering]] and biological engineering also agricultural and biosystems engineering.

Typical programmatic areas include: production of [[bioenergy]]; development of [[biosensors]]; environmental and [[ecological engineering]]; [[controlled-environment agriculture]]; food processing and [[food safety]]; [[agricultural engineering]] (machinery, irrigation, storage), [[water quality]], water quantity, and water recycle (including measurements of pathogens, chemicals, and other contaminants).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20957">{{short description|The maximum population size of the species that the environment can sustain indefinitely}}
{{Ecological economics|Concepts}}
The '''carrying capacity''' of a biological [[species]] in an [[natural environment|environment]] is the maximum population size of the species that the environment can sustain indefinitely, given the food, [[habitat]], [[drinking water|water]], and other [[Resource|necessities available]] in the environment. 
In [[population biology]], carrying capacity is defined as the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]'s maximal load,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hui | first1 = C | year = 2006 | title = Carrying capacity, population equilibrium, and environment's maximal load | url = | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 192 | issue = | pages = 317–320 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2005.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is different from the [[concept]] of population equilibrium. Its effect on [[population dynamics]] may be approximated in a [[logistic function|logistic model]], although this simplification ignores the possibility of [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot]] which real systems may exhibit.

Carrying capacity was originally used to determine the number of animals that could graze on a segment of land without destroying it.  Later, the idea was expanded to more complex populations, like humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carrying Capacity|url=http://www.sustainablescale.org/ConceptualFramework/UnderstandingScale/MeasuringScale/CarryingCapacity.aspx|website=The Sustainable Scale Project|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[human population]], more complex variables such as [[sanitation]] and [[Health care|medical care]] are sometimes considered as part of the necessary establishment. As population density increases, [[birth rate]] often increases and [[death rate]] typically decreases. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate is the "natural increase". The carrying capacity could support a positive natural increase or could require a negative natural increase. Thus, the carrying capacity is the number of individuals an environment can support without significant negative impacts to the given organism and its environment. Below carrying capacity, populations typically increase, while above, they typically decrease. A factor that keeps population size at equilibrium is known as a [[regulating factor]]. [[Population decline|Population size decreases]] above carrying capacity due to a range of factors depending on the [[species]] concerned, but can include insufficient [[space]], [[Food security|food supply]], or [[sunlight]]. The carrying capacity of an [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] may vary for different species and may change over time due to a variety of factors including: [[Food security|food availability]], [[water supply]], environmental conditions and living space.
The origins of the term "carrying capacity" are uncertain, with researchers variously stating that it was used "in the context of international [[shipping]]"&lt;ref name="informaworld.com"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sayre |first1=N. F. |year=2008 |title=The Genesis, History, and Limits of Carrying Capacity |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=98 |issue= |pages=120–134 |publisher= |doi= 10.1080/00045600701734356|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a791001773&amp;db=all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or that it was first used during 19th-century laboratory experiments with micro-organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerer, K.S., [http://dusk.geo.orst.edu/prosem/PDFs/human_geog.pdf "Human Geography and the "New Ecology": The Prospect of Promise and Integration"], ''Annals of the Assoc. of American Geo.'', '''84'''(1), 108–125, (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; A recent review finds the first use of the term in an 1845 report by the [[US Secretary of State]] to the [[US Senate]].&lt;ref name="informaworld.com"/&gt;

{{main|Human overpopulation}}
Several estimates of the carrying capacity have been made with a wide range of population numbers. A 2001 UN report said that two-thirds of the estimates fall in the range of 4 billion to 16 billion with unspecified standard errors, with a median of about 10 billion.&lt;ref name="UN World Population Report 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpm/wpm2001.pdf|format=PDF|title=UN World Population Report 2001|page=31|accessdate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent estimates are much lower, particularly if [[resource depletion|non-renewable resource depletion]] and [[Overconsumption|increased consumption]] are considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in habitat quality or human behavior at any time might increase or reduce carrying capacity. In the view of [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul and Anne Ehrlich]], "for earth as a whole (including those parts of it we call Australia and the United States), human beings are far above carrying capacity today."&lt;ref name=Nineveh-Book/&gt;

The application of the concept of carrying capacity for the [[human population]] has been criticized for not successfully capturing the multi-layered processes between humans and the environment, which have a nature of fluidity and [[non-equilibrium]], and for sometimes being employed in a [[Victim blaming|blame-the-victim]] framework.&lt;ref name=Cliggett&gt;Cliggett, L., "Carrying Capacity's New Guise: Folk Models for Public Debate and Longitudinal Study of Environmental Change", ''[[Africa Today]]'', '''48'''(1), 2-19, (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Although the quote may be good the author doesn't reference anything when making it [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-80493292/carrying-capacity-new-guise.html 1]--&gt;  

Supporters of the concept argue that the idea of a limited carrying capacity is just as valid applied to humans as when applied to any other species. Animal population size, living standards, and resource depletion vary, but the concept of carrying capacity still applies. The number of people is not the only factor in the carrying capacity of Earth. [[Waste]] and [[over-consumption]], especially by wealthy and near-wealthy people and nations, are also putting significant strain on the environment together with [[human overpopulation]]. Population and consumption together appear to be at the core of many human problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/consumption_dwarfs_population_as_main_environmental_threat/2140/|title=Consumption Dwarfs Population as Main Environmental Threat|date=2009-04-13|publisher=Yale University|author=Fred Pearce|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nineveh-Book&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these issues have been studied by computer simulation models such as [[World3]]. When scientists talk of global change today, they are usually referring to human-caused changes in the environment of sufficient magnitude eventually to ''reduce'' the carrying capacity of much of Earth (as opposed to local or regional areas) to support organisms, especially ''Homo sapiens.''&lt;ref name=Dominant-Animal-Book&gt;{{citation

===Factors that govern carrying capacity===
Some aspects of a system's carrying capacity may involve matters such as available supplies of [[food supply|food]], [[water supply|water]], raw materials, and/or other similar resources. In addition, there are other factors that govern carrying capacity which may be less instinctive or less intuitive in nature, such as ever-increasing and/or ever-accumulating levels of [[waste]]s, [[environmental damage|damage]], and/or eradication of essential components of any complex functioning system.  Eradication of, for example, large or critical portions of any [[complex system]] (envision a space vehicle, for instance, or an airplane, or an automobile, or computer code, or the body components of a living vertebrate) can interrupt essential processes and dynamics in ways that induce systems failures or unexpected collapse. (As an example of these latter factors, the "carrying capacity" of a complex system such an airplane is more than a matter of available food, or water, or available seating, but also reflects total weight carried and presumes that its passengers do not damage, destroy, or eradicate parts, [[Door|doors]], windows, wings, engine parts, fuel, and oil, and so forth.) Thus, on a global scale, food and similar resources may affect planetary carrying capacity to some extent so long as Earth's human passengers do not dismantle, eradicate, or otherwise destroy critical [[biosphere|biospheric]] life-support capacities for essential processes of self-maintenance, [[self-perpetuation]], and [[self-repair mechanisms|self-repair]].

Thus, carrying capacity interpretations that focus solely on resource limitations alone (such as food) may neglect wider functional factors.  If the humans neither gain nor lose weight in the long-term, the calculation is fairly accurate. If the quantity of food is invariably equal to the "Y" amount, carrying capacity has been reached. Humans, with the need to enhance their reproductive success (see Richard Dawkins' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''{{Verify source|date=May 2009}}&lt;!-- the gene-centric model of evolution is disputed, in particular in sentient species. Contrast with the Expanded Phenotype, also by Dawkins --&gt;), understand that food supply can vary and also that other factors in the environment can alter humans' need for food. A house, for example, might mean that one does not need to eat as much to stay warm as one otherwise would. Over time, monetary transactions have replaced barter and local production, and consequently modified local human carrying capacity. However, purchases also impact regions thousands of miles away. For example, [[carbon dioxide]] from an [[automobile]] travels to the upper atmosphere. This led [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] to develop the [[I&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;PAT]] equation.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, P.R., Holdren, J.P., "Impact of Population Growth", [[Science (journal)|''Science'']], '''171'''(3977), 1212–1217, (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

: {{math|1=''I'' = ''P'' ∙ ''A'' ∙ ''T''}}
where:
: ''I'' is the impact on the environment resulting from consumption
: ''P'' is the population number
: ''A'' is the consumption per capita (affluence)
: ''T'' is the technology factor
[[File:Logistic curve examples.png|thumb|This is a graph of the population due to the logistic curve model.  When the population is above the carrying capacity it decreases, and when it is below the carrying capacity it increases.]]
An important model related to carrying capacity (K), is the logistic, growth curve. The logistic growth curve depicts a more realistic version of how population growth rate, available resources, and the carrying capacity are inter-connected. As illustrated in the logistic growth curve model, when the population size is small and there are many resources available, population over-time increases and so does the growth rate. However, as population size nears the carrying capacity and resources become limited, the growth rate decreases and population starts to level out at K. This model is based on the assumption that carrying capacity does not change. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that carrying capacity of a population can increase or decrease and there are various factors that affect it. For instance, an increase in the population growth can lead to over-exploitation of necessary natural resources and therefore decrease the overall carrying capacity of that environment.&lt;ref&gt;Swafford, Angela Lynn.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology can play a role in the dynamics of carrying capacity and while this can sometimes be positive,&lt;ref&gt;Martire, S., Castellani, V., &amp; Sala, S. (2015). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.11.002 Carrying capacity assessment of forest resources: Enhancing environmental sustainability in energy production at local scale] Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 94, 11-20. doi: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.11.002]&lt;/ref&gt; in other cases its influence can be problematic. For example, it has been suggested that in the past that the [[Neolithic]] revolution increased the carrying capacity of the world relative to humans through the invention of agriculture.  In a similar way, viewed from the perspective of foods, the use of [[fossil fuel]]s has been alleged to artificially increase the carrying capacity of the world by the use of stored sunlight, even though that food production does not guarantee the capacity of the Earth's climatic and [[Biosphere|biospheric]] life-support systems to withstand the damage and wastes arising from such fossil fuels.  However, such interpretations presume the continued and uninterrupted functioning of all other critical components of the global system.  It has also been suggested that other technological advances that have increased the carrying capacity of the world relative to humans are: [[polder]]s, [[fertilizer]], [[composting]], [[greenhouse]]s, [[land reclamation]], and [[fish farming]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} In an adverse way, however, many technologies enable economic entities and individual humans to inflict far more damage and eradication, far more quickly and efficiently on a wider-scale than ever. Examples include machine guns, chainsaws, earth-movers, and the capacity of industrialized fishing fleets to capture and harvest targeted fish species faster than the fish themselves can reproduce are examples of such problematic outcomes of technology.

[[Agricultural capability]] on Earth expanded in the last quarter of the 20th century. But now there are many projections of a continuation of the decline in world agricultural capability (and hence carrying capacity) which began in the 1990s. Most conspicuously, China's food production is forecast to decline by 37% by the last half of the 21st century, placing a strain on the entire carrying capacity of the world, as China's population could expand to about 1.5 billion people by the year 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Economy, E., ''China vs. Earth'', The Nation, May 7, 2007 issue&lt;/ref&gt; This reduction in China's agricultural capability (as in other world regions) is largely due to the world [[water crisis]] and especially due to mining [[groundwater]] beyond sustainable yield, which has been happening in China since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, R., ''The Little Green Handbook'', [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]], (2006) {{ISBN|978-0-312-42581-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lester Brown]] of the [[Earth Policy Institute]], has said: "It would take 1.5 Earths to sustain our present level of consumption. Environmentally, the world is in an [[overshoot (population)|overshoot]] mode."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological footprint===
One way to estimate human [[demand]] compared to ecosystem's carrying capacity is "[[ecological footprint]]" accounting. Rather than speculating about future possibilities and limitations imposed by carrying capacity constraints, Ecological Footprint accounting provides empirical, non-speculative assessments of the past. It compares historic regeneration rates, [[biocapacity]], against historical human [[demand]], [[ecological footprint]], in the same year.&lt;ref name="WS"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wackernagel | first1 = M. | last2 = Schulz | first2 = N.B. | display-authors = etal |year=2002 |title="Tracking the ecological overshoot of the human economy |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/99/14/9266.short |journal=[[PNAS|Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA]] | volume = 99 | issue = 14| pages = 9266–9271 | doi=10.1073/pnas.142033699 | pmid=12089326 | pmc=123129| bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.9266W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rees, W.E. and Wackernagel, M., ''Ecological Footprints and Appropriated Carrying Capacity: Measuring the Natural Capital Requirements of the Human Economy'', Jansson, A., Folke, C., Hammer, M. and Costanza R. (ed.), [[Island Press]], (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; One result shows that humanity's demand footprint in 1999 exceeded the planet's bio-capacity by &gt;20%.&lt;ref name="WS" /&gt; However, this measurement does not take into account the depletion of the actual fossil fuels, "which would result in a carbon Footprint many hundreds of times higher than the current calculation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/frequently_asked_technical_questions/|title=FAQ - Global Footprint Network|author=|date=|website=footprintnetwork.org|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also concern of the ability of countries around to globe to decrease and maintain their ecological footprints. Holden and Linnerud, scholars working to provide a better framework that adequately judge sustainability development and maintenance in policy making, have generated a diagram that measures the global position of different countries around the world, which shows a linear relation between GDP PPP and ecological foot print in 2007. Possible answers to the question of where we are as individual countries attempting to reach sustainability and development methods to reduce ecological foot print. According to the Figure 1 diagram, the United States had the largest ecological foot print per capita along with Norway, Sweden, and Austria, in comparison to Cuba, Bangladesh, and Korea. &lt;ref name="The Sustainable Development Area"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holden|first1=Erling|last2=Linnerud|first2=Kristin|title=The sustainable development area: satisfying basic needs and safeguarding ecological sustainability|journal=Sustainable Development|date=May 2007|volume=15|issue=3|pages=174–187|doi=10.1002/sd.313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cell biology, the '''Celada-Seiden model''' is a logical description at the inter-[[cell (biology)|cell]]ular level of the mechanisms making up the [[Adaptation|adaptive]] immune [[humoral]] and cellular response to a genetic [[antigen]].

The computational counterpart of the Celada-Seiden model is the [[IMMSIM]] code.

There was a succession of '''Soviet secret police agencies''' over time. The first [[secret police]] after the [[October Revolution]], created by [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s decree on December 20, 1917, was called "[[Cheka]]" (ЧК). Officers were referred to as "chekists", a name that is still informally applied to people under the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Federal Security Service]] of [[Russia]], the [[KGB]]'s successor in Russia after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

For most agencies listed here secret policing operations were only part of their function; for instance, the [[KGB]] was both the secret police and the [[intelligence agency]].

== History of the Soviet state security organs ==
===Detailed chronology===
[[File:19240800-dzershinsky stalin.jpg|thumb|right|Stalin and Felix Dzerzhinsky in 1924]]

*'''[[Cheka]]''' (abbreviation of ''Vecheka'', itself an acronym for "All-Russian Extraordinary Committee to Combat Counter-Revolution and Sabotage" of the [[Russian SFSR]])
**[[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] (December 20, 1917 – July 7, 1918)
**[[Yakov Peters]] (July 7, 1918 – August 22, 1918)
**[[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] (August 22, 1918 – February 6, 1922)

February 6, 1922: Cheka transforms into GPU, a department of the NKVD of the Russian SFSR.

*'''[[NKVD]]''' – "[[People's Commissariat]] for Internal Affairs"
**'''[[State Political Directorate|GPU]]''' – State Political Directorate
***Dzerzhinsky (February 6, 1922 – November 15, 1923)

November 15, 1923: GPU leaves the NKVD and becomes all-union OGPU under direct control of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the USSR.

*'''[[State Political Directorate|OGPU]]''' – "Joint State Political Directorate" or "All-Union State Political Board"
**Dzerzhinsky (November 15, 1923 – July 20, 1926)
**[[Vyacheslav Menzhinsky]] (July 30, 1926 – May 10, 1934)

July 10, 1934: NKVD of the Russian SFSR ceases to exist and transforms into the all-union NKVD of the USSR; OGPU becomes [[GUGB]] ("Main Directorate for State Security") in the all-union NKVD.

*'''[[NKVD]]''' – "People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs"
**'''[[Main Directorate of State Security|GUGB]]''' – "Main Directorate for State Security"
***[[Genrikh Yagoda]] (July 10, 1934 – September 26, 1936)
***[[Nikolai Yezhov]] (September 26, 1936 – November 25, 1938)
***[[Lavrentiy Beria]] (November, 1938 – February 3, 1941)

February 3, 1941: The GUGB of the NKVD was briefly separated out into the NKGB, then merged back in, and then on April 14, 1943 separated out again.

*'''[[People's Commissariat for State Security|NKGB]]''' – "People's Commissariat for State Security"
**[[Vsevolod Nikolayevich Merkulov|Vsevolod Merkulov]] (February 3, 1941 – July 20, 1941) (NKGB folded back into NKVD)
*'''[[NKVD]]''' – "People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs"
**'''[[Main Directorate of State Security|GUGB]]''' – "Main Directorate for State Security"
***[[Lavrentiy Beria]] (July 20, 1941 – April 14, 1943)
*'''[[People's Commissariat for State Security|NKGB]]''' – "People's Commissariat for State Security"
**Vsevolod Merkulov (April 14, 1943 – March 18, 1946) (NKGB reseparated from NKVD)

March 18, 1946: All [[People's Commissariat]]s were renamed to [[Ministry (government department)|Ministries]].

*'''[[Ministry of State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]]''' – "Ministry of State Security"
**[[Viktor Semyonovich Abakumov|Viktor Abakumov]] (March 18, 1946 – 1951)
**[[Semyon Ignatyev]] (1951 – March 5, 1953)

The [[East Germany|East German]] secret police, the [[Stasi]], took their name from this iteration.

*'''[[KI (Soviet intelligence service)|KI]]''' – "Committee of Information" (foreign intelligence service)&lt;ref&gt;[[Svetlana Chervonnaya]], KI briefing from the Russian side, H-HOAC Discussion, 17 March 2005. [http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=h-hoac&amp;month=0503&amp;week=c&amp;msg=wM0CVBemNmMqVStCKAhk6w&amp;user=&amp;pw=] Retrieved 20 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Peter Fedotov]] [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]]
**[[Fedor Kuznetsov]] [[GRU]]
**[[Yakov Malik]] [[Foreign Ministry]]

May 30, 1947: Official decision with the expressed purpose of "upgrading coordination of different intelligence services and concentrating their efforts on major directions". In the summer of 1948 the military personnel in KI were returned to the [[Soviet military]] to reconstitute foreign military intelligence service ([[GRU]]). KI sections dealing with the new [[East Bloc]] and Soviet émigrés were returned to the MGB in late 1948. In 1951 the KI returned to the MGB.

March 5, 1953: MVD and MGB are merged into the MVD by [[Lavrentiy Beria]].

*'''[[MVD]]''' – "Ministry of Internal Affairs"
**Lavrentiy Beria (March 5, 1953 – June 26, 1953)
**[[Sergei Kruglov (politician)|Sergei Kruglov]] (June, 1953 – March 13, 1954)

[[File:KGB first law.jpg|thumb|right|The 1954 [[ukase]] establishing the KGB.]]
March 13, 1954: Newly independent force became the [[KGB]], as Beria was purged and the MVD divested itself again of the functions of secret policing. After renamings and tumults, the KGB remained stable until 1991.

*'''[[KGB]]''' – Committee for State Security
**[[Ivan Serov]] (March 13, 1954 – December 8, 1958)
**[[Alexander Shelepin]] (December 25, 1958 – November 13, 1961)
**[[Vladimir Semichastny]] (November 13, 1961 – May 18, 1967)
**[[Yuri Andropov]] (May 18, 1967 – May 26, 1982)
**[[Vitaly Fedorchuk]] (May 26, 1982 – December 17, 1982)
**[[Viktor Chebrikov]] (December 17, 1982 – October 1, 1988)
**[[Vladimir Kryuchkov]] (October 1, 1988 – August 22, 1991)
**[[Leonid Shebarshin]] (August 22, 1991 – August 23, 1991) (acting)
**[[Vadim Bakatin]] (August 23, 1991 – October 22, 1991)

In 1991, after the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|State Emergency Committee]] failed to overthrow [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] and [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin]] took over, General [[Vadim Bakatin]] was given instructions to dissolve the KGB.

In Russia today, KGB functions are performed by the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)]], the [[Federal Security Service]] of the Russian Federation (FSB), and the [[Federal Protective Service (Russia)|Federal Protective Service (FSO)]]. The [[Main Intelligence Directorate|GRU]] continues to operate as well.

The '''City Mayors Foundation''', also known as '''City Mayors''', is an international think tank dedicated to urban affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newing |first=Rod |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f149eb60-6190-11df-aa80-00144feab49a.html#axzz1aIYappPj |title=Funding and social capital are key factors in financing regeneration |publisher=FT.com |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been active since 2003 and runs the biennial [[World Mayor]] award, as well as providing pro bono consultancy services.  Unlike [[Eurocities]] and [[United Cities and Local Governments]] it is wholly independent of any city.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.citymayors.com/gratis/city_mayors.html |title=City Mayors: About City Mayors  |work=citymayors.com |year=2012 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City Mayors has instituted a Code of Ethics for city leaders who wish to perform their duties beyond all reproach. Preamble from the Code: "Good and honest local government is the foundation of any nation that strives to provide its citizens with happiness, security and prosperity. Incompetence, corruption and misconduct in local government threaten fundamental decency in a society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.citymayors.com/gratis/code-ethics.html |title=City Mayors: Code of Ethics  |work=citymayors.com|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation also publishes books as an imprint on urban affairs.

The City Mayors Foundation commissions the trophy presented as the World Mayor Award. The trophy was designed by artist Manuel Ferrari and is handmade out of steel by the metalworker Kaspar Swankey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.swankeypankey.com/g004.html |title=Kaspar Swankey  |work=swankeypankey.com  |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The City Mayors Foundation was set up in 2003 by Tann vom Hove (UK/Germany), Ruth Maguire (UK), Guy Kervella (UK/France), Nick Swift (Canada) and Josh Fecht (USA). In 2004 Andrew Stevens (UK), Mayraj Fahim (USA), Tony Favro (USA) and Adriana Maciel (Mexico) joined City Mayors.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3653">"'''Common prostitute'''" is a term used in [[English law]] related to [[prostitution]]. The term was first used in the [[Vagrancy Act 1824]]. The term continued to be used in the [[Street Offences Act 1959]] which maintained the illegality of street prostitution. Section 1 stated: "It shall be an offence for a common prostitute to loiter or solicit in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Street+Offences+Act+1959%2c&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;activeTextDocId=1127916&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SortAlpha=0  Street Offences Act 1959]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was widely regarded as archaic, stigmatising, and offensive, and a number of failed attempts had been made since the 1920s to enact new legislation which would replace the wording with a solicitation law that applied to both sexes equally, and did not create an offence that could only be committed by a special class of person.
 
In 2007 the government announced that it would introduce new legislation which would eliminate the use of the term, and replace it with new language which would apply equally to males and females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Policing and Crime Act 2009 also introduced tough new measures aimed at men seeking women for the purpose of prostitution.  In particular the act makes it an offence for someone to pay or promise to pay a prostitute who has been subject to ‘exploitive conduct’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Prostitution_loitering_paying_or_soliciting_a_prostitute_subjected_to_force Prostitution loitering paying or soliciting a prostitute subjected to force] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201101807/http://wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Prostitution_loitering_paying_or_soliciting_a_prostitute_subjected_to_force |date=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The change made the customer an equal offender with the street prostitute.

[[File:Old woman draught at Ratcliffe Highway.png|thumb|250px|right|Punishing a common scold in the [[ducking stool]]]]

In the [[common law]] of [[criminal law|crime]] in [[England and Wales]], a '''common [[wiktionary:scold|scold]]''' was a type of public nuisance—a troublesome and angry person who broke the public peace by habitually chastising, arguing and quarrelling with their neighbours. The majority of individuals punished for scolding were women, though men could also be labelled scolds. 

The offence, which was exported to North America with the colonists, was punished by monetary fines, but also by methods intended to publicly humiliate such as [[cucking stool|ducking]]: being placed in a chair and submerged in a river or pond. Although rarely prosecuted it remained on the [[statute book]]s in England and Wales until 1967.

==The offence and its punishment==

=== Medieval England ===
The offence of scolding developed from the late middle ages in England. It has been suggested that attempts to control and punish 'bad speech' increased after the [[Black Death in England|Black Death]], when demographic shift led to greater resistance and threats to the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bardsley|first=Sandy|date=2006|title=Sin, Speech and Scolding in Late Medieval England|url=|journal=Fama: The Politics of Talk and Reputation in Medieval Europe, ed. Thelma Fenster and Daniel Lord Smail|volume=|pages=146-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included prosecutions for scolding. Scolds were described using a number of Latin terms, including ''objurgator, garulator, rixator'' and ''litigator'', found in both masculine and feminine forms in medieval legal records and all referring to negative forms of speech, chatter, quarrelling or reproachment. Scolding offences were commonly presented and punished in [[Manorial court|manorial]] and borough courts that governed the behaviour of peasants and townspeople across England. Scolds were also presented in church courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65767599|title=Gender and petty crime in late medieval England : the local courts in Kent, 1460-1560|last=Jones|first=Karen|date=2006|publisher=Boydell Press|year=|isbn=184383216X|location=Woodbridge|pages=104-106|oclc=65767599}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common punishment was a monetary fine.

Various historians have argued that scolding and bad speech were coded as feminine offences by the late medieval period. Women of all marital statuses were prosecuted for scolding, though married women featured most frequently, while widows were rarely labelled scolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=123-125|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places, such as Exeter, scolds were typically poorer women, whereas elsewhere scolds could include members of the local elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=135-136|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who were also charged with other offences, such as violence, nightwandering, eavesdropping or sexual impropriety were also likely to be labelled scolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=137|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals were frequently labelled 'common scolds', indicating the impact of their behaviour and speech on the whole community. Karen Jones identified 13 men prosecuted for scolding in Kent's secular courts, compared to 94 women and 2 couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65767599|title=Gender and petty crime in late medieval England : the local courts in Kent, 1460-1560|last=1939-|first=Jones, Karen,|date=2006|publisher=Boydell Press|year=|isbn=184383216X|location=Woodbridge|pages=108|oclc=65767599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men accused of scolding were often charged alongside their wives. Helen, wife of Peter Bradwall scolded Hugh Welesson and Isabel, his wife, in Middlewich in 1434, calling Isabel a "child murderer" and Hugh a "skallet [wretched] knave". Isabel and Hugh also scolded Helen, calling her a "lesyng blebberer" (lying bletherer). All parties were fined for the offences, though Hugh and Isabel were fined jointly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=102|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like women, male scolds were often accused of many other offences, such as fornication, theft, illegal trading, and assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=103|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later punishments of scolding ===
Later legal treatises reflected the dominance of scolding as a female offence. In the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]] says of this offence:

{{quote|text=Lastly, a common scold, {{lang|la|communis rixatrix}}, (for our law-latin confines it to the feminine gender) is a public nuisance to her neighbourhood. For which offence she may be indicted; and, if convicted, shall be sentenced to be placed in a certain engine of correction called the trebucket, castigatory, or cucking stool, which in the Saxon language signifies the scolding stool; though now it is frequently corrupted into ducking stool, because the residue of the judgment is, that, when she is so placed therein, she shall be plunged in the water for her punishment.|sign=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Bl. Comm.]] IV:13.5.8, p. *169}} 
[[Image:The Branks from Curious Punishments of Bygone Days (1896) - 02.jpg|thumb|right|Scold's bridles or branks were probably used as a punishment but no official records of their use have been found.]]
The prescribed penalty for this offence involved dunking the convicted offender in water in an instrument called the "[[cucking stool]]".  The cucking stool, according to Blackstone, eventually became known as a ''ducking stool'' by [[folk etymology]].

Other writers disagree with Blackstone's assertion equating the two sorts of punishment seat.  The ''[[Domesday Book]]'' notes the use of a cucking stool at [[Chester]], a seat also known as {{lang|la|cathedra stercoris}}, a "dung chair", whose punishment apparently involved exposing the sitter's buttocks to onlookers.  This seat served to punish not only scolds, but also brewers and bakers who sold bad ale or bread, whereas the ducking stool dunked its victim into the water. [[Francois Maximilian Misson]], a French traveller and writer, recorded the method used in England in the early 18th century:&lt;ref name="AME"&gt;{{cite book |title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days |chapter=The Ducking Stool |author=Alice Morse Earle |year=1896 |url=http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-2.html |accessdate=18 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117004233/http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-2.html |archivedate=17 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The way of punishing scolding women is pleasant enough. They fasten an armchair to the end of two beams twelve or fifteen feet long, and parallel to each other, so that these two pieces of wood with their two ends embrace the chair, which hangs between them by a sort of axle, by which means it plays freely, and always remains in the natural horizontal position in which a chair should be, that a person may sit conveniently in it, whether you raise it or let it down. They set up a post on the bank of a pond or river, and over this post they lay, almost in equilibrio, the two pieces of wood, at one end of which the chair hangs just over the water. They place the woman in this chair and so plunge her into the water as often as the sentence directs, in order to cool her immoderate heat.}}

The ducking stool, rather than being fixed in position by the river or pond, could be mounted on wheels to allow the convicted woman to be paraded through the streets before punishment was carried out. Another method of ducking was to use the tumbrel, which consisted of a chair on two wheels with two long shafts fixed to the axles. This would be pushed into the ducking pond and the shafts would be released, tipping the chair up backwards and ducking the occupant.&lt;ref name="ne"&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Ducking and Cucking Stools |volume=8 |page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[scold's bridle]], known in Scotland as a brank, consists of a locking metal mask or [[head cage]] that contains a tab that fits in the mouth to inhibit talking. Some have claimed that convicted common scolds had to wear such a device as a preventive or punitive measure. Legal sources do not mention them in the context of the punishment of common scolds, but there are anecdotal reports of their historical use as a public punishment.&lt;ref name="Dugdale"&gt;{{cite book|title=England and Wales Delineated: Historical, Entertaining &amp; Commercial|author=Thomas Dugdale, William Burnett|year=1860|pages=1238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LandC"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire|author=Frederick W. Fairholt|title=On a Grotesque Mask of Punishment Obtained in the Castle of Nuremberg|publisher=J.H. Parker for the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire|location= 377, Strand. London|year=1855|pages=62–64|volume=VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 17th-century [[New England]] and [[Long Island]], scolds or those convicted of similar offences—both men and women—could be sentenced to stand with their tongue in a cleft stick, a more primitive but easier-to-construct version of the scold's bridle,&lt;ref name="AME2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days|chapter=Branks and gags|author=Alice Morse Earle|year=1896|url=http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-8.html|accessdate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ducking stool also made the trip across the Atlantic.&lt;ref name="AME" /&gt;

==Historical prosecutions==
[[Image:The Ducking-Stool from Curious Punishments of Bygone Days (1896).jpg|right|thumb|This [[woodcut]] shows the wheels on the ducking stool which allowed the occupant to be wheeled through the streets before being ducked.]]

A plaque on the Fye Bridge in [[Norwich]], England claims to mark the site of a "cucking" stool, and that from 1562–1597 "[[strumpet]]s" and common scolds suffered the punishment of dunking there.  In the ''Percy Anecdotes'', published pseudonymously by [[Thomas Byerley (journalist)|Thomas Byerley]] and [[Joseph Clinton Robertson]] in 1821{{ndash}}23, the authors state that "How long the ducking-stool has been in disuse in England does not appear."&lt;ref name="percy"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Percy Anecdotes|author=[[Reuben Percy]] and [[Sholto Percy]]|year=1823|publisher=Printed for T. Boys|location=London|url=http://www.mspong.org/percy/crime.htm#TheDuckingStool|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040910073842/http://www.mspong.org/percy/crime.htm#TheDuckingStool|archivedate=10 September 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Anecdotes'' also suggest [[penology|penological]] ineffectiveness as grounds for the stool's disuse; the text relates the 1681 case of a Mrs. Finch, who according to this account had received three convictions and duckings as a common scold.  On her fourth conviction, the [[King's Bench]] declined to dunk her again, and instead ordered her to pay a fine of three [[mark (money)|marks]], and ordered her imprisoned until payment took place.

The ''Percy Anecdotes'' also quote a pastoral poem by [[John Gay]] (1685{{ndash}}1732), who wrote that:

{{poemquote|I'll speed me to the pond, where the high stool
On the long plank, hangs o'er the muddy pool,
That stool the dread of ev'ry scolding quean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spenserians.cath.vt.edu/TextRecord.php?textsid=33871 |title=The Shepherd's Week : Wednesday; or, The Dumps |author=John Gay |date=1714 |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and a 1780 poem by [[Benjamin West]], who wrote that:

{{poemquote|There stands, my friend, in yonder pool,
An engine call'd a ducking-stool;
By legal pow'r commanded down,
The joy and terror of the town.
If jarring females kindle strife...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34005/34005-h/34005-h.htm#Page_11 |title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days |author=Alice Morse Earle |website=Project Gutenberg |date=1896 |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While these literary sources do not prove that the punishment still took place, they do provide evidence that it had not been forgotten.

In ''The Queen v. Foxby'', 6 Mod. 11 (1704), counsel for the accused stated that he knew of no law for the dunking of scolds.  Lord Chief Justice [[John Holt (judge)|John Holt]] of the Queen's Bench apparently pronounced this error, for he announced that it was "better ducking in a [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]], than a [[Michaelmas]] [[quarter Sessions|term]]", i.e. better carried out in summer than in winter.  The tenor of Holt's remarks however suggests that he found the punishment an antiquarian curiosity and something of a joke.&lt;ref name="fc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendVIIIs19.html|title=The Founders Constitution:Volume 5, Amendment VIII, Document 19|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last recorded uses of the stool for ducking involve a Mrs. Ganble at [[Plymouth]] (1808) and Jenny Pipes, a notorious scold from  [[Leominster]] (1809). In 1817 Sarah Leeke, also from Leominster was sentenced to be ducked but the water in the pond was so low that the authorities merely wheeled her round the town in the chair.&lt;ref name="ne" /&gt;

The English common law as received by the law of the United States included the offence of being a common scold.  In 1829, a Washington, D.C. court found the American [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] writer [[Anne Royall]] guilty of being a common scold, the outcome of a campaign launched against her by local clergymen.  Despite the construction of the traditional engine of punishment by sailors at the Navy Yard, the court ruled the punishment of the cucking-stool obsolete, and instead improvised a fine of ten dollars.&lt;ref name="LC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0001/royall.html|title=An Uncommon Scold|publisher=Library of Congress|author=Cynthia Earman|date=January 2001|accessdate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status of the law==
In England and Wales, the only part of the United Kingdom where the law had any effect, no prosecutions of common scolds occurred for a considerable period.{{vague|date=November 2017}} Counsel in ''Sykes v. Director of Public Prosecutions'' [1962] AC 528 described the offence as "obsolete", and section 13(1)(a) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] eventually abolished it.

The common law offence of being a common scold was extant in New Jersey until struck down in 1972 by Circuit Judge McCann who found it had been subsumed in the provisions of the Disorderly Conduct Act of 1898, was bad for vagueness and offended the [[14th Amendment to the US Constitution]] for sex discrimination. Long before this decision, the punishment of ducking, together with all other forms of corporeal punishment, had become unlawful under the provisions of the [[New Jersey Constitution of 1844]] or even as early as 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=State of New Jersey v.

None of these laws carry the distinctive punishment originally reserved for the common scold, nor are they gender-specific as the common scold offense was.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18007">'''Concrete art''' was an art movement with a strong emphasis on geometrical abstraction. The term was first formulated by [[Theo van Doesburg]] and was then used by him in 1930 to define the difference between his vision of art and that of other abstract artists of the time. After his death in 1931, the term was further defined and popularized by [[Max Bill]], who organized the first international exhibition in 1944 and went on to help promote the style in [[Latin America]]. The term was taken up widely after World War 2 and promoted through a number of international exhibitions and art movements.

==Origination==
[[File:Art Concret vol 01 no 01 front cover 01.jpg|thumb|''Revue Art Concret'', May 1930.]]
After the formal break up of [[De stijl]], following the last issue of its magazine in 1928, van Doesburg began considering the creation of a new collective centered on a similar approach to abstraction. In 1929 he discussed his plans with Uruguayan painter [[Joaquín Torres-García]], with candidates for membership of this group including [[Georges Vantongerloo]], [[Constantin Brancusi]], [[František Kupka]], [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Friedrich Vordemberge-Gildewart]] and [[Antoine Pevsner]], among others. However, van Doesburg divided the candidates between artists whose work was still not completely abstract and those free of referentiality. As this classification entailed the possibility of a disqualification of the first group, the discussions between the two soon broke down, prompting Torres-García to team up instead with Belgian critic [[Michel Seuphor]] and form the group [[Cercle et Carré]].&lt;ref&gt;Wintgens Hötte, Doris (2009) "Van Doesburg tackles the continent: passion, drive &amp; calculation", in: Gladys Fabre &amp; Doris Wintgens Hötte (red.): ''Van Doesburg &amp; the International Avant-Garde: Constructing a New World'', London, Tate Publishing, 2010, pp. 10-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, van Doesburg proceeded to propose a rival group, ''[[Art Concret]]'', championing a geometrical [[abstract art]] closely related to the aesthetics of [[Neo-plasticism]]. In his opinion, the term ‘abstract’ as applied to art had negative connotations; in its place he preferred the more positive term ‘concrete’.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Luc Daval, "Avant Garde Art 1914-1939", Skira, Geneva 1980, p.171&lt;/ref&gt;  Van Doesburg was eventually joined by [[Otto Gustaf Carlsund|Otto G. Carlsund]], [[Léon Arthur Tutundjian]], [[Jean Hélion]] and his fellow lodger, the typographer [[Marcel Wantz]] (1911-79), who soon left to take up a political career.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Hélion, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ROXpBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT202&amp;dq=Marcel%20Wantz&amp;pg=PT202#v=onepage&amp;q=Marcel%20Wantz&amp;f=false "Art Concret 1930: Four Painters and a Magazine”], in ''Double Rhythm: Writings About Painting'', Skyhorse Publishing 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1930 they published a single issue of their own French-language magazine, ''Revue Art Concret'', which featured a joint [[manifesto]], positioning them as the more radical group of abstractionists.

"'''BASIS OF CONCRETE PAINTING'''&lt;br&gt;
We say:
# Art is universal.
# A work of art must be entirely conceived and shaped by the mind before its execution. It shall not receive anything of nature’s or sensuality’s or sentimentality’s formal data. We want to exclude lyricism, drama, symbolism, and so on.
# The painting must be entirely built up with purely plastic elements, namely surfaces and colors. A pictorial element does not have any meaning beyond “itself”; as a consequence, a painting does not have any meaning other than “itself”.
# The construction of a painting, as well as that of its elements, must be simple and visually controllable.
# The painting technique must be mechanic, i.e., exact, anti-impressionistic.
# An effort toward absolute clarity is mandatory."&lt;ref&gt; [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-1-4614-7052-6%2F1.pdf Springer p.413-4]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group was short lived and only exhibited together on three occasions in 1930 as part of larger group exhibitions, the first being at the ''Salon des Surindépendents'' in June, followed by ''Production Paris 1930'' in [[Zürich]], and in August the exhibition ''AC: Internationell utställning av postkubistisk konst'' (International exhibition of post-cubist art) in [[Stockholm]], curated by Carlsund. In the catalog to the latter, Carlsund states that the group's "programme is clear: absolute Purism. [[Neo-Plasticism]], [[Purism (arts)|Purism]] and [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] combined".&lt;ref&gt;''AC: Internationell utställning av postkubistisk konst'', Stockholm, 1930, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before van Doesburg's death in 1931, the members of the Art Concret group still active in Paris united with the larger association [[Abstraction-Création]].

==Theoretical background==
{{further|Mathematics and art }}
In 1930, [[Michel Seuphor]] had defined the role of the abstract artist in the first issue of ''Cercle et Carré''. It was “to establish, on the foundations of a structure that is simple, severe and unadorned in every part, and within a basis of unconcealed narrow unity with this structure, an architecture which, using the technical means available to its period, expresses in a clear language that which is truly immanent and immutable.”&lt;ref&gt;Jean Luc Daval, "Avant Garde Art 1914-1939, Skira, Geneva 1980", p.171&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian Werner Haftmann traces the development of the pure abstraction proposed by Seuphor to the synthesis of Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and Dutch [[Neo-Plasticism]] in the [[Bauhaus]], where painting abandoned the artificiality of representation for technological authenticity.  “In close connection with architecture and engineering, art should endeavour to give form to life itself … [The former] provided new sources of inspiration as well as new materials – steel, aluminium, glass, synthetic materials.”&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann p.285&lt;/ref&gt; 

As van Doesburg had pointed out in his manifesto, in order to be universal, art must abandon subjectivity and find impersonal inspiration purely in the elements of which it is constructed: line, plane and color. Some later artists associated with this tendency, such as [[Victor Vasarély]], [[Jean Dewasne]], [[Mario Negro]] and [[Richard Mortensen]], only came to painting after first studying science.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann p.340&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, all theoretical advances seek justification in past practice, and in this case the mathematical proportions expressed in abstract form are to be identified in various art forms over millennia. Thus, argued Hartmann, “the elimination of representational images and the overt use of pure geometry do not imply a radical and definitive rejection of the great art of the past, but rather a reassertion of its eternal values stripped of their historical and social disguises.”&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann p.341&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:FFM Sculpture Kontinuitaet 2012 Max Bill 1986 6.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Max Bill]], ''Continuity (Colossus of Frankfurt),'' 1986, collection: [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Frankfurt am Main]]. Max Bill "was keen on creating works based on mathematical and geometric foundations—material manifestations of intellectual processes that resisted symbolism." &lt;ref&gt;[http://db-artmag.de/en/66/news/max-bills-continuity-in-a-new-location/  Monolith on the Water—Max Bill’s "Continuity" in a New Location; Deutsche Bank Art works]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While Abstraction-Création was a grouping of all modernistic tendencies, there were those within it who carried the idea of mathematically inspired art and the term ‘concrete art’ to other countries when they moved elsewhere. A key figure among them was Joaquin Torres García, who returned to South America in 1934 and mentored artists there. Some of those went on to found the group [[Madí|''Arte Concreto Invención'']] in Buenos Aires in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Stiles&lt;/ref&gt; Another was the designer [[Max Bill]], who had studied at the [[Bauhaus]] in 1927-9. After returning to Switzerland, he helped organize the [[Allianz (arts)|Allianz]] group to champion the ideals of Concrete Art. In 1944 he organized the first international exhibition in Basle and at the same time founded ''abstract-konkret'', the monthly bulletin of the Gallerie des Eaux Vives in Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;Stiles&lt;/ref&gt; By 1960 Bill was organizing a large retrospective exhibition of Concrete Art in Zürich illustrating 50 years of its development.

Abstraction, which had been quietly gathering momentum in Italy between the world wars, emerged officially in the [http://www.kettererkunst.com/dict/movimento-arte-concreta.shtml ''Movimento d'arte concreta''] (MAC) in 1948, whose foremost exponent, [[Alberto Magnelli]], was another past member of Abstraction-Création and had been living in France for many years. However, some seventy native painters were represented in the ''Arte astratta e concreta in Italia'' exhibition held three years later at the National Gallery in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, p.340&lt;/ref&gt; In Paris recognition of this approach resulted in several exhibitions of which the first was titled ''Art Concret'' and held at the Gallerie René Drouin during the summer of 1945. Described as "the first major post-World War 2 exhibition of abstract art”,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Lee Morgan, ''Historical Dictionary of Contemporary Art'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2016&lt;/ref&gt; the artists exhibited there included the older generation of abstractionists: [[Jean Arp]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[César Domela]], [[Otto Freundlich]], [[Jean Gorin]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], Alberto Magnelli, Piet Mondrian, Antoine Pevsner and van Doesburg. In the following year a series of annual exhibitions began in the [[Salon des Réalités Nouvelles]], which included some of these artists and were devoted, according to its articles of association, to “works of art commonly called: concrete art, non-figurative or abstract art".&lt;ref&gt;Georges Folmer, "Le Salon des Réalités Nouvelles : pour et contre l’art concret", [http://www.folmer.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/salondesrealitesnouvelles.pdf p.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 [http://www.kunstzolder.be/en/movement/groupe-espace Groupe Espace] was founded in France to harmonize painting, sculpture and architecture as a single discipline. This grouped sculptors and architects with old established artists such as Sonia Delaunay and Jean Gorin and the newly emergent Jean Dewasne and Victor Vasarély. Its manifesto was published in ''L’Architecture d’Aujourd’hui'' that year and placarded on the streets of Paris, championing its aim of the harmonious development of all human activities. It extended beside into practical politics, having elected as its honorary president the Minister for Reconstruction and Urban Development, [[Eugène Claudius-Petit]].&lt;ref&gt;Eve Roy, [http://musees-nationaux-alpesmaritimes.fr/fleger/sites/musees-nationaux-alpesmaritimes.fr/files/eve_roy_la_pre_sence_fondamentale_de_la_plastique_19_avril_2013.pdf  “La présence fondamentale de la plastique, L’exposition du Groupe Espace à Biot en 1954: un essai de synthèse des arts”], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

As time progressed, a distinction began to be made between ‘cold abstraction’, which was identified with geometric Concrete Art, and ‘warm abstraction’, which, as it moved towards the various kinds of [[Lyrical abstraction]], reintroduced personality into art.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Moszynska, Abstract Art, Thames &amp; Hudson, London 1990, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; The former eventually fed into international movements building on technological aspects championed by the pioneers of Concrete Art, emerging as [[optical art]], [[kinetic art]] and programmatic art.&lt;ref name=DelPuppo2013&gt;Alessandro Del Puppo, ''L'arte contemporanea: Il secondo novecento'', Einaudi, 2013, table 3 page 238.&lt;/ref&gt; The term Concrete also began to be extended to other disciplines than painting, including sculpture, photography and poetry. Justification for this was theorized in South America in the 1959 [[Neo-Concrete Movement|Neo-Concrete Manifesto]], written by a group of artists in Rio de Janeiro who included [[Lygia Clark]], [[Hélio Oiticica]] and [[Lygia Pape]].&lt;ref&gt;Stiles&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Formation of coral.jpg|thumb|upright|Formation of fringing reefs (top), barrier reefs (middle) and atolls (bottom).&lt;ref name=noaa /&gt;]]
One of the marine ecosystems found in the [[Virgin Islands]] are the [[coral reef]]s. These coral reefs can be located between the islands of [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Croix]], [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], and [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. John]]. These coral reefs have an area of 297.9 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, along with other marine habitats that are in between.&lt;ref name="First"&gt;Catanzaro, Don, Rick Nemeth, Caroline Rogers, Zandy Hillis-Starr, and Marcia Taylor, [https://www.coris.noaa.gov/portals/pdfs/status_coralreef_usvi.pdf "The Status of the Coral Reefs of The U.S. Virgin Islands"]&lt;/ref&gt; The way these coral reefs grow are by coral larvae swimming freely and attaching themselves to hard surfaces around the islands and start to develop a skeleton on the outside of their skin to protect themselves from predators but also allow a new place for other coral larvae to attach to and grow on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coral.org/coral-reefs-101/coral-reef-ecology/how-coral-reefs-grow/ "How Coral Reefs Grow"] Coral Reef Alliance.&lt;/ref&gt; These corals can form into three different structures; [[fringing reef]]s, which are reefs that are close to the shore, barrier reefs, which are reefs that are alongside the shore and is separated by deep water, and an [[atoll reef]] which is a coral reef that circles a [[lagoon]] or body of water.&lt;ref name=noaa&gt;[http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/corals/coral04_reefs.html "Corals"] NOAA National Ocean Service Education: Corals.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution == 
As stated, the coral reefs such as fringing reefs, [[Deep-water coral|deep reef]]s, patch reefs and [[spur and groove formation]] are distributed over three islands in the Virgin Islands which are St. Croix ([[Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve]], [[Buck Island Reef National Monument]]), St. Thomas, and St. John ([[Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument]]). The coral reefs found offshore of St. Thomas and St. John  are distributed patchily around the islands. Additionally, a developed barrier reef system surrounds St. Croix along its eastern and southern shores.[[File:Corals 4.jpg|thumb|Corals picture taken from Brewers Bay on St. Thomas.]]

== Ecology ==
The coral reefs as well as hard-bottom habitat accounts for 297.9 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt; The coral reefs are home to diverse species. There are over 40 species of [[scleractinian corals]] and three species of [[Millepora]].&lt;ref name="fourth"&gt;Caldow, Chris, Barry Devine, Peter Edmunds et al. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227125836_Ecology_of_Coral_Reefs_in_the_US_Virgin_Islands "Ecology of Coral Reefs in the US Virgin Islands"] (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Live scleractinian species are found throughout the Virgin Islands, but mainly around [[Buck Island Reef National Monument|Buck Island]], St. Croix and St. John.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt; More specifically based on a survey from 2001-2006, listed are a total of 215 fishes from St. John and 202 from St. Croix.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; Four species of [[sea turtle]]s are found within the Virgin Islands.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; The coral reefs are impacted by freshwater environments from the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and [[Orinoco River]] in the form of anticyclonic rings which are rich in nutrients.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== Hazards ==
This marine environment has been degraded in a variety of ways. One of the ways in which the corals have been affected is by the dust from Africa.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; This dust might be affected the corals by causing degradation.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; Apart from the dust, the corals also experience a few diseases. There is [[black band disease|black-band disease]] which infects major coral reefs such as [[Montastraea annularis]].&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; The most severe diseases are the [[white band disease|white-band]] and [[white plague (coral disease)|white plague]] disease.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; The branching acroporid have been influenced the most.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Corals 5.jpg|thumb|Corals picture taken from Brewers Bay on St. Thomas]]
Other than the few diseases listed, other ways in which the corals have been affected are by natural disasters such as hurricanes, human influence such as fishing and pollution, and global warming.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Coral reefs are also being degraded by many other factors:&lt;br /&gt;
* Natural Disasters: coral reefs experience natural disturbance events that can affect and dramatically altered the reef ecosystem. Disasters include hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis. 
* Tourism: The [[United States Virgin Islands]] are a popular tourist destination with over two million cruise ship passenger arrivals per year. Tourism generates vast amounts of income for USVI, however, tourism pressures can cause physical damage to the coral reefs. For example, recreation activities (scuba diving and snorkeling), disposal of untreated sewage and poorly placed boat anchors by cruise ships.
* Coastal development: tourism leads to construction projects such as building of hotels and restaurants, coral reefs habitats are destroyed or disturbed by dredging activities and nutrients and sediment run-off.
* Pollution: Pollution from human activities is damaging reefs. Humans dispose unwanted items on beaches, in the sea or near water pathways.
* Overfishing and destructive fishing methods: the coral reefs have been heavily fished due to increasing demand for food. Overfishing of important reef species negatively impact the coral reefs’ biodiversity and ecological. Additionally, some destructive means of fishing are used on coral reefs including [[Blast fishing|dynamite]] and [[Cyanide fishing|cyanide]]. These practices often kill fishes and destroy fragile coral reefs. Degrading the coral reef habitat on which the fishes rely on will in turn reduce the productivity of the area.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt;

The divisions are [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic in size]], with base 10.  Each successive cosmological decade represents a [[ten-fold]] increase in the total [[age of the universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==As expressed in log (seconds per Ðecade)==
When CÐ is measured in log(&amp;nbsp;seconds/Ð&amp;nbsp;), ''CÐ''&amp;nbsp;1 begins at 10 [[second]]s and lasts 90 seconds (until 100 seconds after [[Time Zero]]).  ''CÐ''&amp;nbsp;100, the 100th cosmological decade, lasts from 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;101&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after Time Zero.  CÐ&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; is Time Zero.

The [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] ''CÐ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;43.2683 was 10&lt;sup&gt;(&amp;minus;43.2683)&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, which represents the [[Planck time]] since the [[big bang]] (Time Zero).  There were an infinite number of cosmological decades between the Big Bang and the Planck epoch (or any other point in time).  The current epoch, ''CÐ''&amp;nbsp;17.6389, is 10&lt;sup&gt;(17.6389)&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, or 13.799(21) billion years, since the Big Bang.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt; {{cite journal

==As expressed in log (years per Ðecade)==
The cosmological decade can be expressed in log years per decade. In this definition, the 100th cosmological decade lasts from 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; years to 10&lt;sup&gt;101&lt;/sup&gt; years after Time Zero.  To convert to this format, simply divide by seconds per year; or in logarithmic terms, subtract 7.4991116 from the values listed above. Thus when CÐ is expressed in log( years/Ð ), the Planck time could also be expressed as 10&lt;sup&gt;(&amp;minus;43.2683&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;7.4991116)&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years = 10&lt;sup&gt;(&amp;minus;50.7674)&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years.

In this definition, the current epoch is CÐ (17.6355&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;7.4991116), or CÐ&amp;nbsp;10.1364. As before, there have been 60.9 cosmological decades between the Planck epoch and the current epoch.

In their view, the history of the universe can be segmented into five eras:

==Academic background==
His academic background includes different universities, such as Universidad Católica de Chile and Université Catholique de Louvain, where he got his training; Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano and Universidad de Santiago de Chile, where he has worked preferentially.

During his academic career he has contributed to the sociology of religion and culture, publishing various works in this field of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blasi|first1=Anthony|title=Sociology of Religion Searchable Bibliographic Database|url=http://www.thearda.com/rrh/resources/citations.asp?searchterms=cristi%E1n+parker&amp;incTitle=T&amp;incAuthor=T&amp;incAnnotation=T&amp;incPubInfo=T&amp;incBooks=T&amp;incPublications=T&amp;incTheses=T&amp;incDissertations=T&amp;pubStartYear=&amp;pubEndYear=&amp;p=Z&amp;c=ZABCDEF&amp;m=50&amp;sf=Citations&amp;t=Search+Citations&amp;pg=citations.asp|website=Association of Religion Data Archives|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 he published a book on popular religions and modernization in Latin America, under the title “Otra Lógica en América Latina, Religión popular y modernización capitalista”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=Cristián|title=Otra Lógica en América Latina, Religión popular y modernización capitalista|date=1996|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica|location=Santiago y México|isbn=9567083088|pages=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has authored or coautored 22 books and 81 book chapters and 91 publications in scientific journals; he has also given conferences in no less than 15 Chilean universities and in 30 universities in America, Europe and Asia (258 presentations or conferences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Cristián|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/c6b930_d8da955aeffc4ae9bfcdc1b4fcff1727.pdf|website=Parker Sociologo|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been Director of the School of Sociology, Dean of Social Science (1989-1995) at the [[Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano]], and then he was Vice-president of Research and Development (2002-2003) and Director of the  [[:es:Instituto de Estudios Avanzados (Universidad de Santiago de Chile)|Institute for Advanced Studies]] of the Universidad de Santiago de Chile (2005- 2010).
He has been a consultant for [[UNICEF]], [[UNDP]], [[ECLAC]], FLACSO-Ecuador, and various public agencies in Chile, among them ministries of Education, of Development and Justice. In addition he has lectured in Research Methodology in the Academia Diplomática de Chile (2004-2012) and the Master's program in Military History and Strategic Thought of the War Academy of the Chilean Army (2004-2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Cristián|title=Bio / CV|url=http://www.parkersociologo.com/|website=Parker Sociologo|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to Sociology==
It has been stated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cipriani|first1=Roberto|title=Manual de Sociología de la Religión|date=2011|publisher=Siglo Veintiuno Editores|location=Buenos Aires|isbn=978-987-629-194-1|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that the work of C. Parker enables a complete knowledge of popular culture with an empathic and participative approach on the “culture of the poor”. His contribution to the sociology of religion, underscoring its cultural character, rich in creativity, has led to the reevaluation of lived religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGuire|first1=Meredith|title=Lived Religion. Faith and Practice in Everyday Life|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195368338|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., to the noninstitutional character of religion. That is why his criticisms of the ecclesiocentric bias of the sociology of western religion have been the subject of relevant publications.
According to Roberto Cipriani, Cristián Parker in his work “has analyzed with scientífic rigor the crossing of popular and official culture, revealing congruences and incongruences, points of contact and contrast through theoretical and empirical work made along a trip that has lasted 30 years, aimed at discovering what he calls the “other logic” of popular culture (...). On the other hand, an extensive analysis of the relation between religion and politics from a democratic perspective is not missing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cipriani|first1=Roberto|title=Manual de Sociología de la Religión|date=2011|publisher=Siglo Veintiuno Editores|location=Buenos Aires|isbn=978-987-629-194-1|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of C. Parker is consulted by specialists and those interested in Latin America’s sociocultural and religious evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Llambías|first1=Jaime|title=América Latina : interrogantes y prespectivas|date=2013|publisher=York University Bookstore|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55014-583-0|pages=205–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Parker has contributed to the sociology of development, especially in his analysis of new ways of understanding the relation between culture and development. In particular, he has conducted research on the social representations of social actors challenged by the radical scientific and technological innovations in the context of unequal globalization and on the environmental crisis, climate change, and energy transition in South American societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Cristian|last2=Letelier|first2=Mario|last3=Muñoz|first3=Juan|title=Elites, climate change and agency in a developing society: the Chilean case|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|date=20 March 2013|volume=15|issue=5|pages=1337–1363|doi=10.1007/s10668-013-9444-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social commitment==
During the time in which Chile was governed under the dictatorship of General [[Augusto Pinochet]], he became an active actor of a Catholic church and of the ecumenical efforts in defense of human rights and the return to democracy. In those days he became committed with the Church's base communities that fought inspired by the Liberation Theology.
As the country turned to democracy, and after the [[Chilean national plebiscite, 1988]] and the election of [[Patricio Aylwin]] as president of the democratic Concertación, he oriented his life toward academic work.
During this time he has contributed in key and strategic issues of the social sciences for the construction of democracy in Chile: development of indigenous people, overcoming poverty, social and political participation of youngsters, ethics and democracy, and the challenges of climate change and sustainable development.

'''Deep level underground''' refers to constructions 20 metres or more below ground and not using the [[cut and cover]] method, especially train stations, air raid shelters and bunkers and some tunnels and mines. Cut-and-cover is a simple method of construction for shallow tunnels where a trench is excavated and roofed over with an overhead support system strong enough to carry the load of what is to be built above the tunnel.

==History==
Although some deep mining took place as early as the late Tudor period (in the North East, and along the Firth of Forth coast) deep [[shaft mining]] in Britain began to develop extensively in the late 18th century, with rapid expansion throughout the 19th century and early 20th century when the industry peaked. Before 1800 a great deal of coal was left in places as extraction was still primitive. As a result, in the deep Tyneside pits (300 to 1,000&amp;nbsp;ft deep) only about 40 percent of the coal could be extracted. The use of wooden pit props to support the roof was an innovation first introduced about 1800.

{{main article|London Underground infrastructure#Subsurface versus deep-level tube lines}}
Before any plans were made for transit systems with underground tunnels and stations, several railway operators had used tunnels for freight and passenger trains, usually to reduce the grade of the railway line. Examples include Trevithick's Tunnel from 1804, built for the Penydarren locomotive, the 1829 Crown Street Tunnel at Liverpool and the {{convert|1.13|mi|m|abbr=off}} long 1836 Lime Street Tunnel also at Liverpool, of which a part is still used today making it the world's oldest used tunnel.

The first urban underground railway was the Metropolitan Railway, which began operations on January 10, 1863. It was built largely in shallow tunnels (see more at cut and cover) and is now part of the London Underground. It was worked by steam trains, and despite the creation of numerous vents, was unhealthy and uncomfortable for passengers and operating staff. Nevertheless, its trains were popular from the start and the Metropolitan Railway and the competing Metropolitan District Railway developed the inner circle around central London (completed in 1884) and an extensive system of suburban branches to the northwest (extending into the adjoining countryside), the west, the southwest and the east (mostly completed by 1904).

[[Liverpool James Street railway station]] together with [[Hamilton Square station|Hamilton Square underground station]] in Birkenhead are the oldest deep level underground stations in the world, London's underground stations were just below the street surface built via the cut and cover method. The stations were so deep they required lifts to access easily, this gave another world's first in having the first lift accessed stations. The lifts were hydraulically operated.
For the first deep-level tube line, the City and South London Railway, two {{convert|10|ft|2|in|m}} diameter circular tunnels were dug between King William Street (close to today's Monument station) and Stockwell, under the roads to avoid the need for agreement with owners of property on the surface. This opened in 1890 with electric locomotives that hauled carriages with small opaque windows, nicknamed padded cells.

==Construction==
Cut-and-cover is a simple method of construction for shallow tunnels where a trench is excavated and roofed over with an overhead support system strong enough to carry the load of what is to be built above the tunnel. 
Modern Deep level Construction is by tunnel boring machines.
The Circle, District, Hammersmith &amp; City, and Metropolitan lines are services that run on the sub-surface network that has railway tunnels just below the surface and built mostly using the "cut-and-cover" method. The tunnels and trains are of a similar size to those on British main lines. The Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines share all their stations and most of the track with other lines. The Bakerloo, Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly, Victoria and Waterloo &amp; City lines are deep-level tubes, with smaller trains that run in two circular tunnels with a diameter of about {{convert|11|ft|8|in|m}}, lined with cast-iron or precast concrete rings, which were bored using a tunnelling shield. It is these that were the tube lines, although since the 1950s the term "tube" has come to be used to refer to the whole London Underground system.

==Deepest train stations==
Some London Underground are deep level stations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ianvisits.co.uk/blog/2011/07/01/how-deep-is-every-tube-station-on-the-underground/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://underground-history.co.uk/deeplevel.php&lt;/ref&gt;
Operated by Great Northern, [[Essex Road railway station]] is the only deep level underground station in London served solely by National Rail trains.

==Deepest mines==

* The deepest mines in the world are the [[TauTona]] (Western Deep Levels) and Savuka [[Gold mining|gold]] mines in the [[Witwatersrand]] region of [[South Africa]], which are currently working at depths exceeding {{convert|3900|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2009 |title=TauTona, Anglo Gold, South Africa |url=http://www.mining-technology.com/projects/tautona_goldmine/ |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are plans to extend [[Mponeng Gold Mine|Mponeng mine]], a sister mine to TauTona, down to {{convert|4500|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the coming years.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
* This region is also the location of the harshest conditions for hard rock mining, where workers toil in temperatures of up to {{convert|45|°C}}. However, massive refrigeration plants are used to bring the air temperature down to around {{convert|28|°C}}.
* The deepest hard rock mine in [[North America]] is [[Agnico-Eagle|Agnico-Eagle's]] LaRonde mine, which mines [[gold]], [[zinc]], [[copper]] and [[silver]] [[ore]]s roughly {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Rouyn-Noranda in [[Cadillac, Quebec|Cadillac]], [[Quebec]]. LaRonde's Penna shaft (#3 shaft) is believed to be the deepest single lift shaft in the Western Hemisphere. The new #4 shaft bottoms out at over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} down. Their LaRonde mine expansion sees open stopes down to a depth of over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the deepest longhole open stopes in the world.
* The deepest mine in Europe is the 16th shaft of the uranium mines in [[Příbram]], [[Czech Republic]] at 1,838 meters,&lt;ref name="DeepestEurope"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mineral deposits: from their origin to their environmental impacts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-WkCSk4jbkC&amp;lpg=PA400&amp;ots=mju4Fz3wlJ&amp;dq=uranium%20mines%20in%20P%C5%99%C3%ADbram%201838&amp;hl=cs&amp;pg=PA400#v=onepage&amp;q=uranium%20mines%20in%20P%C5%99%C3%ADbram%201838&amp;f=false |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; second is [[Bergwerk Saar]] in [[Saarland]], [[Germany]] at 1,750 meters.
* The deepest hard rock mines in [[Australia]] are the [[copper]] and [[zinc]] [[lead]] mines in [[Mount Isa, Queensland|Mount Isa]], [[Queensland]] at {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}}.
* The deepest [[platinum]]-[[palladium]] mines in the world are on the [[Merensky Reef]], in [[South Africa]], with a resource of 203 million [[troy ounce]]s, currently worked to approximately {{convert|2200|m|ft|abbr=on}} depth.
* The deepest tourist level mine is [[Guido Mine and Coal Mining Museum]] in [[Zabrze]], [[Poland]].
* The deepest [[borehole]] is [[Kola Superdeep Borehole]] in [[Murmansk Oblast]], [[Russia]]. At 12,262 metres, it is the deepest artificial [[Extreme points of Earth|extreme point of Earth]].  &lt;!--This is not a mine at all, but interesting for comparison--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10880">'''Empathic concern''' refers to other-oriented emotions elicited by and congruent with the perceived welfare of someone in need.&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D. (1991). The altruism question: Toward a social-psychological answer. Hillsdale: Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D. (1987). Prosocial motivation: Is it ever truly altruistic? In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in Experimental Social Psychology (Vol. 20, pp. 65-122). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These other-oriented [[emotions]] include feelings of tenderness, [[sympathy]], [[compassion]], soft-heartedness, and the like. 

Empathic concern is often and wrongly confused with [[empathy]]. To empathize is to respond to another's perceived emotional state by experiencing feeling of a similar sort. Empathic concern or sympathy not only include empathizing, but also entails having a positive regard or a non-fleeting concern for the other person.&lt;ref&gt;Chismar, D. (1988). Empathy and sympathy: the important difference. The Journal of Value Inquiry, 22, 257-266.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[Daniel Batson|C. Daniel Batson]] is one pioneer of the term. His mature definition of the term is "other-oriented emotion elicited by and congruent with the perceived welfare of someone in need".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Batson, C.D. (2011). ''Altruism in Humans'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Batson explains this definition in the following way:

{{Quote|First, "congruent" here refers not to the specific content of the emotion but to the valence&amp;mdash;positive when the perceived welfare of the other is positive, negative when the perceived welfare is negative.&amp;nbsp;... Third, as defined, empathic concern is not a single, discrete emotion but includes a whole constellation. It includes feelings of sympathy, compassion, softheartedness, tenderness, sorrow, sadness, upset, distress, concern, and grief. Fourth, empathic concern is other-oriented in the sense that it involves feeling ''for'' the other&amp;mdash;feeling sympathy for, compassion for, sorry for, distressed for, concerned for, and so on.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;}}

Many writers other than Batson use different terms for this construct or very similar constructs. Especially popular&amp;mdash;perhaps more popular than "empathic concern"&amp;mdash;are ''sympathy'', ''compassion'' or ''pity''.&lt;ref&gt;These are used by numerous philosophers and social scientists including [[Charles Darwin]], [[Frans de Waal]], [[Nancy Eisenberg]], and [[Stephen Darwall]], as documented in Batson's ''Altruism in Humans'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms include ''the tender emotion'' and ''sympathetic distress''.&lt;ref&gt;These latter two terms are due, respectively, to [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] and [[Martin Hoffman]]. See Batson, C.D. (2011). ''Altruism in Humans'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human beings are strongly motivated to be connected to others.&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D. (1990). How social an animal? The human capacity for caring. American Psychologist 45: 336-346.&lt;/ref&gt; In humans and higher mammals, an impulse to care for offspring is almost certainly genetically hard-wired, although modifiable by circumstance.

==Evolutionary origins==
At the behavioral level it is evident from the descriptions of comparative psychologists and ethologists that behaviors homologous to empathic concern can be observed in other [[mammalian]] species. Notably, a variety of reports on ape empathic reactions suggest that, apart from emotional connectedness, [[apes]] have an explicit appreciation of the other's situation.&lt;ref&gt;De Waal, F.B.M. (1996). Good Natured: The origins of right and wrong in humans and other animals. Harvard: Harvard University Press. Harvard: Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt; A good example is consolation, defined as reassurance behavior by an uninvolved bystander towards one of the combatants in a previous aggressive incident.&lt;ref&gt;De Waal, F.B.M., &amp; van Roosmalen, A. (1979). Reconciliation and consolation among chimpanzees. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 5, 55-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental origins==
Empathic concern is thought to emerge later developmental and to require more self-control than either [[emotional contagion]] or [[personal distress]].&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N., &amp; Strayer, J. (1997). Empathy and its Development. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental research indicates a broad range of social competencies children bring to their interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Meyer, M. (2008). From emotion resonance to empathic understanding: A social developmental neuroscience account. Development and Psychopathology, 20, 1053-1080.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 2 years of age, they show (a) the cognitive capacity to interpret, in simple ways, the physical and psychological states of others, (b) the emotional capacity to experience, affectively, the state of others, and (c) the behavioral repertoire that permits the possibility of attempts to alleviate discomfort in others.&lt;ref&gt;Zahn-Waxler, C, Radke-Yarrow, M., Wagner, E., &amp; Chapman, M. (1992). Development of concern for others. Developmental Psychology, 28, 126-136.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both personal disposition such as [[temperament]] and social context contribute to individual differences in concern for others. Some developmental psychologists have hypothesized that empathic concern for others are essential factors inhibiting [[aggression]] toward others.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N., &amp; Eggum, N.D. (2009). Empathic responding: sympathy and personal distress. In: J. Decety and W. Ickes, The Social Neuroscience of Empathy. Cambridge: MIT Press, pp 71-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Hoffman|Hoffman, M.L.]] (2000). Empathy and Moral Development. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution of social psychology==
Empathic concern may produce an [[altruistic]] motivation to reduce the other person's distress.&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D., &amp; Shaw, L.L. (1991). Evidence for altruism: Toward a pluralism of prosocial motives. Psychological Inquiry, 2, 107-122).&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge of demonstrating the existence of altruistic motivation is to show how empathic concern leads to helping in ways that cannot be explained by prevailing theories of egoistic motivation. That is, a clear case needs to be made that it is concern about the other person's welfare, not a desire to improve one's own welfare, that primarily drives one's helping behavior in a particular situation. 

Empirical studies conducted by social psychologist [[Daniel Batson]] have demonstrated that empathic concern is felt when one adopts the perspective of another person in need. His work emphasizes the different emotions evoked when imagining another situation from a self-perspective or imagining from another perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D. (2009). Two forms of perspective taking: imagining how another feels and imagining how you would feel. In K.D. Markman, W.M.P. Klein and J.A. Suhr (Eds.), Handbook of Imagination and Mental Simulation (pp. 267-279). New York: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The former is often associated with [[personal distress]] (i.e., feelings of discomfort and anxiety), whereas the latter leads to empathic concern.

==Social neuroscience evidence==

[[Social neuroscience]] explores the biological underpinnings of empathic concern and more generally interpersonal sensitivity, using an integrative approach that bridges the biological and social levels.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Keenan, J.P. (2006). Social neuroscience: A new journal. Social Neuroscience, 1, 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Neural systems, including autonomic functions, that rely on brain stem [[neuropeptides]], such as [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]], are plausible correlates for empathic concern. Alternatively, vasopressin might be implicated in situations where a more active strategy is required for an effective response.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, C.S., Harris, J., &amp; Porges, S.W. (2009). Neural and evolutionary perspectives on empathy In: J. Decety and W. Ickes, The Social Neuroscience of Empathy. Cambridge: MIT press, pp 169-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

An association between [[executive functions]], underpinned by the [[prefrontal cortex]] with reciprocal connections with the [[limbic system]], the [[sense of agency]], and empathic concern has been suggested based on lesion studies in neurological patients and [[functional neuroimaging]] experiments in healthy individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Jackson, P.L. (2004). The functional architecture of human empathy. Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Reviews, 3, 71-100.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The difference between imaging self versus imaging other is supported by a series of [[functional neuroimaging]] studies of affective processing. For instance, Lamm, Batson and Decety (2007) found that participants reported more empathic concern when imagining the [[pain]] of others when adopting another perspective, and more personal [[suffering|distress]] when imagining themselves to be in pain.&lt;ref&gt;Lamm, C., Batson, C.D., &amp; Decety, J. (2007). The neural substrate of human empathy: effects of perspective-taking and cognitive appraisal. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 19, 42-58.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The fMRI scans revealed that imagining self in pain was associated with strong activation in brain areas involved in affective response to threat and pain, including the amygdala, insula and anterior cingulate cortex. Imagine-other instructions produced higher activity in the right temporoparietal junction (or TPJ), which is associated with self-other distinctiveness and the sense of agency.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4146">'''Entosis''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἐντός ''entos'', "within" and -ωσις ''-osis'', "disease") is the invasion of a living cell into another cell's cytoplasm.&lt;ref name="Janssen 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janssen|first=Aniek|author2=Rene H. Medema|title=Entosis: aneuploidy by invasion|journal=Nature Cell Biology|date=1 March 2011|volume=13|pages=199–201|doi=10.1038/ncb0311-199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was discovered by Overholtzer, et al. as reported in ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]''.&lt;ref name="Overholtzer 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Overholtzer|first=Michael|author2=Arnaud A. Mailleux |author3=Ghassan Mouneimne |author4=Guillaume Normand |author5=Stuart J. Schnitt |author6=Randall W. King |author7=Edmund S. Cibas |author8=Joan S. Brugge |title=A Nonapoptotic Cell Death Process, Entosis, that Occurs by Cell-in-Cell Invasion|journal=Cell|date=30 November 2007|volume=131|issue=5|pages=966–979|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.10.040 |pmid=18045538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entotic cells, also referred to as cell-in-cell structures, are triggered by loss of attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM). This internalization of one cell by another is dependent on adherens junctions, and is driven by a Rho-dependent process, involving actin polymerization and myosin II activity in the internalized cell.&lt;ref name="Overholtzer 2007" /&gt; Adherens junctions bind cells together by linking cadherin transmembrane protein complexes of adjacent cells to the cytoskeleton. When certain cell types are detached from the ECM and have lost adhesion, the compaction force between neighboring cells can cause them to push into their neighbors, forming the trademark cell-in-cell structures.&lt;ref name="Memorial 2009" /&gt; Though cell-in-cell structures commonly refer to the interaction between two neighboring cells, entosis has been observed involving more than two cells. In the case of an entotic structure formed between three cells, the middle cell acts as both an internalizing and an outer host cell simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Memorial 2009"&gt;{{cite web|last=Overholtzer|first=Michael|title=An Interview with Michael Overholtzer|url=http://www.mskcc.org/research/lab/michael-overholtzer/interview-michael-overholtzer|publisher=Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center|accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aneuploidy, a condition in which non-disjunction gives rise to gametes with an abnormal number of chromosomes,&lt;ref name="Alberts 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alberts|first=Bruce|title=Essential Cell Biology, 3rd Ed|year=2010|publisher=Garland Science, Taylor &amp; Franis Group, LLC|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-8153-4129-1|pages=662–663}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the most prevalent phenotypes of human tumors. The underlying cause of aneuploidy remains highly debated; however, entosis is shown to perturb cytokinesis (cytoplasmic division) and trigger the formation of aneuploid cells.&lt;ref name="Janssen 2011" /&gt; This would be in line with past research, as cell-in-cell structures have been widely observed in the focused study of many human tumors, including lung, breast, and endometrial stromal carcinomas.&lt;ref name="Overholtzer 2007" /&gt;

A cell trapped by entosis is initially alive and can divide inside the cell that has enveloped it. On occasion, the entotic cell will be released by the host cell, but most internalized cells are eventually killed.&lt;ref name="Memorial 2009" /&gt; Normal cells can kill themselves via apoptosis, involving the programmed engulfment and phagocytic ingestion of a cell by another. Entosis differs greatly from apoptosis in that the entotic process exhibits behavior closely resembling cellular invasion rather than cellular engulfment.&lt;ref name="Overholtzer 2007" /&gt;  Cancer cells adaptively avoid apoptosis, allowing them to live and multiply indefinitely, making it difficult to design drugs that effectively kill tumors. Therefore, entosis acts as a nonapoptotic cell death mechanism, and could possibly be a new way in which cancer cells can be killed.&lt;ref name="Memorial 2009" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3664">'''Epiphytic bacteria''' are [[bacteria]] which live non-parasitically on the surface of a plant on various organs such as the leaves, roots, flowers, buds, seeds and fruit. In current studies it has been determined that epiphytic bacteria generally don’t harm the plant, but promote the formation of ice crystals. Some produce an auxin hormone which promotes plant growth and plays a role in the life cycle of the bacteria. 

Different bacteria prefer different plants and different plant organs depending on the organ's nutritional content, and depending on the bacteria's colonization system which is controlled by the host plant. Bacteria which live on leaves are referred to as [[phyllobacteria]], and bacteria which live on the root system are referred to as [[rhizabacteria]]. They adhere to the plant surface forms as 1-cluster 2- individual bacterial cell  3- biofilm  .&lt;ref&gt;Samuel S. Gnanamanickam,   J. Ebenezar Immanuel  .Epiphytic bacteria, their ecology and functions&lt;/ref&gt; The age of the organ also affects the epiphytic bacteria population and characteristics and has a role in the inhibition of [[phytopathogen]] on plant.

==Classification==
Many epiphytic bacteria are rod-shaped, and classified as either gram negative or gram positive, pigmented or non-pigmented, fermentative or non-fermentative  .

Non-pigmented epiphytic bacteria have high a GC content in their [[genome]], a characteristic which protects the bacteria from the [[ultraviolet]] rays of the sun. Because of this, these bacteria have special nutritional requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Fenella Mary War Nongkhlaw, S.R. Joshi . 2014.

'''Forensic materials engineering''', a branch of [[forensic engineering]], focuses on the material evidence from crime or accident scenes, seeking  defects in those materials which might explain why an accident occurred, or the source of a specific material to identify a criminal. Many analytical methods used for material identification may be used in investigations, the exact set being determined by the nature of the material in question, be it [[metal]], [[glass]], [[ceramic]], [[polymer]] or [[composite material|composite]]. An important aspect is the analysis of [[trace evidence]] such as [[skid mark]]s on exposed surfaces, where contact between dissimilar materials leaves material traces of one left on the other. Provided the traces can be analysed successfully, then an accident or crime can often be reconstructed. Another aim will be to determine the cause of a broken component using the technique of [[fractography]].

==Metals and alloys==
[[Image:Crankshaft fatigue.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|[[Crankshaft]] [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] fracture]]
Metal and alloy surfaces can be analyzed in a number of ways, including by [[spectroscopy]] and [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|EDX]] used during [[scanning electron microscopy]]. The nature and composition of the metal can normally be established by sectioning and polishing the bulk, and examining the flat section using [[optical microscopy]] after [[etching]] solutions have been used to provide contrast in the section between alloy constituents. Such solutions (often an [[acid]]) attack the surface preferentially, so isolating features or inclusions of one composition, enabling them to be seen much more clearly than in the polished but untreated surface. [[Metallography]] is a routine technique for examining the [[microstructure]] of metals, but can also be applied to ceramics, glasses and polymers. [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] can often be critical in  determining failures modes by examining fracture surfaces. The origin of a crack can be found and the way it grew assessed, to distinguish, for example, [[Mechanical overload (engineering)|overload]] failure from [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]]. Often however, fatigue fractures are easy to distinguish from overload failures by the lack of ductility, and the existence of a fast crack growth region and the slow crack growth area on the fracture surface. [[Crankshaft]] fatigue for example is a common failure mode for engine parts. The example shows just two such zones, the slow crack at the base, the fast at the top.

==Ceramics and glasses==
[[Image:Glass fracture.jpg|left|thumb|200px| Brittle fracture in [[glass]]]]
Hard products like [[ceramic]] pottery and [[glass]] [[windscreen]]s can be studied using the same [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] methods used for metals, especially [[ESEM]] conducted at low vacuum. Fracture surfaces are especially valuable sources of information because surface features like hachures can enable the origin or origins of the cracks to be found. Analysis of the surface features is carried out using [[fractography]].

The position of the origin can then be matched with likely loads on the product to show how an accident occurred, for example. Inspection of bullet holes can often show the direction of travel and energy of the impact, and the way common glass products like bottles can be analysed to show whether deliberately or accidentally broken in a crime or accident. Defects such as foreign particles will often occur near or at the origin of the critical crack, and can be readily identified by [[ESEM]].

==Polymers and composites==
[[Image:Chlorine attack1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[chlorine]] attack of [[acetal resin]] plumbing joint]]
[[Thermoplastics]], [[thermosets]], and [[Composite material|composites]] can be analyzed using [[FTIR]] and [[UV spectroscopy]] as well as [[NMR]] and [[ESEM]]. Failed samples can either be dissolved in a suitable solvent and examined directly (UV, IR and NMR sepctroscopy) or as a thin film cast from solvent or cut using [[microtomy]] from the solid product. The slicing method is preferable since there are no complications from solvent absorption, and the integrity of the sample is partly preserved. Fractured products can be examined using [[fractography]], an especially useful method for all fractured components using [[macrophotography]] and [[optical microscopy]]. Although polymers usually possess quite different properties to metals and ceramics, they are just as susceptible to failure from [[mechanical overload (engineering)|mechanical overload]], [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] and [[stress corrosion cracking]] if products are poorly designed or manufactured. Many plastics are susceptible to attack by active chemicals like [[chlorine]], present at low levels in potable water supplies, especially if the [[injection moulding]]s are faulty.

[[ESEM]] is especially useful for providing [[elemental analysis]] from viewed parts of the sample being investigated. It is effectively a technique of [[microanalysis]] and valuable for examination of [[trace evidence]]. On the other hand, colour rendition is absent, and there is no information provided about the way in which those elements are bonded to one another. Specimens will be exposed to a vacuum, so any volatiles may be removed, and surfaces may be contaminated by substances used to attach the sample to the mount.

==Elastomers==
[[Image:Ozone cracks in tube1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ozone cracking in [[Natural rubber]] tubing]]
Rubber products are often safety-critical parts of machines, so that failure can often cause accidents or loss of function. Failed products can be examined with many of the generic polymer methods, although it is more difficult if the sample is [[vulcanized]] or [[cross-linked]]. [[Attenuated total reflectance]] [[infra-red spectroscopy]] is useful because the product is usually flexible so can be pressed against the [[selenium]] crystal used for analysis. Simple swelling tests can also help to identify the specific [[elastomer]] used in a product. Often the best technique is [[ESEM]] using the X-ray elemental analysis facility on the microscope. Although the method only provides [[elemental analysis]], it can provide clues as to the identity of the elastomer being examined. Thus the presence of substantial amounts of [[chlorine]] indicates [[polychloroprene]] while the presence of [[nitrogen]] indicates [[nitrile rubber]]. The method is also useful in confirming [[ozone cracking]] by the large amounts of [[oxygen]] present on cracked surfaces. Ozone attacks susceptible elastomers such as [[natural rubber]], [[nitrile rubber]] and [[polybutadiene]] and associated [[copolymer]]s. Such elastomers possess double bonds in their main chains, the group which is attacked during [[ozonolysis]].

The problem occurs when small concentrations of [[ozone]] gas are present near to exposed elastomer surfaces, such as [[O-ring]]s and [[diaphragm seal]]s. The product must be in tension, but only very low strains are sufficient to cause degradation.

[[File:Gmp logo.png|thumb|Global Marshall Plan Initiative Logo]]
The '''Global Marshall Plan Initiative''' views itself as an integrative organizational platform for a "world in balance". Composed of a network of more than 5000 supporters from all levels of society, brought together from politics, economics and [[civil society]], the Initiative is based on five core goals for fair [[globalization]]. Through its network-like character, it is organized through even hierarchies and without a centre. Everyone is invited to actively participate and take action with their circles and the accompanying opportunities to implement a World in Balance!

The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to establish a framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy – a global Eco-Social Market Economy.

== Origins  ==
[[File:Al Gore, Vice President of the United States, official portrait 1994.jpg|thumb|Al Gore - Author of "Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit"]]
The idea of a [[Global Marshall Plan]] was first published in 1990 by U.S. politician, entrepreneur and environmentalist [[Al Gore]] in his book “Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit”. The choice of name deliberately recalls the historical [[Marshall Plan]] after the Second World War (officially: European Recovery Program), a symbol for [[hope]], [[solidarity]] and [[peace]].

The idea of a Global Marshall Plan was not new but had already been endorsed in the 1990s by personalities from a variety of sectors: [[Kofi Annan]], [[Al Gore]], [[Hans Küng]], [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]], Mikhail Gorbachov, His Royal Highness Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, [[George Soros]], Lutz Wicke, [[Georg Winter (manager)|Georg Winter]] and many others (Global Contract). As early as the beginning of the 1990s an ecological Marshall Plan was established by prominent personalities such as journalist Franz Alt and German Green politician Joscka Fisher. Along with many other supporters, they called for the establishment of an eco-social market economy, 100 billion DM put towards the environment every year and a Kerosin tax.

As the world increasingly finds itself in a difficult, unsustainable situation as a result of rapid globalization, both in terms of environmental issues, [[poverty]] and unequal distribution, as well as the disproportionate cultural balance, on 16 May 2003 representatives from 16 [[civil society]] organizations revived the original idea for a global Marshall Plan as a movement for [[world peace]], [[sustainability]] and [[justice]], and at the Frankfurt airport, the Global Marshall Plan initiative was launched. Since the initiative should be organized as a network, i.e. locally and without hierarchies, the coordination of tasks and activities was assigned to different people and institutions: the coordination of content was taken up by Prof. Dr. Franz-Josef Radermacher as Head of FAW/n, politicians, and Josef Riegler, with particular importance on an EU level and the Eco-Social Forum Europe. The coordination, initiation and promotion of supporters’ activities internationally were assigned the Global Contract Foundation and Frithjof Finkbeiner. Due to the enormous positive response and the wide range of activities, this commission was soon transferred to the Global Marshall Plan Foundation.

The long-term goal of the initiative is to establish a global eco-social market economy and alter the current failing global framework to lead to long-lasting peace and [[sustainability]]. From the beginning, the founders set themselves the goal to develop the initiative as openly as possible and also to win over the support of the economy. All actors and parts of the global society should find that in the Global Marshall Plan one-sided organization can constructively be prevented. The initiative aims to provide the great possible support to the world to ensure that plan is continually developed in its substance, quality, implementation and coverage.

In a series of lectures in 2003-4, the initiative was refined further and eventually the first report on the Global Marshall Plan Initiative (“Global Marshall Plan – A Planetary Contract for a global Eco-Social Market Economy) was compiled to be published in September 2004.

In the meantime, more and more members of the [[European Parliament]] and national parliaments began to back the initiative. Soon organizations from the civil society and the economy followed, as well as the first university. The initiative was also received very well internationally. The initiative has grown into a network made up of over 5000 individual supporters, organizations as well as numerous federal states and communities.

Believing that change will come from the centre of society, supporters raise awareness of the issues surrounding globalization and motivate those around them for the implementation of fair globalization. Lectures are an essential part of spreading the word. By raising awareness and informing, alliances are formed and pressure is created from “[[Business development|bottom-up]]”. Those motivated are trained through multiplier training in Global Marshall Plan Academies.

== Self-understanding ==
Material prosperity of mankind has never before experienced such an increase. Nevertheless poverty, deprivation and the resulting illnesses are still alarmingly widespread. The increasing overexploitation of nature, wasted limited [[resources]] and expected catastrophic climate consequences linked to [[pollution]] will present mankind in the next 30 years with their biggest challenge yet.

Unsustainable consumption of developing countries, poverty and [[population growth]] are among the key problems. Many hundreds of millions of people do not benefit from the positive effects of ongoing globalization, which has further increased the income gap between rich industrial nations and the poorest developing countries. The spread of [[AIDS]] and looming population growth also accelerate this.

Any effort to overcome this unsustainable development will be four times more difficult in the future, or even impossible, if a fundamental turnaround is not set in place soon.

The Global Marshall Plan Initiative wants to strengthen these turnarounds. With the self-understanding of a network-style movement for a World in Balance, positively aligned powers from politics, economics, science and civil society are brought together in a wide alliance based on the key requirements of fair globalization. This relies on the simultaneous pursuit of “bottom-up” and “top-down” approach, thus raising awareness and lobbying.

Through lectures, information events and publications, more people and groups are continually informed about the absolute necessity and the possibility of a global Eco-Social framework, so that political change comes from the centre of society. At the same time, support for the Global Marshall Plan and a global Eco-Social Market Economy is acquired from national, European and international decision makers through a direct approach.

== Goals  ==
The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to make a substantial contribution to a global eco-social market economy. This eco-social Marshall Plan would include realistic perspectives:

* to overcome the degrading poverty of half of mankind, which long has been identified as chief cause of the existing world problems
* to successfully establish global ecological and social standards for a [[sustainable development]]
* to overcome the deep cultural frustration and humiliation experienced by the majority of the world’s civilization and at the same time to eliminate the explosive environment that generates international [[terrorism]] and endangers global security
* for a new economic miracle which specifically boosts the human potential of more than three billion people (which until now has been laying absolutely idle). This would ultimately bring use to the whole human race
* to create fair globalisation
* and to accomplish [[human rights]] and human dignity for everyone.

According to the initiative, a Global Marshall Plan could also allow attractive new perspectives for many other problems caused by an unbalanced globalization. Possible impacts for example could be:

* The wealth and therefore the wages would increase in developing countries, so that the wage pressure in the economies of traditional industrialised countries will drop. The increased demand on the worlds market would also then contribute to a heightened job security in industrialised countries.
* An implementation of ecological goals would be far more realistic than is currently the case, since because poverty is, as the argument goes, one of the reasons for environmental damages in the poorest countries. Who would fight for daily survival, will be hardly convinced of environmental protection. In most parts of the world the implementation of ecological goals can only be realistic when they are directly linked to active promotion of social and ecological development.
* The model of an open, peaceful, democratic, constitutional and educated civil society, which many see as best guarantee for a good and dynamic future perspective, would be brought forward by the eco-social Marshall Plan.

The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to globally link appropriate order processes with competitive mechanisms to create value added systems by combining potential, resources and [[infrastructure]] with well planned, institutional solutions. A global eco-social market economy would therefore create the right balance between competitive economy, social solidarity and ecological sustainability.

== The logic of the plan ==
Central to the logic of a plan is the following basic principle, as introduced by the Global Marshall Plan Initiative:

[[Investments]], coordinated market openings and co-financing provide the harmonization that results in social and ecological standards. A form of targeted global overcoming of poverty should therefore emerge that will release especially strong new economic stimuli for the regions concerned, as well as for the whole global economy. By combining new growth with clear ecological standards at the same time a strong environmental approach to economic activities should be encouraged.

According to initiative, the new economic, ecological and social perspectives would have a strong impulse for the inner peace of the global community, which in turn is important for a lasting and sustained growth of economy.

It is also assumed that the positive effects of a Global Marshall Plan would also consequently increase the pull on governments, who so far have been averse to the eco-social movement. It would reinforce the pressure on these governments to give space for these developments, to reduce corruption and boost [[Good Governance]]. Good Governance signifies a well working guidance and control system of a political social unit as a state or a community. The principles often include terms such as transparency, efficiency, participation, responsibility, constitutional state, democracy and justice often belong to the principles.

Especially important is that the Global Marshall Plan overcomes old clashes of interests and that it achieves an unusually wide support.

One of the surprising intermediate results of the present process is that it is supported by commercial and industrial enterprises and their federations as well as severe critics of the previous form of globalisation and representatives from the “North” and “South”. Several well known representatives of all main political movements, all civil sectors and global acting networks of civil society argued vehemently for the initiative. The existing approaches and ideas of the initiative could open is a real prospect to bridge the wide social gap.

== Key requirements for a world in balance ==
Elements of the Global Marshall Plan, including the five interrelated building blocks of the plan, have already been mentioned in previous UN summits, European policy and demands from various [[NGO]]s and institutions. The five building blocks, which are continually adapted to the current challenges, form the starting point and at the same time the foundation of the initiative.

=== Further development and implementation of the UN Millennium Development Goals ===
In September 2000 the [[United Nations]] (UN) came together at the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] to discuss the most important challenges in the coming decade. In the final [[Millennium Declaration]], globalization was highlighted as one of the most important current issues.

In this declaration, the 192 [[UN member states]] committed themselves to the concrete [[Millennium Development Goals]], which should help to ensure everyone benefits from globalization.

The UN Millennium Development Goals represent the beliefs of the initiative – the first intermediate step towards fair world order and to sustainable development. It is unlikely that the goals will be achieved by 2015. Many problems have even worsened, highlighting a glaring failure of the international community. If anything, this should be all the more incentive to updates the goals and meet them promptly.

=== Achieving the 0.7% target and raising an additional necessary funds ===
A series of appropriate and necessary declarations and agreements (such as the above-mentioned Millennium Development Goals) have been only previously implemented to an extremely discouraging extent. If the apparent gap between declaration of intent and ability to act is not soon overcome, we are threatened with an escalation of global problems. Especially worrying is the looming crisis of confidence in decision-making processes on all levels and inability to enact policies in general.

The phase of understanding must therefore immediately be followed by a phase of decisive implementation. This involves not only the delivery mechanism (see 5.4) but also all questions of financing.

The financial means needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals lies, after an analysis from the UNO, at around US$50 billion per year plus some $20 billion for the provision of public goods and humanitarian missions. Considering the current situation significantly more resources are needed for development aid and the implementation of the MDGs. By enforcing the 0.7% GNP target, which the United Nations has been aiming at for decades, the means to finance [[development aid]] would be available.

In comparison:

The percentage volume of the US Marshall Plan after the Second World War was 1.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) of the USA – over a time period of 4 years.
 
Global military spending in 2004 amounted to around $1000 billion excluding the cost for the Iraq War. The Iraq War has already cost an additional several hundred billion US dollars.

These numbers illustrate that the proposed Global Marshall Plan on the stated level is by all means financeable.

=== Fair taxation on the global value-added processes ===
As well as market openings and new delivery mechanisms, global development also requires the above-mentioned financial means for international cooperation. Despite the principal way of using national budgets to provide the necessary funds, it would be easier, from a fundamental and procedural point of view, to find another way to allocate these funds.

On the one hand, national budgets are not directly charged, but on the other hand, the generated funds could be better separated from the national interests of donating countries, and it is easier to move forward together when everyone moves at the same pace. Since in the past self-contained national interests have repeatedly affected the efficiency of measures for development cooperation and consequently the public reputation of such programs has significantly decreased. An improvement in finding new means of financing could prove critical both politically as well as for the public acceptance of a Global Marshall Plan.

Therefore, the initiative urges that for regulatory reasons, due to improved governance action, for increased transparency, and in particular for better controls on the world finance sectors, tax on global value-added processes and the use of Global Commons must be systematically established. Examples of these include a global [[financial transactions tax]], the trade with CO2 emissions allowances in context of [[climate justice]] and a kerosene tax. The following are some examples:

==== Financial transactions tax ====
Another proposal to finance a Global Marshall Plan, which also has support from numerous experts, is a tax on global financial transactions. The [[financial transaction tax]] (FTT) is currently on the verge of a breakthrough in the [[European Union|EU]].

Critics of this idea are concerned that as a result of the tax, the “[[collective intelligence]]” in control of highly sensitive financial flows would be charged. On the contrary, in the recent excesses and “bubbles” of international capital, financial markets and the [[New Economy]], this intelligence has proved to be not all that far reaching. However it is in any case only a cautious use of these instruments and this suggested only on a global level.

A cautious start could be, for example, a global financial transaction tax of initially 0.01% If this proves to be positive, the value could be increased to 0.02%. With this, $30–40 billion could be raised each year.

However it must be acknowledged that such a global tax would require the establishment of new international structures that would possess the necessary authority as well as the effective sanctions.

==== Other considerations ====
In addition to the two presented financing options, the establishment of a Global Climate Certificate System (GCCS), a Future Bond, an [[International Finance Facility]] and a Kerosene Tax are also being discussed.

Other important considerations include the debt of development countries, closing offshore tax havens, which deprive national tax systems of some $50 billion every year, dismantling protectionist structures as well as discussions on an international cartel authority.

=== Fair, global partnerships and effective appropriation of funds ===
A fair partnership in development assistance on all levels and an adequate cash flow are the requirements for a sustainable future perspective for the entire world. Promoting Good Governance, subsidiaries, rationality, education, combating corruption, as well as an appropriation of funds, coordinated and directed at a grass-roots level, are considered crucial for self-regulated development (e.g. micro-financing).

To be able to develop the desired effect and gain broad and sustained support of global civil society but also to find the economy and politics, earlier mistakes in development cooperation must be avoided in the implementation of the Global Marshall Plan.

The overcoming of global [[market fundamentalism]] and the realization of a global eco-social market economy should be made possible by establishing a better framework for the global economy in a fair global agreement. The most appropriate way appears to primarily be the relationship between ethic, economic, ecological, social, cultural and democratic standards with such a programme.

The standards and codes of practice are related to (co)financing programmes. The allocation of funds must not be influenced through short-term economic interests of rich countries or through short-term power interests of elites in poor countries. This can best be achieved through a consistent focus on the mentioned standards, an associated accountability, an active and transparent involvement of industry and the organisation of civil society.

The first phase of the Global Marshall Plan seeks for the application of the following standards which have already been agreed on by UN member states:

Basic economic, social and cultural human rights, which are largely congruent with the core standards of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), such as organisational rights, [[gender equality]], prohibition of [[child labour]] etc.

Standards of international environmental and conservation agreements such as the Convention on Bio-diversity, [[CITES]] (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or the Washington Convention) and the [[Kyoto Protocol]].
 
Ignoring some of these standards represents, in many areas, the most important competitive economic advantages for less developed countries. The example of EU enlargement shows however that agreements on the application of common high standards and protection levels can be achieved, if accompanied by a co-financing of the development of weaker partners by developed countries is ensured. This coupling is profitable for all involved.

Previously the most effective ways of enforcing standards on a global level were held by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). However the organisation has received criticism like hardly any other. This is mainly because, in accordance with their mandate, they primarily promote the reduction of trade barriers and in doing so, discounts ecological, social and cultural aspects.

In the long-term, however, the WTO could still be reformed into a sustainable institution with trade regulations associated with the above-mentioned standards towards a fair, balanced and sustainability-oriented economic system. This should provide all elements of the prospective framework for non-compliance with the same legal action and sanction options. The equality of trade, environmental and social standards through a link with the WTO is one of the central concerns of the initiative.

Alternative considerations concerning the enforceability of ecological and social standards focus on strengthening a reformed UN and more efficient means of enforcing social standards within the ILO or human rights.

Every level, from the individual and local, to the national and global, has its own, essential function in a globalised world. One accomplishment of the tasks according to the principle of subsidiarity (principle that states matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest or least centralized competent authority) is essential for an efficient implementation of a Global Marshall Plan and requires a lot of changes, since the political decision-making structures of today are still far from fulfilling the needs of the growing world society.

Knowledge transfers, empowerment, investments directed at education and health must be central to the effort. Important aspects to achieve a reasonable regulatory framework and a self-regulated development include:

* Fair cooperation based on partnerships on all levels
* Strengthening of decision-making and organisation opportunities for partner countries
* Promoting Good Governance and fighting corruption
* Appropriation of funds, coordinated and directed at a grass-roots level, e.g. micro-credit
* and adequate funding

The ideology that the luck is on the side of the fittest, thus essentially stating that poverty is caused by itself, dismisses the many dimensions of poverty and neglects its causes which lie not finally in the unequal property and power structures that have maintained poverty and dependence for centuries.

A worldwide expansion of “Western” development and suppressing our unsustainable, undesirable development does not lead to worldwide wealth in any way, but to cultural impoverishment as well as the destruction of our natural resources.

==== From development aid to development cooperation ====
The arrogance of the Western civilisation, which is perceived by people as humiliating, degrading and threatening, provokes anti-Western sentiment and provides the breeding ground for hate and violence. There are also unfairly distributed opportunities and a lack of balance of interests.

Combating the misery in the world is not just a handout, but humanitarian duty and peace policy is also in our best interests. These days widespread human security can not be achieved when we’re against one another, only when we’re with one another. In addition it is necessary to build mutual trust, to accept those in disadvantaged countries as equal partners and to allow contributions from international negotiation and decision-making processes.

==== Application of funds ====
Given the above considerations, the Global Marshall Plan Initiative sees the following principles and suggestions for the application of funds as particularly noteworthy:

* The specific development programmes should be coordinated by the appropriated specialized organisations and programmes of the United Nations. The role of the United Nations must be strengthened.
* The example of the already established financing organisation “[[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]]” should be observed to see whether establishing such financing organisation in the UN’s own interaction with the economy and civil society is helpful to the key objectives of the Global Marshall Plan.
* Provided that funds are acquired from world trade tax, it would be worth considering investing this initially into development goals in every economic sector so that income accumulated in these sectors would increase agreement from the economy.
* An essential tool in the application of funds should be the public tender of proposed programmes from NGOs to maintain the best cost-income ratio in healthier competition.
* Projects should have clear priority, which are based on entrepreneurial potential of local people – for example small credit banks and development schools where locals are trained by aid workers.
* In technology transfers, the choice of promoted projects should be orientated above all towards those that teach largest possible number of locals the skills, so they are able to cope on their own as quickly and efficiently as possible.

The search for particularly successful, socially efficient and ecological projects and those success criteria should be defined and promoted as new international research priority. In this way the efficiency of many current forms of development assistance could be substantially increased.

=== Framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy: a global Eco-Social Market Economy ===
With the gradual implementation of a global Eco-Social Market Economy, a framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy will be established and the global market fundamentalism will be overcome. Functioning Global Governance structures need to reform existing institutions and policies (e.g. United Nations, World Trade Organization and World Finance Sector), as well as their coherent linkup to create a functioning whole.

== Next stages ==
Currently the initiative for a Global Marshall Plan is supported by more than 5000 individuals, 200 organisations, all Austrian federal states as well as some German states and prominent public figures. In many European and non-European countries the first national and regional structures have been established. From the 19–20 April 2008 representatives from numerous local and regional groups from Germany met in Erfurt to discuss establishing a national initiative with the purpose of a new governance structure of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative. As a result, an Erfurt Declaration was accepted, which expresses the will to establish an umbrella organisation to house the local, regional and national groups. As to not contract initiative’s own understanding of its network-like character and open design, the establishment of a national organisation has recently been abandoned. People can belong to numerous organisations, get involved in local groups informally or organize a club. There should not be a national organisation or governing body.

As an international initiative, the goals are strategic: implementing a Global Marshall Plan and developing a broad public awareness of globally responsible action. Only an increased awareness and an improved understanding can be a reliable basis to lead the initiative to become better known and to create fairer globalization.

The Global Marshall Plan Initiative addresses this with their ideas and suggestions aimed at different audiences:

* To all people in the world to contribute to the initiative with their knowledge, experiences and ideas
* To religious organisations as well as the media and artists to spread the ideas of the Global Marshall plan and create awareness
* To interested groups as well as in NGO organised civil societies. The goal is to join forces and fight for a fair, sustainable globalization together.
* To science. All disciplines are invited to help to develop the Global Marshall Plan with detailed and interdisciplinary established projects.
* To the economy to make the Global Marshall Plan one its own concerns to create a socially fair and ecologically responsible economic development
* To governments and parliaments of nation states to officially support the Global Marshall Plan and to develop it through discussion with other actors. This new quality of global action and problem-solving ability lies in the long-term interests of all countries.
* To the [[European Union]] as an important bearer of hope for the project and for many people in the entire world. The EU member states are faced with the historical opportunity to make the transition from former colonial powers to partners of efficient and comprehensively understood development policies. The EU can and should courageously develop an alternative to current forms of globalisation and consistently advocate them in international negotiations.
* To the UN and its programmes and specialized organisations that play a central role in the implementation of these projects. Initiatives to reform the UN in the direction of greater efficiency, competency and funding are supported by the initiative.
* To the [[G8]] to place combating poverty not as short-term measures such as aid and debt relief in the foreground, but to fight structural poverty through a reform of global regulations and institution at their roots.

Shortly after establishing the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, Karolin and Frithjof Finkbeiner founded the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. From them on, the foundation took over from the duties originally assigned to the Global Contract Foundation of an international coordination office of the initiative. Since the foundation has acted as secretariat for the initiative, taking care of the proper application of logos, networking actors and promoting many innovative projects with the help of numerous supporters. Alongside the support of the children’s initiative [[Plant-for-the-Planet]], which is active in more than 193 countries, it is possible to organize more international conferences, as for example the Commons Forum, and train around 40 participants through the multiplier training of the Global Marshall Plan Academy that take places yearly.

Some of the more than 200 organizations that support the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, set up a coordination circle for the initiative in December 2010 in Munich and took over the political and content related duties that had until then been shared out between others. The coordination circle develops strategic and content positions of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, decides which projects to support, works on further development of content and is responsible for the yearly initiative meeting. Since November 2011 members have busied themselves with the development of a list of demands for the financial crisis. The current paper can be downloaded from the initiative’s website.

The current projects of the initiative are the University Days: Eco-Social Market Economy and Sustainability, a collaborative project between the initiative and 5 other organizations, as well as other multiplier training through the internationalisation and offer of other formats within the Global Marshall Plan Academy. Both projects are supported by the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. The foundation of one of three project offices finances the University Days, for the Global Marshall Plan the organizational administration. The support and maintenance of local activities through the coordination office, the coordination and communication of speakers and lecturers are additional important component of the commitment of the initiative.

=== Supporters ===
Supporters of the initiative include [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]], Hubert Weinzierl (BUND), [[Rita Süssmuth]], Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker, Franz Josef Radermacher, [[Jakob von Uexküll]], Ulrich Martin Drescher, Renée Ernst, [[Sandra Maischberger]] (all from Germany), Josef Riegler, [[Franz Fischler]] (Austria), Prince El Hassan bin Talal (Jordan), [[Vandana Shiva]] (India), [[Jane Goodall]] (UK) and approximately 5000 supporters from Germany and Austria.

The supporting organisations include the [[Club of Rome]], the Eco-Social Europe, the German Federal Association of Economic Development and Foreign Economic Affairs, [[AIESEC]] Germany and Austria, Cap Anamur/German Emergency Doctors, [[VENRO]] (umbrella organisation of development non-governmental organisations), UN Millennium Campaign Germany as well as all the federal states of Austria.

In January 2007 the state parliament of Thuringia became the first national parliament in Germany to commit the goals of the Global Marshall Plan. The parliament paper (Parliament paper 4/2658) also requested the Thuringia state government to support the development of a concrete package of measures for the implementation of the Global Marshall Plan and to raise awareness with prominent example projects and information events in Thuringia as well reporting on progress every three years in state parliament. Since November 2007 the city of Munich has also supported the Global Marshall Plan.

An up-to-date list of supports can be found on the Global Marshall Plan website.

== On a local level ==
Since Spring 2004, a year after the initiative was founded, the local and university groups were founded by supporters in numerous places. The members of these groups stand together for a World in Balance to support the goal of a fairer world. Again and again new like-minded people are brought together by getting involved in their area.

The members of predominantly German-speaking areas (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) as well as international operating local groups and individual contact points operate projects for raising awareness. Through bottom-up activities, supporters clear up to those around them topics such as the [[climate crisis]], global poverty and other inequalities to contribute actively towards the necessary changes. With the active announcement of the Global Marshall Plan the supporters understand as lobbying for the common goal – a World in Balance – and act from the centre of society, pressurizing politics and the economy.

The Global Marshall Plan University Group was brought to life in 2004 as the first local group. They already organised series of lectures with personalities such as nobel prize winner [[Muhammad Yunus]] and was an incentive and model for other local groups. Currently there are more than 33 contact points worldwide, 23 of which are in German speaking countries acting locally.

'''Green engineering''' approaches the design of products and processes by applying financially and technologically feasible processes and products in a manner that simultaneously decreases the amount of [[pollution]] that is generated by a source, minimizes exposures to potential hazards (including reducing [[toxicity]] and improved uses of matter and energy throughout the life cycle of the product and processes) as well as protecting human health without relinquishing the economic efficiency and viability.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2014), Green Engineering. http://www.epa.gov/oppt/greenengineering/&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, green engineering is not actually an [[engineering]] discipline in itself, but an overarching engineering framework for all design disciplines.

== Principles==
Green engineering adheres to nine guiding principles. A designer must strive to:

#Engineer processes and products holistically, use systems analysis, and integrate environmental impact assessment tools.
#Conserve and improve natural ecosystems while protecting human health and well-being.
#Use life-cycle thinking in all engineering activities.
#Ensure that all material and energy inputs and outputs are as inherently safe and benign as possible.
#Minimize depletion of natural resources.
#Strive to prevent waste.
#Develop and apply engineering solutions, while being cognizant of local geography, aspirations, and cultures.
#Create engineering solutions beyond current or dominant technologies; improve, innovate, and invent (technologies) to achieve [[sustainability]].
#Actively engage communities and stakeholders in development of engineering solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Green Engineering: Defining the Principles Conference, Sandestin, Florida, May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.T. Anastas and J.B. Zimmerman (2003). Design through the Twelve Principles of Green Engineering. Env. Sci. and Tech., 37, 5, 94A-101A. &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Chemical Society]] has expanded these to twelve principles:

# Inherent Rather Than Circumstantial – Designers need to strive to ensure that all materials and energy inputs and outputs are as inherently nonhazardous as possible.
# Prevention Instead of Treatment – It is better to prevent waste than to treat or clean up waste after it is formed.
# Design for Separation – Separation and purification operations should be designed to minimize energy consumption and materials use.
# Maximize Efficiency – Products, processes, and systems should be designed to maximize mass, energy, space, and time efficiency.
# Output-Pulled Versus Input-Pushed – Products, processes, and systems should be "output pulled" rather than "input pushed" through the use of energy and materials.
# Conserve Complexity – Embedded entropy and complexity must be viewed as an investment when making design choices on recycle, reuse, or beneficial disposition.
# Durability Rather Than Immortality – Targeted durability, not immortality, should be a design goal.
# Meet Need, Minimize Excess – Design for unnecessary capacity or capability (e.g., "one size fits all") solutions should be considered a design flaw.
# Minimize Material Diversity – Material diversity in multicomponent products should be minimized to promote disassembly and value retention.
# Integrate Material and Energy Flows – Design of products, processes, and systems must include integration and interconnectivity with available energy and materials flows.
# Design for Commercial "Afterlife" – Products, processes, and systems should be designed for performance in a commercial "afterlife."
# Renewable Rather Than Depleting – Material and energy inputs should be renewable rather than depleting..&lt;ref&gt;American Chemical Society (2014). 12 Principles of Green Engineering. http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/what-is-green-chemistry/principles/12-principles-of-green-engineering.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems approach==

To varying extents, all engineering disciplines engage in green engineering. This includes [[sustainable design]], [[life cycle analysis]] (LCA), [[pollution prevention]], design for the environment (DfE), design for disassembly (DfD), and design for recycling (DfR).  As such, green engineering is a subset of [[sustainable engineering]].
Green engineering involves four basic approaches to improve processes and products to make them more efficient from an environmental standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008), Sustainable Design: The Science of Sustainability and Green Engineering. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, {{ISBN|0470130628}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Waste reduction;
# Materials management;
# Pollution prevention; and,
# Product enhancement.

Green engineering approaches design from a systematic perspective, which means that numerous professional disciplines must be integrated. In addition to all engineering disciplines, green engineering includes land use planning, architecture, landscape architecture, and other design fields, as well as the social sciences(e.g. to determine how various groups of people use products and services. Designers have always been concerned with space. Architects consider the sense of place. Engineers view the site map as a set of fluxes across the boundary. Planners consider the combinations of these systems over larger regions, e.g. urban areas. 
The life cycle analysis is an important green engineering tool, which provides a holistic view of the entirety of a product, process or activity, encompassing raw materials, manufacturing, transportation, distribution, use, maintenance, recycling, and final disposal. In other words, assessing its life cycle should yield a complete picture of the product. The first step in a life cycle assessment is to gather data on the flow of a material through an identifiable society. Once the quantities of various components of such a flow are known, the important functions and impacts of each step in the production, manufacture, use, and recovery/disposal are estimated. Thus, in sustainable design, engineers must optimize for variables that give the best performance in temporal frames.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The systems approach employed in green engineering is similar to [[value engineering]] (VE). [[Daniel A. Vallero]] considers green engineering to be a form of VE because both systems require that all elements and linkages within the overall project be considered to enhance the value of the project. Every component and step of the system must be challenged. Ascertaining overall value is determined not only be a project's cost-effectiveness, but other values, including environmental and public health factors. Thus, the broader sense of VE is compatible with and can be identical to green engineering, since VE is aimed at effectiveness, not just efficiency, i.e. a project is designed to achieve multiple objectives, without sacrificing any important values. [[Efficiency]] is an engineering and thermodynamic term for the ratio of an input to an output of energy and mass within a system. As the ratio approaches 100%, the system becomes more efficient. Effectiveness requires that efficiencies be met for each component, but also that the integration of components lead to an effective, multiple value-based design.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero (2003). Engineering the Risks of Hazardous Wastes. Butterworth-Heinemann, Amsterdam, Netherlands and Boston MA, {{ISBN|0750677422}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Green engineering is also a type of [[concurrent engineering]], since tasks must be parallelized to achieve multiple design objectives.

'''Historical archaeology''' is a form of [[archaeology]] dealing with places, things, and issues from the past or present when written records and oral traditions can inform and contextualize cultural material. These records can both complement and conflict with the archaeological evidence found at a particular site. Studies focus on literate, historical-period societies as opposed to non-literate, [[prehistory|prehistoric]] societies. While they may not have generated the records, the lives of people for whom there was little need for written records, such as the [[working class]], slaves, indentured labourers, and children but who live in the historical period can also be the subject of study. The sites are found on land and underwater. [[Industrial archaeology]], unless practiced at industrial sites from the prehistoric era, is a form of historical archaeology concentrating on the remains and products of industry and the Industrial era.

==Definition==
According to the overall definition given here based on methodological and theoretical aspects [[classical archaeology]] or [[egyptology]] as well as [[medieval archaeology]] are disciplines of historical archaeology. In practice however – mainly in the Americas – historical archaeology refers to the modern, post-1492 period, which in Europe is often referred to as [[postmedieval archaeology]].

In biblical studies, '''inclusio''' is a [[literary device]] based on a concentric principle, also known as '''bracketing''' or an '''envelope structure''', which consists of creating a frame by placing similar material at the beginning and end of a section, although whether this material should consist of a word or a phrase, or whether greater amounts of text also qualify, and of what length the frames section should be, are matters of some debate. Inclusio is found in various sources, both antique and new.  The purpose of an inclusio may be structural - to alert the reader to a particularly important theme - or it may serve to show how the material within the inclusio relates to the inclusio itself.  An important case of this occurs in the Gospel of Mark's treatment of the "Cursing of the Fig Tree" and the "Cleansing of the Temple" (Chapter 11).  By giving the first half of the story before the Cleansing of the Temple, and the conclusion after, Mark creates a "frame" that effectively highlights that he wants the Cleansing of the Temple to be seen in light of the Cursing of the Fig Tree - i.e. Jesus' actions in the Temple are not just a reform measure, but a judgment against it.

==In the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament)==

While this may not be evident to many of the Bible's modern day readers, the [[Hebrew Bible]] is full of literary devices, some of which, having fallen out of favor over the years, are lost on most modern readers. ''Inclusio'', of which many instances can be found in the Bible, is one of these, although many instances of its usage are not apparent to those reading translations of the Bible rather than the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] source.

Particularly noteworthy are the many instances of ''inclusio'' in the [[Book of Jeremiah]]. A rather far-flung example of ''inclusio'' in the Book of Jeremiah can be found in its first section, chapters 1–24, which are enveloped both by a similar question in the first and last episode (1:11, 24:3), and by similar imagery—that of almond rods and baskets of figs. ''Inclusio'' may also be found between chapters 36 and 45, both of which mention Baruch ben Nerya, to whom Jeremiah's prophecies were entrusted. ''Bracketing'' can also be seen in The Lord's sayings in 1:10 and 24:6. Indeed, the whole book save for its last (52nd) chapter—which some claim was appended to it—can be thought of as inside the ''inclusio'' formed by 1:1 and 51:64, both of which mention the preaching of Jeremiah (דברי ירמיה), thus implying the lateness of chapter 52; although analyzing whether so trivial a measure has any meaning but that which appeases the eye is best left to the astute reader. None of this is to say that the shorter forms of inclusio—those in which the section enframed is quite shorter—are not found in the Book of Jeremiah. An example is found in Jeremiah 4:22, which reads:

{| align="center" dir="rtl"
|כי אויל עמי אותי לא ידעו בנים סכלים המה ולא נבונים המה חכמים המה להרע ולהיטיב לא ידעו.
|}

{| align="center"
([[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]]: ''For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.'')
|}

The phrase "לא ידעו" (''did not know'') is found at the beginning and the end of The Lord's analysis of his people. English translations do not preserve this structure.

Inclusio also abounds in other books of the Bible. An obvious example of inclusio is found in the first and last (29th) verses of Psalm 118 "הודו לה' כי-טוב כי לעולם חסדו.". Another, more disputed, example may be found in the [[Book of Ruth]], where one finds a certain resemblance, if somewhat [[chiastic]], between 1:1 and 1:22—in the former Elimelekh leaves [[Bethlehem]] in favor of [[Moab]], and in the latter Ruth and [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]] leave [[Moab]] in favor of Bethlehem.  Finally, it has been suggested that [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2 contains inclusio, for the male is created at the start of the passage and the female at the end, providing textual evidence for the parallels between the two.

==In Rabbinic Literature==

The rabbis of the Talmud were aware of occurrences of inclusio in the Bible, as shown by R. Yohanan's comment in the Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 10a that "Any psalm dear to David he opened with "אשרי" ('happy is he') and closed with "אשרי" ('happy is he'). Redactors of rabbinic document frequently made use of inclusio to mark off the endpoints of literary units of different sizes and possibly to suggest conceptual connections between seemingly disparate statements. At the end of the Mishnah tractate Kelim, R. Yose explicitly notes the phenomenon: "Happy are you, Kelim, in that you opened with [statements regarding] impurity and departed with [statements regarding] purity." Tractate Berakhot, which opens with a discussion of the laws of reciting the שמע (Hear O Israel) passage from Deuteronomy 6:4-9, concludes with a homiletic interpretation of the second verse from this passage (v. 5), showing how the ritual recitation of the tractate's opening may serve as a source of spiritual instruction at the tractate's end. Tractate Nazir is framed by allusions to two famous biblical Nazirites - Samson (M. Nazir 1:2) and Samuel (M. Nazir 9:5), representing respectively negative and positive exemplars of this institution.

Many chapters of Mishnah are also framed by inclusio. In the opening mishnah of Taanit Chapter 1, R. Joshua notes that rain on the festival of Sukkot is "not a sign of blessing", and the closing mishnah of the chapter notes that rainfall after the month of Nisan is "a sign of curse". This characterization of rainfall as God's way of communicating His blessings and curses is a central theme of the chapter. Sometimes the inclusio is based on a wordplay. Ohalot Chapter 7 opens with a discussion of corpse impurity in a "נפש אטומה" ('solid monument')and closes with the statement that a baby whose head has emerged from the womb may not be killed to save the mother because "אין דוחין נפש מפני נפש" ('one soul may not be set aside in favor of another'). The use of the word נפש (nefesh) at the beginning and the end of the chapter in opposite meanings, symbolizing respectively death and life, emphasize the interconnection between the mysteries of birth and of death.

Examples of inclusio may be found in later rabbinic literature as well. Tosefta Makkot Chapter 3 opens and closes with statements regarding the designation of three cities of refuge. Homilies regarding Isaiah 32:20 appear at the beginning and end of BT Bava Kamma Chapter 1. The opening homily of Leviticus Rabba 29 asserts that the fate of Adam on the day of his creation is a sign for his children annually on the same date, and the closing homily of this section asserts that when Israel observes the commandments of this day God will regard them as having been created anew. Rabbinic redactors, following in the footsteps of their biblical predecessors, continued to employ inclusio as a literary marker and tool.

==In the New Testament==

The [[New Testament]] also uses inclusio. The main teaching part in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] starts and ends with the expression “the Law and the Prophets” (Matthew 5:17 + 7:12). [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]’s account of the first part of [[Jesus]]’ public ministry is framed by an account on his teaching and his miracles (Matthew 4:23 +9:35).
Also, Matthew’s Gospel begins with the prophecy that Jesus' name would be “Emmanuel, that is, ‘God with us,’” (1:23, in which the author has linked Isaiah 7:14 and 8:8, 10 together) and it ends with the promise, "I am with you always, to the end of the age". This forms an inclusio about Jesus in his relationship to his people that suggests his deity. 
The [[letter to the Hebrews]] uses [[Jeremiah]]’s prophecy as an inclusio in 8:8-12 and 10:16-18.
There are many more examples of this literary device in the New Testament.

'''Intuition''' is the ability to acquire knowledge without [[proof (truth)|proof]], [[evidence]], or conscious [[reason]]ing, or without understanding how the knowledge was acquired.&lt;ref name="Webster dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |title=intuition|url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/intuition |accessdate= 22 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different writers give the word "intuition" a great variety of different meanings, ranging from direct access to unconscious knowledge, unconscious cognition, inner sensing, inner insight to unconscious pattern-recognition and the ability to understand something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning.&lt;ref name="AurobindoDef"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Aurobindo |first1=  Sri  |title=The synthesis of yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=479–480|publisher=Sri Aurobindo ashram trust |location=Pondicherry |isbn= 978-0-9415-2465-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt&gt;Intuition and consciousness – Rosenblatt AD, Thickstun JT.

==Philosophy==
Both [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern]] and [[Western philosophy|Western]] philosophers have studied the concept in great detail. [[Philosophy of mind]] deals with the concept of intuition.

===Eastern philosophy===
In the East intuition is mostly intertwined with [[religion]] and [[spirituality]], and various meanings exist from different religious texts.&lt;ref name="eastern"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leaman |first1=Oliver   |title=Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=FLuEAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 December 2014 |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= 0-415-17357-4 |pages=5–40 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
In Hinduism various attempts have been made to interpret the [[Vedas|Vedic]] and other esoteric texts.

For [[Sri Aurobindo]]  intuition comes under the realms of knowledge by identity, he describes the psychological plane in human (often referred to as mana in [[sanskrit]]) has two arbitrary nature, the first being imprinting of psychological experiences which is constructed through sensory information (mind seeking to become aware of external world). The second nature being the action when it seeks to be aware of itself, resulting in humans being aware of their existence or aware of being angry &amp; aware of other emotions, he terms this second nature is knowledge by identity.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=68|ps=}}
He finds that at present as the result of evolution the mind has accustomed itself to depend upon certain physiological functioning and their reactions as its normal means of entering into relation with outer material world, as a result when we seek to know about external world the dominant habit is through arriving at truth about things via as much as senses convey to us.  However, with  knowledge by identity which we currently only gives the awareness of human beings existence can be extended further to outside of ourselves resulting in intuitive knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|pp=69-71|ps=}}

He finds this intuitive knowledge was common to older humans ([[Vedic]]) and later was taken over by [[reason]] which currently organises our perception, thoughts and actions resulting in from Vedic to metaphysical philosophy and later to experimental science. he finds that this process which seems to be a decent, is actual a circle of progress.  As a lower faculty is being pushed to take up as much from a higher way of working.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=75|ps=}} He finds when self-awareness in mind is applied to own-self and the outer (other-Self), results in luminous self-manifest identity, the reason also converts itself into the form of the self-luminous intuitional knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=72|ps=}}&lt;ref name="Integral yoga"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Aurobindo |first1=  Sri  |title=The synthesis of yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=799–800|publisher=Sri Aurobindo ashram trust |location=Pondicherry |isbn= 978-0-9415-2465-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=7|ps=}}

[[Rajneesh|Osho]] believed consciousness of human beings to be in increasing order from basic animal [[instinct]]s to intelligence and intuition, and humans being constantly living in that conscious state often moving between these states depending on their affinity and he also suggests living in the state of intuition is one of the ultimate aims of humanity.&lt;ref name="osho"&gt;{{cite book |last1= osho |first1=  Bhagwan  |title=Intuition: Knowing Beyond Logic |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=zyBfk5V5HRkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=osho+on+intuition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y8maVNOMEInzPJHLgbgN&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 December 2014 |pages=10–20|publisher=osho international foundation |location=New York |isbn= 0-312-27567-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Advaita]] vedanta (a school of thought) takes intuition to be an experience through which one can come in contact with and experience [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name="advaita"&gt;{{cite book |last1= M.

====Buddhism====
Buddhism finds intuition being a faculty in the mind of immediate knowledge and puts the term intuition beyond mental process of conscious [[thinking]], as the conscious intellect cannot necessarily access subconscious information, or render such information into a communicable form.&lt;ref name="Sumedho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buddhismnow.com/2013/08/07/buddha-by-ajahn-sumedho/|title=Buddha, by  Ajahn Sumedho|work=Buddhism now}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Zen Buddhism]] various techniques have been developed to help develop ones intuitive capability, such as [[koans]] – the resolving of which leads to states of minor enlightenment ([[satori]]). In parts of Zen Buddhism intuition is deemed a mental state between the Universal mind and one's individual, discriminating mind.&lt;ref name="Bdictionary"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Humphreys |first1= Christmas |title=A Popular Dictionary of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TlWRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT406&amp;dq=intuition+in+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=enmZVNyjLs32O8vlgdAM&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition%20in%20buddhism&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= 0-203-98616-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zen Buddhism"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Conners |first1=  Shawn  |title=Zen Buddhism – The Path to Enlightenment |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zVPUsSW-by0C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=intuition+in+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iXeZVLu3LsjDOZjFgfgD&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition%20in%20buddhism&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014 |page=81|publisher=El paso trust |location=Texas |isbn= 1-934255-97-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
In Islam there are various scholars with varied interpretation of intuition (often termed as hads ([[Arabic]]: حدس), hitting correctly on a mark), sometimes relating the ability of having intuitive knowledge to [[prophet]]hood. 
[[Shahab al-Din Yahya ibn Habash Suhrawardi|Siháb al Din-al Suhrawadi]], in his book ''Philosophy Of Illumination'' (ishraq) finds that intuition is a knowledge acquired through illumination and is mystical in nature and also suggests mystical contemplation ([[mushahada]]) on this to bring about correct judgments.&lt;ref name="Islam1"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lawson |first1=  Todd  |title=Reason and Inspiration in Islam: Theology, Philosophy and Mysticism in Muslim Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bq9zSbNr8gIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=210–225|publisher=I.B touris co ltd |location=London |isbn=1-85043-470-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Ibn Sīnā]] finds the ability of having intuition as a "prophetic capacity" and terms it as a knowledge obtained without intentionally acquiring it. He finds that regular knowledge is based on imitation while intuitive knowledge as based on intellectual certitude.&lt;ref name="Islam2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kalin |first1=  Ibrahim  |title=Knowledge in Later Islamic Philosophy: Mulla Sadra on Existence, Intellect, and Intuition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6EGwDLio0QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=155–160|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western philosophy===
In the West, intuition does not appear as a separate field of study, and early mention and definition can be traced back to [[Plato]]. In his book ''[[Plato Republic|Republic]]'' he tries to define intuition as a fundamental capacity of human [[reason]] to comprehend the true nature of [[reality]].&lt;ref name="Plato"&gt;{{cite web |title=Plato: Education and the Value of Justice |url=http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2h.htm |accessdate= |last = Kemerling|first = Garth|date = 12 November 2011|website = Philosophy Pages }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his works ''[[Meno (Plato)|Meno]]'' and ''[[Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo]]'', he describes intuition as a pre-existing knowledge residing in the "soul of eternity," and a phenomenon by which one becomes conscious of pre-existing knowledge. He provides an example of mathematical truths, and posits that they are not arrived at by reason. He argues that these truths are accessed using a knowledge already present in a dormant form and accessible to our intuitive capacity. This concept by Plato is also sometimes referred to as [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]. The study was later continued by his [[Neo-platonism|followers]].&lt;ref name="Meno"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klein |first1= Jacob |title=A Commentary on Plato's Meno|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Commentary_on_Plato_s_Meno.html?id=HXI2lcrSsxIC&amp;redir_esc=y |accessdate=22 December 2014 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-43959-3 |pages=103–127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', [[René Descartes|Descartes]] refers to an intuition as a pre-existing knowledge gained through rational reasoning or discovering truth through contemplation. This definition is commonly referred to as [[logical intuition|rational intuition]].&lt;ref name="Descartes"&gt;{{cite book |last1= L. Mursell |first1=James |title=The Philosophical Review  |series=4 |volume=28 |publisher= Duke University Press |location=USA |pages=391–401 |chapter=The Function of Intuition in Descartes' Philosophy of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later philosophers, such as [[David Hume|Hume]], have more ambiguous interpretations of intuition. Hume claims intuition is a recognition of relationships (relation of time, place, and causation) while he states that "the resemblance" (recognition of relations) "will strike the eye" (which would not require further examination) but goes on to state, "or rather in mind" – attributing intuition to power of mind, contradicting the theory of [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="hume"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hume|first1=David |title=A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RIusIRd2q8C|accessdate=23 December 2014  |publisher=The Floating Press  |isbn= 9781775410676|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite book |last1=  A. Johnson|first1= Oliver|title=The Mind of David Hume: A Companion to Book I of A Treatise of Human Nature |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=fMjhcXhrv48C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=david+hume+on+intuition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lDorBgwuhQ&amp;sig=4X0cOWxYQunqi8k_8rb5R5W8lbA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ai-ZVJy8HcWHPbeQgYAB&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014  |publisher=The Floating Press |isbn= 0-252-02156-8|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] finds intuition is thought of as basic sensory information provided by the [[cognitive]] faculty of sensibility (equivalent to what might loosely be called [[perception]]). Kant held that our [[mind]] casts all of our external intuitions in the form of [[space]], and all of our internal intuitions ([[memory]], thought) in the form of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|url= https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=5144&amp;pageno=35|title= Critique of Pure Reason|publisher= gutenberg.org|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intuitionism]] is a position advanced by [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]] in [[philosophy of mathematics]] derived from Kant's claim that all [[mathematics|mathematical knowledge]] is knowledge of the pure forms of the intuition – that is, intuition that is not empirical. [[Intuitionistic logic]] was devised by [[Arend Heyting]] to accommodate this position (and has been adopted by other forms of [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]] in general). It is characterized by rejecting the [[law of excluded middle]]: as a consequence it does not in general accept rules such as [[double negation elimination]] and the use of [[reductio ad absurdum]] to prove the existence of something.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Intuitions are customarily appealed to independently of any particular theory of how intuitions provide evidence for claims, and there are divergent accounts of what sort of mental state intuitions are, ranging from mere spontaneous judgment to a special presentation of a necessary truth.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lynch "Trusting Intuitions", in P. Greenough and M. Lynch (ed) ''Truth and Realism'', pp. 227-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in recent years a number of philosophers, especially [[George Bealer]] have tried to defend appeals to intuition against [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quinean]] doubts about [[conceptual analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Bealer "Intuition and The Autonomy of Philosophy" in M. Depaul and W. Ramsey (eds) ''Rethinking Intuition: The Psychology of Intuition and Its Role In Philosophical Inquiry'' 1998, pp. 201-239.&lt;/ref&gt; A different challenge to appeals to intuition has recently come from [[experimental philosophy|experimental philosophers]], who argue that appeals to intuition must be informed by the methods of social science.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[metaphilosophy|metaphilosophical]] assumption that philosophy depends on intuitions has recently been challenged by some philosophers. [[Timothy Williamson]] has argued that intuition plays no special role in philosophy practice, and that skepticism about intuition cannot be meaningfully separated from a general [[skepticism]] about judgment. On this view, there are no qualitative differences between the methods of philosophy and common sense, the sciences or mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Timothy (2008) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=YN2KGBgKwOcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false The Philosophy of Philosophy]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==

===Freud===
According to Sigmund [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], knowledge could only be attained through the intellectual manipulation of carefully made observations and rejected any other means of acquiring knowledge such as intuition, and his findings could have been an analytic turn of his mind towards the subject.&lt;ref name="Freud"&gt;{{cite book |last1=  Walker Punerr|first1= Helen |title=Sigmund Freud: His Life and Mind |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=386tCTzeb28C&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=intuition+sigmund+freud&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1DqgVLCrJcvfPYeWgLAK&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=28 December 2014  |publisher=Transaction Publishers |pages=197–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jung===
In [[Carl Jung]]'s theory of the [[Human ego|ego]], described in 1916 in ''[[Psychological Types]]'', intuition is an "irrational function", opposed most directly by sensation, and opposed less strongly by the "rational functions" of thinking and feeling. Jung defined intuition as "perception via the unconscious": using sense-perception only as a starting point, to bring forth ideas, images, possibilities, ways out of a blocked situation, by a process that is mostly unconscious.&lt;ref name=ptypes /&gt;

Jung said that a person in whom intuition is dominant, an "intuitive type", acts not on the basis of rational judgment but on sheer intensity of perception. An extraverted intuitive type, "the natural champion of all minorities with a future", orients to new and promising but unproven possibilities, often leaving to chase after a new possibility before old ventures have borne fruit, oblivious to his or her own welfare in the constant pursuit of change. An introverted intuitive type orients by images from the unconscious, ever exploring the psychic world of the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], seeking to perceive the meaning of events, but often having no interest in playing a role in those events and not seeing any connection between the contents of the psychic world and him- or herself. Jung thought that extraverted intuitive types were likely entrepreneurs, speculators, cultural revolutionaries, often undone by a desire to escape every situation before it becomes settled and constraining—even repeatedly leaving lovers for the sake of new romantic possibilities. His introverted intuitive types were likely mystics, prophets, or cranks, struggling with a tension between protecting their visions from influence by others and making their ideas comprehensible and reasonably persuasive to others—a necessity for those visions to bear real fruit.&lt;ref name=ptypes&gt;C.G. Jung. ''Psychological Types''. Bollingen Series XX, Volume 6, Princeton University Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern psychology===
In more-recent psychology, intuition can encompass the ability to know valid solutions to problems and [[decision making]]. For example, the [[recognition primed decision]] (RPD) model explains how people can make relatively fast decisions without having to compare options. [[Gary A. Klein|Gary Klein]] found that under time pressure, high stakes, and changing parameters, experts used their base of experience to identify similar situations and intuitively choose feasible solutions. Thus, the RPD model is a blend of intuition and analysis. The intuition is the pattern-matching process that quickly suggests feasible courses of action. The [[analysis]] is the mental simulation, a conscious and deliberate review of the courses of action.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Gary. ''Intuition At Work''. Random House, NY, NY. January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Instinct]] is often misinterpreted as intuition and its reliability considered to be dependent on past knowledge and occurrences in a specific area. For example, someone who has had more experiences with children will tend to have a better instinct about what they should do in certain situations with them. This is not to say that one with a great amount of experience is always going to have an accurate intuition.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Sadler-Smith. Inside Intuition. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intuitive abilities were quantitatively tested at Yale University in the 1970s. While studying [[nonverbal communication]], researchers noted that some subjects were able to read nonverbal facial cues before reinforcement occurred.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini, J Daood, MC Giannini, R Boniface, PG Rhodes. Intellect versus intuition--dichotomy in the reception of nonverbal communication.Journal of General Psychology. 99:19-24,1978.&lt;/ref&gt; In employing a similar design, they noted that highly intuitive subjects made decisions quickly but could not identify their rationale. Their level of accuracy, however, did not differ from that of non intuitive subjects.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini, ME Barringer, MC Giannini, RH Loiselle. Lack of relationship between handedness and intuitive and intellectual (rationalistic) modes of information processing. Journal of General Psychology. 111:31-37 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colloquial usage==
Intuition, as a gut feeling based on experience, has been found to be useful for business leaders for making judgement about people, culture and strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epubs.scu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&amp;context=gcm_pubs|title=Australian Elite Leaders, Intuition and Effectiveness |publisher=epubs.scu.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement officers often claim to observe suspects and immediately "know" that they possess a weapon or illicit narcotic substances, which could also be action of [[instinct]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/concept-creep/477939/|title=Why Americans Are So Sensitive to Harm|first=Conor|last=Friedersdorf|date=|website=theatlantic.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often unable to articulate why they reacted or what prompted them at the time of the event, they sometimes retrospectively can plot their actions based upon what had been clear and present danger signals. Such examples liken intuition to "[[Feeling#Stomach feeling|gut feelings]]" and when viable illustrate [[preconscious]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Pinizzotto, PhD, Edward F. Davis, MA, and Charles E. Miller III [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Emotional%2Frational+decision+making+in+law+enforcement-a0114370262 Emotional/rational decision making in law enforcement] (Federal Bureau of Investigation), ''Free Online Library'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19363">The '''knowledge gap hypothesis''' explains that [[knowledge]], like other forms of [[wealth]], is often [[Income inequality|differentially distributed]] throughout a social system.  Specifically, the hypothesis predicts that "as the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases, segments of the population with higher  [[socioeconomic status]] tend to acquire this information at a faster rate than the lower status segments, so that the gap in knowledge between these segments tends to increase rather than decrease".&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tichenor|first=P.A. |author2=Donohue, G.A. |author3=Olien, C.N.|title=Mass media flow and differential growth in knowledge|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=34|issue=2|pages=159–170|doi=10.1086/267786|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip J. Tichenor, then Associate Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication, George A. Donohue, Professor of Sociology, and Clarice N. Olien, Instructor in Sociology – three [[University of Minnesota]] researchers – first proposed the knowledge gap hypothesis in 1970.

==Foundations==

Although first formally articulated in 1970, Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt; note that the knowledge gap hypothesis has been implicit throughout the mass communication literature.

Indeed, research published as early as the 1920s had already begun to examine the influence of individual characteristics on people's media content preferences.  For example, Gray and Munroe&lt;ref name="Gray Munroe 1929"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=W.S.|title=The Reading Interests and Habits of Adults|year=1929|publisher=The Macmillan Company|location=New York|author2=Munroe, R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; identified education – still used today as an operationalization of socioeconomic status in knowledge gap research (see, e.g., Hwang and Jeong, 2009)&lt;ref name="Hwang Jeong 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hwang|first=Y|author2=Jeong, S-H. |title=Revisiting the knowledge gap hypothesis: A meta-analysis of thirty-five years of research|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|year=2009|volume=86|issue=3|pages=513–532|doi=10.1177/107769900908600304}}&lt;/ref&gt; – as a significant and positive correlate of a person's tendency to prefer "serious" (rather than non-serious) print content.

Popular belief, however, held that such differences in preferences might be diminished by the advent of radio, which required neither the special skill nor the exertion of reading (Lazarsfeld, 1940).&lt;ref name="Lazarsfeld 1940"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lazarsfeld|first=P.F.|title=Radio and the Printed Page|year=1940|publisher=Duell, Sloan, and Pearce|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guglielmo Marconi, inventor of the wireless telegraph, even believed that the radio would "make war impossible, because it will make war ridiculous" (Narodny, 1912, p.&amp;nbsp;145).&lt;ref name="Narodny 1912"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Narodny|first=I.|title=Marconi's plans for the world|journal=The Technical World Magazine|year=1912|volume=18|pages=145–150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eqpMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=marconi+plans+for+the+world&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kE1RT_2PBcbFtgfT3PSgDQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=%22the%20coming%20of%20the%20wireless%20era%20will%20make%20war%20impossible%2C%20because%20it%20will%20make%20war%20ridiculous%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interested in whether radio had attenuated these individual differences in content preferences, Paul Lazarsfeld, head of the Office of Radio Research at Columbia University, set out to examine whether (1) the total amount of time that people listened to the radio and (2) the type of content they listened to correlated with their socioeconomic status.  Not only did Lazarsfeld's data indicate people of lower socioeconomic status tended to listen to more radio programming, but also they were simultaneously less likely to listen to "serious" radio content.  Contrary to popular belief at the time, then, the widespread adoption of the radio seems to have had little, if any, effect on a person's tendency to prefer specific types of content.

Further evidence supporting the knowledge gap hypothesis came from Star and Hughes (1950)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Star|first=S.|author2=Hughes, H.M |title=Report of an education campaign: The Cincinnati plan for the United Nations|journal=American Journal of Sociology|year=1950|volume=55|pages=389–397|doi=10.1086/220562}}&lt;/ref&gt;  analysis of efforts to inform Cincinnati adults about the United Nations.  Like Gray and Munroe (1929)&lt;ref name="Gray Munroe 1929" /&gt;  and Lazarsfeld (1940)&lt;ref name="Lazarsfeld 1940" /&gt;  before them, Star and Hughes found that while the campaign was successful in reaching better-educated people, those with less education virtually ignored the campaign.  Additionally, after realizing that the highly educated people reached by the campaign also tended to be more interested in the topic, Star and Hughes suggested that knowledge, education, and interest may be interdependent.

==Specification==

Based on observations implicit in mass communication research, Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1970) define the knowledge gap hypothesis as follows:
:"As the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases, higher socioeconomic status segments tend to acquire this information faster than lower socioeconomic-status population segments so that the gap in knowledge between the two tends to increase rather than decrease" (Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien 1970, pp. 159-160).&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;

Additionally, Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien suggest 5 reasons why the knowledge gap should exist:&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt; 
ailor their conte
# ''Communication skills'': higher status people generally have more education, which improves their reading, comprehension, and memory skills;
# ''Stored information'': higher status people are more likely to already know of topics in the news through previous media exposure or through formal education;
# ''Relevant social contact'': higher status people generally have a broader sphere of activity, greater number of reference groups, and interpersonal contacts and are thus more likely to discuss news topics with others;
# ''Selective exposure'': lower status people may be less interested, and therefore less likely to expose themselves to certain news topics; and
# ''Media target markets'': media outlets cater to the tastes and interests of their audience.

==Formal summary==

Given the preceding information, the knowledge gap hypothesis can be expressed using the following set of related propositions:
# People in a society exhibit great psychological diversity due to their psychological makeup, learned experiences, social relationships, and social category memberships.
# Despite these differences, people with more education tend to have better developed cognitive and communication skills, broader social spheres with more and more diverse social contacts, and a greater amount of stored information than their counterparts with less education.
# People with greater education also tend express interest in, and expose themselves to, a broader range of topics, including serious topics like public affairs, science, and health news.
# Therefore, as the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases, segments of the population with higher socioeconomic status tend to acquire this information at a faster rate than the lower status segments so that the gap in knowledge between these segments tends to increase rather than decrease.

==Hypothesis operationalization and initial support==
The knowledge gap hypothesis can be operationalized both for cross-sectional and time-series appropriate research.  For cross-sectional research, the knowledge gap hypothesis expects that "''at any given time'', there should be a higher correlation between acquisition of knowledge and education for topics highly publicized in the media than for topics less highly publicized.&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;   Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1970) tested this hypothesis using an experiment in which participants were asked to read and discuss two news stories of varying publicity.  The results of the experiment support the hypothesis because correlations between education and understanding were significant for high publicity stories but not significant for low publicity stories.&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;

For time-series research, the knowledge gap hypothesis expects that "''over time'', acquisition of knowledge of a heavily publicized topic will proceed at a faster rate among better educated persons than among those with less education."&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;   Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1970) tested this hypothesis using public opinion surveys gathered between 1949 and 1965 measuring whether participants believed humans would reach the Moon in the foreseeable future.  During the 15-year span, belief among grade-school educated people increased only about 25 percentage points while belief among college educated people increased more than 60 percentage points, a trend consistent with the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;

==Refining the hypothesis==

Although by the mid-1970s extensive data supported the existence of a knowledge gap among low and high socioeconomic status individuals, Donohue, Tichenor, and Olien (1975)&lt;ref name="Donohue, Tichenor, Olien 1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Donohue|first=G.A.|author2=Tichenor, P.J. |author3=Olien, C.N. |title=Mass media and the knowledge gap: A hypothesis revisited|journal=Communication Research|year=1975|volume=2|issue=1|pages=3–23|doi=10.1177/009365027500200101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  sought to refine the hypothesis to determine under what conditions the knowledge gap might be attenuated or even eliminated.  To this end, they examined survey data on national and local issues from probability samples of 16 Minnesota communities gathered between 1969 and 1975.  Donohue and colleagues identified three variables that weakened the knowledge gap:
# ''Level of basic social concern aroused by the issue'' - Local issues that directly implicated the community tended to arouse greater social concern than national issues that did not implicate the community.  Local issues, then, tended to decrease the magnitude of the knowledge gap.
# ''Level of social conflict surrounding the issue'' - Up to the point at which a communication breakdown occurred, issues with more perceived conflict tended to draw more attention and, thus, decrease the magnitude of the knowledge gap.
# ''Level of homogeneity of the community'' - Because smaller, more homogeneous communities tend to exhibit less social differentiation and variety in sources of information than larger, more heterogeneous communities, homogeneous communities tended to exhibit smaller knowledge gaps than heterogeneous communities.

==Narrative review and meta-analytic support==

At least two narrative reviews and one meta-analysis of knowledge gap hypothesis research exist.  Gaziano conducted two narrative reviews, one of 58 articles with relevant data in 1983&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaziano|first=C.|title=The knowledge gap: An analytical review of media effects|journal=Communication Research|year=1983|volume=10|issue=4|pages=447–486|doi=10.1177/009365083010004003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the other of 39 additional studies in 1997.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaziano|first=C.|title=Forecast 2000: Widening knowledge gaps|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|year=1997|volume=74|issue=2|pages=237–264|doi=10.1177/107769909707400202}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gaziano writes, "the most consistent result is the presence of knowledge differentials, regardless of topic, methodological, or theoretical variations, study excellence, or other variables and conditions" (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;240).  Evidence from several decades, Gaziano concludes, underscores the enduring character of knowledge gaps and indicates that they transcend topics and research settings.

Because narrative reviews examine significance tests rather than effect sizes, Hwang and Jeong (2009)&lt;ref name="Hwang Jeong 2009"/&gt; conducted a meta-analysis of 46 knowledge gap studies.  Consistent with Gaziano's results, however, Hwang and Jeong found constant knowledge gaps across time.

==Closing the knowledge gap hypothesis with Web 2.0==
In 2010 Elizabeth Corley and Dietram Scheufele conducted a study to investigate the widening knowledge gap with the example of nanotechnology. On the whole, public opinion research has shown that respondents with higher socioeconomic status (SES) acquire new information at a higher rate than low SES respondents. Their previous analyses of two large national surveys conducted in 2004 and 2007 found that respondents with at least a college degree displayed an increase in knowledge levels between 2004 and 2007 while respondents with education levels of less than a high school diploma had a significant decrease in nanotechnology knowledge levels. These results stress that the group that is most in need of help, low SES bracket, have not been helped through communication efforts and their nanotechnology knowledge levels have decreased over time.

Corley and Scheufele investigated a wide range of factors that may help to close knowledge gaps, including mass media. The researchers found that the number of days a week that respondents spent online was significantly correlated to knowledge levels about nanotechnology. Therefore, internet use helped those with less formal education to catch up to their counterparts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Corley, E. A., &amp; Scheufele, D. A. (forthcoming). Outreach gone wrong? When we talk nano to the public, we are leaving behind key audiences. The Scientist.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the Internet, and more specifically Web 2.0, may be playing a role in closing the knowledge gap. In fact, Corley and Scheufele explain that "the internet may finally live up to the hype … as a tool for creating a more informed citizenry by serving as a "leveler" of knowledge gaps." (2010, p.&amp;nbsp;2)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This is widely due to the fact that information on Web 2.0 is written in layman's terms. The content is created by those individuals who have an understanding of the information, but who are also able to tailor the articles towards a more general audience.

Still, the knowledge gap may still exist even with the emergence of Web 2.0. The disenfranchised group, in this situation, the group with lower SES, must still be motivated to get the information to close the gap. Also, information about a given subject must be given. Without the content being provided, Web 2.0 will not be much of a help.  However, if the content is provided, Web 2.0 has allowed the readers to be more interactive and talk with others online, through discussion boards, forums and blogs. The results of the research conducted by Corley and Scheufele are a clear call to action for researchers to investigate non-traditional ways of connecting with lay audiences about emerging technologies.

Overall, studies show the introduction of Web 2.0 may help in closing the knowledge gap because the content that traditionally those with lower SES could not reach, can now be understood because it is written in layman's terms. Web 2.0 has helped because:
# The content on Web 2.0 is created by everyday people, for everyday people
# As a user, you can be interactive to find more information about a given subject (click through other links to find more information, search for theories and ideas you don't know on search engines, or read supplemented articles to get more information)

==Criticism and directions for future research==

# Although the majority of research supports the proposition that the higher the education, the greater the knowledge of various topics, the knowledge gap hypothesis specifies that this relationship should be moderated by the level of media publicity a given issue receives.  Few knowledge gap studies, however, treat media publicity as a variable.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997" /&gt;
# Because time-trend analyses indicate knowledge differentials fluctuate over time, most one-shot studies offer a brief and potentially misleading snapshot of knowledge gaps.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997" /&gt;
# A new, vital area for knowledge gap researchers to understand is the role of the family in socialization patterns related to learning.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997" /&gt;
# Because policy decisions have played a major role in increasing inequality, and knowledge gap research has policy implications, researchers should include more dialogue with policymakers.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997" /&gt;

== Competing hypotheses ==

There are now three existing competing hypotheses: 1) Media Malaise hypothesis (that predicts a general negative effect), 2) the Virtuous Circle hypothesis (that predicts a general positive effect), and 3) the Differential Effect hypothesis (that predicts a positive effect from newspapers, and a null or negative effect from television)" (Fraile, 2011).&lt;ref name="Fraile 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraile|first=M.|title=Widening or reducing the knowledge gap? Testing the media effects on political knowledge in Spain (2004-2006)|journal=[[International Journal of Press/Politics]]|year=2011|volume=16|issue=2|pages=163–184|doi=10.1177/1940161210388413}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three types of media outlets have been used to examine the media effects on knowledge gap: 1) Television – knowledge gap between lower and higher education groups are greater among light television users compared to heavy television users (Eveland, 2000),&lt;ref name="Eveland Scheufele 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eveland|first=W.P.|author2=Scheufele, D.A. |title=Connecting news media use with gaps in knowledge and participation.|journal=[[Political Communication (journal)|Political Communication]]|year=2000|volume=17|issue=3|pages=215–237|doi=10.1080/105846000414250}}&lt;/ref&gt;  2) Newspaper – the exposure to newspaper can potentially reinforce the knowledge gap in politics for different SES groups since reading newspaper requires literacy ability to effectively understand the information (Jerit ''et al.'', 2006),&lt;ref name="Jerit Jason Toby 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jerit|first=J.|author2=Barabas, J. |author3=Bolsen, T. |title=Citizens, knowledge, and the information environment|journal=[[American Journal of Political Science]]|year=2006|volume=50|issue=2|pages=266–282|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00183.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while other studies suggest that exposure to newspaper actually slightly decreases the knowledge gap rather than increasing it (Eveland, 2000),&lt;ref name="Eveland Scheufele 2000" /&gt;  and 3) Internet - internet exposure increases public's general knowledge in health issues (Shim, 2008).&lt;ref name="Shim 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shim|first=M.|title=Connecting Internet uses with gaps in cancer knowledge|journal=[[Health Communication]]|year=2008|volume=23|issue=6|pages=448–461|doi=10.1080/10410230802342143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pedal-driven-weaving-machine.jpg|thumb|A foot-treadle operated [[Geo. Hattersley|Hattersley &amp; Sons]], Domestic Loom, built under licence in 1893, in [[Keighley]], Yorkshire.]]
[[File:loomwork.jpg|thumb|A woman in [[Konya]], [[Turkey]], works at a [[#Haute lisse and basse lisse looms|vertical]] loom]]
A '''loom''' is a device used to [[weaving|weave]] cloth and tapestry. The basic purpose of any loom is to hold the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] threads under [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] to facilitate the interweaving of the [[weft]] threads. The precise shape of the loom and its mechanics may vary, but the basic function is the same.

==Etymology==
The word "loom" is derived from the [[Old English]] ''geloma'', formed from ge-(perfective prefix) and ''loma'', a root of unknown origin; this meant a utensil, tool, or machine of any kind.  In 1404 it was used to mean a machine to enable weaving thread into cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=loom|title=loom - Origin and meaning of loom by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1838, it had gained the meaning of a machine for interlacing thread.

==Weaving==
{{see also|Weaving|Textile manufacturing terminology}}
[[File:Weaving demonstrated on a historic loom in Leiden.webm|thumbtime=12|thumb|right|Weaving demonstration on an 1830 handloom in the [[Museum Het Leids Wevershuis|weaving museum]] in [[Leiden]] ]]
Weaving is done by intersecting the longitudinal threads, the '''[[Warp (weaving)|warp]]''', i.e. "that which is thrown across",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=warp|title=warp - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the transverse threads, the '''[[weft]]''', i.e. "that which is woven".

The major components of the loom are the warp beam, [[heddle]]s, harnesses or shafts (as few as two, four is common, sixteen not unheard of), [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]], [[reed (weaving)|reed]] and takeup roll. In the loom, yarn processing includes shedding, picking, battening and taking-up operations. These are the principal motions.

*'''Shedding'''. Shedding is the raising of part of the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] yarn to form a [[shed (weaving)|shed]] (the vertical space between the raised and unraised warp yarns), through which the filling yarn, carried by the shuttle, can be inserted, forming the weft. On the modern loom, simple and intricate shedding operations are performed automatically by the heddle or heald frame, also known as a harness. This is a rectangular frame to which a series of wires, called heddles or healds, are attached. The yarns are passed through the eye holes of the heddles, which hang vertically from the harnesses. The weave pattern determines which harness controls which warp yarns, and the number of harnesses used depends on the complexity of the weave. Two common methods of controlling the heddles are [[Dobby loom|dobbies]] and a [[Jacquard Loom|Jacquard Head]].
[[File:Weaving shuttles.JPG|thumb|Shuttles]]
*'''Picking'''. As the harnesses raise the [[heddle]]s or healds, which raise the warp yarns, the shed is created. The filling yarn is inserted through the shed by a small carrier device called a shuttle. The shuttle is normally pointed at each end to allow passage through the shed. In a traditional shuttle loom, the filling yarn is wound onto a quill, which in turn is mounted in the shuttle. The filling yarn emerges through a hole in the shuttle as it moves across the loom. A single crossing of the shuttle from one side of the loom to the other is known as a pick. As the shuttle moves back and forth across the shed, it weaves an edge, or [[selvage]], on each side of the fabric to prevent the fabric from raveling.
*'''Battening'''. Between the heddles and the takeup roll, the warp threads pass through another frame called the reed (which resembles a comb). The portion of the fabric that has already been formed but not yet rolled up on the takeup roll is called the fell. After the shuttle moves across the loom laying down the fill yarn, the weaver uses the reed to press (or batten) each filling yarn against the fell. Conventional shuttle looms can operate at speeds of about 150 to 160 picks per minute.&lt;ref name="Collier 1970 104"&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|1970|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two secondary motions, because with each weaving operation the newly constructed fabric must be wound on a cloth beam. This process is called taking up. At the same time, the warp yarns must be let off or released from the warp beams. To become fully automatic, a loom needs a tertiary motion, the filling stop motion. This will brake the loom if the weft thread breaks.&lt;ref name="Collier 1970 104"/&gt; An automatic loom requires 0.125&amp;nbsp;hp to 0.5&amp;nbsp;hp to operate.

==Types of looms==

===Back strap loom===
[[File:SantaMariadelRio145.webm|thumb|Woman weaving a silk [[rebozo]] on a backstrap loom at the Taller Escuela de Rebocería in Santa Maria del Rio, San Luis Potosí]]
A simple loom which has roots in ancient civilizations consists of two sticks or bars between which the warps are stretched. One bar is attached to a fixed object, and the other to the weaver usually by means of a strap around the back. On traditional looms, the two main sheds are operated by means of a shed roll over which one set of warps pass, and continuous string heddles which encase each of the warps in the other set. The weaver leans back and uses their body weight to tension the loom. To open the shed controlled by the string heddles, the weaver relaxes tension on the warps and raises the heddles. The other shed is usually opened by simply drawing the shed roll toward the weaver. Both simple and complex textiles can be woven on this loom. Width is limited to how far the weaver can reach from side to side to pass the shuttle. Warp faced textiles, often decorated with intricate pick-up patterns woven in complementary and supplementary warp techniques are woven by indigenous peoples today around the world. They produce such things as belts, ponchos, bags, hatbands and carrying cloths. Supplementary weft patterning and brocading is practiced in many regions. Balanced weaves are also possible on the backstrap loom. Today, commercially produced backstrap loom kits often include a rigid heddle.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Warp-weighted loom===
{{main|Warp-weighted loom}}
The [[warp-weighted loom]] is a vertical loom that may have originated in the [[Neolithic]] period. The earliest evidence of warp-weighted looms comes from sites belonging to the [[Starčevo culture]] in modern Serbia and Hungary and from late Neolithic sites in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barber|1991|pp.93–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; This loom was used in [[Ancient Greece]], and spread north and west throughout Europe thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowfoot| 1936| p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its defining characteristic is hanging weights (loom weights) which keep bundles of the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] threads taut. Frequently, extra warp thread is wound around the weights. When a weaver has reached the bottom of the available warp, the completed section can be rolled around the top beam, and additional lengths of warp threads can be unwound from the weights to continue. This frees the weaver from vertical size constraint.

===Drawloom===
A drawloom is a hand-loom for weaving figured cloth. In a drawloom, a "figure harness" is used to control each warp thread separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|1980|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; A drawloom requires two operators, the weaver and an assistant called a "drawboy" to manage the figure harness. The earliest confirmed drawloom fabrics come from the [[Chu (state)|State of Chu]] and date c. 400 BC.&lt;ref name="broudy 1979 124"&gt;Broudy (1979), 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars attribute the invention of the drawloom to the ancient Chinese, although some speculate an independent invention from ancient [[Syria]] since drawloom fabrics found in [[Dura-Europas]] are thought to date before 256 AD.&lt;ref name="broudy 1979 124"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forbes (1987), 218 &amp; 220.&lt;/ref&gt; The draw loom for patterned weaving was invented in ancient China during the Han Dynasty.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Explorations in the History of Machines and Mechanisms: Proceedings of HMM2012 (History of Mechanism and Machine Science) |last= Ceccarelli |first= Marco |last2=López-Cajún |first2=Carlos  |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |pages=219–220 |isbn=978-9400799448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese weavers and artisans used foot-powered multi-harness looms and jacquard looms for silk weaving and embroidery; both of which were cottage industries with imperial workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=A History of Mechanical Inventions |last= Payson Usher  |first= 	Abbott  |year=2011 |publisher= Dover Publications |page=54 |isbn=978-0486255934}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese-invented drawloom enhanced and sped up the production of silk and play a significant role in Chinese silk weaving. The loom was later introduced to Persia, India, and Europe.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[File:Traditional loom at Ranipauwa-Muktinath, Nepal-WLV-1197.jpg|thumb|Traditional loom at Ranipauwa Muktinath, Nepal]]
A handloom is a simple machine used for weaving. In a wooden vertical-shaft looms, the [[heddle]]s are fixed in place in the shaft. The warp threads pass alternately through a heddle, and through a space between the heddles (the [[shed (weaving)|shed]]), so that raising the shaft raises half the threads (those passing through the heddles), and lowering the shaft lowers the same threads — the threads passing through the spaces between the heddles remain in place. This was a great invention in the 13th century.

===Flying shuttle===
{{main|Flying shuttle}}
Hand weavers could only weave a cloth as wide as their armspan. If cloth needed to be wider, two people would do the task (often this would be an adult with a child). [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] (1704–1779) patented the [[flying shuttle]] in 1733. The weaver held a picking stick that was attached by cords to a device at both ends of the shed. With a flick of the wrist, one cord was pulled and the shuttle was propelled through the shed to the other end with considerable force, speed and efficiency. A flick in the opposite direction and the shuttle was propelled back. A single weaver had control of this motion but the flying shuttle could weave much wider fabric than an arm’s length at much greater speeds than had been achieved with the hand thrown shuttle.

The ''flying shuttle'' was one of the key developments in [[weaving]] that helped fuel the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The whole picking motion no longer relied on manual skill and it was just a matter of time before it could be powered.

===''Haute-lisse'' and ''basse-lisse'' looms===
Looms used for weaving traditional [[tapestry]] are classified as ''[[Warp (weaving)|haute-lisse]]'' looms, where the warp is suspended vertically between two rolls. In ''basse-lisse'' looms, however, the warp extends horizontally between the two rolls.

===Ribbon weaving===
{{main|Inkle weaving}}

===Traditional looms===
Several other types of hand looms exist, including the [[simple frame loom]], [[pit loom]], [[free-standing loom]], and the [[pegged loom]]. Each of these can be constructed, and provide work and income in developing economies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cd3wd.com/cd3wd_40/vita/handloom/en/handloom.htm Handlooms: Practical guide to constructing viable handlooms, Joan Koster,1978] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302081647/http://www.cd3wd.com/cd3wd_40/vita/handloom/en/handloom.htm |date=2014-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power looms==
{{Main|Power loom}}
[[File:QSMM Two Lancashire looms.ogg|thumb|Two Lancashire looms in the [[Queen Street Mill]] weaving shed, [[Burnley]]]]
[[File:Weben in der Tuchfabrik Müller.ogv|thumb|A 1939 loom working at the [[Mueller Cloth Mill]] museum in [[Euskirchen]], Germany.]]

[[Edmund Cartwright]] built and patented a [[power loom]] in 1785, and it was this that was adopted by the nascent cotton industry in England. The silk loom made by [[Jacques Vaucanson]] in 1745 operated on the same principles but was not developed further. The invention of the [[flying shuttle]] by [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] was critical to the development of a commercially successful power loom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marsden|1895|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright's loom was impractical but the ideas behind it were developed by numerous inventors in the Manchester area of England where, by 1818, there were 32 factories containing 5,732 looms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guest|1823|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Horrocks loom]] was viable, but it was the [[Roberts Loom]] in 1830 that marked the turning point.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marsden|1895|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incremental changes to the three motions continued to be made. The problems of sizing, stop-motions, consistent take-up, and a [[temple]] to maintain the width remained. In 1841, Kenworthy and [[Howard &amp; Bullough|Bullough]] produced the [[Lancashire Loom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marsden|1895|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was self-acting or semi-automatic. This enables a youngster to run six looms at the same time. Thus, for simple calicos, the power loom became more economical to run than the hand loom – with complex patterning that used a dobby or Jacquard head, jobs were still [[domestic system|put out]] to handloom weavers until the 1870s. Incremental changes were made such as the [[Dickinson Loom]], culminating in the [[Keighley]]-born inventor Northrop, who was working for the [[Draper Corporation]] in [[Hopedale, Massachusetts|Hopedale]] producing the fully automatic [[Northrop Loom]]. This loom recharged the shuttle when the [[pirn]] was empty. The Draper E and X models became the leading products from 1909. They were challenged by synthetic fibres such as [[rayon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mass|1990|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1942, faster, more efficient, and shuttleless [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer]] and [[rapier loom]]s had been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|1970|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern industrial looms can weave at 2,000 [[weft|weft insertion]]s per minute.&lt;ref name=Rajagopalan&gt;S.

===Weft insertion===
[[File:Greifer.JPG|thumb|A [[Picanol]] rapier loom]]
Different types of looms are most often defined by the way that the weft, or pick, is inserted into the warp. Many advances in weft insertion have been made in order to make manufactured cloth more cost effective. There are five main types of weft insertion and they are as follows:
* Shuttle: The first-ever powered looms were shuttle-type looms. Spools of weft are unravelled as the shuttle travels across the shed. This is very similar to projectile methods of weaving, except that the weft spool is stored on the shuttle. These looms are considered obsolete in modern industrial fabric manufacturing because they can only reach a maximum of 300 picks per minute.
* Air jet: An [[Air jet loom|air-jet loom]] uses short quick bursts of compressed air to propel the weft through the shed in order to complete the weave. Air jets are the fastest traditional method of weaving in modern manufacturing and they are able to achieve up to 1,500 picks per minute. However, the amounts of compressed air required to run these looms, as well as the complexity in the way the air jets are positioned, make them more costly than other looms. 
* Water jet: Water-jet looms use the same principle as air-jet looms, but they take advantage of pressurized water to propel the weft. The advantage of this type of weaving is that water power is cheaper where water is directly available on site. Picks per minute can reach as high as 1,000. 
* [[Rapier loom]]: This type of weaving is very versatile, in that rapier looms can weave using a large variety of threads.  There are several types of rapiers, but they all use a hook system attached to a rod or metal band to pass the pick across the shed. These machines regularly reach 700 picks per minute in normal production.
* Projectile: [[Projectile loom]]s utilize an object that is propelled across the shed, usually by spring power, and is guided across the width of the cloth by a series of reeds. The projectile is then removed from the weft fibre and it is returned to the opposite side of the machine so it can get reused. Multiple projectiles are in use in order to increase the pick speed. Maximum speeds on these machines can be as high as 1,050 ppm.

===Shedding===

====Dobby looms====
A [[dobby loom]] is a type of floor loom that controls the whole warp threads using a dobby head. Dobby is a corruption of "draw boy" which refers to the weaver's helpers who used to control the warp thread by pulling on draw threads. A dobby loom is an alternative to a treadle loom, where multiple heddles (shafts) were controlled by foot treadles – one for each heddle.

====Jacquard looms====
The '''Jacquard loom''' is a mechanical loom, invented by [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] in 1801, which simplifies the process of manufacturing [[textiles]] with complex patterns such as [[Brocade (fabric)|brocade]], [[damask]] and [[matelasse]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, "The Age of Revolution", (London 1962; repr. 2008), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christinalynn.com/fabric-glossary.shtml |title=Fabric Glossary |accessdate=2008-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105170019/http://www.christinalynn.com/fabric-glossary.shtml |archivedate=2009-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The loom is controlled by [[punched card]]s with punched holes, each row of which corresponds to one row of the design. Multiple rows of holes are punched on each card and the many cards that compose the design of the textile are strung together in order. It is based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen [[Basile Bouchon]] (1725), Jean Baptiste Falcon (1728) and [[Jacques Vaucanson]] (1740)&lt;ref&gt;[[#RAZY|C. Razy]] p.120 (1913)&lt;/ref&gt; To call it a loom is a misnomer, a Jacquard head could be attached to a power loom or a hand loom, the head controlling which warp thread was raised during shedding. Multiple shuttles could be used to control the colour of the weft during picking.  The Jacquard loom is the predecessor to the [[punch card computer]]s of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=GESELOWITZ|first1=MICHAEL N|title=The Jacquard Loom: A Driver of the Industrial Revolution|url=http://theinstitute.ieee.org/tech-history/technology-history/the-jacquard-loom-a-driver-of-the-industrial-revolution|publisher=The Institute: The IEEE news source|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circular looms==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Six shuttle circular loom machine.jpg|thumb|typical circular loom]] --&gt;
A circular loom is used to create a seamless tube of fabric for products such as hosiery, sacks, clothing, fabric hose (such as fire hose) and the like. Circular looms can be small jigs used for [[Circular knitting]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIA53WfVv04  You tube demonstration] access-date= 2016-06-27&lt;/ref&gt; or large high-speed machines for modern garments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starlinger.com/en/packaging/circular-looms/ High throughput Austrian manufacturer] access-date= 2016-06-27&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern circular looms use up to ten shuttles driven from below in a circular motion by electromagnets for the weft yarns, and cams to control the warp threads. The warps rise and fall with each shuttle passage, unlike the common practice of lifting all of them at once.

== Symbolism and cultural significance ==

The Loom is a symbol of cosmic creation and the structure upon which individual destiny is woven. This symbolism is encapsulated in the ancient Greek myth of Arachne who was changed into a spider by the goddess Athene, who was jealous of her skill at the godlike craft of weaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tresidder|first1=Jack|title=The Hutchinson Dictionary of Symbols|date=1997|publisher=Helicon Publishers|location=London|isbn=1-85986-059-1|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Maya Cultures the goddess Ixchel who is symbolized by the moon, taught the first woman how to weave at the beginning of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenbaum|first1=Brenda P.|title=Mayan Women, Weaving and Ethnic Identity: a Historical Essay|journal=Guatemala: Museo Ixchel del Traje Indigena|date=1990|pages=157–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics''' is a [[Max Planck Institute]], located in [[Garching bei München|Garching]], near [[Munich]], [[Germany]].
In 1991 the '''Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics''' split up into the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]] and the [[Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics]]. The Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics was founded as sub-institute in 1963. The
scientific activities of the institute are mostly devoted to astrophysics with telescopes orbiting in space. A large amount of the resources
are spent for studying black holes in the galaxy and in the remote universe.

== History ==

The Max-Planck-Institute for extraterrestrial physics (MPE) was preceded by the department for extraterrestrial physics in the Max-Planck-Institute for physics and astrophysics. This department was established by Professor Reimar Lüst on October 23, 1961. A Max-Planck Senate resolution transformed this department into a sub-institute of the Max-Planck-Institute for Physics and Astrophysics on May 15, 1963. Professor Lüst was appointed director of the Institute. Another Senate resolution on March 8, 1991 finally established MPE as an autonomous institute within the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft.

=== Detailed history ===
The Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik (MPE) was preceded by the department for extraterrestrial Physics in the Max-Planck-Institut für Physik und Astrophysik. This department was established by Professor Reimar Lüst on October 23, 1961. A Max-Planck Senate resolution transformed this department into a sub-institute of the Max-Planck-Institut für Physik und Astrophysik on May 15, 1963. Professor Lüst was appointed Director of the Institute. Another Senate resolution on March 8, 1991 finally established MPE as an autonomous institute within the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft. It is dedicated to the experimental and theoretical exploration of the space outside of earth as well as astrophysical phenomena. A continuous reorientation to new, promising fields of research and the appointment of new members ensures steady advancement.

Among the 29 employees of the Institute when it was founded in 1963 were 9 scientists and 1 Ph.D. student. Twelve years later in 1975 the number of employees had grown to 180 with 55 scientists and 13 Ph.D. students, and today (status 2015) there are some 400 staff (130 scientists and 75 PhD students). It is noteworthy that permanent positions at the institute have not increased since 1973 - despite its celebrated scientific achievements. The increasingly complex tasks and international obligations have been mainly maintained by staff members with positions having limited duration and funded by external organizations.

Because the Institute has assumed a leading position in astronomy internationally, it has attracted guest scientists throughout the world. The number of long-term guests increased from 12 in 1974 to a maximum of 72 in 2000. In recent years MPE has hosted an average of about 50 guest scientists each year.

During the early years, the scientific work at the Institute concentrated on the investigation of extraterrestrial plasmas and the magnetosphere of the earth. This work was performed with measurements of particles and electromagnetic fields as well as a specially developed ion-cloud technique using sounding rockets.

Another field of research also became important: astrophysical observations of electromagnetic radiation which could not be observed from the surface of the earth because the wavelengths are such that the radiation is absorbed by the earth's atmosphere. These observations and inferences therefrom are the subject matter of infra-red astronomy as well as X-ray- and gamma-ray-astronomy. In addition to more than 100 rockets, an increasing number of high-altitude balloons (up to now more than 50; e.g.  HEXE) have been used to carry experiments to high altitudes.

Since the 1990s, satellites have become the preferred observation platforms because of their favorable observation-time/cost ratio. Nevertheless, high-flying observation airplanes and ground-based telescopes are also used to obtain data, especially for optical and near-infrared observations.

New observation techniques using satellites has necessitated the recording, processing and accessible storage of high data fluxes over long periods of time. This demanding task is performed by a data processing group, which has grown quickly in the last decade. Special data centers were established for the large satellite projects.

Besides the many successes, there have also been disappointments. The malfunctioning of the Ariane carrier rockets on test launches in 1980 and 1996 were particularly bitter setbacks. The satellite  "Firewheel", in which many members of the Institute had invested years of work, was lost on May 23, 1980 because of a burning instability in the first stage of the launch rocket. The same fate was to overtake the four satellites of the CLUSTER-Mission on June 4, 1996 when the first Ariane 5 was launched. This time the disaster was attributed to an error in the rocket's software. The most recent loss was "ABRIXAS", an X-ray satellite built by industry under the leadership of MPE. After few hours in orbit, a malfunction of the power system caused the total loss of the satellite.

Over the years, however, the history of MPE is primarily a story of scientific successes.&lt;!-- http://www.mpe.mpg.de/576082/overview

The institute was founded in 1963 as a sub-institute of the Max-Planck-Institut für Physik und Astrophysik and established as an independent institute in 1991.
Its main research topics are astronomical observations in spectral regions which are only accessible from space because of the absorbing effects of the Earth's atmosphere, but also instruments on ground-based observatories are used whenever possible.
Scientific work is done in four major research areas that are supervised by one of the directors, respectively: optical and interpretative astronomy (Bender), infrared and sub-millimeter/millimeter astronomy (Genzel), high-energy astrophysics (Nandra), and in the Centre for Astrochemical Studies (Caselli). Within these areas scientists lead individual experiments and research projects organised in about 25 project teams. The research topics pursued at MPE range from the physics of cosmic plasmas and of stars to the physics and chemistry of interstellar matter, from star formation and nucleosynthesis to extragalactic astrophysics and cosmology.

Many experiments of the Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik (MPE) have to be carried out above the dense Earth's atmosphere using aircraft, rockets, satellites and space probes. In the early days experiments were also flown on balloons. To run advanced extraterrestrial physics and state-of-the-art experimental astrophysics, the institute continues to develop high-tech instrumentation in-house. This includes detectors, spectrometers, and cameras as well as telescopes and complete payloads (e.g. [[ROSAT]] and [[eROSITA]]) and even entire satellites (as in case of AMPTE and EQUATOR-S). For this purpose the technical and engineering departments are of particular importance for the institute's research work.

Observers and experimenters perform their research work at the institute in close contact with each other. Their interaction while interpreting observations and propounding new hypotheses underlies the successful progress of the institute's research projects.

At the end of the year 2009 a total of 487 employees were working at the institute, numbering among them 75 scientist, 95 junior scientists (45 IMPRS PhD students included), 97 externally funded positions and 64 visiting scientists and interns.

The MPE is also active in scientific and vocational training. At the end of 2009 6 students were working on their diploma thesis and 9 apprentices worked in the administration (1) and the institute's workshop (8).&lt;ref name="MPE: Sc.Work"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Work at the MPE|url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/profile.html#8|accessdate=13 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618214732/http://www.mpe.mpg.de/profile.html#8|archivedate=18 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==

Scientific projects at the MPE are often the efforts of the different research departments to build, maintain, and use experiments and facilities which are needed by the many different scientific research interest at the institute. Apart from hardware projects, there are also projects that use archival data and are not necessarily connected to a new instrument.

== Expansion Building ==

In the autumn of 2000 the new building was finished and occupied after a construction time of slightly over two years. Besides the office and laboratory space there is also a large seminar room with a capacity of approximately 200 people, and several small meeting rooms. It is also the first time in 15 years that all research groups of the institute are located in one common building.&lt;ref name="MPE: History" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7533">A '''model transformation''', in [[model-driven engineering]], is an automated way of modifying and creating models. An example use of model transformation is ensuring that a family of [[Computer model|model]]s is consistent, in a precise sense which the software engineer can define. The aim of using a model transformation is to save effort and reduce errors by automating the building and modification of models where possible.

== Overview ==
Model transformations can be thought of as programs that take models as input. There is a wide variety of kinds of model transformation and uses of them, which differ in their inputs and outputs and also in the way they are expressed.

A model transformation usually specifies which models are acceptable as input, and if appropriate what models it may produce as output, by specifying the [[Metamodeling|metamodel]] to which a model must conform.

== Classification of model transformations ==

Model transformations and languages for them have been classified in many ways.&lt;ref name="CzarneckiHelsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stevens-landscape"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jakumeit"/&gt;
Some of the more common distinctions drawn are:

=== Number and type of inputs and outputs ===

In principle a model transformation may have many inputs and outputs of various types; the only absolute limitation is that a model transformation will take at least one model as input. However, a model transformation that did not produce any model as output would more commonly be called a model analysis or model query.

=== Endogenous versus exogenous ===

Endogenous transformations are transformations between models expressed in the same language. Exogenous transformations are transformations between models expressed using different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mens, Pieter Van Gorp: A Taxonomy of Model Transformation. Electr. Notes Theor. Comput. Sci. 152: 125-142 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a process conforming to the [[Object Management Group|OMG]] [[Model Driven Architecture]], a [[platform-independent model]] might be transformed into a [[platform-specific model]] by an exogenous model transformation.

=== Unidirectional versus bidirectional ===

A unidirectional model transformation has only one mode of execution: that is, it always takes the same type of input and produces the same type of output.  Unidirectional model transformations are useful in compilation-like situations, where any output model is read-only. The relevant notion of consistency is then very simple: the input model is consistent with the model that the transformation would produce as output, only.

For a bidirectional model transformation, the same type of model can sometimes be input and other times be output. [[Bidirectional transformation]]s are necessary in situations where people are working on more than one model and the models must be kept consistent. Then a change to either model might necessitate a change to the other, in order to maintain consistency between the models. Because each model can incorporate information which is not reflected in the other, there may be many models which are consistent with a given model. Important special cases are:

*bijective transformations, in which there is exactly one model which is consistent with any given model; that is, the consistency relation is bijective. A pair of models is consistent if and only if it is related by the consistency bijection. Both models contain the same information, but presented differently.
*view transformations, in which a concrete model determines a single view model, but the same view model might be produced from many different concrete models. The view model is an abstraction of the concrete model. If the view may be updated, a bidirectional transformation is needed. This situation is known in the database field as [[View (database)|view-update]]. Any concrete model is consistent with its view.

It is particularly important that a bidirectional model transformation has appropriate properties to make it behave sensibly: for example, not making changes unnecessarily, or discarding deliberately made changes.&lt;ref name="Stevens-properties"/&gt;

== Languages for model transformations ==

{{Main|Model transformation language}}

A model transformation may be written in a general purpose programming language, but specialised model transformation languages are also available. Bidirectional transformations, in particular, are best written in a language that ensures the directions are appropriately related. The [[Object Management Group|OMG]]-standardised model transformation languages are collectively known as [[QVT]].

In some model transformation languages, for example the [[QVT]] languages, a model transformation is itself a model, that is, it conforms to a metamodel which is part of the model transformation language's definition. This facilitates the definition of '''Higher Order Transformation'''s (HOTs),&lt;ref name="Tisi"/&gt; i.e. transformations which have other transformations as input and/or output.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5041">'''Museum Planning''' is the creation of documents to describe a new [[museum]]’s vision, the visitor experience and an organizational plan for a new institution, or one undergoing a major expansion or change in focus.

[[Museum]] plans may include some or all of the following:
* A review of institutional resources, assets and [[Collection (museum)|collections]]
* A review of local attractions and museums
* A new or updated mission and vision
* [[Collection (museum)|Collections]] objectives of the new institution
* Educational objectives of the new institution
* Experience objectives of the new institution
* Potential visitor and other audience and user groups
* [[Interpretive planning|Interpretive Plan]]
* [[Exhibition]] storylines
* Visitor flow diagrams
* Thematic treatments
* Preliminary [[exhibition]] layout
* Style Boards
* Exhibition Renderings
* Space Needs Analysis
* [[Site selection]]
* Architectural Concepts
* Preliminary staffing plan
* Preliminary project schedule
* Preliminary project budget

Plans are created by a [[museum]] planning team, that includes; [[museum]] staff and volunteers, members of the [[board of directors]], community members, and representatives of city and state planning agencies working together with a museum planner, architects, exhibit designers, economists, and other specialist consultants. The objective of a [[Museum]] Plan is to create a clear and concise “road map” for the creation of new institution and a sustainable long term museum vision.

Museum planning may also refer to the designing of [[museum]] galleries, spaces, or new wings and buildings. The goal of a well-designed museum space is that it accents the collection, and puts the patron at ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAndrew|first=John|title=New Installations in the Metropolitan Museum|journal=College Art Association|date=Dec 1945|volume=27|issue=4|pages=260–265|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3047029?uid=3739896&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103385038211|accessdate=02/05/2014|doi=10.1080/00043079.1945.11407722}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many features of galleries that must be considered when organizing and planning a new space. Some of those aspects are '''circulation, density, lighting, backgrounds, arrangement, and labels.'''

The '''circulation''' of the space indicates the layout and direction of flow for visitors. This can be done by numbering objects, or the layout of displays. Poor circulation can result in the patron missing some galleries or displays or viewing objects in an order other than what the curator intended. Circulation should feel natural and logical; the patron may feel herded and become resentful.

'''Density, clarity, and emphasis''' are other aspects to consider when planning a new space. Galleries and individual objects should be placed so that everything appears to have equal value and importance. Then within displays, objects should not be overcrowded or cluttered. '''Lighting''' is extremely important and cannot be overlooked when planning new galleries. Natural light is ideal, but it must be filtered, and not too intense. It also should be consistent throughout the day – northern and southern exposure is ideal. 

'''Backgrounds''' can refer to a number of things: props, panels, or a simple painted wall can serve as a background to an object or display.  These must be subdued enough that they do not detract from the object on display, but they should be complimentary. The specific '''position, arrangement, and display''' of an object is important to consider. Height of the display case, order in which objects are placed or hung, and the grouping of certain objects are all major factors in how patrons interpret objects. 

'''[[Museum label]] and explanatory accessories''' are essential to a patron’s experience in a museum. Enough information should be provided that the patron feels as if they understand what they are looking at, but too much can bore or confuse the visitor. Some examples of these accessories are collection guides available for the overall museum experience, larger panels at the start of each gallery that can explain the intent of the collection, and smaller panels at each object should inform the viewer the object’s use, medium, creator, and dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAndrew|first=John|title=New Installations in the Metropolitan Museum|journal=College Art Association|date=Dec 1945|volume=27|issue=4|pages=260–265|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3047029?uid=3739896&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103385038211|accessdate=02/05/2014|doi=10.1080/00043079.1945.11407722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Wildlife Health Center''' (NWHC) is a science center of the [[United States Geological Survey]]. NWHC is located in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], on a 24-acre plot of land that includes a main building and tight isolation building (TIB). The facility houses [[Biosafety level 3|Bio-safety Level 3]] (BSL-3) and [[Biosafety level 2|Bio-safety Level 2]] (BSL-2) laboratories on site.

The center studies several diseases that affect American [[wildlife]] including [[bat]] [[white nose syndrome]], [[chronic wasting disease]] (CWD), [[avian influenza]], and [[sylvatic plague]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/ |title=USGS National Wildlife Health Center - Disease Information |publisher=Nwhc.usgs.gov |date=May 19, 2016 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the study of disease, NWHC has the capability to diagnose the causes of mass wildlife die-offs.  This is done via [[necropsy]] and the work of several [[pathologist]]s, [[biologists]], and other scientists.  The scientists are able to run [[toxicology]], [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] analyses to determine cause of death.  A notable instance of this capability in use was during the mass die-off of birds, primarily [[red-winged blackbird]]s, in [[Beebe, Arkansas]], on December 31, 2010. The NWHC determined the die-off to be the result of blunt trauma, most likely caused when the birds were frightened out of their nests at night by fireworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bergquist |first=Lee |url=http://archive.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/113018024.html |title=Madison lab solves mystery of Arkansas bird die-off |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=January 6, 2011 |accessdate=October 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honolulu Field Station ==
In addition to the main facility in Madison, Wisconsin, the NWHC maintains a field station in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]].  The Honolulu field station is responsible for researching diseases that effect Pacific Ocean wildlife, including birds, [[sea turtle]]s, and [[coral reef]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/hfs/Projects.jsp |title=USGS National Wildlife Health Center - Honolulu Projects |publisher=Nwhc.usgs.gov |date=2016-05-19 |accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally staff for the NWHC Honolulu field station numbers around four staff, either federal employees or contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/hfs/Staff.jsp |title=USGS National Wildlife Health Center - Honolulu Staff |publisher=Nwhc.usgs.gov |date=2016-05-19 |accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7959">'''The Nordic Gender Institute (NIKK)''' (''Norwegian: Nordisk institutt for kunnskap om kjønn''), previously ''Nordic Institute for Women's Studies and Gender Research'', was a transnational resource and information centre for gender research and gender equality in the [[Nordic countries]]. 

The Institute aimed at constituting a bridge between Nordic gender research and equality politics. It co-operated closely with the Nordic Ministers for Co-operation on Gender Equality and the Nordic Executive Committee on Gender Equality. It claimed to contribute to the implementation of the Nordic cooperation programme on gender equality: "Focus on Gender: Working toward an Equal Society" (2006-2010). It initiated projects with the goal of gender equality, and coordinated and carried out investigations, studies, surveys, reports and opinions.

The Institute was located at the [[University of Oslo]] in Norway. It employed research coordinators, researchers, information advisors, and administrative personnel &amp;ndash; in 2010 the staff consisted of six employees from four of the Nordic countries.

== Reorganizing ==
In 2011, the Nordic Council of Ministers decided to reorganize NIKK, from a Nordic institute to a Nordic co-operation programme. A bidding round was announced in 2012. The co-operation programme was to further develop the information function, administer a Nordic funding scheme for gender equality and serve as project secretariat. The University of Gothenburg and the Swedish Secretariat for Gender Research won the bidding. 

Nordic Information on Gender, NIKK, was established in late 2012 and the programme's assignment expires at the end of 2015. As the acronym NIKK is established in the Nordic region and beyond, and associated with information, research and knowledge related to gender and gender equality, the Nordic co-operation programme continues to use NIKK.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nikk.no/en/about-nikk/background-to-the-nordic-cooperation-and-nikk/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact of ''Hjernevask'' ===
{{Disputed-section|date=July 2014}} 

Certain journalists{{who|date=August 2014}} have speculated about the decision to restructure NIKK, and its relation to the public debate that followed the seven-part television documentary series "[[Hjernevask]]" ('Brainwash'), by the comedian and documentarian [[Harald Eia]], which aired in spring 2010 on the Norwegian broadcasting service NRK. However, the Norwegian Research Council has denied that the programme had any influence on its decision not to renew the Norwegian research programme on gender in 2011.{{cn|date=April 2017}} 

The gender researcher Marit Aure speculates, however, that the discussions on gender research, following the programme, might have influenced the decision indirectly, by presenting gender research in Norway as a more established field than actually was the case. Anders Hanneborg, involved in the Norwegian Research Council's committee that evaluated the Norwegian gender research programme's renewal application, explained that the programme was not renewed in order to decentralize and strengthen gender research in Norway. He also denied directly that the television programme "Hjernevask" was any part of their discussions on the issue. The Norwegian research programme on gender had received funding in 2008 for a period of four years, which expired in 2011. The Norwegian research programme, funded by the Norwegian Research Council, was not related to NIKK, which was funded by the Nordic Council of Ministers.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.svd.se/opinion/ledarsidan/hur-gar-det-for-norge-utan-genusvetenskap_6687272.svd |title=Hur går det för Norge utan genusvetenskap? |author=Ledare Johan Ingerö |publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |date=2011-12-06 |access-date=2012-08-31 |language=sv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/Kjnnsforskningen-mister-56-millioner-6704899.html |title=Kjønnsforskningen mister 56 millioner |author=Kjersti Nipen |publisher=[[Aftenposten]] |date=2011-11-23 |access-date=2012-08-31 |language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norwegian Parliament, responding to a direct question from Tord Lien of the rightist Progress Party, addressed these television programmes. The core of his criticism concerned the scientific neglect of the biological to the social component. The Minister of Research and Higher Education, Tora Aasland, from the Socialist Leftist Party, dismissed these criticisms, adding that multidisciplinary gender research in Norway has been evaluated positively, not by television programmes, but through external scientific evaluations of Norwegian research on the field&lt;ref name="Stortinget1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Stortinget - Møte onsdag den 28. april 2010 kl. 10 |publisher=[[Stortinget]]|url=http://www.stortinget.no/no/Saker-og-publikasjoner/Publikasjoner/Referater/Stortinget/2009-2010/100428/ordinarsporretime/16/ |date=2010-04-28 |access-date=2012-09-01 |language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stortinget2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Stortinget - Møte tirsdag den 8. juni 2010 kl. 10 |publisher=[[Stortinget]]|url=http://www.stortinget.no/no/Saker-og-publikasjoner/Publikasjoner/Referater/Stortinget/2009-2010/100608/8/ |date=2010-06-08 |access-date=2012-09-01 |language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian network for Gender Studies states correlations between  "Hjernevask" and increased discussion on the gender studies in its Annual report 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uis.no/getfile.php/genderresearch/%C3%A5rsrapport%20NFK%202010%201.pdf |title=Årsrapport NFK 2010 |publisher=Nettverk for kjønnsforskning |pages=3 |access-date=2012-08-31 |language=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==

The Nordic Gender Institute initiated, co-ordinated, and executed projects that focus on central gender equality issues, i.e. research and development, statements, surveys, and reports. The most recent projects are:

* Gender and Power in the Nordic Countries (2008-2009)
* Gendered Citizenship in Multicultural Europe: The Impact of Contemporary Women's Movements (FEMCIT) (2007-2011)
* Prostitution in the Nordic Countries (2007-2008)
* Multidimensional Discrimination Policies in the Nordic Countries (2007)
* Gender Equality and Quality of Life. A Norwegian Perspective (2007)
* Youth, Gender and Pornography in the Nordic Countries (2004-2006)

A large NIKK study on [[prostitution]] for the Nordic ministers of gender equality was presented in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytid.no/perspektiver/artikler/20081017/blank/|title=Sexkjøpforbud kan bli sovepute|last=Stackpole Dahl|first=Miriam|date=2008-10-17|publisher=[[Ny Tid]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2009-01-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022043927/http://www.nytid.no/perspektiver/artikler/20081017/blank/|archivedate=2008-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?a=840915|title=Bland liljor och rhododendronbuskar|last=Bjurwald|first=Lisa|date=2008-10-17|publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study on gender and power was presented in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gp.se/ekonomi/1.252763-fa-kvinnor-i-styrelser|title=Få kvinnor i styrelser|last=Björk|first=Evalis|date=2009-11-19|publisher=[[Göteborgs-Posten]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Magazine ==

''NIKK magasin'' wrote about new and current themes and perspectives on gender research and gender equality politics in the Nordic countries. It was published three times a year: two issues in Scandinavian languages &amp;ndash; one issue in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nikk.no/en/nordic-cooperation/themes-1996-2011/|title=NIKK magasin|publisher=NIKK|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7858">{{canon law}}
A '''notary in the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]''' of the [[Catholic Church]] ([[ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: ''notarius'') is a person appointed by competent authority to draw up official or authentic documents. These documents are issued chiefly from the official administrative bureaux, the chanceries; secondly, from tribunals; lastly, others are drawn up at the request of individuals to authenticate their contracts or other acts. The public officials appointed to draw up these three classes of papers have been usually called notaries.

==Etymology==
Etymologically, a notary is one who takes notes. Notes are signs or cursory abbreviations to record the words uttered, so that they may be reproduced later in ordinary writing. Notaries were at first private secretaries, attached to the service of persons in positions of importance. It was natural for the science of notes to be in high esteem among those employed in recording the transactions of public boards, and for the name notary to be applied to these officials; so that before long the word was used to signify their occupation.

==History==
{{see also|Legal history of the Catholic Church}}
The title and office existed at the Imperial Court (cf. Cod. Theod., VI, 16, "De primicerio et notariis"), whence they passed into all the royal chanceries, though in the course of time the term notary ceased to be used. This was the case also with the chanceries of the pope, the great episcopal sees, and even every bishopric.

There are grounds for doubting whether the seven regional notaries of the Roman Church, one for each ecclesiastical district of the Holy City, were instituted by St. Clement and appointed by him to record the Acts of the martyrs, as is said in the "Liber Pontificalis";&lt;ref&gt;"Vita Clementis", ed. Duchesne, I, 123&lt;/ref&gt; they date back, however, to an early age.

==''Primicerius'' and ''secundicerius''==
Not only were there notaries as soon as a bureau for ecclesiastical documents was established, but in very ancient days we find these notaries forming a kind of college presided over by a ''primicerius''; the notice of [[Pope Julius I]] in the "Liber Pontificalis" relates that this pope ordered an account of the property of the Church, intended as an authentic document, to be drawn up before the ''primicerius'' of the notaries.

The notaries were in the ranks of the clergy and must have received one of the minor orders; for the notariate is an office and not an order. At intervals the popes entrusted the notaries of their ''curia'' with various missions. Their chief, the ''primicerius'', with whom a ''secundicerius'' is sometimes found later, was a very important personage, in fact, the head of the [[Apostolic Chancery|pontifical chancery]]; during the vacancy of the papal chair, he formed part of the interim Government, and a letter in 640 (Jaffé, "Regesta", n. 2040) is signed (the pope being elected but not yet consecrated) by one "Joannes primicerius et servans locum s. sedis apostolicae".

==Protonotary Apostolic==
{{main|Protonotary Apostolic}}
There were of course many notaries in the service of the pontifical chancery; the seven regional notaries preserved a certain pre-eminence over the others and became the protonotary (also spelled "prothonotaries"), whose name and office continued. The ordinary notaries of the chancery, however, were gradually known by other names, according to their various functions, so that the term ceased to be employed in the pontifical and other chanceries. The prothonotaries were and still are a college of prelates, enjoying numerous privileges; they are known as "participants", but outside of Rome there are many purely honorary prothonotaries. The official duties had insensibly almost ceased; but Pius X in his reorganization of the Roman Curia has appointed participant prothonotaries to the chancery (Const. "Sapienti", 29 June 1908). A corresponding change occurred in the bureaux of the episcopal churches, abbeys, etc.; the officials attached to the chancery have ceased to be known as notaries and are called chancellor, secretary, etc. Lastly, mention must be made of the notaries of the synodal or conciliar assemblies, whose duties are limited to the duration of the assembly.

==Notaries of canonical tribunals==
Society in former times did not recognize the separation of powers; so, too, in the Church the judicial authority was vested in the same prelates as the administrative. Soon, however, contentious matters were tried separately before a specially appointed body.

The courts required a staff to record the transactions; these clerks were likewise notaries. In most civil courts they are, however, called registrars, clerks of the court, etc., but in the ecclesiastical tribunals they retain the name notary, though they are also called '''"actuaries"'''.

Thus the special law of the higher [[ecclesiastical tribunals]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;can. v and xxxv&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tribunal of the Roman Rota]] and the [[Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura]], reorganized by [[Pope Pius X|St. Pius X]], provides for the appointment of notaries for these two tribunals. The reason why the head official charged with drawing up the documents of the [[Holy Office]] is called the notary, as were the clerks who in former times drew up the records of the [[Inquisition]], is, doubtless, that of all the [[Roman Congregations]] the [[Holy Office]] is the only real judicial tribunal.

The notaries of ecclesiastical tribunals are usually clerics; the duties may however be confided to laymen, except in criminal cases against a cleric.

==Public notaries==
Finally, there is the class of persons to whom the term notary is restricted in common parlance, to wit, those who are appointed by the proper authorities to witness the documentary proceedings between private persons and to impress them with legal authenticity. They are not engaged in the chanceries, in order that they may be within easy reach of private individuals; they have a public character, so that their records, drawn up according to rule, are received as authentic accounts of the particular transaction, especially agreements, contracts, testaments, and wills.

Consequently, public notaries may be appointed only by those authorities who possess jurisdiction ''in foro externo'', and have a chancery, e.g. popes, bishops, emperors, reigning princes, and of course only within the limits of their jurisdiction; moreover, the territory within which a notary can lawfully exercise his functions is expressly determined. There were formerly Apostolic notaries and even episcopal notaries, duly commissioned by papal or episcopal letters, whose duty it was to receive documents relating to ecclesiastical or mixed affairs, especially in connection with benefices, foundations, and donations in favor of churches, wills of clerics, etc. They no longer exist; the only ecclesiastical notaries at present are the officials of the Roman and episcopal ''curiae''. Moreover, these notaries were layman, and [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] forbids clerics to acts as scriveners.&lt;ref group=note&gt;c. viii, "Ne clerici vel monachi", 1.

The '''Petroleum University of Technology''' ({{lang-fa|دانشگاه صنعت نفت}}) is a leading Iranian [[Public university|public]] university funded by the [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)|Ministry of Petroleum]] particularly by its main company, the [[National Iranian Oil Company|NIOC]] . It was  founded in 1939 in [[Abadan]] in response to the increasing industrialization of Iran oil company, and is officially the second oldest university in Iran after [[University of Tehran]]&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt; and based on The Center for World University Rankings (CWUR), this university has the 7th worldwide rank in oil an gas sector and petroleum engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{https://cwur.org/2017/subjects.php#Engineering, Petroleum}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source|sure=n|reason=Reference is not a reliable website and there is no prove for the claim there.|date=September 2017}} It offers [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]], [[Master of Science|M.S]] and [[Doctorate]] programs for upstream and downstream oil and gas industry such as [[petroleum engineering]], [[chemical engineering]],  [[offshore  engineering]],  [[instrumentation engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[accounting]], and [[marine engineering]].

It has four campuses in [[Ahwaz]], [[Abadan]], [[Tehran]] and [[Mahmudabad, Mazandaran|Mahmudabad]] and some research centers.

== History ==
[[File:نمای ورود دانشکده.jpg|thumb|Ahwaz Petroleum University of Technology]]

[[File:Abadan Petroleum University.jpg|thumb|Abadan Institute of Technology in 1939]]
The name of the university has been changed several times. The university was established in 1939 in [[Abadan]] as '''Abadan Technical School'''. The academic program comprised working and studying in sequence. The students (if employed) spent two-fifth of the academic program in the school and three-fifth in the '''Abadan Refinery''' ({{lang-fa|پالايشگاه آبادان}} ''Pālāyeshgāh-e Ābādān'') as trainees.&lt;ref name="put history"/&gt;

In 1956, the name was changed to '''Abadan Technical College'''. By then, the educational program focused on the general engineering major; admissions were given to 4th grade high school students after passing an entry test and interviews. The last admissions of the program were granted in 1961 and the last students graduated in 1961.&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

In 1962, the name changed to  '''Abadan Institute of Technology''' (AIT). The programs offered [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degrees in petroleum engineering, economic and administrative sciences and accounting. The programs was still internship-orientated.&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

After the outbreak of the [[Iran–Iraq War|War]], the university was relocated. It was first moved to [[Gachsaran County|Gachsaran]] in 1981. The universities all over the country reopened in December 1982 and the university moved to the current location of Ahwaz Faculty of Petroleum in [[Kut-e Abdollah]], [[Karun, Khuzestan|Karun County]].&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

After the [[Iran–Iraq War|War]], in 1989, the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education granted permission to found the Petroleum University of Technology. All the educational institutions of the [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)|Ministry of Petroleum]] are supervised by the university. [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)|Ministry of Petroleum]], then founded the '''Abadan Shahid Tondghuyan Faculty of Chemical and Petrochemical Engineering''' or Abadan Faculty of Petroleum in {{date|February 1992}} in the location of the former Abadan Institute of Technology and The Research Center of Petroleum University of Technology in the campus of the current Ahwaz Faculty of Petroleum in 1993.&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

== Today==
As of 2015, the Petroleum University of Technology consists of four faculties in cities that offer 13 [[undergraduate]], 11 [[graduate school|graduate]] and three [[doctorate]] programs:
* Ahwaz Faculty of Petroleum (or PUT Ahwaz), 
* Abadan Faculty of Petroleum (or PUT Abadan),
* Tehran Faculty of Petroleum ([[N.I.O.C. school of Accounting and Finance ]]) (or PUT Tehran),
* [[Mahmudabad, Mazandaran|Mahmudabad]] Faculty of Marine Sciences (or PUT Mahmudabad).&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

The university has four research centers:
* Ahwaz Faculty of Petroleum Research Center;
* Abadan Faculty of Petroleum Research Center;
* Tehran Faculty of Petroleum Research Center and,
* Mahmudabad Faculty of Marine Sciences Offshore Oil &amp; Gas Industries Research Center.&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

==Roles and goals==
The priorities of the PUT are maintaining the resources of oil and gas in the country and training manpower for the development and exploitation of these resources.

== Students ==
According to the results of M.S. [[Iranian University Entrance Exam|Entrance Examinations]], PUT students are the best among other universities like [[Sharif University of Technology]] and [[Amirkabir University of Technology]] in Petroleum and Chemical Engineering, and Accounting . The university has sent some of its students to the  [[University of Calgary]], [[Curtin University of Technology]] and [[French Institute of Petroleum]] (IFP).

A student has won the bronze medal of the 9th South Eastern European Mathematical Olympiad for University Students (SEEMOUS 2015) that took place in [[Ohrid]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], from March 3–8, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=افتخارآفرینی دانشجوی دانشگاه صنعت نفت در المپیاد جهانی ریاضی|url=http://www.shana.ir/fa/newsagency/236898/%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A2%D9%81%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%AC%D9%88%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%AA-%D9%86%D9%81%D8%AA-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AC%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B6%DB%8C|accessdate=13 September 2015|work=شبکه اطلاع‌رسایی نفت و انرژی|agency=شانا|date=March 10, 2015|language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38436">'''Radiometric dating''' or '''radioactive dating''' is a technique used to [[Chronological dating|date]] materials such as [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] or [[carbon]], in which trace radioactive [[impurity|impurities]] were selectively incorporated when they were  formed. The method compares the abundance of a naturally occurring [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotope]] within the material to the abundance of its [[Radioactive decay|decay]] products, which form at a known constant rate of decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=radioactive dating|file=R05082}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of radiometric dating was first published in 1907 by [[Bertram Boltwood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Boltwood, Bertram | year = 1907 | title = The Ultimate Disintegration Products of the Radio-active Elements. Part II. The disintegration products of uranium | journal = American Journal of Science | series = 4 | volume = 23 | issue = 134 | pages = 77–88 | doi=10.2475/ajs.s4-23.134.78}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now the principal source of information about the [[Absolute dating|absolute age]] of rocks and other [[Geology|geological features]], including the age of [[Paleontology|fossilized life forms]] or the [[age of the Earth]] itself, and can also be used to date a wide range of natural and [[Artifact (archaeology)|man-made materials]].

Together with [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic principles]], radiometric dating methods are used in [[geochronology]] to establish the [[geologic time scale]].&lt;ref&gt;McRae, A. 1998. ''Radiometric Dating and the Geological Time Scale: Circular Reasoning or Reliable Tools?'' [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dating.html Radiometric Dating and the Geological Time Scale [[TalkOrigins Archive]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the best-known techniques are [[radiocarbon dating]], [[potassium–argon dating]] and [[uranium–lead dating]]. By allowing the establishment of geological timescales, it provides a significant source of information about the ages of [[fossil]]s and the deduced rates of [[evolution]]ary change. Radiometric dating is also used to date [[archaeology|archaeological]] materials, including ancient artifacts.

Different methods of radiometric dating vary in the timescale over which they are accurate and the materials to which they can be applied.

==Fundamentals==

===Radioactive decay===
[[Image:Thorium decay chain from lead-212 to lead-208.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Example of a radioactive [[decay chain]] from lead-212 (&lt;sup&gt;212&lt;/sup&gt;Pb) to lead-208 (&lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb) . Each parent nuclide spontaneously decays into a daughter nuclide (the [[decay product]]) via an [[alpha decay|α decay]] or a [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay]]. The final decay product, lead-208 (&lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb), is stable and can no longer undergo spontaneous radioactive decay.]]
All ordinary [[matter]] is made up of combinations of [[chemical element]]s, each with its own [[atomic number]], indicating the number of [[proton]]s in the [[atomic nucleus]]. Additionally, elements may exist in different [[isotope]]s, with each isotope of an element differing in the number of [[neutron]]s in the nucleus. A particular isotope of a particular element is called a [[nuclide]]. Some nuclides are inherently unstable. That is, at some point in time, an atom of such a nuclide will undergo [[radioactive decay]] and spontaneously transform into a different nuclide. This transformation may be accomplished in a number of different ways, including [[alpha decay]] (emission of [[alpha particle]]s) and [[beta decay]] ([[electron]] emission, [[positron]] emission, or [[electron capture]]). Another possibility is [[spontaneous fission]] into two or more nuclides.

While the moment in time at which a particular nucleus decays is unpredictable, a collection of atoms of a radioactive nuclide decays [[exponential decay|exponentially]] at a rate described by a parameter known as the [[half-life]], usually given in units of years when discussing dating techniques. After one half-life has elapsed, one half of the atoms of the nuclide in question will have decayed into a "daughter" nuclide or [[decay product]]. In many cases, the daughter nuclide itself is radioactive, resulting in a [[decay chain]], eventually ending with the formation of a stable (nonradioactive) daughter nuclide; each step in such a chain is characterized by a distinct half-life. In these cases, usually the half-life of interest in radiometric dating is the longest one in the chain, which is the rate-limiting factor in the ultimate transformation of the radioactive nuclide into its stable daughter. Isotopic systems that have been exploited for radiometric dating have half-lives ranging from only about 10 years (e.g., [[tritium]]) to over 100 billion years (e.g., [[samarium-147]]).&lt;ref name="Bernard-Griffiths1989"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernard-Griffiths|first1=J.|last2=Groan|first2=G.|editor1-last=Roth|editor1-first=Etienne|editor2-last=Poty|editor2-first=Bernard|title=Nuclear Methods of Dating|date=1989|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-0-7923-0188-2|pages=53 – 72|chapter=The samarium–neodymium method}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most radioactive nuclides, the half-life depends solely on nuclear properties and is essentially a constant. It is not affected by external factors such as [[temperature]], [[pressure]], chemical environment, or presence of a [[magnetic field|magnetic]] or [[electric field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.ns.22.120172.001121 |title=Perturbation of Nuclear Decay Rates |year=1972 |author=Emery, G T |journal=Annual Review of Nuclear Science |volume=22|issue=1 |pages=165–202|bibcode = 1972ARNPS..22..165E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/264340a0 |title=Direct test of the constancy of fundamental nuclear constants |year=1976 |author=Shlyakhter, A.

''How to Change Nuclear Decay Rates'' [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/decay_rates.html Usenet Physics FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The only exceptions are nuclides that decay by the process of electron capture, such as [[beryllium-7]], [[strontium-85]], and [[zirconium-89]], whose decay rate may be affected by local electron density. For all other nuclides, the proportion of the original nuclide to its decay products changes in a predictable way as the original nuclide decays over time. This predictability allows the relative abundances of related nuclides to be used as a [[clock]] to measure the time from the incorporation of the original nuclides into a material to the present.

===Accuracy of radiometric dating===
[[Image:Thermal ionization mass spectrometer.jpg|thumb|[[Thermal ionization mass spectrometer]] used in radiometric dating.]]
The basic equation of radiometric dating requires that neither the parent nuclide nor the daughter product can enter or leave the material after its formation. The possible confounding effects of contamination of parent and daughter isotopes have to be considered, as do the effects of any loss or gain of such isotopes since the sample was created. It is therefore essential to have as much information as possible about the material being dated and to check for possible signs of [[Metasomatism|alteration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/0012-821X(96)00132-X |title=3-D, &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar---&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Ar geochronology in the Paraná continental flood basalt province |year=1996 |author=Stewart, K,, Turner, S, Kelley, S, Hawkesworh, C Kristein, L and Manotvani, M |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=143|issue=1–4 |pages=95–109 |bibcode=1996E&amp;PSL.143...95S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precision is enhanced if measurements are taken on multiple samples from different locations of the rock body. Alternatively, if several different minerals can be dated from the same sample and are assumed to be formed by the same event and were in equilibrium with the reservoir when they formed, they should form an [[isochron dating|isochron]]. This can reduce the problem of [[contamination]]. In [[uranium–lead dating]], the [[concordia diagram]] is used which also decreases the problem of nuclide loss. Finally, correlation between different isotopic dating methods may be required to confirm the age of a sample. For example, the age of the Amitsoq [[gneiss]]es from western [[Greenland]] was determined to be {{Ma|3.60|million years ago (MA)|error=0.05|round=2}} using uranium–lead dating and {{Ma|3.56|Ma|error=0.10|round=2}} using lead–lead dating, results that are consistent with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalrymple|first1=G. Brent|title=The age of the earth|date=1994|publisher=Stanford Univ. Press|location=Stanford, Calif.|isbn=9780804723312}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|142&amp;ndash;143}}

Accurate radiometric dating generally requires that the parent has a long enough half-life that it will be present in significant amounts at the time of measurement (except as described below under "Dating with short-lived extinct radionuclides"), the half-life of the parent is accurately known, and enough of the daughter product is produced to be accurately measured and distinguished from the initial amount of the daughter present in the material. The procedures used to isolate and analyze the parent and daughter nuclides must be precise and accurate. This normally involves [[isotope-ratio mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dickin|first1=Alan P.|title=Radiogenic isotope geology|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521530170|pages=15&amp;ndash;49|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precision of a dating method depends in part on the half-life of the radioactive isotope involved. For instance, carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years. After an organism has been dead for 60,000 years, so little carbon-14 is left that accurate dating cannot be established. On the other hand, the concentration of carbon-14 falls off so steeply that the age of relatively young remains can be determined precisely to within a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Closure temperature===
{{Main article|Closure temperature}}

If a material that selectively rejects the daughter nuclide is heated, any daughter nuclides that have been accumulated over time will be lost through [[diffusion]], setting the isotopic "clock" to zero. The temperature at which this happens is known as the [[closure temperature]] or blocking temperature and is specific to a particular material and isotopic system. These temperatures are experimentally determined in the lab by [[Petrology#Branches|artificially resetting sample minerals]] using a high-temperature furnace. As the mineral cools, the crystal structure begins to form and diffusion of isotopes is less easy. At a certain temperature, the crystal structure has formed sufficiently to prevent diffusion of isotopes. This temperature is what is known as closure temperature and represents the temperature below which the mineral is a closed system to isotopes. Thus an igneous or metamorphic rock or melt, which is slowly cooling, does not begin to exhibit measurable radioactive decay until it cools below the closure temperature. The age that can be calculated by radiometric dating is thus the time at which the rock or mineral cooled to closure temperature.&lt;ref name=Faure&gt;{{Cite book|first=Gunter |last=Faure |title=Principles and applications of geochemistry: a comprehensive textbook for geology students |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=[[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]] |year=1998 |pages= |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-02-336450-1 |oclc=37783103}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rollinson&gt;{{Cite book|first=Hugh R. |last=Rollinson |title=Using geochemical data: evaluation, presentation, interpretation |publisher=[[Longman]] |location=[[Harlow]] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=978-0-582-06701-1 |oclc=27937350}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dating of different minerals and/or isotope systems (with differing closure temperatures) within the same rock can therefore enable the tracking of the thermal history of the rock in question with time, and thus the history of metamorphic events may become known in detail. This field is known as [[thermochronology]] or thermochronometry.

==Modern dating methods==
Radiometric dating has been carried out since 1905 when it was [[Age of the Earth#Invention of radiometric dating|invented]] by [[Ernest Rutherford]] as a method by which one might determine the [[age of the Earth]]. In the century since then the techniques have been greatly improved and expanded.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt; Dating can now be performed on samples as small as a nanogram using a [[mass spectrometer]]. The mass spectrometer was invented in the 1940s and began to be used in radiometric dating in the 1950s. It operates by generating a beam of [[ion|ionized atoms]] from the sample under test. The ions then travel through a magnetic field, which diverts them into different sampling sensors, known as "[[Faraday cup]]s", depending on their mass and level of ionization. On impact in the cups, the ions set up a very weak current that can be measured to determine the rate of impacts and the relative concentrations of different atoms in the beams.

[[Uranium–lead radiometric dating]] involves using uranium-235 or uranium-238 to date a substance's absolute age. This scheme has been refined to the point that the error margin in dates of rocks can be as low as less than two million years in two-and-a-half billion years.&lt;ref name=Oberthuer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2004.12.003 |title=The age and petrology of the Chimbadzi Hill Intrusion, NW Zimbabwe: first evidence for early Paleoproterozoic magmatism in Zimbabwe |year=2004 |first=Tawanda D. |last=Manyeruke |author2=Thomas G.

Uranium–lead dating is often performed on the [[mineral]] [[zircon]] (ZrSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), though it can be used on other materials, such as [[baddeleyite]], as well as [[monazite]] (see: [[monazite geochronology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2113/104.1.13 |title=SHRIMP baddeleyite and zircon ages for an Umkondo dolerite sill, Nyanga Mountains, Eastern Zimbabwe |year=2001 |first=M.T.D. |last=Wingate |journal=South African Journal of Geology |volume=104|issue=1 |pages=13–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zircon and baddeleyite incorporate uranium atoms into their crystalline structure as substitutes for [[zirconium]], but strongly reject lead. Zircon has a very high closure temperature, is resistant to mechanical weathering and is very chemically inert. Zircon also forms multiple crystal layers during metamorphic events, which each may record an isotopic age of the event. ''In situ'' micro-beam analysis can be achieved via laser [[ICP-MS]] or [[Secondary ion mass spectrometry|SIMS]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.286.5448.2289 |title=Isotope Geochemistry: New Tools for Isotopic Analysis |date=December 1999 |first=Trevor |last=Ireland |journal=Science |volume=286 |issue=5448 |pages=2289–2290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of its great advantages is that any sample provides two clocks, one based on uranium-235's decay to lead-207 with a half-life of about 700 million years, and one based on uranium-238's decay to lead-206 with a half-life of about 4.5 billion years, providing a built-in crosscheck that allows accurate determination of the age of the sample even if some of the lead has been lost. This can be seen in the concordia diagram, where the samples plot along an errorchron (straight line) which intersects the concordia curve at the age of the sample.

{{Main article|Samarium–neodymium dating}}

This involves the [[alpha decay]] of &lt;sup&gt;147&lt;/sup&gt;Sm to &lt;sup&gt;143&lt;/sup&gt;Nd with a [[half-life]] of 1.06 x 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; years.

===Potassium–argon dating method===
{{Main article|Potassium–argon dating}}

This involves [[electron capture]] or [[positron]] decay of potassium-40 to argon-40. Potassium-40 has a half-life of 1.3 billion years, and so this method is applicable to the oldest rocks. Radioactive potassium-40 is common in [[mica]]s, [[feldspar]]s, and [[hornblende]]s, though the closure temperature is fairly low in these materials, about 350&amp;nbsp;°C (mica) to 500&amp;nbsp;°C (hornblende).

===Rubidium–strontium dating method===
{{Main article|Rubidium–strontium dating}}

This is based on the beta decay of [[rubidium-87]] to [[strontium-87]], with a half-life of 50 billion years. This scheme is used to date old [[igneous rock|igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s, and has also been used to date [[moon rock|lunar samples]]. Closure temperatures are so high that they are not a concern. Rubidium-strontium dating is not as precise as the uranium-lead method, with errors of 30 to 50 million years for a 3-billion-year-old sample.

===Uranium–thorium dating method===
{{Main article|Uranium–thorium dating}}

A relatively short-range dating technique is based on the decay of uranium-234 into thorium-230, a substance with a half-life of about 80,000 years. It is accompanied by a sister process, in which uranium-235 decays into protactinium-231, which has a half-life of 32,760 years.

While [[uranium]] is water-soluble, [[thorium]] and [[protactinium]] are not, and so they are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor [[sediment]]s, from which their ratios are measured. The scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years. A related method is [[ionium–thorium dating]], which measures the ratio of [[ionium]] (thorium-230) to thorium-232 in ocean sediment.

===Radiocarbon dating method===
{{Main article|Radiocarbon dating}}
[[Image:Ales stenar bred.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|[[Ale's Stones]] at Kåseberga, around ten kilometres south east of [[Ystad]], [[Sweden]] were dated at 56 CE using the carbon-14 method on organic material found at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.raa.se/cms/extern/en/places_to_visit/our_historical_sites/ales_stenar.html |title=Ales stenar |publisher=The Swedish National Heritage Board |date=11 October 2006 |accessdate=9 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331132307/http://www.raa.se/cms/extern/en/places_to_visit/our_historical_sites/ales_stenar.html |archivedate=31 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]] [[Radiocarbon dating]] is also simply called Carbon-14 dating. Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon, with a half-life of 5,730 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark |first=R. M. |year=1975 |title=A calibration curve for radiocarbon dates |journal=Antiquity |volume=49 |pages=251–266 |url=http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/ant/049/Ant0490251.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.5194/angeo-20-115-2002 |first=S.

Carbon-14, though, is continuously created through collisions of neutrons generated by [[cosmic rays]] with nitrogen in the [[upper atmosphere]] and thus remains at a near-constant level on Earth. The carbon-14 ends up as a trace component in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

A carbon-based life form acquires carbon during its lifetime. Plants acquire it through [[photosynthesis]], and animals acquire it from consumption of plants and other animals. When an organism dies, it ceases to take in new carbon-14, and the existing isotope decays with a characteristic half-life (5730 years). The proportion of carbon-14 left when the remains of the organism are examined provides an indication of the time elapsed since its death. This makes carbon-14 an ideal dating method to date the age of bones or the remains of an organism. The carbon-14 dating limit lies around 58,000 to 62,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Wolfango |last=Plastino |author2=Lauri Kaihola |author3=Paolo Bartolomei |author4=Francesco Bella |year=2001 |title=Cosmic background reduction in the radiocarbon measurement by scintillation spectrometry at the underground laboratory of Gran Sasso |url=http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/objectviewer?o=http%3A%2F%2Fradiocarbon.library.arizona.edu%2FVolume43%2FNumber2A%2Fazu_radiocarbon_v43_n2A_157_161_v.pdf |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=43 |issue=2A |pages=157–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of creation of carbon-14 appears to be roughly constant, as cross-checks of carbon-14 dating with other dating methods show it gives consistent results. However, local eruptions of [[volcano]]es or other events that give off large amounts of carbon dioxide can reduce local concentrations of carbon-14 and give inaccurate dates. The releases of carbon dioxide into the [[biosphere]] as a consequence of [[industrialization]] have also depressed the proportion of carbon-14 by a few percent; conversely, the amount of carbon-14 was increased by above-ground [[nuclear bomb]] tests that were conducted into the early 1960s. Also, an increase in the [[solar wind]] or the Earth's [[magnetic field]] above the current value would depress the amount of carbon-14 created in the atmosphere.

===Fission track dating method===
{{Main article|fission track dating}}
[[Image:Apatite Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Apatite]] crystals are widely used in fission track dating.]]
This involves inspection of a polished slice of a material to determine the density of "track" markings left in it by the [[spontaneous fission]] of uranium-238 impurities. The uranium content of the sample has to be known, but that can be determined by placing a plastic film over the polished slice of the material, and bombarding it with [[thermal neutrons|slow neutrons]]. This causes induced fission of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U, as opposed to the spontaneous fission of &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U. The fission tracks produced by this process are recorded in the plastic film. The uranium content of the material can then be calculated from the number of tracks and the [[neutron flux]].

This scheme has application over a wide range of geologic dates. For dates up to a few million years [[mica]]s, [[tektite]]s (glass fragments from volcanic eruptions), and meteorites are best used. Older materials can be dated using [[zircon]], [[apatite]], [[titanite]], [[epidote]] and [[garnet]] which have a variable amount of uranium content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0899-5362(01)80066-X |title=A titanite fission track profile across the southeastern Archæan Kaapvaal Craton and the Mesoproterozoic Natal Metamorphic Province, South Africa: evidence for differential cryptic Meso- to Neoproterozoic tectonism |date=August 2001 |first=J. |last=Jacobs |author2=R. J. Thomas |journal=Journal of African Earth Sciences |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=323–333|bibcode = 2001JAfES..33..323J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the fission tracks are healed by temperatures over about 200&amp;nbsp;°C the technique has limitations as well as benefits. The technique has potential applications for detailing the thermal history of a deposit.

===Chlorine-36 dating method===
Large amounts of otherwise rare [[chlorine-36|&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl]] (half-life ~300ky) were produced by irradiation of seawater during atmospheric detonations of [[nuclear weapon]]s between 1952 and 1958. The residence time of &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl in the atmosphere is about 1 week. Thus, as an event marker of 1950s water in soil and ground water, &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl is also useful for dating waters less than 50 years before the present. &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl has seen use in other areas of the geological sciences, including dating ice and sediments.

===Luminescence dating methods===
{{Main article|Luminescence dating}}

Luminescence dating methods are not radiometric dating methods in that they do not rely on abundances of isotopes to calculate age. Instead, they are a consequence of [[background radiation]] on certain minerals. Over time, [[ionizing radiation]] is absorbed by mineral grains in sediments and archaeological materials such as [[quartz]] and [[potassium feldspar]]. The radiation causes charge to remain within the grains in structurally unstable "electron traps". Exposure to sunlight or heat releases these charges, effectively "bleaching" the sample and resetting the clock to zero. The trapped charge accumulates over time at a rate determined by the amount of background radiation at the location where the sample was buried. Stimulating these mineral grains using either light ([[optically stimulated luminescence]] or infrared stimulated luminescence dating) or heat ([[thermoluminescence dating]]) causes a luminescence signal to be emitted as the stored unstable electron energy is released, the intensity of which varies depending on the amount of radiation absorbed during burial and specific properties of the mineral.

These methods can be used to date the age of a sediment layer, as layers deposited on top would prevent the grains from being "bleached" and reset by sunlight. Pottery shards can be dated to the last time they experienced significant heat, generally when they were fired in a kiln.

==Dating with decay products of short-lived extinct radionuclides==
Absolute radiometric dating requires a measurable fraction of parent nucleus to remain in the sample rock. For rocks dating back to the beginning of the solar system, this requires extremely long-lived parent isotopes, making measurement of such rocks' exact ages imprecise. To be able to distinguish the relative ages of rocks from such old material, and to get a better time resolution than that available from long-lived isotopes, short-lived isotopes that are no longer present in the rock can be used.&lt;ref&gt;Imke de Pater and Jack J. Lissauer: ''Planetary Sciences'', page 321. Cambridge University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-521-48219-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the solar system, there were several relatively short-lived radionuclides like &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al, &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn, and &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I present within the solar nebula. These radionuclides—possibly produced by the explosion of a supernova—are extinct today, but their decay products can be detected in very old material, such as that which constitutes [[meteorite]]s. By measuring the decay products of extinct radionuclides with a [[mass spectrometer]] and using isochronplots, it is possible to determine relative ages of different events in the early history of the solar system. Dating methods based on extinct radionuclides can also be calibrated with the U-Pb method to give absolute ages. Thus both the approximate age and a high time resolution can be obtained. Generally a shorter half-life leads to a higher time resolution at the expense of timescale.

Samples are exposed to neutrons in a nuclear reactor.  This converts the only stable isotope of iodine (&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I) into &lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Xe via neutron capture followed by beta decay (of &lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;I).  After irradiation, samples are heated in a series of steps and the xenon [[isotopic signature]] of the gas evolved in each step is analysed.  When a consistent  &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe/&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Xe ratio is observed across several consecutive temperature steps, it can be interpreted as corresponding to a time at which the sample stopped losing xenon.

Samples of a meteorite called Shallowater are usually included in the irradiation to monitor the conversion efficiency from &lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I to &lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Xe.  The difference between the measured &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe/&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Xe ratios of the sample and Shallowater then corresponds to the different ratios of &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I/&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I when they each stopped losing xenon.  This in turn corresponds to a difference in age of closure in the early solar system.

===The &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al – &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg chronometer===
Another example of short-lived extinct radionuclide dating is the [[Aluminium-26|&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al]] – &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg chronometer, which can be used to estimate the relative ages of [[chondrules]]. &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al decays to &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg with a [[half-life]] of 720 000 years. The dating is simply a question of finding the deviation from the [[natural abundance]] of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg (the product of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al decay) in comparison with the ratio of the stable isotopes &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al/&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;Mg.

The excess of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg (often designated &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg* ) is found by comparing the &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg/&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Mg ratio to that of other Solar System materials.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander N. Krot(2002) Dating the Earliest Solids in our Solar System, Hawai'i Institute of Geophysics and Planetology http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Sept02/isotopicAges.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al – &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg chronometer gives an estimate of the time period for formation of primitive meteorites of only a few million years (1.4 million years for Chondrule formation).&lt;ref&gt;Imke de Pater and Jack J. Lissauer: ''Planetary Sciences'', page 322. Cambridge University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-521-48219-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Zoological Society of Scotland''' is a [[learned society]] and [[registered charity]] of [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC004064}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by an [[Edinburgh]] lawyer, [[Thomas Haining Gillespie]], in 1909. In 1913, a large plot of land was purchased for the Society by the [[Edinburgh Town Council]] on [[Corstorphine Hill]], [[Edinburgh]], a site which later opened to the public as [[Edinburgh Zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Review of Edinburgh Zoo | work = goodzoos.com website | url = http://www.goodzoos.com/UK%20Zoos/edinburg.htm | accessdate=2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society received its [[Royal Charter]] in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. http://www.rzss.org.uk/about-rzss&lt;/ref&gt; The principal objective of the Society mentioned in the original [[charter]] is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"To promote, facilitate and encourage the study of [[zoology]] and kindred subjects and to foster and develop amongst the people an interest in and knowledge of animal life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= History of Edinburgh Zoo | work = Edinburgh Zoo website | url = http://www.edinburghzoo.org.uk/PageAccess.aspx?id=51 | accessdate=2007-06-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070612223212/http://www.edinburghzoo.org.uk/PageAccess.aspx?id=51 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1986, the society also acquired the [[Highland Wildlife Park]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8781">The '''STEPS Centre''' (Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) is an interdisciplinary global research and policy engagement hub at the [[University of Sussex]]. It is funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]]. The Centre brings together [[development studies]] with [[science and technology studies]] and was launched at [[Portcullis House]] in London on 25 June 2007 &lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,,2111237,00.html STEPS towards better development by Mark Tran, The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

By acknowledging the interactions between social, technological and environmental factors in diverse local settings the STEPS Centre seeks to help create more sustainable and socially just conditions for poorer people. Based at the [[Institute of Development Studies]] (IDS) and the [[Science Policy Research Unit]] ([[SPRU]]) at the [[University of Sussex]] in the UK, the Centre works with partners in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Professor Ian Scoones &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/person/ian-scoones IDS Profile for Ian Scoones]&lt;/ref&gt; is the director of the STEPS Centre and Professor [[Andy Stirling]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/300596/Path-finder.htm Path-finder by Andrew Lee, The Engineer, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829000212/http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/300596/Path-finder.htm |date=29 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; its co-director. Professor [[Melissa Leach]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/academicexperts/story/0,,2127736,00.html Melissa Leach: Village voice. To know what's happening around the world, you must ask the locals by Jessica Shepherd, The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/wpsite/wp-content/uploads/ML_-Lunch-with-the-Lancet_-Vol-371-June-21-2008.pdf Perspectives by Priya Shetty, The Lancet, Jun 2008]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; stepped down as STEPS Director in 2014 to become Director of the [[Institute of Development Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/2013/blog/melissa-leach-ids-director/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advisory board ==

The STEPS Centre Advisory Board is chaired by Mike Hulme ([[King's College London]]) with members including [[Brian Wynne]] (CESAGEN, [[University of Lancaster]]), Carl Folke ([[Stockholm Resilience Centre]]), Dipak Gyawali ([[Nepal Academy of Science and Technology]]), [[Fred Pearce]] (science writer), [[Sue Hartley]] (Director, York Environmental Sustainability Institute), [[Suman Sahai]] (Convenor, [[Gene Campaign]]), and [https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomaslingard Thomas Lingard] (Global External Affairs Director, [[Unilever]]).

== Areas of work ==

The STEPS Centre brings together [[social scientists]] and [[natural science|natural scientists]] to work together to try and achieve a breakthrough in thinking and action for development. The Centre's unique ‘pathways’ approach interweaves social, technological and environmental conditions with dynamic change &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrcsocietytoday.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/about/CI/CP/the_edge/issue27/pathways.aspx?ComponentId=26077&amp;SourcePageId=26118 Building genuine pathways to a more secure future, ESRC Today]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; across three domains - food and agriculture; health and disease; water and sanitation - and three themes - dynamics; governance; designs.

Through linking across domains and themes in its projects, the STEPS Centre connects new theory with practical approaches in a bid to help provide sustainable opportunities for poor and marginalised people.

== Pathways approach ==

The STEPS Centre's pathways approach aims to understand the complex, non-linear interactions between social, technological and environmental systems. Some pathways may threaten poor peoples’ livelihoods and health while others create opportunities for sustainability.

The Centre aims to link social scientists, natural scientists and users to develop new tools and methods linking theory with practical solutions. It also offers teaching, in conjunction with IDS and SPRU, to help train a new generation of researchers on MA and PhD courses.

A paper published in 2007 entitled Pathways to Sustainability: an Overview of the STEPS Centre Approach &lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/wpsite/wp-content/uploads/final_steps_overview.pdf Pathways to Sustainability: An overview of the STEPS Centre's Approach]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined the STEPS Centre approach to understanding dynamic systems and their governance. The paper laid out the ingredients of the STEPS Centre's work, including linking diverse social and natural science perspectives, connecting theory, policy and practice and an engaged, interactive approach to communications. Promoting pathways to Sustainability that meet the perspectives and priorities of poor and marginalised groups is at the heart of the pathways approach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7056">[[Image:Hyphae.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mycelial cord]] made up of a collection of hyphae; an essential part in the process of saprotrophic nutrition, it is used for the intake of organic matter through its cell wall. The network of hyphae is referred to as a [[mycelium]], which is fundamental to fungal nutrition.]]
'''Saprotrophic nutrition''' {{IPAc-en|s|æ|p|r|ə|ˈ|t|r|ɒ|f|ɪ|k|,_|-|p|r|oʊ|-}}{{refn|{{cite web |url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/saprotroph |title=saprotroph - definition of saprotroph in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |access-date=2016-01-20 }}}} or '''lysotrophic nutrition''' is a process of [[Chemotroph#Chemoheterotroph|chemoheterotrophic]] [[extracellular digestion]] involved in the processing of decayed (dead or waste) [[organic matter]]. It occurs in '''saprotrophs''' and [[heterotroph]]s, and is most often associated with [[fungus|fungi]] (for example ''[[Mucor]]'') and soil [[bacteria]]. Saprotrophic microscopic fungi are sometimes called '''saprobes'''; saprotrophic plants or [[microbiome#Bacterial flora|bacterial flora]] are called '''saprophytes''' ([[wikt:sapro-|sapro-]] + [[wikt:-phyte|-phyte]], "rotten material" + "plant"), though it is now believed that all plants previously thought to be saprotrophic are in fact [[myco-heterotrophy|parasites of microscopic fungi]] or [[Parasitic_plant|other plants]]. The process is most often facilitated through the [[active transport]] of such materials through [[endocytosis]] within the internal mycelium and its constituent [[hypha]]e.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_principles_1"&gt;{{harvtxt|Clegg|Mackean|2006|p=296}} states the purpose of saprotrophs and their internal nutrition, as well as the main two types of fungi that are most often referred to, as well as describes, visually, the process of saprotrophic nutrition through a diagram of hyphae, referring to the Rhizobium on damp, stale whole-meal bread or rotting fruit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various word roots relating to decayed matter (''detritus'', ''[[wikt:sapro|sapro-]]''), eating and nutrition (''-vore'', ''-phage''), and plants or life forms (''[[wikt:-phyte|-phyte]]'', ''-obe'') produce various terms, such as [[detritivore]], detritophage, saprotroph, saprophyte, saprophage, and saprobe; their meanings overlap, although technical distinctions (based on physiologic mechanisms) narrow the [[word sense|senses]]. For example, [[usage]] distinctions can be made based on macroscopic swallowing of detritus (as an earthworm does) versus microscopic [[lysis]] of detritus (as a mushroom does).

A '''facultative saprophyte''' appears on stressed or dying plants and may combine with the live pathogens.{{cn|date=March 2016}}.

== Process ==
&lt;!-- We need there to be a picture of the process. I'll endeavour to create one, but as ever.. I'm not an expert on such matters. [[User:JCraw|Jordan Craw]] --&gt;
As matter decomposes within a medium  in which a saprotroph is residing, the saprotroph breaks such matter down into its composites.

* [[Protein]]s are broken down into their [[amino acid]] composites through the breaking of peptide bonds by [[protease]]s.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.16"&gt;{{harvtxt|Clegg|Mackean|2006|p=296}}, fig 14.16—Diagram detailing the re-absorption of substrates within the hypha.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lipid]]s are broken down into [[fatty acid]]s and [[glycerol]] by [[lipase]]s.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.16" /&gt;
* [[Starch]] is broken down into pieces of simple disaccharides by [[amylase]]s.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.16" /&gt;

These products are re-absorbed into the hypha through the cell wall via [[endocytosis]] and passed on throughout the mycelium complex. This facilitates the passage of such materials throughout the organism and allows for growth and, if necessary, repair.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_principles_1" /&gt;

=== Conditions ===
In order for a saprotrophic organism to facilitate optimal growth and repair, favourable conditions and nutrients must be present.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.17"&gt;{{harvtxt|Clegg|Mackean|2006|p=296}}, fig 14.17—A diagram explaining the optimal conditions needed for successful growth and repair.&lt;/ref&gt; Optimal conditions refers to several conditions which optimise the growth of saprotrophic organisms, such as;

# '''Presence of water''': 80–90% of the fungi is composed of water by mass, and requires excess water for absorption due to the evaporation of internally retent water.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.17" /&gt;
# '''Presence of oxygen''': Very few saprotrophic organisms can endure anaerobic conditions as evidenced by their growth above media such as water or soil.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.17" /&gt;
# '''Neutral-acidic pH''': The condition of neutral or mildly acidic conditions under [[pH]] 7 are required. &lt;!-- I know why, but i need to reference it :-/ --&gt;&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.17" /&gt;
# '''Low-medium temperature''': The majority of saprotrophic organisms require temperatures between 1&amp;nbsp;°C and 35&amp;nbsp;°C, with optimum growth occurring at 25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.17" /&gt;

The majority of nutrients taken in by such organisms must be able to provide carbon, proteins, vitamins and in some cases, [[ion]]s. Due to the carbon composition of the majority of organisms, dead and organic matter provide rich sources of disaccharides and polysaccharides such as  [[maltose]] and [[starch]], and of the monosaccharide [[glucose]].&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_principles_1" /&gt;

In terms of nitrogen-rich sources, saprotrophs require combined protein for the creation of proteins, which is facilitated by the absorption of amino acids, and usually taken from rich soil. Although both ions and vitamins are rare, thiamine or ions such as potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium aid the growth of the mycelium.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_principles_1" /&gt;

'''SiMERR Australia''' is an Australia-wide research body. Its National Centre is located at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]], NSW, [[Australia]].

SiMERR Australia's main goal is to improve learning outcomes for students in regional and rural areas, particularly in the areas of [[science]], [[mathematics]] and [[Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/aboutus_aims.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The National Centre of Science, ICT, and Mathematics Education for Regional and Rural Australia (SiMERR) grew out of the Centre for Cognition Research into Learning and Teaching (CRiLT), which was part of the School of Education at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/aboutus_history.php&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike CRiLT, SiMERR focused on the curriculum areas of science, mathematics and ICT.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/aboutus_history.php&lt;/ref&gt;

SiMERR opened its doors on 1 July 2004, with branches, or ''hubs'' opening in each state of Australia in the twelve months that followed in partnership universities, such as the [[University of Tasmania]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.simerr.educ.utas.edu.au/launch.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deakin.edu.au/arts-ed/education/simerr/launch.php&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Deakin University]] in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deakin.edu.au/arts-ed/education/simerr/launch.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The SiMERR National summit in 2005 brought together educators and other stakeholders for the first national meeting of its kind since the National Centre opening. The two-day summit brought together people from diverse bodies, such as teacher associations, Federal Government departments, universities, parent groups and educational authorities. Delegates discussed ways in which the educational disadvantage experienced by students in rural and regional areas may be addressed&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/news/archives/000374.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
SiMERR Australia consists of a series of ''hubs'' located in each state in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/partnerships_hubs.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
SiMERR Australia's vision is to work to improve outcomes for students in science, ICT and mathematics so that:
* Parents can send their children to rural and regional schools and know they will experience equal opportunities for a quality education;
*Students can attend rural or regional schools and realise their academic potential in Science, ICT and Mathematics; and
*Teachers can work in rural and regional schools and be professionally connected and supported.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/aboutus_aims.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since 1959, the U.S. Army has been investing a considerable amount of resources into technology-based development of training procedures. In 1968 the U.S. Army officially introduced a training doctrine known as "Systems Engineering of Training" covered in the document CON Reg 350-100-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| publisher=UNITED STATES CONTINENTAL ARMY COMMAND| location=Fort Monroe, Virginia| year=1968| title=''CON Reg 350-100-1''| url=https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:tv440px2527/tv440px2527.pdf| format=PDF| access-date =November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silber, K.H. &amp; Foshay, W.R., ''Handbook of Improving Performance in the Workplace, Instructional Design and Training Delivery'', John Wiley &amp; Sons 2009, {{ISBN|9780470190685}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ybtiAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 p.63]&lt;/ref&gt; 

PG Whitmore cited the CON Reg 350-100-1 definition: "job related skills involving actions affecting primarily people and paper, e.g., inspecting troops, supervising office personnel, conducting studies, preparing maintenance reports, preparing efficiency reports, designing bridge structures."&lt;ref&gt;CON Reg 350-100-1, as cited in Whitmore, Paul G., "What are soft skills?"&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1972 [[CONARC]] Soft Skills Conference Dr. Whitmore presented a report&lt;ref name=wth&gt;Whitmore, Paul G., "What are soft skills?", Paper presented at the [[CONARC]] Soft Skills Conference, Texas, 12-13 December, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fry, John P., "Procedures for Implementing Soft-Skill Training in CONARC Schools,"  Paper presented at the [[CONARC]] Soft Skills Conference, Texas, 12-13 December, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wf&gt;Whitmore, Paul G.; Fry, John P., "Soft Skills: Definition, Behavioral Model Analysis, Training Procedures. Professional Paper 3-74.", Research Report [[ERIC]] Number: ED158043, 48pp.&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at figuring out how the term "soft skills" (in the areas of command, supervision, counseling and leadership) is understood in various CONARC schools. After designing and processing a questionnaire, the following tentative definition was formulated: "Soft skills are important job-related skills that involve little or no interaction with machines and whose application on the job is quite generalized."&lt;ref name=wth/&gt;&lt;ref name=wf/&gt;

They further criticized state of the concept then as vague with a remark "in other words, those job functions about which we know a good deal are hard skills and those about which we know very little are soft skills." Another immediate study by them also concluded in a negative tone.&lt;ref name=wth/&gt;

Psychologist [[Nicholas Humphrey]] famously stated that it is social intelligence that defines humans rather than quantitative intelligence. Many industries today give prominence to soft skills of their employees. It is through a 1972 US Army training manual identified formal usage of the term "soft skills" began.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine S. Newman, ''Chutes and Ladders: Navigating the Low-wage Labor Market'', Harvard University Press 2006, {{ISBN|0674023366}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ERptWNyIsIkC&amp;pg=PA351 p.351]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Soft skills are a cluster of productive personality traits that characterize one's relationships in a milieu. These skills can include social graces, communication abilities, [[language]] skills, personal habits, cognitive or emotional empathy, time management, teamwork and leadership traits. A definition based on review literature explains soft skills as an umbrella term for skills under three key functional elements: people skills, social skills, and personal career attributes.&lt;ref name=marcel/&gt; National Business Education Association deems soft skills as critical for being industrious in today’s workplace.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nbea.org/newsite/curriculum/policy/no_67.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Soft skills complement hard skills also known as technical skills, for productive workplace performance and everyday life competencies (Arkansas Department of Education, 2007). Hard skills were the only skills necessary for career employment and were generally quantifiable and measurable from educational background, work experience or through interview.{{cn|date=September 2016}} In the 20th century soft skills are a major differentiator, a [[sine qua non]] for [[employability]] and success in life.&lt;ref&gt;Heckman and Kautz, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612993/ Hard Evidence on Soft Skills], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by Harvard University noted that 80% of achievements in career are determined by soft skills and only 20% by hard skills. Experts say soft skills training should begin for a person when they are students, to perform efficiently in their academic environment as well as in their future workplace.{{cn|date=September 2016}} A public interest study conducted by McDonald’s in UK predicted over half a million people will be held back from job sectors by 2020 due to lack of soft skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://backingsoftskills.co.uk/|title=McDonald's Backing Soft Skills|publisher=|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Enumeration and categorization==
A person's soft skill is an important part of their individual contribution to the success of an organization.{{cn|date=September 2016}} Organizations which deal with customers face-to-face are generally more successful if they promote activities for staffs to develop these skills through [[Workplace wellness|wellness enhancing programs]].{{cn|date=September 2016}} Training or rewarding for personal habits  or traits such as dependability and conscientiousness can yield significant return on investment for an organization.{{cn|date=September 2016}} For this reason, soft skills are increasingly sought out by employers in addition to standard qualifications.{{cn|date=September 2016}} Studies by Stanford Research Institute and the Carnegie Mellon Foundation among Fortune 500 CEOs established that 75% of long term job success resulted from soft skills and only 25% from technical skills (Sinha, 2008). Hence, soft skills are as important as cognitive/technical skills (John, 2009; Zehr, 1998).

===Soft skills for business executives===
Following is a "top ten" list of soft skills compiled by [[Eastern Kentucky University]] from executive listings.&lt;ref name=marcel&gt;Marcel M. Robles, [http://bcq.sagepub.com/content/75/4/453.abstract Executive Perceptions of the Top 10 Soft Skills Needed in Today’s Workplace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812053907/http://bcq.sagepub.com/content/75/4/453.abstract |date=2016-08-12 }}, Business Communication Quarterly, 75(4) 453–465 ([http://homepages.se.edu/cvonbergen/files/2013/01/Executive-Perceptions-of-the-Top-10-Soft-Skills-Needed-in-Todays-Workplace.pdf pdf])&lt;/ref&gt;

''For the 2001 Doctor Who audio story, see [[The Stones of Venice (audio drama)]]''

'''''The Stones of Venice''''' is a three-volume treatise on [[Venice|Venetian]] art and [[List of architectural monuments of Venice|architecture]] by English art historian [[John Ruskin]], first published from 1851 to 1853.

''The Stones of Venice'' examines Venetian architecture in detail, describing for example over eighty churches. He discusses architecture of Venice's [[Byzantine Architecture|Byzantine]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance]] periods, and provides a general history of the city.

==Views on art and society==
As well as being an art historian, Ruskin was a social reformer. He set out to prove how Venetian architecture exemplified the principles he discussed in his earlier work, ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]]''.&lt;ref&gt;His introduction to the second edition (1855) characterises ''The Seven Lamps of Architecture'' not as a "complete exponent" of his matured views but "rather as an introduction to the more considered and careful statements of those views given in ''The Stones of Venice'', and in my Lectures&lt;!--Lectures in original--&gt; delivered at Edinburgh."&lt;/ref&gt;In the chapter "The Nature of Gothic" (from volume 2), Ruskin gives his views on how society should be organised.
&lt;blockquote&gt;We want one man to be always thinking, and another to be always working, and we call one a gentleman, and the other an operative; whereas the workman ought often to be thinking, and the thinker often to be working, and both should be gentlemen, in the best sense. As it is, we make both ungentle, the one envying, the other despising, his brother; and the mass of society is made up of morbid thinkers and miserable workers. Now it is only by labour that thought can be made healthy, and only by thought that labour can be made happy, and the two cannot be separated with impunity.&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 10.201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Research and publication==
Ruskin had visited Venice before, but he made two visits to Venice with his wife Effie specially to research the book. The first visit was in the winter of 1849-50. The first volume of ''The Stones of Venice'' appeared in 1851 and Ruskin spent another winter in Venice researching the next two volumes. His research methods included sketching and photography (by 1849 he had acquired his own camera so that he could take [[daguerrotypes]]).&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1514218/Mystery-photographs-part-of-Ruskin-collection.html |title=Mystery photographs part of Ruskin collection |last=Reynolds, Nigel |date=2006 |website=Daily Telegraph |access-date=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication history===
====First editions====

*''The Stones of Venice. Volume the First. The Foundations'', 1851, [[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]], London
*''The Stones of Venice. Volume the Second. The Sea-stories'', 1853, Smith, Elder &amp; Co., London
*''The Stones of Venice. Volume the Third. The Fall'', 1853, Smith, Elder &amp; Co., London

====Shortened editions====
Various shortened editions of the book have been published, including one edited by J.G. Links published in the USA in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;John Ruskin, ''The Stones of Venice'', ed. by J.G. Links 1960. {{ISBN|978-0-306-81286-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
It aroused considerable interest in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Britain and beyond. The chapter "The Nature of Gothic" was admired by [[William Morris]], who published it separately in an edition which is in itself an example of [[Gothic revival]]. Morris stated that it was "one of the very few necessary and inevitable utterances of the century".

The book inspired [[Marcel Proust]] (the narrator of the [[In search of lost time|Recherche]] visits Venice with his mother in a state of enthusiasm for Ruskin) and in 2010 [[Roger Scruton]] wrote that the book was, "the greatest description in English of a place made sacred by buildings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectator.org/archives/2010/11/05/the-wilderness-obsession|first=Roger|last=Scruton|title=The Wilderness Obsession|publisher=spectator.org|date=November 2010|accessdate=2012-08-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529214626/http://spectator.org/archives/2010/11/05/the-wilderness-obsession|archivedate=2012-05-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universal design''' is the [[design]] of buildings, products or environments to make them [[accessibility|accessible]] to all people, regardless of age, [[disability]] or other factors.

The term "universal design" was coined by the [[architect]] [[Ronald Mace]] to describe the concept of designing all products and the built environment to be aesthetic and usable to the greatest extent possible by everyone, regardless of their age, ability, or status in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/about_us/usronmace.htm |title=Ronald L. Mace on NC State University, College of Design |publisher=Design.ncsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was the work of Selwyn Goldsmith, author of ''Designing for the Disabled'' (1963), who really pioneered the concept of free access for people with disabilities. His most significant achievement was the creation of the [[curb cut|dropped curb]] – now a standard feature of the built environment.

Universal design emerged from slightly earlier '''barrier-free''' concepts, the broader accessibility movement, and [[adaptive technology|adaptive]] and [[assistive technology]] and also seeks to blend [[aesthetics]] into these core considerations. As [[life expectancy]] rises and [[modern medicine]] increases the survival rate of those with significant injuries, illnesses, and birth defects, there is a growing interest in universal design. There are many industries in which universal design is having strong market penetration but there are many others in which it has not yet been adopted to any great extent. Universal design is also being applied to the design of technology, instruction, services, and other products and environments.

Curb cuts or sidewalk ramps, essential for people in wheelchairs but also used by all, are a common example.  [[Contrast (vision)|Color-contrast]] dishware with steep sides that assists those with visual or dexterity problems are another.  There are also cabinets with pull-out shelves, kitchen counters at several heights to accommodate different tasks and postures, and, amidst many of the world's [[public transit]] systems, low-floor [[bus]]es that "kneel" (bring their front end to ground level to eliminate gap) and/or are equipped with [[Wheelchair ramp|ramp]]s rather than on-board lifts.

==Principles==
The Center for Universal Design at [[North Carolina State University]] expounds the following principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/ |title=Center for Universal Design at North Carolina State University |publisher=Design.ncsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# [[Social equality|Equitable]] use
# [[Flexibility (engineering)|Flexibility]] in use
# [[Simplicity|Simple]] and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]]
# [[Perception|Perceptible]] information
# [[fault tolerance|Tolerance for error]]
# Low physical effort
# Size and space for approach and use

Each principle above is succinctly defined and contains a few brief guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/about_ud/udprinciplestext.htm |title=The Principles of Universal Design Version 2.0 |publisher=Design.ncsu.edu |date=1997-04-01 |accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be applied to design processes in any realm: physical or digital.

These principles are broader than those of [[accessible design]] and barrier-free design.

==Goals of Universal Design==
In 2012, The Center for Inclusive Design and Environmental Access at [[The University at Buffalo]] expanded definition of the principles of universal design to include social participation and health and wellness. Rooted in evidence based design, the 8 goals of universal design were also developed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universaldesign.com/what-is-ud/ |title=The Goals of Universal Design |publisher=Center for Inclusive Design and Environmental Access |date=April 10, 2012 |access-date=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

# Body Fit
# Comfort
# Awareness
# Understanding
# Wellness
# Social Integration
# Personalization
# Cultural Appropriateness

The first four goals are oriented to human performance: [[anthropometry]], [[biomechanics]], [[perception]], [[cognition]]. Wellness bridges human performance and social participation. The last three goals addresses social participation outcomes. The definition and the goals are expanded upon in the textbook "Universal Design: Creating Inclusive Environments." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1=Steinfeld | editor-first1=Edward | editor-last2=Maisel | editor-first2=Jordana | title=Universal Design: Creating Inclusive Environments | publisher=Wiley | date=April 10, 2012 | pages=408 pages }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* Smooth, ground level entrances without stairs
* Surface textures that require low force to traverse on level, less than 5 pounds force per 120 pounds rolling force
* Surfaces that are stable, firm, and slip resistant per ASTM 2047
* Wide interior doors (3'0"), hallways, and alcoves with 60" × 60" turning space at doors and dead-ends

* Signs with light-on-dark visual contrast
* Web pages that provide alternative text to describe images
* Instruction that presents material both orally and visually
* Labels in large print on equipment control buttons
* A museum that allows visitors to choose to listen to or read descriptions

==Design standards==
In 1960, specifications for barrier free design were published. It was a compendium of over 11 years of disability ergonomic research. In 1961, the specifications became the first Barrier Free Design standard called the American National Standard, A1171.1 was published. It was the first standard to present the criteria for designing facilities and programs for the use of disabled individuals. The research started in 1949 at the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]] and continues to this day. The principal investigator is Dr. [[Timothy Nugent]] (his name is listed in the front of the 1961, 1971, 1980 standard). In 1949 Dr. [[Timothy Nugent|Nugent]] also started the [[National Wheelchair Basketball Association]]. This [[ANSI]] A117.1 standard was adopted by the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] [[General Services Administration]] under 35 FR 4814 - 3/20/70, 39 FR 23214 - 6/27/74, 43 FR 16478 ABA- 4/19/78, 44 FR 39393 7/6/79, 46 FR 39436 8/3/81, in 1984 for UFAS and then in 1990 for ADA. The archived research documents are at the [[International Code Council]] (ICC) - ANSI A117.1 division. Dr. [[Timothy Nugent|Nugent]] made presentations around the globe in the late 50's and 60's presenting the concept of independent functional participation for individuals with disabilities through program options and architectural design.

Another comprehensive publication by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] published three editions 1963, 1967, 1976 and 1997 of Designing for the Disabled by [[Selwyn Goldsmith]] UK. These publications contain valuable empirical data and studies of individuals with disabilities. Both standards are excellent resources for the designer and builder.

Disability ergonomics should be taught to designers, engineers, non-profits executives to further the understanding of what makes an environment wholly tenable and functional for individuals with disabilities.

In October 2003, representatives from [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]] met in [[Beijing, China|Beijing]] and agreed to set up a committee to define common design standards for a wide range of products and services that are easy to understand and use. Their goal is to publish a standard in 2004 which covers, among other areas, standards on containers and wrappings of household goods (based on a proposal from experts in Japan), and standardization of signs for public facilities, a subject which was of particular interest to China as it prepared to host the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].

The [[International Organization for Standardization]], the [[European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization]], and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] have developed:

==Design for All (DfA)==
The term '''Design for All''' (DfA) is used to describe a design philosophy targeting the use of products, services and systems by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation. "Design for All is design for human diversity, social inclusion and equality" (EIDD Stockholm Declaration, 2004). According to the [[European Commission]], it "encourages manufacturers and service providers to produce new technologies for everyone: technologies that are suitable for the [[elderly]] and people with [[disabilities]], as much as the teenage techno wizard."&lt;ref name="European Commission"/&gt; The origin of Design for All&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessibletourism.org/resources/uk_museumsand-galleries_disability_directory_pdf_6877.pdf |title=The UK Council for Museums, Archives and Libraries |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  lies in the field of barrier free [[accessibility]] for people with disabilities and the broader notion of universal design.

===Background===
''Design for All'' has been highlighted in Europe by the European Commission in seeking a more user-friendly society in Europe.&lt;ref name="European Commission"&gt;European Commission: [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/einclusion/policy/accessibility/dfa/index_en.htm Design for All (DfA)].&lt;/ref&gt; Design for All is about ensuring that environments, products, services and interfaces work for people of all ages and abilities in different situations and under various circumstances.

Design for All has become a mainstream issue because of the aging of the population and its increasingly multi-ethnic composition. It follows a market approach and can reach out to a broader market. Easy-to-use, accessible, affordable products and services improve the quality of life of all citizens. Design for All permits access to the built environment, access to services and user-friendly products which are not just a quality factor but a necessity for many aging or disabled persons. Including Design for All early in the design process is more cost-effective than making alterations after solutions are already in the market. This is best achieved by identifying and involving users ("stakeholders") in the decision-making processes that lead to drawing up the design brief and educating public and private sector decision-makers about the benefits to be gained from making coherent use of Design (for All) in a wide range of socio-economic situations.

===Examples===
The following examples of Designs for All were presented in the book ''Diseños para todos/Designs for All'' published in 2008 by Optimastudio with the support of Spain's Ministry of Education, Social Affairs and Sports (IMSERSO) and CEAPAT:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.optimastudio.com/disenosparatodos Feo, Roberto &amp; Hurtado, Rosario &amp; Optimastudio ''Diseños para Todos/Designs for All'' Madrid 2008] {{ISBN|978-84-691-3870-0}} Downloadable free version of ''Designs for All''&lt;/ref&gt;

===In information and communication technology (ICT)===
{{Main article|Design for All (in ICT)}}

Design for All criteria are aimed at ensuring that everyone can participate in the [[Information society]]. The European Union refers to this under the terms eInclusion and eAccessibility. A three-way approach is proposed: goods which can be accessed by nearly all potential users without modification or, failing that, products being easy to adapt according to different needs, or using standardized interfaces that can be accessed simply by using assistive technology. To this end, manufacturers and service providers, especially, but not exclusively, in the [[Information and Communication Technologies]] (ICT), produce new technologies, products, services and applications for everyone.&lt;ref name="European Commission" /&gt;

===European DfA organizational networks===
In Europe, people have joined in [[Social network|networks]] to promote and develop Design for All:

*The European Design for All eAccessibility Network (EDeAN)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edean.org/ European Design for All eAccessibility Network] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031211231505/http://www.edean.org/ |date=December 11, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched under the lead of the European Commission and the European Member States in 2002. It fosters Design for All for eInclusion, that is, creating an information society for all. It has national contact centres (NCCs) in almost all EU countries and more than 160 network members in national networks.
*EIDD - Design for All Europe is a [[NGO]] and a 100% self-financed European organization that covers the entire area of theory and practice of Design for All, from the built environment and tangible products to communication, service and system design. Originally set up in 1993 as the European Institute for Design and Disability (EIDD), to enhance the quality of life through Design for All, it changed its name in 2006 to bring it into line with its core business. EIDD - Design for All Europe disseminates the application of Design for All to business and administration communities previously unaware of its benefits and currently (2016) has 31 member organizations in 20 European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfaeurope.eu|title=Design for All Europe|author=|date=|website=EIDD - DfA Europe|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* EuCAN - The European Concept for Accessibility Network started in 1984 as an open network of experts and advocates from all over Europe in order to promote and support the Design for All approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eca.lu|title=Home|author=|date=|website=www.eca.lu|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coordination work of EuCAN and the functioning of the network are mainly voluntary work. In 1999 the Luxembourg Disability Information and Meeting Centre (better known by its acronym “Info-Handicap”) took over the coordination of the steering group, together with the implicit responsibility for the follow-up of the [[European Concept for Accessibility]] (ECA). The EuCAN publications - like ECA - aim to provide practical guidance. They are neither academic nor policy documents.

==The "Barrier-Free" concept==
'''{{Nihongo|Barrier-free|バリアフリー|bariafurii}}''' building modification consists of modifying [[building]]s or facilities so that they can be used by people who are [[disabled]] or have physical impairments. The term is used primarily in Japan and non-English speaking countries (e.g. German: Barrierefreiheit; Finnish: Esteettömyys), while in English-speaking countries, terms such as "accessibility" and "handicapped accessible" dominate in regular everyday use. An example of barrier-free design would be installing a [[Wheelchair ramp|ramp]] for [[wheelchair]]s alongside or in place of steps. In the case of new buildings, however, the idea of barrier free modification has largely been superseded by the concept of universal design, which seeks to design things from the outset to support easy access.

Freeing a building of barriers means:
* Recognizing the features that could form barriers for some people
* Thinking inclusively about the whole range of impairments
* Reviewing everything - from structure to smallest detail
* Seeking feedback from users and learning from mistakes

Barrier free is also a term that applies to handicap accessibility in situations where legal codes such as the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] Guidelines don't make specifications.

An example of a country that has sought to implement barrier-free accessibility in housing estates is Singapore. Within five years, all public housing estates in the country, all of 7,800 blocks of apartments, have benefited from the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mndsingapore.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/making-hdb-towns-user-friendly/|title=Making HDB Towns User Friendly|author=|date=19 November 2012|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Virtual Researcher on Call''' ('''VROC''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]] educational program administered by [[Partners in Research]].  The program connects students with knowledge partners — researchers and professionals — in [[health science|health]] and [[natural sciences]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], and [[mathematics]] ([[STEM fields]]) through [[video conferencing]] and [[podcast|video podcasts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vroc.ca/video/ VROC Video Podcasts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video conferencing==
Video conferencing technology is used to connect researchers and professionals in the STEM fields with [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[secondary school]] classrooms for real time, interactive discussion.

==Partners==
VROC is partnered with over 40 universities, colleges and institutions as well as school boards across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.vroc.ca/vroc/en/partner/| title=Partnered Institutions| publisher=VROC| date=30 August 2010| accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
VROC began with a "Reaching Higher" [[government grant|grant]] from the Ontario [[Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities]] in 2006 under the [[Dalton McGuinty]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://ogov.newswire.ca/ontario/GPOE/2006/04/03/c1712.html?lmatch=&amp;lang=_e.html| title=McGuinty Government Investing in Science Students| author=CNW Group| date=3 April 2006| accessdate=4 September 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Partners in Research was awarded a nearly million dollar grant from the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario to teach southern Ontarian students about careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feddevontario.gc.ca/eic/site/723.nsf/eng/00682.html Government of Canada Supports Science and Tech Programming for Southern Ontario Youth]&lt;/ref&gt;

Partners in Research hosts a national annual awards reception and ceremony entitled The PIR National Awards to celebrate Canadian research in the STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pirweb.org/pir/en/pir-event/| title=PIR National Awards| publisher=Partners in Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeds from this evening support the Virtual Researcher On Call Program.

Deep-Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography, 1996. 43(7-8): p. 1925-1945&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. Video Plankton Recorder (VPR).  2010  [cited 2010 10/25/2010]; Available from: http://www.whoi.edu/instruments/viewInstrument.do?id=1007#1034.&lt;/ref&gt; A VPR consists of five general components: cameras (with magnifying optics &lt;ref&gt;Cabell, D. and G. Scott. The Video Plankton Recorder.  1993; 3:[Available from: http://www.usglobec.org/newsletter/news3/news3.contents.html.{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;), strobe, additive sensor and flight control,  underwater platform and interface software for plankton identification.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, C.S., et al., A three-axis fast-tow digital video plankton recorder for rapid surveys of plankton taxa and hydrography. Limnology and Oceanography: Methods, 2005. 3(FEB.): p. 59-74.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical aspects==
In order to obtain high-quality and low-noise images, [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) sensors are used in the [[camera]] system. In the early design system, the CCD cameras were mounted in one of the arm of the platform. The developments in the recent years made the cameras system possible to be mounted in the platform body along with other sensors and flight control. The magnification power on the cameras should be vary, with high [[magnification]] power on the camera, we can obtain detail observation result on the plankton sample,  such as [[protozoan]] that has &lt;1&amp;nbsp;µm resolution . In other hand, the high magnification is able to identify plankton into [[genus]] level while low magnification of the camera will provide the rare and larger taxa.

The xenon strobe (red-filtered 80 W) provides the VPR systems with the [[Lighting]] to support the work of the video camera. It is placed in the other side of the platform arm. This design is intended to provide the area between camera and strobe as undisturbed water volume for continuous observation in the VPR system.

As a complex system, VPR can also carry several oceanographic sensors in the same time such as, CTD, transmissometer, fluorometer and flowmeter. These sensors enable the system to measure temperature, conductivity, depth, [[flow measurement]], fraction of light in the water and the [[fluorescence]].

The housing or platforms for this instrument is varying depend on the purpose of the survey. These are the particular platform that has been tested and used to mount the VPR:
	
# Towed device
# [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle]](ROV)
# [[Autonomous underwater vehicle]] (AUV)
# Autonomous profiling mooring
The improvements of imaging system to observe, calculate and measure [[plankton]] in the ocean enable the detail observation on the specific plankton community. This early development was conducted by enumerating and counting the [[silhouette]] photography of plankton, the result then is processed with software package such as [[Matlab]].&lt;ref&gt;Benfield, M.C., et al., RAPID Research on Automated Plankton Identification. Oceanography, 2007. 20(2): p. 172-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imaging software===

The most important part in VPR is the plankton identification software. Any developments of the software should improve the required task performed by VPR. In a nutshell, the software should have the ability of:
#Importing the plankton images [[database]] in to the system.
#Validate the object and evaluate from the background of the sample. This qualification should include the capability of the software to discriminate unknown object from plankton.
#Identify and classify the samples therefore plankton can be distinguished from each other.
#Presenting the result in the form of; abundance, size of distribution and biomass.

==Observation result==

The study conducted by Benfield, M.C., et al. has discovered that VPR provided comparable data on the taxonomic composition of the plankton compared to physical plankton survey taken by [[MOCNESS]].

The figure in the right side shows us the general trends in abundance and detail scale patchiness along the observation area.

==Advantage and Disadvantages==

Although a VPR has a drawback for not being able to identify plankton into species level, the advantages to use this instrument has gone beyond its limitation to provide us with convenient and accurate result. The high resolution result on plankton taxa observation along with synchronized measurement environmental variables from another oceanographic sensor attached in VPR body can be considered as the milestone of this device. In addition, since the observation is conducted visually by photographing the sample, the observation of delicate plankton and gelatinous species can be done accurately without having them destroyed in the net.
