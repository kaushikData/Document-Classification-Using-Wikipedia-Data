'''Abdul Samad''' ({{lang-ar| عبد الصمد}}) is a male Muslim given name, built on the Arabic words ''[[Abd (Arabic)|Abd]]'', ''[[al-]]'' and ''[[Samad (disambiguation)|Samad]]''. The name means "servant of the Everlasting", ''al-Samad'' being one of the [[names of God in the Qur'an]], which give rise to the [[List of Arabic theophoric names|Muslim theophoric names]].&lt;ref name=ahmed&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author=Salahuddin Ahmed| publisher = Hurst &amp; Company| location=London| year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rahman&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author= S. A. Rahman| publisher=Goodword Books|  location=New Delhi| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the letter s is a [[sun and moon letters|sun letter]], the letter l of the ''al-'' is assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written with letters corresponding to ''Abd al-Samad'', the usual pronunciation corresponds to ''Abd as-Samad''. Alternative transliterations include ''Abdus Samad'' and others, all subject to variant spacing and hyphenation.

'''Abkhaz neopaganism''', or the '''Abkhaz native religion''', is the [[Modern Paganism|contemporary re-emergence]] of the [[ethnic religion]] of the [[Abkhazians|Abkhaz people]] in [[Abkhazia]], a revitalisation which started in the 1980s.&lt;ref name = "Schnirelmann202"&gt;Schnirelmann, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important holy sites of the religion are the [[Seven Shrines of Abkhazia]], each one having its own priestly clan, where rituals and prayers began to be solemnly restored from the 1990s onwards.

According to the 2003 census, 8% of the population of Abkhazia adheres to Abkhaz neopaganism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.portal-credo.ru/site/print.php?act=fresh&amp;id=188 | first = Александр [Alexande] | last = Крылов [Krylov] | script-title=ru:Единая Вера Абхазских "Христиан" и "Мусульман".

==History==
The traditional Abkhaz religion was actually never completely wiped out; circles of priests, whose activity was kept secret,&lt;ref&gt;Krylov, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; passed on traditional knowledge and rites in the times when Christianity and [[Islam]] became dominant in the region, and later in Soviet times of anti-religion.&lt;ref name = "Schnirelmann202" /&gt;

Since the 1980s, and later in the 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Abkhaz native religion was resurrected by the joint efforts of priests who began to resurface, rural people reactivating local rituals, and urban intellectuals supporting Paganism as an integral part for a reawakening of the Abkhaz [[ethnic]] and cultural identity.&lt;ref name="Schnirelmann202"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Filatov &amp; Shipkov, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

A turning point for the revival of the Abkhaz native religion came with the [[Abkhaz-Georgian conflict|Georgian–Abkhazian conflict]].&lt;ref name = "Schnirelmann205"&gt;Schnirelmann, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; With tensions growing, more and more Abkhazians began associating [[Orthodox Christianity]] with the [[Georgians]], and chose to reject it, turning to the native gods.&lt;ref name = "Schnirelmann205" /&gt; The eventual victory of [[Abkhazia]] in the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|1992–93 war with Georgia]] catalyzed the Neopagan revival. Many Abkhaz believe that their [[national god]] [[Seven Shrines of Abkhazia|Dydrypsh]] awarded them the victory.&lt;ref name="Schnirelmann206"&gt;Schnirelmann, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then the Abkhaz native religion has been protected by Abkhaz authorities.  Government officials took part in a bull sacrifice in October 1993 celebrated to thank the Lord Dydrypsh for the victory over the Georgians, and since then they regularly take part in worship rituals.&lt;ref name="Schnirelmann206"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krylov, 1998a: 24–26; 1998b&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence '''Alan Eyre''' (b.[[Leeds]], 1930) is a British-born Jamaican [[geographer]] and [[environmentalist]].&lt;ref&gt;''Personalities of the Caribbean'' Volume 7 1983 ''EYRE, Lawrence Alan, Ph.D., geographer, univ. lecturer; Snr. Lect. in Geography, UWI Born Leeds, Yorks, Eng., May 3, 1930, son of Harold Eyre and Kathleen his wife. Educated London Geographical Institute, Eng.; UCWJ.''&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also a member of the [[Christadelphian]] church.

Alan Eyre was co-founder of the Department of Geography of the [[University of the West Indies]], [[Mona, Jamaica]]. His academic work has focused on the [[political geography]] of [[shanty town]]s and the degradation of the [[tropical rain forest]].&lt;ref&gt;David Barker, Duncan F. M. McGregor ''Environment and development in the Caribbean: geographical perspectives'' 1995 contributor biographies p303&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work on shanty towns==
In 1972 Eyre published one of the first Caribbean studies on [[urban geography]], showing that the inner city [[tenements]] and not the shanty town was the first destination of rural [[Immigration|migrants]], then, when stable work is found and income saved, outward to the [[wiktionary:peri-urban|peri-urban]] shanty towns;&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Potter, David Barker, Dennis Conway ''The contemporary Caribbean'' 2004 "Fundamentally, Eyre's work serves to show that the principal flow of migrants is not to the shanty towns (Eyre, 1972). The main flow is of rural migrants to the tenement slums of the inner city."&lt;/ref&gt; and noting income variance in the shanty towns.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Potter, Sally Lloyd-Evans ''The city in the developing world'' 1998 A case study: Montego Bay, Jamaica "In 1972, Alan Eyre of the University of the West Indies published an excellent study of the shanty towns of Montego Bay, the second largest settlement in Jamaica, which had a population of approximately 50000 at that time. Eyre noted that strong spatial variations in income and ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Eyre was one of the first urban geographers in [[Caribbean]]-[[Latin America]]n context to clearly document the inner-city/peri-urban shanty distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Pushpa Agnihotri ''Poverty amidst prosperity: survey of slums'' 1994 Page 14 Shanty Towns "Mountjoy (1978) includes all slums in his "spontaneous settlement" whether they be shanty towns of Mexico or favelas (peripheral slums) of Rio-de-Janeiro or bustees (inner-city slums) of India. Eyre (1972), however, seems to have a clearer view about shanty towns"&lt;/ref&gt; In a later study (1984) Eyre found evidence of both marginality and self-improvement in the Jamaican shanty towns.&lt;ref&gt;Deryck R. Brown ''Selected issues and problems in social policy'' 1998 Page 194 "Eyre reviewed selected data from a comprehensive survey of twenty peri-urban shanty towns in Jamaica, carried out by a multidisciplinary team between 1978 and 1982. Among his findings were much evidence of both marginality and ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Eyre's work (1984, 1986) also documented party political violence as a component of peri-urban geography,&lt;ref&gt;EYRE, LA (1984b): The Internal Dynamics of Shanty Towns in Jamaica. In: Caribbean Geography 1, 4, 256-270. EYRE, LA (1986): Party Political Violence and the Struggle for Residential Space in Jamaica. In: Nederlandse Geografiske Studier&lt;/ref&gt; hurricane housing (1989) and self-help housing (1997).&lt;ref&gt;''Self-help housing in the Caribbean'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rainforest preservation==
In ''Slow death of a tropical rainforest: The Cockpit Country of Jamaica, West Indies'' (1994) Eyre proposed that the [[Cockpit Country]], Jamaica's largest remaining contiguous rainforest be zoned a [[World Heritage Site]] in the face of continuing encroachment and degradation, despite proposals for protection having originated as early as Cotterell (1979) and Aiken (1986). Eyre's study was one of the main academic starting points for a petition sponsored by the Cockpit Country Stakeholders' Group and Jamaica Environmental Advocacy Network which was submitted to Prime Minister [[Bruce Golding]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cockpitcountry.org/factsheet.html Cockpit Country.org factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with his brothers [[Ioan Bacalbașa|Ioan]] and [[Constantin Bacalbașa|Constantin]], he entered public life as a [[Republicanism|republican]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] militant. For a while, his career was intertwined with that of [[Marxism|Marxist]] doyen [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], who inspired in him the idea of a socialist art addressed to the masses. He was himself a popularizer of Marxist ideas, and one of the first Marxist intellectuals in Romanian political history.

After 1893, Bacalbașa was at the center of Marxist politics, as an executive of the [[Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party]] (PSDMR). While active within the socialist movement and making his essential contributions to [[Romanian humor|Romanian comediography]], Toni joined [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], his close friend, in editing the satirical magazine ''[[Moftul Român]]''. He helped [[Constantin Mille]] to turn  ''[[Adevărul]]'' daily into a socialist tribune, serving as its editor and directing its short-lived literary supplement (''Adevărul Literar''). His choice of subjects and his perceived harshness were the subject of several controversies, and, in 1894, he defended the ''Adevărul'' office building from rioting anti-socialist students. Over the following years, Bacalbașa drifted away from both ''Adevărul'' and the PSDMR, switching his allegiance to the political club formed around [[Nicolae Fleva]].

At the time of his death, aged 34, Bacalbașa had served in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]] as a representative of the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]]. Despite this change in politics, he is mainly credited for his early contributions to [[Romanian literature]], most of which reflect his critique of the political mainstream in the [[Kingdom of Romania|monarchical era]]. He created the stereotype of the cruel, violent and incompetent officer, and brought to public attention the hazing of young recruits.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Bacalbașa was a native of [[Brăila]], where his father Costache was serving as [[Romanian Police|Police]] chief. The family traced its origins to [[Gorj County]], changing their name from ''Telescu'' to ''Bacalbașa'' (literally, "head of the [[grocer]]s") when one of them became leader of a [[guild]] in [[Galați]]. Costache had a military career in autonomous [[Wallachia]], from 1834 to 1841, then settled in Brăila with his wife Aneta; they had thirteen children, seven of whom died before reaching maturity. According to literary historian [[George Călinescu]], the exact date of Anton's birth is a mystery, but, judging by one of Toni's poems, may be February 21, 1865.&lt;ref name="gc564"&gt;Călinescu, p.564&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors note that Toni was a passionate and extrovert person, but with a generally weak constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.564; Cosco, ''passim''; Kirițescu, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; Born prematurely,&lt;ref&gt;Sanielevici, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; he was reputedly an [[Epilepsy|epileptic]].&lt;ref name="iisalon296"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ilie Ighel, [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/familia/1894/BCUCLUJ_FP_279290_1894_030_25.pdf "Salon. Din Bucureșci"], in ''[[Familia (literary magazine)|Familia]]'', Nr. 25/1894, p.296 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his later poems, Bacalbașa describes himself as unattractive, uncouth, "wax-faced, dead-eyed", and pessimistic.&lt;ref name="gc564"/&gt;

The boy had difficulties completing his education. He attended school only up to the 8th grade, and, upon turning 17, volunteered for service in the [[Romanian Land Forces]],&lt;ref name="gc564"/&gt; where he became a Sergeant.&lt;ref name="if7"&gt;Felea, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; He preserved a bittersweet record of his army service, reflected in both ''Moș Teacă'' and some [[memoir]]s of military life.&lt;ref name="gc564"/&gt; According to his own account, he was insulted by a senior officer for not reporting to him concerning the suicide of one recruit; he avenged himself by punching his superior in front of the entire company. Bacalbașa faced a [[court-martial]] but, since the recruits refused to report him, was merely demoted.&lt;ref name="if7"/&gt;

After leaving the Land Forces, he moved to the capital, [[Bucharest]], where he began associating with the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|left-liberal]], [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical]] and socialist milieus. He was, by various accounts, a good public speaker, who knew how to address the workers,&lt;ref name="gc564"/&gt; but who avoided issues of doctrine and made ample use of "mean gibes" against the politicians in power.&lt;ref name="ck47"&gt;Kirițescu, p.47&lt;/ref&gt; Bacalbașa and his brothers became interested in socialist politics at a time when the local socialist movement was taking its first steps. In 1879, Constantin established a leftist magazine, called ''Drepturile Omului'' ("Human Rights").&lt;ref name="zocapitala"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/capitala_de_odinioar "Capitala de odinioară"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 13/2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanian socialist clubs, which first held congress during that year, were still undecided about which school of thought should inspire their agenda: Marxism, [[Lassallism]], [[Anarchism]] and [[Nihilist movement|Nihilism]] each had adherents in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;''110 ani...'', p.11; Hitchins, pp.374–376&lt;/ref&gt; The proponents of a non-violent and liberal Marxism, as theorized political refugee Dobrogeanu-Gherea, eventually won the day, and the socialist clubs began constructing programs for a [[Collectivism|collectivist]] economy.&lt;ref&gt;''110 ani...'', pp.11–12; Hitchins, pp.376–377&lt;/ref&gt; Anton Bacalbașa had an essential contribution in this process. After 1881, he joined the Marxist group around ''[[Contemporanul]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;''110 ani...'', p.11&lt;/ref&gt; His 1883 brochure, ''Capitalul'', was the first ever introduction to, and summary of, [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.376&lt;/ref&gt; Bacalbașa's literary ambitions were satisfied the same year. Some of his poems saw print in the magazine ''[[Literatorul]]'', which was put out in Bucharest by writer [[Alexandru Macedonski]].&lt;ref name="gc564"/&gt;

Constantin Bacalbașa continued to take the initiative when it came to publicizing Gherea's cause. His 1883 magazine ''Emanciparea'' ("The Emancipation") made history for circulating portions of [[Jules Guesde]]'s version of the "socialist catechism".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mircea Dumitriu, [http://www.romanialibera.ro/cultura/aldine/clarificari-si-replieri-doctrinare-113037.html "Socialiștii români la început de drum. Clarificări și replieri doctrinare"], in ''[[România Liberă]]'', December 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As the years progressed, Anton himself joined in the effort: in 1887, he became the editorial director of ''Desrobirea'' (also translatable as "The Emancipation"), which advertised itself as a voice of the "working men party" (''partidul lucrătorilor'').&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/3265/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_279290_1887_023_45.pdf "Literatură și arte"], in ''[[Familia (literary magazine)|Familia]]'', Nr. 45/1887, p.539 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic Radical, Sotir, ''Democrația Socială''===
[[File:Socialist circle in Bucharest, 1892.jpeg|thumb|400px|An 1892 gathering at Sotir, with [[Constantin Mille]] (holding his two daughters), [[Vasile Morțun]] and [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]] seated in the foreground.

[[Simion Sanielevici]], [[Henric Streitman]], [[Henric Sanielevici]], [[Ion Păun-Pincio]] are among those standing in the bottom row]]
Anton Bacalbașa ran for a seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]] ([[Ilfov County]], 3rd College), during the [[Romanian general election, October 1888|election of October 1888]], picking up just 6 votes.&lt;ref&gt;"Alegerile generale pentru Cameră. Colegiul III", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', October 16, 1888, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Dobrogeanu-Gherea and his pupils had caught negative attention from the governing [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]], and especially from the Conservatives' political-literary faction, ''[[Junimea]]''. In 1889, by means of the socialist press, Bacalbașa popularized the rumor that a Conservative-''Junimist'' cabinet was working on expelling Gherea from the country.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998, II), p.315&lt;/ref&gt; Gherea himself was alarmed by this, and requested an audience with ''Junimea'' leader and [[Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sport (Romania)|Education Minister]] [[Titu Maiorescu]]. Maiorescu reassured Gherea that his followers had no intention of sabotaging the socialist clubs in this disputable manner.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998, II), pp.315–316&lt;/ref&gt;

Around that time, Toni and his brothers became members of the [[Radical Party (Romania)|Democratic Radical Party]], a short-lived and eclectic liberal faction, whose founder and leader was the ex-''Junimist'' [[George Panu]].&lt;ref name="ibtraseism"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Bulei]], [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/lumea-romaneasca-la-1900-traseismul-in-politica-la-sfarsitul-secolului-al-xix-lea-cazul-gheorghe-panu-4972523/ "Lumea românească la 1900. Traseismul în politică la sfârșitul secolului al XIX-lea. Cazul Gheorghe Panu"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', October 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Constantin was afterward the publisher of Panu's political newspaper, ''[[Lupta]]''.&lt;ref name="zocapitala"/&gt; Panu and his men tried to negotiate an alliance against the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL), which had for long been the nominal leftist side of Romania's [[two-party system]]. Their program included a promise that the outgoing PNL [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]], [[Ion Brătianu]], would be made to face trial. The PNL's [[George D. Pallade]] reported with sarcasm that Panu's promise to fight corruption "with the Bacalbașas" could only bring his party votes from "the naive".&lt;ref name="ibtraseism"/&gt;

Both Toni and Constantin were press delegates to the 1890 Congress of Students in [[Botoșani]], a major affair which involved both Conservatives and socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/romanul/1912/BCUCLUJ_FP_P2581_1912_002_0079.pdf "Amintiri despre artistul Liciu"], in ''Românul (Arad)'', Nr. 79/1912, p.10 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1891, "Bacalbașa Anton" was also announced as one of the leading contributors to the literary magazine ''Ecoul Sĕptĕmânii'' ("The Weekly Echo"), alongside a gathering of journalists and social activists: [[Traian Demetrescu]], [[Saniel Grossman]], [[Gheorghe Kernbach|Gheorghe "din Moldova" Kernbach]], [[Dumitru Constantinescu-Teleormăneanu|Dumitru Teleor]], [[Maica Smara]], Berman Goldner-Giordano etc.&lt;ref name="salonl&amp;a262"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/familia/1891/BCUCLUJ_FP_279290_1891_027_22.pdf "Salon.

Toni was later inducted into the Marxist club formed by Constantin Mille at Sotir Hall, Bucharest, and lectured for the public on a weekly basis.&lt;ref&gt;Cosco, p.114; Felea, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Constantin Kirițescu]], who joined the Sotir group as a 17-year-old, recalls that both men "carried the brunt" of organizing and educating the socialist sympathizers.&lt;ref name="ck47"/&gt; According to journalist I. Felea, Toni, who "resembled [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] in looks and speech", was a favorite of the Bucharest workers, and made an impression on them by touching the issue of penniless senior citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Felea, p.7. See also Sanielevici, pp.219–220&lt;/ref&gt; Bacalbașa himself did not have a stable domicile, and slept on the tables at Sotir.&lt;ref name="if7"/&gt; By 1893, Kirițescu notes, the task of representing "Marxist orthodoxy" had fallen on a new arrival, [[Ioan Nădejde]]; the "occult leader" Dobrogeanu-Gherea, already "an invalid", was rarely visiting the club, and was losing support among the rank and file.&lt;ref&gt;Kirițescu, pp.48–49&lt;/ref&gt; Two other figures, [[Alexandru Ionescu (socialist militant)|Alexandru Ionescu]] and Alexandru Georgescu, represented the working class on the Sotir presidium, but they were both in the process of becoming prosperous businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;Kirițescu, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in early 1892, Toni centered his activity on the industrial hub of [[Ploiești]], where he became managing editor of ''Democrația Socială'' ("[[Social Democracy]]"). The weekly paper was financed by a lawyer and entrepreneur, [[Alexandru Radovici]], and was originally apolitical, but moved to the left once Bacalbașa took over.&lt;ref name="pdpdems1"&gt;{{ro icon}} Paul D. Popescu, [http://www.ziarulprahova.ro/stiri/cultura/106156/mic-dictionar-al-presei-prahovene-%E2%80%93-democratia-sociala-i "Mic dicționar al presei prahovene&amp;nbsp;– ''Democrația Socială'' (I)"], in ''[[Ziarul Prahova]]'', February 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He himself lived for a while in the city, and, like Radovici, sat on the Ploiești Workers' Club Executive Committee.&lt;ref name="pdpdems1"/&gt; ''Democrația Socială'' became a rather important voice for the socialist movement, receiving collaborations from Gherea, Demetrescu, Mille, I. Nădejde, [[Sofia Nădejde]], [[O. Carp]] and [[George Diamandy]].&lt;ref name="pdpdems1"/&gt; According to historian Paul D. Popescu, the editorial opinion was divisible into three factions: Gherea was the [[Reformism|evolutionary socialist]], Radovici the [[Liberal democracy|liberal democrat]]; Toni, who made a lasting impression among the readers, represented the [[far left]], prophesying the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].&lt;ref name="pdpdems1"/&gt;

Around that date, Anton Bacalbașa endorsed [[didactic art]], as envisaged by Gherea. The socialists were unnerved by Conservative theorists, who countered with the principle of [[art for art's sake]]. Initially, this was a direct dispute with ''Junimea'' and Maiorescu. Cultural historian [[Z. Ornea]] thus notes that, while Dobrogeanu-Gherea kept silent, his young pupils launched "a veritable anti-''Junimist'' campaign"; among those he lists in this category are Bacalbașa, Demetrescu, S. Nădejde and [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], along with [[Dimitrie Anghel]], [[Emil Fagure]], [[Raicu Ionescu-Rion]], [[Henric Sanielevici]], [[Constantin Stere]] and [[Avram Steuerman-Rodion]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998, II), pp.357–358&lt;/ref&gt; At ''Democrația Socială'', Toni wrote in favor of a workers' art, inspired by the sheer realities of industrial life, and published, in addition to his own short prose, fragments from various socially minded authors—[[Mór Jókai]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Mircea Rosetti]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Émile Zola]] etc.&lt;ref name="pdpdems2"/&gt;

===''Moftul Român''===
[[File:Constantin Jiquidi - Un poet simbolist.JPG|thumb|260px|"The [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Symbolist poet]]", as portrayed by ''[[Moftul Român]]'' cartoonist [[Constantin Jiquidi]]]]
The busiest part of Toni Bacalbașa's short career covers the years 1893–1894. He had by then befriended the influential satirist Caragiale, and, with him, began work on the humorous gazette ''[[Moftul Român]]''. The two authors had different backgrounds: to Bacalbașa's socialism, Caragiale opposed a conservatism formed during his stay with ''Junimea''. Literary historian [[Tudor Vianu]] notes that, in a cheerful manner, ''Moftul'' reflected that ''Junimist'' agenda, skeptical toward all cultural innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, pp.183–184&lt;/ref&gt; According to philologist [[Ștefan Cazimir]], the magazine was mainly a [[parody]] of the [[Neoromanticism|neoromantic]] and modern [[kitsch]], prevalent in the ''[[fin de siècle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cazimir, pp.20–21, 28–31&lt;/ref&gt; Its title translates into "The Romanian Trifle" or "The Romanian Nonsense", referencing one's uppity answer to things presented as new: ''moft!'' (in the same sense of "bollocks!"). ''Moftul'' editorials had it that ''moft!'' was a national characteristic, what "spleen" is to the [[English people|English]], "chauvinism" to the [[Hungarians]], and "Nihilism" to the [[Russians]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p.183&lt;/ref&gt;

Caragiale's paper was in large part poking fun at the nationalist and traditionalist current in [[Romanian literature]], parodying stories about peasant life.&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, pp.41–46; Vianu, p.185&lt;/ref&gt; A predilect victim was the nationalist scholar and Caragiale critic [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], his life's work of gathering etymological data ridiculed as "the ''Magnum Mophtologicum''".&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, pp.64–65&lt;/ref&gt; Also featured were Caragiale's first jibes against the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Symbolist movement]], including lampoons of Bacalbașa's former patron, Alexandru Macedonski.&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, pp.63–64, 134–135&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, ''Moftul Român'' taunted some ''Junimist'' colleagues, including Maiorescu—whom it depicted as a libertine and a seducer of schoolgirls.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/mai_avem_azi_un_maiorescu_ii "Mai avem azi un Maiorescu? (II)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 20/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one account, Caragiale himself visited Sotir, where he lectured about the causes and consequences of human stupidity.&lt;ref&gt;Felea, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moftul Român'' did host the occasional socialist article, including an unsigned tribute to [[International Workers' Day|May Day]], most likely written by Bacalbașa himself.&lt;ref name="astovcamil"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Al. Săndulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/procesul_stalinist_al_tovarsului_camil "Procesul stalinist al 'tovarășului Camil' "], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 11/1999&lt;/ref&gt; The pieces were many times anonymous, and it is occasionally difficult for researchers to distinguish between Caragiale and Bacalbașa's articles. According to Caragiale expert [[Șerban Cioculescu]], the differences are mostly in style and orthographic preference: Caragiale still used the antiquated [[Romanian alphabet|Romanian letters]] ''ĕ'' and ''ê'', while Toni had updated his writing to the latest norms.&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, Toni completed the first collection of ''Moș Teacă'' stories, printed in Bucharest with the subtitle ''Din cazarmă'' ("From the Boot Camp").&lt;ref name="gc1006"&gt;Călinescu, p.1006&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing an [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] readership in [[Transylvania]] and other parts of [[Austria-Hungary]], the cultural journal ''[[Familia (literary magazine)|Familia]]'' introduced Bacalbașa as an active participant to "the discussion on art", and reported that the book "enjoyed an unusually great success" in a Romanian context.&lt;ref name="salonl&amp;a598-599"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/3630/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_279290_1894_030_50.pdf "Salon.

===PSDMR and ''Adevărul Literar'' campaigns===
After prolonged debates and negotiations, the various socialist assemblies fused with each other, creating, in March 1893, the PSDMR. It has been described as Romania's "first nation-wide [[Working class|working-class]] party",&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.378&lt;/ref&gt; and called itself "the vanguard of socialism" in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;"Le parti...", p.596&lt;/ref&gt; Toni Bacalbașa was not delegated by Bucharest to represent the Sotir circle at the original PSDMR Congress, and ''Moftul Român'' published a piece attacking Nădejde for having organized that meeting behind closed doors.&lt;ref&gt;Felea, pp.6, 8&lt;/ref&gt; He may still have been present at that reunion, representing another club.&lt;ref name="ii54"&gt;Iacoș, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Toni was also a noted guest at the Sotir meeting acknowledging the party's establishment, addressing a packed hall.&lt;ref&gt;Felea, p.7; Iacoș, pp.54, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

His political role was recognized by his peers, who nominated him for the Commission drafting the party program,&lt;ref name="ii54"/&gt; then elected him on the party's governing body (the General Council).&lt;ref name="vd(09)42"&gt;Durnea (2009), p.42&lt;/ref&gt; Bacalbașa was one of the six people elected by the congress into a ten-member delegation to the [[Second International]]'s [[Zurich Socialist and Labour Congress, 1893|Zurich Congress]], but was replaced at the last minute.&lt;ref&gt;Iacoș, pp.58–59&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, superseded by the PSDMR's own press (''[[Lumea Nouă]]'', ''[[Munca]]''), ''Democrația Socială'' closed down.&lt;ref name="pdpdems2"/&gt; Also in 1893, Constantin Mille took over leadership of the republican daily ''Adevărul'', making it the informal PSDMR platform. Toni was appointed as one of the paper's editors,&lt;ref name="cc115"&gt;Cosco, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; and authored what is probably the first-ever interview in Romanian media history.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/caragiale_n_tradiia_interviului "Caragiale în tradiția interviului"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 9/2005&lt;/ref&gt; The other Bacalbașas were also enlisted by ''Adevărul'': Constantin was one of the main editors;&lt;ref name="zocapitala"/&gt; Ioan was famous as the [[gossip columnist]] (and infamous for never using commas).&lt;ref name="ftviata"&gt;{{ro icon}} Florentina Tone, [http://www.adevarul.ro/articole/povesti-din-viata-adev-rului.html "Povești din viața ''Adevĕrului''"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418013032/http://www.adevarul.ro/articole/povesti-din-viata-adev-rului.html |date=April 18, 2009 }}, in ''[[Adevărul]]'', December 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by journalist Ilie Ighel in ''Familia'', there was a swift transition from republicanism to socialism, effected when some of the old staff left ''Adevărul''. He wrote: "[instead,] a sinister character emerges, in the person of Anton Bacalbașa, the graduate of two gymnasium classes, along with other unknown celebrities [...]. It is certain that such transitions from one stance to the other have disgusted the cultured public, giving birth to a deep resentment for this sheet that, once taken over by Anton Bacalbașa, did not embrace [[scientific socialism]], [...] but proceeded to insult with brutality all those things that are notable in industry, commerce, finance".&lt;ref name="iisalon296"/&gt; In retrospect, Constantin Bacalbașa also admitted that the socialist takeover was made possible because [[Alexandru Beldiman]], the newspaper's owner, was "weak-willed".&lt;ref&gt;C. Bacalbașa, p.160&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dezrobirea Muncitorilor (Lumea Nouă 11, 1895) MI aug73.jpg|thumb|270px|PSDMR propaganda in the magazine ''[[Lumea Nouă]]'', 1895. The female figure represents [[social democracy]], and the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] is marked ''[[Proletarians of all countries, unite!]]'']]
Toni was a noisy presence at ''Adevărul'', and for this reason did not get along with Beldiman. According to one account, he and Beldiman got into a war of nerves, interrupting each other's activities with the sound of bells—moving from standard [[handbell]]s to heavy [[cowbell]]s.&lt;ref name="ftviata"/&gt; Toni was later assigned to lead the ''Adevărul Literar'' cultural supplement, which gave him the opportunity to engage in major debates over literary theory. Călinescu describes enterprise as reflecting "the socialist spirit".&lt;ref name="gc564"/&gt; When Caragiale lost his position as a civil servant and fell back on money earned with his restaurant, Toni attempted to stir an anti-government reaction among the general public. His publicity stunt, taken up by ''Adevărul Literar'', was a faux [[obituary]], announcing that, if stripped of a salary, Caragiale was (as good as) dead.&lt;ref name="cc115"/&gt;

Several sources note that Bacalbașa was a harsh reviewer of literary works, who made sure to point out the flaws of literary debutantes.&lt;ref name="cc114"&gt;Cosco, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grdebutul335"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/jspui/bitstream/123456789/18758/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_486684_1928_044_0021.pdf "George Ranetti despre debutul său literar"; "Note biografice"], in ''[[Universul Literar]]'', Nr. 21/1928, p.335 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftscriit"&gt;{{ro icon}} Florentina Tone, [http://www.adevarul.ro/articole/scriitorii-de-la-adev-rul.html "Scriitorii de la ''Adevĕrul''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427072852/http://www.adevarul.ro/articole/scriitorii-de-la-adev-rul.html |date=2009-04-27 }}, in ''[[Adevărul]]'', December 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, ''Adevărul Literar'' received contributions from, among others, Demetrescu, Constantin Stere (with the pen name ''Un observator ipohondru'', "A Hypochondriac Observer"), H. Sanielevici, [[Simion Sanielevici]], [[Ion Gorun]] and [[Artur Stavri]].&lt;ref name="ftscriit"/&gt; Also featured, on his debut, was the aspiring humorist [[George Ranetti]], who received the signature ''Namuna'', and who referred to Bacalbașa as "my literary godfather".&lt;ref name="grdebutul335"/&gt;

Bacalbașa's efforts were again mainly dedicated to the promotion of didactic art. The main cultural battle was no longer carried between the PSDMR and ''Junimea'', but between the socialist and non-socialist advocates of didacticism. ''Adevărul Literar'' directed its passion against author [[Alexandru Vlahuță]] and his journal ''[[Vieața]]'', whose pro-didactic agenda was more [[right-wing]] than Mille's.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.564; Durnea (2009), p.42&lt;/ref&gt; Vlahuță was already outraged by Caragiale's unsigned parodies in ''Moftul'', calling them the work of "some stupid parvenu".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p.185&lt;/ref&gt; His conflict with the Gherea socialists was, according to Călinescu, rather pointless, since Bacalbașa is "only apparently an adversary of Vlahuță's".&lt;ref name="gc564"/&gt; The debate nevertheless grew into a mutual animosity. In one of his letters, Vlahuță feigns shock at the discovery that Toni has judged him to be "talentless".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/cum_se_mpac_literaii_cu_muzicienii_ii "Cum se împacă literații cu muzicienii (II)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 16/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute over such issues grew more heated as others joined in. According to Kirițescu, Toni's debate with Doctor [[Alceu Urechia]], an anti-didacticist, degenerated into "a suburbanite airing of dirty laundry";&lt;ref name="ck46"&gt;Kirițescu, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; while Cosco writes that their quarrel was "a waste of humor".&lt;ref name="cc115"/&gt; When Gherea was challenged from the left by a pseudonymous author, ''I. Saint Pierre'', Bacalbașa and his journal reacted with vehemence, debating over this issue with Steuerman-Rodion, a more moderate socialist chronicler.&lt;ref name="vdpierre"/&gt; Yet another target for Toni's criticism was the old historian and novelist [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], who, still grieving for his daughter [[Iulia Hasdeu|Iulia]], allowed himself to be entirely absorbed into the polemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ludovic Dauș]], [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/jspui/bitstream/123456789/18826/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_486684_1929_045_0036.pdf "Amintiri despre Haralamb Lecca"], in ''[[Universul Literar]]'', Nr. 36/1929, p.563 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; Bacalbașa was widely credited as the winner of this collateral dispute, and even Hasdeu was pleasantly surprised by his talents, recommending him as Romania's only genuine journalist.&lt;ref name="cc115"/&gt;

Toni's socialist disciples prolonged the scandal, publishing an offshoot of ''Moftul'', entirely dedicated to satirizing the anti-PSDMR coalition, and titled ''Putregaiul Român'' ("The Romanian Rot").&lt;ref name="ck46"/&gt; Bacalbașa's political and artistic preoccupations formed the basis for three new books, all printed in 1894. One was dedicated to, and named after, his conference on the topic of "art for art's sake" (''Artă pentru artă'').&lt;ref name="gc1006"/&gt; Another one was a social pamphlet, ''Bătaia în armată'' ("Beatings in the Army").&lt;ref name="gc1006"/&gt; The third was a selection of [[novella]]s, ''Din viața militară'' ("From the Military Life").&lt;ref name="salonl&amp;a598-599"/&gt; Also in 1894, Toni and Radovici made new visits to Ploiești, where they recruited members for the socialist movement.&lt;ref&gt;"Le parti...", p.589&lt;/ref&gt;

===1894 scandals===
Together with Mille and other ''Adevărul'' socialists, Toni was openly courting the much larger PNL. In early 1894, he wrote an ''Adevărul'' piece, calling on the PNL to move further to the left, by "openly embracing the democratic ideals."&lt;ref name="vd(09)32"&gt;Durnea (2009), p.32&lt;/ref&gt; The offer of a liberal-socialist alliance was announced by the PSDMR's own program, but ignored by the PNL; as a result of this attitude, the PSDMR's Diamandy even suggested an alliance with the governing Conservatives.&lt;ref name="vd(09)32"/&gt; Bacalbașa, Mille and Beldiman were all present at a January 1894 conference, which aimed to coalesce the left into a pressure group for [[universal suffrage]]. It reached out to the Radicals and liberal democrats at ''[[Românul]]'' and ''[[Evenimentul]]'' newspapers, and then to independent [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] activists ([[Vasile Kogǎlniceanu]], [[Constantin Dobrescu-Argeș]]), but, a few months later, broke down into competing factions.&lt;ref&gt;Vasile Niculae, "Liga votului universal", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', August 1973, pp.72–73&lt;/ref&gt; On January 24, Toni published in ''Adevărul'' a [[Fairy tale|fairy-tale]]-like lampoon directed at the [[King of Romania|Romanian King]] [[Carol I of Romania]] and at his designated successor [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand]], caricatured as the "avaricious" emperor and the repulsive ''Urechilă'' ("Floppy Ears").&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Anton Bacalbașa, ''Urechilă Moștenitor'', accessible through the [[Marxists Internet Archive]] [http://www.marxists.org/romana/tematica/literatura/index.htm Romanian Literature page]; retrieved March 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A serious scandal erupted in June 1894, when the socialists found themselves targeted by nationalist students mobs, who objected to the PSDMR's alleged snubbing of the Romanians of Transylvania. The demonstrations soon degenerated into an attack on private institutions, including the ''Adevărul'' headquarters. According to the hostile account of Ilie Ighel, this was the public's way of punishing Bacalbașa's [[proletarian internationalism]].&lt;ref name="iisalon296"/&gt; ''Familia'' also reported that the students had originally asked Bacalbașa to tone down his agenda, to which he allegedly replied: "Get out, you dastards!"&lt;ref name="ceenou251"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/3662/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_279290_1894_030_21.pdf "Ce e nou?

The Police intervened in the squabble, and placed the ''Adevărul'' building under armed guard.&lt;ref name="ceenou251"/&gt; Arrest warrants were issued for the ''Adevărul'' staff: Mille and Alexandru Ionescu were taken into custody and released a short while after, whereas Bacalbașa absconded.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/jspui/bitstream/123456789/18029/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_P3441_1894_012_0021.pdf "Știri"], in ''[[Universul Literar]]'', Nr. 21/1894, p.6 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

Mille's group found a friend in Constantin Stere, by then a maverick member of the PNL, who began maneuvering against the PNL's right-wing from the inside. Managing a literary sheet put out by the pro-PNL ''Evenimentul'', Stere supported ''Adevărul'' in its campaign for literary didacticism, and organized rallies of solidarity with the Bucharest socialists. This happened just as Toni was publishing satirical pieces targeting ''Evenimentul'' owner George A. Scorțescu, which left Stere in an awkward position.&lt;ref name="vd(09)42"/&gt; Stere was consequently accused by ''Evenimentul'' of being a spy and a tool for the Conservatives. The incidents were reviewed with caution by ''Adevărul'', whose panelists feared that a Conservative conspiracy was in the making, but Toni also criticized the PNL papers for suggesting the same.&lt;ref&gt;Durnea (2009), pp.33, 42–44&lt;/ref&gt;

When Stere challenged Scorțescu to a duel, Bacalbașa covered the affair for ''Adevărul''. Although he condemned Scorțescu's editorial policy, Toni advised Stere to withdraw his demand for satisfaction, or else "all the crooks and vermin will only have to learn how to duel and that's how the press will be banned from taking a stand."&lt;ref&gt;Durnea (2009), pp.36–37&lt;/ref&gt; In his column of October 1, when he discussed the Conservatives' decision to expel all "trouble-making" students, he admitted that the complications of the affair surpassed his power of understanding: "I could not say [who is right] anymore, there's a sort of black confusion in my mind".&lt;ref&gt;Durnea (2009), p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

The friendship between Bacalbașa and Mille had soured over those months, and Toni soon left ''Adevărul'' for good. It is possible that this rift occurred because of Beldiman, who ceded his stock to Mille without even considering Bacalbașa for a successor.&lt;ref name="ftparinte"&gt;{{ro icon}} Florentina Tone, [http://www.adevarul.ro/articole/parintele-ziaristicii-romane-moderne.html "Părintele ziaristicii române moderne"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406070444/http://www.adevarul.ro/articole/parintele-ziaristicii-romane-moderne.html |date=April 6, 2009 }}, in ''[[Adevărul]]'', December 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was of interest to the entire socialist movement, since ''Adevărul'' vied for attention with the same niche of the working public.&lt;ref name="110ani12"&gt;''110 ani...'', p.12&lt;/ref&gt; One of Stere's colleagues, the socialist N.

During that year, Toni was still active in the party, writing for ''Lumea Nouă'' and upholding Gherea's political line. His articles touched a sensitive subject: the Law on Mining, passed by the ''Junimist'' Prime Minister [[Petre P. Carp]], which did away with the PNL's [[protectionism]] and greatly increased foreign investment in the Romanian economy.&lt;ref name="zo(98i)329-330"&gt;Ornea (1998, I), pp.329–330&lt;/ref&gt; The PSDMR, committed to the Marxist theory on the [[relations of production]], supported the law as a step forward into [[capitalism]], but also criticized it for not allowing a state monopoly on mines.&lt;ref name="zo(98i)329-330"/&gt; Also that year, Bacalbașa dueled with a certain Bogdanovici, having Caragiale as his witness. The event is remembered in literature because Caragiale, using his trademark [[Black comedy|black humor]], called on the duelers to fire their pistols from a distance of ten paces.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp.493–494&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservative politics and death===

Eventually, Bacalbașa formalized his split with the socialist party. From 1896, both he and his rival Scorțescu were members of a PNL splinter group, presided upon by lawyer [[Nicolae Fleva]].&lt;ref&gt;Cosco, p.115; Durnea (2009), p.42&lt;/ref&gt; He served the "Flevist" cause as a writer for ''[[Dreptatea]]'' daily, then as a public speaker, organizing rallies at Dacia Hall and agitating the public for the reinstatement of [[Ghenadie Petrescu]] as [[Patriarch of All Romania|Metropolitan-Primate]].&lt;ref name="cc115"/&gt; All three Bacalbașas, together with Fleva and the ''Lumea Nouă'' socialists (represented by A. Ionescu), also protested when PNL Prime Minister [[Dimitrie Sturdza]] expelled [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] refugees for having questioned his [[Balkans]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;C. Bacalbașa, pp.196–197&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, Toni embarked on an additional venture, creating a satirical magazine named after (and featuring stories with) ''Moș Teacă''. In its first series, the periodical hosted a lampoon piece by the young leftist writer [[Gala Galaction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cornelia Ștefănescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/substana_uman "Substanța umană"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 3/2003&lt;/ref&gt; and Toni's own satirical portrait of Caragiale as a political opportunist, gravitating between the ''Junimists'' and [[George Panu]]'s Radicals.&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, p.23; {{ro icon}} Ion N.

The journalist settled down to a family life, marrying Alexandrina Scărișoreanu (who was ten years his younger).&lt;ref name="gc564"/&gt; He also accepted an offer from Transylvania's ''[[Vatra (Romanian magazine)|Vatra]]'' magazine (co-edited by Caragiale) to set up its satirical supplement ''Hazul'' ("Fun"), but the venture failed to interest the public and was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.564.

During 1899, Bacalbașa followed Fleva's group as it merged into the Conservative Party. His presence alongside Maiorescu was recorded with displeasure by the ''Junimist'' [[Ioan Slavici]], as one of the reasons why Conservative politics had become ineffectual.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Stelean Boia, [http://www.revista-studii-uvvg.ro/files/revista_IV_4.pdf "Ioan Slavici&amp;nbsp;– ''Tribuna'' și tribunismul în context european"], in the [[Vasile Goldiș West University of Arad]] [http://www.revista-studii-uvvg.ro/ ''Studii de Știință și Cultură''], Nr. 4/2008, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; A Conservative cabinet was called to power, with Fleva as the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Romania)|Agriculture Minister]], and Bacalbașa ran in the [[Romanian general election, 1899|general election of 1899]], earning an [[Ilfov County]] seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Bacalbașa, p.270; Cosco, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; Toni still pursued his literary interests: together with "Constantin Ivan" (the common pseudonym of his two brothers), he wrote the 3-act political [[revue]] ''Pardon!''.&lt;ref&gt;C. Bacalbașa, p.257; Călinescu, p.1006&lt;/ref&gt;

This was to be his last known endeavor: on October 1, 1899, having contracted [[bacterial pneumonia]],&lt;ref name="gc564"/&gt; Bacalbașa died, and was buried at [[Bellu cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; Public mourning was taken up by both Fleva and Caragiale.&lt;ref name="cc115"/&gt; According to the former: "Through every sort of trouble, through every storm I ever had to cross into, I felt strong knowing that Anton Bacalbașa was with me. It is to his talent, his heart and his friendship that I owe the best years of my public life."&lt;ref name="cc115"/&gt; The same year, the PSDMR itself disappeared from the scene: [[Ioan Nădejde]] and his "generous ones" faction denounced socialist politics as too feeble for the Romanian context, and joined the PNL, leaving a minority, under [[C. Z. Buzdugan]], [[I. C. Frimu]] and [[Christian Rakovsky]], to establish a more radical workers' party (embryo of the post-1910 [[Social Democratic Party of Romania (1910-1918)|Social Democratic Party]]).&lt;ref&gt;''110 ani...'', pp.12–15; Hitchins, pp.380–381&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Constantin Jiquidi - Valorosul Căpitan Moș Teacă citește regulat organul nostru 11 feb 1896.png|thumb|290px|[[Moș Teacă]] reading about himself in the eponymous magazine—caricature by [[Constantin Jiquidi]], February 1896]]
During his 1890s polemics, Anton Bacalbașa explained at length what his vision of didacticism meant. His stated belief was that: "In all of our works, that which is alive first and foremost is ourselves."&lt;ref name="gc565"&gt;Călinescu, p.565&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, George Călinescu writes, Toni "was far from pouring socialism over everything", and believed that poetry in particular should be apolitical.&lt;ref name="gc565"/&gt; As early as 1894, [[Avram Steuerman-Rodion]] noted that the ''Adevărul Literar'' editor had been straying away from Dobrogeanu-Gherea's didactic path.&lt;ref name="vdpierre"/&gt;

''Moș Teacă'', which endures as Bacalbașa's best liked series,&lt;ref name="gc564"/&gt; is a tragicomic account of military life. The eponymous hero is a grotesque Army Captain, who is comically illiterate but savage in his treatment of the recruits. The reader never learns his actual name, but only his nickname, literally "Old Man [[Scabbard]]", but also rendered as "Captain [[Scabbard]]"&lt;ref name="abscabbard"&gt;Anton Bacalbașa, [http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_captain-scabbard.html "Captain Scabbard (excerpts)"], in ''[http://www.plural-magazine.com/ Plural Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321152817/http://www.plural-magazine.com/ |date=March 21, 2012 }}'', Nr. 10/2001&lt;/ref&gt; (Bacalbașa hints that derogatory nicknames were commonly used by the recruits when referring to their unpopular superiors).&lt;ref name="hgporecle"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Horia Gârbea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/personajele._porecle_i_diminutive "Personajele. Porecle și diminutive"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 7/2012&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally held that Toni's anti-hero is in large part inspired by a standard of [[French literature]], in particular by [[Charles Leroy]]'s ''Col. Ramollot'' and [[Henry Monnier]]'s ''[[M. and Mme. Joseph Prudhomme|Joseph Prudhomme]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.564; Kirițescu, p.47&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is nuanced by researcher [[Constantin Ciopraga]], who argues: "As a former army volunteer, the future journalist Bacalbașa did not need the French model proposed by Charles Leroy in ''Le Colonel Ramollot''; he was directly familiarized with the [[Prussian virtues|Prussian spirit]] of yesteryear."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Constantin Ciopraga]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/CIOPnov.html "Proze recente"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Moș Teacă has lived all his life in the army, having been a drummer boy by vocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Horia Gârbea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/pentru_urechile_i_sufletele_personajelor "Pentru urechile și sufletele personajelor"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 2/2008&lt;/ref&gt; His obtuse nature greatly disturbs his understanding of civilian affairs: when he is informed that the [[Dâmbovița River]] has swelled, he asks, "Who gave the order for this?"&lt;ref name="gc564"/&gt; He provides his men with incomprehensible advice on how to march, instructs them how to make a polite retreat if the enemy catches them without a weapon, and, while on maneuvers on the [[Prut River]], orders them to combat the [[epizootic]] with a verbal inspection of the cattle.&lt;ref name="abscabbard"/&gt;

Teacă and the other infantry officers are especially violent toward the recruits, and use a wide inventory of corporal punishments, on an advancing scale. In addition to hitting the young soldiers (with their bare knuckles, with sword belts, or with sticks), they force some to run around for hours with a "bitch" (the regimental [[Maxim gun]]) on their back,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Horia Gârbea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/agresiuni_ncierri_i_arme "Agresiuni, încăierări și arme"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 31/2006&lt;/ref&gt; or to hold aim while staring directly into the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Horia Gârbea]], [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=482&amp;editie=27 "La cremenal! Avocați și osîndiți"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 23-24/2008&lt;/ref&gt; In ''La garda pieții'', the soldiers react badly to injustice and stage a protest, but their effort is ultimately wasted by intrigues.&lt;ref name="ablagarda601-603"/&gt; Other categories of servicemen are also touched by Bacalbașa's wit. His stories show [[military medicine]] as a grim spectacle: the physicians are either criminally incompetent or sadistic, driving recruits to the brink of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Horia Gârbea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/personaje_boale_i_doftori "Personaje, boale și doftori"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 37/2007&lt;/ref&gt; The elite cavalry (''Roșiori'') show particular restraint in public, but are merciless in dealing with their young subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Horia Gârbea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/cai_clrei_i_atelaje_hipo "Cai, călăreți și atelaje hipo"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 11/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Army men were generally irritated by Bacalbașa's comedy. Some ten years after the author's death, [[Constantin I. Brătianu|General Brătianu]] commented that Moș Teacă was the stuff of imagination, and propaganda "for the naive".&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantin I. Brătianu]], ''Ce este cu Era nouă în oștire. Studiu retrospectiv'', Albert Baer, Bucharest, 1909, pp.59–62, 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; Toni himself probably intended to make Teacă reach beyond the topic of [[antimilitarism]]. As he explained, Teacă might just as well be active in environments other than the boot camp, from the marketplace to the [[Senate of Romania]].&lt;ref name="gc564"/&gt; In order to ridicule his colleagues in the media, Bacalbașa created an alternative character, the self-seeking newspaperman ''Spanachidi'' (said to have been based on a real-life model).&lt;ref name="cc114"/&gt;

Bacalbașa's other humorous works are scattered. Călinescu describes him as a restless "buffoon" and "an unpretentious journalist", but acknowledges that his French wit and verve have raised the level of Romania's media.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp.564–565&lt;/ref&gt; Toni's parodies of Symbolism, published in ''Moftul Român'', are described by Cioculescu as even better than those signed by Caragiale, since they hit closer to "the mark".&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, pp.63–64&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his other written contributions are [[homograph]]ic [[one-line joke]]s, or samples of [[absurd humor]] in the ''[[épater la bourgeoisie]]'' tradition, while his memoirs record the involuntarily humorous rhyming of a poet-soldier.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp.564, 565&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu finds them amusing but, in large part, copied from the French prankster [[Alfred Jarry]] ("the technique of ''[[Ubu Roi|Ubuesque]]'' humorists").&lt;ref name="gc564"/&gt; Both Anton and Constantin Bacalbașa were also early pioneers of the Romanian [[epigram]] genre, which the former helped popularize at ''Moftul''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Liviu Grăsoiu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/GRASOIUapr3.html "Cu toată seriozitatea despre epigramă"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Bacalbașa's writings are of a more restrained nature, and even include somber pieces. A younger colleague, C. Cosco, recalled: "We [journalists] knew that, under his ferocious sarcasm, under his biting wit, he was hiding the sentimentality of a German maiden."&lt;ref name="cc114"/&gt; In his more serious poems, Toni follows the model set by ''Junimea''{{'}}s [[Mihai Eminescu]].&lt;ref name="gc564"/&gt; In a controversial article he wrote in 1890, Toni asserted that Eminescu was a unique genius, who did not fit in with any school of literature.&lt;ref&gt;C. Popescu-Cadem, ''Titu Maiorescu în fața instanței documentelor'', Editura Biblioteca Bucureștilor, 2004, p.224.  {{ISBN|973-8369-16-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Stamp 1965 Anton Bacalbasa.jpg|thumb|200px|Anton Bacalbașa on a 1965 Romanian stamp]]
Following Toni's death, Alexandrina Bacalbașa remarried, to the Transylvanian literato [[Nerva Hodoș]].&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi, p.154; Călinescu, p.564&lt;/ref&gt; She survived her second husband by several decades. When she died, in 1954, she was buried next to her first husband.&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi, pp.58, 154&lt;/ref&gt;

A final ''Moș Teacă'' [[almanac]] was put out in 1900, featuring the sketch ''Ion prostul'' ("Stupid Ion"), which, although believed by the publisher to be Bacalbașa's work, may in fact be a forgotten contribution by Caragiale.&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, pp.43–46&lt;/ref&gt; At around that time, [[George Ranetti]] also tried to revive ''Moș Teacă'' magazine, and continued to write humorous pieces in the manner introduced by Caragiale and Toni (a subject-matter that Călinescu has named ''Moftology'').&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.728&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moș Teacă'' grew in scope, and began publishing satires of Christianity. These earned it a poor reputation in the media, created a political controversy, and nearly resulted in a trial of Ranetti.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/tribunapoporului/1900/BCUCLUJ_FP_P2514_1900_004_0002.pdf "Depravație morală"], in ''Tribuna Poporului'', Nr. 2/1900, pp.2–3; [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/tribunapoporului/1900/BCUCLUJ_FP_P2514_1900_004_0012.pdf "Din Romania.

A patra putere: Caragiale'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 2011, p.47.  {{ISBN|978-973-50-2954-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bacalbașa genre had other significant effects on [[Romanian literature]], and in particular on [[Romanian humor|comedy-writing]]. ''Moș Teacă'' proved influential for the work of other Romanian writers, who were active in the [[interwar period]]: [[Gheorghe Brăescu]], then [[Neagu Rădulescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp.782, 929&lt;/ref&gt; The name itself was virtually turned into a common noun (''un moș teacă''), applied to army men who are thought to display the same characteristics as Bacalbașa's anti-hero.&lt;ref name="hgporecle"/&gt; In [[Romanian cuisine]], the writer's name was given to a ''[[delicatessen]]'' variety of [[smoked ham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioana Mitu, [http://www.zf.ro/dupa-afaceri/inapoi-in-bucataria-traditionala-3781177 "Înapoi la bucătăria tradițională"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', January 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Kirițescu and Cosco's notes, Toni was the subject of a 1924 monograph by socialist critic [[Barbu Lăzăreanu]], and of a 1938 memoir by his ''Adevărul'' acquaintance [[Izabela Sadoveanu-Evan]].&lt;ref name="gc1006"/&gt; In the 1930s, the aged [[Constantin Stere]] wrote his deceased friend into the autobiographical novel ''În preajma revoluției'', as ''Toni [[Baclava]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alexandru Burlacu]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/BURLACUi.htm "Modelele prezumtive în romanul lui C. Stere" (I)], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', January 2002; Călinescu, p.761&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1948, Bacalbașa's republicanism made him a favorite of the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]]. In the 1950s, his anti-monarchic work was central to the [[Education in Romania|Romanian curriculum]], alongside selected pieces by other hand-picked republicans-socialists ([[N. D. Cocea]], [[Traian Demetrescu]], [[Dumitru Theodor Neculuță]], [[Alexandru Toma]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Andrei Grigor, Simona Marin, [http://www.revistatransilvania.ro/nou/ro/anul-editorial-2009/cat_view/45-anul-editorial-2011.html "Literatura română în școala anilor cincizeci"], in ''Transilvania'', Nr. 1/2011, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; However, the anonymous ''Moftul Român'' articles which were evidently pro-socialist, and which are most likely Toni's contributions, were attributed to Caragiale by official authors such as [[Camil Petrescu]]. This was a counter-factual effort of transforming the ''Junimist'' writer into a champion of the left.&lt;ref name="astovcamil"/&gt;

'''Benjamin Henry Boneval Latrobe''' (May 1, 1764 – September 3, 1820) was a British [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] [[architect]] who emigrated to the [[United States]]. He was one of the first formally trained, professional architects in the new United States, drawing on influences from his travels in Italy, as well as British and [[Neoclassical architecture#France|French Neoclassical]] architects such as [[Claude Nicolas Ledoux]]. In his thirties, he emigrated to the new [[United States]] and designed the [[United States Capitol]], on "[[Capitol Hill]]" in [[Washington, D.C.]], as well as the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary|Old Baltimore Cathedral or The Baltimore Basilica]], (later renamed the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary). It is the first [[Roman Catholic]] Cathedral constructed in the United States. Latrobe also designed the largest structure in America at the time, the "Merchants' Exchange" in Baltimore. With extensive balconied atriums through the wings and a large central rotunda under a low dome which dominated the city, it was completed in 1820 after five years of work and endured into the early twentieth century.

Latrobe emigrated in 1796, initially settling in [[Virginia]] where he worked on the [[Virginia Department of Corrections|Virginia State Penitentiary]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. Latrobe then moved to [[Philadelphia]] where he established his practice. In 1803, he was hired as Surveyor of the Public Buildings of the United States, and spent much of the next fourteen years working on projects in the new national capital of [[Washington, D.C.]], (in the newly-laid out Federal capital of the [[District of Columbia]]) where he served as the second [[Architect of the Capitol]]. He also was responsible for the design of the [[White House]] porticos. Latrobe spent the later years of his life in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana working on a waterworks project, and died there in 1820 from [[yellow fever]].

Latrobe has been called the "father of American architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ravetz |first=Alison |url=http://www.c-span.org/Events/C-SPAN-Event/10737429148/ |title=Benjamin Henry Latrobe: "Father of American Architecture" |publisher=C-SPAN |accessdate=11 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212150109/http://www.c-span.org/Events/C-SPAN-Event/10737429148/ |archivedate=12 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the uncle of [[Charles La Trobe]], who was the first [[Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria]] in [[Australia]].

==Biography==
[[File:BlakeCollectionDuettsTitle.png|thumb|upright|right|An engraving (circa 1807) by [[George E. Blake]] of Latrobe's Center Square Water Works in Philadelphia]]
Latrobe was born on May 1, 1764, at the [[Fulneck Moravian Settlement]], near [[Pudsey]] in the city of [[Leeds]], in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], England. His parents were [[the Reverend]] Benjamin Latrobe, a leader of the [[Moravian Church]] who was of [[Huguenot]] (French [[Protestant]]) ancestry, and Anna Margaretta Antes to a [[Germans|German]] father and maternal Dutch descent.&lt;ref name="journal-pVII"&gt;{{harvnb|Latrobe|1905|p=VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antes was born in the American colony of [[Pennsylvania]], but was sent to England by her father, a wealthy landowner, to attend a Moravian school at Fulneck.

Latrobe's father, who was responsible for all Moravian schools and establishments in Britain, had an extensive circle of friends in the higher ranks of society. He stressed the importance of education, scholarship, and the value of social exchange; while Latrobe's mother instilled in her son a curiosity and interest in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|pp=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a young age, Benjamin Henry Latrobe enjoyed drawing landscapes and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a brother of Moravian leader and musical composer [[Christian Ignatius Latrobe]].

In 1776, at the age of twelve, Latrobe was sent away to a Moravian School at [[Niesky]] in [[Upper Lusatia]], near the border of the German principalities of [[Saxony]] and [[Prussia]], where his brother was studying.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latrobe|1979}}{{full citation needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age eighteen, he spent several months traveling around Germany, and then joined the [[Royal Prussian Army]], becoming close friends with a distinguished officer in the [[United States Army]]. Latrobe also may have served briefly in the [[Imperial and Royal Army during the Napoleonic Wars|Austrian Imperial Army]], and suffered some injuries or illness.&lt;ref name="journal-pX"&gt;{{harvnb|Latrobe|1905|p=X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|pp=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After recovering, he embarked on a continental "[[Grand Tour]]", visiting eastern Saxony, [[Paris]], [[Italy]], and other places.&lt;ref name="hamlin-p16"&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his education and travels, Latrobe mastered German, French, ancient and modern Greek, and Latin. He had advanced ability in Italian and Spanish and some knowledge of Hebrew.&lt;ref name="hamlin-p17"&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latrobe was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistl American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

His son, [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe, II]], (sometimes referred to as "Junior"), also worked as a civil engineer. In 1827, he joined the newly organized [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] and designed the longest, most challenging bridge on its initial route: the curving [[Thomas Viaduct]], (the third of four multi-arched "[[viaduct]]s").&lt;ref name="herb.harwood"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harwood |first=Herbert H., Jr. |title=Impossible Challenge II: [[Baltimore]] to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]] on the [[Potomac River]] from 1828 to 1994 |year=1994 |publisher=Barnard, Roberts &amp; Co. |location=Baltimore, MD |isbn=0934118221|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another son, [[John Hazlehurst Boneval Latrobe]] (1803–91), was a noted civic leader, lawyer, author, historian, artist, inventor, intellectual, and social activist in [[History of Maryland|Maryland]]. 

A grandson, [[Charles Hazlehurst Latrobe]] (1834–1902), Benjamin Henry Latrobe II's son, a Confederate soldier,&lt;ref&gt;"Latrobe, Charles Hazelhurst", in ''Concise [[Dictionary of American Biography]]'' (1964), New York: Scribner's.&lt;/ref&gt; also continued the tradition of architect and engineer, building bridges for the city and the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]]. [[Latrobe Park, Baltimore|Latrobe Park]] in south Baltimore is named for the family, as is [[Latrobe Park, New Orleans]], in the [[French Quarter]].

==Travels==

===England===
Latrobe returned to England in 1784, and was apprenticed to [[John Smeaton]], an engineer known for designing [[Eddystone Lighthouse]].&lt;ref name="hamlin-p16" /&gt; Then in 1787 or 1788, he worked in the office of [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architect [[Samuel Pepys Cockerell]] for a brief time.&lt;ref name="journal-pXI"&gt;{{harvnb|Latrobe|1905|p=XI}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790, Latrobe was appointed Surveyor of the Public Offices in London, and established his own private practice in 1791.&lt;ref name="journal-pXI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamlin 1955 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latrobe was commissioned in 1792 to design [[Hammerwood Park|Hammerwood Lodge]], near [[East Grinstead]] in [[Sussex]], his first independent work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hammerwood.mistral.co.uk/latrobe.htm |title=Benjamin Henry Latrobe |publisher=Hammerwood Park}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he designed nearby [[Ashdown House, East Sussex|Ashdown House]] in 1793.&lt;ref name="colvin"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Biographical Dictionary of English Architects, 1660–1840 |author=Colvin, H. M. Colvin |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1954 |pages=357 |isbn=0-7808-0042-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latrobe was involved in construction of the [[Basingstoke Canal]] in [[Surrey]], together with engineers [[John Smeaton]] and [[William Jessop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fazio|Snadon|2006|p=601}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Formwalt|1979|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 1793, Latrobe was hired to plan improvements to the River Blackwater from Maldon to Beeleigh, so that the port of Maldon could compete with the [[Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation]], which bypassed the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Canals of Eastern England |author1=John Boyes  |author2=Ronald Russell  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=David and Charles |year=1977 |isbn=978-0-7153-7415-3 |pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project lasted until early 1795, when Parliament denied approval of his plan. Latrobe had problems getting payment for his work on the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Formwalt|1979|pp=16–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and faced bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="hamlin-p34"&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1790, Latrobe married Lydia Sellon, and they lived a busy social life in London. The couple had a daughter (Lydia Sellon Latrobe) and a son ([[Henry Sellon Boneval Latrobe]]), before she died giving birth during November 1793.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lydia had inherited her father's wealth, which in turn was to be left to the children through a trust with the children's uncles, but never ended up going to the children.&lt;ref name="hamlin-p30"&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1795, Latrobe suffered a breakdown and decided to emigrate to America, departing on November 25 aboard the ''Eliza''.&lt;ref name="hamlin-p34"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, Latrobe was known for his series of topological and landscape watercolors; the series started with a view of the White Cliffs of the south coast of England viewed from the ''Eliza''. The series was preceded by a watercolor of East Grinstead, dated September 8, 1795.

===Virginia===
[[File:Benjamin Henry Latrobe by Filippo Costaggini.jpg|thumb|left|Benjamin Henry Latrobe, by Filippo Costaggini]]
Latrobe arrived in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], in mid-March 1796 after a harrowing four-month journey aboard the ship, which was plagued with food shortages under near-starvation conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|pp=54–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latrobe initially spent time in Norfolk, where he designed the "William Pennock House," then set out for [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in April 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fazio|Snadon|2006|pp=210–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after arriving in Virginia, Latrobe became friends with [[Bushrod Washington]], nephew of President [[George Washington]], along with [[Edmund Randolph]] and other notable figures.&lt;ref name="journal-pXVII"&gt;{{harvnb|Latrobe|1905|p=XVII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Bushrod Washington, Latrobe was able to pay a visit to [[Mount Vernon]] to meet with the president in the summer of 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|pp=75–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latrobe's first major project in the United States was the State Penitentiary in Richmond, commissioned in 1797.&lt;ref name="Formwalt 1977 388"&gt;{{harvnb|Formwalt|1977|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; The penitentiary included many innovative ideas in [[penal reform]], then being espoused by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and various other figures, including cells arranged in a semicircle, similar, but not identical to [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[panopticon]], that allowed for easy surveillance, as well as improved living conditions for sanitation and ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Concise History of American Architecture |author=Roth, Leland M. |publisher=Westview Press |year=1980 |pages=67 |isbn=0-06-438490-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also pioneered the use of solitary confinement in the Richmond penitentiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frary|1969|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Virginia, Latrobe worked on the [[Green Spring Plantation|Green Spring]] mansion near [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], which had been built by Governor Sir [[William Berkeley (governor)|William Berkeley]] in the seventeenth century but fell into disrepair after the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/green-spring-plantation.htm |title=Historic Jamestown, Green Spring Plantation |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latrobe created designs for [[Fort Nelson (Virginia)|Fort Nelson]] in Virginia in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fortress America: The Forts That Defended America, 1600 to the Present |last=Kaufmann |first=J.E. |first2=H.W. |last2=Kaufmann |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2007 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/designs_for_democracy/symbols_and_substance/symbols_and_substance_page_1.html |title=Designs for Democracy |publisher=National Archives and Records Administration |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also made drawings for a number of houses that were not built, including the "Mill Hill" plantation house near Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hamlin|1955|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending a year in Virginia, the novelty of being in a new place wore off, and Latrobe was lonely and restless in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giambattista Scandella]], a friend, suggested [[Philadelphia]] as an ideal location for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1798, Latrobe visited [[Philadelphia]] for the first time, meeting with [[Bank of Pennsylvania]] president Samuel J. Fox, and presented to him a design for a new bank building. At the time, the political climate in Philadelphia was quite different than Virginia, with a strong division between the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] and Jefferson's [[Democratic-Republican]]s, along with anti-French sentiment, thus the city was not entirely welcoming for Latrobe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hamlin|1955|pp=128–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his way to Philadelphia, Latrobe passed through the national capital city of [[Washington, D.C.]], then under construction (congress and the president would not arrive until the year 1800), where he met with the first architect of the capitol, [[William Thornton]], and viewed the United States Capitol for the first time. He stopped by Washington again on his way back to Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hamlin|1955|pp=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latrobe remained in Richmond, Virginia, until November 1798, when his design was selected for the Bank of Pennsylvania. He moved to [[Philadelphia]], so that he could supervise the construction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Latrobe|1905|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="journal-pXIV"&gt;{{Harvnb|Latrobe|1905|p=XIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he continued to do occasional projects for clients in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hamlin|1955|pp=110–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philadelphia===
[[File:Birch2ndbankpa.jpg|thumb|[[Bank of Pennsylvania]], Philadelphia - engraving by [[William Russell Birch]]]]
By the time he arrived in Philadelphia, Latrobe's two friends, Scandella and Volney, had left due to concerns regarding the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], but Latrobe made friends with some of their acquaintances at the [[American Philosophical Society]]. Latrobe submitted several papers to the society, on his geology and natural history observations, and became a member of the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his charming personality, Latrobe quickly made other friends among the influential financial and business families in Philadelphia, and became close friends with [[Nicholas Roosevelt (inventor)|Nicholas Roosevelt]], a talented steam-engine builder who would help Latrobe in his waterworks projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hamlin|1955|pp=134–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latrobe's first major project in Philadelphia was to design the Bank of Pennsylvania, which was the first example of [[Greek Revival]] architecture in the United States. It was demolished in 1870.&lt;ref name="philabldgs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/ar_display.cfm/25618 |title=Biography from the American Architects and Buildings database |publisher=Philadelphia Architects and Buildings}}&lt;/ref&gt; This commission is what convinced him to set up his practice in Philadelphia, where he developed his reputation.&lt;ref name="tatum-p59"&gt;{{harvnb|Tatum|1961|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latrobe also was hired to design the [[Center Square Water Works]] in Philadelphia. The Pump House, located on the common at Broad and Market Streets (now the site of [[Philadelphia City Hall]]), was designed by Latrobe in a Greek Revival style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tatum|1961|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; It drew water from the [[Schuylkill River]], a mile away, and contained two steam engines that pumped it into wooden tanks in its tower. Gravity then fed the water by wooden mains into houses and businesses. Following his work on the Philadelphia water works project, Latrobe worked as an engineer of the [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]].&lt;ref name="Formwalt 1977 388"/&gt;

In addition to Greek Revival designs, Latrobe also used [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] designs in many of his works, including the 1799 design of [[Sedgeley]], a country mansion in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tatum|1961|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gothic Revival style was used in Latrobe's design of the Philadelphia Bank building as well, which was built in 1807 and demolished in 1836.&lt;ref name="tatum-p76"&gt;{{harvnb|Tatum|1961|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young architect, [[Robert Mills (architect)|Robert Mills]] worked as an assistant with Latrobe from 1803 until 1808 when he set up his own practice.&lt;ref name="tatum-p64"&gt;{{harvnb|Tatum|1961|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Philadelphia, Latrobe married Mary Elizabeth Hazlehurst (1771–1841), in 1800.&lt;ref name="philabldgs"/&gt; The couple had several children together.

===Washington, D.C.===
In the United States, Latrobe quickly achieved eminence as the first professional architect working in the country.&lt;ref name=roth&gt;{{cite book |first=Leland M. |last=Roth |year=1993 |title=Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History and Meaning |edition=First |publisher=Westview Press |location=Boulder, CO |isbn=0-06-430158-3 |pages=117–18, 415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latrobe was a friend of [[Thomas Jefferson]], likely influencing Jefferson's design for the [[University of Virginia]]. Latrobe also knew [[James Monroe]], as well as [[New Orleans]] architect and pirate, [[Barthelemy Lafon]], was [[Aaron Burr]]'s preferred architect, and he trained architect [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]].&lt;ref name=roth/&gt;

In 1803, Jefferson hired Latrobe as [[Surveying|Surveyor]] of the Public Buildings of the United States, and to work as superintendent of construction of the [[United States Capitol]].&lt;ref name="Carter 1972 128"&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1972|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; As construction of the capitol was already underway, Latrobe was tasked to work with [[William Thornton]]'s plans,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frary|1969|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Latrobe criticized. In an 1803 letter to Vice President [[Aaron Burr]], he characterized the plans and work done as "faulty construction".&lt;ref name="journal-p117"&gt;{{harvnb|Latrobe|1905|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, President [[Thomas Jefferson]] insisted that Latrobe follow Thornton's design for the capitol.&lt;ref name="dumbauld-p75"&gt;{{harvnb|Dumbauld|1980|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Latrobe Gate, Washington Navy Yard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Latrobe Gate]] at the [[Washington Navy Yard]]]]
Although Latrobe's major work was overseeing construction of the [[United States Capitol]], he also was responsible for numerous other projects in Washington. In 1804, became chief engineer in the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref name="Carter 1972 128" /&gt; As chief surveyor, Latrobe was responsible for the [[Washington City Canal|Washington Canal]].&lt;ref name="carter-p139"&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1972|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latrobe faced bureaucratic hurdles in moving forward with the canal, with the directors of the company rejecting his request for stone [[Lock (water transport)|locks]]. Instead, the canal was built with wooden locks, which were subsequently destroyed in a heavy storm in 1811.&lt;ref name="carter-p140"&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1972|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latrobe also designed the [[Latrobe Gate|main gate]] of the [[Washington Navy Yard]].&lt;ref name="latrobefamily"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latrobefamily.com/gedpage/nti/nti00001.htm |title=Latrobe Family – Benjamin Henry Latrobe |author=Latrobe Jr., John H.

[[File:Latrobe White House cropa2.jpg|right|thumb|Principal story plan for the [[White House]] by Benjamin Henry Latrobe, 1807]]
Benjamin Latrobe was responsible for several other projects located around [[President's Park#Lafayette Square|Lafayette Square]], including [[St. John's Episcopal Church, Washington, D.C.|St. John's Episcopal Church]], [[Decatur House]], and the [[White House]] porticos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decaturhouse.org/museum/spaces.htm |title=Public, Private and Service Spaces at Decatur House |publisher=Decatur House Museum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216174119/http://decaturhouse.org/museum/spaces.htm |archivedate=2007-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Private homes designed by Latrobe include commissions by [[John P. Van Ness]] and [[Peter Casanove]].&lt;ref name="formwalt-p38"&gt;{{harvnb|Formwalt|1980|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1812, construction of the Capitol came to a halt with the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]] and the failure of the [[First Bank of the United States]].&lt;ref name="carter-p141"&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1972|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, Latrobe relocated to [[Pittsburgh]], and returned to Washington in 1815, as [[Architect of the Capitol]], charged with responsibility of rebuilding the capitol after it was destroyed in the war. Latrobe was given more freedom in rebuilding the capitol, to apply his own design elements for the interior.&lt;ref name="dumbauld-p75" /&gt; Through much of Latrobe's time in Washington, he remained involved with his private practice to some extent and with other projects in Philadelphia and elsewhere. His clerk of works, John Lenthal, often urged Latrobe to spend more time in Washington.&lt;ref name="frary"&gt;{{harvnb|Frary|1969|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1817, Latrobe had provided President [[James Monroe]] with complete drawings for the entire building.&lt;ref name="carter-p142"&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1972|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned as [[Architect of the Capitol]] on November 20, 1817, and without this major commission, Latrobe faced difficulties and was forced into bankruptcy. Latrobe left Washington, for [[Baltimore]] in January 1818.&lt;ref name="journal-p150"&gt;{{harvnb|Latrobe|1905|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latrobe left Washington with pessimism, with the city's design contradicting many of his ideals. Latrobe disliked the Baroque-style plan for the city, and other aspects of [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|L'Enfant]]'s plan, and resented having to conform to Thornton's plans for the Capitol Building.&lt;ref name="carter-p149"&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1972|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the greatest problems with the overall city plan, in the view of Latrobe, was its vast interior distances, and Latrobe considered the Washington Canal as a key factor that, if successful, could help alleviate this issue.&lt;ref name="carter-p143"&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1972|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latrobe also had concerns about the city's economic potential, and argued for constructing a road connecting Washington with [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]] to the northwest to enhance economic commerce through Washington.&lt;ref name="carter-p140" /&gt;

===Baltimore===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
[[File:Ext-Night.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]]]]
Latrobe also worked on projects in [[Baltimore]], including the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary|Old Baltimore Cathedral or Baltimore Basilica]], the surviving first Roman Catholic Cathedral constructed in the United States, commissioned by [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]], first Bishop in America for the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|Roman Catholic Diocese of Baltimore]]. Construction of the old Baltimore Cathedral of the Assumption of Mary (later elevated to a Basilica) on Cathedral Hill at Cathedral Street, between West Franklin and Mulberry Streets, commenced in 1806 and the incomplete building was opened in 1821, after several financial setbacks slowed construction.

Latrobe also worked on the "Baltimore Exchange" (also known as the "Merchants' Exchange") project beginning in 1816 to 1819/21/?? – which became the largest domed building in America – an originally planned H-shaped, four-story building facing South Gay Street with its north wing along Second (later Water) Street and its south wing along East Lombard Street. A large, impressive [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] lay under the low dome with a catwalk promenade along the second-floor level of the interior [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], with space for various federal offices of the Customs Service, U. S. Courthouse, Post Office, and a branch of the [[First Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]]; other wings housing an early location of City Hall with offices for the municipal government of [[Baltimore City Hall|Baltimore]]; and offices for shipping companies, brokers, attorneys, and other maritime businesses. On the western wing side (adjacent to Commerce Street), the "Exchange Hotel" of five stories was constructed, which lasted until 1870 when it was replaced by an annex for the Post Office.

As years went by, the city government moved out in 1830 to a temporary City Hall of its own at the old [[Peale Museum]] farther north on Holliday Street (until 1875, when the block-sized current City Hall was dedicated); a new U. S. Courthouse was constructed in 1862–65 (dedicated in 1860??), with President [[James Buchanan]] in attendance, at the northwest corner of East Fayette and North Streets (now Guilford Avenue) – site of old colonial, twin-spired [[First Presbyterian Church and Manse (Baltimore, Maryland)|First Presbyterian Church]]; and in 1889 a newer Federal Courthouse, along with a General Post Office, of Italian Renaissance-style with nine towers including a large central clock tower, for the embellishment of the city, was constructed on the east side of [[Battle Monument]] Square at North Calvert and East Fayette Streets. This was west of the older Civil War-era U. S. courthouse, which was razed in 1907 for an eastern extension-annex of the 1889 Federal Courthouse and Post Office. 

Latrobe's landmark structure, a block north of the waterfront and wharves of "the Basin" (now the "[[Inner Harbor]]") on the northern shore of the northwest branch of the [[Patapsco River]], which forms [[Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore|Baltimore Harbor]], was the site of a number of important events in the nineteenth century, including the 1865 viewing of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s coffin in the rotunda under the low dome, midway in the funeral procession through the streets of the city on its one-day stop in Baltimore, during its week-long journey by train through Northern cities and to [[Springfield, Illinois]], for burial.

The "Exchange" formed the largest commercial structure in America and one of the most important landmarks in nineteenth-century Baltimore. It lasted until unfortunately, being razed around 1902. It was replaced by the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|beaux-arts]] classical granite and marble structure of a new [[United States Custom House (Baltimore, Maryland)|U. S. Customs House]], for which the cornerstone was laid in 1903. Although the [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of February 7–8, 1904, swept over the unfinished foundation along with the entire central business district, construction resumed. The building was dedicated in 1906 and is noted for the beautiful historical maritime murals in its massive "Call Room" in the seldom-seen interior. Over the years, additional [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]] and [[United States Department of Justice|Justice]] Departmental units and agencies have used that building for offices and security details. It was also the location of significant protest demonstrations against the [[Selective Service System]] and against U. S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Latrobe also had hopes of generating more financial capital to use for the waterworks project, completing that project in 1818. He left for [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], in December 1818, arriving on January 10, 1819.

===New Orleans===
Latrobe saw great potential for growth in New Orleans, situated at the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]], with the advent of the [[steamboat]] and great interest in steamboat technology. Latrobe's first project in New Orleans was the first New Orleans United States Customs building, constructed in 1807.

In 1810 Latrobe sent his son, Henry Sellon "Boneval" Latrobe, to the city to present a plan for a waterworks system to the New Orleans city council. Latrobe's plan for the waterworks system was based on that of Philadelphia, which he earlier designed. The system in Philadelphia was created as a response to [[yellow fever]] epidemics affecting the city. Latrobe's system used steam pumps to move water from the [[Schuylkill River]] to a reservoir, located upstream; so that gravity could be used to transmit the water from there to residents in the city. The New Orleans waterworks project also was designed to [[Desalination|desalinate water]], using [[steam-power]]ed pumps. While in New Orleans, Latrobe's son participated in the [[Battle of New Orleans]] and took on other projects including building a lighthouse, a new Charity Hospital, and the [[French Opera House]].&lt;ref name="Donaldson 1987 381-396"&gt;{{harvnb|Donaldson|1987|pp=381–396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Orleans agreed to commission the waterworks project in 1811, although Latrobe was not ready to take on the project immediately and faced financial problems in securing enough investors for the project. His work on the [[United States Capitol]] was completed shortly before the [[War of 1812]] started, ending his source of steady income. During the war Latrobe unsuccessfully tried several wartime schemes to make money, including some steamboat projects. In 1814, Latrobe partnered with [[Robert Fulton]] in a [[steamship]] venture based at [[Pittsburgh]]. While in Pittsburgh, Latrobe designed and built a theater for the [[Circus of Pepin and Breschard]].&lt;ref&gt;Semmes, John Edward. ''John H. B. Latrobe and His Times, 1803–1891''. Baltimore: The Norman Remington Co., 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; After the U. S. Capitol and White House were burned by the British Army, Latrobe remained in Washington to help with rebuilding, and Latrobe's son took on much of the work for the New Orleans waterworks project.&lt;ref name="Donaldson 1987 381-396" /&gt;

Latrobe faced further delays trying to get an engine built for the waterworks, which he finally accomplished in 1819. The process of designing and constructing the waterworks system in New Orleans spanned eleven years. In addition to this project, Latrobe designed the central tower of the [[St. Louis Cathedral, New Orleans|St. Louis Cathedral]], which was his last architectural project.&lt;ref name="Donaldson 1987 381-396" /&gt; 

Latrobe died September 3, 1820, from [[yellow fever]], while working in Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latrobefamily.com/ |title=Latrobe Family |last=Latrobe, Jr. |first=John H.B. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210104820/http://www.latrobefamily.com/ |archivedate=2009-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in the [[Protestant]] section of the [[Saint Louis Cemetery]] in [[New Orleans]], where his eldest son, architect [[Henry Sellon Boneval Latrobe]] (1792–1817), was buried three years earlier, having also succumbed to yellow fever.&lt;ref name="latrobefamily" /&gt;

===Influences===
[[File:Latrobe-Walter-LoC-mosaic.JPG|upright|thumb|For his architectural accomplishments, Benjamin Latrobe is honored, together with [[Thomas U. Walter]], in a ceiling mosaic in the East Mosaic Corridor at the entrance to the Main Reading Room of the [[Library of Congress]].]]
While studying in Germany, Latrobe was mentored by Baron Karl von Schachmann, a classical scholar interested in art and collecting. Around 1783, Latrobe made the decision to become an architect, a decision influenced by the baron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Latrobe was in Germany, a new architectural movement, led by [[Carl Gotthard Langhans]] and others, was emerging with return to more [[Classical architecture|Classical]] or [[Vitruvian]] designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1784, Latrobe set off on a [[Grand Tour]] around Europe, visiting Paris where the [[Panthéon (Paris)|Panthéon]], a church dedicated to St. [[Genevieve]], was nearing completion. The Panthéon in Paris, designed by [[Jacques Germain Soufflot]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Rondelet]], represented an early example of [[Neoclassicism]]. At that time, [[Claude Nicolas Ledoux]] was designing numerous houses in France, in Neoclassical style. Latrobe also visited [[Rome]], where he was impressed by the [[Pantheon, Rome|Roman Pantheon]] and other ancient structures with Greek influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influential architects in Britain, at the time when Latrobe returned in 1784, adhered to a number of different styles. [[William Chambers (architect)|Sir William Chambers]] was at the forefront, designing in [[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]] style, while Chambers' rival, [[Robert Adam]]'s designs had Roman influence, in a style known as [[Adam style]]. Latrobe was not interested in either the Palladian nor Adam style, but Neoclassicalism also was being introduced to Great Britain at the time by [[George Dance the Younger]]. Other British architects, including [[John Soane]] and [[Henry Holland (architect)|Henry Holland]], also designed in the Neoclassical style while Latrobe was in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|pp=35–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his European tour, Latrobe gathered ideas on how American cities should be designed. He suggested [[city block]]s be laid out as thin rectangles, with the long side of the blocks oriented east-west so that as many houses as possible could face south. For a city to succeed, he thought it needed to be established only in places with good prospects for commerce and industrial growth, and with a good water supply. 

Public health was another key consideration of Latrobe, who believed that the eastern shores of rivers were unhealthy, due to prevailing direction of the wind, and recommended cities be built on the western shores of rivers.&lt;ref name="carter-p136"&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1972|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek Revival in America===
Latrobe brought from England influences of British Neoclassicism, and was able to combine it with styles introduced by Thomas Jefferson, to devise an American Greek Revival style. [[John Summerson]] described the Bank of Pennsylvania, as an example of how Latrobe "married English Neo-Classicism to Jeffersonian Neo-Classicism [and] ... from that moment, the classical revival in America took on a national form".&lt;ref name="crook77"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crook|1972|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Summerson|1993|pp=522–527}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American form of Greek Revival architecture that Latrobe developed became associated with political ideals of [[democracy]]—a meaning that was less apparent in Britain.&lt;ref name="crook77"/&gt; The direct link between the Greek Revival architecture and American democracy has been disputed by recent scholars such as W. Barksdale Maynard, who sees the Greek Revival as an international phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;W. Barksdale Maynard, "The Greek Revival: Americanness, politics, and economics," in Eggener, ''American Architectural History: A Contemporary Reader'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Houses===
[[File:Pope Villa (Lexington, Kentucky) - DSC09308.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Pope Villa]]]]

When Latrobe began private practice in England, his first projects were alterations to existing houses, designing [[Hammerwood Park]], and designing [[Ashdown House, East Sussex]]. Alterations completed early in his career may have included Tanton Hall, Sheffield Park, Frimley, and Teston Hall, although these homes have since been altered and it is difficult now to isolate Latrobe's work in the current designs.&lt;ref name="Hamlin 1955 42"/&gt; His designs were simpler than was typical at the time, and had influences of Robert Adam.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Features in his designs often included as part of the front [[portico]]s, Greek [[ionic order|ionic]] columns, as used in Ashdown House,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[doric order|doric]] columns, seen in Hammerwood Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latrobe continued to design houses after he emigrated to the United States, mostly using Greek Revival designs. Four houses still stand that Latrobe designed: the [[Decatur House]] in Washington, D.C.; [[Adena Mansion|Adena]] in Chillicothe, Ohio; the [[Pope Villa]] in Lexington, Kentucky; and the [[Sedgeley#Porter House|Sedgeley Porter's house]] in Philadelphia. As one of Latrobe's most avant-garde designs, the Pope Villa has national significance for its unique design. He also introduced [[Gothic Revival architecture]] to the United States with the design of [[Sedgeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woods|2004|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mansion was built in 1799 and demolished in 1857; however, the stone Porter's house at Sedgeley remains as his only extant building in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fairmountpark.org/Sedgeley.asp |title=Sedgeley (Porter's House) |website=fairmountpark.org |publisher=Fairmount Park |accessdate=2009-01-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006093932/http://www.fairmountpark.org/Sedgeley.asp |archivedate=2008-10-06 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theme seen in many of Latrobe's designs is plans with squarish-dimensions and a central, multi-story hall with a [[cupola]] to provide lighting, which was contrary to the popular trend of the time of building houses with long narrow plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hamlin|1955|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beverley East''' (born 31 May 1953) is a [[graphologist]], a court-qualified forensic document examiner and author.  She works in her home city of [[Washington, DC]], and in [[Jamaica]].

==Education ==
Though born in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], East attended [[Westminster Kingsway College]] in [[London]], graduating with A-levels in English Language, Literature and German and O-levels in British Economic and Social History, German, Italian, English Literature and Language, Sociology

East attended the [[College of Distributive Trades]] in London and earned a degree in CAM Dip (Marketing, PR and Advertising).

She began studying [[graphology]] at the [[International Graphoanalysis Society]] and was certified in 1989. She earned her Master's in Graphoanalysis from the International Graphoanalysis Society. In 1993 she became a Certified [[Questioned document examiner|Questioned Document Examiner]] (QDE) for the National Bureau of Questioned Document Examiners in [[New York, NY]].

==Career==
East trained and apprenticed in Forensic Document Examination by Felix Klein (1911&amp;ndash;1994), the founder of the National Society for Graphology and the founder of the National Bureau of Document Examiners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netconnections.name/123/felix/ "Our Founder Felix Klein"], Felix Klein School of Graphology.&lt;/ref&gt;

She authenticated handwriting on the labels of 1,700-item butterfly collection assembled by naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] for the then-owner of the collection, attorney Robert Haggestad, who purchased the collection for $600. Haggestad asked East to authenticate the handwriting, which she did. The collection was later purchased by the [[Smithsonian]] for a substantial sum ($4.5 million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://quigleyscabinet.blogspot.com/2010/07/cabinet-of-alfred-russel-wallace.html "Cabinet of Alfred Russel Wallace"] Quigley’s Cabinet, 10 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alison Frankel, [http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2009/02/as-the-world-celebrates-darwins-200th-birthday-a-troutman-sanders-lawyer-discovers-a-treasure-that-c.html "Troutman Sanders Lawyer's Beetle Mania Earns Place in History of Science"], ''AM Law Daily'', 12 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

East was the handwriting expert in the 2012 court case of the [[Jamaican Stone Crusher Gang]], where police fabricated witness statements against members. Accused gang members were later released because of the evidence being false.&lt;ref&gt;Janice Budd, "Fraudbuster: How local handwriting expert exposed forged murder witness statement", ''The Sunday Observer'' (Jamaica), 12 February 2012, pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Gayle, [http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120204/lead/lead1.html "Fabricated - Stone Crusher gang members freed on fake evidence"], ''Jamaica Gleaner'', 4 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

East has also been asked by the media to comment on the handwriting of news worthy events. In 1998, "The Reliable Source", a respected ''[[Washington Post]]'' column, asked her to review [[Monica Lewinsky]]’s handwriting. East was also asked to comment on handwriting samples from the [[anthrax attacks|anthrax mailings]] case for a [[National Geographic Channel]] documentary.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/episodes/hunting-the-anthrax-killer/ "Hunting the Anthrax Killer"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502111601/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/episodes/hunting-the-anthrax-killer/ |date=May 2, 2013 }}, National Geographic Channel.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being a leading authority in handwriting analysis, East is an author. In June 2014, she was named by ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine as one of "six Caribbean writers you should take some time to discover" (alongside [[Mervyn Morris]], [[Andrea Stuart]], Ann-Margaret Lim, Roland Watson-Grant, and [[Tiphanie Yanique]],&lt;ref&gt;Kristin Braswell, [http://www.ebony.com/entertainment-culture/6-caribbean-writers-to-discover-this-summer-504#axzz3PTd8kfFg "6 Caribbean Writers to Discover This Summer"], ''Ebony'', June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Johnson, [http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Ebony-hails-Caribbean-poets_17041407 "Ebony hails Caribbean poets"], ''Jamaica Observer'', 29 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; who were attending the Calabash Literary Festival in Jamaica). her first book, ''Finding Mr. Write: A New Slant on Selecting the Perfect Mate'' (2000), became a bestseller after it received major media coverage, including East being interviewed by [[Diane Sawyer]] on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calabashfestival.org/2014/authors.html Authors], The 2014 Calabash International Literary Festival.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21969">[[File:Cae halle germany 2010.jpg|thumb|Critical Art Ensemble in Halle/Saale, Germany performing "Radiation Burn: A Temporary Monument to Public Safety", October 15th 2010.]]'''Critical Art Ensemble''' ('''CAE''') is a collective of five [[tactical media]] practitioners of various specializations including computer graphics and web design, film/video, photography, text art, book art, and performance. For CAE, tactical media is situational, ephemeral, and self-terminating. It encourages the use of any media that will engage a particular socio-political context in order to create molecular interventions and semiotic shocks that collectively could diminish the rising intensity of authoritarian culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.critical-art.net/TacticalMedia.html Critical Art Ensemble]&lt;/ref&gt;
Since its formation in 1987 in Tallahassee, Florida,{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} CAE has been frequently invited to exhibit and perform projects examining issues surrounding information, communications and bio-technologies by museums and other cultural institutions. These include the Whitney Museum and the New Museum in NYC; the Corcoran Museum in Washington D.C.; the ICA, London; the MCA, Chicago; Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt; Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; the London Museum of Natural History; Kunsthalle Luzern, and dOCUMENTA 13.

The collective has written 7 books, and its writings have been translated into 18 languages.

Its work has been covered by art journals, including Artforum, Kunstforum, and The Drama Review. Critical Art Ensemble is the recipient of awards, including the 2007 Andy Warhol Foundation Wynn Kramarsky Freedom of Artistic Expression Grant, the 2004 John Lansdown Award for Multimedia, and the 2004 Leonardo New Horizons Award for Innovation.

==History==

===1986–1990===

Formed in 1987, CAE's focus has been on the exploration of the intersections between art, [[critical theory]], technology, and political activism. In 1986, [[Steve Kurtz]] and Steve Barnes began a collaboration to make low-tech videos with students. They credited each person who contributed to the productions under the signature of Critical Art Ensemble. During the summer of 1987, the group transformed into a broad-based artist and activist collective with six core members: Steve Kurtz, Steve Barnes, Dorian Burr, Beverly Schlee, [[Ricardo Dominguez (professor)]] and Hope Kurtz. In 1987, the group's first multimedia exhibitions were held at Club Nu in Miami and Pappy's Lounge in Jackson, Mississippi. In 1988, the group's first events are produced: ''Political Art In Florida?'' in collaboration with [[Group Material]], and ''Frontier Production'' in collaboration with [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]]. In 1988-89, CAE begin to release their books of plagiarist text poetry (of which there are six in all). In 1989, the group collaborate with [[Gran Fury]] to release ''Cultural Vaccines'', a multimedia event in Tallahassee, Florida, which critiques U.S. policy on HIV. In 1990, the group collaborated with Prostitutes of New York to create ''Peep Show'' which premiered at Window on Gaines in Tallahassee, Florida.

===1991–1995===

In 1991, a body of work titled ''Fiesta Critica'' was developed in Indiantown, Florida, with local migrant workers; addressing Floridian agricultural labour relations. CAE produces an Easter fiesta platform to show the works. In 1992, the group produces ''Exit Culture'' as a series of works developed for [[Highway Culture]]. They also propose ''The Electronic Disturbance'' to [[Autonomedia]] publishers. In 1993, the group is invited to perform their first appearance in Europe at the Audio/Visual Experimental festival in the Netherlands. They complete the associational documentary series ''Apocalypse and Utopia''. In 1994, [[Autonomedia]] publishes ''The Electronic Disturbance'' and construction begins to create CAE's website [http://www.critical-art.net Critical Art Ensemble]. CAE projects begin to appear in both real and virtual forms as the ''Useless Technology'' project is performed as street action and launched online. The concept of electronic civil disobedience is introduced at the ''Terminal Futures'' conference in London. In 1995, the concept of the data body is introduced in lectures at the [[Ars Electronica]]. The group tours around Europe with the performance of ''Body Count''.

===1996–2000===

In 1996, [[Autonomedia]] publishes ''Electronic Civil Disobedience'' (the companion text to ''The Electronic Disturbance''), and research begins for the book ''Flesh Machine''. In 1997, the group tours ''Flesh Frontiers and Shareholder's Briefing''. [[Castelvecchi]] publishes the Italian translation of ''The Electronic Disturbance''. The group goes to [[Documenta X]] in Kassel, Germany to begin the editing and conceptualizing process for the book ''README: Ascii Culture and the Revenge of Knowledge'' at Hybrid Workspace. The performance of ''Flesh Machine'' is toured, premiering in Vienna and closing in Helsinki at Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art in summer 1998. [[L'Eclat]] publishes the French anthology of CAE's writings titled ''La Resistance Electronique''. In 1998, [[Autonomedia]] publishes ''Flesh Machine'' and the German translation is published by Passagen. The group's street action occurs in Sheffield, UK, with the performance of ''The International Campaign for Free Alcohol and Tobacco for the Unemployed''. [[Castelvecchi]] publishes the Italian translation of ''Electronic Civil Disobedience''. In 1999, ''The Society for Reproductive Anachronisms'' is premiered at Rutgers University in the student cafeteria. Work begins on ''Cult of the New Eve'' (CoNE) and is premiered at St. Clara Hospital in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. A new book project is begun, entitled ''Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media''. In 2000, [[Autonomedia]] publishes ''Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media'' and the German anthology of CAE's writings on electronic media is published by Passagen.&lt;ref&gt;
Critical Art Ensemble, 'Timeline', pp. 132-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group has exhibited and performed at diverse venues internationally, ranging from the street, to the museum, to the internet. Museum exhibitions include the Whitney Museum and The New Museum in NYC; The Corcoran Museum in Washington D.C.; The ICA, London; The MCA, Chicago; Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt; Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; and The London Museum of Natural History.

===2003–2004===
Free Range Grain was a performance-based project which tested foods to contest the global food trade system. The project used basic molecular biology techniques over a 72-hour period to test foods that others deemed suspicious of "contamination" even when the authorities were guarding against them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.critical-art.net/Biotech.html Critical Art Ensemble]&lt;/ref&gt; This performance sought to explore biotechnology and the science behind it, as the artists felt it was "one of the most misunderstood areas of production in the cultural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.critical-art.net/FRG.html Critical Art Ensemble]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works and artistic approach==

===Performance style===
In its performances, CAE creates various performative identities, such as that of a group of scientists or a corporation. Instead of using fancy, high-tech machinery they use 'high school lab equipment as well as common household supplies and groceries',&lt;ref name="sholette1"&gt;Sholette 2005, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; which brings the scientific difficulty down to a level at which the public can understand and engage with because the worlds of science and technology in the modern world are 'increasingly privatised'.&lt;ref name="sholette1"&gt;Sholette 2005, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; This playful style, however, contrasts with the groups numerous books and manifestos which have an analytical focus.&lt;ref name="sholette1"&gt;Sholette 2005, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicola Triscott is the founder of [[Arts Catalyst|The Arts Catalyst]]. In her writings about the CAE, she states that their participatory theatre 'aims to involve the public in the processes of biotechnology in order to contribute to the development of an informed and critical public discourse on contemporary bioscience'.&lt;ref name="triscott2"&gt;Triscott 2009, p.151.&lt;/ref&gt; This provides people with knowledge of how science can be interesting and that it can be misused if in the wrong hands. Their works have ranged from genetically modified food, the Human Genome Project (CoNE), reproductive technologies, genetic screening and transgenics. The way they approach this style is through directly engaging with the science and presenting techniques generally unknown to the public in a performative way.&lt;ref name="triscott2"&gt;Triscott 2009, p.151.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The work of the CAE continues to entertain, inform and show the public how biotechnology can be demonstrated via performance.&lt;ref name="sholette1"&gt;Sholette 2005, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; 

:As part of their critical objectives, they target their attention on private corporations unknown in the public sector who misuse biotechnology. This tactical response is what the CAE have termed 'Fuzzy Biological Sabotage' (or FBS if abbreviated).&lt;ref&gt;Sholette 2005, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Using harmless biological species including plants, insects and reptiles, they make sophisticated pranks 'to operate in the grey, in-between spaces as yet unregulated by institutional regimes'&lt;ref&gt;Sholette 2005, p. 52. cited in [http://www.critical-art.net/MolecularInvasion.html ''Molecular Invasion'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===

The collective has written 7 books, and its writings have been translated into 18 languages. Its books include: ''The Electronic Disturbance'' (1994), ''Electronic Civil Disobedience &amp; Other Unpopular Ideas'' (1996), ''Flesh Machine: Cyborgs, Designer Babies, &amp; New Eugenic Consciousness'' (1998), ''Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media'' (2001), ''Molecular Invasion'' (2002), ''Marching Plague'' (2006), and the project book ''Disturbances'' (2012).

CAE is noted for having written the article [http://www.critical-art.net/books/ted/ted2.pdf Nomadic Power and Cultural Resistance], in which CAE argues that with the creation of the [[internet]] the power of the elite has become mobile to the extent that it is difficult for a dissident to directly confront the authority, comparing the untrackable, elusive mobility to that of the [[Scythians]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Electronic Disturbance'', 11-30. New York: Autonomoedia, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; They demolished the idea that power cannot corrupt and co-opt network and hypertext technologies, that such technologies have a predetermined and manifest destiny of freedom.&lt;ref name="reader2003"&gt;The New Media Reader. New York: The MIT, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; CAE goes on to observe that occupation theory &lt;!-- why is there no page on this theory? --&gt;itself is challenged by [[cyberspace]] and the difficulties it presents in terms of focusing a group effort against one authority as opposed to a singular hacker, fiddling with code. An important distinction is made that when rebellious acts are carried out by an individual as opposed to a group in singularity, that the dissenter is seen as a vandal instead of a protester. The article mentions that resistance in the form posters, pamphleteering, street theater and public art have been useful in the past but now that the public is electronically engaged one must bring their resistance methods online.
&lt;ref name="reader2003"/&gt;

===Molecular Invasion===

In correlation to CAE's work "Molecular Invasion (2002)" the collective hosted an exhibit about genetically modified crops. They planted [[Monsanto]]'s genetically modified seeds that were designed to be immune to Monsanto's commercial pesticide [[Roundup (herbicide)|roundup]] (Glyphosate). They successfully grew these crops in their exhibit however once the plants were fully grown they applied an enzyme inhibitor that was reverse engineered to the plants that eradicated the protection that these crops had against the pesticide. The plants quickly died. This exhibit was a statement against genetically modified foods.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Cult of the New Eve===

In 1999, CAE began a new project to draw attention to the ways in which scientific discourses surrounding biotechnologies drew upon promissory religious rhetoric. This participatory performance was titled ''Cult of the New Eve'' (or CoNE when abbreviated) and included a "communion" using a random library of the entire genome of the first female donor to the [[Human Genome Project]] taken from a blood sample. CAE spliced the genome and inserted it into yeast, which was then placed into host wafers and beer given to audience members who were willing to participate. The genome from the donor is intended to represent a 'New Eve… a sacrosant Messiah'.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Art Ensemble 2000, pp.167-173&lt;/ref&gt; The project also offers public and online preaching, baptisms, communion, sacred theological and cosmological texts and prophecies.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Art Ensemble, 'Performing a Cult', pp.167-173&lt;/ref&gt;

===GenTerra===

CAE created a performance titled ''GenTerra'' which raised issues surrounding ethics and safety in performative science. This was done through an investigation into creating transgenic life forms and seeing the consequences of potentially releasing them into the environment. It was the audience members who had to decide whether the bacteria was harmful or not in a game of 'genetic Russian roulette'.&lt;ref name="triscott3"&gt;Triscott 2009, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Triscott states through her own experience of participating in the performance that members of the audience were given the opportunity to grow and store their own bacteria, with full instructions and guidance. With the aid of a spinning machine, bacteria were spun with only one of ten chambers holding active bacteria. The purpose of ''GenTerrra'' is to 'introduce bioproducts to the audience, and demonstrate the practical applications of such research, such as disease treatment and xenotransplantation'.&lt;ref name="triscott3"&gt;Triscott 2009, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; As CAE wear lab-coats and appear as professional scientists, they simulate actual biotechnology corporations, emphasizing their intentions even further.&lt;ref&gt;Triscott 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collective structure===
CAE attributes the collective's longevity to their structure which has contributed to positive attitudes throughout the group. The number of members, ranging from three to eight and known as a 'cellular structure'&lt;ref name="critical1"&gt;Critical Art Ensemble 2001, pp.70-73&lt;/ref&gt; has managed to be sustained without members feeling alienated. As each member has the opportunity to show off their individual strengths and weaknesses, the risk of conflict and mistrust is reduced. They do not believe in equality; rather that every member has 'a voice in the production process [of a project]; however the member with the greatest expertise in the area has authority over the final product'.&lt;ref name="critical1"/&gt;

===Amateurism===
CAE has also stated that amateurs have the ability to see through dominant paradigms, are more free to recombine elements of paradigms thought long dead, and can apply everyday life experience to their deliberations. Most important, however, amateurs are not invested in institutional systems of knowledge production and policy construction, and hence do not have irresistible forces guiding the outcome of their process…'.&lt;ref&gt;Sholette 2005, p.52. cited in Critical Art Ensemble 2001, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future projects===

'Since 2006, CAE has changed the focus of its work towards a critique of US defense policy, and has moved away from its interrogation of biotechnology'.&lt;ref&gt;Triscott 2009, p.166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Steve Kurtz's Trial===
In 2004, one of its founders, [[Steve Kurtz]], was arrested on suspicion of [[bioterrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/arts/design/03kenn.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin|title=The Artists in the Hazmat Suits|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=July 3, 2005|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 11 May 2004, he woke to find that his wife Hope had died in her sleep. He called 911. Police became suspicious after noticing his biology lab which he kept in his own home. They contacted the FBI and Kurtz was detained for 24 hours before being interrogated and his house searched for biohazardous materials. The house was given the all clear, yet a week later, Kurtz's CAE collaborators were ordered to appear before a grand jury to investigate possible violations of the law regarding biological weapons. The jury met in July 2004 and cleared Kurtz of all "bioterrorism" charges, however the FBI continued to press charges against the artist and the case dragged on for four years.&lt;ref&gt;Triscott 2009, p.154.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was widely covered in the US and international press, and sparked outrage among artists and scientists worldwide. A website was created for people to donate money to help Kurtz pay his mounting legal fees. The case was dismissed in 2008. [http://caedefensefund.org -- CAE DEFENSE FUND --] According to Nicola Triscott, the FBI 'thought they had a situation out of which they could manufacture a terrorism case, which potentially brought great personal rewards', based upon the 'Lackawanna Six Sleeper Cell' case where six Yemeni Americans were convicted of supporting al-Qaeda&lt;ref&gt;Triscott 2009, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2312">The '''Dacer–Corbito double murder case''' involves [[unsolved murder]]s in the [[Philippines]] during the administration of [[Joseph Estrada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/671258/mancao-to-finally-tell-truth-on-dacer-corbito-murders (''Inquirer'')], [http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/video/47821/unanghirit/interview-with-sen-lacson-on-dacer-corbito-double-murder-case (GMA Network)]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Salvador "Bubby" Dacer''' (1934–November 2000) was a [[publicist]] from [[Albay]], [[Philippines]]. His clients included many of the top figures in Philippine politics, notably [[President of the Philippines|Presidents]] [[Fidel Ramos]] and [[Joseph Estrada]].

Bubby Dacer and his driver, '''Emmanuel Corbito''', were abducted in [[Makati City|Makati]], the business district of [[Manila]]. They were later killed, and their vehicle dumped. In 2001, a number of arrests were made.

==Background==
The ultimate reasons for Dacer's murder remain a subject of debate. Fidel Ramos has publicly accused his successor, Joseph Estrada, of giving the original order &amp;mdash; Estrada was mired in a [[Political corruption|corruption]] scandal at the time, and according to some reports, Estrada believed Dacer was helping Ramos destabilize his rule.

The murder of Bubby Dacer and Emmanuel Corbito was featured on the 10th episode of the Philippine documentary series ''[[Case Unclosed]]''.

'''Dayanand Sarveshwar Nadkarni''' (1910–2000) was an activist, a freedom fighter, and a [[Member of the legislative assembly]] to the [[Karnataka State]], [[Bangalore]] during 1967-1971 (from Ankola Constituency as a [[Praja Socialist Party]] candidate),&lt;ref&gt;[http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/SE_1967/Statistical%20Report%20Mysore%201967.pdf Election Commission of India Statistical report - 1967 Karnataka state assembly elections] N. D. Sarveshwar&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Veerendra Patil]] was the [[Chief Minister]] of the Karnataka state. Nadkarni was also the founder member of The Kanara Welfare Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kanarawelfaretrust.org/ Kanara Welfare trust.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227232821/http://kanarawelfaretrust.org/ |date=27 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==

D. S. Nadkarni was originally [[Bankikodla-Hanehalli|from Bankikodla]] village. Around 1955, Nadkarni migrated to [[Ankola]] to work with [[Dinakara Desai]]; Nadkarni was right hand-man of Dinakara Desai. Nadkarni was a member of the Rural Education Society of the Chitrapur Saraswats who founded the [[Anandashram High School, Bankikodla|A. H. School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/konkani/prominent_konkanis.htm On Konkani Heritage Album.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Drug king|the South Korean crime film|The Drug King}}
A '''drug lord''', '''drug baron''', '''kingpin''', or '''narcotrafficker''' is a high ranking [[Boss (crime)|crime boss]] who controls a sizable network of people involved in the [[illegal drug trade]]. Such figures are often difficult to bring to justice, as they are normally not directly in possession of something illegal, but are insulated from the actual trade in drugs by several layers of underlings. The [[prosecution]] of drug lords is therefore usually the result of carefully planned infiltration into their networks, often using [[informant]]s from within the organization.

===Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán===
{{Main article|Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán}}
According to the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), Guzmán is the most significant drug lord in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2011/06/15/joaquin-guzman-has-become-the-biggest-drug-lord-ever/ |title=Joaquin Guzman Has Become The Biggest Drug Lord Ever |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is well known for his use of sophisticated tunnels—similar to the one located in [[Douglas, Arizona]]—to smuggle cocaine from Mexico into the United States in the early 1990s. In 1993, a 7.3-ton shipment of his [[cocaine]], concealed in cans of chili peppers and destined for the United States, was seized in [[Tecate]], [[Baja California]]. That same year he barely escaped an ambush by the [[Tijuana Cartel]] led by Ramon Arellano Felix and his gunmen. After being captured in Guatemala, he was jailed in 1993  and in 1995 he was moved to the maximum-security prison called Puente Grande, but paid his way out of prison and hid in a laundry van as it drove through the gates. On 22 February 2014, Guzmán was arrested again. 
He is considered a [[folk hero]] in the narcotics world, celebrated by musicians who write and perform ''[[narcocorrido]]s'' (drug ballads) extolling his exploits.&lt;ref name="WSJ2009-06-13"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124482379191510287 | title = 'He Leads a Gang of Mafioso Gunmen': Songs in Honor of Mexico's 'El Chapo' | accessdate = 2010-12-01 | date = June 13, 2009 | work = The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Los Traviezos recorded a ballad extolling his life on the run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Grayson | first1 = George | title = Mexico: narco-violence and a failed state? | publisher = Transaction Publishers | date = August 31, 2009 | pages = 62–63 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ogjkeCd7RGoC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA63 | accessdate = 2010-12-01 | isbn = 978-1-4128-1151-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, Guzman escaped a second time from a maximum-security prison through a hole in a shower floor that led to a mile-long tunnel, ending at a nearby house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/joaquin-guzman-loera-escapes-mexican-prison|title=Mexican Drug Lord Joaquin Guzman Loera Escapes Prison 2015 : People.com|author=|date=|work=PEOPLE.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large-scale manhunt ensued.

===Jorge Alberto Rodriguez===
Jorge Alberto Rodríguez, also known as Don Cholito, is a notorious Colombian-Puerto Rican drug lord from [[the Bronx]], New York, who headed The 400 criminal organization, a dismantled secret cell of the [[Cali Cartel]]. Pulled into the drug trade at age 12, he left home at age 14 to begin working for his father, [[Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela]], who headed the Cali Cartel.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Within six years he had made hundreds of millions{{clarify|date=September 2017|reason=US$, pesos, what?}} by shipping drugs from Colombia to nearly every U.S. state. He was one of the most-ruthless international drug lords unknown to law enforcement or governments.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} During that time, the nation's{{clarify|date=September 2017|Which nation?  The U.S., Columbia, Puerto Rico?}} murder rate and cocaine-related hospital emergencies doubled.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} He was arrested in 1990 in Tallahassee, Florida and sentenced to a 25-year prison term for a number of federal violations. Following his conviction, Rodriguez continued to operate his illicit business from behind bars, importing as much as {{convert|12,500|kg}}{{clarify|date=September 2017|reason=of what? drugs, cocaine?}} into the U.S. every month and ordering numerous murders of informants, witnesses, and law-enforcement officials in the U.S. and Colombia.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} He reigned and flourished while incarcerated until he was placed in court-ordered high-security isolation in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. vs Jorge Alberto Rodriguez, 981 Federal Reporter 2d, Page 1199&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-04-23/html/E9-9294.htm|title=Federal Register, Volume 74 Issue 77 (Thursday, April 23, 2009)|author=|date=|work=gpo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau Of Prisons Prisoner Registry Number: 09086-017&lt;/ref&gt;

Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria (December 1, 1949 – December 2, 1993) was a [[Colombian People|Colombian]] drug overlord.

===Griselda Blanco===
{{Main article|Griselda Blanco}}
[[File:Griselda Blanco Medellin.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Griselda Blanco]]
Griselda Blanco (1943–2012), known as the "Godmother of Cocaine", was a drug lord who operated between Miami and Colombia during the 1970s and 1980s. During the height of her operation, she smuggled nearly {{convert|3500|lbs|order=flip}} of cocaine into the U.S. every month through a network in south Florida.&lt;ref name="cowboys2"&gt;{{cite video|people=Corben, Billy (director); Cosby, Charles (himself); Blanco, Griselda (herself)|date=July 29, 2008|title=Cocaine Cowboys 2: Hustlin' with the Godmother|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1176726|medium=DVD|publisher=Magnolia Home Entertainment|accessdate=October 3, 2010|ASIN=B00180R03Q|id={{UPC|876964001366}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was noted for her ruthlessness and use of extreme violence, employing tactics such as publicly assassinating people in broad daylight, bayoneting a rival trafficker inside [[Miami International Airport]], and inventing the [[drive-by shooting|drive-by motorcycle shooting]] execution method.&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corben|first1=Billy|title=Griselda Blanco: So Long and Thanks for All the Cocaine|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3b5jz8/griselda-blanco-so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-cocaine|website=Vice|accessdate=24 July 2017|language=en-us|date=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greene|first1=David|title='Godmother' Of Cocaine Trade Murdered In Colombia|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/06/160649616/godmother-of-cocaine-trade-murdered-in-colombia|website=NPR Morning Edition|accessdate=24 July 2017|date=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that she was responsible for the homicides of 200 people in Colombia, Florida, New York, and California.&lt;ref name="vice"/&gt; Arrested in 1985 for drug-trafficking charges, she was subsequently convicted and spent almost 20 years in a U.S. prison.&lt;ref name=Villarreal2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Villarreal|first=Ryan|title=Colombian Drug Lord Griselda Blanco's Life of Violence Comes Full Circle|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/colombian-drug-lord-griselda-blancos-life-violence-comes-full-circle-761125|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was killed by motorcycle hitmen in Colombia on 3 September 2012 as she was coming out of a butcher's shop.&lt;ref name=Godmother&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/godmother-cocaine-colombian-drug-lord-ran-miami-cocaine-empire-70-80-shot-death-motorcycle-gunmen-article-1.1151456|title=Godmother of Cocaine,' Colombian drug lord who ran Miami cocaine empire in 70's and 80's, shot to death by motorcycle gunmen|accessdate=7 June 2013|work=Daily News|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roberto Suárez Gómez===
{{Main article|Roberto Suárez Goméz}}

Pablo Escobar started to buy cocaine from Roberto Suárez in the 1970s when he had just created the [[Medellín cartel]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Suárez started building cocaine laboratories in the middle of the Bolivian Amazon jungle and in the zone of "Los Yungas" in the end of the 1960s and created the first cocaine cartel in Bolivia called "La Corporación".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} At first, the Medellin cartel bought cocaine at $8,000 per kilogram ($3,600/lb). La Corporación then sold cocaine-based paste to Colombian cartels, and they finished and distributed it in the east of the United States.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The finished cocaine was sold directly to Mexican cartels for distribution in the west of the United States. Suárez received untold amounts of money, but as detectives and journalists discovered the corruption between Bolivia and the U.S., the empire Suárez built began to fall.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Suárez was arrested by the DEA in 1988, and Escobar took over of the production and distribution of 80% of the world's cocaine.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Rick Ross===

Law Enforcement Investigations of Ross |publisher=United States Department of Justice Archive |work=USDOJ.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nickname "Freeway" came from Ross growing up next to the 110 [[Harbor Freeway]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} During the height of his drug dealing, Ross was said to have made "$2 million in one day." According to the ''Oakland Tribune'', "In the course of his rise, prosecutors estimate that Ross transported several tons of cocaine to New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere, and made more than $600 million in the process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scott JohnsonOakland Tribune |url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/top-stories/ci_17113312 |title=Oakland Tribune |publisher=Insidebayarea.com |date=2012-04-17 |accessdate=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Ross was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] after being convicted of purchasing more than 100 kilograms of cocaine from a federal agent during a sting operation. Ross became the subject of controversy later that year when a series of articles by journalist [[Gary Webb]] in the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' revealed a connection between Ross's main cocaine source, [[Danilo Blandon]], and the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] as part of the [[Iran–Contra affair]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r1KfHaIF_Y "NBC: Drugs and the CIA"].

==Current trends==
Following the death of [[Pablo Escobar]] in 1993, significant changes occurred in the structure or drug trade, departing from massive cartels such as [[Juan David Ochoa]]'s [[Medellín cartel]]. Drug lords have begun breaking the large cartels into much smaller organizations. In so doing, they decreased the number of people involved and shrank their role as targets—most likely in an attempt to avoid the fate of their predecessors. With newer technology, drug lords are able to manage their operations more effectively from behind the scenes, keeping themselves out of the spotlight and off the FBI and DEA wanted lists. These smaller cartels are slowly proving to be safer and more profitable for those involved.&lt;ref name="NORQUIST"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/specials/0008/organization.profiles/drug.html |title=Special: Drug organization profiles - The Drug Lords |work=CNN |accessdate=October 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029173707/http://www.cnn.com/interactive/specials/0008/organization.profiles/drug.html |archivedate=October 29, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until the demise of Pablo Escobar, in many instances, drug lords essentially ran the governments of the locations they controlled through bribery and assassination. However, this way of controlling their operations is becoming less prevalent. One of the most-notorious examples of the treatment given to drug lords is in the incarceration of Escobar. Although Escobar was, after turning himself in, jailed for his participation in drug trafficking in Colombia, the "jail" in which he was captive was a million-dollar palace built with his own funds. Another famous crime lord who enjoyed lightened jail life was [[Al Capone]], who continued to run his business from his jail cell, which contained tables, chairs, a bed, flowers, and paintings. For drug lords of the past, jail often served as a way to avoid further persecution.

In recent times, drug lords seldomly control local and regional governments, having less influence over their surroundings and their ability to continue to run their businesses from jail.&lt;ref name="Drugss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drugssss"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kershaw |first=Sarah|title=Dizzying Rise and Abrupt Fall For a Reservation Drug Lord |work=New York Times |date= February 20, 2006 |volume=155 |issue= 53496 |page=A1-A10, 2p, 2c. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/20/national/20gena.html?pagewanted=all |agency=Academic Search Premier |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another trend that has been emerging in the last decade is a willingness of local authorities to cooperate with foreign nations, most notably the U.S., in an effort to apprehend and incarcerate drug lords. Recently, especially in the last five years,{{when|date=September 2017}} countries have been more willing to extradite their drug lords to face charges in other countries, an act that not only benefits them directly but also gives them favor with foreign governments. Mexico extradited 63 drug dealers to the U.S. in 2006. However, extradition may be prohibited if the person faces the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Drugs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drugs"/&gt;

==Fraud==
Nwude impersonated [[Paul Ogwuma]], then Governor of the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=im7JonQijyUC&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;ots=pyhrg_CDmW&amp;dq=%22Emmanuel%20Nwude%22&amp;pg=PA162#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=McMafia: A Journey Through the Global Criminal Underworld - Misha Glenny - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully convinced Sakaguchi to "invest" in a new airport in the nation's capital, [[Abuja]], in exchange for a $10 million commission.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In August 1997, the Spanish [[Santander Group|Banco Santander]] wanted to take over the Banco Noroeste Brazil. The fraud was uncovered after a December 1997 joint board meeting, in which an official from Santander inquired about why a large sum of money, two-fifths of Noroeste's total value and half of their capital, was sitting in the Cayman Islands unmonitored.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; This led to criminal investigations in Brazil, Britain, Nigeria, Switzerland, and the United States.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; To guarantee the sale to Santander, the Simonsen and Cochrane families, the owners of Banco Noroeste, paid the $242 million bill themselves. However, Banco Noroeste collapsed in 2001.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3479957.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Bribery warning at '419' trial |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-02-11 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and Trial==
At the request of [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], [[President of Nigeria]], the [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] was created by the [[Nigerian Parliament]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=im7JonQijyUC&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;ots=pyhrg_CDmW&amp;dq=%22Emmanuel%20Nwude%22&amp;pg=PA181#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=McMafia: A Journey Through the Global Criminal Underworld - Misha Glenny - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2004, Amaka Anajemba, Emmanuel Nwude, Emmanuel Ofolue, Nzeribe Okoli, and Obum Osakwe, with Christian Anajemba deceased at this point, were all arrested and charged in the Abuja High Court with 86 counts of "fraudulently seeking advance fees" and 15 counts of [[bribery]] related to the case.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/02/06/1075854068538.html |title=Nigerians charged over scam that sank bank - World |publisher=www.smh.com.au |date=2004-02-07 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They pleaded [[not guilty (plea)|not guilty]]. They were immediately warned off of bribing the court staff by Abuja High Court Judge Lawal Gumi, after he alleged that money was going around.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The defense team assured that "nothing would be done to bring scandal to the administration of justice."&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Four Nigerian companies, Fynbaz, Emrus, Ocean Marketing and the African Shelter Bureau also faced charges and pleaded not guilty.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; In July 2004, Judge Lawal Gumi threw out the case, claiming that since the crime did not take place in [[Abuja]], he had no jurisdiction, and said that the proper place for the case would be the [[Lagos]] High Court.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3909233.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Huge Nigeria scam trial collapses |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-07-20 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants were immediately rearrested after stepping outside the courthouse and the case was moved to Lagos.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; In 2005, Nwudel attempted to bribe [[Nuhu Ribadu]], then head of the commission, with $75,000 cash.

==Murder charges==
On August 19, 2016, the town of Ukpo in the [[Dunukofia]] area was attacked by over 200 people, apparently due to a land dispute with the neighboring [[Abagana]] community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7731">'''Fereydoon Batmanghelidj''' (1930 or 1931 – November 15, 2004) was an Iranian writer. He is best known for his book, ''Your Body's Many Cries for Water'', and his writings related to health and wellness.

==Life and family==
Fereydoon Batmanghelidj was born in Iran in 1930 or 1931.  He attended secondary school in the United Kingdom, at [[Fettes College]] in Scotland, and later graduated from [[St Mary's Hospital Medical School]] of [[London University]].  He then practiced medicine in the United Kingdom, before returning to Iran.&lt;ref name=wpwro&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64133-2004Nov19.html |title=Physician Fereydoon Batmanghelidj; Wrote About Water's Healing |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=20 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There he became a wealthy entrepreneur,&lt;ref name=indcol&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/colourful-character-camila-batmanghelidjh-on-her-unique-approach-to-charity-work-1219607.html |title=Colourful character: Camila Batmanghelidjh on her unique approach to charity work |work=[[The Independent]] |date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping in the development of hospitals and medical centres, and in sports projects, including the Ice Palace ice skating rink in Tehran.&lt;ref name=wpwro /&gt;

In 1979, after the [[Iranian Revolution]], he was sent to [[Evin Prison]].&lt;ref name=nytulc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/21/science/science-watch-doctor-finds-ulcer-remedy-while-in-iran-prison.html |title=SCIENCE WATCH; DOCTOR FINDS ULCER REMEDY WHILE IN IRAN PRISON |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=21 June 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following his release in 1982, he moved to the United States.&lt;ref name=wpwro /&gt;

He married Lucile,&lt;ref name=wpwro /&gt; a Belgian,&lt;ref name=indcol /&gt; and they had four children: Ardeshir, Babak, [[Camila Batmanghelidjh|Camila]],&lt;ref name=wpwro /&gt; and Lila, who committed suicide while he was imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/03/camila-batmanghelidjh-kids-my-family-values |title=Camila Batmanghelidjh: My family values  |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His first marriage ended in divorce.  He later married Xiaopo Huang Batmanghelidj.&lt;ref name=wpwro /&gt;

He died from complications related to pneumonia on 15 November 2004.&lt;ref name=latadv&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/nov/19/local/me-passings19.2 |title=Dr. Fereydoon Batmanghelidj, 73; Advocated 'Water Cure' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=19 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical career==

Batmanghelidj was trained at St Mary's Hospital Medical, and practiced medicine in the United Kingdom before his return to Iran.&lt;ref name=wpwro /&gt;

He claimed that he discovered the medicinal value of water in treating the pain of [[peptic ulcer]]s during his detention in prison by treating inmates with water when medication was not available.  He advanced this position in a guest editorial in the [[Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=nytulc /&gt;

In 1992, he authored ''Your Body's Many Cries for Water''.&lt;ref name=quack&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/batman.html |title=Some Notes on Dr. Batmanghelidj's Silly "Water Cure" |work=[[Quackwatch]] |date=20 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this book, Batmanghelidj asserts that chronic [[dehydration]] is the root cause of most pain and many ailments, opposing the use of drugs to cure conditions that he claimed could instead be addressed by increased water consumption.&lt;ref name=wpwro /&gt;

He has claimed elsewhere that water provides energy for the body and brain, by splitting into its component [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=quack /&gt;

===Criticism===

Batmanghelidj's ideas about water curing all diseases have been criticized as [[quackery]] by medical experts.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;[[Harriet Hall|Hall, Harriet]]. (2010). [https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-water-cure-another-example-of-self-deception-and-the-lone-genius/ "The Water Cure: Another Example of Self Deception and the “Lone Genius”"]. ''[[Science-Based Medicine]]''. Retrieved November 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, Matt. (2014). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Bh1bBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT179&amp;lpg=PT179&amp;dq=%22no+one+in+the+medical+establishment+gave+credence+to+fereydoon%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T4NCOPrMN6&amp;sig=LYkbHzag6fVVg2POjzSSl59Xh18&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwitk_zRs-neAhXHKsAKHbonCHMQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22no%20one%20in%20the%20medical%20establishment%20gave%20credence%20to%20fereydoon%22&amp;f=false ''Diet Cults: The Surprising Fallacy at the Core of Nutrition Fads and a Guide to Healthy Eating for the Rest of Us'']. Pegasus Books. {{ISBN|978-1605985602}} "No one in the medical establishment gave credence to Fereydoon Batmanghelidj's half-baked notions. He had taken the whole hydration thing too far."&lt;/ref&gt; He also drew criticism for his [[HIV/AIDS denialism]].&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; Physician [[Harriet Hall]] has described Batmanghelidj as a "crank who believed dehydration is the main cause of disease. He promoted his Water Cure, which was not based on any scientific evidence."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harriet Hall|Hall, Harriet]]. (2017). [https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/do_i_really_need_to_drink_200_ounces_of_water_every_day "Do I Really Need to Drink 200 Ounces of Water Every Day?"]. ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''. Retrieved November 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

His ideas have been criticized by [[Stephen Barrett]], co-founder of the [[National Council Against Health Fraud]] and the webmaster of [[Quackwatch]], on several grounds, including a lack of any documented peer-reviewed research and exaggerated claims about the number of patients treated successfully.  He further questions that Batmanghelidj has practiced medicine in the United States, pointing to his lack of registration as a physician. He was licensed as a [[naturopath]].&lt;ref name=quack /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3156">'''George Aristotle Economou''' (June 24, 1923 &amp;ndash; April 2, 2003) was an [[United States|American]] [[optics|optical systems]] expert, who helped set up special cameras to photograph and study the first test of the [[atomic bomb]] in 1945. He was instrumental in the development of the atomic bomb at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]], working on the [[Manhattan Project]] under scientific director [[Robert Oppenheimer]]. 

Born in 1923 in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], Economou built his first telescope at the age of 12. After studying [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]] at [[Harvard University]], his career began at the [[Polaroid Corporation]]. In 1944, he joined the [[United States Army]] and was assigned to [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], where he helped conceptualize camera [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] used to photograph bomb tests.

At Contraves, he was later involved in the design of ground station optical instrumentation for [[GEODSS]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelso, T.S.

Economou officially retired in 1990 as Group Vice President, Optical Instruments for the [[Contraves Goerz Corporation]] in [[O'Hara Township, Pennsylvania]], but continued to work on some of the industry's more high-profile projects, such as consulting for design and construction of the [[Large Millimeter Telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/obituaries/20030405economou4.asp Obituary: George A.

'''Grace Duffie Boylan''' (February 9, 1861 - March 24, 1935) was an American [[writer]]. She wrote many children’s books, often dealing with diverse races and cultures, like ''Uncle Tom’s Cabin'' (not to be confounded with the same title by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]). Other titles include: ''Young Folks'', ''Our Little Eskimo Kiddies: Kids of Many Colors'', ''[[Yama Yama Land]]'', and ''Our Little Cuban Kiddies''.

Her ''[[Thy Son Liveth]]: Messages From A Soldier To His Mother'' appeared in 1918 anonymously.&lt;ref Name="Boylan"&gt;{{cite book

This novel served Director [[Peter O'Fallon]] as base for his movie ''[[A Rumor of Angels]]'' (2001), starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]]. The scenario about a boy who learns to cope with the death of his mother by befriending a grumpy old lady who is being transposed to our times.

Boylan was mother to American [[screenwriter]] and [[U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary]] founder [[Malcolm Stuart Boylan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barlow|first1=John F.|title=Gracie Duffie Boylan Mini-biography|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0102161/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm|website=IMDB|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jim Duncan''' (born November 5, 1947) is an American politician who is seeking the Republican party's nomination for [[North Carolina's 2nd congressional district]]. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

==Early life, education, and business career==
Jim Duncan was born the son of a South Carolina native and WWII Sailor turned police officer in New York. Duncan was born New York, New York where his father was serving as a Police Officer.   Duncan says he spent the first 12 years of his life in a [[Queens]] housing project, but later moved "uptown" to [[The Bronx]].  His father was originally from [[Anderson, South Carolina]]. Duncan's mother took a job on the wait staff at a [[Howard Johnson's]] in  [[New York City]]. Jim grew up in modest circumstances, yet because of the hard work of his parents he was able to focus on building a better life and to live the American dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Jim Duncan|url=http://www.jimfornc.com/meet_jim|website=Jim For NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dedicated to his studies, Jim Duncan worked his way through school and became the first person in his family to achieve a higher education degree. Graduating from [[Marist College]] in 1969, Jim decided to follow in his father's footsteps and joined the military serving in the Army National Guard for five years. In business, Jim found his home in the emerging high-tech industry. Jim began working in the High Tech equipment leasing and Disaster Recovery Services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Jim Duncan|url=http://www.jimfornc.com/meet_jim|website=Jim For NC}}&lt;/ref&gt; after college. He worked hard and became successful in his field. He was recognized by Fortune magazine as one of America's greatest sales people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AMERICA'S BEST SALESMEN They want you to be happy. They know how to make you like them. If you're both lucky, you'll know each other a long time|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1987/10/26/69713/index.htm|publisher=Fortune|date=26 October 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned numerous work rewards and Salesman of the year and was further honored by the La Salle Christian Brothers.

He is of Irish, Scotch and Russian origins.

Jim is a member of the Boys and Girls Club of Durham (NC).

==Political career==

===Political Activism===
Jim is a member of the [[Jesse Helms Center]] and a founding member of the Coalition for American Principles (CAP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coalition for American Principles|url=http://www.capofnc.org/index.php/cap-history|website=Coalition for American Principles}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-partisan citizens group devoted to the concept of limited government.

Duncan joined the Chatham GOP team and raised the bar by creating a much larger Republican presence in a county dominated by Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Duncan: A NC grassroots leader to keep an eye on|url=http://dailyhaymaker.com/?p=5193|website=The Daily Haymaker|publisher=Brant Clifton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jim ran for and won the position of Chairman of the Chatham GOP in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Jim Duncan|url=https://about.me/jim_duncan|website=About Me - Jim Duncan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan had a remarkable positive effect on Chatham County's GOP operation from the beginning.  He  was  a leader in orchestrating a conservative takeover of the county board of commissioners and greater conservative representation on the county school board.

In 2013, Jim Duncan considered running for the Second District Congressional seat for the 2014 Election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Source: Chatham GOP's Duncan eyeing primary bid against Ellmers|url=http://dailyhaymaker.com/?p=6145|website=The Daily Haymaker|publisher=Brant Clifton}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the fall of 2013, Jim decided not to run against Ellmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duncan takes a pass on primarying Ellmers|url=http://dailyhaymaker.com/?p=6371|website=The Daily Haymaker|publisher=Brant Clifton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Hadfield''' or '''Hatfield''' (1771/1772 – 23 January 1841) attempted to [[assassination|assassinate]] [[George III of the United Kingdom]] in 1800 but was acquitted of [[attempted murder]] by reason of [[criminal insanity|insanity]].

==Biography==
Hadfield's early years are unknown but he was severely injured at the [[Battle of Tourcoing (1794)|Battle of Tourcoing]] in 1794. Before being captured by the [[France|French]], he was struck eight times on the head with a [[sabre]], the wounds being prominent for the rest of his life. After return to England, he became involved in a [[millennialist movement]] and came to believe that the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]] would be advanced if he himself were killed by the British government. He therefore resolved, in [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] with [[Bannister Truelock]], to attempt the assassination of the King and bring about his own judicial execution.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Eigen (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 15 May 1800, at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], during the playing of the [[national anthem]], Hadfield fired a [[pistol]] at the King standing in the [[royal box]] but missed.  Hadfield was tried for [[high treason]] and was defended by [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine|Thomas Erskine]], the leading [[barrister]] of that era. Hadfield [[insanity defence|pleaded insanity]] but the standard of the day for a successful plea was that the defendant must be "lost to all sense … incapable of forming a judgement upon the consequences of the act which he is about to do". Hadfield's planning of the shooting appeared to contradict such a claim. Due to the [[Treason_Act_1795|1795 Treason Act]], there was little distinction between plotting treason and actually committing treason, thus Erskine chose to challenge the insanity test, instead contending that [[delusion]] "unaccompanied by frenzy or raving madness [was] the true character of insanity". Two [[surgeon]]s and a [[physician]] [[expert witness|testified]] that the delusions were the consequence of his earlier head injuries. The [[judge]], [[Lloyd Kenyon, 1st Baron Kenyon]], at this point halted the trial declaring that the verdict "was clearly an acquittal" but "the prisoner, for his own sake, and for the sake of society at large, must not be discharged".&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v. Hadfield'' (1800) 27 St. Tr. (new series) 1281&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to that time, defendants acquitted by reason of insanity had faced no certain fate and had often been released back to the safe-keeping of their families. Parliament speedily passed the [[Criminal Lunatics Act 1800]] to provide for the indefinite detention of insane defendants (and the [[Treason Act 1800]] to make it easier to prosecute people for attempts on the life of the king). Hadfield later inspired further use of pleading insanity several years later during the case of [[Edward Despard|Colonel Edward Despard]].  Hadfield was detained in [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]] for the rest of his life, save for a short period when he escaped. He was recaptured at [[Dover]] attempting to flee to France and was briefly held at [[Newgate Prison]] before being transferred to the new insane asylum Bethlehem Hospital (or Bedlam, as it was known). He died there of [[tuberculosis]] in 1841.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;  

==Fictional accounts of Hadfield's life==
Hadfield's story is depicted in the [[BBC TV]] period legal drama series in episode 1 of the third series of ''[[Garrow's Law]]'', in which [[William Garrow]] is portrayed as his barrister - however several changes were made from the generally accepted historical facts.

'''Wild Bill Hickok''' (1837–1876), lawman, gunfighter and gambler, of the American [[Wild West]] has been depicted many times and in many forms of media. It is difficult to separate the truth from fiction about Hickok who was the first "[[dime novel]]" hero of the western era, with his exploits presented in heroic form, making him seem larger than life. In truth, most of the stories were greatly exaggerated or fabricated by both the writers and himself.  Along with the frontiersman [[Davy Crockett]], Hickok also became one of the first [[comic book]] heroes.

Official participation in the [[Synod of Dort]], held in 1618–9 in [[Dordrecht]] in the [[Netherlands]], consisted of different groups: Dutch ministers, church elders, and theologians; representatives of churches outside the Dutch Republic; and Dutch lay politicians. There were 14 [[Remonstrants]] who were summoned, in effect as defendants. There were also some observers, who had no voting status.
Listings are usually given according to a traditional ordering for the provinces that begins with Gelderland; for the provincial synods Holland was divided into two, North and South. In the sources both Latinised names and spelling variants occur. Lists of those nominated to participate in some capacity differ from those who signed the final Acts of the Synod. Figures vary a little, but one total given is for 102 official participants.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Mulsow, Jan Rohls, ''Socinianism and Arminianism: Antitrinitarians, Calvinists, and cultural exchange in seventeenth-century Europe'' (2005), p. 38; [https://books.google.com/books?id=E9qBWrLuLsYC&amp;pg=PA38 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of the Synod was the most significant single event in the [[Calvinist-Arminian debate]].

The Dutch members of the Synod were divided up by provincial synods (for the clerics and elders as delegates), or by provinces (for the lay members). Allowing for Holland as exception, the delegates were divided into ten "colleges": one for each of seven provinces, plus [[Drenthe]]; one for theological faculties; and one for the [[Walloon language|Walloon]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;Israel p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dutch lay commissioners==
* [[Jacob de Witt]] (treasurer)

The commissioners by province were:
*Gelderland and Zutphen: Martinus Gregorius, Hendrik van Essen.
*Holland and West Friesland: Walrave de Brederode, Hugo Muys van Holy, Jacobus Boelens, Gerardus van Nieuburg, Rochus van Honaert, Nicholaas Krombout.
*Zealand: Symon Scotte, Jacobus van Kampe.
*Utrecht: Frederik van Zuylen, van Nieuveld, Willem Herteveld.
*Friesland: Ernestus van Aylva, Ernestus ad Harinksma.
*Overijssel: Hendrik van Haagen, Johannes van Hemerde.
*Groningen: Hieronimus Ysbrants, Efaart Jacob Clant, [[Daniel Heinsius]].

Of these Gregorius, van Honaert, Krombout, and Ysbrands were [[doctor of both laws|doctors of both laws]].&lt;ref name=Staat&gt;{{nl icon}} ''Staatkundige historie van Holland: Benevens de Maandelijksche Nederlandsche Mercurius'' (1774) Volumes 36-39 p. 13–5; [https://books.google.com/books?id=iOE1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA13 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; The list of commissioners later signing the Acts of the Synod is somewhat different.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Creeds of the Evangelical Protestant Churches.|author=Schaff, P.|publisher=Ccel|isbn=9781610250399|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vt3JbWlmLoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reformedlayman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reformedlayman.com/SynodOfDort/SynodOfDortSubscribers.htm|title=Synod of Dort -The Subscribers;|publisher=reformedlayman.com|accessdate=2014-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Catalogue of an Invaluable and Highly Interesting Collection of Unpublished Manuscript Historical Documents ...

==Remonstrants==
A number of prominent [[Remonstrant]] ministers were cited to appear before the Synod, around 10% of the 200 identified Remonstrants at that time in the Dutch Reformed Church. Of those, a number were deprived of their church posts before the proceedings, which formed the latter part of the political and religious struggle that had been triggered in 1618, and which came to a head after the Synod closed. Only three Remonstrants were among the delegates (from Utrecht, two ministers and a church elder). [[Simon Episcopius]] emerged as leader of the group of Remonstrants who were summoned. His efforts to secure participation in the debates of the Synod for the group failed after extensive procedural discussion; the summoned Remonstrants were, however, required to remain in Dordrecht. With one exception they refused to subscribe to the required declaration at the end of the Synod, were expelled from the Church, and banished. In total around 70 Remonstrant ministers were banished in the aftermath of the Synod.

[[File:Idea Belgicarum Provinciarum Confaederatarum.jpg|thumb|Allegorical engraving of the Dutch Republic as a ship from 1620, with the [[Stadtholder]] Maurice at the helm.&lt;ref name="xs4all"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pvrooden.home.xs4all.nl/Jo/2011b.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415124144/http://pvrooden.home.xs4all.nl/Jo/2011b.htm |archive-date=2012-04-15 |dead-url=yes |title=Imagining the Synod of Dordt and the Arminian Controversy|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The 14 Remonstrants banished by the Synod were:

*Gelderland: Bernerus Wezekius, Henricus Hollingerus.
*South Holland: Simon Episcopius, [[Iohannes Arnoldi Corvinus]], Bernardus Dwinglonius, Eduardus Popius, Theophilus Rickwaerdius.
*North Holland: Phillippus Pinakerus, Dominicus Sampa.
*Utrecht: Isaacus Frederici, Samuel Neranus.
*Overijssel: Thomas Goswinus, Assuerus Mathisius.
*Walloon churches: [[Carolus Niellius]].

(These are the [[Latinised name]]s as given, correcting two spellings.)&lt;ref name="truecovenanter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truecovenanter.com/gospel/synod_of_dort.html|title=TrueCovenanter.com: The Judgment of the Synod Holden at Dort, Concerning the five Articles: As also their sentence touching Conradus Vorstius.|author=The Synod of Dort|publisher=truecovenanter.com|accessdate=2014-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the Utrecht representative ministers who were Remonstrants–Frederici and Naeranus–these clergy were therefore not full participants in the Synod at any point.

A baseline list of 13 names in ''Historie der Remonstranten'' (1774) by Jacobus Regenboog is of those Remonstrants who were summoned (and omitting the delegates Frederici and Naeranus from the Utrecht provincial synod):

*Gelderland: Henricus Leo of Bommel, Vezekius of Egteld, Hollingerus of Grave.
*South Holland: Episcopius, Arnoldi and Dwinglo of Leiden, Poppius of Gouda, Rykewaard of Brielle.
*North Holland: Pynakker of Alkmaar, Sapma of Hoorn.
*Overijssel: Gozuinus and Mathisius of Kampen.
*Walloon churches: Niellius of Utrecht.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobus Regenboog, ''Historie der Remonstranten, kortelyk vervattende de geschiedenissen der Gereformeerde Christenen, die men Remonstranten noemt'' (1774), p. 13; [https://books.google.com/books?id=WOQ-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA13 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Henricus Leo who was the sole Remonstrant of these summoned who signed the Act of Cessation (''acte van stilstand'') as required by the Synod, and escaped banishment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grotius.huygens.knaw.nl/path/deel_4/1586/ in note 17.] {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; His absence from the first list gives numbers that tally.

There is a longer listing in the works of John Hales of those Remonstrants who were cited by the Synod (21 names, but 20 if Joannes Arnoldi and Corvinus are duplicates); this list includes names of ministers who were by other means removed from their posts. The breakdown by provinces is:&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} John Hales, [[Peter Gunning]], [[John Pearson (bishop)|John Pearson]], ''Golden Remains, of the Ever Memorable Mr. John Hales'' (1688), p. 553; [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEk3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA553 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

*Gelderland: Leo, Wezekius, Holderingus.
*South Holland: Adrianus Bozzius, [[Nicolaus Grevinchovius]], Episcopius, Arnoldi, Poppius, Rickwardus.
*North Holland: Joannes Geysteranus, Sapma.
*Overijssel: Goswinius, Mathisius.
*Walloon churches: Simon Goulartius, Niellius.
*Utrecht: [[Utenbogardus]], Corvinus, Duinghonius, Pinakerus, Neranus, Friderici.

Goulartius ([[Simon Goulart the Younger]] of Geneva, 1575–1628) the Remonstrant was the son of [[Simon Goulart of Senlis]] (1543–1628).&lt;ref&gt;K. A. E.

==Foreign representatives==
There were 27 delegates who attended from outside the Dutch provinces.&lt;ref name=MethRev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/newschaffherzog29haucgoog#page/n514/mode/2up ''New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia'', article Dort, Synod of].&lt;/ref&gt; Two replacements were made during the Synod.

===Imperial delegates===
There was some consideration given to invitations to clergy from Reformed churches in the German principalities and cities of the Empire, with a view to being selective and distinguishing among types of nominally Calvinist church.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Watson, Nathan Bangs, ''A Biblical and Theological Dictionary'' Volume 1 (1832), p. 948; [https://books.google.com/books?id=LcJzS1HTU-kC&amp;pg=PA948 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; Invitations were issued to: the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]], [[Brandenburg]], [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], [[Nassau (state)|Nassau]], [[East Friesland]], [[Hanau]]. [[Anhalt]] was excluded.&lt;ref name="James Isaac Good"&gt;[[James Isaac Good]], ''The Origin of the Reformed Church in Germany'' (1887), p. 407; [https://archive.org/stream/originofreformed00good#page/n433/mode/2up archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg]] declined to send a delegation; the Calvinist–Lutheran relationship in Brandenburg was fragile, and a diplomatic excuse was made. It was later alleged that Anhalt was not invited, for fear that the delegation would be pro-Remonstrant.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p. xviii note 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ljupka Gojić''' (born 4 June 1982) is a [[Croatia]]n [[model (person)|model]] and the face of [[Givenchy]].

==Biography==
When Gojić was 10, she persuaded her mother to take her to a modeling agency where she learned basic steps as a model.  She appeared for the first time on the cover of ''Teen'' magazine (Croatia) in 1995.  Shortly thereafter, accompanied by her parents and Midiken agent, she visited [[Milan]], [[New York City]], and [[Los Angeles]], where she made her breakthrough modeling for Pantene Pro-V.  TV commercials and covers of Croatian magazines soon followed.  At the age of 13, she became the youngest Croatian model to appear on the cover of ''[[ELLE]]'' (The Netherlands).  Her other covers include ''Cosmopolitan'' (Croatian and Czech) and ''Madame Figaro''.

She appeared in a Croatian beauty contest in 1996, placing second runner-up.  She has walked in fashion shows for Issey Miyake, [[Christian Dior]], [[Cacharel]], [[Kenzo]], [[Alexander McQueen]], [[Yohji Yamamoto]], and [[Enrico Coveri]].

She has been featured in advertisements for Anna Molinari, [[Chanel]], [[Chaumet]] Spirit, [[Esprit Holdings|Esprit]], [[Armani]], [[Mango]], and [[Gap (clothing)|GAP]].  In 2006, she became a spokesmodel for [[Givenchy]].&lt;ref name="fmd"/&gt; She is currently married to a [[Croatia]]n [[Association football|football player]] [[Mihael Mikić]].

'''Lloyd Lionel Gaines''' (1911, [[Water Valley, Mississippi]]  &amp;ndash; disappeared March 19, 1939, [[Chicago]]) was the [[plaintiff]] in ''[[Gaines v. Canada]]'' (1938), one of the most important court cases in the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1896-1954)|U.S. civil rights movement]] in the 1930s. After being denied admission to the [[University of Missouri School of Law]] because he was black and refusing the university's offer to pay for him to attend another neighboring state's law school with no racial restriction, he filed suit. The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ultimately ruled in his favor, [[holding (law)|holding]] that the [[separate but equal]] doctrine required that Missouri either admit him or set up a separate law school for Black students.

The [[Missouri General Assembly]] chose the latter option, converting a former cosmetology school in [[St. Louis]] to the [[Lincoln University School of Law]], to which other, mostly black, students were admitted. The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), which had supported Gaines' suit, planned to file another suit challenging the adequacy of the new law school. While he waited for classes to begin, Gaines traveled between St. Louis, [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and [[Chicago]] looking for work, doing odd jobs and giving speeches before local NAACP chapters. One night in Chicago he left the [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternity]] house where he was staying to buy stamps and never returned.

Gaines' disappearance was not noted immediately, since he would frequently travel on his own for long periods of time without informing anyone. Only in the autumn of that year, when the NAACP's lawyers were unable to locate him to take [[deposition (law)|deposition]]s for a rehearing in state court, did a serious search begin. It failed, and the suit was dismissed. While most of his family believed at the time that he had been murdered in retaliation for his legal victory, there has been some speculation that Gaines had tired of his role in the civil rights movement and simply went elsewhere, either [[New York City|New York]] or [[Mexico City]], to start a new life. In 2007 the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) agreed to look into the case, among many other unsolved missing persons cases related to the civil rights era.

Despite his unknown fate, Gaines has been honored by the University of Missouri School of Law and the state. The Black Culture Center at the [[University of Missouri]] and a law scholarship at the law school are named for him and another black student initially denied admission, and in 2006 he was granted an honorary law degree. The state [[bar association]] followed with a posthumous law license. A portrait of Gaines hangs in the University of Missouri law school building.

==Early life==

Born in 1911 in [[Water Valley, Mississippi]], Gaines moved with his mother and siblings to St. Louis in 1926 after the death of his father, settling in the city's [[Central West End, St. Louis|Central West End]] neighborhood. He did well academically, and was a [[valedictorian]] at [[Vashon High School]]. After winning a $250 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|250|1929|r=-3}}}} in modern dollars){{Inflation-fn|US}} scholarship&lt;ref name="NYT story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stout|first=David|title=A Supreme Triumph, Then Into the Shadows|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/us/12gaines.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 11, 2009|accessdate=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an essay contest, he went to college and graduated with honors from [[Lincoln University (Missouri)|Lincoln University]] in [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]], the state's undergraduate institution for African Americans, with a [[bachelor's degree]] in history. He made up the difference between the scholarship and the college's tuition by selling magazines on the street.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Garrison |first=Chad |title=The Mystery of Lloyd Gaines |url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/content/printVersion/220398/ |newspaper=[[The Riverfront Times]] |publisher=[[Village Voice Media]] |location=[[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis, MO]] |date=April 4, 2007 |accessdate=March 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305102655/http://www.riverfronttimes.com/content/printVersion/220398/ |archivedate=March 5, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was president of the senior class and a brother in the [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternity]].&lt;ref name="Cold cases"&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Hélèna|title=Cold Cases: Famous Unsolved Mysteries, Crimes, and Disappearances in America|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-37692-4|pages=157–63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FEjw5CFkZvQC&amp;pg=PA157|accessdate=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==

In 1936, he applied for admission to the law school at the [[University of Missouri]], encouraged by [[Lorenzo Greene]], a Lincoln University professor at the time and veteran civil rights activist. Accounts vary as to whether Gaines did this purely on his own initiative or was encouraged by the NAACP simply to have a [[plaintiff]], without any real interest of his own in attending law school.&lt;ref name="Linder essay"&gt;{{cite web|last=Linder|first=Douglas O.|authorlink=Doug Linder|title=Before ''Brown'': Charles H. Houston and the ''Gaines'' Case|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/houstonessay.html|publisher=[[University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Law]]|year=2000|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When St. Louis lawyer Sidney Redmond, one of the three dozen African Americans then admitted to the Missouri bar, informed [[Charles Hamilton Houston]], who was leading the NAACP's legal effort against the segregationist [[Jim Crow laws]], that Gaines was willing to be a plaintiff, Houston at first asked him whether he could find someone else. Houston later yielded when it was apparent Gaines was the only available plaintiff, but never explained what his initial objections might have been.&lt;ref name="Root and Branch"&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Rawn|title=Root And Branch: Charles Hamilton Houston, Thurgood Marshall, And The Struggle to End Segregation|year=2010|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] USA|isbn=978-1-59691-606-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7BLVe6SDTsoC&amp;pg=PA105|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law school's [[Registrar (education)|registrar]], Sy Woodson Canada, had denied Gaines' admission on racial grounds although he was otherwise qualified for admission to the law school. The official policy of the State of Missouri was to pay the "out of state" expenses for education of African Americans who wished to study law until such time as demand was sufficient to build a separate law school within the State of Missouri for them. Gaines and his lawyers argued that lawyers educated out of state lost the benefit of courses that were specific to Missouri law, and the connections and firsthand experience of the state's courts an in-state legal education would offer.&lt;ref name="Main Gaines cite"&gt;''[[Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada]]'', {{ussc|305|337|1938}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaines and his lawyers were not hoping to overturn the "[[Separate but equal|separate but equal]]" standard set out by the Court's 1896 ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' decision allowing legal racial segregation, but to subtly undermine it by holding states that did segregate along racial lines to the "equal" part of the doctrine. They targeted graduate and professional public institutions of higher learning, which, unlike most other segregated facilities, were few in number and under centralized state control. Once segregationist states realized they had a choice between expensive duplication of such institutions for a small group of African Americans and integration of their existing facilities, they would choose the latter and voluntarily integrate.&lt;ref name="Reforming Jim Crow"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Kimberley S.|title=Reforming Jim Crow: Southern Politics and State In The Age Before ''Brown''|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-538742-1|pages=153–54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBR_hLeFde8C&amp;pg=PA153|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houston also believed that since such schools served small portions of the population, attempts to integrate them would arouse less public opposition than efforts to integrate [[elementary education|elementary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] schools would. Lastly, judges had themselves been educated in them and could better understand the impact of inequalities on students.&lt;ref name="Linder essay" /&gt;

They were encouraged by a 1936 case, ''University of Maryland v. Murray'', in which Houston and [[Thurgood Marshall]] had persuaded the [[Maryland Court of Appeals]], that state's highest court, that the [[University of Maryland]] could not meet its constitutional burden of equal treatment by offering to reimburse him for tuition out of state instead of allowing him to attend the university, which as an African American he was barred by the university's administration from doing.&lt;ref name="Murray v. Maryland"&gt;''University of Maryland v. Murray'', 169 Md. 478, 182 A. 590, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; In Missouri Gaines was likely as well to be offered reimbursement for his out-of-state tuition; however, the racial bar to attendance took the form of a state law instead of an administrative regulation. They hoped to get the Supreme Court to hear the case and establish a [[legal precedent|precedent]].&lt;ref name="Before Brown"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavergne|first=Gary M.|title=Before ''Brown'': Heman Marion Sweatt, Thurgood Marshall, And the Long Road to Justice|year=2010|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|location=[[Austin, Texas|Austin, TX]]|isbn=978-0-292-72200-2|pages=41–43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q--b6ExcLUwC&amp;pg=PA41|authorlink=Gary Lavergne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houston, Redmond and Gaines left St. Louis before dawn one summer day that year to drive to [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]] for the trial at [[Boone County, Missouri|Boone County]] [[Boone County Courthouse (Missouri)|courthouse]]. They arrived as the courthouse was beginning to open for the morning. Due to [[1936 North American heat wave|that summer's severe drought]], many of the white farmers in the surrounding communities were there, waiting to make applications for relief. Some went into the courtroom to take in the unusual sight of African American lawyers arguing a case.&lt;ref name="Root and Branch 107–13"&gt;James, 107–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

They were joined by one hundred current University of Missouri law students, reporters, and a few local African Americans. Two recent [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings]] had discouraged most of the local black community from attending, despite efforts to the contrary by the local NAACP chapters. They sat among the whites, since none of the courtroom facilities were segregated. Even the lawyers for both sides shared a table, and shook hands before the case.&lt;ref name="Root and Branch 107–13" /&gt;

By the time trial was to begin, the heat outside had already exceeded {{convert|100|°F|°C}}. The crowds and poor ventilation made it even hotter in the courtroom, and Judge W.M. Dinwiddie suggested that he and the lawyers conduct proceedings with their jackets off. Houston claimed Gaines' exclusion from the law school solely on racial grounds violated his constitutional rights. For the state, William Hogsett conceded that Gaines was an excellent and qualified student with a right to a legal education, as long as it was somewhere other than the law school, since it was [[Public policy doctrine|public policy]] of the state, codified in the constitution and laws enacted by its legislature elected by the people, that African American students not be allowed to attend Missouri law school.&lt;ref name="Root and Branch 107–13" /&gt;

Gaines testified on his own behalf, and various state and university officials for their side. They claimed that admitting African Americans, the only applicants specifically barred regardless of other qualifications, would be "an unhappy thing" for both them and other students. William Masterson, [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the University of Missouri School of Law, claimed not to know details of the admissions process or the school's budget on [[cross-examination]].&lt;ref name="Root and Branch 107–13" /&gt;

Hogsett presented his case for the audience, some of whom nodded in sympathy with his arguments, while Houston concentrated on getting facts in the record for the appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the only venue where he expected and wanted to prevail. He never seriously expected to win at trial, and indeed two weeks later Dinwiddie decided the case for the state. The judge did not write an opinion explaining his holding,&lt;ref name="Root and Branch 107–13" /&gt; and Gaines appealed to the [[Missouri Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="Linder essay" /&gt;

The state's highest court heard the arguments near the end of the year. While normally it sat in two divisions, the case was considered so important that all seven justices were present. Two months later, it upheld Judge Dinwiddie.&lt;ref name="MO SCt cite"&gt;''State ex. rel. Gaines v. Canada'', 113 S.W.2d 783, 342 Mo. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[William Francis Frank]] reiterated the court's earlier holdings for segregation, that it was to the advantage of blacks as well as whites. In Gaines's case, he held that the separate but equal standard was satisfied by the availability of an out-of-state legal education at state expense. "Equality is not identity of privileges," he wrote.&lt;ref name="Linder essay" /&gt;

Houston and Redmond successfully petitioned to the [[United States Supreme Court]] for ''[[certiorari]]''. Now known as [[Missouri Ex Rel Gaines v. Canada|''Gaines v. Canada'']], the case was [[oral argument|argued]] on November 9, 1938. Houston said the state's offer to pay for Gaines to attend law school out of state could not guarantee him a legal education equal to that offered white students.&lt;ref name="Main Gaines cite" /&gt;

A month later a 6-2&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Justice [[Benjamin Cardozo]] had recently died, and his seat had not yet been filled, leaving one vacancy on the Court.&lt;/ref&gt; majority ordered the State of Missouri either to admit Gaines to the University of Missouri School of Law or to provide another school of equal stature within the state borders.&lt;ref name="Main Gaines cite" /&gt; [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Charles Evans Hughes]] wrote for the [[majority opinion|majority]]:
{{quote|The basic consideration is not as to what sort of opportunities other States provide, or whether they are as good as those in Missouri, but as to what opportunities Missouri itself furnishes to white students and denies to negroes solely upon the ground of color. The admissibility of laws separating the races in the enjoyment of privileges afforded by the State rests wholly upon the equality of the privileges which the laws give to the separated groups within the State. The question here is not of a duty of the State to supply legal training, or of the quality of the training which it does supply, but of its duty when it provides such training to furnish it to the residents of the State upon the basis of an equality of right. By the operation of the laws of Missouri a privilege has been created for white law students which is denied to negroes by reason of their race. The white resident is afforded legal education within the State; the negro resident having the same qualifications is refused it there and must go outside the State to obtain it. That is a denial of the equality of legal right to the enjoyment of the privilege which the State has set up, and the provision for the payment of tuition fees in another State does not remove the discrimination.&lt;ref name="Gaines quote cite"&gt;''Gaines''. at 349–50, [[Charles Evans Hughes|Hughes]], C.J.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
The case articulated an important rule of law in the sequence of NAACP cases leading to the eventual desegregation order: that any academic program that a state provided to whites had to have an equivalent available to blacks. The ''Gaines'' holding helped lay the foundation for the landmark 1954 ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', which ordered all public schools desegregated and overturned ''Plessy'' by holding that separate facilities were inherently unequal.&lt;ref name="NYT story" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cold cases" /&gt;

Since the Supreme Court had ordered the Missouri Supreme Court to rehear the case in light of its ruling, Gaines' legal battle was not over. Historian [[Gary Lavergne]] describes Gaines during this period as "[[wikt:high-maintenance|high-maintenance]]". He sought out media attention, then complained about how stressful it was being the center of attention. [[Heman Marion Sweatt]], later the plaintiff in [[Sweatt v. Painter|another desegregation case]] heard by the Supreme Court, worked with Gaines at the [[University of Michigan]], where the NAACP had paid for him to attend graduate school in the meantime, and reportedly found him "rather arrogant."&lt;ref name="Before Brown" /&gt;

After working as a clerk for the [[Works Progress Administration]] in Michigan and completing a [[master's degree]] in economics, Gaines returned to Missouri in anticipation of the proceedings there, set to begin in August. The Missouri legislature hastily passed a bill [[appropriation (law)|appropriating]] $275,000 (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|275000|1939|r=-3}}}} in modern dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}) to convert an old beauty school in St. Louis into the new [[Lincoln University School of Law]], in the hope that would satisfy the court. The NAACP planned to challenge the establishment of the new law school as still inadequate compared to the resources of the existing University of Missouri School of Law. Gaines, who would still need to pay his law school tuition as well as his daily living expenses, looked for work in the meantime. Between the continuing [[Great Depression|Depression]] and segregation, he had to settle for work at a gas station. He gave speeches to local NAACP chapters and church groups for donations, telling them "I am ready, willing and able to enroll in the law department at the University of Missouri in September, and I have the fullest intention of doing so," but still had to borrow money from his brother George for everyday expenses.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

Gaines quit the job at the gas station when he discovered the owner was purposely mislabeling low-[[Octane rating|grade]] fuel as high-grade, fearing he might be caught up in the legal consequences should the fraud be discovered. After taking a train across the state to Kansas City to give a speech to the local NAACP chapter and look, unsuccessfully, for work, he boarded another train for Chicago. There he reunited with the Page family, friends and neighbors from his youth in the Central West End, and stayed at a local [[YMCA]].&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

==Disappearance==

Over the next several weeks, Gaines looked for work and visited with the Pages. While he maintained at public appearances that he was determined to continue his court case until its end and to attend the University of Missouri School of Law, in private he was becoming increasingly ambivalent. His mother said that he had decided not to go, as they both believed it was "too dangerous." Nancy Page later recalled asking Gaines directly about this. "His answer wasn't straightforward, and if I remember correctly, he said something like this: 'If I don't go, I will have at least made it possible for some other boy or girl to go.'"&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

In his last letter to his mother, dated March 3, he expressed similar sentiments:
{{quote|As for my publicity relative to the university case, I have found that my race still likes to applaud, shake hands, pat me on the back and say how great and noble is the idea: how historical and socially important the case but — and it ends ... Off and out of the confines of the publicity columns, I am just a man — not one who has fought and sacrificed to make the case possible: one who is still fighting and sacrificing — almost the 'supreme sacrifice' to see that it is a complete and lasting success for thirteen million Negroes — no! — just another man. Sometimes I wish I were just a plain, ordinary man whose name no one recognized.}}
Gaines had begun the letter by telling her that he had come to Chicago "hoping to find it possible to make my own way" and ended it, "Should I forget to write for a time, don't worry about it. I can look after myself OK".&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

Gaines also wrote that his accommodations at the YMCA were paid through March 7 and if he stayed in Chicago beyond that date, he would have to make "other arrangements." After that, brothers at an Alpha Phi Alpha house took him in. He continued to have dinner at the Pages' home.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

Nancy Page said that Gaines had told her he'd taken a job at a department store. A reporter later found that although he had been hired, he never reported for what would have been his first day of work. In the last days that she had contact with Gaines, Page said he seemed "to be running away from something." Gaines's family members and descendants believe he -and possibly the family as a whole- had received death threats, and given their background in rural Mississippi, they would have been too fearful to report the threats to the police.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

Gaines's financial woes continued so the Alpha Phi Alpha brothers took up a collection for him. Gaines promised the Pages that he would repay their generosity by taking them out to dinner on the night of March 19 but he never got the chance to do so. Earlier that evening, Gaines told the house attendant that he was going out to buy stamps although the weather was cold and wet. Gaines never returned and no one ever reported seeing him again. His ultimate fate remains unknown.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

==Aftermath==

Gaines left behind a [[duffel bag]] filled with dirty clothing at the fraternity house when he disappeared. Since he had had a history of leaving for days at a time with little or no notice to his friends and family, and often kept to himself, his absence seemed unremarkable at first. No report was made to the police in either Chicago or St. Louis.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

His disappearance finally became an issue several months later. In August, Houston and Sidney Redmond went looking for him as they began to argue his case at the Missouri Supreme Court's rehearing. They could not locate him, and Redmond recalled that the Gaines family was neither concerned nor very helpful in trying to do so. The Lincoln University School of Law in St. Louis opened in late September to pickets denouncing it as a segregationist sham.&lt;ref name="Root and Branch 121"&gt;James, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; While 30 students who had been admitted since it was created showed up, Gaines was not among them. Since only Gaines had been denied admission to the University of Missouri School of Law, only he had [[standing (law)|standing]] to pursue the case before the Supreme Court of Missouri, and the case could not proceed without him.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

Near the end of the year the NAACP began a frantic effort to find him. There were rumors that he had been killed or committed suicide, along with rumors that he had been paid off to disappear and was either living in [[Mexico City]] or teaching school in New York.&lt;ref name="Root and Branch" /&gt; The story received widespread media attention, and his picture was published in newspapers across the country with a plea for anyone with information to contact the NAACP. No credible leads were received. In his 1948 memoirs, NAACP president [[Walter Francis White|Walter White]] said, "He has been variously reported in Mexico, apparently supplied with ample funds, and in other parts of North America."&lt;ref name="Walter White book"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Walter|title=A Man Called White: The Autobiography of Walter White|year=1948|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|location=[[Athens, Georgia|Athens, GA]]|isbn=978-0-8203-1698-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E941yjPRAQEC&amp;pg=PA162|authorlink=Walter Francis White|accessdate=March 11, 2012|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary Lavergne notes that Houston, Marshall and Redmond never publicly called for an investigation of the disappearance or stated that they believed Gaines had met with foul play. Since extrajudicial abductions and murders of African Americans who challenged segregation were not unheard of at the time, and the three lawyers frequently spoke out and demanded investigations when they believed they had occurred, he thinks that they had no such evidence and believed that the erratic Gaines, whom they knew to have grown resentful of the NAACP and his role in the lawsuit, had purposely dropped out of sight.&lt;ref name="Before Brown" /&gt; Fifty years later, near the end of his own career as a Supreme Court justice, Marshall recalled the case in terms that suggest this assessment: "The sonofabitch just never contacted us again."&lt;ref name="Up Close"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowe|first=Chris|title=Thurgood Marshall: Up Close|year=2008|publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]]|isbn=978-0-670-06228-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8zt7A9HHAUC&amp;pg=PT55|page=55|accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1940, the state of Missouri moved to dismiss the case due to the absence of the plaintiff. Houston and Redmond did not oppose the motion, and it was granted.&lt;ref name="Cold cases" /&gt;

==Investigations==

No law enforcement agency of the era formally investigated Gaines's disappearance. It had not been reported to any of them, and many African Americans distrusted the police. [[J. Edgar Hoover]], director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), who took a very suspicious view of the civil rights movement, wrote in an internal memo in 1940 that he did not believe the case fell under the FBI's jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="NYT story" /&gt;

With the onset of [[World War II]], other concerns displaced the Gaines case for most of the 1940s. The only other official record relating to the case released by the FBI was a 1970 letter from Hoover to an unidentified member of the public, thanking them for their interest in the case but reiterating his position from 30 years earlier that he did not believe the FBI had any jurisdiction to investigate.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt; Two media outlets looked into the case a half-century apart, ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' in the 1950s and ''[[The Riverfront Times]]'' in the 2000s.

===''Ebony''===

''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' reporter Edward T. Clayton revisited Gaines and his disappearance in 1951. It has been described as the most thorough investigation of the case. Clayton retraced Gaines's movements in the months between the Supreme Court ruling and his trip to Chicago. Many who knew Gaines were still alive, such as his family in St. Louis and fraternity brothers in Chicago, and he interviewed them.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

He found little new information, but was able to draw a fuller portrait of Gaines that revealed the young man's disillusionment with his activist path. Callie Gaines, bedridden in her attic, shared her last conversation with him in which both of them realized that he wouldn't actually be following through and enrolling in the University of Missouri School of Law. She said that he had sent her a final postcard saying, "Goodbye. If you don't hear from me anymore you know I'll be all right." She had heard all the rumors about him turning up in Mexico or New York. "But nobody knows any more than we do."&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt; One of his sisters believed he was still alive.&lt;ref name="Vox story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zapp|first=M.|title=Who was Lloyd Gaines?|url=http://www.voxmagazine.com/stories/2006/12/21/who-was-lloyd-gaines/|newspaper=''Vox''|publisher=''[[Columbia Missourian]]''|location=[[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia, MO]]|date=December 21, 2006|accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family has never sought to have him [[Declared death in absentia|declared legally dead]].&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

Gaines's brother George, who had kept loaning Lloyd spending money at that time, said that at the time of his disappearance Lloyd had owed him $500. He was particularly bitter about the NAACP for, in his opinion, exploiting Lloyd. "That organization—the N-A-A-C-P or whatever it was—had him going around here making speeches," Gaines told Clayton, "but when he got ready to go to Kansas City, I had to let him have $10 so he could get himself a white shirt." Sidney Redmond agreed that the Gaines family "doesn't seem too much concerned—and never was as I recall" about finding him due to their resentment of the civil rights' organization's role in pushing Lloyd Gaines into the public eye without adequately providing for or protecting him.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

George Gaines did, however, provide Clayton with Gaines's letters home, including the last one, almost two weeks before he disappeared. In it, Gaines again laments the insufficient support he received from his fellow African Americans and wishes he were just a regular, unknown person again. It, like the postcard, concludes with a suggestion that he may be out of touch for a while.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt; All of them have since been digitized and are currently online at the University of Missouri's digital archives.

In Chicago, Clayton talked to the Alpha Phi Alpha brothers among whom Gaines had spent his last known days and the Pages, his family friends from St. Louis. The former could offer little beyond pinning down the precise date of his disappearance and the duffel bag of dirty laundry he left behind.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt; Two who claimed Gaines had sent them postcards from Mexico were unable to corroborate their accounts with the actual postcards.&lt;ref name="Vox story" /&gt;

The Pages shared the details of Gaines's increasingly anxious state of mind in March 1939. Nancy Page did not inquire closely, out of respect for his privacy, but could tell something was bothering him. She reported a conversation with Gaines in which he was at best ambivalent about continuing the legal case and attending the University of Missouri School of Law. From her Clayton found out about the job Gaines had accepted, and found through his own research that Gaines had never actually started work there.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

===''The Riverfront Times''===

St Louis' alternative weekly newspaper, ''[[The Riverfront Times]]'', revisited the case in 2007, well over 60 years after his disappearance. By that time Gaines had received honors (some described as posthumous) and the FBI had accepted the case as the oldest of nearly one hundred civil-rights era disappearances referred to it by the NAACP. His immediate family and all others who had worked or socialized with him during that time were dead. Reporter Chad Garrison spoke with George Gaines, a nephew of Lloyd's who was one of only two surviving family members who had been alive when Lloyd disappeared, although he had only been an infant at the time, and other, younger descendants.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

George Gaines said his family had rarely spoken of Lloyd during his childhood in the 1940s, but when they did it was usually in highly positive terms. "Lloyd was always held in high regard as a person who set a positive example and stood up for what was right", he recalled. He had assumed that his uncle had died, and only when he read the ''Ebony'' article did he learn that Lloyd's true fate was unknown.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

While Garrison mostly reiterated Clayton's reporting, finding no new facts about the disappearance itself or Gaines's time in Chicago, he found more direct evidence that Gaines might indeed have fled to Mexico and lived out his life there. Sid Reedy, a [[University City, Missouri|University City]] librarian who had been an Alpha Phi Alpha brother at Lincoln University as well, told Garrison that after becoming fascinated by the case in the late 1970s, he had sought out [[Lorenzo Greene]], Gaines's mentor at Lincoln University and an esteemed civil rights activist and intellectual. Greene told Reedy that while on a visit to [[Mexico City]] in the late 1940s he had made contact with Lloyd Gaines.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

Greene, who died in 1988, claimed to have spoken on the telephone with Gaines, whose voice he recognized instantly, several times. The two made plans to have dinner together, but Gaines did not show up. Greene told Reedy that Gaines had indeed "grown tired of the fight ... He had some business in Mexico City and apparently did well financially."&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

Garrison reported that Greene's son, Lorenzo Thomas Greene, said his father had also told him of the encounter. He said the older man always hoped Gaines would return. But because of his experience with the FBI while active in the civil-rights movement during those years, he did not report it. "There wasn't a lot of trust there," said the son. "Even if my father went to them with that information, I really don't think they would have cared."&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

Some of Gaines's relatives were willing to accept that he lived out his life in Mexico, as opposed to the alternative scenarios. "It's better than being buried in a basement somewhere—[[Jimmy Hoffa]] style," said Paulette Mosby-Smith, one of Gaines's great-nieces. Others believe that would have been against his nature. "It's hard for me to believe that he went to Mexico and accepted a big payoff," George Gaines told Garrison. "That's not the same man who presented himself during the trial. I don't believe he would compromise his integrity like that." Another great-niece, Tracy Berry, who went to law school herself and became a federal prosecutor, agrees:
{{quote|When you think of those old photos of [[lynching in the United States|lynchings]] and burned bodies, who wouldn't want to think that he lived a full life in Mexico? But based on the love my grandmother and great-grandmother had for their brother and son, that's really hard for me to reconcile. If he wanted to walk away, there are easier ways to do it than to sever ties from the entire family."&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;}}
She has since told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that she believes her great-uncle was murdered.&lt;ref name="NYT story" /&gt;

==Legacy and honors==

Although they had never had Lloyd Gaines declared legally dead, the family nevertheless erected a monument to him in a Missouri cemetery in 1999.&lt;ref name="Vox story" /&gt; "His legacy didn't so much make me want to go to law school," says Tracy Berry. "But I think he did instill the legacy of education in our family. It's expected that you go to college. He started the fight that made it all possible."&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt; The ''[[Louisville Defender]]'', that city's African American newspaper, expressed similar sentiments in a December 1939 [[editorial]]: "[W]hether Gaines has been bribed, intimidated or worse, should certainly have little permanent effect on the struggle for equal rights and social justice in connection with Negro education in the [[Southern United States|South]] ... [where] Negroes are already hammering upon the doors of graduate schools hitherto closed to them, with increasing persistence."&lt;ref name="December 1939 The Crisis"&gt;{{cite news|title=From the Press of the Nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA371|newspaper=[[The Crisis]]|publisher=[[NAACP]]|page=372|date=December 1939|accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I remember the ''Gaines'' case as one of our greatest legal victories," said [[Thurgood Marshall]], who argued ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' before the Supreme Court and was later that body's first African American justice. "But I have never lost the pain of having so many people spend so much time and money on him, just to have him disappear."&lt;ref name="Up Close" /&gt;

Even without having forced the issue at the Missouri Supreme Court, and without challenging the [[separate but equal]] doctrine, ''Gaines'' "[made] constitutional compliance in the absence of [[racial integration|integration]] difficult to achieve," according to historian [[Gary Lavergne]]. He cited three aspects of the decision:

*First, the Court held that Gaines's right was "a personal and individual one." Gaines was entitled to go to law school regardless of how little demand there was for legal education among African Americans.
*Second, the state could not meet its constitutional burden by sending students out of state. "With ''Gaines'', the idea of using out-of-state scholarships to meet the test of separate but equal legally ended forever and everywhere in the United States," Lavergne says.
*Third, "the Court said that the promise of future equality ... did not make temporary discrimination constitutional."
NAACP lawyer [[Charles Hamilton Houston]] had hoped that the effect of similar court rulings that gave segregationist states a choice between full integration or duplication of programs for students of different races would lead many of them to choose the less expensive former option. But without Gaines, he could not carry through the next stage of his plan in the Missouri Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Before Brown" /&gt;

In the short term the abrupt dismissal of the case forced by Gaines's disappearance was a setback for all efforts to legally challenge segregation. The NAACP's resources were depleted after having spent $25,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1940|r=-3}}}} in modern dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}) on the case. New plaintiffs, already difficult to find in the depressed economy, couldn't be supported by the organization. Lincoln University School of Law, the only tangible result of the case, was closed by the mid-1950s due to lack of students. When [[World War II]], which had already begun in Europe, swept in the United States two years later, the civil-rights struggle was suspended for the duration.

Houston, ill with the [[tuberculosis]] that would end his life a decade later, resigned from the NAACP to return to private practice. Marshall took over for him, a change of personnel that ultimately benefited the desegregation legal effort after the war, when the organization found more plaintiffs and challenged segregationist policies in public graduate schools with cases like ''[[Sipuel v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla.]]'',&lt;ref name="Sipuel case"&gt;''[[Sipuel v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla.]]'', {{ussc|332|631|1948}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sweatt v. Painter]]''&lt;ref name="Sweatt case"&gt;''[[Sweatt v. Painter]]'', {{ussc|339|629|1950}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents]]''.&lt;ref name="McLaurin case"&gt;''[[McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents]]'', {{ussc|339|637|1950}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Missouri School of Law, bowing to pressure from the student body, finally admitted its first African American student in 1951. Three years later the desegregation effort climaxed with ''Brown'', overturning ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' and the separate but equal doctrine forever.&lt;ref name="Up Close" /&gt;

===At University of Missouri===

In the years after ''Brown'', when desegregation became a reality but tensions over it persisted, Gaines's story became a cautionary tale at the University of Missouri. In a 2004 paper, LeeAnn Whites, a professor of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] history at the school, repeated a version of it in which Gaines had been on his way to enroll at the school as an undergraduate and had disappeared from a train traveling across the state, with the implication that he was murdered.&lt;ref name="LeeAnn Whites essay"&gt;{{cite book|last=Whites|first=LeeAnn|editor-first=Joan|editor-last=Waugh|title=The Memory of the Civil War in American Culture|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|location=[[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill, NC]]|year=2004|chapter=You Can't Change History by Moving A Rock: Gender, Race and the Cultural Politics of Confederate Memorialization|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-YxaltOdSEC&amp;pg=PA225|pages=213–235 [225]|isbn=978-0-8078-5572-0|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerald M. Boyd]], a St. Louis native and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning reporter for the ''New York Times'' who was one of a few hundred black students at the University of Missouri in the early 1970s, recalls hearing Gaines's story early in his time there, when he was confronted by open displays of racial prejudice such as the university's "Confederate Rock". "Whatever his fate", he wrote in his memoirs, "in the eyes of blacks, the university bore the brunt of the blame."&lt;ref name="Gerald Boyd memoirs"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyd|first=Gerald M.|title=My Times in Black and White: Race and Power at ''The New York Times''|year=2010|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1-55652-952-8|pages=63–64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1trDR8H9bQC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The University of Missouri, and particularly the University of Missouri School of Law, began recognizing Gaines near the end of the 20th century, despite his never having been formally admitted as a student. It began with a [[scholarship]] in his name in 1995. In 2001, the school's African American center was named for Gaines and another early African American who challenged the school's color bar in court. A portrait of Gaines also hangs in a prominent public place in the law school building.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

Those honors were supplemented in 2006 when the law school awarded him an [[honorary degree]] in Law. The Supreme Court of Missouri, which had denied Gaines's admission almost 70 years before, and the state bar association granted him an honorary posthumous law license. It has been suggested that if Gaines were still alive (he would have turned 95 in 2006) and reappeared, those awards would allow him to practice law in the State of Missouri.&lt;ref name="Riverfront Times story" /&gt;

'''Aimee Françoise M'Pongo Langu''' (27 August 1956 – 15 January 1990), known professionally as '''M'Pongo Love''', was a Congolese singer and songwriter. First taking up singing in a church choir, she quit her job when she was 19 years old to pursue a career as a vocalist. Beginning with support from other established musicians, M'Pongo eventually began writing her own compositions, often utilising feminist themes.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Aimee Françoise M'Pongo Langu was born on 27 August 1956 in [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]], [[Belgian Congo]], the second daughter in a family of seven children.{{sfn|Afrique élite|1989|p=89}} Her father, [[Gilbert Pongo]], was a soldier,&lt;ref name= planete/&gt; while her mother was the director of a girls' education center. At the age of four M'Pongo contracted [[polio]] and was paralysed by a shot of [[penicillin]]. She crawled until she was trained to use a prosthesis{{sfn|Tenaille|2002|p=134}} in 1962, allowing her to walk.&lt;ref name= planete&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.congoplanete.com/article.jsp?id=45262550| title = Mpongo Love : une voix partie à fleur d'âge| date = 14 January 2010| website = Congo Planéte| access-date = 29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, M'Pongo attended a church where her father was a [[Cantor (Christianity)|cantor]] and began singing for the choir.{{sfn|Afrique élite|1989|p=89}}

M'Pongo also sang in her secondary school choir and, when she graduated, she moved to Kinshasa and enrolled in a shorthand typing course.{{sfn|Stewart|2003|p=220}} Afterwards she took a job as an executive secretary at a firm.&lt;ref name= planete/&gt; When she wasn't working she looked for show-business contracts, introducing herself as M'Pongo Love, a name her parents had reportedly used for her since her childhood.{{sfn|Stewart|2003|p=220}}

=== Musical career ===
In December 1975 when she was 19 years of age, M'Pongo met saxophonist [[Empompo Loway]], who resolved to help her develop a singing career{{sfn|Stewart|2003|pp=220–221}} and persuaded her to leave her secretary job.&lt;ref name= planete/&gt; After an initial failure to secure M'Pongo [[patronage]], the two met band manager Ngwango Isionoma, who agreed to supply them with money to start her career.{{sfn|Stewart|2003|p=221}}

Loway assisted her in forming a band, Tcheke Tcheke Love, and composed her first songs. M'Pongo debuted with the song "Pas possible Maty" and soon thereafter delivered her first concert at the Ciné Palladium in [[Kinshasa]]. Throughout 1977 she performed with an additional backing group, Les Ya tupa’s (with members such as [[Ray Lema]], [[Félix Manuaku Waku]], and [[Alfred Nzimbi]]), singing compositions by [[Mayaula Mayoni]], [[Simaro Lutumba]], and [[Souzy Kaseya]]. Her rendition of Mayaula's "Ndaya" became a hit success in Kinshasa, especially among local women.&lt;ref name= planete/&gt;

M'Pongo soon began composing and arranging her own music. In 1980 she ended her professional relationship with Empompo to work independently,&lt;ref name= planete/&gt; subsequently moving to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Passings: M'Pongo Love 1956-1990| newspaper = The Beat| volume = 9| issue = 2| pages = 51–52| location = Los Angeles| date = 1990| url = https://search.proquest.com/docview/897369972?pq-origsite=summon}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later produced music under her own label, "Love’s Music".&lt;ref name= planete/&gt; Later in life she contracted cerebral [[meningitis]] in Gabon.&lt;ref name= planete/&gt; She was at her home in Binza, Kinshasa, planning to make a career comeback when her condition worsened and in December 1989 she was admitted to a local clinic. Her older brother told the media that she had suffered a "strong attack", not specifying her illness.{{sfn|Stewart|2003|pp=369–370}} She died on 15 January 1990 and was survived by three daughters.&lt;ref name= planete/&gt;

== Style and themes ==
M'Pongo sang in a clear, slightly nasal voice and utilised precise intonations.&lt;ref name= planete/&gt; During her performances she braced herself on the sides of the stage to compensate for her physical disability.{{sfn|Tenaille|2002|p=134}} Compared to her contemporaries, M'Pongo was the most feminist of all women soukous singers and actively criticised polygamy and the practice of keeping [[Mistress (lover)|mistresses]] in her music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.telerama.fr/musique/la-rumba-malgre-tout,49826.php| title = Au Congo, la rumba malgré tout| last = Azoulay| first = Eliane| date = 27 November 2009| language = French| publisher = ''[[Télérama]]''| access-date = 29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1989 interview she explained her feminist views:{{sfn|Tenaille|2002|p=134}}&lt;blockquote&gt;I sing about women's problems, I try to give them courage...and I will stop singing when the relations between men and women in Africa become problem free. But what African man doesn't have a mistress? In addition to a hard life, women have a lot to endure. I have a feminist duty to see they fight, that they defend themselves, that they hold their heads high, that they take independent women as examples...We must know how to say what we are, we African women, without fearing all the modernism we need to assimilate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Peiter C. Zatko''', better known as '''Mudge''', is a network security expert, [[Open-source software|open source]] programmer, writer, and a [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]]. He was the most prominent member of the high-profile [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] [[think tank]] the [[L0pht]]&lt;ref name="one"&gt;[http://attrition.org/errata/www/ao.016.html Security Scene Errata] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050502171648/http://attrition.org/errata/www/ao.016.html |date=2 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{deadlink|date=December 2017}} as well as the long-lived computer and culture hacking cooperative the [[Cult of the Dead Cow]].

While involved with the [[L0pht]], Mudge contributed significantly to disclosure and education on information and security vulnerabilities. In addition to pioneering [[buffer overflow]] work, the security advisories he released contained early examples of flaws in the following areas: [[code injection]], [[race condition]], [[side-channel attack]], exploitation of embedded systems, and [[cryptanalysis]] of commercial systems. He was the original author of the [[password cracking]] software [[L0phtCrack]].&lt;ref name="LC"&gt;[http://www.l0phtcrack.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304124849/http://www.l0phtcrack.com/ |date=4 March 2012 }} L0phtCrack]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Mudge accepted a position as a program manager at [[DARPA]] where he oversaw cyber security research.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10450552-245.html|title=Hacker 'Mudge' gets DARPA job|date=10 February 2010|publisher=|access-date=12 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109160231/http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10450552-245.html|archive-date=9 January 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Mudge went to work for Google in their Advanced Technology &amp; Projects division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mocana.com/blog/2013/04/17/peiter-mudge-zatko-to-join-motorola-mobilitys-advanced-technology-projects-atap/|title=Peiter “Mudge” Zatko To Join Motorola Mobility’s Advanced Technology &amp; Projects (ATAP)|publisher=|access-date=9 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205100738/https://mocana.com/blog/2013/04/17/peiter-mudge-zatko-to-join-motorola-mobilitys-advanced-technology-projects-atap/|archive-date=5 December 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=startgoogle/&gt;

==Biography==
Born in December 1970, Mudge graduated from the [[Berklee College of Music]] at the top of his class&lt;ref name="berklee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berklee.edu/bt/192/other_paths.html|title=Other Paths - Berklee College of Music|website=www.berklee.edu|access-date=1 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010111509/http://www.berklee.edu/bt/192/other_paths.html|archive-date=10 October 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an adept [[guitar]] player.

Mudge was responsible for early research into a type of security [[vulnerability]] known as the [[buffer overflow]]. In 1995 he published "How to Write Buffer Overflows", one of the first papers on the topic.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insecure.org/stf/mudge_buffer_overflow_tutorial.html|title=L0pht Heavy Industries Services|website=insecure.org|access-date=24 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903180512/http://insecure.org/stf/mudge_buffer_overflow_tutorial.html|archive-date=3 September 2006|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published some of the first security advisories and research demonstrating early vulnerabilities in Unix such as code injection, side-channel attacks, and information leaks, and was a leader in the [[Full disclosure (computer security)|full disclosure movement]]. He was the initial author of security tools [[L0phtCrack]], AntiSniff, and l0phtwatch.

Mudge was one of the first people from the hacker community to reach out and build relationships with government and industry. In demand as a public speaker, he spoke at hacker conferences such as [[DEF CON]]&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-5/defcon-5.html|title=DEF CON V Archives|website=www.defcon.org|access-date=18 April 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614081151/http://defcon.org/html/defcon-5/defcon-5.html|archive-date=14 June 2006|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and academic conferences such as [[USENIX]].&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2000-4/features/mudge.html|title=USENIX - The Advanced Computing Systems Association|website=www.usenix.org|access-date=18 April 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924030100/http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2000-4/features/mudge.html|archive-date=24 September 2006|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mudge has also been a member of Cult of the Dead Cow since 1996.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cms/team_bios.php3|title=CULT OF THE DEAD COW: CULT OF THE DEAD COW|website=www.cultdeadcow.com|access-date=18 April 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060417125932/http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cms/team_bios.php3|archive-date=17 April 2006|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DARPA==
At DARPA he created the Cyber Analytical Framework the agency used to evaluate DoD investments in offensive and defensive cyber security. During his tenure he ran at least three DoD programs known as Military Networking Protocol (MNP), [[Cyber Insider Threat|Cyber-Insider Threat]] (CINDER), and [[Cyber Fast Track]] (CFT).

Military Networking Protocol (MNP) provided network prioritization with full user-level attribution for military computer networks.&lt;ref name=darpa_mnp/&gt;

Cyber-Insider Threat (CINDER) focused on identifying cyber espionage conducted by virtual insider threats such as future variants of [[Stuxnet]] or [[Duqu]]. CINDER is often mistakenly associated with [[WikiLeaks]] in the media.&lt;ref name=ackerman1/&gt;&lt;ref name=greenberg1/&gt; This is possibly due to the confusion between DARPA programs focused on identifying human insider threat such as ADAMS &lt;ref name=darpa_adams/&gt; and the identification of software espionage posed by malware in the CINDER program.&lt;ref name=darpa_cinder/&gt; This issue was clarified by Mudge in his Defcon 2011 keynote at 46 minutes and 11 seconds into the talk.&lt;ref name=defcon_2011_keynote/&gt;

[[Cyber Fast Track]] (CFT) provided resources and funding to security research, including programs run by [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]], [[hackerspaces]], and [[makerlabs]]. The program provided an alternative to traditional government contracting vehicles that was accessible to individuals and small companies previously unable to work within the cumbersome and complicated [[DARPA]] process. The novel contracting effort had an averaging time of 7 days from receipt of proposal to funding being provided to the proposing research organization.&lt;ref name=dawn_lim1/&gt; The program was initially announced at [[ShmooCon|Shmoocon]] during his 2011 keynote.

'''Philippe-Antoine Grouvelle''' (27 February 1758, Paris – 30 September 1806, [[Varennes-Jarcy|Varennes]], [[Essonne]]) was an 18th-century French [[man of letters]] and journalist.

== Biography ==
The son of a goldsmith, Grouvelle was placed with a notary, who, seeing him busier making verses than acts, dismissed him. [[Nicolas Chamfort|Chamfort]] then took him as secretary, and when he left the job of secretary to the [[Prince of Condé]], Chamfort arranged for Grouvelle to take his place.

Grouvelle was successful in [[Versailles]] where the Queen had his little opera ''Prunes'' performed which he had written with [[Desprez (actor)|Desprez]]. 20 June 1788, he had a comedy entitled ''l’Épreuve délicate'' presented at the [[Comédie-Française|Théâtre-Français]] but it had one performance only and was not published.

When the [[French Revolution]] broke out, Grouvelle adopted its principles, was a founder of the [[Society of 1789]] and published a policy brochure dated from the very [[Palais Bourbon]]. Therefore, he could no longer remain in service to the Prince. After he left him, he engaged into an association with Chamfort, [[Giuseppe Cerutti|Joseph-Antoine Cerutti]] and [[Jean-Paul Rabaut de Saint-Étienne|Rabaut de Saint-Étienne]] in order to publish ''{{Interlanguage link multi|la Feuille villageoise|fr}}''.

After he became Secretary of the Provisional Executive Council in August 1792, he had to bring to [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] at the [[Prison du Temple]] the sentence condemning him to death. [[Jean-Baptiste Clery]], in his memoirs, said that "Grouvelle read off with a low, trembling voice, and he came out of prison in a marked agitation".

In May 1793, Grouvelle was sent to Denmark as Minister of France, and performed his functions until 1800. He was then called to the {{Interlanguage link multi|Corps législatif (Consulat et Premier Empire)|fr|3=Corps législatif (Consulat et Premier Empire)|lt=Corps législatif}}, where he served until September 1802.
&lt;!--
Il avait été nommé, en 1796, associé de l’[[Institut de France]], détail devenu en 1803 correspondant de la troisième classe (histoire et littérature ancienne). S’étant présenté pour une place de membre titulaire, des attaques violentes, dirigées contre lui dans les journaux, à raison des fonctions qu’il avait remplies en 1793, l’affectèrent si vivement qu’elles causèrent sa mort.--&gt;

'''Pretty Nose''' ({{circa|1851}} – after 1952) was an [[Arapaho]] war chief who participated in the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]].&lt;ref name="aljaz"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://projects.aljazeera.com/2014/native-veterans/soldier-wolf/|title=The Story of Soldier Wolf|author=Tristan Ahtone|publisher=[[Al Jazeera America]]| date=September 28, 2014| accessdate =July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some sources, Pretty Nose is called [[Cheyenne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/collection/data/742267632|title=Pretty Nose, Cheyenne Girl, Fort Keogh.

A photograph taken by [[Laton Alton Huffman]] circa 1880 shows Pretty Nose with a young woman named Spotted Fawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/WC064/c4928|title="Spotted Fawn" &amp; "Pretty Nose," Cheyenne |work=Princeton University Library |accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One source from the Montana Memory Project implies that they were sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm15018.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p267301coll3/id/3371/rec/18 |title=Cheyenne Girls.

Pretty Nose's grandson, [[Mark Soldier Wolf]], became an [[Arapaho]] tribal elder who served in the [[US Marine Corps]] during the [[Korean War]]. She witnessed his return to the [[Wind River Indian Reservation]] in 1952, at the age of 101.&lt;ref name="aljaz"/&gt;

'''Sanjiv Bhatt''' is a former [[Indian Police Service]] officer from [[Gujarat]]. He is known for his role in filing an affidavit in the [[Supreme Court of India]] against the [[Chief Minister]] of the [[Government of Gujarat]], [[Narendra Modi]], concerning Modi's alleged role in the [[2002 Gujarat riots]]. He falsely claimed to have attended a meeting, during which Modi allegedly asked top police officials to let Hindus vent out their anger against the Muslims. However, the Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India concluded that Bhatt did not attend this meeting, and dismissed his allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-04-29/news/38904835_1_sanjiv-bhatt-sanjeev-bhatt-zakia-jafri |title=Sanjiv Bhatt did not attend Narendra Modi's Feb 2002 meeting, says SIT |newspaper=Economic Times |date=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Bhatt was removed from the police service, on the ground of "unauthorised absence". In October 2015, the Supreme Court quashed Bhatt's plea for constituting a special investigation team (SIT) for cases filed against him by Gujarat Government. The court lifted a stay on his trial in these cases and asked him to face prosecution. The court observed that, "Bhatt was in active touch with leaders of rival political party, was being tutored by NGOs, was involved in politics and activism of creating pressure, even upon 3-judge bench of this court, amicus and many others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Supreme Court quashes Sanjiv Bhatt’s plea, says attempt to influence court through politics and activism|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/2002-gujarat-riots-sc-dismisses-ex-ips-officer-sanjiv-bhatts-petition-against-amit-shah/|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Sanjiv Bhatt is a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=VE9JQS8yMDEyLzA1LzA5I0FyMDAxMDA%3D|location=Ahmedabad|title=Sanjiv Bhatt the pivot in case against Modi|date=2012-05-09|publisher=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned an M. Tech. degree from the [[Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay]] in 1985. He is married to Shweta Bhatt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/bhatt-is-not-new-to-communal-controversies-courts-99922.html |title=Bhatt is not new to communal controversies, courts |publisher=Firstpost |date=5 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Police career ==

Bhatt joined the Indian Police Service (IPS) in 1988, and was allotted the Gujarat cadre. In 1990, as the [[Additional Superintendent of Police]], he detained 150 people in order to control a riot in [[Jamnagar district]]. Prabhudas Vaishnani, one of the detainees, died of [[kidney failure]] a few days later, after being hospitalised. His brother lodged an FIR against Bhatt and six other policemen, alleging that he had been tortured in police custody.&lt;ref name="IE_Leena_2011"/&gt; Another man, Vijaysinh Bhatti, alleged that he had been beaten up by Bhatt.&lt;ref name="TH_torture_2012" /&gt;

In 1996, as the [[Superintendent of police (India)|Superintendent of Police]] (SP) of [[Banaskantha district]], he was accused of falsely framing a Rajasthan-based lawyer in a narcotics case.&lt;ref name="ToI_curious_2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/The-curious-case-of-Sanjiv-Bhatt/articleshow/8069656.cms |title=The curious case of Sanjiv Bhatt |newspaper=The Times of India |date=24 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/Rajasthan-lawyers-accuse-Guj-top-cop-of-conspiracy/articleshow/8094748.cms Rajasthan lawyers accuse Guj top cop of conspiracy]&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that Bhatt maliciously filed nearly 40 petitions in the high courts of Rajasthan and Gujarat as well as before the apex court to delay action against him. &lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/Rajasthan-lawyers-accuse-Guj-top-cop-of-conspiracy/articleshow/8094748.cms&lt;/ref&gt; The Bar association members have alleged that Bhatt got himself appointed the Gujarat government's officer in-charge for the special appeal petition pending in the SC. They pointed out that Bhatt is using the Gujarat government as a shield to save himself but is also misusing the public money to fight the crimes he committed.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/Rajasthan-lawyers-accuse-Guj-top-cop-of-conspiracy/articleshow/8094748.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

He was accused in another custodial torture case in 1998.&lt;ref name="TH_torture_2012"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article3342659.ece |title=Another case of custodial torture registered against Sanjiv Bhatt |publisher=The Hindu |date=22 April 2012 |accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2002 transfer ===

From December 1999 to September 2002, he worked as Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence in the [[State Intelligence Bureau]] at [[Gandhinagar]]. He was responsible for looking after the state's internal security, border and coastal security, and security of vital installations. He was also responsible for the Chief Minister Narendra Modi's security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/india/sanjiv-bhatt-the-man-who-took-on-narendra-modi-366957.html |title=Sanjiv Bhatt: the man who took on Narendra Modi |date=22 April 2011 |newspaper=IBN Live }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the [[Godhra train burning]] and the subsequent [[2002 Gujarat riots|Hindu-Muslim riots]] led to over a thousand deaths in February-March 2002.

On 9 September 2002, Narendra Modi allegedly mocked the high [[Muslim population growth|Muslim birth rates]] during a speech at [[Bahucharaji]]. Though Modi denied making such remarks, the [[National Commission for Minorities]] (NCM) sought a report from the State Government.&lt;ref name="rediff_2002_speech"/&gt; Modi's Principal Secretary P K Mishra told ''The Indian Express'' that the State Government had no recordings or transcripts of the speech, and therefore, could not send these to the NCM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/should-we-run-relief-camps-open-child-producing-centres/217398 |title='Should We Run Relief Camps? Open Child Producing Centres?' |date=30 September 2002 |publisher=Outlook }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the State Intelligence Bureau provided the NCM a copy of Modi's speech, which had been recorded as part of routine procedure. Subsequently, the Modi government transferred the Bureau's senior officials on 'punishment postings'. The officers transferred included Sanjiv Bhatt, [[R. B. Sreekumar]] and E. Radhakrishnan. Bhatt was posted as principal of the State Reserve Police Training College.&lt;ref name="rediff_2002_speech"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2002/sep/18guj2.htm |title=Gujarat IB officers transferred for putting Modi's controversial speech on record |publisher=rediff.com |date=18 September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sabarmati Jail ===

In 2003, Bhatt was posted as the superintendent of Sabarmati central jail. There, he became very popular among the prisoners. He introduced desserts like [[gajar ka halwa]] on the jail menu. He also posted undertrials in [[Godhra train burning]] case on a jail committee. Two months after his appointment, he was transferred for being too friendly with the prisoners and bestowing favours upon them. On 18 November 2003, nearly half of the 4000 prisoners went on a hunger strike to protest his transfer. Six convicts slashed their wrists in protest.&lt;ref name="IE_Leena_2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/the-man-who-took-on-modi/857456/0 |title=The Man who took on Modi |date=9 October 2011 |newspaper=Indian Express |author=Leena Misra }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, Bhatt's colleagues from the 1988 batch had been promoted to the rank of [[Inspector-general of police]] (IGP). However, Bhatt had stayed at the SP level for a decade without any promotion, because of the pending criminal cases and departmental inquiries against him.&lt;ref name="IE_Leena_2011"/&gt;

== Allegations against Gujarat Government ==

=== Affidavit against Narendra Modi ===

After the 2002 riots, a group of social activists had formed the ''Concerned Citizens Tribunal'' to analyze the riots. Gujarat's home minister [[Haren Pandya]] allegedly told this tribunal that Modi had organised a meeting at the Chief Minister's residence on 27 February 2002, after the [[Godhra train burning]], in which over 50 Hindu pilgrims died. According to Pandya, in this meeting, Modi had asked the police officials not to come in the way of "the Hindu backlash". Pandya had named a number of police officials who attended this meeting; Bhatt was not among these. Pandya was later assassinated by unidentified men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=WxeLBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT192&amp;pg=PT192 |title=Gujarat Riots: The True Story |publisher=Partridge |year=2002 |author=M D Deshpande |isbn=9781482841633 |page=192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/a-plot-from-the-devils-lair/215889 |title=A Plot From The Devil's Lair |author=Manu Joseph and S Anand |publisher=Outlook |date=3 June 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 April 2011, 9 years after the riots, Bhatt filed an affidavit in the [[Supreme Court of India]], making similar allegations. According to Bhatt, at this meeting on 27 February 2002, Modi asked top police officials to let Hindus "vent out their anger" against the Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sanjiv-bhatt-dismissed-from-ips/article7558253.ece |title=Gujarat IPS officer who took on Modi after 2002 riots sacked |author=Mahesh Langa |newspaper=The Hindu |date=19 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the meeting determined to bring the bodies of the Hindu pilgrims to [[Ahmedabad]] prior to cremation, and that he had cautioned against this, fearing religious violence.&lt;ref name=HT20120104&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Ahmedabad/Sanjiv-Bhatt-seeks-access-to-state-IB-records-again/Article1-791275.aspx |title=Sanjiv Bhatt seeks access to state IB records again |publisher=Hindustan Times |location=Ahmedabad |date=4 January 2012 |accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, Modi's [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and the [[Hindutva|Hindu nationalist]] [[Bajarang Dal]] were stirring tensions in the city, and the [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) had proposed a [[bandh]] (an illegal general strike). Bhatt claimed that the then [[Director General of Police]], K. Chakravarthi, and the city Police Commissioner, [[P. C. Pandey]], had raised concerns regarding the manpower available to deal with this, and both men advised that it was not wise for the bodies to be taken to Ahmedabad.&lt;ref name="IT_sticks_2011" /&gt; Bhatt also says that he sent some fax messages to major officials soon after the meeting ended and that these referred to the meeting itself, the decision regarding the bodies of the dead and the growing activity of the BJP and Bajrang Dal.&lt;ref name=Hindu20120116 /&gt; Subsequently, riots occurred in which around 1000 people died,&lt;ref name=HT20120104 /&gt; three-quarters of whom were Muslim.&lt;ref name=BBC20071223&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC |location=London |title=Gujarat riot death toll revealed |date=11 May 2005 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4536199.stm |accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as a [[whistleblower]] both by some of the Indian media and some [[pressure group]]s, Bhatt has since referred to the events as "state-sponsored riots"&lt;ref name=ET20111018&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-10-18/news/30295906_1_sanjiv-bhatt-sabarmati-jail-ips-officer|title=IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt granted bail|publisher=The Economic Times |location=Ahmedabad |date=18 October 2011|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has alleged both that Modi told his officials to be "indifferent" towards rioters and said that Muslims needed to be "taught a lesson".&lt;ref name="IT_sticks_2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/godhra-sanjiv-bhatt-sticks-to-charges-against-narendra-modi-before-nanavati-panel/1/138369.html|title=Bhatt sticks to charges against Modi before Nanavati panel|publisher=India Today |location=Ahmedabad |date=16 May 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his affidavit, Bhatt mentioned six witnesses, who could testify his presence in the alleged meeting held at Modi's residence. He claimed that he had traveled to Modi's residence in the official car of K. Chakravarthi, which was being driven by Tarachand Yadav; Bhatt's own driver Constable KD Panth followed them in Bhatt's official car. Bhatt's affidavit was signed by KD Panth, whose statement supported Bhatt's presence at the alleged meeting. On 24 June 2011, Panth filed an [[First Information Report|FIR]] against Bhatt, alleging that Bhatt had threatened him and forced him to sign a false affidavit.&lt;ref name="TH_Manas_2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/modi-government-arrests-sanjiv-bhatt/article2500664.ece |title=Modi government arrests Sanjiv Bhatt |date=23 October 2011 |newspaper=The Hindu |author=Manas Dasgupta }}&lt;/ref&gt; Panth alleged that Bhatt took him to residence of [[Arjun Modhwadia]], the state president of the opposition party, [[Indian National Congress]]. He further alleged that Modhwadia asked him to obey Bhatt.&lt;ref name="FP_bail_2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/arrested-guj-cop-sanjeev-bhatt-granted-bail-109270.html |title=Arrested Guj-cop Sanjeev Bhatt granted bail |date=17 October 2011 |publisher=Firstpost }}&lt;/ref&gt; Panth claimed that he was on leave in February 2002, when the riots broke out, and had already told this to the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT).&lt;ref name="TH_Manas_2011"/&gt; Chakravarthi also denied that Bhatt was present in the meeting.&lt;ref name="IE_Leena_2011"/&gt;

However, Tarachand Yadav supported Bhatt, stating that he had driven Bhatt to Modi's bungalow, and that Panth had been with them. He also supported Bhatt's claim that he travelled there with Chakrabarthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/truth-lies-between-bhatt-s-exdriver-exboss/780573/0 |title=Truth lies between Bhatt’s ex-driver, ex-boss |date=24 April 2011 |newspaper=Indian Express }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When questioned why he had not made these revelations earlier, Bhatt stated that in 2004, he "started sending out feelers" that he wanted to be cross-examined by the Nanavati Commission, but the Commission had not called him.&lt;ref name="IE_Leena_2011"/&gt; In May 2011, Bhatt repeated the allegations made in his affidavit when he was called to give evidence to the NMC.&lt;ref name="IT_sticks_2011"/&gt; Prior to this appearance and in order to support the statements that he would make during it, Bhatt had attempted to obtain documents as evidence from the police and the [[State Intelligence Bureau]], as well as from the SIT hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/modiaccuser-cop-says-hes-being-denied-records/151852-3.html|title= Cop says he is being denied records.|publisher=IBN |location=Ahmedabad |first=Meghdoot |last=Sharon |date=10 May 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He again requested this information in December 2011, claiming that it was needed in order that it could be placed on the official record. These requests for information failed, and Bhatt alleged that this was because the Modi government opposed them because it was involved in a "cover up".&lt;ref name=HT20120104 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/modi-is-dramatis-personae-of-gujarat-carnage-2002-sanjiv-bhatt/891345/ |title=Modi is 'dramatis personae' of Gujarat 'carnage' 2002: Sanjiv Bhatt|publisher=Indian Express |date=23 December 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he alleged that the NMC had consistently refused to demand production of the documents, despite Bhatt's belief that it has the legal powers to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article2775308.ece |title=Nanavati panel can call for any document, insists Bhatt |publisher=The Hindu |date=5 January 2012 |accessdate=9 June 2012 |location=Chennai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhatt's ex-boss [[R. B. Sreekumar]] stated that Bhatt had never told him about his presence at the meeting during these nine years. But he told the [[Nanavati-Mehta commission|Nanavati Commission]] that in 2002, the Modi government had asked the State Intelligence Bureau to tap Haren Pandya's phone to confirm that he was the minister who talked to the ''Concerned Citizens Tribunal''. &lt;ref name="IE_Leena_2011"/&gt;

=== Allegations against SIT ruled baseless ===

In March 2008, the Supreme Court had appointed a Special Investigation Team (SIT), headed by former [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] chief [[R. K. Raghavan]], to investigate cases relating to the various incidents that had occurred during the 2002 riots. One of those who died in the [[Gulbarg Society massacre]] that formed a part of the riots was [[Ehsan Jaffri]], the former [[Indian National Congress]] [[Member of Parliament]]. His widow, Zakia Jaffri, subsequently became concerned about the involvement of senior officials in allegedly aiding and abetting the rioters and by the lack of legal action against them by the police. She petitioned the Court, alleging criminal conspiracy, a "deliberate and intentional failure" to protect life and property, and failure to fulfil their constitutional duty. In 2009, the Court responded by directing the SIT to investigate the actions of Modi and 62 other people, including Pandey and some VHP leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=The Economic Times |location=New Delhi |title=Scan Modi: SC to SIT |date=28 April 2009 |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2009-04-28/news/28480956_1_post-godhra-gulbarga-society-riots |accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhatt presented evidence to this particular SIT investigation in 2009.&lt;ref name=Statesman20110505&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;show=archive&amp;id=368433&amp;catid=36&amp;year=2011&amp;month=05&amp;day=6&amp;Itemid=66|title=SC for independent overview of SIT report |publisher=The Statesman |location=New Delhi |date=5 May 2011 |accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2011 affidavit, Bhatt accused the SIT of trying to "hide the truth behind the riots".&lt;ref name="IT_implicates_2011"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=India Today |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/2002-gujarat-riots-ips-officer-implicates-narendra-modi/1/136004.html |title=IPS officer implicates Narendra Modi in 2002 Gujarat riots |location=New Delhi |date=22 April 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhatt alleged that a mole in SIT leaked information to the Modi Government, through Gujarat's additional advocate general Tushar Mehta. Mehta and Bhatt were good friends since the 1980s, until 2010. Bhatt claimed that he happened to access Mehta's account to book two vacations for their families: one to Goa in September 2009 and another to the US in May-June 2010. At that time, he claims, he saw emails from SIT in Mehta's inbox. Mehta alleged that their friendship ended because of something that happened during their 2010 vacation in the US; he refused to go into details calling it a personal affair. In August 2011, Mehta lodged a complaint against Bhatt, accusing him of hacking into his email account. Bhatt's wife Shweta denied the accusation, stating that her husband only helped Mehta because the latter was not good with computers.&lt;ref name="IE_Leena_2011"/&gt;

The Court had previously appointed [[Raju Ramachandran]] to act as ''[[amicus curiae]]'' (friend of the court). Ramachandran had reviewed the original confidential SIT report that had been submitted in November 2010. His report was also confidential but prompted the Court to order the SIT to conduct a self-review. That self-review had been submitted in April 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-06/india/29516329_1_amicus-jakia-jafri-sanjiv-bhatt|title=SIT rejects Gujarat cop Bhatt's riot charges against Modi|publisher=The Times of India |location=New Delhi |first=Dhananjay |last=Mahapatra |date=6 May 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Court referred this for consideration by Ramachandran in May, which was also when it refused to accept Bhatt's affidavit.&lt;ref name=IT20110506&gt;{{cite news |title=Relief for Narendra Modi as SC doesn't take on record IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt's affidavit |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/the-supreme-court-has-rejected-sanjiv-bhatts-affidavit/1/137268.html |publisher=India Today |date=6 May 2011 |first=D. P. |last=Bhattacharya |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, Bhatt filed a [[Public-interest litigation (India)|Public-interest litigation]] (PIL) in the Supreme Court, calling for an independent agency to investigate the riots or, alternatively, for the case to be transferred outside Gujarat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/gujarat/sc-notice-to-centre-gujarat-govt-on-bhatt-s-pil_722852.html |title=SC notice to Centre, Gujarat govt on Bhatt’s PIL |publisher=Zee News |date=29 June 2011 |accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhatt also alleged that his emails had been hacked and filed a complaint against the state alleging that they had been leaked from the SIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/bhatt-vs-gujarat-govt-hacked-email-vs-email/827972/2 |title=Bhatt vs Gujarat govt: Hacked email vs email |publisher=Indian Express |date=6 August 2011 |accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/gujarat-riots-cases-compromised-allegations-of-leaks-via-emails-124613 |title=Gujarat riot cases compromised|publisher=NDTV |date=9 August 2011 |accessdate=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 October 2015, a bench comprising Supreme Court Chief Justice H L Dattu and Justice Arun Mishra ruled Bhatt's allegations against the SIT as totally "false and baseless".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It further rebuked Bhatt, ruling that "He had exchanged e-mails with rival political party leaders and was being tutored by the lawyer of an NGO and its activist... The petitioner has even sent e-mails to influence the judicial proceedings of a 3-Judge Bench of this court and has tried to influence the amicus curiae."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Suspension ===

On 8 August 2011, the Gujarat government suspended Bhatt, accusing him of unauthorised absence from duty, not appearing before an inquiry committee and using his official car while not on duty.&lt;ref name="ToI_2011_arrested"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Gujarat-IPS-officer-Sanjeev-Bhatt-who-took-on-Narendra-Modi-arrested/articleshow/10191519.cms |title=Gujarat IPS officer Sanjeev Bhatt who took on Narendra Modi arrested |date=1 October 2011 |newspaper=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhatt claimed that he was unable to report for work because he was required to attend various legal and investigatory hearings, including those of [[Nanavati-Mehta commission|Nanavati-Mehta Commission]] (NMC) — originally known as the Nanavati-Shah Commission — which had been established by the government of Gujarat.&lt;ref name="TH_Manas_2011"/&gt;

== Allegations in Haren Pandya murder case ==

The Gujarat government had originally appealed the court to drop charges against Bhatt and other policemen in the 1990 custodial death case. However, after Bhatt's affidavit against Modi, the Government withdrew its application, and the court initiated criminal proceedings against the policemen.&lt;ref name="IE_Leena_2011"/&gt; On 18 September, the Gujarat Home Ministry chargesheeted Bhatt in the 1990 police atrocity case.&lt;ref name="ToI_2011_arrested"/&gt; On 27 September 2011, Bhatt appeared before the Gujarat High Court in the police atrocity case against him in [[Jamnagar district]]. During the hearing, he told the Court that Narendra Modi and his former Home Minister [[Amit Shah]] had pressurised him to destroy crucial evidence in the [[Haren Pandya]] murder case.&lt;ref name="Outlook_2011_arrested"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/news/article/whistleblower-gujarat-cop-sanjiv-bhatt-arrested/736777 |title='Whistleblower' Gujarat Cop Sanjiv Bhatt Arrested |date=30 September 2011 |publisher=Outlook }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a fresh affidavit, Bhatt made detailed allegations against Modi and Shah. He claimed that while posted as Superintendent of the Sabarmati Jail in 2003, he had met Asgar Ali, an accused in the Haren Pandya murder case. Ali allegedly told him that Pandya had been killed by [[Tulsiram Prajapati]] (who was later killed in a [[fake encounter]] in 2006).&lt;ref name="IE_Leena_2011"/&gt; Bhatt claimed that he had immediately informed Home Minister Amit Shah about this revelation, but Shah asked him to destroy all documentary evidence related to this matter. He claimed that he had been removed as the Jail Superintendent because he had refused to obey Shah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/i-was-pressured-to-withdraw-my-report-on-haren-pandyas-murder/article2491315.ece |title=‘I was pressured to withdraw my report on Haren Pandya's murder' |date=28 September 2011 |author=Manas Dasgupta |newspaper=The Hindu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrest ==

On 30 September 2011, Bhatt was arrested, following an investigation into KD Panth's FIR. Bhatt alleged that Panth was following "diktats" from the Modi government, an allegation denied by Panth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/195685/not-facing-pressure-file-complaint.html |title=Not facing pressure to file complaint against Sanjeev Bhatt, says KD Panth |date=4 October 2011 |newspaper=Deccan Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhatt's arrest was condemned by the Congress leaders and human rights activists, who accused the Modi government of persecuting Bhatt.&lt;ref name="TH_Manas_2011"/&gt; The arrest gave rise to protests at places such as Ahmedabad, [[Delhi]] and [[Bangalore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_protest-marches-in-gujarat-cities-as-support-for-sanjiv-bhatt-swells_1594896|title=Protest marches in Gujarat cities as support for Sanjiv Bhatt swells|publisher=DNA India|date=4 October 2011 |accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gujarat IPS Officers Association also expressed their support for Bhatt and his family, although this was far from being unanimous and was downplayed by various senior officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/ips-officers-in-gujarat-pledge-support-to-sanjiv-bhatt/1/154358.html|title= IPS officers in Gujarat pledge support to Sanjiv Bhatt|publisher=India Today|date=10 September 2011|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhatt has referred to being harassed by members of the Gujarat police.&lt;ref name=IE20111017&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/sanjiv-bhatt-calls-modi-a-common-criminal/861179/|title=Sanjiv Bhatt calls Modi a 'common criminal'|publisher=Indian Express |date=17 October 2011 |accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 2011, Bhatt was granted [[bail]] by a local court in Ahmedabad, on condition that he continue to cooperate with investigations into the allegations laid against him. His bail application had been opposed by the Modi government.&lt;ref name=ET20111018 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/gujarat-suspended-ips-officer-sanjiv-bhatt-gets-bail/860916/0 |title=Gujarat: Suspended IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt gets bail |publisher=Indian Express |location=Ahmedabad |date=17 October 2011 |accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court suspended the case in April 2012, with Bhatt arguing that the arrest was "politically motivated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-17781286|title=India court stays trial of Gujarat riots policeman |publisher=BBC |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhatt was among those who refused to accept an award offered by the [[Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar Academy]] in 2011. This was because one of the co-awardees, [[Jagdish Tytler]], is alleged to have been involved in the [[1984 anti-Sikh riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_sanjiv-bhatt-refuses-to-receive-award-with-tainted-jagdish-tytler_1621893|title=Bhatt refuses to receive award with tainted Jagish Tytler |publisher=DNA |location=New Delhi |first=Iftikhar |last=Gilani |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, Bhatt and six other policemen were charged with murder in the 1990 custodial death case of Prabhudas Vaishnani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/IPS-Sanjiv-Bhatt-charged-with-murder/articleshow/17150821.cms |title=IPS Sanjiv Bhatt charged with murder |date=9 November 2012 |newspaper=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supreme Court ==

A former BBC journalist, Shubhranshu Choudhary, filed an affidavit in November 2011 that supported the claim that Bhatt was present at the 2002 meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesnow.tv/New-affidavit-supports-Bhatts-claim/articleshow/4388865.cms |title=New affidavit supports Bhatt's claim |publisher=The Times of India |date=13 November 2011 |accessdate=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, he requested that the SIT allow his testimony to be recorded in the presence of a magistrate as he believed that his earlier statements to it had been distorted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/sanjiv-bhatt-fires-a-stinker-to-sit-chief/886472/0 |title=Sanjiv Bhatt fires a stinker to SIT chief |publisher=Indian Express |date=11 December 2011 |accessdate=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made several similar requests thereafter.&lt;ref name=Hindu20120131 /&gt;

In January 2012, the SIT demanded the original copy of the fax messages that Bhatt claimed to have sent after the 2002 meeting and which, according to Bhatt, substantiated his presence at the meeting. Bhatt said that he had already provided the evidence in 2009 and again in 2011. He also noted that the SIT could get the information from the SIB records, and he claimed that the SIT was failing to interview police officials who could testify to his movements on the night in question.&lt;ref name=Hindu20120116&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2804179.ece |title=SIT asks Bhatt to produce original of crucial February 27, 2002 fax message |publisher=The Hindu |date=16 January 2012 |accessdate=12 June 2012 |location=New Delhi |first=Vidya |last=Subrahmaniam}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not the first occasion that he had alleged the SIT was reluctant to examine key witnesses who could verify his whereabouts at the time of the meeting.&lt;ref name=DNA20120106&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_sit-reluctant-to-examine-key-witnesses-in-riot-cases-sanjiv-bhatt_1634319 |title=SIT reluctant to examine key-witnesses in riot cases: Sanjiv Bhatt |publisher=DNA India |location=Ahmedabad |agency=PTI |date=6 January 2012 |accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhatt has produced evidence of police inaction to SIT chairman along with a letter which had details of deployment of police, SRP and RAF in the state, areas under curfew, types of crimes committed during the riots, etc. In that letter he also alleged delayed deployment of army. He insisted that those documents were intended for the sole purpose of ensuring that crucial evidence is not disregarded or concealed by the SIT with a view to screen powerful and influential offenders from legal punishment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/gujarat-riots-sanjiv-bhatt-submits-proof-of-police-inaction/904986/|title=Gujarat riots: Sanjiv Bhatt submits 'proof' of police inaction|publisher=Indian Express |date=28 October 2012 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bhatt in a letter written to SIT alleged that the probe team didn’t exhume the bodies from well of Naroday Patia despite strong evidences catered by him to support his claim. He also complained that Ahmedabad police commissioner P. C. Pandey was alerted on the same.&lt;ref name=Hindu20120131&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/article2845551.ece|title=Sanjiv Bhatt again rakes up bodies dumping issue |publisher=The Hindu |date=31 January 2012 |accessdate=31 January 2012 |location=Chennai |first=Manas |last=Dasgupta}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/SIT-did-not-exhume-bodies-from-Naroda-Patia-well-Bhatt/articleshow/11692863.cms |title=SIT did not exhume bodies from Naroda Patia well: Bhatt |publisher=The Times of India |date=31 January 2012|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, Bhatt accused the SIT of destroying evidence in collusion with the Gujarat government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2883098.ece |title=Modi Govt, SIT destroyed evidence says Bhatt |publisher=The Hindu |location=Ahmedabad |date=11 February 2012 |first=Manas |last=Dasgupta |accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhatt has once again written to the NMC seeking state intelligence and police records, documents and log books pertaining to Godhra riots as he thought the remaining records too may be destroyed by the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2883098.ece|title=Decision Godhra riots: Bhatt writes to probe panel again, seeks records|publisher=The Hindu |date=12 February 2012 |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also claimed before the panel that Modi was wantonly giving misleading answers and unfortunately the investigation officer didn’t contradict him with all evidences that were available at his disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article2929259.ece |title=Modi knew what was happening in Gulberg Society: Bhatt|publisher=The Hindu |date=25 February 2012 |accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhatt suggested in March 2012 that the final report of the NMC should be submitted to the governor of Gujarat rather than to its chief minister, Modi. He also thought that the earlier NMC report, which concerned the Godhra train incident and had been produced in 2008, should be recalled from the chief minister and presented instead to the governor. The basis for his request was that Modi's actions formed a part of the terms of reference of the enquiry and that ""no person shall be a judge in his own cause".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_nanavati-report-should-be-submiited-to-guj-governor-sanjiv-bhatt_1660782 |title=Nanavati report should be submiited to Guj Governor: Sanjiv Bhatt'|publisher=DNA India |location=Ahmedabad |agency=PTI |date=10 March 2012 |accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticised the earlier report, in which the NMC had exonerated Modi of any wrongdoing in relation to the riots. Bhatt believed that the NMC lacked the official authority to make such a statement. He also criticised the failure of the NMC to summon Modi to appear before it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_sanjiv-bhatt-questions-nanavati-commission-on-narendra-modi_1669498 |title=Sanjeev Bhatt questions Nanavati Commission on Modi |publisher=DNA |location=Ahmedabad |agency=PTI |date=30 March 2012 |accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a few days later he requested that Modi should be summoned on the basis of an affidavit that had been filed with the Commission by the late [[Amarsinh Chaudhary]], a former Gujarat Chief Minister, in 2002. Bhatt claimed that the affidavit showed that Chaudhary had met with Modi during the period of the riots because he was concerned about reports of events in the Gulbarg Society, including the situation of Ehsan Zafri. According to Bhatt, the affidavit records that Chaudhary had found Modi to be not very "responsive" when they met and that he had received reports that the police were not acting as they should during the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/article3282421.ece |title=Deliberate inaction on Modi's part during riots: Sanjiv Bhatt |first=Manas |last=Dasgupta |publisher=The Hindu |location= |date=5 April 2012 |accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supreme Court Ruling ===
Bhatt had filed a plea before the Supreme Court seeking a special investigative probe into two First Information Reports filed against him by the Gujarat Police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.legalera.in/news-deals/supreme-court/judgments/item/17682-sc-dismisses-ex-ips-officer-s-plea.html|title = Supreme Court dismisses plea of former IPS Officer|date = 13 October 2015|accessdate = 13 October 2015|website = legalera.in|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first FIR was for forcing his official driver, K D Panth, a subordinate officer, to file a false affidavit that he had transported Bhatt on 27 February 2002 to Chief Minister Narendra Modi's residence where Bhatt alleged that Modi had instructed officers to allow riots following the Godhra train carnage.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sacked IPS Sanjiv Bhatt didn't come with 'clean hands': SC - The Economic Times|url = http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/sacked-ips-sanjiv-bhatt-didnt-come-with-clean-hands-sc/articleshow/49341857.cms|website = The Economic Times|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second FIR was that he had hacked the email of a law enforcement official, namely Tushar Mehta, then additional advocate general of Gujarat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Supreme Court Dismisses Sanjiv Bhatt's Plea for SIT Probe|url = http://www.indiawest.com/news/india/supreme-court-dismisses-sanjiv-bhatt-s-plea-for-sit-probe/article_0d393032-718b-11e5-9463-bf5381b14b74.html|website = India West|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his plea before the court, Bhatt asserted that both FIRs filed against him were politically motivated and should be probed by a Supreme Court monitored investigative team to uncover abuse of power by the Modi government.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ex-Gujarat cop gets SC stick for ‘tutored’ riots remarks|url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/sc-dismisses-sanjiv-bhatt-s-2002-riots-plea-against-amit-shah/story-aQ5GnO7z2fxVN7iC4yugSN.html|website = [[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 October 2015, a bench comprising Chief Justice H L Dattu and Justice Arun Mishra dismissed Bhatt's plea and ordered a speedy trial to be conducted in both cases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Supreme Court dismisses plea of former IPS officer|url = http://www.legalera.in/news-deals/supreme-court/judgments/item/17682-sc-dismisses-ex-ips-officer-s-plea.html|website = www.legalera.in|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used email evidence to rule that Bhatt had deliberately colluded with leaders of the opposition Congress Party, NGO activists and certain elements in the media to furnish false evidence about his attendance at the 27 February 2002 meeting chaired by Modi so that he could falsely allege that Modi had incited riots.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;"The exchange of emails which are self-explanatory indicate that the petitioner was in active touch with leaders of rival political party, NGOs, their lawyers, tried to play media card, and was being tutored by NGOs. The manner in which he acted is apparent from the aforesaid emails and need not be repeated. Petitioner had probably forgotten that he was senior IPS officer," the bench said. Referring to his past conduct, the bench said there were three departmental inquiries pending against him and he was also accused of committing atrocities on peaceful and innocent villagers in Jamjodhpur which resulted in the death of one person. The court said Bhatt had also invoked the provisions of TADA during his tenure. Moreover, the Court condemned Bhatt's conduct as underhanded and unbefitting of a senior police officer. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sacked Gujarat Officer Sanjiv Bhatt Didn't Come With Clean Hands: Supreme Court|url = http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/supreme-court-rejects-plea-of-sacked-ips-officer-sanjiv-bhatt-for-sit-probe-1231531|website = NDTV.com|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court on 14th Oct. 2015 cleared the way for criminal prosecution of sacked IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt for allegedly hacking the email account of the then additional advocate general of Gujarat Tushar Mehta and for forcing a junior police official to file a false affidavit in a Gujarat riots case.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-allows-proceedings-against-Sanjiv-Bhatt-refuses-SIT-probe/articleshow/49344981.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhatt’s allegation on inaction of police officers upon instruction from Modi was also supported by K. S. Subramanian who was a member of fact finding team led by former Supreme Court Justice V. R. Krishna Iyer. His conclusion was the outcome of his interaction with former Gujarat police chief Chakravarthy and P.C. Pandey who was then Ahmedabad police commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Ex-top-cop-backs-Bhatt-s-charges-against-Narendra-Modi/Article1-812134.aspx|title=Ex-top cop backs Bhatt's charges against Narendra Modi|publisher = [[Hindustan Times]]|date= 16 February 2012|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a convention marking the tenth anniversary of the Godhra, Bhatt said that he is unable to see any justice for the victims of riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2961104.ece|title=Ten years on, no justice for Gujarat carnage victims, says Sanjiv Bhatt|publisher= www.thehindu.com|date= 5 March 2012|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhatt was issued summon by [[National Commission for Minorities]] along with other retired and serving police officers of Gujarat to testify the role of Modi to bring out the truth of 27 February 2002 meeting which held at Modi’s home. The summon was issued to Bhatt on the basis of a complaint filed by Niyazbibi Malek,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article2979127.ece|title=Minorities panel asks Bhatt, 6 others to testify on Modi meeting|publisher= www.thehindu.com|date= 10 March 2012|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhatt contacted [[Pratibha Patil]], the Indian President, in April 2012. He sought a probe against Modi. He has requested the centre to appoint two member commission to enquire the role and conduct of Modi, his officials and police officers in the Godhra massacre. He also demanded an investigation into the government’s measures on the rehabilitation for victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article3364586.ece |title=2002 riots: Bhatt appeals to President to appoint new probe panel |publisher=The Hindu |date=28 April 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SIT released all details of its investigations related to the Jaffri complaint of complicity on 7 May 2012, following deposition of its final report with the courts. The release included the two reports of Ramachandran, the ''amicus'', that had been submitted in January and July 2011. The documents revealed that the SIT believed that Bhatt had not been present at the meeting and that this was supported both by statements from those who had been present and by analysis of Bhatt's telephone records, which suggested that he was in Ahmedabad at the time.&lt;ref name=Hindu20120507&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3393808.ece |title=Proceed against Modi for Gujarat riots: amicus |publisher=The Hindu |location=Ahmedabad/New Delhi |date=7 May 2012 |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SIT also found that the fax message that Bhatt claimed to have sent never existed and he concocted it later and the signatures of his superior officers were forged.&lt;ref name=Hindu20120510&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3401728.ece |title=SIT rejects amicus curiae's observations against Modi |publisher=The Hindu |location=Ahmedabad |date=10 May 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their preliminary report did note that there was a lack of credibility among the witnesses present at the meeting, some of whom had retired and were claiming either a loss of memory or had been in receipt of retirement benefits that might impact upon their neutrality. In addition, the SIT considered Bhatt to be an unreliable witness who had attempted to coach other witnesses, had not provided adequate explanation for his nine-year silence regarding the events surrounding the meeting and had been imprecise in his description of the events. They also though that he had "an axe to grind" against the state.&lt;ref name=Hindu20120507/&gt;

The Ramachandran reviews painted a different picture. He queried how the SIT could rely on the testimony of witnesses who were present at the meeting when the investigation had itself raised doubts concerning their credibility, and he provided a rationale that could explain Bhatt's presence despite his relatively low rank. He also disputed the SIT conclusions regarding the telephone records analysis and said that the matter of presence needed to be tested in court because the evidence available was insufficient to discount Bhatt's claim. Bhatt had claimed that there were two meetings on the day in question, at different times. Ramachandran's reports also showed that he thought that, if they were true, the alleged statements made by Modi were actionable in law and that the veracity of those allegations should also be tested in court. Ramachandran accepted that Bhatt had not acted in a manner consistent with his official duties but noted that {{quote|In my opinion, despite the aforesaid background, it does not appear very likely that a serving police officer would make such a serious allegation against Mr. Modi, the Chief Minister of the State, without some basis. There is no documentary material of any nature whatsoever which can establish that Shri Bhatt was not present in the meeting on 27.02.2002.&lt;ref name=Hindu20120507 /&gt;}}

There were other differences of opinion between the SIT and Ramachandran but there were also points upon which they agreed. One of these was that the murdered [[Haren Pandya]], who had been the Gujarat Home Minister at the time of the riots but later had a falling out with Modi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/bhatt-lawyer-links-arrest-to-pandya-case/854188/|title=Bhatt lawyer links arrest to Pandya case |publisher=Indian Express |date=1 October 2011 |accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; could not have been at the meeting and therefore could not have vouched for Bhatt's presence there, as had been claimed by a former judge in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/2002-gujarat-riots-former-judge-speaks-out-against-modi-says-sit-ignored-testimonies-177298|title=Former judge says there’s audio tape with evidence against Modi.|publisher= NDTV |date=17 February 2012 |accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shweta Bhatt contested unsuccessfully against Modi in the 2012 state assembly elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/sanjiv-bhatts-wife-to-take-on-modi/article4149896.ece |title=Modi files papers as Congress fields Shweta Bhatt against him |newspaper=The Hindu |date=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the official release of the Amicus curiae’s report, ''[[The Times of India]]'' described Bhatt as pivot in the case against Modi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Sanjiv-Bhatt-the-pivot-in-case-against-Modi/articleshow/13059981.cms|title= Sanjiv Bhatt the pivot in case against Modi|publisher=[[the Times of India]]|date= 9 May 2012|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhatt criticised the published SIT report on the Godhra attack, claiming that the SIT was shielding Modi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3426438.ece|title= Your closure report a bid to shield Modi, Bhatt tells Raghavan |publisher =[[The Hindu]]|date= 17 May 2012|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides his deposition before NCM, Bhatt has filed an affidavit in National Commission of Minorities (NCM).In his affidavit Bhatt has asked the rights panel to initiate action against the SIT headed by R K Raghavan for incorrectly recording his statements or tweaking them to give a clean chit to Chief Minister Narendra Modi.
He also alleged that certain very crucial portions of his statement, including the timings of extremely consequential meetings with the chief minister Narendra Modi on 27 February &amp; 28 February 2002, have either been incorrectly recorded or deliberately tweaked by the SIT, possibly with the ulterior motive and intent of shielding certain powerful persons including the chief minister from legal punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/sit-played-with-evidence-bhatt-tells-ncm/955592/|title = SIT played with evidence,Bhatt tells NCM|publisher = [[the Indian Express]] |date= 30 May 2012|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal safety ==

Concerns have been raised at various times regarding the personal safety of Bhatt. At the time of filing his Supreme Court affidavit in April 2011, Bhatt requested the Court for protection&lt;ref name="IT_implicates_2011" /&gt; and the Gujarat government assured the Supreme Court that it would provide personal safety arrangements.&lt;ref name=Outlook20120214&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=751360|title=Bhatt Demands Adequate Security From Gujarat Govt |publisher=Outlook |date=14 February 2012 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation had arisen because Bhatt believed that the SIT had passed on his testimony to the state government and thus he feared for the security of himself and his family.&lt;ref name=NDTV20110423&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/bhatt-s-driver-backs-his-claim-says-he-went-to-modi-s-house-on-day-of-meet-100883|title=Gujarat police officer’s driver backs his claim|publisher=NDTV |location=New Delhi |date=23 April 2011 |accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife, Shweta, alleged that there was harassment during the period that he spent in jail under arrest in October 2011. She requested that the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] (MHA) of the [[Government of India]] intervene to ensure that both he and his family were protected. The MHA instructed the government of Gujarat accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/home-ministry-gujarat-ips-pfficer-sanjeev-bhatt-security/1/153665.html |title=Home ministry writes to Gujarat Govt on IPS officer Sanjeev Bhatt|publisher=India Today |date=4 October 2011|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhatt had been provided with two personal guards but considered this to be insufficient. In November 2011 he requested improved security, including provision of a bullet proof car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/bhatt-seeks-more-security-bulletproof-car/871819/0 |title=Bhatt seeks more security|publisher=Indian Express |date=7 November 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated his demands in February 2012, when he also raised objections on personal safety grounds to a request from the Gujarat police that he should return his service revolver.&lt;ref name=Outlook20120214 /&gt;

In November 2013 Bhatt alleged that city police was not providing him adequate security, and there was an increased threat to his and his family members' lives from the "right-wing fundamentalists and the supporters of [[Narendra Modi]]". Earlier, Bhatt had alleged that his security had been downsized. The office of Commissioner of Police Shivanand Jha said that after the assessment of threat perception, it was decided that Bhatt should be provided with two armed personal security officers. However, Bhatt wrote to the commissioner, saying that he was being "provided with only one armed PSO".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/bhatt-complains-he-is-not-getting-adequate-security-113110900696_1.html |title=Bhatt complains he is not getting adequate security | publisher=Business Standard |date=9 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Removal from Service ==

Bhatt was removed from the IPS on 19 August 2015 on the ground of "unauthorised absence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Suspended Gujarat IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt sacked - The Times of India|url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Suspended-Gujarat-IPS-officer-Sanjiv-Bhatt-sacked/articleshow/48546732.cms|accessdate = 2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2177">'''Sarvanivāraṇaviṣkambhin''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: Chú Gàizhàng Púsà 除蓋障菩薩; or Jìngzhū Yèzhàng Púsà 凈諸業障菩薩; [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]: སྒྲིབ་པ་རྣམ་སེལ་ ''Dribpa Namsel'') is a [[bodhisattva]] revered in [[Mahāyāna Buddhism]]. He is one of the Eight Great Bodhisattvas with [[Mañjuśrī]], [[Samantabhadra]], [[Avalokiteśvara]], [[Mahāsthāmaprāpta]], Âkāśagarbha ([[Akasagarbha]]), [[Kṣitigarbha]] and [[Maitreya]].

==Role==
He is invoked to remove or eliminate all the obstacles to insure a successful meditation.

==Nivāraṇa==
Although the eight Mahāsattvas belong to the current Mahāyāna, the term nivāraṇa is most commonly used in the Theravada texts where it refers to the five mental obstacles: desire (kamacchanda), hostility (vyapada), laziness (thinamiddha), distraction and worry (uddhachcha-kukuchcha), doubts (vichikicha) towards the [[Three Jewels]]. Sarvanivāraṇaviṣkambhi is best known to meditators and is not an important subject to individual worship like the other seven mahāsattvas.

==In Vajrayāna==
In Tantric Buddhism, he is usually placed in the lineage of [[Amoghasiddhi]] Buddha, one of the five Dhyani Buddhas, more rarely of [[Akshobhya]] Buddha. He is sometimes considered a form of [[Vajrapāṇi]], though this is most likely a confusion with the mahāsattva Mahāsthāmāprāpta which Vajrapāṇi is one of its incarnations.

==Iconography==
In iconography, he has often a flower in one hand, sometimes with a jewel (Cintamaṇi).

==Sutras concerned==
He is mentioned in the [[Lotus Sutra]], in which he pays homage to Avalokiteśvara, and in the [[Mahavairocana Tantra]].

==Mantra==
The mantra of this great bodhisattva to remove all obstacles and disturbances mentioned in the Vairocana-sūtra, is as follows: 

'''namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ/ aḥ/ sattva hitābhyudgata/ traṃ/ traṃ/ raṃ/ raṃ/ svāhā'''

'''William Bernard Ziff Sr.''' (August 1, 1898 &amp;ndash; December 20, 1953) was an American publishing executive and author.

==Biography==
He was born on August 1, 1898. He died on December 20, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=W. B.

Davis]] founded the magazine publisher [[Ziff Davis|Ziff Davis Inc.]] during 1927. After his death during 1953, his son [[William Bernard Ziff Jr.]] succeeded him at Ziff Davis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=William B.

He was 76. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=September 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Being of Jewish ancestry and motivated by the power of [[Nazi Germany]] during the 1930s, Ziff became one of the most prominent American endorsers of [[Revisionist Zionism]]. During 1935, he was persuaded by devotees of the Revisionist Zionist spokesman [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] to accept the presidency of the Zionist-Revisionists of America organization although he resigned after one year, being uncomfortable with his role as a Jewish organizational official. Ziff remained active with Zionist politics and caused controversy whan he authored during 1938 a criticism of British policy in the Holy Land entitled ''The Rape of Palestine.'' The [[British Foreign Office]] declared the book "violent and offensive" and monitored Ziff thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vMl0-azdbVYC&amp;pg=PT50&amp;lpg=PT50&amp;dq=American+Friends+of+a+Jewish+Palestine++ziff&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GqDEcO1avu&amp;sig=XYERd2o7D9BGlHyldq_5N3tqfM4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8rh4T9v8I6bZ0QGSlo2yDQ&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20Friends%20of%20a%20Jewish%20Palestine%20%20ziff&amp;f=false "Militant Zionism in America: The Rise and Impact of the Jabotinsky Movement in the United States, 1926-1948" by Rafael Medoff] University Alabama Press; 1 edition (July 2, 2002) pp 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wymaninstitute.org/press/2004-02-18.php The David S.

[[General (Canada)|General]] '''Sir William Dillon Otter''', {{postnominals|country=CAN|size=100%|sep=,|KCB|CVO|VD}} (December 3, 1843 – May 6, 1929) was a professional Canadian soldier who became the first Canadian-born [[Commander of the Canadian Army|Chief of the General Staff]], the head of the [[Canadian Militia]].

==Military career==
Otter was born near [[The Corners, Canada West]]. His parents were Anna Louisa, née de la Hooke (1824–1907) and Alfred William Otter (1815–1866),&lt;ref&gt;The son of [[William Otter]], Bishop of Chichester&lt;/ref&gt; both English immigrants who married in Ontario on 15 September 1842. He began his military career in the [[Non-Permanent Active Militia]] in [[Toronto]] in 1864. Captain William Otter was Adjutant of the [[Queen's Own Rifles of Toronto]] in 1866. He first saw combat with them at the [[Battle of Ridgeway]] during the [[Fenian Raids]].

He joined the [[Permanent Active Militia|Permanent Force]] as an [[infantry]] officer when Canada established its own professional infantry unit in 1883. On May 2, 1885, he led a Canadian force of more than 300 in the [[Battle of Cut Knife]] against [[Pitikwahanapiwiyin|Poundmaker's]] [[Cree]] Indians. Otter's tactics were ineffective against the defending warriors, forcing him to retreat.

In 1890, Otter founded the [[Royal Canadian Military Institute]] as a body for "the promotion and fostering of military art, science and literature in Canada." The Gen Sir William Otter Papers are selected from those presented at events organized by the Defence Studies Committee of the Royal Canadian Military Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcmi.org/publications/otter-papers.html Gen Sir William Otter Papers]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed as the first Commanding Officer of the [[Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry]] in 1893.

Lieutenant Colonel Otter commanded the Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry at the time of the [[Second Boer War]], during which he played an important part in the Battle of Paardeburg. Otter commanded the 2nd (Special Service) Battalion of The Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry in South Africa, where they were considered by many British officers to be the best infantry [[battalion]] in the country. He became the first Canadian-born officer to command Canada's military in 1908, and he retired in 1910 as a full general.  Otter had the reputation of being something of a [[martinet]] – due mainly to his desire that the young Canadian Army should not show up badly when compared to British troops.&lt;ref&gt;Brian A Reid ''"Our Little Army in the Field – The Canadians in the Boer War"''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:William D Otter.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Lieutenant Colonel William Dillon Otter]]

He wrote ''The Guide: A Manual for the Canadian Militia (Infantry) Embracing the Interior Economy, Duties, Discipline, Drills and Parades, Dress, Books, and Correspondence of a Battalion with Regulations for Marches, Transport &amp; Encampment, Also Forms &amp; Bugle Calls'' in 1914, which includes sections on discipline, courts martial, offences, complaints, and defaulters.

During the First World War he came out of retirement to command operations for the [[internment]] of enemy nationals resident in Canada.

Otter headed the [[Otter Commission]]. The Otter Commission was tasked to establish links of perpetuation from the units of [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] back to the institutionally separate units of the [[Canadian Militia]] in the years following the First World War.  This establishment of perpetuation, based primarily on geographical connections through original recruiting areas of the [[List of infantry battalions in the Canadian Expeditionary Force|CEF battalions]], provided a basis by which the achievements and battle honours of the CEF units transferred back to the units of the standing Militia.  Without this work of the Otter Commission the CEF and its achievements would have had no continuance with existing units of the Canadian Army today.

General Sir William Otter died on 6 May 1929.

==Freemason==
Otter was initiated into the Ionic Lodge of Freemasonry in Toronto in February 1869.  He became Worshipful Master in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/ionic025/notable-members/otter William Dillon Otter in Ionic Lodge]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tallon grew up in Norman Place Road, [[Coundon]], Coventry and attended Barkers Butts Secondary Modern School.&lt;ref name=CTelegraph2008-07-16/&gt;

==Work with the Royal Family==
Tallon's first job in the Royal Household was as a junior assistant, at Easter Court at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] in 1951, at age 13. He had been writing letters asking for work with the Household for the previous five years. He was later employed at [[Buckingham Palace]]. He was set to join [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] on her [[Commonwealth]] tour in 1953-1954 but was kept back and did his  [[National Service]] with the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]. Subsequently, he asked [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] if he could join the staff at her home, [[Clarence House]]. She agreed, and he remained with her until her death in 2002.&lt;ref name=Telegraph2007-11-26 /&gt;&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{citation|publisher=Daily Mail |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1245565/Revealed-The-secret-life-Backstairs-Billy-Queen-Mothers-loyal-servant.html|title=The secret life of Backstairs Billy, the Queen Mother's most loyal servant|date=28 January 2010|accessdate=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death in 2000 of his partner, Reg Wilcock,&lt;ref name=Telegraph2007-12-07/&gt; the ''House Deputy Steward'' and the Queen Mother's ''Page of the Presence'', Tallon reportedly suffered from depression. When the Queen Mother passed away he was heart broken.&lt;ref name=Telegraph2007-11-26/&gt; When she died in 2002, at age 101, Tallon left Clarence House. He settled in a ground-floor flat with a garden in [[Kennington]], where he was found dead on 23 November 2007, at age 72.&lt;ref name=Telegraph2007-11-29/&gt;

In 2014 Buckingham Palace reacted angrily to suggestions made in ''The Royal Life Of William Tallon'', a biography of Tallon written by Tom Quinn, that the Queen Mother "was frequently drunk and "dotty" for the final 20 years of her life." The Queen Mother's niece and former [[lady-in-waiting]], Margaret Rhodes, denied that the Queen Mother drank [[gin and tonic]], claiming that she favoured a "gin martini mix which she usually made herself".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/palace-anger-over-statements-that-queen-mother-was-insane-drunk-1481125]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
*A [[Channel 4]] documentary, ''Backstairs Billy: The Queen Mum's Butler'', was broadcast in 2009.

==Awards==
He was one of the few holders of the [[Royal Victorian Medal]] in Gold, being the highest  award in the lowest grade of the [[Royal Victorian Order]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph2007-11-26/&gt; He received the Royal Victorian Medal (Gold) in June 2001, and his 50-year Service Clasp earlier that year.&lt;ref name=Telegraph2002-08-05/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5143">'''Xerxes Desai''' was the first managing director of [[Titan Company]], an Indian watchmaking company, and played an instrumental role in laying the foundation of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Companies/WFxqxvGSp7YIsqK2LecftJ/Xerxes-Desai-The-timekeeper.html|title=Xerxes Desai: The timekeeper|last=Tandon|first=Suneera|date=2016-06-09|website=Live Mint|access-date=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Desai was a graduate of [[Elphinstone College]] ([[University of Mumbai|Mumbai University]]) and [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Companies/WFxqxvGSp7YIsqK2LecftJ/Xerxes-Desai-The-timekeeper.html|title=Xerxes Desai: The timekeeper|last=Tandon|first=Suneera|date=2016-06-09|website=Live Mint|access-date=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desai joined [[Tata Administrative Services]] in 1961 after graduation, working at several of their companies. He founded Titan as a joint venture with  [[J. R. D. Tata]] in 1986, with support from the [[Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/Titans-founding-MD-Xerxes-Desai-dies-at-79/articleshow/52947577.cms|title=Titan’s founding MD Xerxes Desai dies at 79 - Times of India|website=Times of India|access-date=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had suggested the idea of a watchmaking company to Tata in the 1970s, who liked it, but bureaucratic hassles took time till the company was opened in 1986 in [[Hosur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/business/report/xerxes-desai-the-man-behind-titans-success/20160628.htm|title=Xerxes Desai: The man behind Titan's success|website=Rediff|access-date=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/article/fe-columnist/end-of-a-titan/300226/|title=Xerxes Desai, the Titan who changed the way Indians kept time dies|date=2016-06-29|website=The Financial Express|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZawvddLxmMwC|title=World Class In India|last=Ghoshal|first=S.|date=2002-03-04|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9789351180272|language=en|chapter=The Indian Watch Industry: Titanic Changes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Desai challenged engineers at Titan to design the world's thinnest watch, with a movement 1.15mm thick inside a 3.5mm case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OE37CgAAQBAJ|title=Innovation Strategy for Enterprises in Emerging Economies: Case Studies for the Digital Age|last=Satpathy|first=Anurag|last2=Agrawal|first2=Arjun|last3=Mohapatra|first3=Sanjay|date=2015-11-16|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=9781785604805|pages=115–117|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The watch, called the Titan Edge was introduced in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KdVZAgAAQBAJ|title=Orbit-Shifting Innovation: The Dynamics of Ideas that Create History|last=Narang|first=Rajiv|last2=Devaiah|first2=Devika|date=2014-01-03|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|isbn=9780749468767|pages=165–166|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Titan's success, Desai founded [[Tanishq]], a jewelry brand. He had innovative ideas like asking people in Bangalore to get their jewelry appraised in 1999. The jewelry business grew over time, after a slow start.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/xerxes-desai-the-titan-behind-the-timekeeper-116062700808_1.html|title=Xerxes Desai: The titan behind the timekeeper|last=Krishnan|first=Raghu|website=Business Standard|access-date=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desai retired in 2002, and was succeeded by his protegé Bhaskar Bhat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.digitaltoday.in/businesstoday/20020414/people.html|title=A Titan Departs|last=|first=|date=2002-04-14|website=|publisher=Business Today Archives|access-date=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post retirement ===
