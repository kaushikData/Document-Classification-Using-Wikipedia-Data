The '''[[1974–75 WHA season|1974–75]] [[Quebec Nordiques]] [[season (sports)|season]]''' was the Nordiques' [[Quebec Nordiques seasons|third]] season, as they were coming off a 38–36–4 record in 1973–74, earning 80 points, however, they failed to qualify for the post-season for the 2nd straight season.

The Nordiques would have to find a new head coach during the off-season, as [[Jacques Plante]] would come out of retirement and play with the [[Edmonton Oilers]].  Quebec hired recently retired and former team captain [[Jean-Guy Gendron]] to become the clubs 4th head coach in team history.  The club would also move from the Eastern Division to join the newly created Canadian Division, which consisted of the other 4 Canadian clubs in the league.

Quebec would start off the season very strong, and fight with the [[Toronto Toros]] for top spot in the division all season long.  Through 66 games, the Nordiques had a 42–24–0 record, 8 points ahead of the 2nd place Toros, however, the team would suffer through a 7-game losing streak, and the Toros would catch up to the Nordiques.  Quebec would win 4 of their final 5 games, and win the division championship, and make the playoffs for the first time in club history.

Offensively, the Nordiques were once again led by [[Serge Bernier]], who finished 3rd in league scoring with 122 points, as he scored 54 goals and added 68 assists.  [[Réjean Houle|Rejean Houle]] put together a solid season, scoring 40 goals and earning 92 points, while new team captain [[Michel Parizeau]] had 74 points.  [[Marc Tardif]], acquired by Quebec from the [[Michigan Stags]] during the season, scored 38 goals and earned 72 points in 53 games with the Nordiques.  [[J. C. Tremblay]] led the blueline with 72 points in 68 games, while [[Dale Hoganson]] chipped in with 9 goals and 44 points.  [[Pierre Roy]] led the club with 118 penalty minutes.

In goal, [[Richard Brodeur]] took the starters job, and won a team high 29 games while posting a 3.90 GAA in 51 games.  [[Serge Aubry]] backed up Brodeur, and won 17 games with a team best 3.71 GAA.

In the opening round of the playoffs, the Nordiques faced the [[Phoenix Roadrunners (WHA)|Phoenix Roadrunners]], who finished 4th in the Western Division with 86 points, 6 fewer than Quebec.  The Nordiques would win their first ever playoff game, defeating the Roadrunners 5–2 at [[Le Colisée]].  Quebec went up 2–0 in the series with a solid 6–2 win, as the series moved west to Phoenix.  The Nordiques shutout the Roadrunners 3–0 to take a commanding 3–0 series lead, however, they could not complete the sweep, as Phoenix won game 4 in overtime.  The series returned to Quebec for game 5, and the Nordiques would win the game 4–2, and take the series in 5 games.

Up next for the Nordiques was the [[Minnesota Fighting Saints]], who during the season, had a 42–33–3 record, earning 87 points, as they finished 3rd in the Western Division.  Minnesota defeated the [[New England Whalers]] in the first round of the playoffs.  The series opened in Quebec, and the clubs split the first two games, as the series shifted to Minnesota.  Quebec took a 2–1 series lead with a big 6–1 win in the 3rd game, however, the Fighting Saints fought back in game 4, evening the series with a 4–2 victory.  Quebec would easily win the 5th game, doubling Minnesota 6–3 at Le Colisée, and the Nordiques would close out the series in the 6th game, defeating Minnesota 4–2, and advance to the [[Avco Cup]] Finals.

Quebec would face the defending Avco Cup champion [[Houston Aeros (WHA)|Houston Aeros]] in the finals.  The Aeros finished the season with a league best 106 points, and had easily beat the [[Cleveland Crusaders]] and [[San Diego Mariners]] to reach the finals.  Houston, led by [[Larry Lund]] and [[Gordie Howe]] were heavy favourites to win the series.  The series opened in Houston, with the Aeros defeating Quebec 6–2 in the series opener, then took a 2–0 series lead with a 5–3 win in the second game.  The series moved to Quebec for the next 2 games, however, it was the Aeros who continued to win, as they shutout the Nordiques 2–0 in the third game, and would sweep Quebec with a huge 7–2 victory in the fourth game, winning the Avco Cup for the second time in as many years.

'''Al-Shorta Stadium''' ({{lang-ar|ملعب الشرطة}}), nicknamed '''The Cage''', was a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]].  It was used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and served as the home stadium of [[Al-Shorta]]. It held approximately 7,000 people. The white hall on the side of the field could hold approximately 2,000 people. The stadium had no seats, but instead there were stairs on each side of the playing field and spectators sat or stood on these stairs. It was home to many great matches for Al-Shorta. It was built by volunteers and Al-Shorta fans and staff at the club, making the stadium even more special. Abdul-Kadir Zeinal, Al-Shorta's manager from 1975 to 1979, was the man who came up with the idea of building the stadium and the supporters approved of the idea and helped to build the stadium. After a few years of construction, the stadium was opened in 1983. In 2008, the stands were painted green and white to match the club's colours.

The '''''Badminton Library''''', called in full '''''The Badminton Library of Sports and Pastimes''''', was a sporting and publishing project conceived and founded by [[Henry Somerset, 8th Duke of Beaufort]] (1824–1899). Between 1885 and 1902 it developed into a series of sporting books which aimed to cover comprehensively all major sports and [[hobby|pastimes]]. The books were published in London by [[Longmans, Green &amp; Co.]]&lt;ref name=wychwood&gt;[http://www.wychwoodbooks.com/categories.php?subject=16 Badminton Library] at wychwoodbooks.com (accessed 3 April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Boston]] by [[Little, Brown &amp; Co.]]

The series was dedicated to [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales]], "one of the best and keenest sportsmen of our time".&lt;ref name=staffs&gt;[http://www.staffs.ac.uk/uniservices/infoservices/library/about/collections/special/badminton/index.php Badminton Collection – Special Collection (SPC.10)] online at staffs.ac.uk (accessed 3 April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Illinois&gt;[http://www.library.uiuc.edu/rbx/exhibitions/Victorian%20Entertainments/catalog/catalog.html Victorian Entertainments: We Are Amused An Exhibit Illustrating Victorian Entertainment] at the Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library of the [[University of Illinois]] (Item 31: Golf in 1890, Item 32: Skating in 1892, Item 33: Cricket in 1888, Item 34: Cycling in 1887) online at library.uiuc.edu (accessed 3 April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editor==
The founder of the Library, the Duke of Beaufort, acted as its overseeing editor, assisted by Alfred E. T. Watson,&lt;ref name=staffs/&gt; and chose authors who were authorities in their fields. Explaining his purpose, the Duke said:&lt;ref name=wychwood/&gt; {{cquote|...there is no modern encyclopaedia to which the inexperienced man, who seeks guidance in the practice of various British sports and pastimes, can turn for information".}}

==Description==
The ''Badminton Library'' was originally published in twenty-eight volumes between 1885 and 1896. To these was later added ''Rowing &amp; Punting'' (1898), superseding ''Boating'' (1888). New volumes for ''Athletics'' (1898) and ''Football'' (1899) supplemented the original ''Athletics and Football'' (1887). In 1902, the final entirely new volume, ''Motors and Motor-Driving'', covered a new sport, and lastly there was a new edition of ''Cricket'' in 1920.&lt;ref name=wychwood/&gt;

On the combining of athletics and football in a single volume, Mike Huggins says in ''The Victorians and Sport'' (2004) that it suggests "...that football's leading place was not yet assured amongst the more literate reading public."&lt;ref&gt;Huggins, Mike, ''The Victorians and Sport'' (London, [[Continuum International Publishing Group]], 2004, {{ISBN|1-85285-415-4}}) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The original volume on ''Cricket'' (1888) has sixteen chapters on topics such as 'Batting', 'Bowling', 'Fielding', and 'Umpires'. It defines the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] as "The Parliament of Cricket" and describes the sport as "Our National Game".&lt;ref name=Illinois/&gt; [[Allan Gibson Steel]] wrote the chapter on bowling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/133901.html | title=Allan Gibson Steel – A tribute | journal=[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] | year=1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cycling'' (1887), by [[William Keppel, 7th Earl of Albemarle|Viscount Bury]], notes that riding the [[tricycle]] and bicycle, whether by women or by men, "is by far the most recent of all sports in the Badminton Library of Sports and Pastimes. There is none which has developed more rapidly in the last few years." It considers that "England may be looked upon as the Home of Cycling" and quotes [[Thomas Huxley]]'s words to the [[Royal Society]]: "Since the time of [[Achilles]], no improvement had added anything to the speed or strength attainable by the unassisted powers of man", commenting that a bicyclist had recently raced 146 miles in only ten hours.&lt;ref name=Illinois/&gt;

''Skating'' (1892) deals first with 'Origins and Development', '[[Figure skating]]', and 'Recreation and Racing', noting that [[Holland]] was "the Skater's Paradise" and giving a list of racing records since the 1820s, then continues with chapters on [[Curling]], [[Toboggan]]ing, [[Sailing|Ice-Sailing]] and [[Bandy]].&lt;ref name=Illinois/&gt;

Laura and Guy Waterman's ''Yankee Rock &amp; Ice'' (2002) calls the Badminton Library "a quaint turn-of-the-century British series",&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, Laura, Waterman, Guy, &amp; Lewis, S. Peter, ''Yankee Rock &amp; Ice: A History of Climbing in the Northeastern United States'' ([[Stackpole Books]], 2002, {{ISBN|0-8117-3103-0}}) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3LtZKlCrK5gC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22Badminton%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bp4zlzaU9L&amp;sig=PpD2NUnqUq4mNwRLInKLknuXUSk&amp;hl=en page 16] online at books.google.co.uk (accessed 3 April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; while a review of the publication ''Collectors Guide to the Badminton Library of Sports and Pastimes'' says of the books:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serious-collector.com/wst_page2.html review of Badminton Library Guide] online at serious-collector.com (accessed 3 April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|If the series were to be issued today it might more appropriately be called ''Sports and Pastimes for the [[British nobility|British Aristocrat]]'' to more accurately reflect its content.}}

A useful series for purposes of comparison is the slightly later ''[[American Sportsman's Library]]''.

==Editions==
The ''Badminton Library'' was published in three different formats:&lt;ref name=wychwood/&gt;

#The '''standard trade edition''': [[octavo (book)|octavo]], bound in brown illustrated cloth.
#The '''deluxe edition''': octavo, bound in half blue Morocco, gilt titles to the spines and bright orange boards with a gilt coat of arms to the upper board, top page edges gilt.
#The '''large paper deluxe edition''': large octavo or [[quarto]], a limited edition of only two hundred and fifty copies, also bound in half blue Morocco and much the same in appearance as the deluxe edition.

==Name==
The name 'Badminton Library' was derived from that of Duke of Beaufort's principal [[English country house|country house]], [[Badminton House|Badminton]] in Gloucestershire. There is no volume in the series on the sport of Badminton, named after the same house.&lt;ref name=wychwood/&gt;

The '''Ellis F. Corbett Health, Physical Education and Recreation Center''', usually called simply the '''Corbett Sports Center''' and popularly referred to as the "Dawg Pound", is a multi-purpose arena in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], United States, on the campus of [[North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University]]. The complex is home to multiple [[North Carolina A&amp;T Aggies]] athletic teams, including the [[North Carolina A&amp;T Aggies#Men's basketball|men's]] and [[North Carolina A&amp;T Aggies#Women's basketball|women's basketball]] teams as well as the women's volleyball and swimming teams. The complex, opened in 1978, is named after Ellis F. Corbett, a 1931 graduate of A&amp;T. Affectionately known as "Mr.A&amp;T", Corbett was, for many years, the director of public relations and executive secretary of the national alumni association.&lt;ref name="Bluford Library"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bluford Library - Archives and Special Collections|publisher=NC A&amp;T State University Library|date=2010-07-15|url=http://www.library.ncat.edu/info/archives/athleticsbldgs_new.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Information==
The three story complex houses office space, classrooms, two racquetball courts in addition to an Olympic sized swimming pool. In 2005, The basketball court was named the Cal Irvin-[[Don Corbett]] basketball court after two of the most Notable coaches in Aggie history. Irwin's legacy stems from his 18 season run as the Aggies Basketball coach. During his tenure, the Aggies never finished below .500. Irvin’s success would carry the Aggies over from the [[Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association|Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA)]] into the [[Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference]], where he won the school’s first league championship in 1972. Irvin's held a 308-105 record as coach of the Aggies. His first CIAA championship came in 1958. Irvin’s teams won CIAA titles in 1959,1962, 1964, and 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCA&amp;T Basketball Media Guide|author=NC A&amp;T SU Sports Information|publisher=NCATAggies.com|accessdate=2010-05-274|url=http://www.ncataggies.com/fls/24500/old_site/Mensbasketball/2009-10%20ARTICLES/2009-10%20MBB%20WEB%20GUIDE/%283%29_MBB_INTRO.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=24500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flamengo de Sucre''' is a [[Bolivia]]n [[association football|football]] club from [[Sucre]], [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca department]].

==History==
Flamengo de Sucre was founded on May 27, 1966 as Club Atlético Flamengo (or CAFLA) by Bolivian supporters of [[Brazil]]ian club [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo]]. Some time later, the club was renamed to the same name of the Brazilian club.&lt;ref name="lanceflamengodesucre"&gt;{{cite journal |date=February 3, 2007 |title=Flamengo de Sucre |journal=[[Lance!]] | location=Rio de Janeiro |issue=3.388 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club joined the Liga Profesional de Sucre (Sucre Professional League) in 1977.&lt;ref name="lanceflamengodesucre"/&gt; The club competed in the league for three consecutive years, but, due to an amateur administration and lack of resources, the club was eventually relegated to the second division.&lt;ref name="lanceflamengodesucre"/&gt;

The club closed its professional football section in 1989.&lt;ref name="lanceflamengodesucre"/&gt; In 1996 the Bolivian president re-opened the club. As of 2010 they play in Chuquisaca Primera A.

On June 21, 2011,  Flamengo de Sucre won the Primera "A", organized by the Association Football of Chuquisaca(ACHF), for the first time in its 46 years of institutional life, defeating in the Torneo Adequación final the Club Fancesa 2–1 in a match played at the Estadio Patria.

==Other sports==

The '''Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre''' (GCCEC) is located on the [[Gold Coast Highway]] in [[Broadbeach, Queensland|Broadbeach]], [[Gold Coast, Queensland]]. The world-class venue was opened on 29 June 2004 at a cost of A$167&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name="gcc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/t_standard.aspx?pid=3871 |title=Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre |date=23 June 2010 |publisher=Gold Coast City Council |accessdate=6 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107184441/http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/t_standard.aspx?pid=3871 |archivedate=7 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is linked by a covered walkway to [[The Star Gold Coast]]. Managed by the [[Star Entertainment Group]], the Centre caters for 10 to 6,000 people.&lt;ref name="gca"&gt;Gold Coast Australia. [http://www.goldcoastaustralia.com/gccec.html?searched=GCCEC&amp;advsearch=oneword&amp;highlight=ajaxSearch_highlight+ajaxSearch_highlight1 "Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre"] Retrieved 21 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre has [[Business conference|conference]] facilities for up to 6,000 [[delegate]]s and 10,000&amp;nbsp;sqm of exhibition space. The property features a main arena, four halls, 22 meeting rooms, four registration offices and 12 kitchens for catering.&lt;ref name="gcc"/&gt; The Centre is located {{convert|18.3|km|mi}} from Coolangatta airport.&lt;ref name="gca"/&gt; The facility has wireless internet access.&lt;ref&gt;Gold Coast Tourism. [http://www.visitgoldcoast.com/broadbeach/attractions/gold-coast-convention-and-exhibition-centre/ "Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre"] Retrieved 21 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
The Centre was expanded at a cost of $40 million in early 2009. The makeover was funded by the Queensland Government, adding two extra exhibition halls, a registration office, three meeting rooms and three new kitchens and an extra 3,000 square metres of floor space in total. The Queensland Government commenced construction proceedings as a result of the increasing demand on the Gold Coast for larger space and concurrent sessions during national and international conventions and incentives. The final product required
over 124,000 man hours, 1550 m3 of concrete poured, 375 tonnes of structural steel erected and 7,000 litres of paint.

==Events==
The GCCEC is home to numerous conventions, from the association, corporate and franchise sectors to consumer shows and entertainment events.

From the [[2007-08 NBL season]] until the end of the [[2011-12 NBL season|2011-12 season]], the venue was home to the [[Gold Coast Blaze]] of the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] with the capacity to seat 5,269 spectators. During Blaze home games the Centre was referred to as "The Furnace" and gained a reputation for having close games with three Blaze games during the [[2010-11 NBL season]] going into [[Overtime (sports)#Basketball|overtime]]. Along with the [[Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre]], the [[Queensland Firebirds]], a Brisbane-based netball team in the [[Suncorp Super Netball]] play regular home games at the venue.

In 2007 the [[Professional Bull Riders]] (PBR) hosted its first-ever World Cup event at the GCCEC, pitting 5 nations of bull riders against each other in a team format; the event was won by team [[Brazil]].

In 2012, GCCEC played host to the Gold Coast judges' audition in the third series of [[Seven Network]]'s [[The X Factor (Australian TV series)|The X Factor]] and the [[UFC on FX: Sotiropoulos vs. Pearson]] bout - the first of its kind to be held in [[Queensland]].

The Centre is set to host the [[Netball at the Commonwealth Games|Netball competition]] at the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]] which are being held on the Gold Coast, as well as host the accredited media centre for the event.

In 2019, it will be the venue to host the Eurovision 2019 Australia Decides contest, the first venue for the contest.

'''David F. Hoy Field''', usually referred to simply as '''Hoy Field''', is a baseball field at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], [[New York (state)|New York]], where the [[Cornell Big Red|Big Red]]'s baseball team plays.

==History==
The field was named after distinguished alumnus and Kappa Sigma brother David "Davy" Hoy, of which the "Davy" from Cornell's [[fight song]], [[Give My Regards to Davy]] makes reference to. Hoy also served many years as the university's registrar and was involved in the baseball program.&lt;ref name="Penner2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard H. Penner|title=Cornell University|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yo93YB_mwcEC&amp;pg=PA58|year=2013|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-9796-6|pages=58–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It opened in 1922 &lt;!-- Official Big Red site claims 1922 and gives date for first gamehttp://cornellbigred.collegesports.com/facilities/hoy.html; Cornell Chronicle has said 1921 http://www.news.cornell.edu/Chronicle/04/5.27.04/U.S.prez_visits.html --&gt; and has batting facilities that are dedicated in memory of Kerry Brooks, a 1990 graduate of Cornell and a former "Big Red" co-captain.

Hoy Field is located just west of [[Schoellkopf Field]] and east of the [[Cornell University College of Engineering|Engineering Quad]] on the southern end of Cornell's campus.  The dimensions of the field from [[home plate]] to the [[outfield]] fence are 315 feet in left field, 405 feet in center field and 325 feet in right field.&lt;ref name="facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Cornell Baseball Quick Facts|url=http://www.cornellbigred.com/sports/2010/8/12/BB_0812104740.aspx?path=baseball|publisher=Cornell University Athletics|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The seating capacity of Hoy Field is about 500.  For many years the Bacon Cage, an indoor batting practice facility that was also used as an indoor golf driving range, was located between Schoellkopf Field and Hoy Field.  However, Bacon Cage was demolished to build a parking garage and new press box on the west side of Schoellkopf Field.

In 1947 it was proposed that the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations|School of Industrial and Labor Relations]] be housed in a new building that would be built partly over the field, but protests from students and alumni blocked the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Cornell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jUu9pDRhWjkC&amp;pg=PA569|date=31 October 1962|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-0036-8|pages=569–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the grass turf was removed and replaced with [[FieldTurf]], which has many grass-like properties.  In 2012, the field hosted the [[2012 Ivy League Baseball Championship Series]], in which Cornell defeated [[Dartmouth Big Green baseball|Dartmouth]] two games to one.&lt;ref name=2012ivychampseries&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleischman|first=Tom|title=Cruz Blasts His Way into Cornell Lore|url=http://www.theithacajournal.com/article/20120508/SPORTS/205080381/Cruz-blasts-his-way-into-Cornell-lore?odyssey=nav%7Chead|work=TheIthacaJournal.com|accessdate=26 May 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67xN6gDj6|archivedate=2012-05-26|date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jenga''' is a [[Game of skill|game of physical skill]] created by [[Leslie Scott (game designer)|Leslie Scott]], and currently marketed by [[Hasbro]]. Players take turns removing one block at a time from a tower constructed of 54 blocks. Each block removed is then placed on top of the tower, creating a progressively taller and more unstable structure.

The name ''jenga'' is derived from ''kujenga'', a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word which means "to build".&lt;ref name="strong"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.strongmuseum.org/blogs/?p=78 |title=Strong National Museum of Play |publisher=Strongmuseum.org |date=2009-01-20 |accessdate=2010-05-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807140452/http://www.museumofplay.org/blog/play-stuff/2009/01/jenga-jenga-jenga/ |archivedate=2011-08-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Jenga is played with 54 wooden blocks. Each block is three times longer than its width, and one fifth as thick as its length {{convert|1.5|x|2.5|x|7.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Blocks have small, random variations from these dimensions so as to create imperfections in the stacking process and provide additional challenge to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510303/how-to-do-everything# |title=Sheep, Spiders, and Jenga |website=How To Do Everything |publisher=[[NPR]] |host=Mike Danforth &amp; Ian Chillag |date=August 14, 2015 |access-date=February 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To set up the game, the included loading tray is used to stack the initial tower which has eighteen levels of three blocks placed adjacent to one another along their long side and at right angles to the previous level (so, for example, if the blocks in the first level lie lengthwise north-south, the second-level blocks will lie east-west). 

Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower gets the first move. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any level (except the one below the incomplete top level) of the tower, and placing it on the topmost level to complete it. Only one hand should be used at a time when taking blocks from the tower. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place must be returned to its original location before removing another block. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower or after ten seconds, whichever occurs first.

The game ends when the tower falls, or if any piece falls from the tower other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The winner is the last person to successfully remove and place a block.

==Origins==
Jenga was created by Leslie Scott,&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Origins of Timeless Toys'', 244&lt;/ref&gt; the co-founder of [[Oxford Games|Oxford Games Ltd]], based on a game that evolved within her family in the early 1970s using children's wooden building blocks&lt;ref name="strong"/&gt; the family purchased from a sawmill in [[Takoradi]], Ghana. A [[British national]], Scott was born in [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]], where she was raised speaking English and Swahili, before moving to live in Ghana, West Africa. Scott launched the game she named and trademarked as "Jenga" at the London Toy Fair in January 1983&lt;ref name="aboutjenga"&gt;About Jenga: The Remarkable Business of Creating a Game that Became a Household Name. Leslie Scott ([[Greenleaf Book Group]] Press)[http://www.aboutjenga.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and sold it through her own company, Leslie Scott Associates. The blocks of the first sets of Jenga were manufactured for Scott by the [[Camphill Village Trust]] in [[Botton, North Yorkshire|Botton]], Yorkshire. The [[V&amp;A Museum of Childhood]] has exhibited one of the original sets of Jenga since 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/things-to-do/blogs/british-toy-making-blog/personal-view-leslie-scott-inventor-jenga |title=A personal view from Leslie Scott, the inventor of Jenga &amp;#124; Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306051211/http://www.vam.ac.uk/things-to-do/blogs/british-toy-making-blog/personal-view-leslie-scott-inventor-jenga |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Robert Grebler, an entrepreneur from California who was the brother of a close friend of Scott, contacted her and expressed interest in importing and distributing Jenga in Canada. In April 1985, Grebler acquired from Scott the exclusive rights to Jenga for the United States and Canada, and then in October of that year, Scott assigned the worldwide rights in Jenga to Grebler,&lt;ref&gt;About Jenga, 108&lt;/ref&gt; which he in turn assigned to Pokonobe Associates. Convinced of Jenga's potential, Grebler had invited two cousins to form Pokonobe Associates with him in 1985 to increase distribution of Jenga.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Origins of Timeless Toys'', 247&lt;/ref&gt; Pokonobe then licensed Irwin Toy to sell Jenga in Canada and to be master licensee worldwide. Irwin Toy licensed Jenga to Schaper in the United States and when that company was bought by Hasbro, Jenga was launched under the Milton Bradley banner in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Origins of Timeless Toys'', 248&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Hasbro became licensee in most countries around the world.

As of late 2017, according to Pokonobe Associates, owners of the Jenga brand, over 80 million Jenga games, equivalent to more than 4.3 billion Jenga blocks, have been sold worldwide.

==Tallest tower==
[[File:Jenga distorted.jpg|thumb|A jenga tower]]
[[File:Jenga.gif|thumb|Here, the Jenga tower collapses as a result of a block being pulled from the tower.]]
The packaging copy of one edition of the Jenga game claims that Robert Grebler may have built the tallest Jenga tower ever at 40{{fraction|2|3}} levels. Grebler built the tower in 1985 while playing with an original Jenga set produced by Leslie Scott in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Marketing copy on inside lid of the 2008 ''Vintage Game Collection'' edition of Jenga marketed by Hasbro&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official variants==
Throw 'n Go Jenga is a variant originally marketed by Hasbro. It consists of blocks that are various colors plus a six-sided die. It is currently marketed by Art's Ideas.

[[Image:Jenga Truth Or Dare.JPG|right|thumb|260px|Jenga Truth or Dare tower]]
Jenga [[Truth or Dare]] was an adult variation of Jenga also marketed by Hasbro. This version looked like regular Jenga except there were three colors of blocks instead of just the natural color of Jenga. 

Jenga Xtreme used [[parallelogram]]-shaped blocks that could create some interesting leaning towers.

Casino Jenga: Las Vegas Edition employed [[roulette]]-style game play, featuring a felt game board, betting chips, and additional rules.

In addition, there have been a number of collector edition Jenga games, featuring the colors and logos of the [[Boston Red Sox]], [[Oakland Raiders]], [[New York Yankees]], and [[Deere &amp; Company|John Deere]], among others. [[Hello Kitty]] Jenga, [[Transformers]] Jenga, [[Tarzan]] Jenga, [[Tim Burton]]'s [[The Nightmare Before Christmas]] Jenga, [[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]] Jenga, [[Bob's Burgers]] Jenga, National Parks Jenga, Jenga Ocean, and [[The Walking Dead (franchise)|Walking Dead]] Jenga are some of the licensed variations of Jenga.

Jenga XXL and Jenga Giant are licensed giant Jenga games manufactured and distributed by Art's Ideas. There are Jenga Giant variations which can reach {{convert|5|ft|cm|-1}} or higher in play. Jenga XXL starts at over {{convert|4|ft}} high and can reach {{convert|8|ft}} or higher in play. Rules are the same as in classic Jenga, except players can use two hands to move the eighteen-inch-long blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jenga.us.com |title=Jenga |publisher=Jenga.us.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenga Pass Challenge includes a handheld platform that the game is played on. Players remove a block while holding the platform, then pass the platform to the next player. This variant includes only half the number of blocks, 27, which means the tower starts at nine levels high instead of eighteen.

==Video games==
''[[Jenga World Tour]]'' for Nintendo [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS|DS]] was released by [[Atari]] on December 7, 2007. A version of the Jenga game for the Nintendo Wii from [[Electronic Arts]] was part of [[Hasbro]]'s ''Family Game Night 2'' offering.

An [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] version exists, released in late 2010 by [[NaturalMotion Games]]. NaturalMotion has also released versions for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phones and Mac computers.

'''''Michel Vaillant''''' is a 2003 [[France|French]] movie starring [[Sagamore Stévenin]] and [[Diane Kruger]]. It depicts events around the [[24 hours of Le Mans]] race, based largely on a comic about the [[Michel Vaillant]] character.

The racing sequences were shot during the [[2002 24 Hours of Le Mans|2002 race]].

==Plot==
For decades, the Vaillant family has been successfully involved in various kinds of motor racing competitions. Their most notorious driver is Michel, the son of the team's founder and owner Henri and younger brother of Jean-Pierre, the team's manager. One night, Michel's mother Elizabeth has a nightmare involving his death in an accident at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], racing against a car bearing the number 13 from Leader, a team with which the Vaillants had a historic rivalry for more than a quarter of a century. Henri conforts her, assuring that they are not planning to race at Le Mans, that Leader has been out of competition for 5 years and that no one has ever used the number 13 at the race. Meanwhile, in [[Canada]], Michel and his best friend and teammate Steve Warson are both competing in [[World Rally Championship|WRC]] cars. Michel's victory spikes the wrath of Bob Cramer, a ruthless competing driver who is blocked by Vaillant's cars during the race. Cramer ends up threatening Michel's co-pilot, David. A few days later, Henri announces that Vaillant will have an engine at time for Le Mans, and promotes David to the driver's seat at the Rally of Italy, promising him a seat at Michel's car in the 24 hour race if he does well. In Italy, Cramer forces David out of the road, causing him to crash. David is caught in the car's explosion and dies. At the funeral, Michel meets Julie Wood, David's wife. She asks him for his husband's place at Le Mans, and Michel convinces his brother to let her on the team. Meanwhile, the Leader team returns to the competition, by the hand of Ruth, Leader's daughter. They announce that they will race at Le Mans with the number 13, hiring Bob Cramer as one of the drivers. Élisabeth worries that her nightmare can become a reality and tries to dissuade Henri from competing, but he refuses to do so. The weekend at Le Mans starts, and Ruth is determined to stop Vaillant from winning, so she sabotages the car delivery. The Vaillants barely make it on time to compete. This doesn't stop Ruth, and she kidnaps Henri, threatening to kill him if his team wins. Michel initially complies, losing a lot of time each lap. He finally tells Jean-Pierre about Ruth's plan and decides to go and save his father, asking Julie to pose as him during the race. Michel tracks his father's location through the GPS in Ruth's car, but she finds him. Michel is forced by Ruth to drive the Leader, posing as Bob Cramer after an accident puts him out of competition. Ruth and Michel find each other on the track and end up colliding violently, just like in Élisabeth's nightmare. Even though the crash was horrific, they both come out of the wreckage unharmed, and Michel goes with Steve and Julie to rescue Henri from Ruth's henchmen, who start shooting as they flee and injure Steve. The race ends with Steve's Vaillant crossing the line with a flat tire, inches before Leader's car, which had an engine failure and is being pushed by its driver. Unbeknownst to everyone, Michel was posing as Steve in the final laps. They all celebrate yet another Vaillant victory, while Ruth stares blankly in defeat.

== Production ==
The film was partly shot during the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] race in June 2002. Event organizers added two cars to the field specifically to accommodate the filming but the production had to hire 6 professional drivers to drive the cars during the actual race.

== Reception ==
The film was poorly received by critics, who felt it didn't honor the widely successful comics in which it was based on, underdeveloping the main characters and favoring a styilized and advert-like look. However, some of them praised its photography and exciting racing scenes. Despite a strong marketing campaign, it failed to reach 1 million viewers in France.

The '''Montana State Fairgrounds Racetrack''', also known as the '''Lewis and Clark County Fairgrounds Racetrack''' and as '''Helena Downs''', is a historic [[horse racing]] [[Race track|track]] located on the outskirts of [[Helena, Montana]], in the United States. Constructed in 1870, the track was part of the Montana State Fairgrounds, now the Lewis and Clark County Fairgrounds. The racetrack was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on December 20, 2006. Portions of the track were demolished from 2006 to 2008 due to new construction on the fairgrounds.

Semi-formal local horse [[flat racing]] meets first occurred in Montana in [[Deer Lodge, Montana|Deer Lodge]], Helena, and [[Virginia City, Montana|Virginia City]] in the 1860s. Helena's first permanent horse racing track was Madam Coady's Two-Mile House,{{Efn|The exact location of Madam Coady's, and the racetrack, is not known.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=18 fn2}}&lt;ref name=asshewas /&gt;}} a {{convert|1|mi|km}} track located a few miles from Helena. The first Montana Territorial Fair was held at the site 1868, and included Montana's first regionally-organized horse flat race. [[Harness racing]] was added at the second Territorial Fair in 1869.&lt;ref name=baumler&gt;{{cite news|last=Baumler|first=Ellen|title=Montana's Horse-Racing History Runs Deep|work=The Independent Record|date=April 16, 2006|accessdate=May 14, 2017|url=http://helenair.com/lifestyles/montana-s-horse-racing-history-runs-deep/article_c38772f9-f0b5-5fa4-8561-98fc11a535e5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Montana State Fairgrounds track==
===Construction of the track===
In August 1870,&lt;ref name=baumler /&gt; a group of Helena businessmen and civic leaders organized a new association, the Montana Agricultural Mineral and Mechanical Association, to host a new regional fair.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=3}} Among the trustees of the new organization were such prominent Montanans as Daniel A. G. Floweree, Cornelius Hedges, Anton M. Holter, and [[Conrad Kohrs]]. The group purchased property outside Helena (at the current location of the Montana State Fairgrounds), and construction of the racetrack began immediately. The {{convert|1|mi|km}} track was built according to the rules of the [[American Horse Congress]] and the California State Agricultural Society, had a {{convert|0.25|mi|km|adj=on}} home stretch, and was wide enough to accommodate eight [[Sulky|sulkies]].&lt;ref name=baumler /&gt; It is unclear if the track was a regular oval or if it had slightly distorted third and fourth turns which gave it an irregular oblong shape.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|pages=18-19, fn 18}}{{Efn|All existing map and photographic evidence indicates the home stretch, as constructed in 1870, remained in place as of 2003.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|pages=18-19, fn 18}}}} At the time of its construction, it was the only regulation {{convert|1|mi|km}} track in the territory.&lt;ref name=baumler /&gt;

Several other buildings were erected about the same time as the track was constructed. Grandstands were constructed probably at the same as the track,{{Efn|The date of construction is unclear, but 1870 is the likeliest date. They were definitely in place no later than 1887.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=39}}}} beginning near the starting line and extending eastward.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=39}} A "[[paddock]]" was built to the east of the grandstand, and around the first turn were three [[stable]]s.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|pages=52-53}}{{Efn|The date of construction for the stables is unclear. They were definitely in place by 1887.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=52}} The nature of the "paddock" is unclear. The term denotes an enclosed by unroofed space for the temporary holding of animals, but there is some evidence that the "paddock" was a roofed building even in its earliest days. There is strong evidence that the "paddock" was roofed (and thus more like a stable or barn) by 1892, and probably rebuilt as a stable or barn in 1903 or 1904.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|pages=15, 52-53}}}}

===Early history of the track===
Races were held throughout the summer (not just at fair-time).{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=5}} They attracted horses from as far away as [[Salt Lake City]], and even included some high-quality [[Kentucky]] [[thoroughbred]]s. By 1884, horse racing tracks had been built in [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]] and [[Butte, Montana|Butte]], and a "Montana Circuit" for horse racing had evolved. Races at Montana Circuit tracks became more exclusive, and applicant horses had to be vetted by a nomination committee before being allowed to race.&lt;ref name=baumler /&gt; The Montana Circuit eventually expanded to 15 regulation tracks.&lt;ref name=tyron&gt;{{cite news|last=Tryon|first=Phyllis|title=Horse Racing Task Force gets financial support from industry|work=The Racing Journal|date=August 10, 2006|accessdate=May 14, 2017|url=http://www.theracingjournal.com/news/article.php?article_id=751}}&lt;/ref&gt; On either side of the finish line were judging stands. These are two-storied structures which gave judging officials a clear view of the finish line so that they might declare which horses won and placed in the race. Initially, these were merely covered platforms, but they were replaced several times over the years with more elaborate, permanent structures with walls, windows, and amenities.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=44}}

Montana became a [[U.S. state]] in 1889,&lt;ref name=baumler /&gt; and the fair was renamed the Montana State Fair in 1891 after being sold to a new group of investors.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=5}} Helena horse racing continued to gain in prestige, with owners in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], and [[Spokane, Washington]], sending entries. The track was rebuilt that year.&lt;ref name=baumler /&gt;{{Efn|If the 1870 track were oblong, it is most likely it was corrected to a true oval at this time.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|pages=18-19, fn 18}}}} A [[Montana Central Railway]] [[Branch line|spur]] reached the fairgrounds that same year, and local undocumented tradition claimed that several [[railroad car]]s of earth from Kentucky were laid on the track.&lt;ref name=baumler /&gt;

The [[Panic of 1893]] created significant economic disruption in Montana, and the Montana State Fair shut down after the 1895 event. The fairgrounds were mortgaged, and the issuers of the loan foreclosed.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=5}}

===Period of state ownership===
Helena residents raised money in 1903 to buy the fairgrounds, which were donated to the state.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=5}} By this time, the track had so deteriorated that large amounts of soil had to be trucked in to restore the turns.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=57}} The state of Montana authorized a subsidized Montana State Fair in 1903, and in 1904 [[relay race]]s were added.&lt;ref name=baumler /&gt; About this time, a two-story raised platform was erected just outside the first turn. This platform was used by racing officials to direct animals and riders before and after races.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=52}} In 1904, the three stables were moved from the first turn to outside the far stretch and rebuilt as [[speed barn]]s. A fourth speed barn and three more stables were built at some point thereafter.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|pages=50, 53}}{{Efn|There is some evidence that indicates the three new stables were built in 1904.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=51}}}} Two small [[cottage]]s were erected about this time as well. One was against the north fence between the speed barns and stables, and another was at the end of a long shed built east of the speed barns. The cottage attached to the shed was used by the racetrack veterinarian.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=51}}

Significant changes to the viewing area were made after 1904. Three sets of [[bleachers]] were erected at the racetrack between 1903 and 1914. The first (the "long bleachers") was erected about {{convert|700|ft|m}} west of the grandstands, probably in 1904. The second set was erected between 1904 and 1913 to the west of the grandstand, and the third (the "small bleachers") to the west of the long bleachers, probably in 1914.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=32}} The old grandstands were demolished in 1906, and replaced with larger ones. Roughly {{convert|260|ft|m}} long and {{convert|60|ft|m}} wide, they cost $20,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|20000|1906}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) and were capable of seating 5,000 people.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=39}} Beneath the grandstands were a small jockey's dressing room (eastern end), a [[restaurant]], and a room with betting windows.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=40}}

The horse racing at the Montana State Fair began to decline after the [[Montana Legislature]] banned [[gambling|betting]] on horse races in 1914.  The fair's financial situation deteriorated when the state legislature significantly cut the subsidy in 1915, and a worsening decade-long [[drought]] led to fewer paying exhibitors.&lt;ref name=baumler /&gt; A {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} dirt automobile racing track was built in the horse racing track's infield in 1916, nestled against the first turn.&lt;ref name=asshewas&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fairgrounds: Home of the Montana Territorial and State Fairs 1870-1932|website=Helena As She Was|date=March 11, 2017|accessdate=May 14, 2017|url=http://www.helenahistory.org/the_fairgrounds.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although horse racing remained popular at the fairgrounds,&lt;ref name=baumler /&gt; economic difficulties led to the fair's cancellation in 1926. Organizers managed to host only small fairs 1927 to 1932.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=7}}

The ban on gambling was lifted in 1930. That year, more than 350 high-quality racehorses from the U.S., [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]] raced at Helena, and [[parimutuel betting]] (assisted by an [[Tote board|automatic totaliser]]) first occurred.&lt;ref name=baumler /&gt; The "paddock" was abandoned the same year, and a true, open-air paddock was built next to it.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|pages=53}}

===Closure and reopening===
The last Montana State Fair was held in Helena in 1932.&lt;ref name=baumler /&gt; The [[1935 Helena earthquake]] and several fires in the 1930s and 1940s destroyed several unspecified structures associated with the horse racing track.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=8}} In the fall of 1937, the three north stables and veterinarian's cottage burned down. Horse racing ended during this time, and the track was abandoned except for the small section in front of the grandstand (used as part of the automobile race track).{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=9}}

The largest of the four north barns was relocated to nearby Green Meadow Ranch about 1938.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|pages=20, 51}} The remaining three north barns either burned down or were demolished by 1951.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=51}} Both finish-line judging stands were removed by then as well.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=44}}

In mid-1953, the Capital City Racing Association constructed a {{convert|0.25|mi|km}} oval [[Stock car racing|stock car]] racing track inside the 1916 automobile track. It remained in until 1956.&lt;ref name=asshewas&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fairgrounds: Home of the Montana Territorial and State Fairs 1870-1932|website=Helena As She Was|date=March 11, 2017|accessdate=May 14, 2017|url=http://www.helenahistory.org/the_fairgrounds.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horse racing returned to the horse track in 1961 after organizers hosted the first [[Last Chance Stampede]] at the old fairgrounds.&lt;ref name=baumler /&gt; Some newspapers began referring to the horse track as "Helena Downs" at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Early|first=Dave|title=Horsemen Not Happy With Racing Secretary|work=The Independent Record|date=July 7, 1970|page=7|accessdate=May 15, 2017|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/35806018/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horse racing lasted until 1998,&lt;ref name=tyron /&gt; and a year later the state turned the fairgrounds over to Lewis and Clark County.&lt;ref name=klinecleared&gt;{{cite news|last=Kline|first=Larry|title=County cleared in lawsuit|work=The Independent Record|date=March 19, 2008|accessdate=May 14, 2017|url=http://helenair.com/news/local/county-cleared-in-lawsuit/article_70ebbec0-bc2d-5e57-a700-747b1a1c2441.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===County ownership and changes to the track===
The grandstands were demolished in 2000.&lt;ref name=asshewas /&gt; They had fallen into a decrepit state, and preservationists vigorously asked for them to be preserved. But the cost was too great, and the state declined to assume the cost.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=10}} New modern, metal bleachers were erected in their place, and in the infield just west of the first turn. The new grandstands, designed to accommodate [[rodeo]] activities in the infield, occupied about one-eighth of the horse racing track surface.&lt;ref name=asshewas /&gt; Both the second turn, home stretch, and backstretch were bulldozed to accommodate rodeo activities.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=14}}

The public discussion over the grandstands led the Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Office to conduct a historic assessment of the Montana State Fairgrounds in 2003.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=1}}

In 2005, the Lewis and Clark County Fair Board began consideration of a plan to reconfigured the old Montana State Fairgrounds for reuse.&lt;ref name=support /&gt; The plans called for a new grandstand and a large new exhibition building in the horse track infield, and demolition of the home stretch.&lt;ref name=klinewhoa&gt;{{cite news|last=Kline|first=Larry|title=Whoa there: Preservation group seeks halt to fairgrounds work|work=The Independent Record|date=August 31, 2006|accessdate=May 14, 2017|url=http://helenair.com/news/local/whoa-there-preservation-group-seeks-halt-to-fairgrounds-work/article_9aa392ec-38a0-56ac-b13d-9e26848074c0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was support for the return of horse racing and restoration of the track, the fair board declined to amend the plan to accommodate it.&lt;ref name=support&gt;{{cite news|title=Horsemen's support needed in response to draft plan for Helena fairgrounds|work=The Racing Journal|date=May 6, 2005|accessdate=May 14, 2017|url=http://www.theracingjournal.com/news/article.php?article_id=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the county began building an access road across the horse racing track in the fall of 2005 in preparation for construction, an organization named Save the Track Foundation unsuccessfully sued to have the road stopped.&lt;ref name=klinewhoa /&gt;

In November 2006, Lewis and Clark County voters approved a $5.7 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5700000|2006|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) tax levy to implement the changes proposed by the fair board.&lt;ref name=klinewhoa /&gt; 

Despite the partial blockage and demolition of the track, the horse racing track (but not any associated buildings) was added to the National Register of Historic Places in December 2006.&lt;ref name=nris /&gt;

In 2006, the Save the Track Foundation filed several lawsuits to enjoin Lewis and Clark County from implementing its reconfiguration of the fairgrounds. The group claimed that the fair board had misled voters by failing to disclose that the horse racing track would be partially demolished and the infield used for construction. County officials said the reconfiguration plan saved most of the track for horse racing and preservation purposes, and that a lengthy planning process determined that partial demolition and use of the infield was the best use of the land given current and future needs.&lt;ref name=klinewhoa /&gt; A [[Montana District Courts|Montana District Court]] judge declined to issue a temporary injunction halting the plan, and in March 2008 issued a formal ruling in favor of the county. The ruling allowed final construction on the new {{convert|60000|sqft|m2}} exhibition building to go forward.&lt;ref name=klinecleared /&gt;

==About the track==
The Montana State Fairgrounds Racetrack is located in the center of the {{convert|160|acre|m2|adj=on}} fairgrounds.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=3}}

Grandstands, three sets of bleachers, an enclosed "paddock", two judging platforms, and three stables were built during the track's early history on the home stretch and first turn.  Speed barns, three stables, and two cottages were built adjacent to the back stretch in the first two or three decades of the 20th century. No historic structures associated with the track's history remained as of 2006.{{sfn|Helena/Lewis and Clark County Historic Preservation Commission|2003|page=15}}

The Montana State Fairgrounds Racetrack was one of only three {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} tracks west of the [[Mississippi River]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=tyron /&gt; It was reported to be the oldest of these
{{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} tracks in 2006,&lt;ref name=baumler /&gt; as well as the oldest extant horse racing track in Montana, and the only racing track built in Montana's territorial period to survive into the 21st century.&lt;ref name=baumler /&gt; According to the ''[[American Racing Manual]]'', it was the second oldest horse racing track of its kind in the nation.&lt;ref name=klinewhoa /&gt;

[[File:Paper Football.png|thumb|Children playing a game of paper football]]
'''Paper football''' (also called '''FIKI football''', '''finger football''', '''flick football''', or '''tabletop football''') refers to a [[table (furniture)|table]]-top [[game]], loosely based on [[American football]], in which a sheet of [[paper]] folded into a small triangle is slid back and forth across a table top by two opponents. This game is widely practiced for entertainment, mostly by students in [[primary school|primary]], [[middle school]], and [[high school]] age in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Wulf2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wulf|first=Steve|title=ESPN: The Mighty Book of Sports Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn-X4YCCAVYC&amp;pg=PA164|date=June 9, 2009|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=9780345511775|pages=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football construction==
Due to the audience and impromptu nature of the game, a paper football is often made out of a single sheet of paper.  The paper is folded similar to [[Flag_of_the_United_States#Folding_for_storage|the way that an American flag is folded to form a triangle]].  First the paper is folded lengthwise two or three times to form a long rectangle. Then it is repeatedly folded in a diagonal fashion, forming a triangle.  Finally, the end of the strip is tucked into the last fold, securing the final paper football in a triangular shape. 

In the absence of paper, sugar packets, matchbooks, and foil-wrapped cookies have also been used to substitute for a ball.

==Game play==
Many variations of the game exist, but generally paper football games vaguely emulate American football. The two opposing teams (usually two opposing players) sit facing each other over the play area. A coin (or, a specially-marked football) is flipped to see who kicks off to start the game. After the kickoff the teams advance the Ball by flicking it across the field. Each flick represents a drive in American football, with the goal being to score a touchdown. Games may be as simple as flicking the ball back and forth in a fashion similar to ''field goals,'' or as involved as including simulations of events from ''touchbacks'' to ''penalties'' to ''first downs''.

===Kick off===
A kick off may start the game. The player holds the football under a fingertip of one hand on his end of the table and flicks (kicks) it with a finger from the other hand towards the opposing player's end of the table. The receiving team gets possession where the ball stops.  If any part of the ball is overhanging the end of the table a [[touchback]] has occurred. The receiving team gets an agreed distance away from their endzone and play continues.

There are a couple of other ways to perform the kick off; one is by placing the ball on the edge of the table with one corner overhanging, and flicking it towards the opposing side of the table. Other players use a one-handed type of kick off: the ball is held resting in the palm, then it is tossed onto the table by hitting the fingers on the underside of the table. The method used should be agreed upon before playing.

Some play with a "wind" rule on kickoffs in which the opposing player can blow the ball backwards as "wind."

===Advancing the ball===
The primary activity of the game is to slide the paper football across the football field by flicking it. The legal flick or shot or throw is any method which advances the ball through flicking or hitting, but pushing the ball is disallowed. The ball is generally flicked either with the thumb and forefinger in a manner similar to shooting [[marbles]], or another manner comfortable to the player. Striking with objects such as pencils is more rare.

Players have four chances (downs) to score a touchdown. They may attempt a field goal on fourth down.

===Scoring===
A team scores points by the following plays:

====Touchdown====
A touchdown (TD) is worth 6 points, as in [[American football#Scoring|American football]]. A touchdown is scored when a player advances the ball such that it comes to rest with part of the ball extending over the edge the opponent's end of the table without falling to the ground. If the ball falls to the ground it is considered a touchback. If on fourth down a player feels that they are not close enough to have a good chance at scoring a touchdown then they can attempt a field goal for 3.

When the players are unsure whether a touchdown has been scored, a flat object can be slid across the edge of the table nearest the ball. If the object moves the ball, a touchdown is ruled.

====Extra points====
Following a ''touchdown'', the scoring player usually kicks a field goal for 1 point (an ''extra point'' or ''point-after touchdown''), or has the option to try for 2 points (a ''two-point conversion'').
* '''Point After Touchdown''': The opponent holds his fingers in the [[goalpost]] position, and the scoring player flicks the ball through the air. The attempt is successful so long as the center of the ball travels through the imaginary area over the bottom fingers and between the ''uprights'', even if the ball bounces off the uprights (but continues through the scoring area) in the process.
* '''Two Point Conversion''': The scoring player gets one attempt to flick the ball over the edge of the table in a manner similar to scoring a touchdown. The player starts from the middle of the table for this attempt.
Play resumes with either a fresh kickoff by the scoring player, or a change of possession, based on house rules.

====Field goals====
A [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] is any attempt by a player to hold the ball in one hand (which in turn generally rests on the table), and to flick the ball using the other hand such that it travels through a [[goalpost]] formed by the fingers of the opposing player. Field goals generally score 3 points. Implementation of ''field goals'' varies widely, and in some variations the game consists entirely of players kicking ''field goals'' back and forth with no other plays in between. If this is the case, each successful field goal is worth only one point.

Variations:
* If a team gains possession in the other teams territory (such as after an illegal attempt to push the ball or the ball going [[Paper football#Out of Bounds|out of bounds]]), the player can attempt a '''[[Field goal (football)|field goal]]''' instead of trying for a touchdown.  The defender can place the goal posts anywhere on their goal line and the kick must take place from the exact position where the football lies, or from the spot the football left the table.
* The defending player has the option to try for a field goal after a touchback. A field goal, which employs precisely the same method as described above for a Point After Touchdown, except that it scores three points rather than one. In some variations, the field goal option is only awarded after three (or another predetermined number of) touchbacks.
[[File:Goalpost.jpg|thumb|A defender demonstrates a finger goalpost.]]

====Safety====
A [[Safety (American football score)|safety]] is worth two points. This occurs when a player scores a touchdown on his/her own end of the table and not his/her opponent's end. The opposing player earns these two points.

====Penalties====
Pushing the ball excessively, double flicking, kicking the ball so that it lands far away from the table, or disturbing the ball during an opponent's play may all result in penalties depending on game variation. Most often, a penalty moves the ball toward the offender's side of the table, to the opponent's advantage. If players are using ''downs'', the offending player generally loses a down (or the opponent's play is considered not to have used a down), in addition to letting the opposing player move the ball to a more advantageous position.

==Game length==
Game length varies. A match may last a set amount of time such as 10 points or until the end of a class period in school. A match is often played until someone attains 21 points.  Games are generally played quite quickly, especially when played on shorter tables.

Various methods in turn or in combination can be used to break ties. One is "sudden death" - if the game is tied in a timed game, the match goes into sudden death, and the player who scores first wins the game.

==Variations==
* The game was known to be played with matchbooks as footballs in the 1950s in the American Midwest.
* Players are allowed only one chance to advance the ball over the goal line per turn (instead of the aforementioned four tries). If a player pushes the ball off of their opponent's end of the table a "strike" is awarded and their opponent gets to kick the ball back into play. After 3 strikes a player's opponent has the option of kicking a field goal for 3 points.
* Tabletop football was played in Connecticut in the 1950s using an American quarter. Each player had 4 downs to advance the quarter up the field, and hang it over the edge of the table for a touchdown. If the quarter fell off the edge or the player failed to hang it within 4 downs, the opponent was given possession. The shooting player could try a field goal at any time by hanging the quarter over his own edge of the table, and "kicking" it with his index finger toward the opponents field goal "posts." The player with the highest score won the opponent's quarter. Due to the excessive noise of the quarter during play, the quarter variation was often avoided in school. 
* As the length of the paper football and the length of the table vary, the probability of the football hanging off the edge varies.
* One classroom variation incorporates a study guide or test into the game. Each player in turn answers the next question on the quiz, and may only take possession of the ball with a correct answer, playing the ball from its current position on the table.

'''Peoples Natural Gas Field''' is a 7,210-seat baseball-only stadium in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]], that opened in 1999. It is the home [[ballpark]] of the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]]'s [[Altoona Curve]] [[Minor League Baseball]] team.

==History==
The groundbreaking ceremony for the stadium, then known as '''Blair County Ballpark''', was held on March 7, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Excav-AA-tion: 150 Area Residents Look on as Stadium Ground is Broken|first=Chad|last=Binette|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/pennsylvania/altoona/altoona-mirror/1998/03-08/|newspaper=[[Altoona Mirror]]|date=March 8, 1998|accessdate=May 26, 2014|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The addition of [[Major League Baseball]] teams in [[Arizona Diamondbacks|Phoenix, Arizona]], and [[Tampa Bay Rays|St. Petersburg, Florida]], in 1998 also created room for [[Minor League Baseball]] to expand.  Two additional teams were added to the Eastern League for the 1999 season:  the [[Altoona Curve]] and the [[Erie SeaWolves]].  The city of Altoona won the favor of the Eastern League over a bid from [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. The stadium hosted its first regular season baseball game on April 15, 1999, as the Curve defeated the [[Bowie Baysox]], 6–1.

From 1999 to 2002, total seating capacity was listed at 6,176. Prior to the 2003 season, an additional 1,034 seats were created with the construction of the new left-field reserved bleacher section, the third-base picnic pavilion, and the left-field party deck.&lt;ref name="media guide"/&gt;
Blair County Ballpark hosted the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] All-Star Game on July 12, 2006, before a record crowd of 9,308 fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Curve Eager to Host 2014 EL All-Star Game|first=Cory|last=Giger|url=http://www.altoonamirror.com/page/content.detail/id/573107/Curve-eager-to-host-2014-EL-All-Star-Game.html?nav=765|newspaper=[[Altoona Mirror]]|date=July 10, 2013|accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest regular-season crowd was 9,255, recorded on August 10, 2003, for a doubleheader against the [[Harrisburg Senators]].

On January 31, 2012, it was announced that Peoples Natural Gas had signed a naming-rights deal, making the new Peoples Natural Gas Field name official.  In addition, Peoples Natural Gas is conducting a study for on-site green energy.&lt;ref name="png"&gt;{{cite web |title=Curve, Peoples Natural Gas Forge Unique Agreement|url=http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120130&amp;content_id=26512706&amp;vkey=news_t452&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t452|publisher=Minor League Baseball|date=January 30, 2012|accessdate=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Peoples Natural Gas Field has a façade that resembles an old-fashioned railroad roundhouse that are prevalent throughout the city of Altoona.  The stadium is double-decked, with the Diamond Club seating section making up the lower level.  The main concourse with concessions and restrooms sits behind this section, and is covered by the upper levels of seating.

Peoples Natural Gas Field is unique because of its [[roller coaster]] located beyond the right-field wall.  This ride, called [[Skyliner (roller coaster)|Skyliner]], is actually part of the [[Lakemont Park]] amusement park located next door.  The ridges of the [[Allegheny Mountains]] can also be viewed from inside the stadium. Oddly enough, the MLB 2k13 minor league field labeled "AA East Field" is extremely similar to Peoples Natural Gas Field.

===Seating===
*Diamond club: 1,634 seats
*Terrace level: 1,204 seats
*Grandstand level: 2,646 seats
*Outfield reserved: 744 seats
*Third-base picnic pavilion: 250 seats
*"Rail Kings" (on party deck): 40 seats
*Skyboxes: 292 seats
*Bleachers: 400 seats&lt;ref name="media guide"/&gt;

The '''Phoenix Trotting Park''', was a [[horse racing]] track built in 1964 in [[Goodyear, Arizona|Goodyear]], [[Arizona]]. It opened in 1965 and was run for about two and a half seasons. The large, futuristically designed structure gave an optimistic look for the 1960s.

Originally planned to be built for a cost of about $3 million, the facility ended up costing around $10 million. One of the proprietors and visionaries behind the park was James Dunnigan, the renowned New York horseracing financier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phoenix Trotting Park in Goodyear|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/arts/phoenix-trotting-park-in-goodyear-6552624|publisher=Phoenix New Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various incentives during the events that were held, such as free parking and admission did initially lead to decent attendance, including an opening day showing of 12,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phoenix Trotting Park in Goodyear|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/arts/phoenix-trotting-park-in-goodyear-6552624|publisher=Phoenix New Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a variety of factors led to the inevitable closing of the track. The hot weather of the desert caused events to be uncomfortable to attendees. The location provided limited means to control rain, leading to floods that caused accessibility problems. The park is also located about 20 miles outside of Phoenix and was built long before any major roads made the area easily accessible to those in the city or its suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Goodyear Official Website|url=http://www.ci.goodyear.az.us/index.aspx?nid=2243|publisher=City of Goodyear|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531230607/http://www.ci.goodyear.az.us/index.aspx?NID=2243|archivedate=2013-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though closed in 1966, the 194-acre property had been continuously owned by either individuals or corporations/businesses.  And with the exception of a brief use for a movie, the property had sat abandoned since its closure.  As such, without any care, maintenance, or upkeep, the property showed its age.

The main building of the park was used in the 1998 [[Charlie Sheen|Charlie]]/[[Martin Sheen]] movie ''[[No Code of Conduct]]''. Part of the feature involved a large explosion occurring at the track.&lt;ref name="Gallen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallen|first1=Tim|title=Historic West Valley eyesore on the market for $16.5M in Goodyear|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2016/01/13/historic-phoenix-eyesore-on-the-market-for-16-5m.html#i1|accessdate=13 February 2016|work=Phoenix Business Journal|date=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, the property was put on the market for $16.5 million. The structure was demolished in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Van Sant|first1=Jeff|title=The old Phoenix Trotter Park set for demolition|url=http://www.azfamily.com/story/35457685/the-old-phoenix-trotter-park-set-for-demolition|accessdate=18 May 2017|work=azfamily.com|date=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/videos/news/local/southwest-valley/2017/09/27/phoenix-trotting-park-demolition-begins/106057844/  Phoenix Trotting Park demolition begins]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''roster bonus''' is a feature that may be included in a professional [[sports]] player [[contract]].

A roster bonus is conditional, unlike a [[signing bonus]].  The latter is received upon the initial signing of the contract and is generally the player's regardless of future events.  The roster bonus, however, is paid only if a player is still on the active roster of the team at a specific future date.  This feature is mostly used in [[North America]] in [[National Football League]] contracts.  Most NFL roster bonuses have trigger dates of either March 1 or June 1 of a specific future year.  If the player is on the team's roster as of that date, the entire amount of the bonus must be paid, even if he is released the next day.

The roster bonus has a very specific effect on a team's "[[salary cap]]," the amount of its payroll that counts toward the money permitted by league agreement.  The fact that it postpones much of the salary cap impact of a new player is one of the reasons it has become a popular contract feature, especially in the contract of highly compensated star players, but also as a way of recognizing and incentivizing mid- and lower-salaried players as well.

'''Santa Anita Park''' is a [[Thoroughbred]] [[racetrack]] in [[Arcadia, California]], [[United States]]. It offers some of the prominent horse racing events in the United States during the winter and in spring. With its backdrop of the [[San Gabriel Mountains]], it is considered by many the world's most beautiful race track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1076002/index.htm | work=CNN | title=The Most Beautiful Racetrack In The World | date=June 8, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track is home to numerous prestigious races including both the [[Santa Anita Derby]] and the [[Santa Anita Handicap]] as well as hosting the [[Breeders' Cup]] in 1986, 1993, 2003, 2008, 2009, and from 2012 to 2014, plus 2016. In 2010, Santa Anita's ownership was moved to MI Developments Inc. (MID).

==History==
Santa Anita Park was originally part of "[[Rancho Santa Anita]]," which was owned originally by former San Gabriel Mission Mayor-Domo, Claudio Lopez, and named after a family member, "Anita Cota." The ranch was later acquired by rancher [[Hugo Reid]], a [[Scottish people|Scotsman]]. Later, it was owned by multimillionaire horse breeder and racer [[Lucky Baldwin]]. Baldwin initially built a racetrack adjacent to the present site in what is today Arcadia, outside of the city of [[Los Angeles]], in 1904. It closed in 1909 and burned down in 1912.

In 1933, California legalized [[parimutuel]] wagering and several investor groups worked to open racetracks. In the [[San Francisco]] area, a group headed by [[Charles H. Strub|Dr. Charles H "Doc" Strub]] was having trouble locating a site.  In the Los Angeles area, a group headed by movie producer [[Hal Roach]] was in need of further funds.  These two groups combined and the newly formed Los Angeles Turf Club opened the present day track on Christmas Day in 1934, making it the first formally-established racetrack in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santaanitaparkracing.com/|title=Santa Anita Park Thoroughbred Race Track|work=santaanitaparkracing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architect [[Gordon Kaufmann]] designed its various buildings in a combination of [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] and a type of [[art deco]] known as [[Streamline Modern]], painted primarily in Santa Anita's signature colors of [[Shades of green|Persian Green]] and [[Lemon chiffon|Chiffon Yellow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/santa-anita-park|title=Santa Anita Park|work=laconservancy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1935, the first [[Santa Anita Handicap]] was run. The race's $100,000 purse, largest of any race ever in the United States until that time, produced its nickname the Big 'Cap. 
[[Image:SantaAnitaEntrance wb.jpg|thumb|left|Art deco entrance to Santa Anita's grandstands.]]

In its heyday, the track's races attracted such stars [[Betty Grable]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Edgar Bergen]], [[Jane Russell]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Esther Williams]], and other stars. [[Bing Crosby]], [[Joe E. Brown]], [[Al Jolson]], and [[Harry Warner]] were all stockholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dyer|first=Braven|title=The Story of Santa Anita|url=http://www.sportthemagazine.com/1947/01/the-story-of-santa-anita/|work=SPORT Magazine|accessdate=10 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311064339/http://www.sportthemagazine.com/1947/01/the-story-of-santa-anita/|archivedate=11 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the leadership of Doc Strub, Santa Anita initiated many innovations that are now standard in thoroughbred horse racing, such as the use of starting gates and photo finishes for every race. Paradoxically, the implementation of photo finishes at Santa Anita recorded an increase in dead heats.  Santa Anita was so successful that in its first year under Doc Strub's leadership, it paid its investors a 100% dividend on their investment.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
[[File:Santa Anita Track (3446121612).jpg|thumb|The unique downhill turf course includes a section where horses have to momentarily cross the dirt track]]
In 1940, [[Seabiscuit]] won the Santa Anita Handicap in his last start. Two years later, in 1942, racing at Santa Anita was suspended due to the [[Second World War]], when Santa Anita was used as an "assembly center" for [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese Americans excluded]] from the West Coast.&lt;ref name=hmdb&gt;{{cite web|title=Santa Anita During World War II|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=68088|website=Historical Marker Database|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Santa Anita Park#Santa Anita Assembly Center|below]].) For several months in 1942, over 18,000 people lived in horse stables and military-style barracks constructed on the site, including actor [[George Takei]], then a young boy. After the track reopened in 1945,&lt;ref name=hmdb /&gt; it went through the postwar years with prosperity. A downhill turf course, which added a distinctly European flair to racing at Santa Anita, was added in 1953.

Due to its proximity to Los Angeles, Santa Anita has traditionally been associated with the film and television industries. The racetrack sequences in the [[Marx Brothers]] 1937 classic ''[[A Day at the Races (film)|A Day at the Races]]'' were filmed there, and ''[[The Story of Seabiscuit]]'' with [[Shirley Temple]] was filmed on location in 1949.&lt;ref name="Seabiscuit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/western-region/santa-anita-racetrack.html|title=Plan your next trip with the National Trust - National Trust for Historic Preservation|website=Preservationnation.org|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also featured in ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1937).&lt;ref&gt;Alleman, Richard (2013). ''Hollywood: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie L.A.'' Crown/Archetype. Page 471. {{ISBN|9780804137775}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several stars, including [[Bing Crosby]], [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Alex Trebek]], and [[MGM]] mogul, [[Louis B. Mayer]], have owned horses that raced at the park.

The 1958 Santa Anita Derby was attended by 61,123 people, making the attendance that day a record crowd.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} They had come to watch [[Silky Sullivan]] come from 28 lengths off the pace and win—going away.

The 1960s brought about a major renovation of Santa Anita Park, including a much-expanded grandstand as well as major seating additions. In 1968&lt;!-- this said 19689 so not sure whether '68 or '69; i guessed. -elf --&gt;, [[Del Mar Racetrack]] relinquished its dates for a fall meeting. A group of horsemen including [[Clement L. Hirsch|Clement Hirsch]] intervened and established the not-for-profit [[Oak Tree Racing Association]]. Oak Tree had no facilities of its own and rented Santa Anita Park for its first autumn meeting in 1969. The Oak Tree Association became the operator of the autumn meet at Santa Anita Park. This meet usually ran from the end of September until early November. Many key stakes races were held during the Oak Tree Meeting, including many preps to the [[Breeders' Cup]] races. The Oak Tree meet relocated to [[Hollywood Park Racetrack|Hollywood Park]] for 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/58471/oak-tree-headed-for-hollywood-after-all "Oak Tree Headed for Hollywood After All"], ''The Blood-Horse'', August 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but the California Horse Racing Board awarded the fall dates to Santa Anita in its own right in 2011. This prompted a renaming of many stakes races held at the fall meeting that were formerly associated with Oak Tree. For example, the Norfolk, Goodwood, Yellow Ribbon, Lady's Secret, and Oak Leaf, were renamed at the FrontRunner, Awesome Again, Rodeo Drive, Zenyatta and Chandelier respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Larry|title=Santa Anita's horse racing Fall Meet is not Oak Tree anymore|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/article/ZZ/20120928/NEWS/120927766|website=Dailybreeze.com|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosperity continued at Santa Anita throughout the 1970s and the 1980s. In 1984, Santa Anita was the site of [[Equestrian at the 1984 Summer Olympics|equestrian]] events at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt1.pdf 1984 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 1. Part 1. pp. 117-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the track set an attendance record of 85,527 people on Santa Anita Handicap Day. However, recognizing the potential revenue boon to the State of California, the California Legislature expanded off track betting, bring operating betting parlors within closer driving distance of the race-day tracks. While the Santa Anita meeting could still draw large crowds, attendance had decreased by a third.  Only 56,810 people were at the park for Santa Anita Derby Day 2007 to witness a Grade I event.

In 1997, Santa Anita Park was acquired by Meditrust when it purchased the Santa Anita Companies for its unique [[real estate investment trust]] paired share corporate structure. Following the elimination of the special tax treatment accorded Pair Share [[Real estate investment trust|REIT]]s, Meditrust sold the track to [[Magna Entertainment Corp.]] Magna still owns Santa Anita Park. In 2006, [[Gulfstream Park]] and Santa Anita cohosted the [[Sunshine Millions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunshinemillions.com/|title=News &amp; Barn Notes|website=Sunshinemillions.com|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a day of competition with $3.6 million in stakes races between horses bred in the [[Florida|State of Florida]] and those bred in the [[California|State of California]].

At Santa Anita standardbred racing was also conducted.

At Santa Anita Park's European-style paddock there are [[statue]]s of jockeys [[George Woolf]], [[Johnny Longden]], [[Bill Shoemaker]] and [[Laffit Pincay, Jr.]] plus a memorial [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of announcer [[Joe Hernandez (race caller)|Joe Hernandez]] and one of trainer [[Charlie Whittingham]] with his dog, Toby. There is also a lifesize bronze of [[Seabiscuit]] in the walking ring at Seabiscuit Court; a similar bronze of [[John Henry (horse)|John Henry]] was unveiled near the Seabiscuit statue in December 2009.  Buried near the paddock is [[Emperor of Norfolk]], the best horse Lucky Baldwin ever owned, along with three other great Baldwin horses: Volante, Silver Cloud, and Rey El Santa Anita, all four of them winners of the prestigious [[American Derby]]. In 2012, a lifesize bronze of [[Zenyatta]] was unveiled prior to the running of the race renamed in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Steve|title=Santa Anita: Zenyatta statue unveiled prior to running of stakes in her honor|url=http://www.drf.com/news/santa-anita-zenyatta-statue-unveiled-prior-running-stakes-her-honor|website=Daily Racing Form|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1950, Santa Anita Park has annually presented the [[George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award]] to a rider who demonstrates high standards of personal and professional conduct, on and off the racetrack.

[[South Africa]]n native [[Trevor Denman]] served as Santa Anita's full-time announcer from the 1983 Oak Tree meet until his retirement from the position in 2015.&lt;ref name=SA120415&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Trevor Denman, The Voice of Santa Anita Since 1983, Announces Retirement from 'The Great Race Place'|url=http://www.santaanita.com/press-releases/trevor-denman-the-voice-of-santa-anita-since-1983-announces-retirement-from-the-great-race-place/|location=Arcadia, Calif.|publisher=Santa Anita Park|date=December 4, 2015|access-date=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denman is noted for his calls beginning with "And awaaay they go..." and his distinctive gravelly voice. [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] native [[Michael Wrona]] was chosen to succeed Denman in March 2016.&lt;ref name=SA240316&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Michael Wrona Named Santa Anita Track Announcer|url=http://www.santaanita.com/press-releases/michael-wrona-named-santa-anita-track-announcer/|location=Arcadia, CA|publisher=Santa Anita Park|date=2016-03-24|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2014, Santa Anita began adding more racing cards due to the closure of [[Hollywood Park Racetrack]], hosting Hollywood Park's old spring dates from late April until June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/78167/hollywood-park-to-close-in-december|title=Hollywood Park to Close in December|last1=LaMarra|first1=Tom|date=May 9, 2013|website=Bloodhorse.com|publisher=The BloodHorse|accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arcadia High School holds its graduation ceremonies at Santa Anita Park in June and its high school graduating class reunions, organized by the school's alumni association, in October.

===Santa Anita Assembly Center===
[[File:Santa Anita Assembly Center, Arcadia, California. A panoramic view of the Santa Anita assembly cent . . . - NARA - 536812.jpg|thumb|A panoramic view of the Santa Anita Assembly Center.]]
{{Commons category|Santa Anita Assembly Center}}
After President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order 9066]], which authorized military commanders to exclude "any or all persons" from certain areas in the name of national defense, the [[Western Defense Command]] began ordering Japanese Americans living on the West Coast to present themselves for "evacuation" from the newly created military zones. Seventeen temporary "assembly centers" were designated to house the evicted population until construction on the more permanent and isolated internment camps was finished. Most, like Santa Anita, were converted from former uses like racing tracks or fairgrounds.&lt;ref name=Linke&gt;Linke, Konrad. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Santa%20Anita%20%28detention%20facility%29/ "Santa Anita (detention facility)"] ''Densho Encyclopedia''. Retrieved July 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Anita was turned over to the Wartime Civilian Control Administration, the government body responsible for oversight of the temporary detention facilities, in March 1942, and army engineers soon after built 500 barracks on the parking lot and converted the horse stables and the area underneath the grandstand into residential "apartments." Inmates began arriving in April, most coming from the surrounding Los Angeles County, and the center's population soon topped 18,000, peaking at 18,719 by August of that year. Six mess halls, each seating approximately 850 at a time, fed some 3,000 people daily at a cost of 33 cents per inmate. The sanitary facilities faced similar overcrowding, with a ratio of 30 inmates to each shower ''after'' the number of showers was increased from 150 to 225 in early July. Consequently, inmates spent a significant portion of their time in Santa Anita waiting in line for meals or to use the sanitary facilities.&lt;ref name=Linke/&gt;

The Assembly Center remained open for seven months, and in the meantime, inmates took up jobs in camp at the camouflage net factory, the hospital or various administrative departments, and set up schools to ensure their children's education would not be interrupted. Transfer to [[War Relocation Authority]] camps began on August 26, 1942, when 901 inmates left for [[Poston War Relocation Center|Poston]], Arizona, and over the next month the remaining Japanese Americans were sent to Poston and several other camps. The Santa Anita Assembly Center closed on October 27, 1942.&lt;ref name=Linke/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/08/local/me-then8|title=Santa Anita racetrack played a role in WWII internment|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 8, 2009|first=Alison|last=Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course attributes==
[[Image:SantaAnitaTrackMtns wb.jpg|thumb|right|The Santa Anita track is set against the backdrop of the [[San Gabriel Mountains]].]]Santa Anita has a one-mile (1,609 m) natural dirt main track which rings a turf course measuring 0.9 mile, or {{convert|1,584|yd|m}}. In addition, it has an unusual hillside turf course which crosses the dirt and is used mainly to run turf races at a distance of "about" 6½ furlongs (exact distance is {{convert|1,408.5|yd|m}}). This type of track is one of the few of its kind in America.

To comply with a State of California mandate, Santa Anita replaced its dirt racing surface with a new synthetic surface called [[Synthetic racetrack surfaces for horse racing|Cushion Track]], a mixture of silica sand, synthetic fibers, elastic fiber, granulated rubber and a wax coating. The new Cushion Track opened for training on Sept 4, 2007 and hosted its first live race on Sept 26, 2007. The track lost 11 racing dates in 2008 due to a drainage problem with the new material, but intensive maintenance and the addition of a liquid binder greatly improved the artificial surface.  Santa Anita replaced the artificial surface with a return to an all natural dirt surface in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santaanita.com/press/pressrelease/2010/12/santa-anita-main-track-reopens-training-natural-dirt-surface-withstands |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926234615/http://www.santaanita.com/press/pressrelease/2010/12/santa-anita-main-track-reopens-training-natural-dirt-surface-withstands |archivedate=2011-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Anita occupies {{convert|320|acre|km2}}. It has a {{convert|1100|ft|m|adj=on}}-long grandstand, which is a historic landmark that seats 26,000 guests. The grandstand facade is rendered in an [[Art Deco]] style and is largely the original from the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/western-region/santa-anita-racetrack.html National Trust for Historic Preservation], Santa Anita racetrack, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  The track infield area, which resembles a park with picnic tables and large trees, can accommodate 50,000 or more guests. The Park also contains 61 barns, which house more than 2,000 horses, and an equine hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://santaanita.com|title=Live Horse Racing – Bet on Horse Racing at Santa Anita Park|website=Santa Anita Park|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endangerment and reprieve==
In 2000, the racetrack was named to America's "Most Endangered Historic Places" list. The Santa Anita Racetrack was determined eligible for listing in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20060818.HTM |title=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 8/07/06 through 8/11/06 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |date=August 18, 2006 |accessdate=May 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continued to be threatened by developer's plans.  A themed entertainment complex proposal was aborted, but there were new plans are in the works for the parking and support areas adjacent to the historic race track and grandstands.&lt;ref name="Seabiscuit"/&gt;

In 2006, there was a proposal to close Santa Anita Park and use its location as the site of a new retail/entertainment complex. The Arcadia City Council approved a plan In April 2007 to develop an 830,000 square foot commercial, retail, and office complex in the south parking area, where the barracks that housed interned Japanese Americans during World War II are located. The proposal planned to tear down the South Ticket Gate and the 1938 Saddling Barn, and to install a simulcast facility in the center of the historic grandstand.&lt;ref name="Seabiscuit"/&gt;  In April 2008, a plan was approved to use large parts of the existing track parking lot to construct a mall, the "Shops at Santa Anita"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carusoaffiliated.com/newsroom/latimes_4-18-2007.shtml "Acadia OKs Caruso Mall Near Racetrack"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109073648/http://www.carusoaffiliated.com/newsroom/latimes_4-18-2007.shtml |date=2008-11-09 }}, ''Los Angeles Times'', April 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arcadia.patch.com/articles/caruso-pushes-to-build-the-shops-at-santa-anita |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722015422/http://arcadia.patch.com/articles/caruso-pushes-to-build-the-shops-at-santa-anita |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|May 2011}}, the plans to build another mall next to Santa Anita Park were abandoned. Protests against the project by the Westfield group, owner of the adjacent Westfield Santa Anita Mall (built in 1974 on the site of the old barns and training track), and the bankruptcy of [[Magna International]], owner of Santa Anita Park, were a factor in the decision.&lt;ref name="reprieve"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/losangeles/news/2011/05/23/santa-anita-mall-plans-scrapped.html | title=Efforts to build mall near Santa Anita officially over|website=Bizjournals.com | date=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John F. Savage Arena''' (formerly '''John F. Savage Hall''' and '''Centennial Hall''') is a multi-purpose [[arena]] located in [[Toledo, Ohio]], on the campus of the [[University of Toledo]].  The arena opened in 1976 and originally seated 9,000 for basketball and up to 10,000 for concerts.  As part of a $30 million renovation and addition to the arena, completed in 2008, the [[seating capacity]] was reduced to 7,300 for basketball and up to 8,300 for concerts.  It primarily serves as the home venue for the [[Toledo Rockets]] men's and women's basketball teams and women's volleyball team, and also hosts concerts, commencement exercises, and other events.

==Features==
Savage Arena features {{convert|33,000|sqft|m2}}of space on its arena floor, large enough to accommodate an ice rink, an [[arena football]] field, a [[rodeo]] ring, five basketball courts, eight [[volleyball]] courts, five [[tennis]] courts, six [[racquetball]] courts, 22 [[badminton]] courts, and a 300-yard (274 m) indoor track. There is also a 48x56 foot portable stage. The Joe Grogan Room, which seats 200 for dinners, is located at the arena's south side, above the running track. The glass-enclosed room contains a lounge and a bar. More than $350,000 was spent on building and equipping the Joe Grogan Room. All funds for the room were raised through $5,000 pledges by members of the Rocket Club, the athletic department's main support group that now totals more than 1,000 members.

The arena is built with long span trusses that support the roof, {{convert|57|ft|m}} above the arena floor. The trusses also support the arena's public address and ventilation systems, a catwalk system for service and maintenance, and the arena's center-court scoreboard. The arena is named for John F. Savage, a university alum (Class of 1952) who was instrumental in the arena's construction. The free span is {{convert|200|ft|m}} from wall to wall. The building structure and wall systems are constructed of noncombustible material.

==Men's basketball==
[[File:Savage Arena 2.JPG|left|250px|thumbnail|Interior of Savage Arena in 2012]]
In the first game played in Savage Arena, the [[Toledo Rockets men's basketball|men's basketball team]] defeated defending NCAA champion [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]] 59–57.  With that win, the Rockets snapped [[Bobby Knight]] and the Hoosiers' 33-game winning streak.  At Savage Hall, Toledo has beaten Ohio State, Xavier, Cincinnati, Houston and Pittsburgh.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The longest consecutive winning streak by the Rockets in Savage Arena is 16 games, during the 1978–79 season. During that streak, UT outscored opponents by an average of 17 points per game.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}  Between November 30, 1978 and December 1, 1981, the Rockets recorded a 45–3 (.938) home record.  Prior to the 1985–86 season, they had lost back-to-back games at home only twice in 146 contests.

Toledo has won 73.5% of its games at home, posting a 312–112 record. During the first five years in Savage Arena, UT posted a 71–10 (.877) record, with a 15–1 mark in 1976–77 and 1978–79 and a 14–1 slate in 1979–80. Under former head coach [[Stan Joplin]], the Rockets were 84–22 (.792) at Savage Arena. The Rockets have also ranked among the MAC leaders in attendance,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} averaging 6,640 fans per game since the arena opened in 1976. Last year,{{When|date=February 2009}} Toledo led the MAC with an average attendance of 5,292.

In 1980–81, the Rockets set a school record with 147,203 in total attendance, the 30th-best total in the nation,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} and during the 1999–2000 season the Rockets eclipsed the 2,500,000 attendance mark in arena history.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Other uses==
In addition to the activity areas, Savage Arena contains athletic department offices, a reception area, press room, sports medicine and therapy rooms, laundry and equipment facilities and locker rooms with showers and saunas for both men and women.  It is also the site of convocations and commencement ceremonies, as well as the occasional conventions.

The facility has hosted five [[Mid-American Conference]] men's basketball tournaments: 1985, 1987–1989, and 1995.  In addition, the arena hosted U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] and Mexican president [[Vicente Fox]] in 2001.  [[World Championship Wrestling]] used Savage Arena as its Toledo stop until its 2001 folding.  

Among the many performers who have played Savage Arena over the years have been [[Elvis Presley]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Elton John]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Boyz II Men]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Kenny Chesney]], [[Tim McGraw]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Van Halen]], Alabama, Charlie Daniel's, The Judds, John Schneider and, more recently, [[Chris Brown (American entertainer)|Chris Brown]], [[Katy Perry]], [[The Black Keys]], [[P!nk]], [[Eric Church]] and [[American Idol|American Idols Live!]].  Of note, Savage Arena hosted [[Crystal Bowersox]]'s homecoming performance when it hosted the 2010 edition of the latter show.  As part of their [[Promises (Sanctus Real song)|Promises]] Tour, the Christian rock band [[Sanctus Real]] had their homecoming concert at Savage Arena in 2013. [[Kiss (band)]] performed at the arena during their 1997 Reunion Tour, a professionally shot recording of which has been widely bootlegged.

==Renovation==
On July 17, 2006, a gift of $5 million, the largest single gift ever made to the UT athletic department, was donated and earmarked for use on the new Savage Hall update project. These funds were used along with those obtained in a capital raising campaign in order to make major repairs and upgrades to the facility, including an all new athletic center. Final plans included new locker rooms, weight rooms, a pro shop, a Rocket Hall-of-Fame, new ticket offices and a professional office area, as well as  revamping of the main arena area which modernized every aspect of the Savage Hall experience.  The complex was also renamed Savage Arena. The renovations, which totaled $30 million, were completed in time for the 2008-09 basketball season.

There are also plans in the works to attach an enclosed indoor practice complex for both the basketball and football teams.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1758">The [[United States Football League]] besides having a traditional [[USFL Collegiate Draft|Collegiate Draft]], it also practiced an annual '''Territorial Draft''', in which teams from the league would have “protected” colleges from their respective states, from which they could select a number of players without them being subjected to the regular [[USFL Collegiate Draft|Collegiate Draft]].

==Procedure and rules==
===Objective===
This process was conceived by [[United States Football League|USFL]] founder [[David Dixon (businessman)|David Dixon]], in order to keep geographic interest in the franchises. With the '''Territorial Draft''', local college or professional [[American Football|football players]], would end up playing for the state's [[United States Football League|USFL]] team.

===Eligibility===
Each team was assigned a five college pool that were deemed to be in the team's region, from which it could select a predetermined number of players.

===Process===
The territorial selections were conducted by the teams, who communicated their choices to the league's office in writing. Once "drafted", a player's [[United States Football League|USFL]] rights belonged to that club, and were ineligible from selection in the regular college draft. 

The league's office in turn would send out these lists to all teams, prohibiting them from drafting these players in the regular college draft.

'''Valerio Ciccone''' (born Melbourne 1970) is an Australian artist who is best known for his drawings of mass-media events and icons taken from popular culture. He has worked from his Northcote-based studio at [https://www.artsproject.org.au/ Arts Project Australia] since 1984, where he has also had numerous solo shows.  He has exhibited widely, both nationally and internationally [see Exhibitions] and his work is held in the collections of the [[National Gallery of Australia]], MADMusée, [[Liege|Liège]], and the [[National Sports Museum]].

== Early life and education ==
Ciccone grew up in the semi-rural suburb of Yarrambat, the third of four children.  According to his mother, he began “drawing obsessively” from the age of four or five, and even at this young age his key source of imagery was taken from the mass media (television and newspapers).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Valerio Ciccone: Peripheral Observer|last=Daye|first=Cheryl|publisher=Arts Project Australia|year=2011|isbn=9780646582351|location=Melbourne|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his childhood that he began creating his collection of rendered logos from favourite television shows, a collection he has continued to expand throughout his life, alongside others, including a collection of music cassettes which extends to over 1000 objects.  Ciccone has demonstrated an extraordinary memory for these collections (which remain unlabelled and yet are perfectly organised and accessible for him) and an ability to recall the names of individual persons met briefly, over periods stretching many years.  This ability has been noted as a key component of his artwork, informing the connections he draws between figures of public life and popular culture, and the attention to detail in his technical execution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1984 Ciccone was one of the first artists to take up a studio residency at [[Arts Project Australia]] (APA), an organisation devoted to supporting and promoting artists with an intellectual disability. Although he has received little formal training, his participation in the studio program at APA  provided him with access to fine art materials and the informal tuition provided by the practicing artists employed by the organisation. He also spent a number of years attending weekly drawing classes at the [[RMIT School of Art|School of Art]] at [[RMIT|RMIT University]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ciccone’s early works were in watercolour and in the early 1990s he produced a series of monochrome drawings featuring imagery and text taken directly from newspapers.  Following a serious illness in 1993 and a lengthy period of rehabilitation, his work underwent a significant change as he introduced colour to his palette.  During this time he produced artworks centred on the actions and heroics of [[Australian rules football|Australian Rules Football]] players, one of which has been acquired for the permanent collection of the [[National Sports Museum]].

== Career, themes and style ==
Glenn Barkley, Curator at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art Australia]], has described Ciccone’s “obsessive engagement” with television and mass media presentations of sporting events as being a quintessential trait of his generation, stating that for “Generation X,” there is “little difference between what we might watch and how we might feel.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barkley|first=Glenn|year=2011|title=This is me – some thoughts on the art of Valerio Ciccone|url=|journal=Valerio Ciccone: Peripheral Observer|volume=|pages=|via=Arts Project Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes the manner in which Ciccone democratises his subjects, describing an oeuvre of works in which “cathedrals are as important as the corner of a studio and lions lie with mice, and elephants, and koala bears.” However, Barkley is careful to point out that Ciccone’s works are not flippant; he attributes his use of low-brow televisual imagery to a project which elevates and finds meaning in banal aspects of contemporary life, claiming that he “celebrates the mundane, the disposable and finds it beautiful.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Stylistically, Ciccone’s rendering of mass media personages and events in soft, layered pastel, work towards this elevation of his subject, transforming the “flatness of newsprint or flickering image on the screen” into something “warm and personal.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Although best known for his works in pastel on paper, Ciccone has worked in a range of mediums including painting, printmaking, ceramics and digital animation.  His work has been categorised within the genre of [[Outsider art|Outsider Art]] and has been included in Outsider Art exhibitions and fairs, both in Australia and in the USA. However, in recent years his work has also achieved success in more conventional art institutions and has been acquired for major permanent collections at the [[National Gallery of Australia]] (Print Archive) and MADMusée, [[Liege|Liège]], Belgium.

'''WesBank Raceway''' was a motorsport facility situated at [[Germiston]] in the [[Gauteng]] province of [[South Africa]].  It was built on the site of a former horse racing track ([[Gosforth Park (South Africa)|Gosforth Park]]) opened in 2003.  

The facility featured an oval track, [[dragstrip]], road circuit and [[motorcross]] track, allowing for a wide range of events.  It was so named due to a sponsorship deal with the South African [[WesBank]] company. The track closed in November 2007 after the property was sold to developers.
