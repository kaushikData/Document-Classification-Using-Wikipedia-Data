'''Al-Habash''' was an ancient region in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Situated in the northern highlands of modern-day [[Eritrea]] and [[Ethiopia]],&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;Sven Rubenson, The survival of Ethiopian independence, (Tsehai, 2003), p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; it was inhabited by the ''Habash'' or Abyssinians, who were the forebears of the [[Habesha people]].&lt;ref name="Blank"&gt;Jonah Blank, Mullahs on the mainframe: Islam and modernity among the Daudi Bohras, (University of Chicago Press, 2001), p.163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the neighboring ''Barbaroi'' (Berbers) of [[Barbara (region)|Barbara]] i.e. [[Somalis|Somali]] people, the Habash are recorded in the 1st century [[Greeks|Greek]] travelogue the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' as engaging in extensive commercial trade with [[Egypt]], among other areas. The document also relates a strong connection with the "Frankincense Country" in the [[Al Mahrah Governorate|Mahra]] region of modern [[Yemen]] and a symbiotic relationship with the ancient [[Sabaeans]], with whom the Habash were allied.&lt;ref name=Schoff&gt;[[Wilfred Harvey Schoff]], The [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]: travel and trade in the [[Indian Ocean]], (Longmans, Green, and Co., 1912) p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2792">The '''Angolan montane forest-grassland mosaic''' ecoregion is located on the east-facing inland side of the belt of mountains that stands parallel to the coast of [[Angola]], 50–100&amp;nbsp;km inland.

==Location and description==
These inland slopes are mostly covered with grassland and savanna. The woodland once covered a much larger area but today only patches survive, mainly in deep ravines and on the higher peaks in [[Huambo Province|Huambo]] and [[Cuanza Sul Province|Cuanza Sul]] provinces, such as [[Mount Moco]], and on the [[Serra da Chela]] in [[Huíla Province]].

The area has a wet summer and some mist and rainfall year-round so water is fairly abundant though in the dry season obtainable in some places only by digging in the sandy beds of the rivers.
&lt;ref&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=at1001|name=Angolan montane forest-grassland mosaic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
In the dry season fires are common and the dry grasses burn and are then renewed. The trees are not so vulnerable to fire. The woodland flora has similarities with other mountain ranges spread across Africa. Plants on the inland ridge include the shrubs such as ''[[Erica]]''s, sugarbushes (''[[Protea]]'') and ''[[Cliffortia]]''s, and grasses ''[[Themeda triandra]]'', ''[[Tristachya]]''s, ''[[Hyparrhenia]]''s, ''[[Festuca]]''s, and ''[[Monocymbium]]''.

==Fauna==
The fauna includes a number of bird species unique to the highlands such as [[Boulton's batis]] (''Batis margaritae''), [[Swierstra's francolin]] (''Francolinus swierstra''), [[Angola cave-chat]] (''Xenocopsychus ansorgei'') [[grey-striped francolin]] (''Francolinus griseostriatus'') and [[Angola slaty flycatcher]] (''Dioptrornis brunneus''). Some of these species have close relatives in other forests of the continent, more indication that this woodland was once much more widespread. The hills were home to large mammals such as zebras and antelopes until recently.

==Threats==
The highlands are one of the most heavily populated parts of Angola so the woodland is vulnerable to clearance for logging, while some of the grassland, except where it is very swampy, is being cleared for agriculture. Furthermore, the mountains have been the scene of much conflict and poverty during the [[Angolan Civil War]] and as a consequence the wildlife has been little studied or protected. Towns and cities in this region include [[Huambo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Angolan montane forest-grassland mosaic|id=at1001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saxton's Frontispiece.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece to Saxton's ''Atlas of the Counties of England and Wales'']]
'''Christopher Saxton''' (c. 1540 – c. 1610) was an English [[cartographer]] who produced the first county maps of England and Wales.

==Life and family==
Saxton was probably born in Sowood, [[Ossett]] in the parish of [[Dewsbury]], in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] in either 1542 or 1544. His family subsequently moved to the hamlet of [[Dunningley]] near [[Tingley]] in the parish of [[Woodkirk]] where the Saxton name is recorded in 1567.{{sfn|Evans|Lawrence|1979|p=1|ps=}} It is speculated that Saxton may have attended the predecessor school to [[Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield]] and also speculated that he was a student at [[Cambridge University]] but neither is corroborated.{{sfn|Evans|Lawrence|1979|p=5|ps=}} It is most likely that [[John Rudd (cartographer)|John Rudd]], the vicar of Dewsbury and [[Thornhill, West Yorkshire|Thornhill]], a keen [[Cartography|cartographer]] passed his skills to Saxton.{{sfn|Evans|Lawrence|1979|p=6|ps=}}

Saxton married and had three children. Robert, born in 1585 was his father's assistant in 1601 and drew a map of Snapethorpe in Wakefield when it was surveyed by his father. Robert was commissioned to survey [[Sandal Magna]] in 1607.{{sfn|Evans|Lawrence|1979|p=3|ps=}} Christopher Saxton died in either 1610 or 1611.{{sfn|Evans|Lawrence|1979|p=2|ps=}}

==Career==

[[File:Saxton’s Proof Map of Wales.jpg|thumb|Saxton’s unpublished Proof Map of Wales, 1580]]
Map making became increasingly common in the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] made possible by advances in surveying technology and printing from engraved copper plates. Accurate mapping of the whole country became increasingly important. [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]] was instrumental in ensuring that a court official, [[Thomas Seckford]] of [[Woodbridge, Suffolk]], financed the commission.&lt;ref name ="BL"&gt;{{citation |title=Saxton’s map of Northumbria|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/mapsviews/saxtonmap/ |publisher=British Library |accessdate=14 May  2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1574 Saxton began the survey of England.{{sfn|Evans|Lawrence|1979|p=7|ps=}} In consideration of the expenses involved, Queen Elizabeth granted him a lease on lands at Grigstone Manor in Suffolk. The Welsh survey began in 1577.{{sfn|Evans|Lawrence|1979|p=11|ps=}} Surveying the country was a significant undertaking but the first plates were engraved by 1574 and in 1578 the survey was complete.{{sfn|Evans|Lawrence|1979|p=9|ps=}} As the task was finished in a short timespan is possible that Saxton used some of John Rudd's earlier work.&lt;ref name ="BL"/&gt; Individual county sheets were issued before the completed survey was issued as an atlas in 1579. The proofs were presented to Lord Burghley who compiled them into an atlas of his own.{{sfn|Evans|Lawrence|1979|p=9|ps=}}

The maps were produced in the ''Atlas of the Counties of England and Wales'' published in 1579, the first atlas of any country. It contained 35 maps, each bearing the arms of [[Elizabeth I]] and Thomas Seckford, Saxton's patron. The maps show hills and mountains but do not provide precise information as to their location or altitude. A variety of symbols show buildings and settlements.{{sfn|Evans|Lawrence|1979|p=9|ps=}} All the maps are dated except for Northumberland. Five counties, Cornwall, Essex, Hertfordshire, The Suffolk and Norfolk maps show the division into [[Hundred (county division)|hundreds]].{{sfn|Evans|Lawrence|1979|p=10|ps=}} The atlas was a commercial success, prompting other cartographers including [[John Speed]], John Norton, and [[Michael Drayton]] to attempt similar enterprises, adding to and adapting Saxton's work.{{sfn|Ferrington|2002|p=107|ps=}}

The maps drawn by Saxton were engraved by [[Augustine Ryther]], [[Remigius Hogenberg]], William Hole, William Kip, Leonard Terwoort of Antwerp, Nicholas Reynold of London, Cornelius Hogius, and Francis Scatter. The engravers were of Dutch or Flemish origin.&lt;ref name ="BL"/&gt; There is no evidence on the maps that Saxton engraved them himself, but according to one account, he engraved those of the Welsh counties and Herefordshire. Saxton obtained a license to sell the maps for a term of ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Saxton, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Dee]], warden of the [[Manchester Cathedral|Manchester's collegiate church]] employed Saxton to survey Manchester's parish boundaries in 1596 but no copy has survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=101 Treasures of Chetham's: Material associated with John Dee (1527-1608) |url=http://www.chethams.org.uk/treasures/treasures_dee.html |publisher=Chetham's |accessdate=16 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416230255/http://www.chethams.org.uk/treasures/treasures_dee.html |archivedate=16 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chetham's Library]] in Manchester has a copy of the atlas,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=101 Treasures of Chetham's|url=http://www.chethams.org.uk/treasures/treasures_saxton.html|publisher=Chetham's|accessdate=31 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831024033/http://www.chethams.org.uk/treasures/treasures_saxton.html|archivedate=31 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] in Washington, D.C.{{sfn|Ferrington|2002|p=107|ps=}}

'''Complete spatial randomness''' ('''CSR''') describes a [[point process]] whereby point events occur within a given study area in a completely random fashion. It is synonymous with a homogeneous [[spatial Poisson process]].&lt;ref name="Omaimon2010DataM"&gt;O. Maimon, L. Rokach, ''Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Handbook'' , Second Edition, Springer  2010, pages 851-852
&lt;/ref&gt; Such a process is modeled using only one parameter &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the density of points within the defined area. The term complete spatial randomness is commonly used in Applied Statistics in the context of examining certain point patterns, whereas in most other statistical contexts it is referred to the concept of a spatial Poisson process.&lt;ref name="Omaimon2010DataM"&gt;O. Maimon, L. Rokach, ''Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Handbook'' , Second Edition, Springer  2010, pages 851-852
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model ==
Data in the form of a set of points, irregularly distributed within a region of space, arise in many different contexts; examples include locations of trees in a forest, of nests of birds, of nuclei in tissue, of ill people in a population at risk. We call any such data-set a spatial point pattern and refer to the locations as events, to distinguish these from arbitrary points of the region in question. The hypothesis of complete spatial randomness for a spatial point pattern asserts that the number of events in any region follows a [[Poisson distribution]] with given mean count per uniform subdivision. The events of a pattern are independently and uniformly distributed over space; in other words, the events are equally likely to occur anywhere and do not interact with each other.

"Uniform" is used in the sense of following a [[uniform probability distribution]] across the study region, not in the sense of “evenly” dispersed across the study region.&lt;ref name="waller2004ApSpSt"&gt; L. A. Waller, [[Carol A. Gotway Crawford|C. A. Gotway]], ''Applied Spatial Statistics for Public Health Data'', volume 1 Wiley Chichester, 2004, pages 119–121,
123–127, 137, 139–141, 146–148,
150–151, 157, 203. &lt;/ref&gt; There are no interactions amongst the events, as the intensity of events does not vary over the plane. For example, the independence assumption would be violated if the existence of one event either encouraged or inhibited the occurrence of other events in the neighborhood.

== Distribution ==
The probability of finding exactly &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; points within the area &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; with event density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;P(k,\rho,V) = \frac{(V\rho)^k e^{-(V\rho) }}{k!} . \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The first moment of which, the [[average]] number of points in the area, is simply &lt;math&gt;\rho V&lt;/math&gt;. This value is intuitive as it is the Poisson rate parameter.

The probability of locating the &lt;math&gt;N^{\mathrm{th}}&lt;/math&gt; neighbor of any given point, at some radial distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;P_N(r) = \frac{D}{(N-1)!}  {\lambda}^N r^{DN-1} e^{- \lambda r^D} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the number of dimensions, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a density-dependent parameter given by &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{\rho \pi ^{\frac{D}{2}}}{\Gamma (\frac{D}{2} +1)} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gamma function]], which when its argument is integer, is simply the [[factorial]] function.

The expected value of &lt;math&gt; P_N(r)&lt;/math&gt; can be derived via the use of the gamma function using statistical moments. The first moment is the mean distance between randomly distributed particles in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; dimensions.

== Applications ==
The study of CSR is essential for the comparison of measured point data from experimental sources. As a statistical testing method, the test for CSR has many applications in the [[social sciences]] and in astronomical examinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galaxy.gmu.edu/interface/I02/I2002Proceedings/HauckSteven/HauckSteven.presentation.ppt|title=Statistics on Venus: Craters and Catastrophes}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSR is often the standard against which data sets are tested. Roughly described one approach to test the CSR hypothesis is the following:&lt;ref name="Okabe2012SpAn"&gt; A. Okabe, K. Sugihara, "Spatial Analysis along Networks- Statistical and Computational Methods", volume 1 Wiley Chichester, 2012, pages 135-136 &lt;/ref&gt;
 
# Use [[statistics]] that are a function of the distance from every event to the next nearest event.
# Firstly focus on a specific event and formulate a method for testing whether the event and the next nearest event are significantly close (or distant).
# Next consider all events and formulate a method for testing whether the average distance from every event to the next nearest event is significantly short (or long).

In cases where computing test statistics analytically is difficult, numerical methods, such as the [[Monte Carlo method]] simulation are employed, by simulating a stochastic process a large number of times.&lt;ref name="Okabe2012SpAn"/&gt;

{{Swedish National Parks}}
'''Dalby Söderskog''' is a small [[national park]] in the province of [[Scania]] in southern [[Sweden]], situated in the [[Lund Municipality|municipality of Lund]], near [[Dalby, Lund Municipality|Dalby]]. It has an area of {{convert|0.36|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} and consists of broadleaf forest. It was established in 1918, when it was thought to be a unique remnant of primeval forest. In fact, the area has previously been used for [[pasture]]. The ground contains much [[limestone]] and [[chalk]], which makes the flora rich. In particular, there are many spring flowers. An earth bank of unknown origin, possibly the ruins of an ancient fort, surrounds parts of the park. The national park encompasses the southern part of [[Dalby hage]], while the northern parts ([[Dalby Norreskog]] and Hästhagen) form a nature reserve.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3833">'''David Ward''' (born July 8, 1938, in [[Manchester]], [[England]]) was the president of the [[American Council on Education]] from September 2001 to September 2008. In 2011 he was appointed Interim Chancellor of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], where he served a prior term as Chancellor from 1993 to 2001, Provost and Vice-Chancellor for Academic Affairs from 1989 to 2003, and Associate Dean of the Graduate School from 1980 to 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acenet.edu/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=22223&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; 

A leading scholar in urban geography, Ward received his B.A.(1959) and M.A.(1961) from the [[University of Leeds]] before moving to the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] on a Fulbright Travel Award, and earning his doctorate there in 1963.  After teaching at [[Carleton University]] and the [[University of British Columbia]], Ward returned to UW–Madison in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.wisc.edu/packages/wardlegacy/bio.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward was born and raised in [[Manchester]]. He is married with two sons and six grandchildren. When he is not in Madison, he resides in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people/Ward/ward-con1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As chancellor, Ward oversaw a major overhaul of UW–Madison's information technology infrastructure, as well as the development of a cluster-hiring program called "The Madison Initiative Investment Plan".  Ward's chancellorship also saw the creation of new undergraduate residential learning communities on campus and the construction and opening of the [[Kohl Center]].  

Ward has served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the [[Internet2|University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development]], Chairman of the Government Relations Council of the [[National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges]], and served on the Committee on Undergraduate Education of the [[Association of American Universities]], the Science Coalition, and the Kellogg Commission on the Future of State and Land-Grant Universities.

In 2011, following [[Carolyn Martin|Carolyn "Biddy" Martin's ]] resignation to become president of Amherst College, Ward was appointed interim chancellor of UW-Madison to serve until a permanent replacement could be found.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelmeyer, Todd.

'''Fauna &amp; Flora International''' ('''FFI'''), formerly the '''Fauna and Flora Preservation Society''', is an international conservation charity and [[non-governmental organization]].

==History==
FFI was founded in 1903 as the '''Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of the Empire''' by a group of [[United Kingdom|British]] naturalists and [[United States|American]] statesmen in [[Africa]]. It later became the '''Fauna Preservation Society''', before being renamed ''[[Fauna]] and [[Flora]] Preservation Society'' in 1981. The goal of the society was to safeguard the future of southern Africa’s large mammal populations, which had declined alarmingly due to over-hunting and habitat encroachment. Working in tandem with landowners, government and sport hunters, the Society helped pass legislation which controlled hunting in vast stretches of [[East Africa]] and [[South Africa]]. This ultimately paved the way for the formation of [[National Park]]s, such as [[Kruger National Park]] and [[Serengeti National Park]].

FFI has been referred to by many historians as the world's first conservation society, and the society's early work in Africa was also trend-setting in [[ecotourism]].

==Activities==
The Society's scientific journal – ''Oryx – The International Journal of Conservation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oryxthejournal.org/ Oryx The Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; – is published on its behalf by [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;ISSN 0030-6053&lt;/ref&gt;

FFI has a seven-step approach to conserving biodiversity:
#Building local capacity for conservation
#Integrating biodiversity and human needs
#Direct protection of species and habitats
#Securing land for conservation
#Emergency response to conservation needs
#Influencing policy and the practice of conservation
#Bridging the gap between business and biodiversity

In line with its seven-step approach to conservation, Fauna &amp; Flora International has endorsed the [[Forests Now Declaration]], which calls for new market based mechanisms to protect tropical forests.

==Structure==
Fauna &amp; Flora International is constituted under English law as a company limited by guarantee&lt;ref&gt;Registered Company Number 2677068&lt;/ref&gt; and is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] with its head office in Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|1011102}}&lt;/ref&gt; FFI has sister organisations in the U.S. and Australia, and a subsidiary in [[Singapore]].

The logo of the society is the [[Arabian oryx]], after the very successful [[Arabian oryx reintroduction#Operation Oryx|Operation Oryx]], a flagship Arabian oryx captive breeding project undertaken by the society.

[[Queen Elizabeth II]] is FFI's patron, and [[Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands]] is the president of the organization. FFI also has a number of high-profile vice-presidents, including [[David Attenborough|Sir David Attenborough]], [[David Bellamy]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Charlotte Uhlenbroek]], [[Rove McManus]], [[Judi Dench]] and [[Lord Browne of Madingley]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/13/stephen-fry-last-chance-to-see&lt;/ref&gt;

FFI has members in over 80 countries.

==Significant landmarks==
*1903 - First publication of the society’s journal, the precursor of ''Oryx - The International Journal of Conservation''
*1962 - [[Arabian oryx reintroduction#Operation Oryx|Operation Oryx]] helps rescue the Arabian oryx from [[extinction]] through a [[captive breeding]] program, with successful reintroductions into the wild in [[Jordan]], [[Oman]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. This was one of the world's first successful captive breeding and reintroduction efforts for an endangered species.
*1966 - [[Peter Scott]], Chairman of ''IUCN Species Survival Commission'', becomes Chairman of FFI and devises the [[IUCN Red List|Red Data Book]]s, a systematic study of all endangered species.
*1971 - Launch of the 100% Fund (now the ''Flagship Species Fund''), set up to support small-scale projects where urgent conservation action is needed to protect endangered species around the world.
*1972 - [[Gerald Durrell]]'s initiative caused the society to start the [[World Conference on Breeding Endangered Species in Captivity as an Aid to their Survival]] at [[Jersey]], the first knowledge sharing among scientists regarding ideas of captive breeding.
*2000 - [[Alexander Peal]], President of the ''Society for the Conservation of Nature of Liberia'', whose work FFI has supported since 1996, receives the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]], one of the highest honours for a conservationist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3919">[[Image:Semnonen Hain by Emil Doepler.jpg|300px|thumb|The Semnones' Grove of Fetters (1905) by Emil Doepler.]]
A '''grove of fetters''' ([[Old Norse]]: '''''Fjöturlundr''''') is mentioned in the [[Poetic Edda|Eddic poem]] "[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
: Helgi obtained [[Sigrún]], and they had sons. Helgi lived not to be old. Dag, the son of Högni, sacrificed to [[Odin]], for vengeance for his father. Odin lent Dag his spear. Dag met with his relation Helgi in a place called Fiöturlund, and pierced him through with his spear. Helgi fell there, but Dag rode to the mountains and told Sigrún what had taken place.
: ― ''Helgakviða Hundingsbana II'', Thorpe's translation
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The description is often compared with a section by [[Tacitus]] on a [[sacred grove]] of the [[Semnones]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:At a stated period, all the tribes of the same race assemble by their representatives in a grove consecrated by the auguries of their forefathers, and by immemorial associations of terror. Here, having publicly slaughtered a human victim, they celebrate the horrible beginning of their barbarous rite. Reverence also in other ways is paid to the grove. No one enters it except bound with a chain, as an inferior acknowledging the might of the local divinity. If he chance to fall, it is not lawful for him to be lifted up, or to rise to his feet; he must crawl out along the ground. All this superstition implies the belief that from this spot the nation took its origin, that here dwells the [[Regnator omnium deus|supreme and all-ruling deity]], to whom all else is subject and obedient.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Due to the resemblance between the two texts, some scholars have identified the deity of the Semnones with [[Wodanaz|an early form of Odin]]. Others suggest an early form of [[Týr]] may have been involved, as he is the Germanic continuation of Proto-Indo-European sky-father '*dyeus', whose cognates are [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Zeus]].  Furthermore, Tacitus reports that the Germanic peoples of his age regarded a "Tuisco" or "Tuisto" as the progenitor of mankind, which is sometimes surmised to be a Latinisation of Proto-Germanic '*Tiwaz', which later became "Týr" in Old Norse.  Ultimately, evidence is insufficient for certain identification.

These Health Authorities were established in 1996.  There were a few changes between then and the final form shown above.   There were originally separate authorities for Barnet and Enfield &amp; Haringey, for Bexley &amp; Greenwich and Bromley, for East &amp; North Hertfordshire and South Hertfordshire, and for the Isle of Wight &amp; Portsmouth and South-East Hampshire.  [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2001/20010740.htm]  Also, the area of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire was partitioned between three authorities : Cambridge &amp; Huntingdon, East Norfolk, and North West Anglia.  North West Anglia included from [[Cambridgeshire]]: [[Peterborough]], [[Fenland District|Fenland]], part of [[Huntingdonshire]], and from [[Norfolk]]: [[King's Lynn and West Norfolk]] and part of [[Breckland (district)|Breckland]].

The '''Horn of Africa''' is a [[peninsula]] in [[East Africa]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wesp/wesp_current/2014wesp_country_classification.pdf|title=United Nations - Geographical Regions|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that juts into the [[Guardafui Channel]], lying along the southern side of the [[Gulf of Aden]] and the southwest [[Red Sea]]. The area is the easternmost projection of the [[Africa|African continent]]. The Horn of Africa denotes the region containing the countries of [[Djibouti]], [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name="Stock"&gt;Robert Stock, ''Africa South of the Sahara, Second Edition: A Geographical Interpretation'', (The Guilford Press: 2004), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodd"&gt;Michael Hodd, ''East Africa Handbook'', 7th Edition, (Passport Books: 2002), p. 21: "To the north are the countries of the Horn of Africa comprising Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti Somaliland and Somalia."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, inc, Jacob E.

These countries share similar peoples, languages, and geographical endowments."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
This peninsula is known by various names. In ancient and medieval times, the Horn of Africa was referred to as the ''[[Barbara (region)|Bilad al Barbar]]'' ("Land of the Berbers").&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Fage, Roland Oliver, Roland Anthony Oliver, ''The Cambridge History of Africa'', (Cambridge University Press: 1977), p.190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Wynn Brereton Huntingford]], Agatharchides, ''The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: With Some Extracts from Agatharkhidēs "On the Erythraean Sea"'', (Hakluyt Society: 1980), p.83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John I. Saeed, ''Somali'' – Volume 10 of London Oriental and African language library, (J. Benjamins: 1999), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as the ''Somali peninsula'', or in the Somali language, ''Geeska Afrika'', ''Jasiiradda Soomaali'' or ''Gacandhulka Soomaali''.&lt;ref&gt;Ciise, Jaamac Cumar. Taariikhdii daraawiishta iyo Sayid Maxamad Cabdille Xasan, 1895-1920. JC Ciise, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In other languages that are local or adjacent to the Horn of Africa, it is known as  የአፍሪካ ቀንድ yäafrika qänd in Amharic,  القرن الأفريقي‎ al-qarn al-'afrīqī in Arabic, Gaaffaa Afriikaa in Oromo and  ቀርኒ ኣፍሪቃ in Tigrinya. The Horn of Africa is sometimes shortened to ''HOA''.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Terrence. Avoiding conflict in the Horn of Africa: US policy toward Ethiopia and Eritrea. No. 21. Council on Foreign Relations Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The  Horn of Africa is quite commonly designated simply the "Horn", while inhabitants are sometimes colloquially referred to as ''Horn Africans''.&lt;ref&gt;Teklehaimanot, Hailay Kidu. "A Mobile Based Tigrigna Language Learning Tool." International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM) 9.2 (2015): 50-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the term ''Greater Horn of Africa'' is used, either to be inclusive of neighbouring northeast African countries, or to distinguish the broader geopolitical definition of the Horn of Africa from narrower peninsular definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Schreck, Carl J., and Fredrick HM Semazzi. "Variability of the recent climate of eastern Africa." International Journal of Climatology 24.6 (2004): 681-701.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greeks and Romans referred to the Somali peninsula as Regio Aromatica or Regio Cinnamonifora due to the aromatic plants, or Regio Incognita owing to its unchartered territory.

Today at the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] straits, the Red Sea is about 12 miles (20 kilometres) wide, but 50,000 years ago it was much narrower and sea levels were 70 meters lower. Though the straits were never completely closed, there may have been islands in between which could be reached using simple rafts.

According to linguists, the Horn of Africa is the [[Afroasiatic Urheimat|original homeland]] of the proto-Afroasiatic language as it is considered the region the Afroasiatic language family displays the greatest diversity, a sign often viewed to represent a geographic origin. The Horn of Africa is also the place where the haplogroup [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] originated from, [[Christopher Ehret]] and Shomarka Keita have suggested that the geography of the E1b1b lineage coincides with the distribution of the Afroasiatic languages.&lt;ref name="ehret2004"&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Christopher Ehret|vauthors=Ehret C, Keita SO, Newman P|date=December 2004|title=The origins of Afroasiatic|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/citation/306/5702/1680c|journal=Science|volume=306|issue=5702|pages=1680; author reply 1680|doi=10.1126/science.306.5702.1680c|pmid=15576591}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic analysis done on the Afroasiatic speaking population further found that a pre-agricultural back-to-Africa migration into the Horn of Africa occurred through Egypt 23,000 years ago and it brought a non-African ancestry dubbed Ethio-Somali in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jason A.

Together with northern [[Somalia]], [[Djibouti]], the [[Red Sea]] coast of [[Sudan]] and [[Eritrea]] is considered the most likely location of the land known to the ancient [[Egyptians]] as ''[[Land of Punt|Punt]]'' (or "Ta Netjeru," meaning god's land), whose first mention dates to the 25th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Simson Najovits, ''Egypt, trunk of the tree, Volume 2'', (Algora Publishing: 2004), p.258.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stela aksum.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[King Ezana's Stela]] at [[Aksum]], symbol of the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite civilization]].]]

[[Dʿmt]] was a kingdom located in Eritrea and northern [[Ethiopia]], which existed during the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. With its capital at [[Yeha]], the kingdom developed [[irrigation]] schemes, used [[plow]]s, grew [[millet]], and made [[iron]] tools and weapons. After the fall of Dʿmt in the 5th century BCE, the plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms, until the rise of one of these kingdoms during the 1st century, the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite Kingdom]], which was able to reunite the area.&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, Richard K.P. ''Addis Tribune'', "[https://web.archive.org/web/20060109162335/http://www.addistribune.com/Archives/2003/01/17-01-03/Let.htm Let's Look Across the Red Sea I]", January 17, 2003 (archive.org mirror copy)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kingdom of Aksum]] (also known as the Aksumite Empire) was an ancient state located in the [[Eritrean highlands]] and [[Ethiopian highlands]], which thrived between the 1st and 7th centuries CE. A major player in the commerce between the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Ancient India]], Aksum's rulers facilitated trade by minting their own [[Aksumite currency|currency]]. The state also established its [[hegemony]] over the declining [[Kingdom of Kush]] and regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the [[Arabian peninsula]], eventually extending its rule over the region with the conquest of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]]. Under [[Ezana]] (fl. 320–360), the kingdom of Aksum became the first major empire to adopt [[Christianity]], and was named by [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] as one of the four great powers of his time, along with [[Sassanid Empire|Persia]], [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and [[Han Dynasty|China]].

[[File:MapHymiariteKingdom.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Ancient trading centers in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian peninsula according to the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'']]

Northern Somalia was an important link in the Horn, connecting the region's commerce with the rest of the ancient world. Somali sailors and merchants were the main suppliers of [[frankincense]], [[myrrh]] and spices, all of which were valuable luxuries to the [[Ancient Egyptians]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaeans]], [[Babylonians]] and [[Roman Empire|Romans]].&lt;ref&gt;Phoenicia, pg. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Jeanne, and John Hulburd, ''The Aromatherapy Book'', p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans consequently began to refer to the region as ''Regio Aromatica''. In the [[Classical antiquity|classical era]], several flourishing Somali city-states such as [[Opone]], [[Mosylon]] and [[Malao]] also competed with the [[Sabaean]]s, [[Parthia]]ns and [[Axumite Empire|Axumites]] for the rich [[India|Indo]]-[[Greco-Roman]] trade.&lt;ref&gt;Vine, Peter, ''Oman in History'', p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[History of Islam|birth of Islam]] opposite the Horn's Red Sea coast meant that local merchants and sailors living on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] gradually came under the influence of the new religion through their converted [[Arab]] Muslim trading partners. With the migration of Muslim families from the [[Islamic world]] to the Horn in the early centuries of Islam, and the peaceful conversion of the local population by Muslim scholars in the following centuries, the ancient city-states eventually transformed into Islamic [[Mogadishu]], [[Berbera]], [[Zeila]], [[Barawa]] and [[Merka]], which were part of the ''[[Barbara (region)|Berber civilization]]''.&lt;ref name="Laitin"&gt;David D. Laitin, Said S. Samatar, ''Somalia: Nation in Search of a State'', (Westview Press: 1987), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.M. Lewis, ''A modern history of Somalia: nation and state in the Horn of Africa'', 2nd edition, revised, illustrated, (Westview Press: 1988), p.20&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Mogadishu came to be known as the "City of Islam"&lt;ref&gt;Brons, Maria (2003), ''Society, Security, Sovereignty and the State in Somalia: From Statelessness to Statelessness?'', p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; and controlled the East African gold trade for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, W.

During the [[Middle Ages]], several powerful empires dominated the regional trade in the Horn, including the [[Adal Sultanate]], the [[Ajuran Sultanate]], the [[Warsangali Sultanate]], the [[Zagwe dynasty]], and the [[Sultanate of the Geledi]].

The [[Sultanate of Showa]], established in 896, was one of the oldest local [[Islam]]ic states. It was centered in the former [[Shewa]] province in central Ethiopia. The polity was succeeded by the [[Sultanate of Ifat]] around 1285. Ifat was governed from its capital at [[Zeila]] in northern Somalia and was the easternmost district of the former Shewa Sultanate.&lt;ref name=C1&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nehemia Levtzion|author2=Randall Pouwels|title=The History of Islam in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1Ipt5A9mLMC&amp;pg=PA228|year=2000|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-8214-4461-0|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Adal Sultanate]] was a medieval multi-ethnic [[Muslim]] state centered in the Horn region. At its height, it controlled large parts of Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Eritrea. Many of the historic cities in the region, such as [[Amud]], [[Maduna]], [[Abasa, Somalia|Abasa]], [[Berbera]], [[Zeila]] and [[Harar]], flourished during the kingdom's golden age. This period that left behind numerous [[courtyard|courtyard houses]], [[mosque]]s, [[shrine]]s and [[defensive wall|walled enclosures]]. Under the leadership of rulers such as [[Sabr ad-Din II]], [[Mansur ad-Din of Adal|Mansur ad-Din]], [[Jamal ad-Din II]], [[Shams ad-Din ibn Muhammad|Shams ad-Din]], General [[Mahfuz]] and [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]], Adalite armies continued the struggle against the [[Solomonic dynasty]], a campaign historically known as the [[Abyssinian–Adal War|Conquest of Abyssinia]] or ''Futuh al Habash''.

The [[Warsangali Sultanate]] was a kingdom centered in northeastern and in some parts of southeastern Somalia. It was one of the largest sultanates ever established in the territory, and, at the height of its power, included the [[Sanaag]] region and parts of the northeastern [[Bari, Somalia|Bari]] region of the country, an area historically known as [[Maakhir]] or the ''[[Maakhir Coast]]''. The Sultanate was founded in the late 13th century in northern Somalia by a group of Somalis from the [[Warsangali]] branch of the [[Darod]] clan, and was ruled by the descendants of the [[Gerad Dhidhin]].

[[File:Gondereshe2008.jpg|thumb|left|The [[citadel]] in [[Gondershe]], an important city in the medieval [[Ajuran Sultanate]]]]

Through a strong centralized administration and an aggressive military stance towards invaders, the [[Ajuran Sultanate]] successfully resisted an [[Oromo people|Oromo]] invasion from the west and a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] incursion from the east during the Gaal Madow and the [[Ajuran Sultanate#Ajuran-Portuguese wars|Ajuran-Portuguese wars]]. Trading routes dating from the ancient and early medieval periods of [[Maritime history of Somalia|Somali maritime enterprise]] were also strengthened or re-established, and the state left behind an extensive [[Somali architecture|architectural legacy]]. Many of the hundreds of ruined castles and fortresses that dot the landscape of Somalia today are attributed to Ajuran engineers,&lt;ref&gt;Shaping of Somali Society pg 101&lt;/ref&gt; including a lot of the [[pillar tomb]] fields, [[necropolis]]es and ruined cities built during that era. The royal family, the House of Gareen, also expanded its territories and established its hegemonic rule through a skillful combination of warfare, trade linkages and alliances.&lt;ref&gt;Horn and Crescent: Cultural Change and Traditional Islam on the East African Coast, 800–1900 (African Studies) by Pouwels, Randall L.. pg 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zagwe dynasty]] ruled many parts of modern Ethiopia and Eritrea from approximately 1137 to 1270. The name of the dynasty comes from the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]]-speaking [[Agaw people]] of northern Ethiopia. From 1270 onwards for many centuries, the [[Solomonic dynasty]] ruled the [[Ethiopian Empire]].

[[File:Lalibela_Église_Bet_Giyorgis.JPG|thumb|The [[Lalibela]] churches carved by the [[Zagwe dynasty]] in the 12th century.]]

In the early 15th century, Ethiopia sought to make diplomatic contact with European kingdoms for the first time since Aksumite times. A letter from King [[Henry IV of England]] to the Emperor of Abyssinia survives.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mortimer, ''The Fears of Henry IV'' (2007), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; In 1428, the Emperor [[Yeshaq I of Ethiopia|Yeshaq]] sent two emissaries to [[Alfonso V of Aragon]], who sent return emissaries who failed to complete the return trip.&lt;ref name="Beshah"&gt;[[#Beshah|Beshah &amp; Aregay (1964)]], pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first continuous relations with a European country began in 1508 with Portugal under Emperor [[Dawit II of Ethiopia|Lebna Dengel]], who had just inherited the throne from his father.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beshah|Beshah &amp; Aregay (1964)]], p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This proved to be an important development, for when Abyssinia was subjected to the attacks of the [[Adal Sultanate]] General and [[Imam]] [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] (called "''Gurey''" or "''Grañ''", both meaning "the Left-handed"), Portugal assisted the Ethiopian emperor by sending weapons and four hundred men, who helped his son [[Gelawdewos of Ethiopia|Gelawdewos]] defeat Ahmad and re-establish his rule.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beshah|Beshah &amp; Aregay (1964)]], pp. 45–52.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Abyssinian–Adal War]] was also one of the first proxy wars in the region as the [[Ottoman Empire]], and Portugal took sides in the conflict.

[[File:Fasilides Palace 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fasilides of Ethiopia|King Fasilides's Castle]] in [[Gondar]]]]

When Emperor [[Susenyos of Ethiopia|Susenyos]] converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in 1624, years of revolt and civil unrest followed resulting in thousands of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beshah|Beshah &amp; Aregay (1964)]], pp. 91, 97–104.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries had offended the Orthodox faith of the local Ethiopians. On June 25, 1632, Susenyos's son, Emperor [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasilides]], declared the state religion to again be [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity]], and expelled the Jesuit missionaries and other Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beshah|Beshah &amp; Aregay (1964)]], p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Donzel, Emeri, "Fasilädäs" in Siegbert Uhlig, ed., ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha'' (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), p. 500.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the end of 18th and the beginning of 19th century the Yejju dynasty (more specifically, the Warasek) ruled north Ethiopia changing the official language of Amhara people to Afaan Oromo, including inside the court of Gondar which was capital of the empire. Founded by [[Ali I of Yejju]] several successive descendants of him and [[Abba Seru Gwangul]] ruled with their army coming from mainly their clan the [[Yejju Oromo tribe]] as well as Wollo and Raya Oromo.&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, Richard, ''The Ethiopian Royal Chronicles'', (London:Oxford University Press, 1967), pp. 139–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hobyo Sultanate Cavalry And Fort.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The [[Sultanate of Hobyo]]'s [[cavalry]] and fort]]

The [[Sultanate of the Geledi]] was a Somali kingdom administered by the Gobroon dynasty, which ruled parts of the Horn of Africa during the 18th and 19th centuries. It was established by the Ajuran soldier [[Ibrahim Adeer]], who had defeated various [[vassal]]s of the Ajuran Empire and established the ''House of Gobroon''. The [[dynasty]] reached its apex under the successive reigns of Sultan [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]], who successfully consolidated Gobroon power during the [[Bardera|Bardera wars]], and Sultan [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]], who forced regional powers such as the [[Oman|Omani Empire]] to submit [[tribute]].

The [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] (Migiurtinia) was another prominent Somali sultanate based in the Horn region. Ruled by [[Boqor|King]] [[Osman Mahamuud]] during its golden age, it controlled much of northeastern and central Somalia in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The polity had all of the organs of an integrated modern state and maintained a robust trading network. It also entered into treaties with foreign powers and exerted strong centralized authority on the domestic front.&lt;ref name="HOA"&gt;''Horn of Africa'', Volume 15, Issues 1–4, (Horn of Africa Journal: 1997), p.130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEAS"&gt;Michigan State University.

The [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] was a 19th-century Somali kingdom founded by Sultan [[Yusuf Ali Kenadid]]. Initially, Kenadid's goal was to seize control of the neighboring Majeerteen Sultanate, which was then ruled by his cousin Boqor Osman Mahamuud. However, he was unsuccessful in this endeavor, and was eventually forced into exile in [[Yemen]]. A decade later, in the 1870s, Kenadid returned from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] with a band of [[Hadhramaut|Hadhrami]] [[musketeer]]s and a group of devoted lieutenants. With their assistance, he managed to establish the kingdom of Hobyo, which would rule much of northeastern and central Somalia during the early modern period.&lt;ref name="Metz"&gt;Helen Chapin Metz, ''Somalia: a country study'', (The Division: 1993), p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period following the opening of the [[Suez canal]] in 1869, when European powers scrambled for territory in Africa and tried to establish [[coaling station]]s for their ships, Italy invaded and occupied [[Eritrea]]. On January 1, 1890, Eritrea officially became a colony of [[Italy]]. In 1896 further Italian incursion into the horn was decisively halted by Ethiopian forces. By 1936 however, Eritrea became a province of [[Italian East Africa]] (Africa Orientale Italiana), along with [[Ethiopia]] and [[Italian Somaliland]]. By 1941, Eritrea had about 760,000 inhabitants, including 70,000 Italians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Tesfagiorgis | first = Gebre Hiwet | title = Emergent Eritrea: challenges of economic development | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iuCBNoOpQyEC&amp;pg=PA111| publisher = The Red Sea Press | year = 1993 | page = 111 | isbn = 0-932415-91-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commonwealth armed forces, along with the Ethiopian patriotic resistance, expelled those of Italy in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statoids.com/uer.html Regions of Eritrea] (accessed Nov 17, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and took over the area's administration. The British continued to administer the territory under a [[UN Mandate]] until 1951, when Eritrea was federated with Ethiopia, as per UN resolution 390(A) and under the prompting of the United States adopted in December 1950.

The strategic importance of Eritrea, due to its Red Sea coastline and mineral resources, was the main cause for the federation with Ethiopia, which in turn led to Eritrea's annexation as Ethiopia's 14th province in 1952. This was the culmination of a gradual process of takeover by the Ethiopian authorities, a process which included a 1959 edict establishing the compulsory teaching of [[Amharic]], the main language of Ethiopia, in all Eritrean schools. The lack of regard for the Eritrean population led to the formation of an independence movement in the early 1960s (1961), which erupted into a [[Eritrean War of Independence|30-year war]] against successive Ethiopian governments that ended in 1991. Following a UN-supervised [[Eritrean independence referendum, 1993|referendum]] in Eritrea (dubbed [[UNOVER]]) in which the Eritrean people overwhelmingly voted for independence, Eritrea declared its independence and gained international recognition in 1993.&lt;ref name="Britannica_Eritrea-page20"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-37675/Eritrea |title=Eritrea – The spreading revolution |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Article |accessdate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, a border dispute with Ethiopia led to the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/12/07/news/eritrea.php Eritrea orders Westerners in UN mission out in 10 days].

From 1862 until 1894, the land to the north of the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]] situated in modern-day [[Djibouti]] was called ''Obock'' and was ruled by [[Somali people|Somali]] and [[Afar people|Afar]] [[Sultan]]s, local authorities with whom [[France]] signed various treaties between 1883 and 1887 to first gain a foothold in the region.&lt;ref name="Uwechue"&gt;Raph Uwechue, ''Africa year book and who's who'', (Africa Journal Ltd.: 1977), p.209.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Chisholm (ed.), ''The encyclopædia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information'', Volume 25, (At the University press: 1911), p.383.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Apcoatf"&gt;''A Political Chronology of Africa'', (Taylor &amp; Francis), p.132.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, [[Léonce Lagarde]] established a permanent French administration in the [[Djibouti (city)|city of Djibouti]] and named the region ''Côte française des Somalis'' ([[French Somaliland]]), a name which continued until 1967.

In 1958, on the eve of neighboring [[Somalia]]'s independence in 1960, a [[referendum]] was held in the territory to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, partly due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans.&lt;ref name=Barrington2006&gt;Barrington, Lowell, ''After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States'', (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p.115&lt;/ref&gt; There was also reports of widespread [[vote rigging]], with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shillington|Shillington (2005)]], p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of those who voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia, as had been proposed by [[Mahmoud Harbi]], Vice President of the Government Council.

This occupation lasted until 1941, and was replaced by a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[military administration]]. Northern Somalia would remain a [[protectorate]], while southern Somalia became a [[United Nations Trusteeship|trusteeship]]. The Union of the two regions in 1960 formed the Somali Republic. A civilian government was formed, and on July 20, 1961, through a popular [[referendum]], a new [[constitution]] that had first been drafted the year before was ratified.&lt;ref&gt;Greystone Press Staff, ''The Illustrated Library of The World and Its Peoples: Africa, North and East'', (Greystone Press: 1967), p.338.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Ethiopia and its current borders are a result of significant territorial reduction in the north and expansion in the east and south toward its present borders, owing to several migrations, commercial integration, treaties as well as conquests, particularly by [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Emperor Menelik II]] and [[Ras Gobena]].&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;John Young. "Regionalism and Democracy in Ethiopia" Third World Quarterly, Vol. 19, No. 2 (June 1998) pp. 192&lt;/ref&gt; From the central province of Shoa, Menelik set off to subjugate and incorporate ‘the lands and people of the South, East and West into an empire.’&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;the people subjugated and incorporated were the Oromo, Sidama, Gurage, Wolayta and other groups.

Keefer, International Journal of African Studies'' Vol. 6 No. 3 (1973) page 470''&lt;/ref&gt; Menelik had signed the Treaty of Wichale with Italy in May 1889, in which Italy would recognize Ethiopia’s sovereignty so long as Italy could control a small area of northern Tigray (part of modern Eritrea).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Negash|Negash (2005)]], pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; In return Italy, was to provide Menelik with arms and support him as emperor.&lt;ref name="Tekeste"&gt;[[#Negash|Negash (2005)]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italians used the time between the signing of the treaty and its ratification by the Italian government to further expand their territorial claims. Italy began a state funded program of resettlement for landless Italians in Eritrea, which increased tensions between the Eritrean peasants and the Italians.&lt;ref name="Tekeste"/&gt; This conflict erupted in the [[Battle of Adwa]] on 1 March 1896, in which Italy’s colonial forces were defeated by the Ethiopians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Negash|Negash (2005)]], p. 14, and ICG "Ethnic Federalism and its Discontents" pp 2; Italy lost over 4.600 nationals in this battle.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 20th century in Ethiopia was marked by the reign of Emperor [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie I]], who came to power after [[Iyasu V of Ethiopia|Iyasu V]] was deposed. In 1935, Haile Selassie's troops fought and lost the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], after which point Italy annexed Ethiopia to [[Italian East Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, Christopher, "Ḫaylä Śəllase" in Siegbert von Uhlig, ed., ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha'' (Wiesbaden:Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), pp. 1062–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Haile Selassie subsequently appealed to the [[League of Nations]], delivering an address that made him a worldwide figure and 1935's ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine Man of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Monday, Jan. 06, 1936 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,755559-1,00.html |title=Man of the Year |publisher=TIME |date=1936-01-06 |accessdate=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the entry of Italy into World War II, [[British Empire]] forces, together with patriot Ethiopian fighters, liberated Ethiopia in the course of the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, "Ḫaylä Śəllase", ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica'', p. 1063.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Senay.jpg|thumb|[[Addis Ababa]], capital of Ethiopia since 1886.]]

Haile Selassie's reign came to an end in 1974, when a Soviet-backed [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] [[military junta]], the [[Derg]] led by [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]], deposed him, and established a one-party [[communist state]], which was called the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]]. In July 1977, the [[Ogaden War]] broke out after the government of President of Somalia [[Siad Barre]] sought to incorporate the predominantly Somali-inhabited [[Ogaden]] region into a Pan-Somali [[Greater Somalia]]. By September 1977, the [[Military of Somalia|Somali army]] controlled 90% of the Ogaden, but was later forced to withdraw after Ethiopia's Derg received assistance from the [[USSR]], [[Cuba]], [[South Yemen]], [[East Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dagne | first = Haile Gabriel | title = The commitment of the German Democratic Republic in Ethiopia: a study based on Ethiopian sources | publisher = Lit; Global | year = 2006 | location = Münster, London | isbn = 978-3-8258-9535-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[North Korea]], including around 15,000 Cuban combat troops.

In 1989, the [[Tigrayan Peoples' Liberation Front]] (TPLF) merged with other ethnically based opposition movements to form the [[Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF), and eventually managed to overthrow Mengistu's dictatorial regime in 1991. A transitional government, composed of an 87-member Council of Representatives and guided by a national charter that functioned as a transitional constitution, was then set up. The first free and democratic election took place later in 1995, when Ethiopia's longest-serving Prime Minister [[Meles Zenawi]] was elected to office. As with other nations in the Horn region, Ethiopia maintained its historically close relations with countries in the Middle East during this period of change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethioembassy.org.uk/news_archive/EFP_ethio-yemen_relations.htm |title=Core Principles of Ethiopia’s Foreign Policy: Ethiopia-Yemen relations |publisher=Ethioembassy.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zenawi died in 2012, but his [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF) party remains the ruling political coalition in Ethiopia.

===Geology and climate===
[[File:horn of africa.jpg|thumb|The Horn of Africa as seen from the [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle]] in May 1993. The orange and tan colors in this image indicate a largely arid to semiarid climate.]]

The Horn of Africa is almost [[:wikt:equidistant|equidistant]] from the [[equator]] and the [[Tropic of Cancer]]. It consists chiefly of mountains uplifted through the formation of the [[Great Rift Valley (geographical concept)|Great Rift Valley]], a fissure in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] extending from [[Turkey]] to [[Mozambique]] and marking the separation of the African and Arabian [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. Mostly mountainous, the region arose through faults resulting from the Rift Valley.

Geologically, the Horn and [[Yemen]] once formed a single landmass around 18 million years ago, before the [[Gulf of Aden]] rifted and separated the Horn region from the [[Arabian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="Ranrestar"&gt;{{cite web|title=2007 Annual Report|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rrloageappabh"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Playing a Better Hand|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Somali Plate]] is bounded on the west by the East African Rift, which stretches south from the [[triple junction]] in the [[Afar Depression]], and an undersea continuation of the rift extending southward offshore. The northern boundary is the [[Aden Ridge]] along the coast of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The eastern boundary is the [[Central Indian Ridge]], the northern portion of which is also known as the [[Carlsberg Ridge]]. The southern boundary is the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]].

Extensive [[glacier]]s once covered the [[Simien Mountains|Simien]] and [[Bale Mountains]] but melted at the beginning of the [[Holocene]]. The mountains descend in a huge [[escarpment]] to the [[Red Sea]] and more steadily to the [[Indian Ocean]]. [[Socotra]] is a small island in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia. Its size is 3,600&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1,390&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi) and it is a territory of Yemen.

The [[lowland]]s of the Horn are generally arid in spite of their proximity to the equator. This is because the winds of the tropical [[monsoon]]s that give seasonal rains to the [[Sahel]] and the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] blow from the west. Consequently, they lose their moisture before reaching Djibouti and Somalia, with the result that most of the Horn receives little rainfall during the monsoon season.

[[File:Nasa Horn of Africa.JPG|thumb|left|The Horn of Africa. [[NASA]] image]]

In the mountains of Ethiopia, many areas receive over 2,000&amp;nbsp;mm (80&amp;nbsp;in) per year, and even [[Asmara]] receives an average of 570&amp;nbsp;mm (23&amp;nbsp;in). This rainfall is the sole source of water for many areas outside Ethiopia, including [[Egypt]]. In the winter, the northeasterly [[trade wind]]s do not provide any moisture except in mountainous areas of northern Somalia, where rainfall in late autumn can produce annual totals as high as 500&amp;nbsp;mm (20&amp;nbsp;in). On the eastern coast, a strong [[upwelling]] and the fact that the winds blow parallel to the coast means annual rainfall can be as low as 50&amp;nbsp;mm (2&amp;nbsp;in).

The climate in Ethiopia varies considerably between regions. It is generally hotter in the lowlands and temperate on the plateau. At [[Addis Ababa]], which ranges from  {{convert|2200|to|2600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, maximum temperature is {{convert|26|C|F|1}} and minimum {{convert|4|C|F|1}}. The weather is usually sunny and dry, but the short (''belg'') rains occur from February to April and the big (''meher'') rains from mid-June to mid-September. The [[Danakil Desert]] stretches across 100,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of arid terrain in northeast Ethiopia, southern Eritrea, and northwestern Djibouti. The area is known for its volcanoes and extreme heat, with daily temperatures over 45&amp;nbsp;°C and often surpassing 50&amp;nbsp;°C. It has a number of lakes formed by lava flows that dammed up several valleys. Among are Lake Asale (116 m below sea level) and Lake Giuletti/Afrera (80 m below sea level), both of which possess cryptodepressions in the [[Danakil Depression]]. The Afrera contains many active volcanoes, including the Maraho, [[Dabbahu Volcano|Dabbahu]], [[Afdera (volcano)|Afdera]] and [[Erta Ale]].&lt;ref name="Stobin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marco Stoppato|first1=Alfredo Bini|title=Deserts|date=2003|publisher=Firefly Books|isbn=1552976696|pages=160–163|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=huiIlEFSVukC|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Etpame"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Facts On File, Incorporated|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East|date=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=143812676X|page=7|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=stl97FdyRswC|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Somalia, there is not much seasonal variation in climate. Hot conditions prevail year-round along with periodic [[monsoon]] winds and irregular rainfall. Mean daily maximum temperatures range from {{convert|28|to|43|C|F}}, except at higher elevations along the eastern seaboard, where the effects of a cold offshore current can be felt. Somalia has only two permanent rivers, the [[Jubba River|Jubba]] and the [[Shebelle River|Shabele]], both of which begin in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]].&lt;ref name="Hadden"&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee. 2007.

===Ecology===
[[File:Common beisa oryx (Oryx beisa beisa) female.jpg|alt=|thumb|Oryx beisa beisa is found throughout the Horn of Africa]]
About 220 [[mammal]]s are found in the Horn of Africa. Among threatened [[species]] of the region, there are several [[antelope]]s such as the [[Beira (antelope)|beira]], the [[dibatag]], the [[silver dikdik]] and the [[Speke's gazelle]]. Other remarkable species include the [[Somali wild ass]], the [[desert warthog]], the [[hamadryas baboon]], the [[Somalia gerbil|Somali pygmy gerbil]], the [[ammodile]], and the [[gundi|Speke's pectinator]]. The [[Grevy's zebra]] is the unique wild [[Equidae|equid]] of the region. There are predators such as [[spotted hyena]], [[striped hyena]] and [[leopard|African leopard]]. The [[endangered]] [[painted hunting dog]] had populations in the Horn of Africa, but pressures from human exploitation of habitat along with warfare have reduced or extirpated this canid in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=info@globaltwitcher.com |url=http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=35993 |title=''Painted Hunting Dog: Lycaon pictus'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed.

Some important bird species of the Horn are the [[black boubou]], the [[golden-winged grosbeak]], the [[Warsangli linnet]], and the [[Djibouti francolin]].

The Horn of Africa holds more [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] [[reptile]]s than any other region in Africa, with over 285 species total and about 90 species which are found exclusively in the region. Among endemic reptile genera, there are ''[[Haackgreerius]]'', ''[[Haemodracon]]'', ''Ditypophis'', ''Pachycalamus'' and ''Aeluroglena''. Half of these genera are uniquely found on Socotra. Unlike reptiles, [[amphibian]]s are poorly represented in the region.

There are about 100 species of [[freshwater]] [[fish]] in the Horn of Africa, about 10 of which are endemic. Among the endemic, the cave-dwelling Somali blind barb and the Somali [[cavefish]] can be found.

[[File:Commiphora-myrrha-resin-myrrh.jpg|thumb|left|[[Myrrh]], a common resin in the Horn]]

It is estimated that about 5,000 species of [[vascular plant]]s are found in the Horn, about half of which are endemic. Endemism is most developed in Socotra and northern Somalia. The region has two endemic plant [[family (biology)|families]]: the [[Barbeyaceae]] and the [[Dirachmaceae]]. Among the other remarkable species, there are the cucumber tree found only on Socotra (''Dendrosicyos socotrana''), the Bankoualé palm, the [[Cordeauxia edulis|yeheb nut]], and the Somali [[cyclamen]].

Due to the Horn of Africa's [[semi-arid]] and [[arid]] climate, droughts are not uncommon. They are complicated by climate change and changes in agricultural practices. For centuries, the region's [[Pastoralism|pastoral groups]] have observed careful [[rangeland management]] practices to mitigate the effects of drought, such as avoiding overgrazing or setting aside land only for young or ill animals. However, population growth has put pressure on limited land and led to these practices no longer being maintained. Droughts in 1983–85, 1991–92, 1998–99 and 2011 have disrupted periods of gradual growth in herd numbers, leading to a decrease of between 37% and 62% of the cattle population. Initiatives by ECHO and USAID have succeeded in reclaiming hundreds of hectares of pastureland through rangeland management, leading to the establishment of the Dikale Rangeland in 2004.&lt;ref name="ODI 2009"&gt;Sara Pantuliano and Sara Pavanello (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3591&amp;title=drought-livelihoods-pastoralists-humanitarian Taking drought into account Addressing chronic vulnerability among pastoralists in the Horn of Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307103951/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3591&amp;title=drought-livelihoods-pastoralists-humanitarian |date=2012-03-07 }} [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnicity and languages==

The countries of the Horn of Africa have been the birthplace of many ancient, as well as modern, cultural achievements in several fields including agriculture, architecture, art, cuisine, education, literature, music, technology and theology.

Ethiopian agriculture established the earliest known use of the seed grass [[teff]] (''Poa abyssinica'') between 4000–1000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=16-ejysyRCgC&amp;pg |title=The Agricultural Systems of the World |author= David B.

The Horn has produced numerous indigenous writing systems. Among these is [[Ge'ez script]] ({{lang|gez|ግዕዝ}} ''{{transl|sem|Gəʿəz}}'') (also known as ''Ethiopic''), which has been written in for at least 2000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Rodolfo Fattovich, "Akkälä Guzay" in Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A-C''. Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz KG, 2003, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[abugida]] script that was originally developed to write the [[Ge'ez language]]. In speech communities that use it, such as the Amharic and Tigrinya, the script is called ''{{transl|sem|fidäl}}'' ({{lang|gez|ፊደል}}), which means "script" or "alphabet".
[[File:Ciismaniya.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Osmanya]] writing script]]
In the early 20th century, in response to a national campaign to settle on a writing script for the [[Somali language]] (which had long since lost its ancient script&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Information and National Guidance, Somalia, ''The writing of the Somali language'', (Ministry of Information and National Guidance: 1974), p.5&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Osman Yusuf Kenadid]], a Somali poet and remote cousin of the [[Sultan]] [[Yusuf Ali Keenadid|Yusuf Ali Kenadid]] of the [[Sultanate of Hobyo]], devised a phonetically sophisticated alphabet called [[Osmanya script|Osmanya]] (also known as ''far soomaali''; Osmanya: 𐒍𐒖𐒇 𐒈𐒝𐒑𐒛𐒐𐒘) for representing the sounds of Somali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of African Biography: Abach - Brand, Volume 1|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195382072|page=357|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA357|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though no longer the official writing script in Somalia, the Osmanya script is available in the [[Unicode]] range 10480-104AF [from U+10480 – U+104AF (66688–66735)].

The Somali writer [[Nuruddin Farah]] has also garnered acclaim as perhaps the most celebrated writer ever to come out of the Horn of Africa. Having published many short stories, novels and essays, Farah's prose has earned him, among other accolades, the [[Premio Cavour]] in Italy, the [[Kurt Tucholsky Prize]] in Sweden, and in 1998, the prestigious [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]]. In the same year, the French edition of his novel ''Gifts'' also won the St. Malo Literature Festival's prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lettre-ulysses-award.org/authors03/farah.html |title=Lettre Ulysses Award for the Art of Reportage – Nuruddin Farah |publisher=Lettre-ulysses-award.org |date=2011-12-09 |accessdate=2013-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Music of Ethiopia|music of the Ethiopian]] highlands uses a unique [[musical mode|modal system]] called ''qenet'', of which there are four main modes: ''tezeta'', ''bati'', ''[[Ambassel scale|ambassel]]'', and ''anchihoy''.&lt;ref name=Grove356&gt;{{NewGrove2001|article=Ethiopia|last=Shelemay|first=Kay Kaufman|vol=viii|pages=356}}&lt;!-- This citation is specific to a specific author and page number --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Three additional modes are variations on the above: tezeta minor, bati major, and bati minor.&lt;ref name="Barihun"&gt;[[Abatte Barihun]], liner notes for the album [[Ras Deshen (album)|Ras Deshen]], 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Some songs take the name of their qenet, such as tezeta, a song of reminiscence.&lt;ref name=Grove356 /&gt;

In the field of technology, the Great Stele of [[Axum]], at over {{convert|100|ft|m}} long, was the largest single stone ever quarried in the [[ancient world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/um/umn.html University of Alabama www.hp.uab.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331192826/http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/um/umn.html |date=2009-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:Ark of the Covenant church in Axum Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|The Chapel of the Tablet at the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] allegedly houses the original [[Ark of the Covenant]].]]

Most inhabitants in the Horn of Africa follow one of the three major [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] faiths. These religions have had a longstanding adherence in the region.

The ancient Axumite Kingdom produced coins and stelae associated with the disc and crescent symbols of the deity [[Astar (god)|Ashtar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roland Anthony Oliver|author2=Brian M. Fagan|title=Africa in the Iron Age: C.500 BC-1400 AD|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5qYNSRjqacC|year=1975|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-09900-4|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom later became one of the earliest states to adopt [[Christianity]], following the conversion of King [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana II]] in the 4th century.

[[File:Fakr Ud Din Mosque.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving of the 13th-century [[Fakr ad-Din Mosque]] built by Fakr ad-Din, the first [[Sultan of Mogadishu]]]]

Islam was introduced to the northern Somali coast early on from the [[Arabian peninsula]], shortly after the [[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]. [[Zeila]]'s two-[[mihrab]] [[Masjid al-Qiblatayn (Somalia)|Masjid al-Qiblatayn]] dates to the 7th century, and is the oldest [[mosque]] in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="Btgpb"&gt;{{cite book|last=Briggs|first=Phillip|title=Somaliland|year=2012|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=1841623717|page=7|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=M6NI2FejIuwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aymar"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fauvelle-Aymar|first=François-Xavier|title=Le port de Zeyla et son arrière-pays au Moyen Âge: Investigations archéologiques et retour aux sources écrites|url=https://www.academia.edu/1202629/Le_port_de_Zeyla_et_son_arriere-pays_au_Moyen_Age_Investigations_archeologiques_et_retour_aux_sources_ecrites|publisher=Livre Islam|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 9th century, [[Al-Yaqubi]] wrote that [[Muslim]]s were living along the northern Somali seaboard.&lt;ref name="Encyamer"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 25|year=1965|publisher=Americana Corporation|pages=255|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OP5LAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentioned that the Adal kingdom had its capital in the city,&lt;ref name="Encyamer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewispohoa"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=I.M.|title=Peoples of the Horn of Africa: Somali, Afar and Saho|year=1955|publisher=International African Institute|pages=140|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cd0mAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the Adal Sultanate with Zeila as its headquarters dates back to at least the 9th or 10th century. According to I.M. Lewis, the polity was governed by local [[Somali people|Somali]] [[dynasty|dynasties]], who also ruled over the similarly-established [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]] in the littoral [[Benadir]] region to the south. Adal's history from this founding period forth would be characterized by a succession of battles with neighbouring [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]].&lt;ref name="Lewispohoa"/&gt;

[[Islam]] was introduced to the region early on from the [[Arabian peninsula]], shortly after the [[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]. At [[Muhammad]]'s urging, a band of persecuted Muslims had fled across the Red Sea into the Horn. There, the [[Muslim]]s were granted protection by the Aksumite King [[Aṣḥama ibn Abjar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+so0014) |title=A Country Study: Somalia from The Library of Congress |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Judaism]] has a long presence in the region. The ''[[Kebra Negast]]'' ("Book of the Glory of Kings") relates that Israelite tribes arrived in Ethiopia with [[Menelik&amp;nbsp;I]], purported to be the son of King [[Solomon]] and the [[Queen of Sheba]] (Makeda). The legend relates that Menelik as an adult returned to his father in [[Jerusalem]], and then resettled in Ethiopia, and that he took with him the [[Ark of the Covenant]].&lt;ref&gt;''Budge, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/kn/  ''Queen of Sheba''], ''Kebra Negast, chap. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Beta Israel]] today primarily follow the Orit (from Aramaic "Oraita" – "[[Torah]]"), which consists of the [[Torah|Five Books of Moses]] and the books [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]] and [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]].

A number of ethnic minority groups in southern Ethiopia also adhere to various [[African traditional religion|traditional faiths]]. Among these belief systems are the Nilo-Saharan [[Surma people]]'s acknowledgment of the [[sky god]] ''[[Tumu (god)|Tumu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aparna Rao|author2=Michael Bollig|author3=Monika Böck|title=The Practice of War: Production, Reproduction and Communication of Armed Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trnATFcxvKwC|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-280-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
[[File:Bekele vs Farah.jpg|alt=|thumb|Bekele vs Farah, London 2012, The Olympic Games]]
In the modern era, the Horn of Africa has produced several world-famous sports personalities, including long distance runners such as the world-record holder [[Kenenisa Bekele]] and [[Derartu Tulu]], the first Ethiopian woman to win an Olympic gold medal and the only woman to have twice won the 10,000 meter Olympic gold in the short history of the event.
One of the most successful runners from the region has been [[Haile Gebrselassie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Athlete Profile Haile Gebrselassie |url=http://www.iaaf.org/athletes/biographies/letter=0/athcode=8774/index.html |title=Gebrselassie Haile page on www.iaaf.org |publisher=Iaaf.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was acclaimed as "[[Athlete of the Year]] 1998" by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF). As well as numerous gold medals in various events, Gebrselassie achieved 15 [[world records]] and world bests in long and middle distance running, including world record [[marathon]] times in 2007 and 2008. Somali athlete [[Abdi Bile]] became a world champion when he won the 1500m for men at the [[1987 World Championships in Athletics]], running the final 800m of the race in 1:46.0, the fastest final 800m of any 1,500 meter track race in history.

Eritrea has established the cycling event the [[Tour of Eritrea]].

In recent years, the [[Somali diaspora]] produced a football star in [[Ayub Daud]], a midfielder who plays for [[Juventus]] in Italy's [[Serie A]]. [[Zahra Bani]], a Somali-Italian [[javelin throw]]er, has garnered attention with her performances that so far have earned her adopted Italy a silver medal at the [[2005 Mediterranean Games]], as has [[Mo Farah]], a Somali-British athlete that took gold for his adopted Great Britain in the 3000m at the 2009 [[European Indoor Championships in Athletics|European Indoor Championships]] in [[Turin]] and later golds in both the 10,000m and 5,000m at the 2012 London Olympics.

==Economy==
[[File:Coffee beans ethiopia culture africa fabric.jpg|alt=|thumb|Coffee beans from Ethiopia]]&lt;!-- Maryland is not in the Horn --&gt;

According to the IMF, in 2010 the Horn of Africa region had a total GDP (PPP) of $106.224 billion and nominal of $35.819 billion.

States of the region depend largely on a few key [[export]]s:
* [[Economy of Ethiopia]]: Coffee 80% of total exports.
* [[Economy of Somalia]]: [[Banana]]s and [[livestock]] over 50% of total exports.
Over 95% of cross-border trade within the region is unofficial and undocumented, carried out by pastoralists trading livestock.&lt;ref name="ODI 2010"/&gt; The unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep and goats from [[Ethiopia]] sold to other countries in the Horn and the wider Eastern Africa region, including [[Somalia]] and [[Djibouti]], generates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million annually (100 times more than the official figure).&lt;ref name="ODI 2010"&gt;Pavanello, Sara 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4997&amp;title=working-across-borders-harnessing-potential-cross-border-activities-improve-livelihood-security-horn-africa-drylands Working across borders – Harnessing the potential of cross-border activities to improve livelihood security in the Horn of Africa drylands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112224025/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4997&amp;title=working-across-borders-harnessing-potential-cross-border-activities-improve-livelihood-security-horn-africa-drylands |date=2010-11-12 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote regional integration.&lt;ref name="ODI 2010"/&gt; However, there are also risks as the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allow disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, governments are unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.&lt;ref name="ODI 2010"/&gt;

Much of the Horn nations' trade links are with Middle Eastern countries. In 2011, an event hosted by the [[Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies]] in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]] devoted several days of discussion to ways in which countries in the Horn region and the adjacent Arabian peninsula could further strengthen these historically close economic, social, cultural and religious ties.&lt;ref name="Dthoaiopittaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.dohainstitute.org/content/ea5b0af1-d809-4a4b-b651-cdf324125fc8 |title="Arabs and the Horn of Africa" Kicking off November 27, 2011 |location=daho |publisher=English.dohainstitute.org |date=2011-11-21|accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Integrated geography''' (also referred to as '''integrative geography''',&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaas Auup oooo. Rupke (2008): ''Alexander Von Humboldt: A Metabiography''. [[Chicago]]: [[University of Chicago Press]]. {{ISBN|9780226731490}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''environmental geography''' or '''human–environment geography''') is the branch of [[geography]] that describes and explains the [[spatial analysis|spatial]] aspects of interactions between human individuals or societies and their natural environment,&lt;ref&gt;Noel Castree ''et al.'' (2009): ''A Companion to Environmental Geography''. [[London]]: [[Wiley-Blackwell]]. {{ISBN|9781444305739}}&lt;/ref&gt; these interactions being called [[coupled human–environment system]]s.

== Origins ==
It requires an understanding of the dynamics of [[physical geography]], as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment ([[human geography]]). Thus, to a certain degree, it may be seen as a successor of ''Physische Anthropogeographie'' (English: "physical anthropogeography")—a term coined by [[University of Vienna]] geographer [[Albrecht Penck]] in 1924&lt;ref&gt;Karlheinz Paffen (1959): Stellung und Bedeutung der Physischen Anthropogeographie. In: ''[[Erdkunde]]'' 13 (4), pp. 354–372. [https://dx.doi.org/10.3112/erdkunde.1959.04.08 DOI: 10.3112/erdkunde.1959.04.08]&lt;/ref&gt;—and geographical [[Cultural ecology|cultural]] or [[human ecology]] (Harlan H. Barrows 1923). Integrated geography in the United States is principally influenced by the schools of [[Carl O. Sauer]] (Berkeley), whose perspective was rather historical, and [[Gilbert F. White]] (Chicago), who developed a more applied view.
Integrated geography (also, integrative geography, environmental geography or human–environment geography) is the branch of geography that describes and explains the spatial aspects of interactions between human individuals or societies and their natural environment, called  [[coupled human–environment system]]s.

== Focus ==
[[File:Finley wildlife refuge.jpg|thumb|Wildlife refuge located in Oregon, United States.]]
The links between human and physical geography were once more apparent than they are today. As human experience of the world is increasingly mediated by technology, the relationships between humans and the environment have often become obscured. Thereby, integrated geography represents a critically important set of analytical tools for assessing the impact of human presence on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. This is done by measuring the result of human activity on natural landforms and cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garcia|first1=Hector|title=Environmental Geography|date=2010|publisher=Apple Academic Press, Inc.|isbn=1926686683}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods for which this information is gained include [[remote sensing]], and [[geographic information system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/921583361|title=An introduction to human-environment geography : local dynamics and global processes|last=G.|first=Moseley, William|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781405189316|oclc=921583361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated geography helps us to ponder the environment in terms of its relationship to people. With integrated geography we can analyze different social science and humanities perspectives and their use in understanding people environment processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Human-Environment Geography|last=Moseley|first=William G.|last2=Perramond|first2=Eric|last3=Hapke|first3=Holly M.|last4=Laris|first4=Paul|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, it is considered the third branch of geography,&lt;ref&gt;David Demeritt (2009): From externality to inputs and interference: framing environmental research in geography. In: ''Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers'' 34 (1), pp. 3–11, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-5661.2008.00333.x DOI: 10.1111/j.1475-5661.2008.00333.x.]&lt;/ref&gt; the other branches being physical and human geography. &lt;ref&gt;Arild Holt-Jensen (1999): ''Geography - History and Concepts: A Student's Guide''.

'''Ada Jessamine Shumate''' (born on March 31, 1902 as '''Ada Jessamine White''' in [[Horsepasture, Virginia]] – died on December 16, 1990 in [[Greenville, North Carolina]]) was an [[United States|American]] artist, historian and cartographer, winner of the "Award of Distinction" in 1955 from the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]].

==Work==
Jessamine Shumate worked within a number of different styles and media during her career. "Her work covers a broad range of media including silk [[screen-printing]], [[pastel]], transparent and opaque water color, oil, collage, batik and serigraph.  Some of her techniques involve oil and the use of a blowtorch. She uses her serigraphs and silk screens as part of her collage work. Mrs. Shumate also makes photographic prints of her original work."&lt;ref&gt;"Mrs. Shumate will have Art Exhibited." 1971. Daily Southerner of Tarboro, NC. No page number or exact date is given.&lt;/ref&gt; She did traditional portraits; still life; traditional bucolic and rural scenes of Virginia and landscapes. She also completed a number of [[abstract art]] works, using cubism, [[orientalism]] and [[found object]] art. However, during her time, she lived in artistic isolation. In southwestern Virginia, there were few other professional artists, and fewer people to discuss and exchange artistic ideas with. Those artists in the southwestern Virginia area during the 1940s and 1950s, were frequently very conservative in their tastes. They often concentrated only on traditional southern art paintings, such as family portraits, landscapes, or simply decorating utensils. Few other people in the region had the scope and range of Jessamine Shumate's efforts, and she received much local criticism and disapproval for some of her modern art projects and accomplishments. She was also a founder of what is now called the [[Piedmont Arts Association]] in Martinsville, Virginia.

A still controversial series of art works was done showing the Broad Street Christian Church in Martinsville, Virginia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadstreetchristian.com/|title=Broad Street Christian Church|publisher=Broadstreetchristian.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which she was a member. Margaret Hadden said: "Her church, Broad Street Christian Church, in Martinsville, was very important to her and she taught the kindergarten class in Sunday school for many years."&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Margaret S. 2007. My Memoirs. Page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In this series of experiments, she did one oil painting of the outside of the church in the cubist style (See: [[Cubism]]), showing an abstract view of the church from different sides simultaneously. In another two pastels, she shows the light of the stained glass windows filling the inside of the sanctuary and coming forth out from the church, and illuminating the area around the church, passing through the brick walls.

Another two works were done in [[watercolor painting]] of the [[Philpott Dam]] in Henry County. These were done during the construction phase of the dam, and both paintings show the temporary cement factory that was constructed to make the cement locally, and then taken down and removed after the dam was constructed. Her paintings are the only representations from this period, since most other photographic work concentrated on the construction of the dam itself, and not in the engineering aspects of the construction site. These paintings have recently been given to the Philpott Dam. "Relatives of the late artist Ada Jessamine Shumate, who contributed two of her paintings of the construction of Philpott Dam to the dam's visitor's center. Shumate was a native of Henry County who painted the construction during the 1950s. Sharing the paintings with the public is a fitting tribute to her work and a good way for people to get a sense of what went into creating the dam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hats Off To...  |url=https://www.martinsvillebulletin.com/news/local/philpott-dam-construction-paintings-given-to-center/article_44335269-3e9b-5361-824d-bf3769848b7a.html|publisher=Martinsville Bulletin |date=September 26, 2010 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another article commented: "Relatives of the late artist Ada Jessamine Shumate, who contributed two of her paintings of the construction of Philpott Dam to the dam's visitor's center. Shumate was a native of Henry County who painted the construction during the 1950s. Sharing the paintings with the public is a fitting tribute to her work and a good way for people to get a sense of what went into creating the dam."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.martinsvillebulletin.com/opinion/hats-off-to/article_654d6bd2-1968-5335-bd50-30d12a713d17.html Hats off to ...]" [[Martinsville Bulletin]]. September 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another series of paintings were done when she was a student at the Woman's College in Greensboro, North Carolina, now the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]]. Some of these paintings show a cubist style of the gym and other buildings, showing images of the past and present brought together, so older buildings appear to overlap newer construction. Other paintings are pastels showing scenes of student housing and life in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] from the late 1940s.

Jessamine Shumate was also famous for some of her unusual works. One of the most interesting was a burned cookie sheet. "Mrs. Jessamine Shumate... is perhaps the only local artist to use a burned cookie sheet and a blow torch to do some of her painting."&lt;ref&gt;" Smith, Rodney. 1967. "Cookie Sheet and Blow Torch are used in Art Work by Mrs. Jessamine Shumate." The Henry County Journal. December 20, 1967, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; And another writer from Roanoke said: "When it come to experimental material it is quite possible that Jessamine Shumate takes some kind of cake for painting on a cookie sheet. For me this is actually one of the most delightful items in the show. No one would guess that her bright, "Pebbly Abstract No. 3" is the result of a near kitchen disaster. Jim Yeatts, gallery owner, tells us that the artist left the cookie tin in the oven too long one day and tried desperately to get it clean. When it didn't begin to shine properly, she decided to paint it and frame it. "Cookie Sheet", done in "mixed media", is a delightful addition to the show. It may also be some sort of inspiration to other kitchen artists, who prefer paint brushes to scouring pads."&lt;ref&gt;Young, Priscilla. "Art for All: Mrs. Shumate's New Experiments." Roanoke Times. 1963. No pagination or exact date given.&lt;/ref&gt; The art piece is an example of "[[found object]] art", in that it is presented by the artist as a work of art, but the object was originally designed for a non-art function. Jessamine Shumate had taken something that was "found" and made it into another, more artistic, representation.

Jessamine Shumate has shown her works in the art museums of [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]]; the [[Taubman Museum of Art]] in [[Roanoke, Virginia]]; [[Bristol, Tennessee]], the Greenville Museum of Art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmoa.org/|title=Greenville Museum of Art :: Home|publisher=Gmoa.org|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[Greenville, North Carolina]], [[Tarboro, North Carolina]], the art museum of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] and others.

==Life==
Jessamine Shumate was born to a tradesman and general store owner in [[Horsepasture, Virginia]], Nathan Mortimer White and Ada Bassett White, who was an elementary school truant officer.  Her father was quite the country scientist and shade tree inventor, and she said of him in her autobiography, "Another memory is going with my father to the barn each night to feed the animals there. In 1910, when [[Halley's Comet]] was seen, we watched for it and he told me all about it as we walked to the barn. He was very interested in scientific happenings and nature, and I was fascinated by the sight! What a thrill to know I had lived long enough to see Halley's Comet again in 1986. This time, however, the sight was not as wonderful!  Even the scientists were disappointed in the display of Halley's Comet's tail. The next time around, I suppose my great grandchildren will be here to see the comet."&lt;ref&gt;"Ada Jessamine Shumate" IN: Hadden, Robert Lee. 1990. The Shamrock and the Fleur de Lys: the Family Histories of the William James Hadden family and the Whitney Shumate Family. Page 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a younger woman, she had never painted seriously, but said she had always wanted to. She had taught art at of the higher grade classes in my school. While her youngest daughter was enrolled in [[Lynchburg College]], she decided to drive to Lynchburg every week and take some art courses there. She enjoyed the classes, and later she went to Women's College in Greensboro, North Carolina, now known as the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]], to take more advanced art classes. She also attended some courses at the [[Art Students League of New York]].  Every month during the school session, she would ride the train to New York City and stay for a week. She learned a great deal from these classes, and enjoyed her painting and experimenting with many different kinds of medium.

She married [[Whitney Shumate]] on December 13, 1922.  She said in her autobiography, "While I was going to school in Martinsville, I met a young man named Whitney Shumate. We started dating and went together for three years before we were married. The family teased me, because Whitney had a large car and when he came to Preston, Virginia to visit, always took me and a few members of my family for rides. When he bought a coupe, everyone said he was getting serious and wanted to leave my family at home when he took me for rides! It must have been true, because we were married on December 13, 1922."&lt;ref&gt;"Ada Jessamine Shumate" IN: Hadden, Robert Lee. 1990. The Shamrock and the Fleur de Lys: the Family Histories of the William James Hadden family and the Whitney Shumate Family. Page 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitney and Jessamine Shumate had two daughters, Ada Margaret S. Hadden (Mrs. [[William J. Hadden]]) and Jessamine "Jeppy" White S. Calhoun. Her grandson, [[Whit Haydn]], is a noted magician and entertainer.

==Awards==

==Major works==
* ''Historical Map of Virginia'', copyright 1959. Silk screen (see: [[Screen-printing]]). Completed in 1959, this large map shows local history, important families and their coats of arms, and other features from Virginia's four hundred years of Colonial and American history. This map took over 27 silk screens to print, and each one was hand corrected. Each copy says: "The Artist weeps and heaps piles of ashes on her head if your coat of arms is not on this map. Put it in the blank shield in the top left corner."
* ''Historical Map of [[Henry County, Virginia]]'' and a separate broadside chronology of local history. Copyright 1957. "The cover of 'Our Proud Heritage' is reproduced from a silk screen print made by Mrs. Jessamine Shumate, of Martinsville." The map and chronology are both available at the University of Virginia, Special Collections Library, in Charlottesville, VA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogy.com/users/p/a/r/Sally-G-Parker/FILE/0004page.html |title=Our Proud Heritage: A Pictorial History of Martinsville and Henry County, Virginia" Produced and printed by the Bassett Printing Corp. |location=Bassett, Virginia.

* ''Historical Map of [[Guilford County, North Carolina]]'' Using a silk screened process, this 1959 map showed the position and shape of the county, as well as local events, such as the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]], and other local history. Copyright 1959. A copy of this map is available at the [[University of Virginia]], Special Collections Library, in Charlottesville, VA.
* ''Historical Map of [[Pitt County, North Carolina]]'', copyright 1968. This is also available as a serigraph, along with a printed chronology of the county. The map and a separate broadside chronology are available at the Sheppard Memorial Library, Local History Collection, in [[Greenville, North Carolina]]. Copies are also available for viewing at the [[University of Virginia]], Special Collections Department of the Alderman Library, in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].
* ''Composition'', copyright 1965. This was one of her favorites, and is an abstract composition of shapes in gray, yellow and red. She made a number of prints of this painting.
* ''Wind in New York'' This is a study in black and white, and shows the impressive winds that could blow between the skyscrapers of New York. When Jessamine Shumate was attending art school in [[New York City]], a gust of wind was so powerful that it picked her up and blew her against a taxicab. This event is also shown in this study.

'''Johannes Stabius''' ('''Johann Stab''') (1450–1522) was an [[Austria]]n [[cartographer]] of [[Vienna]] who developed, around 1500, the heart-shape (cordiform) projection map later developed further by [[Johannes Werner]].  It is called the ''[[Werner map projection]]'', but also the '''Stabius-Werner''' or the '''Stab-Werner''' projection.    

After its introduction by Werner in his 1514 book, ''Nova translatio primi libri geographiaae C. Ptolemaei'', the ''Werner projection'' was commonly used for world [[map]]s and some continental maps through the 16th century and into the 17th century.  It was used by [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]], [[Oronce Fine]], and [[Ortelius]] in the late 16th century for maps of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].  By the 18th century, it was replaced by the ''[[Bonne projection]]'' for continental maps. The ''Werner projection'' is only used today for instructional purposes and as a novelty.

In 1512, Stabius published a work called the ''Horoscopion''.  He also devised a card dial.[https://web.archive.org/web/20090201174822/http://www.dse.nl/~zonnewijzer/regiom.htm]   

Stabius was a member of a circle of [[humanism|humanists]] based in Vienna.  This circle included the scholars [[Georg Tannstetter]], [[Stiborius]], [[Thomas Resch]],  [[Stefan Rosinus]], [[Johannes Cuspinianus]], and the reformer [[Joachim Vadianus]].  These humanists were associated with the court of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]].[http://www.univie.ac.at/archiv/tour/7.htm]

'''Julius Büdel''' (8 August 1903 – 28 August 1983) was a [[German people|German]] [[geomorphologist]] noted for his work on the influence of climate in shaping landscapes and [[landform]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work Büdel stressed the importance of [[relict (geology)|inherited landforms]] in present-day landscapes and argued that many landforms are the result of a combination of processes, and not of a single process.&lt;ref name=Migon2006/&gt; Büdel estimated that 95% of [[mid-latitude]] landforms are relict.&lt;ref name=Sarre1993a&gt;{{cite book |last=Sarre |first=R.D. |date=1993 |chapter=Climatic geomorphology |chapter-url=https://books.google.fi/books?id=6uchDIKQV0UC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22Peritropical+zone+of+excessive+planation%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n4rwR-esfY&amp;sig=eJyN50pe41wIm6SUP8Wqy0Sck0Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Peritropical%20zone%20of%20excessive%20planation%22&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of the Solid Earth Sciences|editor-last=Kearey|editor-first=Philip |location= |publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd. |page=112–114 |isbn=0-632-03699-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Migon2006/&gt; Büdel studied both [[periglacial|cold-climate]] processes in [[Svalbard]] and "tropical" [[weathering]] processes in [[India]] to understand the origin of the relief of [[Central Europe]], which he argued was a [[Palimpsest (geology)|palimpsest]] of landforms formed at different times and under different climates.&lt;ref name=Migon2006/&gt; For Central Europe Büdel concluded that in [[Late Cretaceous]] to [[Early Pliocene]] times [[etchplain]]s formed. Then in Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene times a transition period occurred in landscape forming processes. Finally in the Late Pleistocene [[periglaciation]] and deep [[permafrost]] made Central Europe a place of "excessive valley cutting". Holocene developments would not have affected much of the landscape other than adding a deep soil cover.&lt;ref name=Sarre1993b&gt;{{cite book |last=Sarre |first=R.D. |date=1993 |chapter=Climato-genetic geomorphology |chapter-url=https://books.google.fi/books?id=6uchDIKQV0UC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22Peritropical+zone+of+excessive+planation%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n4rwR-esfY&amp;sig=eJyN50pe41wIm6SUP8Wqy0Sck0Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Peritropical%20zone%20of%20excessive%20planation%22&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of the Solid Earth Sciences|editor-last=Kearey|editor-first=Philip |location= |publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd. |page=114 |isbn=0-632-03699-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his life Büdel published three influential morphoclimatic zoning schemes. The first, in 1948, was followed by another in 1963, and a final version in 1977.&lt;ref name=Gutix2&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285964375_Climatic_Geomorphology|chapter=Climatic Geomorphology|title=Treatise on Geomorphology|volume=13|author-last=Gutiérrez|first=Mateo |last2=Gutiérrez|first2=Francisco|year=2013|pages=115–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Büdel's schemes emphasise [[planation surface|planation]] and [[river incision|valley-cutting]] in relation to climate, arguing that valley-cutting is dominant in subpolar regions while planation is so in the tropics.&lt;ref name=Sarre1993a/&gt;

Much of Büdel's 1977 book ''Klima-geomorphologie'' was considered outdated as of 2006. However its pioneering approaches make it a classic in geomorphological literature.&lt;ref name=Migon2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Migoń |first1=Piotr |author-link=Piotr Migoń |first2= |date=2006 |title=Büdel, J. 1982: Climatic geomorphology.

The '''Liesbeek River''' (also spelt '''Liesbeeck''') is a river in [[Cape Town]] in [[South Africa]].  It is named after a small river in the Netherlands. The first "free burghers" of the [[Dutch East India Company]] were granted land to farm along the river in 1657, shortly after the first Dutch settlers arrived in the Cape.  The river was originally called the Amstel or Versse Rivier. It is the first river that [[Jan van Riebeeck]] named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riversoftheworld.org/files/11875 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215182914/http://www.riversoftheworld.org/files/11875 |archivedate=2011-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liesbeek, which is less than {{convert|9|km|abbr=on}} long, is situated in the oldest urbanised river valley in South Africa. The headwaters flow from the eastern slopes of [[Table Mountain]] above [[Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens]] where the vegetation is largely indigenous. The slopes of [[Bishopscourt, Cape Town|Bishopscourt]] have large properties, including Jan van Riebeeck's farm. Water abstraction occurs here, often to water residential gardens, causing the flow to reduce during the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riversoftheworld.org/files/11875&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Newlands, Cape Town|Newlands]], there are smaller residential plots. South African Breweries and the Josephine Mill are located here. From [[Rondebosch]], large sections of the river are canalised, and the short sections of the river that are not canalised are degraded by erosion as a consequence of the increased flow from the canalised sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riversoftheworld.org/files/11875 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215182914/http://www.riversoftheworld.org/files/11875 |archivedate=2011-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below [[Rosebank, Cape Town|Rosebank]] and [[Mowbray, Cape Town|Mowbray]], at [[Observatory, Cape Town|Observatory]], is the confluence of the Liesbeek and [[Black River (Cape Town)|Black Rivers]]. The Two Rivers Urban Park is located on land between the Liesbeek and the Black with heritage sites and designated public open spaces. The Liesbeek empties into [[Table Bay]] at [[Paarden Eiland]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riversoftheworld.org/files/11875&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liesbeeck is home to the [[African clawed frog|Platanna]], or African clawed frog, an amphibian that has been important in certain areas of medical research.

'''Lilla Värtan''' ({{lang-sv|Smaller Värtan}}) or simply '''Värtan''' is a [[strait]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].  Separating mainland Stockholm from the island and municipality [[Lidingö]], it stretches from [[Blockhusudden]] in the south to [[Stora Värtan]] in the north, and is joined by the [[Stocksundet]] mid-way. Two bridges, collectively called [[Lidingöbron]] ("Lidingö Bridge") stretch over the strait.

While most of the coasts surrounding the strait are occupied by industries and the ferry terminals and oil tanks in the harbour area of [[Värtahamnen]], natural beaches are found in both the southern and the northern end of the strait and the strait forms part of the [[Royal National City Park]].&lt;ref name="vattenvard-htaml"&gt;{{cite web

Most common fish species are Baltic [[herring]], [[sea trout]], and [[salmon]]. Stationary predator fishes, e.g. [[northern pike]] and [[perch]], are exposed to raised levels of [[mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref name="vattenvard-htaml" /&gt;

The area is considered an important wintering location for several birds species, including [[swan]]s, [[Eurasian coot]], [[common pochard]], [[tufted duck]], [[black-headed gull]], [[lesser black-backed gull]], [[gadwall]], and [[common tern]]. The strait constitutes an important locale, especially ice-free winters, besides the lake [[Isbladskärret]] on [[Djurgården]].&lt;ref name="vattenvard-htaml" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-pdf" /&gt;

Vegetation on the shore lines of Lilla Värtan includes [[alder]], [[purple loosestrife]], [[common valerian]], [[yellow loosestrife]], [[reed canary-grass]], [[tall fescue]], [[lesser periwinkle]], and [[giant knotweed]].&lt;ref name="SFV-strandvegetation"&gt;{{cite web

The Kingdom of [[Dahomey]] was an overseas possession of [[France]]—part of [[French West Africa]]—until 1958. In that year Dahomey became an autonomous republic, and gained full independence in 1960. The United States immediately recognized Dahomey and began the process of initiating diplomatic relations. A U.S. Embassy at [[Abidjan]], [[Cote d'Ivoire]] (then named Ivory Coast) was established with Donald L. Norland as [[Chargé d'Affaires]] ''[[ad interim]]''. The embassy was also accredited also to Dahomey, [[Niger]], and [[Republic of Upper Volta|Upper Volta]] (now named [[Burkina Faso]]) while resident at Abidjan. On July 31, 1960, Chargé Norland presented his credentials to the government of Dahomey, to take effect on August 1, 1960. On October 14, 1960, [[R. Borden Reams]] was appointed as the [[ambassador]] and presented his credentials on November 26, 1960.

On February 15, 1961, the Embassy in [[Cotonou]], Dahomey, was established with Converse Hettinger as Chargé d'Affaires ''ad interim''. Ambassador Reams remained resident in Abidjan.

In 1961 [[Robinson McIlvaine]] was appointed as [[Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary]] with a separate commission solely to Dahomey. He presented his credentials to the government of Dahomey on June 22, 1961.

The Republic of Dahomey changed its name to [[Benin|Republic of Benin]] in 1975.

In June 2009, President Barack Obama nominated [[James Knight (Ambassador)|James Knight]] to succeed Brown as U.S. Ambassador to Benin.

'''Molyneux''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɒ|l|ᵻ|nj|uː}}; [[Old Norman]]: ''De Molines'' or ''De Moulins'') is a [[French name|French]] [[surname]]. The surname has been linked primarily to a large [[Normans|Norman]] family that settled in [[Lancashire]], United Kingdom from [[Normandy]] following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]]. By the 14th century the Molyneux family had become so large that it split into three main branches; the [[Lancashire]] line, who became the [[Earl of Sefton|Earls of Sefton]], the [[Nottingham]] line, and the [[Calais]] line, from family still left over in Normandy. There was also a branch of the family who were [[Molyneux baronets|Irish baronets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Home |url=http://www.mx-world.org/default.aspx |title=International Molyneux Family Association |publisher=Mx-world.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and history==
[[Image:GareDeMoulineauxLandryLachèvre.jpg|thumb|left|Moulineaux in the Normandy region of France, ancestral home of the Molyneux family.]]
The ancestors of the Molyneaux family who arrived in [[England]] with the Normans bore the name "de Molines" or "de Moulins", [[Old Norman]] in origin, meaning "Mill", and eventually changed into "Molyneux". The early historical background of the family is sparse, coming from scattered genealogical, historical, and archaeological sources, composed of a mixture of [[legend]], romanticized literary invention, and fact.  Some historians derive the ''de Moulins'' came from [[Moulineaux|Molineaux-sur-Seine]], near [[Rouen]], in [[Normandy]] where they were guardians of [[Château de Robert-le-Diable]].&lt;ref&gt;Pilgrim Alden: the story of the life of the first John Alden in America with the interwoven story of the life and doings of the Pilgrim colony and some account of later Aldens pp119-128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Norman people and their existing descendants in the British dominions and the United States of America''. Henry S. King &amp; Co., 1874&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest claimed common ancestor of the family is said to be Robert de Moulins of Château de Moulineaux in Molineaux-Sur-Seine, called a follower of William of Normandy, though no surviving source attests to his existence. 
[[Image:St Helen's Church, Sefton.jpg|thumb|left|[[St Helen's Church, Sefton|St. Helen's Church]] was built as the Molyneux family chapel in [[Sefton, Merseyside|Sefton]] [[Merseyside]] in 1170.]]  Other sources claim the family originally came from [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins, France]]. Wherever their origin, Robert de Moulins' son, William, settled in [[Lancashire]]. He had two sons William and Vivian de Moulins. [[Roger the Poitevin]] who possessed large tracts of land in Lancashire in what was then called ''inter Mersam et Ripam'', that is, "between the [[Mersey]] and the [[River Ribble|Ribble]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=John (ed.)|title=Domesday Book:Cheshire|year=1978|publisher=Phillimore &amp; Co.|pages=R1:1–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; by gift of the crown gave Molyneux large land holdings and the manors of Septon ([[Sefton, Merseyside|Sefton]]), [[Thornton, Lancashire|Thornton]], [[Cuerden]], ten [[carucate]]s and a half of land, at the service of half a knight's fee. William Molyneux made Septon his chief seat and was succeeded by Vivian de Molyneux.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Kimber]] and Richard Johnson, ''The Baronetage of England: Containing A Genealogical and Historical Account of all the English Baronetts Now Existing'', Vol. I, Published 1771, Printed for G. Woodfall, and others pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Kimber]], ''The Peerage of Ireland'', Vol. II, Published by Printed for J. Almon, London, 1768, pp. 26–31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Molyneux, Nellie Zada Rice (1904) [https://archive.org/details/historygenealogic00moly ''History, Genealogical and Biographical, of the Molyneux Families'']. Syracuse, N.Y., C. W. Bardeen. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

They also held the Manor of [[Little Crosby]], later [[Ince Blundell Hall]], which had been held by one Uctred until 1066. By 1212 it was owned by Richard de Molyneux of Sefton before being turned over to the Blundell family. The Molyneuxs later owned most of the districts of [[Speke]] and [[Rainhill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Moss, John |url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/history/old-families5.html |title=Old Historic Families of Manchester, Cheshire and Lancashire 7 |publisher=Manchester2002-uk.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royalist [[gentry]] family held a large moated manor, a corn mill on the [[River Alt]], and the advowson of [[St Helen's Church, Sefton|St. Helen's Church]] at [[Sefton, Merseyside|Sefton]] without interruption from about 1100 to 1700.  Their successors, by then Earls, moved to [[Croxteth Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/collections/historic-characterisation-project/Sefton-Part-6.pdf Sefton Historic Settlement Study]. Merseyside Historic Characterisation Project, Museum of Liverpool (December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Sefton Molyneux family, crusaders Richard (d. 1290) and William Molyneux (d. 1320) are entombed within the church, and are the its oldest inhabitants. Their effigies now lie beneath an arch moulding set into the wall in the Molyneux chapel, which is outside of the 14th-century church walls. The [[Lancashire]] line of the family became [[Earl of Sefton|Earls of Sefton]], while there were also a branches seated at [[Nottingham]] and [[Calais]].
[[File:CroxtethHall2010.JPG|thumb|left|Croxteth Hall, Home of the Earls of Sefton branch of the Molyneux family.]]
The senior branch of the Sefton family had been staunch Catholics and Royalists (notably in the  17th and 18th centuries) through the worst times until Charles Molyneux, 8th Viscount Molyneux, was rewarded for converting to the Protestant faith. The relatively youthful second and third Viscounts fought on the Royalist side both politically and militarily. Although Liverpool Castle had been partly dismantled in 1660–1678, Caryll Molyneux, the 3rd Viscount, had used it for storing arms. During the reign of King [[James II of England|James II]], he was outlawed by Parliament for supporting the deposed king in 1688 to 1689. Control of the Castle finally passed out of Molyneux hands after Caryll had again been suspected of participation in a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] plot. William, the 7th Viscount, was a Jesuit, and there were in his time not less than seven Molyneux in the [[Society of Jesus]] alone.

Variations of the surname include "Mullinax", "Mullenax", "Molinex", "Mullinix", "Mullenneix", "Mullennix", "Mullineaux", "Molinieux", "Molinaux", "Molineaux", "Mollineaux", "Molineux", and several others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~imfa/home.html International Molyneux Family Association].&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''natural monument''' is a natural or natural/cultural feature of outstanding or unique value because of its inherent rarity, representative of aesthetic qualities or cultural significance. 

Under [[World Commission on Protected Areas]] guidelines, natural monuments are level III, described as:
:"Areas are set aside to protect a specific natural monument, which can be a landform, sea mount, submarine cavern, geological feature such as a cave or even a living feature such as an ancient grove. They are generally quite small protected areas and often have high visitor value."
This is a lower level of protection than level II (national parks) and level I (wilderness areas).

The European Environment Agency's guidelines for selection of a natural monument are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glossary.eea.europa.eu/EEAGlossary/N/natural_monument|title=Environmental Terminology Discovery Service — EEA|publisher=glossary.eea.europa.eu|access-date=2006-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718151533/http://glossary.eea.europa.eu/EEAGlossary/N/natural_monument|archive-date=2006-07-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The area should contain one or more features of outstanding significance. Appropriate natural features include waterfalls, caves, [[impact crater|crater]]s, fossil beds, sand dunes and marine features, along with unique or representative [[fauna]] and [[flora]]; associated cultural features might include cave dwellings, cliff-top forts, archaeological sites, or natural sites which have heritage significance to indigenous peoples.
* The area should be large enough to protect the integrity of the feature and its immediately related surroundings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12036">'''Old European''' ({{lang-de|Alteuropäisch}}) is the term used by [[Hans Krahe]] (1964) for the language of the oldest reconstructed stratum of European '''[[hydronymy]]''' (river names) in Central and Western Europe.&lt;ref name=Krahe&gt;Hans Krahe, ''Unsere ältesten Flussnamen'', Wiesbaden Edition Otto Harrassowiitz (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"Old European" in this sense is not to be confused with the term as used by [[Marija Gimbutas]] who applies it to non-Indo-European or pre-Indo-European [[Neolithic Europe]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old European hydronymic map for the root *al-, *alm- Krahe.jpg|500px|thumb|Old European hydronymic map for the root ''*al-'', ''*alm-'']]

==Geography==
Krahe writes in A1, chapter III, "Introducing preface" Number 2&lt;ref name=Krahe/&gt;{{rp|32}} that the old European hydronomy extended from Scandinavia to South Italy, from Western Europe including the British Isles to the Baltic countries. Of the three Mediterranean peninsulas, Italy was most completely included, whilst the Balkan Peninsula was only scarcely covered. He writes that what he presents for hydronomy also applies to mountains and ranges of mountains, and continues with "Karpaten" and "Karawanken", certainly within the Slavic settlement area, omitting the Bavarian/Austrian "Karwendel" though.&lt;ref name=Krahe/&gt;{{rp|12}} This area is associated with the spread of the later "Western" Indo-European dialects, the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], and [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] branches.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Notably exempt is [[Greece]].

[[File:Old European hydronymic map for the root *Sal-, *Salm-.jpg|500px|thumb|Old European hydronymic map for the root ''*Sal-'', ''*Salm-'']]

Krahe located the geographical nucleus of this area as stretching from the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] across [[Western Poland]] and [[Germany]] to the [[Swiss plateau]] and the upper [[Danube]] north of the [[Alps]], while he considered the Old European river names of southern France, Italy and Spain to be later imports, replacing "[[Aegean languages|Aegean]]-[[Pelasgian]]" and [[Iberian language|Iberian]] substrates,&lt;ref name=Krahe /&gt;{{rp|81}} corresponding to [[Italic peoples|Italic]], [[Celtiberians|Celtic]] and [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] "invasions" from about 1300 BC.

==Origins of names==
Krahe continues in III A 5, "Geographic Area and age of the paleoeuropean hydronomy" that the overwhelming majority of river and stream names originate from words which in the historical single languages cannot be found or cannot be found any more.&lt;ref name=Krahe /&gt;{{rp|77}} He uses mainly Indo-European roots to allow the river names in question to speak (rule 1) of which more than 10,000 are listed.

In III A 2, "Etymology and Semasiology of the paleoeuropean river names" Krahe states that the oldest strata are composed by prerequisites of nature and that the river names especially refer to the water itself (rule 2),&lt;ref name=Krahe /&gt;{{rp|60}} and that words referring to humans and culture are newer. Both rules are important arguments for considering the old European hydronomy of southern France and the north of the Iberian Peninsula as a result of secondary implementation (A.1. number 3) due to a postulated immigration around 1300 BC.

In "Morphology of Paleoeuropean river names" III A1 number 3, Krahe concentrates on suffixes (simples and multiples) and distinguishes eleven different ones in a table.&lt;ref name=Krahe /&gt;{{rp|62–63}} He attributes geographical (Central European vs. South European or Eastern), functional (for example affluent) or temporal (before or after a change of consonants or vowels) functions to the suffixes of the river names (Rule 3). For the temporal function he claims the existence of a system of phonetic changes (''Lautverschiebung''), however he does not include prefixes in his considerations.

Krahe's concentration on Indo-European roots and the omission of prefixes had serious negative consequences, because ever later focus was placed on those more than 10,000 roots, perhaps on [[old Irish]], but scarcely on [[Gaulish]] and actual Celtic languages or [[Baltic languages]] and completely leaving out [[Basque language|Basque]]. Delamarre later included for example under Gaulish ''dubron'' only rivers with "B" (or similar) leaving out other names, which Krahe would have called ''Schwundstufe'' = loss of a letter or with inversion of letters or both.

Krahe ignored the impact of Moorish occupation in Spain, which led to frequent combinations of Arab "prefixes" (always at the beginning) on Celtic "suffixes" as seen in [[Guadiana]] (Guadi = river and Anas = bayous, muddy, as it appears in [[Ptolemy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ptolemaios Handbuch der Geographie|editors= Alfred Stückelberg und Gerd Grasshoff|publisher= Schwabe|location= Basel| ISBN=978-3-7965-2148-5 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tables &lt;comparison old European hydronyms&gt; show that, in contradiction to Krahe's opinion, hydronyms (and toponyms) can in some cases very well be explained even by modern Irish, Welsh, or French and certainly by Gaulish.

==Krahe's influence on other scientists==
Krahe has influenced archaeologists, linguists and particularly experts in Celtic languages:

[[Marija Gimbutas]] (Lithuanian: Marija Gimbutiene) studied in [[Tübingen]], and received her doctorate of archeology in 1946 in the same department where Krahe lectured. Gimbutas developed the [[Kurgan]] theory.

[[Jürgen Untermann]], a disciple of Krahe with dissertation 1954 in Tübingen was professor for [[Comparative Linguistics]] at the [[University of Cologne]]. He was an [[epigraphy|epigraphist]] and Indoeuropeanist.

[[Antonio Tovar]], with preliminary studies in Berlin, later professor of the University of Salamanca, was professor for Comparative Linguistics in Tübingen from 1967 to 1979. Together with Manuel Agud and [[Koldo Mitxelena]] he prepared an unedited etymological dictionary of the [[Basque language]]. Mitxelena (in English editions he appears as Luis Michelena) was only the creator of the modern Basque language.

==Other authors==
Other authors with a focus on or touching on the topic old European hydronomy are:

Xavier Delamarre is a French linguist whose standard work is ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'' (2nd revised and augmented edition Paris, 2003), with the subtitle "Une approche linguistique du vieux-celtique continental". This is in fact the most comprehensive publication on [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] words. Slightly more than 800 terms appear in alphabetical order derived from Gaulish-Greek, Gaulish-Etruscan and Gaulish-Latin or solely Gaulish inscriptions, printed classical languages, coins and some terms of Celtic substrate in [[Occitan]]. He presents all cases of appearance of toponyms and hydronyms in question, cites authors and roots, showing alternatives, and classifies, if necessary, as uncertain or questionable. He shows all river name examples with prefixes. For example, see "comparison of old hydronyms" adding "water", "clear", "hard stone", etc.

The German linguist [[Theo Vennemann]] suggested in 2003 that the language of the old European hydronyms was [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] and [[Pre-Indo-European languages|Pre-Indo-European]].&lt;ref&gt;Theo Vennemann, Patrizia Noel Aziz Hanna, ''Europa Vasconica, Europa Semitica'', published by Walter de Gruyter, 2003, {{ISBN|3-11-017054-X}}, 9783110170542.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has been criticised as being seriously flawed, and the more generally accepted view is that hydronyms are of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kitson|first=P.R.|title=British and European River Names|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|date=November 1996|volume=94|issue=2|pages=73–118|doi=10.1111/j.1467-968X.1996.tb01178.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish philologist Francisco Villar Liébana argued in 1990 for the Old European preserved in river names and confined to the hydronymic substratum in the Iberian Peninsula as yet another Indo-European layer with no immediate relationship to the [[Lusitanian language]].&lt;ref name=wodtkovillar&gt;{{cite book|last=Wodtko|first=Dagmar S|title=Celtic from the West Chapter 11: The Problem of Lusitanian|year=2010|publisher=Oxbow Books, Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-84217-410-4|pages=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the idea of "Old European" was criticized by Untermann in 1999 and De Hoz in 2001.&lt;ref name=wodtkovillar/&gt; 
Villar Liébana is a supporter of Gimbutas against the theories of [[Colin Renfrew]]. In his work, ''Indoeuropeos y No Indoeuropeos en la Hispania Prerromana'' (''"Indo-Europeans and Non-Indo-Europeans in Pre-Roman Hispania"'') he presents a nine root "series" and a few more collective "series", mainly of toponyms (Hispanic and non-Hispanic) but also including hydronyms.&lt;ref name=lieb&gt;{{cite book|author=Francisco Villar Liébana|title=Indoeuropeos y No Indoeuropeos en la Hispania Perromana|year =2000|ISBN= 84-7800-968-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
For example, in chapter IV B VII&lt;ref name=lieb/&gt;{{rp|120}} Liebana discusses hydronyms of the series "uba" starting &lt;ref name=lieb/&gt;{{rp|149}} with Maenuba (Pliny 3.8) = modern [[Veléz]] and with the same name affluent of the [[Baetis]] (Pliny 3.11) = [[Guadiamar]], [[Salduba]] (close to [[Málaga]]). He compares modern rivers like Ubia, Ove, Fonte dos Ovos  with, amongst others, the [[Danube]],&lt;ref name=lieb/&gt;{{rp|149}} and with historical Corduba (actual [[Córdoba, Andalusia]]).&lt;ref name=lieb/&gt;{{rp|153}} Wherever "uba" appears, like in the rivers Saruba = actual [[Saar (river)]], an affluent of [[Moselle (river)|Mosel]], Spanish fuente Sarobals (Huesca), Sarrubian (Huesca), he acknowledges only "uba" and not the root "Dan" in Danubius (corresponding to [[Dnieper]] and [[Dniester]]) or the root "Sar" in others, which all are Indo-European roots.

==Examples==
The map on the right shows Old European hydronymic maps for the root  *var-, *ver- (figure 3, entitled Karte 5).{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} (maps for *al-, *alm-(figure 1, entitled Karte 2) and *Sal-, *Salm- (figure 2, entitled Karte 4) are not shown)

The '''Orekhovsky''' (Ореховский) is a [[waterfall]] in the [[Sochi National Park]]. It takes its name from [[Orekhovka]], a settlement in the [[Khosta District]] of [[Sochi]]. It is located on the Bezumenka stream at its confluence with the [[Sochi River]]. Orekhovsky is the second highest waterfall in the city, with a height of 27.5&amp;nbsp;meters.&lt;ref name="kuban"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuban.aif.ru/culture/details/488075|title=Выпущена новая серия олимпийских марок "Сочи 2014" &amp;#124; КУЛЬТУРА: События &amp;#124; КУЛЬТУРА &amp;#124; АиФ Краснодар|publisher=kuban.aif.ru|accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, it was known as ''Melnichny'' ("the miller's fall").&lt;ref name="SochiExc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sochi.com/exc/?region=74&amp;id=27|title=Экскурсии Сочи / Водопад Ореховский, ореховские водопады в сочи|publisher=sochi.com|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby is a grove of [[walnut]]s and [[rhododendron]].

{{Occupational hazards}}

'''Personal protective equipment''' ('''PPE''') refers to protective [[clothing]], [[helmets]], [[goggles]], or other garments or equipment designed to protect the wearer's body from [[injury]] or [[infection]]. The hazards addressed by protective equipment include physical, electrical, heat, chemicals, [[biological hazard|biohazards]], and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate matter]]. Protective equipment may be worn for job-related [[occupational safety and health]] purposes, as well as for [[sports]] and other  [[recreation|recreational activities]]. "Protective clothing" is applied to traditional categories of clothing, and "protective gear" applies to items such as pads, guards, shields, or  masks, and others.

The purpose of personal protective equipment is to reduce employee exposure to hazards when [[engineering controls]] and [[administrative controls]] are not feasible or effective to reduce these risks to acceptable levels. PPE is needed when there are hazards present. PPE has the serious limitation that it does not eliminate the hazard at the source and may result in employees being exposed to the hazard if the equipment fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citation.co.uk/health-and-safety/personal-protective-equipment |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014041258/http://www.citation.co.uk/health-and-safety/personal-protective-equipment |archivedate=2012-10-14 |df= }} Personal Protective Equipment&lt;/ref&gt;

Any item of PPE imposes a barrier between the wearer/user and the working environment. This can create additional strains on the wearer;
impair their ability to carry out their work and create significant levels of discomfort. Any of these can discourage wearers from using PPE correctly, therefore placing them at risk of injury, ill-health or, under extreme circumstances, death. Good ergonomic design can help to minimise these barriers and can therefore help to ensure safe and healthy working conditions through the correct use of PPE.

Practices of occupational safety and health can use hazard controls and interventions to mitigate workplace hazards, which pose a threat to the safety and quality of life of workers. The [[hierarchy of hazard controls]] provides a policy framework which ranks the types of hazard controls in terms of absolute risk reduction. At the top of the hierarchy are [[Hazard elimination|elimination]] and [[Hazard substitution|substitution]], which remove the hazard entirely or replace the hazard with a safer alternative. If elimination or substitution measures cannot apply, engineering controls and administrative controls, which seek to design safer mechanisms and coach safer human behavior, are implemented. Personal protective equipment ranks last on the hierarchy of controls, as the workers are regularly exposed to the hazard, with a barrier of protection. The hierarchy of controls is important in acknowledging that, while personal protective equipment has tremendous utility, it is not the desired mechanism of control in terms of worker safety.

==Types==
[[File:Die Bienenzüchter (Bruegel).jpg|thumb|left|A 1568 painting depicting beekeepers in protective clothing, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]].]]

Personal protective equipment can be categorized by the area of the body protected, by the types of hazard, and by the type of garment or accessory. A single item, for example boots, may provide multiple forms of protection: a steel toe cap and steel insoles for protection of the feet from crushing or puncture injuries, impervious rubber and lining for protection from water and chemicals, high [[Reflectance|reflectivity]] and heat resistance for protection from radiant heat, and high electrical [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|resistivity]] for protection from electric shock. The protective attributes of each piece of equipment must be compared with the hazards expected to be found in the workplace. More breathable types of personal protective equipment may not lead to more contamination but do result in greater user satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verbeek|first1=Jos H|last2=Ijaz|first2=Sharea|last3=Mischke|first3=Christina|last4=Ruotsalainen|first4=Jani H|last5=Mäkelä|first5=Erja|last6=Neuvonen|first6=Kaisa|last7=Edmond|first7=Michael B|last8=Sauni|first8=Riitta|last9=Kilinc Balci|first9=F Selcen|last10=Mihalache|first10=Raluca C|title=Personal protective equipment for preventing highly infectious diseases due to exposure to contaminated body fluids in healthcare staff|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=19 April 2016|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd011621.pub2|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011621.pub2/full|accessdate=29 April 2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|language=en|pmid=27093058|volume=4|page=CD011621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respirators===
{{main article|Respirator}}
[[File:Air-Purifying Respirator.jpg|thumb|Air-purifying respirator]]

Respirators serve to protect the user from breathing in contaminants in the air, thus preserving the health of one's respiratory tract. There are two main types of respirators. One type of respirator functions by filtering out chemicals and gases, or airborne particles, from the air breathed by the user.&lt;ref name=resp&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/respirators/ Respirators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830084012/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/respirators/ |date=2012-08-30 }}. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; The filtration may be either passive or [[Powered, air-purifying respirator|active (powered)]]. [[Gas mask]]s and [[respirator|particulate respirators]] are examples of this type of respirator. A second type of respirator protects users by providing clean, respirable air from another source. This type includes airline respirators and [[self-contained breathing apparatus]] (SCBA).&lt;ref name =resp/&gt; In work environments, respirators are relied upon when adequate ventilation is not available or other engineering control systems are not feasible or inadequate.&lt;ref name=resp/&gt;

In the United Kingdom, an organization that has extensive expertise in respiratory protective equipment is the [[Institute of Occupational Medicine]]. This expertise has been built on a long-standing and varied research programme that has included the setting of workplace protection factors to the assessment of efficacy of masks available through high street retail outlets.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE), [[NHS Health Scotland]] and Healthy Working Lives (HWL) have jointly developed the RPE (Respiratory Protective Equipment) Selector Tool, which is web-based. This interactive tool provides descriptions of different types of respirators and breathing apparatuses, as well as "dos and don'ts" for each type.&lt;ref name=rpe&gt;[http://www.healthyworkinglives.com/rpe-selector/ "Selecting the right Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE) for the job"]. Healthy Working Lives. 2008-4-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) provides recommendations on respirator use, in accordance to NIOSH federal respiratory regulations 42 CFR Part 84.&lt;ref name=resp/&gt; [[The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory]] (NPPTL) of NIOSH is tasked towards actively conducting studies on respirators and providing recommendations.&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/factsheets/respfact.html CDC - NIOSH - Respirator Fact Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928092148/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/factsheets/respfact.html |date=2017-09-28 }}. The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skin protection===
[[File:Worker weighing carbon nanotubes.png|alt=A man wearing a white lab coat reaches over a beaker containing white powder on a balance|thumb|A worker wearing a [[respirator]], [[lab coat]], and [[Medical glove|gloves]] while weighing [[carbon nanotube]]s]]
[[File:Incorrect use of personal protective equipment.png|alt=A closeup of a person's arm requing into a bucket filled with a black material|thumb|This is an incorrect use of personal protective equipment, because the gap between the [[Medical glove|glove]] and the [[lab coat]] exposes the wrist to hazardous materials.]]
Occupational skin diseases such as [[contact dermatitis]], [[skin cancer]]s, and other skin injuries and infections are the second-most common type of occupational disease and can be very costly.&lt;ref name="skin"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/skin/ CDC - Skin Exposures and Effects - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806040459/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/skin/ |date=2012-08-06 }}. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Skin hazards, which lead to occupational skin disease, can be classified into four groups. [[Chemical hazard|Chemical agents]] can come into contact with the skin through direct contact with contaminated surfaces, deposition of aerosols, immersion or splashes.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Physical agents such as extreme temperatures and ultraviolet or solar radiation can be damaging to the skin over prolonged exposure.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Mechanical trauma occurs in the form of friction, pressure, abrasions, lacerations and contusions.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Biological agents such as parasites, microorganisms, plants and animals can have varied effects when exposed to the skin.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt;

Any form of PPE that acts as a barrier between the skin and the agent of exposure can be considered skin protection. Because much work is done with the hands, [[glove]]s are an essential item in providing skin protection. Some examples of gloves commonly used as PPE include [[rubber gloves]], [[cut-resistant gloves]], [[chainsaw safety clothing|chainsaw gloves]] and heat-resistant gloves. For sports and other recreational activities, many different gloves are used for protection, generally against mechanical trauma.

Other than gloves, any other article of clothing or protection worn for a purpose serve to protect the skin. [[White coat|Lab coats]] for example, are worn to protect against potential splashes of chemicals. [[Face shield]]s serve to protect one's face from potential impact hazards, chemical splashes or possible infectious fluid.

===Eye protection===
{{Main|Eye protection}}
[[Image:Nuxos1pl.JPG|thumb|left|A paintball player wearing appropriate eye protection against impact.]]

Each day, about 2000 US workers have a job-related eye injury that requires medical attention.&lt;ref name="eye"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/ CDC - Eye Safety - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707114404/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/ |date=2017-07-07 }}. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Eye injuries can happen through a variety of means. Most eye injuries occur when solid particles such as metal slivers, wood chips, sand or cement chips get into the eye.&lt;ref name="eye" /&gt; Smaller particles in [[smoke]]s and larger particles such as broken glass also account for particulate matter-causing eye injuries. Blunt force trauma can occur to the eye when excessive force comes into contact with the eye. Chemical burns, biological agents, and thermal agents, from sources such as [[welding]] torches and [[ultraviolet|UV light]], also contribute to occupational eye injury.&lt;ref name="eyesafe"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/eyesafe.html CDC - Eye Safety - Eye Safety for Emergency Response and Disaster Recovery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902212409/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/eyesafe.html |date=2017-09-02 }}. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the required eye protection varies by occupation, the safety provided can be generalized. Safety glasses provide protection from external debris, and should provide side protection via a wrap-around design or side shields.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* [[Goggles]] provide better protection than safety glasses, and are effective in preventing eye injury from chemical splashes, impact, dusty environments and welding.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt; Goggles with high air flow should be used to prevent fogging.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* [[Face shield]]s provide additional protection and are worn over the standard eyewear; they also provide protection from impact, chemical, and blood-borne hazards.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* Full-facepiece respirators are considered the best form of eye protection when respiratory protection is needed as well, but may be less effective against potential impact hazards to the eye.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* Eye protection for welding is shaded to different degrees, depending on the specific operation.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;

===Hearing protection===
{{Main article|Hearing protection}}
[[Industrial noise]] is often overlooked as an occupational hazard, as it is not visible to the eye. Overall, about 22 million workers in the United States are exposed to potentially damaging noise levels each year.&lt;ref name="noise"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/stats.html CDC - Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention - Facts and Statistics - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703145248/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/stats.html |date=2016-07-03 }}. The National Institute for Occuaptional Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational hearing loss accounted for 14% of all occupational illnesses in 2007, with about 23,000 cases significant enough to cause permanent hearing impairment.&lt;ref name="noise" /&gt; About 82% of occupational hearing loss cases occurred to workers in the manufacturing sector.&lt;ref name="noise" /&gt; The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] establishes occupational noise exposure standards.&lt;ref name="oshanoise"&gt;[https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9735 Occupational noise exposure - 1910.95] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402213424/https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9735 |date=2015-04-02 }}. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; NIOSH recommends that worker exposures to noise be reduced to a level equivalent to 85&amp;nbsp;dBA for eight hours to reduce occupational [[noise-induced hearing loss]].&lt;ref name="criteria"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf Criteria for a Recommended Standard: Occupational Noise Exposure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202172749/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf |date=2017-02-02 }}.  DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 98-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

PPE for hearing protection consists of [[earplugs]] and [[earmuffs]]. Workers who are regularly exposed to noise levels above the NIOSH recommendation should be furnished hearing protection by the employers, as they are a low-cost intervention.

===Protective clothing and ensembles===
{{See also|List of personal protective equipment by body area}}
[[File:Regal mit Persönlicher Schutzausrüstung.jpg|thumb|upright|Locker containing personal protective equipment]][[Image:High-Pressure-Cleaning-with-Personal-Protective-Equipment.jpg|thumb|right|A complete PPE ensemble worn during high pressure cleaning work]]

This form of PPE is all-encompassing and refers to the various suits and uniforms worn to protect the user from harm. Lab coats worn by scientists and [[ballistic vest]]s worn by law enforcement officials, which are worn on a regular basis, would fall into this category. Entire sets of PPE, worn together in a combined suit, are also in this category.

====Ensembles====
Below are some examples of ensembles of personal protective equipment, worn together for a specific occupation or task, to provide maximum protection for the user.
* [[Chainsaw]] [[chainsaw safety clothing|protection]] (especially a helmet with face guard, hearing protection, [[kevlar]] [[chaps]], anti-vibration gloves, and [[Chainsaw safety clothing#Boots|chainsaw safety boots]]).
* [[Beekeeping|Bee-keepers]] wear various levels of protection depending on the temperament of their bees and the reaction of the bees to nectar availability. At minimum most bee keepers wear a brimmed hat and a veil made of fine mesh netting. The next level of protection involves [[leather glove]]s with long gauntlets and some way of keeping [[bees]] from crawling up one's trouser legs. In extreme cases, specially fabricated shirts and trousers can serve as barriers to the bees' stingers.
* [[Diving equipment]], for underwater diving, constitutes equipment such as a [[diving helmet]] or [[diving mask]], an [[scuba set|underwater breathing apparatus]], and a [[diving suit]].
* [[Firefighter]]s wear PPE designed to provide protection against fires and various fumes and gases. PPE worn by firefighters include [[bunker gear]], [[self-contained breathing apparatus]], a [[helmet]], [[steel-toe boot|safety boots]], and a [[PASS device]].

====In sports====
{{Main|Protective gear in sports}}
Participants in sports often wear protective equipment. Studies performed on the injuries of professional athletes, such as that on [[National Football League|NFL]] players,&lt;ref name=brainnfl&gt;[http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/09/nfl-brain-injury/ CDC - NIOSH Science Blog - Brain Injury in the NFL] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20121220112221/http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/09/nfl-brain-injury/ |date=2012-12-20 }}.

==Limits of the definition==
[[File:Safetyequipment3030.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Workers using personal protective equipment while painting poles. While basic head protection is present, no engineering fall protection systems appear to be in place.]]
The definition of what constitutes as personal protective equipment varies by country. In the United States, the laws regarding PPE also vary by state. In 2011, workplace safety complaints were brought against [[Hustler]] and other adult film production companies by the [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]], leading to several citations brought by [[California Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Cal/OSHA]].&lt;ref name=hustler&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110330007006/en/Larry-Flynt%E2%80%99s-Hustler-Video-Cited-CalOSHA-Condoms|title=Larry Flynt’s Hustler Video Cited by Cal/OSHA over Condoms, Safety, Says AHF|author=|date=|website=businesswire.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806224124/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110330007006/en/Larry-Flynt%E2%80%99s-Hustler-Video-Cited-CalOSHA-Condoms|archivedate=6 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure to use [[condom]]s by adult film stars was a violation of Cal/OSHA's Blood borne Pathogens Program, Personal Protective Equipment.&lt;ref name=hustler/&gt; This example shows that personal protective equipment can cover a variety of occupations in the United States, and has a wide-ranging definition.

==Legislation in the European Union==
At the [[European Union]] level, personal protective equipment is governed by Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment (PPE). The Directive is designed to ensure that PPE meets common quality and safety standards by setting out basic safety requirements for personal protective equipment, as well as conditions for its placement on the market and free movement within the EU single market. It covers ‘any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/1989/686/oj/eng|title=Council Directive 89/686/EEC of 21 December 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to personal protective equipment|author=|date=30 December 1989|website=europa.eu|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directive was adopted on 21 January 1989 and came into force on 1 July 1992. The [[European Commission]] additionally allowed for a transition period until 30 June 1995 to give companies sufficient time to adapt to the legislation. After this date, all PPE placed on the market in EU Member States was required to comply with the requirements of Directive 89/686/EEC and carry the [[CE Marking]].

Article 1 of Directive 89/686/EEC defines personal protective equipment as any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards. PPE which falls under the scope of the Directive is divided into three categories:
* Category I: simple design (e.g. gardening gloves, footwear, ski goggles)
* Category II:  PPE not falling into category I or III (e.g. personal flotation devices, dry and wet suits)
* Category III:  complex design (e.g. respiratory equipment, harnesses)

Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment does not distinguish between PPE for professional use and PPE for leisure purposes.

Personal protective equipment falling within the scope of the Directive must comply with the basic health and safety requirements set out in Annex II of the Directive. To facilitate conformity with these requirements, harmonized standards are developed at the European or international level by the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN, CENELEC) and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] in relation to the design and manufacture of the product. Usage of the harmonized standards is voluntary and provides presumption of conformity. However, manufacturers may choose an alternative method of complying with the requirements of the Directive.

Personal protective equipment excluded from the scope of the Directive includes:
* PPE designed for and used by the armed forces or in the maintenance of law and order;
* PPE for self-defence (e.g. aerosol canisters, personal deterrent weapons);
* PPE designed and manufactured for personal use against adverse atmospheric conditions (e.g. seasonal clothing, umbrellas), damp and water (e.g. dish-washing gloves) and heat;
* PPE  used on vessels and aircraft but not worn at all times;
* helmets and visors intended for users of two- or three-wheeled motor vehicles.

The European Commission is currently working to revise Directive 89/686/EEC. The revision will look at the scope of the Directive, the conformity assessment procedures and technical requirements regarding market surveillance. It will also align the Directive with the New Legalislative Framework. The European Commission is likely to publish its proposal in 2013. It will then be discussed by the [[European Parliament]] and [[Council of the European Union]] under the ordinary legislative procedure before being published in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]] and becoming law.

In [[geology]] a '''sag''', or [[Trough (geology)|trough]], is a depressed, persistent, low area; the opposite of an arch, or [[ridge]], a raised, persistent, high area. The terms sag and arch were used historically to describe very large features, for example, characterizing North America as two arches with a sag between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature|date=August 18, 1892|volume=46|issue=1190|doi=10.1038/046372a0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9EKAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=September 17, 2011|author=Charles Lapworth|page=377|format=Opening address by head of the Geology Section|quote=...the geographical surface of North America, considered as a whole, is in reality that of a double arch, with a sag or common trough in the middle.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also, a sag is a former river bed which has been partially filled with debris from [[glacier|glaciation]] or other natural processes but which is still visible in the surface terrain. Sags formed by the former river beds of large rivers often become the valleys of smaller streams after a change of course by the main river.

Examples of sags include the former continuations of the [[Grand River (South Dakota)|Grand]], [[Moreau River (South Dakota)|Moreau]] and [[White River (Missouri River)|White]] rivers in [[South Dakota]] in the United States. Before the last [[ice age]] these rivers continued eastward past their current confluences with the present course of [[Missouri River]]. The sags are prominently visible on the [[plateau]] of the [[Coteau du Missouri]], allowing small streams to drain into the Missouri from its eastern side.

'''Sidhra''' is a town and municipality in the city of [[Jammu]] in the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].

== Etymology ==
According to local tradition, the name Sidhra is derived from two [[Urdu]] words; "Seedhi" means straight, and "Raah" means way. This is a reference to the main road and way in Sidhra being straight since its establishment.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Geography ==
Sidhra is located on the foothills of the [[Shivalik Hills]] and is situated on the banks of the [[Tawi River]]. [[Srinagar Jammu National Highway]] or NH-44 goes through this town. The Tawi Bridge connects it with Old City, while the highway from the opposite direction connects it with the new city.

== Demographics ==
Sidhra town is home to many Kashmiri and Pahari Muslim migrants mostly from [[Kashmir Valley]], [[Chenab Valley]] and [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]] and [[Rajouri District|Rajouri]] districts.Many Muslims from [[Kashmir Valley]] have settled here because of unrest in [[Kashmir Valley|Valley]].People from [[Chenab Valley]] and other hills of [[Jammu Division]] have settled here for better facilities and education.
Some Kashmiri Muslims have made this area their second home or winter home.They settle here for six months during winters and go back during summers.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2012}}
The [[Power (international relations)|international system]] is for the most part made up by '''small powers''' or '''small states'''. While a small power in the international system may never equal or surpass the effect of larger powers, they can nevertheless influence the workings of the international system together with others. The formalization of the division between small and great powers came about with the signing of the [[Treaty of Chaumont]] in 1814. Before that the assumption had been that all independent states were in theory equal regardless of actual strength and responsibilities. From the second half of the twentieth century, the bipolar power blocs decreased the strategic room for manoeuvre for smaller actors.

According to a 2017 review study, "What scholars can agree on is that small states generally prefer multilateralism as both a path to influence and a means to restrain larger states. Studies of influential small states indicate that they are able to develop issue-specific power to make up for what they lack in aggregate structural power. Small states can, therefore, develop power disproportionate relative to their size on the few issues of utmost importance to them. In addition to prioritization, small states have successfully employed the strategies of coalition-building and image-building. Even though small state administrations lack the resources of their larger counterparts, their informality, flexibility, and the autonomy of their diplomats can prove advantageous in negotiations and within institutional settings."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thorhallsson|first=Baldur|last2=Steinsson|first2=Sverrir|date=2017-05-24|title=Small State Foreign Policy|url=http://politics.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-484|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Powers great and small ==
Almost all studies of power in international relations focus on great power politics and it will for this reason not be discussed here. For, as László Réczei noted, power status hinges on the capacity for violence: "If the notion of war were unknown in international relations, the definition of ‘small power’ would have no significance; just as in the domestic life of a nation it has no significance whether a man is less tall or has a weaker physique than his fellow citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Réczei, (1971). The Political Aims and Experiences of Small Socialist States. In Schou, A. &amp; Brundtland, A. O. (eds) Small States in International Relations. New York: Wiley Interscience Division, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the small-state studies that make up the backbone of the small power research tradition were carried out in the heyday of non-alignment by scholars such as David Vital,&lt;ref&gt;Vital, D. (1967). The Inequality of States: a Study of Small Power in International Relations. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Rothstein,&lt;ref&gt;Rothstein, R. L. (1968). Alliances and Small Powers. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Maurice East&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=East|first1=Maurice A.|title=Size and Foreign Policy Behavior: A Test of Two Models|journal=World Politics|date=1973|volume=25|issue=4|pages=556–576|doi=10.2307/2009952}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Keohane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keohane|first1=Robert O.|title=Lilliputians' Dilemmas: Small States in International Politics|journal=International Organization|date=1969|volume=23|issue=2|pages=291–310|doi=10.1017/S002081830003160X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weakening of the non-alignment movement during the 1970s coincided with a gradual decline in small-state studies, culminating in Peter Baehr’s critical appraisal of the research tradition in which he questioned smallness as a useful framework for analysis. The small-power category was first taken into serious account with David Mitrany’s study on world government (''pax oecumenica'') in 1933. Mitrany argued that the international community consisted only of two tiers of state powers: great and small.&lt;ref&gt;Mitrany, D. (1933). The Progress of International Government. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asle Toje]] takes a view where great powers and small powers distinguish themselves through patterns of behaviour. Small powers are not down scaled great powers – or oversized microstates.&lt;ref&gt;Toje, A. (2010). The European Union as a small power: After the post-Cold War. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining small powers ==
There is no one definition of small powers. Therefore, they have been defined in various ways. As Thorhallsson and Steinsson point out, shortage of the resources and capabilities that determine power and influence are central to most definitions of small powers.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The most common factor for defining state size, however, they continue is population size. Besides the size of population, other variables such as territory, economy, and military capabilities are also used.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Even though the most common factor for defining small powers is the size of the population, there is not an agreement of how populous states should be to be defined as small or middle powers. Although states with less than 10 or 15 million inhabitants are regarded as small by most academics, states with up to 30 million inhabitants are sometimes considered small.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Others, however, think of size as a relative concept where the influence of great powers is seen as far greater and the influence of middle powers moderately greater than those of small powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science: Servant or Master?|last=Morgenthau|first=Hans|publisher=New American Library|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, small states barely have the capabilities to influence the international system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keohane|first=Robert O.|date=April 1969|title=Lilliputians' Dilemmas: Small States in International Politics|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/div-classtitlelilliputiansandapos-dilemmas-small-states-in-internatinal-politicsdiv/5A92C8CA5EEB757F1C2C13D222E95E5E|journal=International Organization|volume=23|issue=2|pages=291–310|doi=10.1017/S002081830003160X|issn=1531-5088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of focusing solely on one factor, Thorhallsson proposes a framework that intertwines multiple factors. In that regard, factors such as fixed size (population and territory), sovereignty size (the degree to which a state controls its internal affairs and borders and is recognized), political size (military and administrative capabilities, domestic cohesion, and foreign policy consensus), economic size (GDP, market size, and development), perceptual size (how a state is perceived by internal or external actors), and preference size (the ideas, ambitions, and priorities of domestic elites regarding their role in the international system) are given equal value as opposed to just a single factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thorhallsson|first=Baldur|date=2006-03-01|title=The Size of States in the European Union: Theoretical and Conceptual Perspectives|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07036330500480490|journal=Journal of European Integration|volume=28|issue=1|pages=7–31|doi=10.1080/07036330500480490|issn=0703-6337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluating the size of a state ==
To answer the question of what constitutes a small state, many different criteria must be regarded. Many factors, both subjective and objective, can contribute to what is perceived as the size of a state, so there is no one entirely fulfilling definition. No matter how diverse criteria are used to define the size of states, no one method will suffice to group the states of the world today because of their diversity. For example, the easiest and most often used indicators of the size of a state, population and geographical area, already pose a problem if the world's states are to be grouped in two: small or large. In that case, extremely different countries like San Marino and Sweden on one hand and Italy and China on the other would get grouped together.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Archer|first=Clive|last2=Neill|first2=Nugent|date=2002|title=Introduction: Small States and EU|url=|journal=Current Politics and Economics of Europe|volume=11|pages=1–10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their article ''Introduction: Small states and the European Union'' Clive Archer and Neill Nugent mention Raimo Väyrynen’s definition of the axes along which the properties of small states had been measured in international relations literature by the time of Väyrynen’s survey’s publication in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Väyrynen|first=Raimo|date=1971|title=On the definition and measurement of small power status|url=|journal=Cooperation and Conflict|volume=VI|pages=91–102|via=|doi=10.1177/001083677100600203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not perfect, it remains useful now despite its age, to capture the different approaches used when small states are identified:

"One axis considers whether the factors involved are endogenous or exogenous: that is to say, whether the smallness lies in the internal aspects of a country itself (such as its population or Gross Domestic Product  [GDP] or in its relations with other states (such as the size of its armed forces or its alliance status). The other axis involves objective and subjective evaluations: that is, whether the smallness is seen in terms of ‘measureable’ elements (such as geographical area or size of the diplomatic corps) or ‘impressionistic’ elements (notably views held and/or expressed by practitioners and commentators either at home or abroad)."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the same paper, they mention the difficulty of categorizing a state as a small state based only on its size. They argue how the population size can determine the decision if a small state is considered small, but the actual parameters used for that approach can be rather complicated. They go on to explain how a state that has a population below one million falls into the category of a micro-state, but a state with a population over ten million would be better described as a medium-sized state. Also, that number is not necessarily the only one used for the measurement, mostly because of the similar sizes of some states. They use the examples of Central European states such as the Czech Republic and Hungary and the Benelux states, the original ten million margin would more logically be moved to twelve, so that it could include these countries on the small state spectrum. The exploration of these parameters is a big part of the small state debate, especially in Europe. The authors also mention the big difference between European, and for example Latin American or African countries. The states in Latin America unquestionably have larger populations, but that still does not really affect their placement in the category of small states, because their weakness in the international system is still noticeable and influences the way the states are seen as “small”. This is an important approach, since it makes it clear how aside from the geographical and population size, the country’s GDP, the ranking of a state in the international system, the political, economical and military power play an important role in putting a state somewhere on the spectrum.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Foreign policy of small states ==
Small states are usually more vulnerable to changes in the international system since they are more focused on survival than the bigger states. The costs of being exploited are way higher for small states and the effects of foreign-policy mistakes are much bigger, since the bigger states have a larger margin of time and error. So in some ways statesmen in small states have to watch more closely for external constraints. Using that reasoning, IR-theorists tend to believe that the foreign-policy of small states is more greatly influenced by the international system rather than their domestic politics.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elman|first=Miriam Fendius|date=April 1995|title=The foreign policies of small states: challenging neorealism in its own backyard|journal=British journal of political science|volume=25| issue =  2|pages=171–217|jstor=194084|doi=10.1017/s0007123400007146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miriam Fendius Elman talks about this in her article ''The foreign policies of small states: challenging neorealism in its own backyard'', adding that foreign policy of bigger states tends to be more influenced by their domestic politics:

“By contrast, domestic politics will necessarily play a greater role in an explanation of great power foreign policy. Generally speaking, great powers are faced with a lower level of external threat in comparison to small states and thus have more options for action. This increased range of choice will tend to make foreign policy formation more susceptible to domestic political influences. Consequently, unit level variables cannot be ignored when explaining great power foreign policy.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She continues to quote Snyder where he points out the importance of the size of state when its foreign policy is being analysed:

“Similarly, Snyder assumes that the study of small state and great power behaviour require different analytical foci. He points out that 'among the great powers, domestic pressures often outweigh international ones in the calculations of national leaders'.'1 Since great powers 'enjoy a substantial buffer from the pressures of international competition', domestic political explanations are good predictors of their foreign policy strategies. When studying the foreign policies of small states, Snyder does not expect domestic political theories to fit as well. Whereas 'great powers adapt their foreign strategies to their domestic circumstances', small states are more 'exposed to the vagaries of international security and economic competition'. Since small state foreign policy strategies will reflect an attentiveness to external exigencies, international/structural explanations should suffice.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

More and more research is being done specifically on small states, how they develop their foreign policy, and how they are at some level completely different from larger states. Authors Alyson J.K. Bailes, Bradley A. Thayer, and Baldur Thorhallsson make the argument that small states differ from larger states in how they form alliances in their article ''Alliance theory and alliance 'Shelter': the complexities of small state alliance behavior''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/23802014.2016.1189806 | volume=1 | title=Alliance theory and alliance ‘Shelter’: the complexities of small state alliance behaviour | year=2016 | journal=Third World Thematics: A TWQ Journal | pages=9–26 | last1 = Bailes | first1 = Alyson J. K. | last2 = Thayer | first2 = Bradley A. | last3 = Thorhallsson | first3 = Baldur}}&lt;/ref&gt; They acknowledge that small states are naturally more vulnerable than larger states, due to smaller militaries, economies, and overall population size. However, they also argue that small states are not without power, especially when viewed through the theory of alliance of shelter.

In comparison with the more traditional international relations view that small states will always be obligated to seek protection from more power neighboring states and form alliances with them, the theory of alliance of shelter expands on and differs from this claim and viewpoint in six key ways. 
# Shelter theory recognizes that small states are 'fundamentally different' that large states and therefore must act and make decisions using different logic. 
# The alliances that small states form reflect not only the international reasons why the alliance is necessary, but the domestic reasons as well. 
# Small states are able to benefit from alliances with larger states and reap greater relative gains than the larger state. 
# In order to survive and thrive, small states rely heavily on alliance of shelter theory. 
# Alliance of shelter theory allows small states to avoid isolation with the outside world using their alliances, which can have a profound social and cultural impact on the small state. 
# Due to these alliances, small states may undergo a transformation, both internationally and domestically, which can come at a high cost to the small state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uc-media.rhi.hi.is/tmp/uqjri/3a._Bailes%2C_Thayer_and_Thorhallsson___Alliance_Theory.pdf|title=Alliance theory and alliance 'Shelter': the complexities of small state alliance behavior|last=Thorhallsson|first=Baldure|date=10/08/16|website=|accessdate=}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}{{Clarify|reason=ambiguous date format|date=January 2018}}{{dead link|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Baldur Thorhallsson and Alyson J. K. Bailes take the shelter theory even further and talk about how small states have three vulnerabilities, political, economic and societal. 
# ''Political shelter'' is all about power, be it military or diplomatic. When a state does not have the sources to defend itself, it means that it lacks hard power, for example military, and diplomatic power which means poor administrative capacity. Therefore, is it essential for the small states to "be sheltered by the norms and rules of the international system."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/980017415|title=Security in a small nation Scotland, democracy, politics|others=Neal, Andrew W., 1978-|isbn=9781783742707|location=Cambridge|oclc=980017415}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''Economic shelter'' is very important for small states, it means having economic assistance, access to a common market and even beneficial loans amongst other factors, and it can be from an organisation or another state. In fact, "small domestic markets and concentrated production make small states acutely dependent on international trade."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
# ''Societal shelter'' is about identity and being recognised by others. Unfortunately, "small states risk cultural, educational and technological stagnation without the free flow of people, goods and ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economy, territory, identity: Politics of West European Peripheries|last=Rokkan, Urwin,|first=S., D.W.|publisher=Sage|year=1983|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is why it is not only important but necessary for small states to rely on others in order to prevent stagnation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 
It needs to be taken into account that these vulnerabilities come with a cost if small states look towards shelter by either organisations or larger states. The agreements small states have to make need to be beneficial for both them and the state providing the shelter, although the costs may differ between states. It is not always easy for the small states to negotiate on beneficial terms because "shelter providers may impose conditions on smaller states in exchange for the shelter, reducing the small partner’s freedom of manoeuvre and choice."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It is to be noted though that in Europe there are various important and inexpensive shelters available for small states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/980017415|title=Security in a small nation Scotland, democracy, politics|last=Thorhallsson, Bailes|first=Baldur, Alyson J.K.|publisher=Open book Publishers|others=Neal, Andrew W., 1978-|year=1983|isbn=9781783742707|location=Cambridge|pages=53, 54|oclc=980017415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of small powers==
Though a single definition has proved elusive due to the number of potential variables and their particular interpretation under given conditions, [[Asle Toje]] claims to have found recurring traits in the research literature regarding the behavioural patterns of small powers on the international stage:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toje|first1=Asle|title=The European Union as a Small Power|journal=JCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies|date=2010|volume=49|issue=1|pages=43–60|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5965.2010.02128.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The strategic behaviour of small powers is characterized by dependence. A small power recognizes that it cannot obtain security by relying solely on its own capabilities.  They cannot affect the international system alone but with some concerted effort they can affect the way the system works.  A small power plays a dispensable and non-decisive part in a great power’s array of political and military resources. Small powers therefore tend towards a policy of either strict neutrality or alliance.  Those ‘located in geopolitical regions critical to maintaining a great power’s position in the international system [tend] to opt for alliance’.  In an alliance, small powers tend to follow the alliance leader closely, lend it what support they can and avoid antagonizing it.  Under regional hegemony with a low probability of punishment, small powers tend to adopt neutrality.
# Small powers display variable geometry. In terms of military capabilities there is no ability to project power on a global scale. They are forced by their limited resources, their location and by the international system itself to establish clear priorities.  To this end, they identify a hierarchy of risks and attempt to internationalize those considered to be most serious.  Small power policies, argues David Vital, are aimed at altering the external environment by ‘reducing an unfavourable discrepancy in strength, broadening the field of manoeuvre and choice, and increasing the total resources on which the state can count in times of stress’.&lt;ref&gt;Vital, D. (1967) The Inequality of States: A Study of Small Power in International Relations, Oxford: Oxford University Press. p.134&lt;/ref&gt;  Small powers are therefore status quo oriented. They work within the established order rather than attempting to revise the order itself. 
# Small powers are the primary beneficiaries of international institutions and are, by necessity, lovers of the law.  A small power will often seek to minimize the costs of conducting foreign policy and will increase the weight behind its policies by engaging in concerted efforts with other actors. Generally, this leads to a high degree of participation in and support for international organizations, which leads to a tendency to adopt ‘moral’ or ‘normative’ policy positions.  Formal rules are actively encouraged in order to curb the great powers and strengthen their own position.
# Small powers are risk averse. They see more dangers than opportunities in international politics, which leads them both to shun system-upholding tasks and to display a penchant for token participation in such endeavours. [[Zaki Laidi]] defines a risk averse power as an international actor that ‘defines and responds to the political states of a given identified risk in terms of a will to reduce its uncertainties and uncontrollable effects’.&lt;ref&gt;Laïdi, Z. (2010) Europe as a Risk Averse Power – A hypothesis, Garnet Policy Brief No. 11, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the risks of extermination when challenging more powerful states, their ambitions are generally ‘defensive’.  They have a narrow range of interests and little freedom of activity. [[Annette Baker Fox]] sees small powers as being geographically bound in the sense that their demands are restricted to their own and immediately adjacent areas, while great powers exert their influence on a global scale.  Subsequently, small power strategic behaviour is characterized by a general reluctance to coerce and a tendency to promote multilateral, non-military solutions to security challenges.”&lt;ref&gt;Fox, A. B. (1959) The Power of Small States: Diplomacy in World War Two, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 3, fn. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Small powers in international organizations ==
Small states can under some circumstances have a disproportionately great influence. According to Diana Panke, "Small states tend to be most likely to punch above their weight if the negotiations take place in an institutionalised arena with majority-based decision-making rules in which each state has one vote or in contexts in which decisions are made unanimously, if they are selective in negotiations and concentrate their capacities on the most important issues, engage in capacity-building activities to maximise their ideational resources, if they make use of institutional opportunity structures such as chairing meetings and engaging in agenda-setting, and if they individually or collectively apply persuasion strategies from early on".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Small states in multilateral negotiations. What have we learned?|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09557571.2012.710589|journal = Cambridge Review of International Affairs|date = 2012-09-01|issn = 0955-7571|pages = 387–398|volume = 25|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/09557571.2012.710589|first = Diana|last = Panke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the states in the world can be considered small states, but somehow there is less than ideal information about the activities of small states within international organisations particularly when it comes to influencing policy outcomes

Small states encounter '''size-related obstacles''' in different negotiation settings (the negotiation settings ranging between everything from the UN and the EU to the WTO) as well as in capacity-building and shaping strategies used to influence negotiation outcomes.

A size-related obstacle would for example be the EU which uses a system of weighted voting, which gives bigger states a greater political leverage than smaller states. On the other and a lot of International Organisations use a “one state, one vote” principle which may appear to secure equality between states of various sizes. However, even if the formal voting itself is equal what happens in the background is not. Small states face size-related difficulties during negotiation processes in IO’s such as the UN because they often possess fewer administrative, financial and economic resources, which hinders them in participating in the negotiation process at the same level as the larger states. They are simply spread too thin across various issues and therefore resort to concentrating all their resources towards the issue of highest significance. Therefore, small states are forced to choose between their interests in negotiations. They also produce better results if they use persuasion based strategies rather than bargaining ones because they lack bargaining leverage.

In addition, delegates from smaller states tend to have speaking points for fewer issues and smaller budgets than the delegates from the larger nations; This gives the larger states a better position to influence outcomes both in weighted and equal weight voting systems.

There is a number of ways that small states can try to counter size-related obstacles.

(Small states can engage in '''capacity-building,''' for example through contacts with or through joining coalitions. Capacity building can increase a state’s ideational capacities and amplify the effectiveness of persuasion-based strategies.

Coalitions have burden-sharing effects and can increase the discursive leverage of its members

Secondly small states can also use '''shaping strategies.''' Shaping strategies can include either legal, moral or normative argumentation applied in different negotiation settings. Framing and reframing is for example important for small states if there is a high number of delegations participating in the negotiations.

These strategies help small states compete, but they are not always enough for them to compete successfully.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panke|first=Diana|date=2012-09-01|title=Small states in multilateral negotiations. What have we learned?|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09557571.2012.710589|journal=Cambridge Review of International Affairs|volume=25|issue=3|pages=387–398|doi=10.1080/09557571.2012.710589|issn=0955-7571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of a small power can be very important for its survival. If a small power is working as a so call "buffer state" between two bigger rival power then it is more likely for that state to cease to exist&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fazal|first=Tanisha M.|date=April 2004|title=State Death in the International System|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/state-death-in-the-international-system/293E2E30C054DEE72899DAAA643B61AD|journal=International Organization|volume=58|issue=2|pages=311–344|doi=10.1017/s0020818304582048|issn=1531-5088}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the buffer location can decrease the likelihood of a small powers survival does not mean that a state can't use its buffer location as an advantage. In the cod wars (a fishing dispute over a 20-year period between Iceland and the UK) the micro nation of Iceland was able to use both its small size and location as an advantage and won the conflict. One of the reasons is the threat by Icelandic authorities to leave NATO and kick the US defence force out of the country. When we look at the dispute from a Neoclassical realist perspective we can see that Icelandic statesmen put the core security in danger witch could spark up a huge tension in the North Atlantic area. When we turn our focus to the UK, it seems that they were not willing to go as far as the Icelandic government to win the dispute even though they had the military power to do so. According to Sverrir Steinsson, it seems that the simple liberal explanation is not enough on its own to explain the difference between the nations in a satisfactory way. Even though many Icelandic officials did not want to leave NATO over the fishing dispute, they had enormous pressure from the public to do so if the dispute would not end, while the UK had much less public pressure over the issue. According to Steinsson´s result it seems that small powers are much more affected by domestic view then bigger powers witch can increase the chances of a small state leaving an international organisation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinsson|first=Sverrir|date=2017-07-01|title=Neoclassical Realism in the North Atlantic: Explaining Behaviors and Outcomes in the Cod Wars|url=https://academic.oup.com/fpa/article/13/3/599/3075280/Neoclassical-Realism-in-the-North-Atlantic|journal=Foreign Policy Analysis|volume=13|issue=3|pages=599–617|doi=10.1093/fpa/orw062|issn=1743-8586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Small states' power ==
Small states’ power can be categorized as ''particular-intrinsic'', “''derivative''” and ''collective''. Through one of these three types of power can small states best seek their needs and interest. Middle or great powers are not precluded from these types of power, only the limitations of the small states force them to rely on them more. Small states have different goals and different bases, i.e. ideational, material and relational bases. Bases are the resources that a state has and can exploit in order to effect another’s behavior. This variation of small states’ bases lead to a variety of means of power. Means in this context are the ways a state utilizes its base. The three categories of power all have different bases and therefore different means, best understood as small states’ properties and its actions.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Long|first=Tom|date=2016|title=Small States, Great Power? Gaining Influence Through Intrinsic, Derivative, and Collective Power|url=|journal=International Studies Review|volume=0|pages=1–21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Particular-Intrinsic Power''

Small states lack many of the factors that usually determine capability. Some may however possess a particular form of intrinsic power. Particular-intrinsic resources can serve as the base of small states’ power but the resources will only gain importance through the states actions. For example, small states may rely on their strategic location or material possessions. Identity can also be a potential base for the exercise of power.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

''Derivative Power''

Small states that lack material capabilities can try to persuade larger states to take actions that will increase their interests and thus derive power. In this category of power the base is the relationship between the great power and the small state. The means of this power will depend on the small states’ goals and the type of relationship it has with the larger state. In a friendly relationship, for example, there can be the possibility for an access to policy discourses.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

''Collective Power''

The base of collective power is the relationship a small state has to other small states. This type of power can be achieved through single-issue groupings, institutionalism or by leveraging allies in pursuance of one state’s cause.  Furthermore, collective power can be either institutional or compulsory. A collective power is compulsory when a large state is directly pressured by small states to change its policies through promises or threats. Institutions can provide small states with protection and a voice. They can provide the ability for small states to influence rules and be used to broaden norms in the international field. International organizations are particularly useful for small states in terms of norm promoting activities.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== The effect of industrial sectors on small (Nordic) states behaviour ==

Since small states are more dependent on their leading economic sector more than larger states. The [[Nordic states]] of [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] have sought shelter in the [[European Union]] while the remaining others, [[Iceland]] and [[Norway]], do not. The five Nordic states have differences that are important to their industrial structures as Lars Mjoset, a Norwegian political economist, pointed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mjoset|first=Lars|date=1987|title=Nordic Economic Policies in the 1970s and 1980s|url=|journal=International Organization|volume=41|issue=3|doi=10.1017/s0020818300027533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nordic Dagen Denpå|last=Mjoset|first=Lars|publisher=Norwegian University Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Oslo|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ingebritsen noted that: Each Nordic government had to respond to a different set of interest groups – some that anticipated positive benefits of European integration and others that anticipated undesirable costs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nordic States and European Unity|last=Ingebritsen|first=Christine|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|year=1998|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major differences is how dependant nations are on their raw materials and manufacturing production.

For example, Iceland is a nation that is heavily dependent on fishing as its main export&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nordic States and European Unity|last=Ingebritsen|first=Christine|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore seeks to protect its fisheries. If Iceland would join the EU it would have to share the market as well as its fishing grounds with for example Spain and Portugal. ‘ In Iceland, fishing is a strategic sector: the interests of fishermen are synonymous with government policy goals. Icelanders are uncompromising when it comes to fish’ (ibid, p.&amp;nbsp;127). This can be seen in more recent events when the Icelandic government put membership to the EU to a national vote following the financial crisis, in which the Icelandic people voted ‘no’ – the fisheries being the too great of a risk factor following membership (ibid).

However, Norway is in a much stronger position in the international community  with less dependency on the ‘internationally oreinted manufacturing sector and more reliant on a single industry for its export revenue: the petroleum sector’ (ibid, p.&amp;nbsp;129). Norwegians hold power with their petroleum sector and have access to important markets for petroleum in Europe without having to join the EU (ibid, p.&amp;nbsp;130).

Denmark joined the EC in 1973 although with agriculture being the dominant sector at the time, however in recent years manufactured goods have become the largest sector for the Danish national income. (ibid, p.&amp;nbsp;122).  Danes remained quite supportive and optimistic about the EC with even the support of Trade Unions: The trade union movement supports the completion of the internal market’; ‘including the removal of the technical and physical barriers to trade, and the liberalization of competition within the EC’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Internal Market and the Social Dimension|last=|first=|publisher=The Danish Federation of Trade Unions|year=1989|isbn=|location=Copenhagen|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Iceland, Danish farmers welcomed the competition and access to more markets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nordic States and European Unity|last=Ingebritsen|first=Christine|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this the Danes have remained active in judging new treaties in the EC/EU and been very observant for national interests, for example by voting no to the Maastricth Treaty on June 2, 1992. However, it did not affect the Danes in the long run and they did sign the treaty eventually.

,,Sectoral differences between the Nordic applicants to the EC in the 1970s (Norway and Denmark) can account for the reason why the Danes decided to enter the EC and the Norwegian goernent failed to achieve a majority in favor of joining the EC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nordic States and European Unity|last=Ingebritsen|first=Christine|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden was also very pro-EC and joined in 1995. The Swedish industry had been international for a long time but after moving a lot of their operations into the European markets the businesses managed to convince the government it was in the national interest to follow their example. Such active, well coordinated deep integration outside Sweden was only seen in Finland who embraced the EC into the roots of society (ibid, pp.&amp;nbsp;143–144).

{{Refimprove|date=April 2014}}
'''Spirit of place''' (or soul) refers to the unique, distinctive and cherished aspects of a place; often those celebrated by artists and writers, but also those cherished in [[Folklore|folk tales]], [[festival]]s and celebrations. It is thus as much in the invisible weave of culture ([[folklore|stories]], art, memories, beliefs, histories, etc.) as it is the tangible physical aspects of a place ([[monument]]s, boundaries, [[river]]s, [[woodland|woods]], architectural style, [[rural crafts]] styles, pathways, [[Vista (landscaping)|views]], and so on) or its [[interpersonal]] aspects (the presence of [[Kinship|relatives]], [[friendship|friends]] and kindred spirits, and the like).{{cn|date=December 2016}}

Often the term is applied to a rural or a relatively unspoiled or regenerated place &amp;mdash; whereas the very similar term [[sense of place]] would tend to be more domestic, [[urbanist|urban]], or [[suburban]] in tone. For instance, one could logically apply 'sense of place' to an urban high street; noting the [[architecture]], the width of the [[road]]s and [[Sidewalk|pavement]]s, the [[plants|plantings]], the style of the [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shop]]-fronts, the [[street furniture]], and so on, but one could not really talk about the 'spirit of place' of such an essentially urban and commercial environment. However, an urban area that looks faceless or neglected to an adult may have deep meaning in [[children's street culture]].{{or|date=December 2016}}

The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] term for spirit of place was [[Genius loci]], by which it is sometimes still referred. This has often been historically envisaged as a guardian [[animal]] or a small supernatural being ([[puck (mythology)|puck]], [[fairy]], [[elf]], and the like) or a [[ghost]]. In the developed world these beliefs have been, for the most part, discarded. A new layer of less-embodied superstition on the subject, however, has arisen around [[ley lines]], [[feng shui]] and similar concepts, on the one hand, and urban leftover spaces, such as back alleys or gaps between buildings in some North-American downtown areas, on the other hand.&lt;ref&gt;A. Akkerman and A.F. Cornfeld (2010) "Greening as an urban design metaphor: Looking for the city's soul in leftover spaces," The ''[https://www.usask.ca/structurist/ Structurist]'' 49/50: 30-35&lt;/ref&gt;

The western cultural movements of [[Romanticism]] and [[Neo-romanticism]] are often deeply concerned with creating cultural forms that 're-enchant the land', in order to establish or re-establish a spirit of place.&lt;ref&gt;T. Graves and L. Poraj-Wilezynska (2009) "'Spirit of place' as process: Archaeography, dowsing and perceptual mapping at Belas Knap," ''[http://www.bergpublishers.com/BergJournals/TimeMind/tabid/3253/Default.aspx Time and Mind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123161318/http://www.bergpublishers.com/BergJournals/TimeMind/tabid/3253/Default.aspx |date=2010-11-23 }}'' 2: 167-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[earth art]] (sometimes called environment art) artists such as [[Andy Goldsworthy]] have explored the contribution of natural/ephemeral sculpture to spirit of place.&lt;ref&gt;B. E.

==Spirit of Place Symposia==

Between 1988 and 1993, five annual Spirit of Place Symposiums were produced by environmental psychologist James Swan and Roberta Swan, in the United States and Japan. The programs sought to explore the relationship between ancient wisdom about the importance of a sense or spirit of a place, and modern science and design. The programs—held in Davis, CA; Grace Cathedral, San Francisco' Mesa Verde National Park; Tenri, Japan; and San Rafael, CA—featured over 350 speakers, including scientists, designers, and representatives of natives cultures. They also included concerts by Paul Horn, Anna Halprin, [[Steven Halpern]], and R. Carlos Nakai. The five programs attracted an audience of 10,000, and featured on national TV in the United States and Japan. The 1992 symposium held in Tenri, Japan, was the largest environmental conference in Japan that year. Representatives of 20 different American Indian tribes, Ainu, Inuit, Aborigine, and African traditional cultures were speakers in the series. Two anthologies edited by James and Roberta Swan, ''The Power of Place'' (Quest, 1991) and ''Dialogues with the Living Earth'' (Quest, 1996) present a selection of presentations at the Spirit of Place Symposiums.

The '''Tehuantepec Ridge''' is a linear undersea ridge located off the west coast of Mexico in the Pacific Ocean.  It is the remnant of an old [[fracture zone]], and not a [[tectonic]] spreading center ridge (''see'' [[mid-ocean ridge]]).  It extends from the eastern end of the [[Clipperton Fracture Zone]] northeastward toward Mexico into [[Chiapas]] and [[El Chichón]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027308001662 | doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2008.02.028 | volume=175 | issue=4 | title=On the origin of El Chichón volcano and subduction of Tehuantepec Ridge: A geodynamical perspective | journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research | pages=459–471| date=2008-08-20 | last1=Manea | first1=Marina | last2=Manea | first2=Vlad C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; until it is subducted into the [[Middle America Trench]].  It lies within the tectonic [[Cocos Plate]], separating the lower and older seafloor of the Guatemala Basin which lies southeast of the ridge from higher and younger seafloor which lies to its northwest.

Current research indicates that the ridge was formed as a [[fracture zone]] and [[transform fault]] along the [[East Pacific Rise]].  As a result of a change in the motion of the [[Pacific Plate]] about 13 million years ago, there was also a change in the orientation of the East Pacific Rise, which in turn reoriented the fracture zone, creating the current alignment that is today's Clipperton Fracture Zone.  The Tehuantepec Ridge preserves the previous orientation.

Some researchers have hypothesized that the subducted portion of the Tehuantepec Ridge under Mexico is responsible for the existence of [[El Chichón]] volcano as well as the other volcanoes of what is called the Chiapanecan Volcanic Arc.  Studies of the 1982 eruption of El Chichón indicated its erupted output was unusual compared to other volcanoes in the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] which lies well to the northwest.  The anomaly is thought to result from the distinctive composition of the rocks which comprise the Tehuantepec Ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Vlad C.

Womyn's lands, as well as lesbian separatism, have generated a wide range of criticisms. These criticism center around, but are not limited to, the lack of acceptance by many residents of [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] women; the exclusion of [[Trans woman|transgender]] and [[transsexual]] women for not being [[Biological sex|biological]] females;&lt;ref name="Browne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kershaw" /&gt; ideological conflicts with local communities that include violence and threats of violence targeting residents of womyn's land;&lt;ref name="Lynch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reno" /&gt; and local community concerns about social change, e.g. rising divorce rates&lt;ref name="Sokolow" /&gt; and expanded lesbian visibility.&lt;ref name="Lynch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=Kate|date=2003|title=Fear and Loathing in Mississippi: The Attack on Camp Sister Spirit|journal=[[Journal of Lesbian Studies]]|volume=7|issue=2|pages=85–106|issn=1089-4160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of present-day womyn's lands include Hawk Hill Community Land Trust, HOWL, Susan B.

== Background history ==
=== Sanctificationists a.k.a. Woman's Commonwealth ===
Founded in the late 1870s to early 1880s, the Sanctificationists, later known as the Woman's Commonwealth, were a women's land-based commune first established in Belton, Texas.&lt;ref name="Sanctified" /&gt; The community was originally established by Martha McWhirter and her women's bible study group on land that was inherited when the women's husbands died or quit the home. Residents of the commune were women and their dependent children; many of the women fled abusive homes to join the community. The Sisters embraced first wave feminist ideologies, and sought spiritual, economic, and social equality for women.&lt;ref name="Kitch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kitch|first1=Sally|title=The Woman's Commonwealth: Celibacy and Women's Rights|journal=[[Communities (magazine)|Communities]]|date=Spring 1994|issue=82|pages=40–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, they practiced celibacy as a way to liberate women from the spiritual degradation of heterosexual intercourse, the oppressive needs of children and child rearing, and male violence.&lt;ref name="Kitch" /&gt; The Sanctificationists were economically successful; they ran several boarding houses, two hotels, formed holding companies to manage their properties, and operated two farms to provide food for their multiple dining rooms. At one point, there were between 42 and 50 women members on record,&lt;ref name="Kitch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanctified" /&gt; including at least one African American woman who is thought to be a former slave.&lt;ref name="Sanctified" /&gt; In 1899, the entire commune moved to Washington, DC where they opened boarding houses, a hotel, and participated in urban feminist organizations.&lt;ref name="Kitch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sokolow"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sokolow|first1=Jayme A.|last2=Lamanna|first2=Mary Ann|title=Women and Utopia: The Woman's Commonwealth of Belton, Texas|jstor=30236969|journal=The Southwestern Historical Quarterly|date=April 1984|volume=87|issue=4|pages=371–392|oclc=01766223}}&lt;/ref&gt; McWhirter died in 1904, and the commune began a slow decline. In 1917, there were six remaining members who purchased a farm in rural Maryland to provide food for their urban dining halls, and to provide a pastoral retreat for themselves in a rural landscape. The last member of the commune died in 1983 at the age of 101.&lt;ref name="Sokolow" /&gt;

A brief article published in the [[List of lesbian periodicals in the United States|lesbian separatist periodical]], ''Austindyke (''alternately spelled as ''Austin Dyke),'' in 1979 and then reprinted in ''Sisters United'' in 1980 described the Woman's Commonwealth as a forerunner of the lesbian land movement.&lt;ref&gt;Peticolas, Anne. (1980). "Reclaiming hystory: The Belton Sanctificationists."

[[Radical feminism]] advocates for the elimination of female [[oppression]] through a call towards social and political transformation of patriarchal society.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Jone Johnson|title=What Is Radical Feminism?|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-radical-feminism-3528997|website=[[ThoughtCo]]|date=June 6, 2005|accessdate=April 27, 2017}} (Updated August 15, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Radical feminism grew out of other radical movements during the 1960s such as the [[Anti-war movement|Anti-War Movement]].&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; Women who took part in these radical movements felt under-represented in comparison to the men, which contributed to the formation of [[second-wave feminism]] and radical feminism.&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt;

[[Radical feminism#Theory and ideology|Radical feminist ideology]] is different from [[Feminist movements and ideologies#Mainstream feminism|mainstream]] or [[liberal feminism]] because it believes that [[women's liberation]] can only be achieved through the re-ordering of patriarchal society, while mainstream/liberal feminism seeks equality within the current system in place.&lt;ref name="Echols"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Echols|first=Alice|title=Daring To Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America 1967-1975|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|year=1989|pages=6–7|isbn=978-0816617869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical feminism also focuses on [[sex]] as the root of female oppression, as opposed to [[social class]] and/or [[race (human categorization)|race]].&lt;ref name="Echols" /&gt; Notable radical feminist groups and organizations include [[Cell 16]], [[Redstockings]], The Radical Feminists #28 and [[The Furies Collective]].&lt;ref name="Napikoski"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Napikoski|first1=Linda|title=Redstockings Radical Feminist Group|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/redstockings-womens-liberation-group-3528981|website=[[ThoughtCo]]|date=December 30, 2009|accessdate=April 28, 2017}} (Updated May 4, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bess" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Thomas|first=June|title=The National Register of Historic Places Adds Its First Lesbian Landmark|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2016/05/06/furies_collective_joins_national_register_of_historic_places.html|date=May 6, 2016|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shugar1"/&gt;

=== Lesbian separatism and separatist spaces ===
Lesbian separatism is rooted in the idea that women should and must exist separately from men in order to achieve a true feminist [[utopia]].&lt;ref name="Shugar1" /&gt; Lesbian separatist ideology has changed over time as the Radical Feminist Movement continued in its development. In the earlier stages of lesbian separatism the term "lesbian separatist" was considered synonymous to the term "radical feminist".&lt;ref name="Shugar1" /&gt; However, as each group developed distinct ideologies, tension formed between radical feminists and lesbian separatists.&lt;ref name="Shugar1" /&gt; Lesbian separatists used the separatist ideology as a way to "test one's feminist commitment",&lt;ref name="Shugar1" /&gt; which resulted in a divide.

An increase in [[lesbian feminism]] essays and papers centered around the subject of lesbian separatism, influenced and shaped lesbian separatist ideology as well.&lt;ref name="Shugar1" /&gt; Influential works which helped shape lesbian separatism included ''Lesbian Separatism: Amazon Analysis,'' the ''Collective Lesbian International Terrorists Papers,'' and [[Cell 16]]'s ''No More Fun and Games: A Journal of Female Liberation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Dunbar|editor1-first=Roxanne|editor2-last=Densmore|editor2-first=Dana|editor3-last=Warrior|editor3-first=Betsy |title=No More Fun and Games: a Journal of Female Liberation|url=https://dukelibraries.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15957coll6/id/132/rec/1|date=February 1969|volume=1|issue=2|publisher=[[Cell 16]]|via=[[Duke University Libraries]]}} ("No. 1" in Duke Library title is incorrect.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shugar1" /&gt;

Lesbian separatism is not only practiced and utilized in communal areas such as womyn's lands; it is also practiced in separatist events and [[women-only space]]s. One example of a feminist separatist event (the invited participants were womyn-born-womyn, girls of all ages, boys 10 and under) is the [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]].&lt;ref name="Browne"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Browne|first1=Kath|title=Womyn's Separatist Spaces: Rethinking Spaces of Difference and Exclusion|jstor=40270736|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|date=October 2009|volume=34|issue=4|pages=541–556|issn=0020-2754}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[music festival]] was held in [[Michigan]] every year from 1976 to 2015.&lt;ref name="Blade"&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Lori|title=Womyn's Rite: Annual Michigan Fest roared for 40 years|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/Music-Theater-Dance/2015/08/16/Womyn-s-Rite-Annual-Michigan-Fest-roared-for-40-years.html|website=[[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|The Blade]]|date=August 16, 2015|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by women for the purpose of establishing an annual [[safe space|safe]], [[social space]] dedicated for [[Lesbianism|lesbians]] and females alike.&lt;ref name="Blade" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Browne" /&gt; The Michigan Womyn's Music Festival embraced a separatist ideology by not permitting men, male children, or transgender women to participate in the festival.&lt;ref name="Browne" /&gt;

==== Significance to feminist thought and woman-based communities ====
Feminist ideology maintains that the patriarchal institutions and social norms which make up [[society]] are the source of [[Sexism|female oppression]].&lt;ref name="Shugar2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shugar|first=Dana R.|title=Separatism and Women's Community|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|year=1995|page=42|isbn=978-0803242449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbian separatist ideology recognizes the [[oppression]] which results from patriarchal society, however, it asserts that the root of oppression derives from men themselves, individually and as a group.&lt;ref name="Shugar2" /&gt; Unlike [[feminism]], lesbian separatism views men as the main source of their oppression.&lt;ref name="Frye"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frye|first1=Marilyn|title=Politics of Reality: Essays in Feminist Theory|date=1983|publisher=[[Crossing Press]]|edition=1st|chapter="Some Reflections on Separatism and Power"|isbn=978-0895940995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this ideology, many lesbian separatists consider men as the sole perpetrators of adverse [[Economic inequality|economic]], societal, and [[Culture|cultural]] issues which affect them.&lt;ref name="Shugar2" /&gt; As a result, lesbian separatists sought to construct autonomous Womyn's land communities where they could live [[Sex segregation|segregated]] from men entirely.&lt;ref name="Shugar2" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Womyn's land communities have been targeted for criticism. In the 1880s, the citizens of Belton, Texas blamed the Sanctificationists (also known as the Woman's Commonwealth) for rising separation and divorce rates, and of undermining the meaning of marriage through their practice of celibacy.&lt;ref name="Sokolow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KitchStrange"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kitch|first1=Sally L.|title=This Strange Society of Women: Reading the Letters and Lives of the Women's Commonwealth|date=1992|publisher=[[Ohio State University Press]]|edition=1st|isbn=978-0814205792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, residents of Camp Sister Spirit, located in rural [[Ovett, Mississippi]], were criticized by local community leaders including Southern Baptist ministers, Jones County Deputy Sheriff Myron Holifield, and US Representative Michael Parker, who held well-attended town hall meetings and a fundraiser to raise money to force the camp to close.&lt;ref name="Lynch"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Thomas P.|date=Winter 1995|title=Camp Sister Spirit: A retreat under siege|journal=Mediation Quarterly|volume=13|issue=2|pages=151–163|issn=1536-5581|doi=10.1002/crq.3900130208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reno"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Reno Sends Mediators To Mississippi As Lesbian-Run Camp Divides Town|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/02/19/reno-sends-mediators-to-mississippi-as-lesbian-run-camp-divides-town/761c8412-5a08-499b-9eab-7de04dd5c090/|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=February 19, 1994|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reverend John S.

Lesbian separatist communities have been criticized for exclusionary policies towards [[Trans woman|transgender]], [[transsexual]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] women.&lt;ref name="Browne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kershaw" /&gt; Usually, [[homosexual]] females are the only persons permitted to be a member of these communities.&lt;ref name="Kershaw" /&gt; Some womyn's lands have also been criticized for excluding [[women of color]] and [[working class]] lesbians.&lt;ref name="Shugar3"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shugar|first=Dana R.|title=Separatism and Women's Community|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|year=1995|pages=xi–50|isbn=978-0803242449}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, lesbian separatist communities were also accused of being a privilege offered solely to the few who could afford the closed-off [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].&lt;ref name="Shugar3" /&gt;
