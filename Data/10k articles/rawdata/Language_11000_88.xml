'''Abenaki''', or '''Abnaki''', is an endangered [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] of [[Quebec]] and the northern states of [[New England]]. The language has Eastern and Western forms, which differ in vocabulary and [[phonology]], and are sometimes considered distinct languages.

Eastern Abenaki languages are spoken by several peoples, including the [[Mi'kmaq]], [[Maliseet]], [[Passamaquoddy]], and [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]] of coastal Maine. The last known natively fluent speaker of Penobscot, Madeline Shay, died in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penobscot |work=Native Languages of the Americas |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |url=http://www.native-languages.org/penobscot.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eastern Abnaki language |work=[[Ethnologue]] |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aaq |accessdate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several Penobscot elders still speak Penobscot, and there is an ongoing effort to preserve it and teach it in the local schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abbe Museum: Penobscot | accessdate=Feb 21, 2016 |url=http://www.abbemuseum.org/headline-news/Language/HeadlineNewsLanguage%20Penobscot.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other dialects of Eastern Abenaki, such as ''Caniba'' and ''Aroosagunticook'', are documented in French-language materials from the colonial period.

In 1991, Western Abenaki was spoken by 20 individuals along the [[St. Lawrence River]] between [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]], mostly at [[Odanak]], the site of the former mission village of St. Francis, and by about 50 individuals living throughout [[New York (state)|New York]] state and [[Connecticut]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} By 2006 five speakers were recorded.&lt;ref name="e16" /&gt;

==History==
In ''[[Reflections in Bullough's Pond]]'', historian [[Diana Muir]] argues that Abenaki neighbors, the pre-contact [[Iroquois]], were an imperialist, expansionist culture whose cultivation of the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|corn/beans/squash agricultural complex]] enabled them to support a large population. They made war primarily against neighboring [[Algonquian peoples]], including the Abenaki. Muir uses archaeological data to argue that the Iroquois expansion onto Algonquian lands was checked by the Algonquian adoption of agriculture. This enabled them to support their own populations large enough to have sufficient warriors to defend against the threat of Iroquois conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Muir, Diana, ''Reflections in Bullough's Pond'', University Press of New England.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2013}}

In 1614, six years before the Mayflower, an English captain, [[Thomas Hunt (slaver)|Thomas Hunt]], captured 24 young Abenaki people from what would later become Massachusetts and took them to Europe to sell as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bourne | first=Russell | title= The Red King's Rebellion, Racial Politics in New England 1675-1678 | year= 1990 | isbn= 0-689-12000-1 |page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when the Mayflower landed and the English began to establish colonies in the southern end of Abenaki territory, relations between the English and natives remained guarded. Especially, the religious leaders of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] discouraged social interaction with the natives. By contrast, the French had already planted the colonies of [[New France]] in the northern part of Abenaki territory, and maintained reasonably cordial relations with the natives. Intermarriage between the French and natives gave rise to the [[Métis]] people. Over the next hundred years, European conflicts between the French and the English often included their colonies and their respective native allies. The French treated their Abenaki allies with some respect; in 1709, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] knighted Chief [[Nescambious|Assacumbuit]] for his service, thus elevating him as a member of the French nobility.

Facing annihilation from English attacks and [[epidemic]]s of new infectious diseases, the southern Abenaki started to emigrate to Quebec around 1669. The governor of [[New France]] allocated two [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneuries]] (large self-administered areas similar to feudal fiefs). The first was on the [[Saint-François River|Saint Francis River]] and is now known as the ''[[Odanak]]'' Indian Reservation; the second was founded near [[Bécancour, Quebec|Bécancour]] and is called the ''[[Wolinak]]'' Indian Reservation.

===Abenaki wars===
{{main|French and Indian Wars}}
When the [[Wampanoag]] under [[Metacomet]], also called "King Philip", fought the English colonists in [[New England]] in 1675 in [[King Philip's War]], the Abenaki joined the Wampanoag. For three years there was fighting along the Maine frontier in the [[First Abenaki War]]. The Abenaki pushed back the line of white settlement by devastating raids on scattered farmhouses and small villages. The war was settled by a peace treaty in 1678.

During [[Queen Anne's War]] in 1702, the Abenaki were allied with the French; they raided numerous small villages in Maine, from [[Wells, Maine|Wells]] to [[Portland, Maine|Casco]], killing about 300 settlers over ten years. The raids stopped when the war ended. Some captives were adopted into the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] and Abenaki tribes; older captives were generally ransomed, and the colonies carried on a brisk trade.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Morrison, ''The Embattled Northeast: the Elusive Ideal of Alliance in Abenaki-Euramerican Relations'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Third Abenaki War (1722–25), called [[Dummer's War]], erupted when the French [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Sébastien Rale]] (or Rasles, 1657?-1724) encouraged the Abenaki to halt the spread of [[New England Colonies|Yankee]] settlements. When the Massachusetts militia tried to seize Rasles, the Abenaki raided the settlements at [[Brunswick, Maine|Brunswick]], [[Arrowsic, Maine|Arrowsick]], and [[Merrymeeting Bay|Merry-Meeting Bay]]. The Massachusetts government then declared war, and bloody battles were fought at [[Norridgewock]] (1724), where Rasles was killed, and at [[Battle of Pequawket|a daylong battle]] at Pequawket, an Indian village near present-day [[Fryeburg, Maine]], on the upper [[Saco River]] (1725). Peace conferences at [[Boston]] and [[Casco Bay]] brought an end to the war. After Rale died, the Abenaki moved to a settlement on the St. Francis River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor=Spencer C. Tucker| title=The Encyclopedia of North American Indian Wars, 1607–1890: A Political, Social, and Military History| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JsM4A0GSO34C&amp;pg=PA249| year=2011| publisher=ABC-CLIO| page=249| isbn=9781851096978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abenaki from St. Francois continued to raid British settlements in their former homelands along the New England frontier during [[Father Le Loutre's War]] (see [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1750)]]) and the [[French and Indian War]].

====Maritime Abenaki====
Closer in language and culture to the Micmac, the Maliseet and Passamaquoddy have been listed as Abenaki for historical reasons. The French usually referred to both tribes as the Etchemin. Maliseet (Aroostook, Malecite, Malicite, St. John's Indians). From the Micmac word "malisit" meaning "broken talker." Their own name "Wulastegniak" means "good river people." Located along the St. John River in northeastern Maine and western New Brunswick. Devon, Kingsclear, Madawaska, Mary's, Medoctec (Medoktek, Meductic), Okpaak, Oromocto, St. Anne, St. Basile, The Brothers (Micmac), Tobique, Viger, and Woodstock.

Various forms of Sokoki are: Assokwekik, Ondeake, Onejagese, Sakukia, Sokokiois, Sokoquios, Sokoquis, Sokokquis, Sokoni, Sokwaki, Soquachjck, and Zooquagese. Some accounts include groups of the western Pennacook as Sokoki: Amoskeag, Naamkeek, Nashaway, Souheyan, and Winnipesaukee. Sokoki is often confused with the Saco, a name given to eastern Abenaki who lived near the Saco River (a combination of Pigwacket, Kennebec, and Androscoggin). Cowasuck (Cahass, Cohassiac, Coos, Coosuc, Koes). Hoosac was a mixed settlement with the Mahican. Missisquoi (Mazipskoik, Misiskuoi, Missiassik, Missique, Missisco) "place of flint."

The development of tourism projects has allowed the Canadian Abenaki to develop a modern economy, while preserving their culture and traditions. For example, since 1960, the Odanak Historical Society has managed the first and one of the largest aboriginal museums in Quebec, a few miles from the [[Quebec City|Quebec]]-[[Montreal]] axis. Over 5,000 people visit the Abenaki Museum annually. Several Abenaki companies include: in Wôlinak, General Fiberglass Engineering employs a dozen natives, with annual sales of more than $3 million Canadian dollars. Odanak is now active in transportation and distribution. Notable Abenaki from this area include the documentary filmmaker [[Alanis Obomsawin]] ([[National Film Board of Canada]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbodanak.com/anglais/page_/accueil_agl.htm |title=Administration |publisher=Cbodanak.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720010730/http://www.cbodanak.com/anglais/page_/accueil_agl.htm |archive-date=2012-07-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States federal tribal Recognition===
====The [[Penobscot|Penobscot Indian Nation]] and the [[Passamaquoddy]] Tribes==== 
These two tribes are officially listed [[list of federally recognized tribes|federally recognized]] as tribes in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bia.gov/WhoWeAre/BIA/OIS/TribalGovernmentServices/TribalDirectory/index.htm#m| title=Tribal Directory| publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs| accessdate=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Passamaquoddy]] Tribe of Maine was recognized by the federal courts as a tribe, but not having a land trust with the government&lt;ref&gt; [URL https://www.narf.org/nill/documents/nlr/nlr14-3.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt; since never entering into a formal treaty. This launched the very long legal battle that paved the way for many other tribes across America file file suits regarding assett mismanagement. After winning the landmark case, simuar cases were filed in 2006 by 60 tribes from throughout the United States. Among the Passamaquoddy’s assets was $13.5 million in federal funds that were allocated to the tribe in 1980 through the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act, which was settled for $81.5 million. &lt;ref&gt; [URL https://bangordailynews.com/2012/04/02/news/down-east/passamaquoddy-tribe-awarded-11-4-million-in-asset-mismanagement-dispute/] &lt;/ref&gt;

====State of Vermont====
In 2006, the state of [[Vermont]] officially recognized the Abenaki as a People, but not a Tribe. The state noted that many Abenaki had been assimilated, only small remnants remained on reservations during and after the [[French and Indian War]], and later [[eugenics]] projects further decimated the Abenaki people of America through forced [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] and questionable "[[miscarriage]]s" at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uvm.edu/~lkaelber/eugenics/VT/VT.html| title=Vermont: Eugenics: Compulsory Sterilization in 50 American States| publisher=University of Vermont| accessdate=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted above, facing annihilation, many Abenaki had begun emigrating to Canada, then under French control, around 1669.

The [[Missiquoi|Sokoki-St. Francis Band]] of the Abenaki Nation organized a tribal council in 1976 at [[Swanton (town), Vermont|Swanton, Vermont]]. Vermont granted recognition of the council the same year, but later withdrew it. In 1982, the band applied for federal recognition, which is still pending. Four Abenaki communities are located in Vermont. On April 22, 2011, Vermont officially recognized two Abenaki bands: the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki and the El Nu Abenaki Tribe. On May 7, 2012, the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi and the Koasek of the Koas Abenaki Traditional Band received recognition by the State of Vermont.
&lt;!---this repeats information given above. Need to consolidate somewhere and not repeat it---&gt;
The Abenaki who chose to remain in the United States did not fare as well as their Canadian counterparts. Tribal connections were lost as those Abenaki who were tolerated by the Anglo population were assimilated into colonial society. What familial groups remained were often eradicated, in the early 20th century, through forced sterilization and [[pregnancy termination]] policies in Vermont. There were over 3,400 reported cases of sterilization of Abenaki having been performed, many of which involved termination of an unborn fetus. No documentation of informed consent for these procedures was found. After this period the only Abenaki that remained in the United States were those who could pass for white, or avoid capture and subsequent dissolution of their families through forced interment in "schools" after their sterilization.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} At the time, many of the children who were sterilized were not even aware of what the physicians had done to them. This was performed under the auspices of the Brandon School of the Feeble-Minded, and the Vermont Reform School. It was documented in the 1911 "Preliminary Report of the Committee of the Eugenic Section of the American Breeder's Association to Study and to Report on the Best Practical Means for Cutting Off the Defective Germ-Plasm in the Human Population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~lkaelber/eugenics/VT/VT.html |title=Vermont Eugenics |publisher=Uvm.edu |date=1931-03-31 |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Henrik Palmgren |url=http://www.redicecreations.com/article.php?id=609 |title=The Horrifying American Roots of Nazi Eugenics |publisher=Redicecreations.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vermont]] Elnu ([[Jamaica, Vermont|Jamaica]]) and Nulhegan ([[Brownington, Vermont|Brownington]]) bands' application for official recognition was recommended and referred to the [[Vermont General Assembly]] by the [http://vcnaa.vermont.gov Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs] on January 19, 2011, as a result of a process established by the Vermont legislature in 2010.  Recognition allows applicants to seek scholarship funds reserved for American Indians and to receive federal "native made" designation for the bands' arts and crafts.&lt;ref name="Abenaki Turn to Vermont Legislature for Recognition"&gt;Hallenbeck, Terri. [http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20110120/NEWS02/110119025/Abenaki-turn-to-Vermont-Legislature-for-recognition Abenaki Turn to Vermont Legislature for Recognition ''Burlington Free Press'']{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} January 20, 2011.  Retrieved January 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2011, Vermont officially recognized two Abenaki bands: the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki and the El Nu Abenaki Tribe. On May 7, 2012, the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi and the Koasek Traditional Band of the Koas Abenaki Nation received recognition by the State of Vermont.

====New Hampshire and minority recognition====
In New Hampshire the Abenaki, along with other Native American groups, have proposed legislation for recognition as a minority group. This bill was debated in 2010 in the [[New Hampshire General Court|state legislature]]. The bill would have created a state commission on Native American relations, which would act as an advisory group to the [[governor of New Hampshire|governor]] and the state government in general.&lt;ref name="HB 1610"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2010/HB1610.html| title=HB 1610-FN – As Amended by the House| publisher=NH General Court| accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abenaki want to gain formal state recognition as a people.

Opponents of the bill feared it could lead to Abenaki land claims for property now owned and occupied by European Americans. Others worried that the Abenaki may use recognition as a step toward opening a casino. But, the bill specifically says that "this act shall not be interpreted to provide any Native American or Abenaki person with any other special rights or privileges that the state does not confer on or grant to other state residents." New Hampshire has considered expanding gambling separate from the Native Americans.&lt;ref name="Gambling"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wmur.com/money/22744578/detail.html| title=Gambling Bill Would Create 6 Casinos, Allow Black Jack| publisher=WMUR.com| date=March 4, 2010| accessdate=March 22, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The council would be under the Department of Cultural Resources,&lt;ref name="HB 1610"/&gt; so it would be in the same department as the State Council on the Arts. The bill would allow for the creation and sale of goods to be labeled as Native-made, to create a source of income for the Natives in New Hampshire.

The numerous groups of Natives in the state have created a New Hampshire Inter-tribal Council, which holds statewide meetings and [[powwow]]s. Dedicated to preserving the culture of the Natives in New Hampshire, the group is one of the chief supporters of the HB 1610; the Abenaki, the main tribe in the state, are the only people named specifically in the bill.&lt;ref name="NHITC"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nhitnac.tripod.com/index2.html| title=The New Hampshire Inter-Tribal Native American Council: Mission Statement| accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout time, Abenaki language has been made to thought it was unimportant and with the fading of generations, the [[Abenaki]] language became more and more scarce. Abenaki language was as low as twelve native speakers as of 2015, but with recent focus and extra efforts in the Abenaki community, this number seems to be growing. Today, there are some passionate Abenaki, and non Abenaki people, like Jeanne Brink`&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindholm|first1=Jane|title=Preserving Abenaki Language Culture|url=http://www.vpr.net/episode/42878/preserving-abenaki-language-culture|website=VPR|publisher=Vermont Public Radio|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Vermont,  who are trying to revitalize the Abenaki culture, which includes their language and their basket making traditions. Today, there are about 12,000 people of varying Abenaki heritage in the Canadian and New England regions, all varying in their connection to their language.  In [[Maine]],  there are about 3,000 [[Penobscot]] Native Americans, and this is a large driving force of the language resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abnaki-Penobscot (Abenaki Language)|url=http://www.native-languages.org/abna.htm|website=Native Languages of the Americas|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Brink and others, [[Jesse Bruchac]] is a loud voice in the Abenaki culture.  Along with writing and publishing various Abenaki books, he created a movie and sound piece telling the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] side of Thanksgiving while spoken in Abenaki.  In this film, called [[Saints &amp; Strangers]], the three actors not only memorized the lines in Abenaki, but also learned the syntax behind the language and learnt from filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Scott|title=Telling Thanksgiving's Story in a Vanishing American Language|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151117-thanksgiving-native-americans-indians-language-saints-strangers/|website=ews.nationalgeographic.com|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This revitalization of the famous Thanksgiving story from a new tongue and perspective offered a more original and full version of what Thanksgiving might have really been like so many years ago.

In Bruchac's novel, ''L8dwaw8gan Wji Abaznodakaw8gan: The Language of Basket Making '' Bruchac notes that Abenaki is a poly-synthetic language, which makes the ways to express oneself in Abenaki is almost limitless. Abenaki language consists of dependent and independent grammar, which address the gender of the speaker.  Abenaki also uses nouns, pronouns, first, second, third, and indefinite parts of speech, and verbs, and adjectives.  If the noun is animate or inanimate alters the structure of the sentence or phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruchac|first1=Jesse|last2=Brink|first2=Jeanne|last3=Joubert|first3=Joseph|title=L8dwaw8gan Wji Abaznodakaw8gan: The Language of Basket Making|date=January 31, 2011|publisher=lulu.com|isbn=978-0557632107|pages=1–4, 34–39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SM8dAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=abenaki+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2up6t7bDTAhVFySYKHSxYBmwQ6AEIVDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=abenaki%20language&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although written primarily in English, ''Aln8bak News'' helped to preserve the Abenaki language through the inclusion of Abenaki words and their translations throughout each newsletter. ''Aln8bak News'' was a quarterly newsletter that discussed cultural, historical, and contemporary information regarding the Cowasuck Band of the Pennacook Abenaki. It was started in 1993, by Paul Pouilot, Sagamo of the Cowasuck Band of the Pennacook Abenaki.&lt;ref name="Dawnland Voices"&gt;{{cite web|title=Digitizing Tribal Newsletters|url=http://dawnlandvoices.org/digitizing-tribal-newsletters/|website=Dawnland Voices 2.0|publisher=Dawn Land Voices|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word, Aln8bak (pronounced like Alnôbak) is often used as a synonym to [[Abenaki]]. Initially the newsletter was called ''Aln8ba8dwa National News'' (Aln8ba8dwa or Alnôbaôdwa means "Abenaki speaking").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aln8bak News Vol 2003 Issue 1 January February March 2003|url=http://www.cowasuck.org/aln8bak/2003/issue1/v03n1p1.htm|website=Cowasuck Band of the Pennacook Abenaki People|publisher=COWASS North America|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues of the quarterly newsletter from 2003-2010 were published by the Cowasuck Band of the Pennacook Abenaki on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnic and Alternative Newspaper Collections - Online: Native North Americans|url=http://libguides.uky.edu/c.php?g=223220&amp;p=1477925|website=University of Kentucky Libraries|publisher=University of Kentucky|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a statement made by the Band, after 2010, they stopped publishing the newsletter on their website due a lack of financial support from online readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aln8bak Quarterly News Special Announcement|url=http://www.cowasuck.org/newsannounce.htm|website=Cowasuck Band of the Pennacook Abenaki People|publisher=COWASS North America|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Aln8bak News'' included community-related information such as updates on governance issues, notices of social events, and obituaries. The newsletter also included Band history, genealogy, language lessons, recipes, plant and animal studies, books reviews, and writings by Band members.&lt;ref name="Dawnland Voices"/&gt;

The English word "[[skunk]]", attested in [[New England]] in the 1630s, is probably borrowed from the Abenaki ''seganku''.&lt;ref&gt;''A concise etymological dictionary of the English language'', Walter William Skeat, Harper &amp; Brothers, 1882, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZkRAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=skeat's+etymological+dictionary+skunk&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s p. 440]&lt;/ref&gt; About 500 Penobscot words are "still being used in the community in everyday language," such as "Muhmum" for "grandpa", and "nolke" for "deer".&lt;ref name ="bangordailynewsjuly2013"/&gt;

The 2015 [[National Geographic Channel]] mini-series ''[[Saints &amp; Strangers]]'', telling the story surrounding the foundation of [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth Plantation]] and the celebration of the "First Thanksgiving", contained a considerable amount of dialogue in the Western Abenaki language. Several actors, including [[Tatanka Means]] ([[Hobbamock]]), and [[Raoul Trujillo]] ([[Massasoit]]) spoke the language exclusively throughout the series, and Kalani Qweypo ([[Squanto]]) spoke both Abenaki and English. Western Abenaki language teacher [[Jesse Bruchac]] of Ndakinna Education Center was hired as a language consultant on the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/saints-and-strangers/videos/speaking-the-language/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morphosyntax ==
Linguists studying the Abenaki have called the language a language of verbs due to its high degree of inflectional complexity. Although the language does not use gender, nouns are divided into two categories: noble and ignoble. Although there may be occasional exceptions, noble words pertain to living things, while inanimate objects are considered to be ignoble words.&lt;ref&gt;Heald, B. (2014). A History of the New Hampshire Abenaki. Charleston, South Carolina: The History Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numerals==
''bazegw'' = one&lt;br&gt;
''niz'' = two&lt;br&gt;
''nas'' = three&lt;br&gt;
''yaw'' = four&lt;br&gt;
''n[ô]lan'' * = five&lt;br&gt;

''tôbawôz'' = seven&lt;br&gt;
''nsôzek'' = eight&lt;br&gt;
''noliwi'' = nine&lt;br&gt;

'''Broadcast television systems''' are encoding or formatting standards for the transmission and reception of [[terrestrial television]] signals. There were three main [[analog television]] systems in use around the world until the late 2010s (expected): [[NTSC]], [[PAL]], and [[SECAM]]. Now in [[digital television]] (DTV), there are four main systems in use around the world: [[ATSC]], [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]], [[ISDB]] and [[DTMB]].

==Analog television systems==
[[Image:PAL-NTSC-SECAM.svg|thumb|upright=1.5| Analog colour television encoding systems by nation]]
All but one analog television system began as [[black-and-white]] systems. Each country, faced with local political, technical, and economic issues, adopted a [[color television]] system which was grafted onto an existing [[monochrome]] system, using gaps in the video spectrum (explained below) to allow color transmission information to fit in the existing channels allotted. The grafting of the color transmission standards onto existing monochrome systems permitted existing monochrome television receivers predating the changeover to color television to continue to be operated as monochrome television. Because of this compatibility requirement, color standards added a second signal to the basic monochrome signal, which carries the color information. The color information is called [[chrominance]] with the symbol C, while the black and white information is called the [[Luminance (video)|luminance]] with the symbol Y. Monochrome television receivers only display the luminance, while color receivers process both signals. Though in theory any monochrome system could be adopted to a color system, in practice some of the original monochrome systems proved impractical to adapt to color and were abandoned when the switch to color broadcasting was made. All countries used one of three color systems: NTSC, PAL, or SECAM.

===Frames===
{{Main article|Film frame}}.

Ignoring color, all television systems work in essentially the same manner. The monochrome image seen by a camera (later, the [[Luminance (video)|luminance]] component of a color image) is divided into horizontal ''scan lines'', some number of which make up a single image or ''frame''. A monochrome image is theoretically continuous, and thus unlimited in horizontal resolution, but to make television practical, a limit had to be placed on the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the television signal, which puts an ultimate limit on the horizontal resolution possible. When color was introduced, this necessity of limit became fixed. All analog television systems are ''[[interlaced]]'': alternate rows of the frame are transmitted in sequence, followed by the remaining rows in their sequence. Each half of the frame is called a ''[[video field]]'', and the rate at which field are transmitted is one of the fundamental parameters of a video system. It is related to the [[utility frequency]] at which the [[electricity distribution]] system operates, to avoid flicker resulting from the [[Beat (acoustics)|beat]] between the television screen deflection system and nearby mains generated magnetic fields. All digital, or "fixed pixel," displays have [[progressive scan]]ning and must [[deinterlace]] an interlaced source. Use of inexpensive deinterlacing hardware is a typical difference between lower- vs. higher-priced [[flat panel display]]s ([[Plasma display]], [[LCD]], etc.).

All [[film]]s and other filmed material shot at 24 frames per second must be transferred to video [[frame rate]]s using a [[telecine]] in order to prevent severe motion jitter effects. Typically, for 25 frame/s formats (European among other countries with 50&amp;nbsp;Hz mains supply), the content is [[PAL speedup]], while a technique known as "[[3:2 pulldown]]" is used for 30 frame/s formats (North America among other countries with 60&amp;nbsp;Hz mains supply) to match the film frame rate to the video frame rate without speeding up the play back.

===Viewing technology===
Analog television signal standards are designed to be displayed on a [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT), and so the physics of these devices necessarily controls the format of the video signal. The image on a CRT is painted by a moving beam of electrons which hits a [[phosphor]] coating on the front of the tube. This electron beam is steered by a magnetic field generated by powerful [[electromagnet]]s close to the source of the electron beam.

In order to reorient this magnetic steering mechanism, a certain amount of time is required due to the [[inductance]] of the magnets; the greater the change, the greater the time it takes for the electron beam to settle in the new spot.

For this reason, it is necessary to shut off the electron beam (corresponding to a video signal of [[zero luminance]]) during the time it takes to reorient the beam from the end of one line to the beginning of the next (''horizontal retrace'') and from the bottom of the screen to the top (''vertical retrace'' or ''[[vertical blanking interval]]''). The horizontal retrace is accounted for in the time allotted to each scan line, but the vertical retrace is accounted for as ''phantom lines'' which are never displayed but which are included in the number of lines per frame defined for each video system. Since the electron beam must be turned off in any case, the result is gaps in the television signal, which can be used to transmit other information, such as test signals or color identification signals.

The temporal gaps translate into a comb-like [[frequency spectrum]] for the signal, where the teeth are spaced at line frequency and concentrate most of the energy; the space between the teeth can be used to insert a color subcarrier.

===Hidden signaling===
Broadcasters later developed mechanisms to transmit digital information on the phantom lines, used mostly for [[teletext]] and [[closed captioning]]:
* [[PALplus]] uses a [[Widescreen signaling|hidden signaling]] scheme to indicate if it exists, and if so what operational mode it is in.
* [[NTSC]] has been modified by the [[ATSC|Advanced Television Systems Committee]] to support an [[ghost-canceling reference|anti-ghosting signal]] that is inserted on a non-visible scan line.
* [[Teletext]] uses hidden signaling to transmit information pages.
* [[NTSC]] [[Closed Captioning]] signaling uses signaling that is nearly identical to [[teletext]] signaling.
* [[Widescreen]] All 625 line systems incorporate pulses on line 23 that flag to the display that a 16:9 widescreen image is being broadcast, though this option was not used on later analog transmissions.

===Overscan===
{{Main article|Overscan}}

Television images are unique in that they must incorporate regions of the picture with reasonable-quality content, that will never be seen by some viewers.{{vague|date=September 2017}}

===Interlacing===
{{Main article|Interlaced video}}

In a purely analog system, field order is merely a matter of convention. For digitally recorded material it becomes necessary to rearrange the field order when conversion takes place from one standard to another.

===Image polarity===
Another parameter of analog television systems, minor by comparison, is the choice of whether vision modulation is positive or negative. Some of the earliest electronic television systems such as the British 405-line (system A) used positive modulation. It was also used in the two Belgian systems (system C, 625 lines, and System F, 819 lines) and the two French systems (system E, 819 lines, and system L, 625 lines). In positive modulation systems, as in the earlier [[white facsimile transmission]] standard, the maximum luminance value is represented by the maximum carrier power; in negative [[modulation]], the maximum luminance value is represented by zero carrier power. All newer analog video systems use negative modulation with the exception of the French System L.

Impulsive noise, especially from older automotive ignition systems, caused white spots to appear on the screens of television receivers using positive modulation but they could use simple synchronization circuits. Impulsive noise in negative modulation systems appears as dark spots that are less visible, but picture synchronization was seriously degraded when using simple synchronization. The synchronization problem was overcome with the invention of [[phase-locked synchronization circuit]]s. When these first appeared in Britain in the early 1950s one name used to describe them was "flywheel synchronisation."

Older televisions for positive modulation systems were sometimes equipped with a peak video signal inverter that would turn the white interference spots dark. This was usually user-adjustable with a control on the rear of the television labeled "White Spot Limiter" in Britain or "Antiparasite" in France. If adjusted incorrectly it would turn bright white picture content dark. Most of the positive modulation television systems ceased operation by the mid-1980s. The French System L continued on up to the transition to digital broadcasting. Positive modulation was one of several unique technical features that originally protected the French electronics and broadcasting industry from foreign competition and rendered French TV sets incapable of receiving broadcasts from neighboring countries.

Another advantage of negative modulation is that, since the synchronizing pulses represent maximum carrier power, it is relatively easy to arrange the receiver [[automatic gain control]] to only operate during sync pulses and thus get a constant amplitude video signal to drive the rest of the TV set. This was not possible for many years with positive modulation as the peak carrier power varied depending on picture content. Modern digital processing circuits have achieved a similar effect but using the front porch of the video signal.

===Modulation===
Given all of these parameters, the result is a mostly-continuous [[analog signal]] which can be modulated onto a radio-frequency carrier and transmitted through an antenna. All analog television systems use [[vestigial sideband modulation]], a form of [[amplitude modulation]] in which one sideband is partially removed. This reduces the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, enabling narrower channels to be used.

===Audio===
In analog television, the [[analog audio]] portion of a broadcast is invariably modulated separately from the video. Most commonly, the audio and video are combined at the transmitter before being presented to the antenna, but separate aural and visual antennas can be used. In all cases where negative video is used, [[frequency modulation|FM]] is used for the standard [[monaural]] audio; systems with positive video use AM sound and intercarrier receiver technology cannot be incorporated. Stereo, or more generally multi-channel, audio is encoded using a number of schemes which (except in the French systems) are independent of the video system. The principal systems are [[NICAM]], which uses a digital audio encoding; double-FM (known under a variety of names, notably [[Zweikanalton]], A2 Stereo, West German Stereo, German Stereo or IGR Stereo), in which case each audio channel is separately modulated in FM and added to the broadcast signal; and [[BTSC]] (also known as [[Multichannel television sound|MTS]]), which multiplexes additional audio channels into the FM audio carrier. All three systems are compatible with monaural FM audio, but only [[NICAM]] may be used with the French AM audio systems.

===Evolution===
For historical reasons, some countries use a different video system on [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] than they do on the [[VHF]] bands. In a few countries, most notably the [[United Kingdom]], television broadcasting on VHF has been entirely shut down. Note that the British [[405-line]] system A, unlike all the other systems, suppressed the upper sideband rather than the lower—befitting its status as the oldest operating television system to survive into the color era (although was never officially broadcast with color encoding). System A was tested with all three color systems, and production equipment was designed and ready to be built; System A might have survived, as NTSC-A, had the British government not decided to harmonize with the rest of Europe on a 625-line video standard, implemented in Britain as PAL-I on UHF only.

The French [[819 line]] system E was a post-war effort to advance [[France]]'s standing in television technology. Its 819-lines were almost high definition even by today's standards. Like the British system A, it was VHF only and remained black &amp; white until its shutdown in 1984 in France and 1985 in Monaco. It was tested with SECAM in the early stages, but later the decision was made to adopt color in 625-lines. Thus France adopted system L on UHF only and abandoned system E.

In many parts of the world, analog television broadcasting has been shut down completely, or in process of shutdown; see [[Digital television transition]] for a timeline of the analog shutdown.

==List of analog television systems==

===Pre–World War II systems===
{{Main article|Television systems before 1940}}

A number of experimental and broadcast pre WW2 systems were tested. The first ones were mechanically based and of very low resolution, sometimes with no sound. Later TV systems were electronic.
* The UK 405 line system was the first to have an allocated '''ITU System Letter Designation'''.

===ITU standards===
On an international conference in [[Stockholm]] in 1961, the [[International Telecommunication Union]] designated standards for broadcast television systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-r/opb/act/R-ACT-RRC.1-1961-PDF-E.pdf Final acts of the European Broadcasting Conference in the VHF and UHF bands. Stockholm, 1961.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Each standard is designated a letter (A-M); in combination with a color system (NTSC, PAL, SECAM), this completely specifies all of the monaural analog television systems in the world (for example, PAL-B, NTSC-M, etc.).

The following table gives the principal characteristics of each standard. Defunct TV systems are shown in grey text, previous ones never designated by ITU are not yet shown. Except for [[display resolution|lines]] and [[frame rate]]s, other units are [[megahertz]] (MHz).

==Digital television systems==
The situation with worldwide digital television is much simpler by comparison. Most digital television systems are based on the [[MPEG transport stream]] standard, and use the [[H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2]] video [[codec]]. They differ significantly in the details of how the transport stream is converted into a broadcast signal, in the video format prior to encoding (or alternatively, after decoding), and in the audio format. This has not prevented the creation of an international standard that includes both major systems, even though they are incompatible in almost every respect.

The two principal digital broadcasting systems are [[ATSC standards]], developed by the [[Advanced Television Systems Committee]] and adopted as a standard in most of [[North America]], and [[DVB-T]], the '''D'''igital '''V'''ideo '''B'''roadcast – '''T'''errestrial system used in most of the rest of the world. [[DVB-T]] was designed for format compatibility with existing [[direct broadcast satellite]] services in Europe (which use the [[DVB-S]] standard, and also sees some use in [[direct-to-home]] satellite dish providers in [[North America]]), and there is also a [[DVB-C]] version for cable television. While the ATSC standard also includes support for satellite and cable television systems, operators of those systems have chosen other technologies (principally DVB-S or proprietary systems for satellite and [[256QAM]] replacing VSB for cable). Japan uses a third system, closely related to DVB-T, called [[ISDB-T]], which is compatible with [[Brazil]]'s [[SBTVD]]. The [[People's Republic of China]] has developed a fourth system, named [[DMB-T/H]].

[[Image:Digital broadcast standards.svg|thumb|600px|center|DTT broadcasting systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvb.org/about_dvb/dvb_worldwide/index.xml DVB.org], Official information taken from the DVB website&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===ATSC===
{{main article|ATSC system}}

The terrestrial ATSC system (unofficially ATSC-T) uses a proprietary [[Zenith Electronics Corporation|Zenith]]-developed modulation called [[8-VSB]]; as the name implies, it is a vestigial sideband technique. Essentially, analog VSB is to regular amplitude modulation as 8VSB is to eight-way [[quadrature amplitude modulation]]. This system was chosen specifically to provide for maximum spectral compatibility between existing analog TV and new digital stations in the United States' already-crowded television allocations system, although it is inferior to the other digital systems in dealing with [[multipath interference]]; however, it is better at dealing with [[Electromagnetic interference|impulse noise]] which is especially present on the VHF bands that other countries have discontinued from TV use, but are still used in the U.S. There is also no [[hierarchical modulation]]. After demodulation and error-correction, the 8-VSB modulation supports a digital data stream of about 19.39 Mbit/s, enough for one high-definition video stream or several standard-definition services. See [[Digital subchannel#Technical considerations|Digital subchannel: Technical considerations]] for more information.

On November 17, 2017, the FCC voted 3-2 in favor of authorizing voluntary deployments of [[ATSC 3.0]], which was designed as the successor to the original ATSC "1.0", and issued a Report and Order to that effect. Full-power stations will be required to maintain a simulcast of their channels on an ATSC 1.0-compatible signal if they decide to deploy an ATSC 3.0 service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-authorizes-next-gen-tv-broadcast-standard|title=FCC Authorizes Next Gen TV Broadcast Standard|website=Federal Communications Commission|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On cable, ATSC usually uses [[256QAM]], although some use [[16VSB]]. Both of these double the [[throughput]] to 38.78 Mbit/s within the same 6&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. ATSC is also used over satellite. While these are logically called ATSC-C and ATSC-S, these terms were never officially defined.

===DTMB===
{{main article|DTMB}}

DTMB is the digital television broadcasting standard of the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. This is a fusion system, which is a compromise of different competing proposing standards from different Chinese Universities, which incorporates elements from [[DMB-T]], [[ADTB-T]] and [[TiMi 3]].

===DVB===
{{main article|Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB-T|DVB-S|DVB-C}}

'''DVB-T''' uses [[coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing]] (COFDM), which uses as many as 8000 independent carriers, each transmitting data at a comparatively low rate. This system was designed to provide superior immunity from [[multipath interference]], and has a choice of system variants which allow data rates from 4&amp;nbsp;MBit/s up to 24&amp;nbsp;MBit/s. One US broadcaster, [[Sinclair Broadcasting]], petitioned the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to permit the use of COFDM instead of 8-VSB, on the theory that this would improve prospects for digital TV reception by households without outside antennas (a majority in the US), but this request was denied. (However, one US digital station, WNYE-DT in [[New York City|New York]], was temporarily converted to COFDM modulation on an emergency basis for [[datacasting]] information to emergency services personnel in lower [[Manhattan]] in the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]]).

'''DVB-S''' is the original [[Digital Video Broadcasting]] forward error coding and modulation standard for [[satellite television]] and dates back to 1995. It is used via satellites serving every continent of the world, including [[North America]]. DVB-S is used in both [[MCPC]] and [[SCPC]] modes for [[broadcast network]] [[feed (telecom)|feeds]], as well as for [[direct broadcast satellite]] services like [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] and [[Freesat]] in the British Isles, [[Sky Deutschland]] and [[HD+]] in Germany and Austria, TNT SAT/FRANSAT and [[CanalSat]] in France, [[Dish Network]] in the US, and [[Bell TV]] in Canada. The [[MPEG transport stream]] delivered by DVB-S is mandated as MPEG-2.

'''DVB-C''' stands for '''Digital Video Broadcasting - Cable''' and it is the DVB European consortium standard for the broadcast transmission of [[digital television]] over [[coaxial cable|cable]]. This system transmits an [[MPEG-2]] family digital audio/video stream, using a [[QAM]] modulation with [[Channel code|channel coding]].

===ISDB===
ISDB is very similar to DVB, however it is broken into 13 subchannels. Twelve are used for TV, while the last serves either as a [[guard band]], or for the [[1seg]] (ISDB-H) service. Like the other DTV systems, the ISDB types differ mainly in the modulations used, due to the requirements of different frequency bands. The 12&amp;nbsp;GHz band ISDB-S uses PSK modulation, 2.6&amp;nbsp;GHz band digital sound broadcasting uses CDM and ISDB-T (in VHF and/or UHF band) uses COFDM with PSK/QAM. It was developed in Japan with MPEG-2, and is now used in Brazil with MPEG-4. Unlike other digital broadcast systems, ISDB includes [[digital rights management]] to restrict recording of programming.

==Line count==
As interlaced systems require accurate positioning of scanning lines, it is important to make sure that the horizontal and vertical timebase are in a precise ratio. This is accomplished by passing the one through a series of electronic divider circuits to produce the other. Each division is by a [[prime number]].

Therefore, there has to be a straightforward mathematical relationship between the line and field frequencies, the latter being derived by dividing down from the former. Technology constraints of the 1930s meant that this division process could only be done using small integers, preferably no greater than 7, for good stability. The number of lines was odd because of 2:1 interlace. The 405 line system used a vertical frequency of 50 [[Hertz|Hz]] (Standard AC mains supply frequency in Britain) and a horizontal one of 10,125&amp;nbsp;Hz (&lt;span title="frame rate"&gt;50 × &lt;span title="lines"&gt;405&lt;/span&gt; ÷ &lt;span title="interlace"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;)

;Notes

# The division of the 240-line system is academic as the scan ratio was determined entirely by the construction of the mechanical scanning system used with the cameras used with this transmission system.
# The division ratio though relevant to [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]-based systems is largely academic today because modern [[LCD]] and [[plasma display]]s are not constrained to having the scanning in precise ratios. The 1080p high definition system requires 1126-lines in a CRT display.
# The System I version of the 625 line standard originally used 582 active lines before later changing to 576 in line with other 625 line systems.

==Conversion from one system to another system==
{{main article|Television standards conversion}}

Converting between different numbers of lines and different frequencies of fields/frames in video pictures is not an easy task. Perhaps the most technically challenging conversion to make is from any of the 625-line, 25-frame/s systems to system M, which has 525-lines at 29.97 frames per second. Historically this required a frame store to hold those parts of the picture not actually being output (since the scanning of any point was not time coincident). In more recent times, conversion of standards is a relatively easy task for a computer.

Aside from the line count being different, it's easy to see that generating 59.94 fields every second from a format that has only 50 fields might pose some interesting problems. Every second, an additional 10 fields must be generated seemingly from nothing. The conversion has to create new frames (from the existing input) in real time.

There are several methods used to do this, depending on the desired cost and conversion quality. The simplest possible converters simply drop every 5th line from every frame (when converting from 625 to 525) or duplicate every 4th line (when converting from 525 to 625), and then duplicate or drop some of those frames to make up the difference in frame rate. More complex systems include inter-field interpolation, adaptive interpolation, and phase correlation.

'''Censorship (psychoanalysis)''' (''Censur'') is the force identified by [[Sigmund Freud]] as operating to separate consciousness from the unconscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neville Symington]], ''Narcissism'' (London 2003) p. x&lt;/ref&gt;

==In dreaming== 
In ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'', Freud identified a force working to disguise the dream-thoughts so as to make them more acceptable to the dreamer.  In his wartime lectures, he compared its operation to the contemporary newspapers, where blanks would reveal first-hand the work of the censor, but where allusions, circumlocutions, and other softening techniques also showed attempts to work round the censorship of thoughts in advance.&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 170-1&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to characterise the motivating force, which he called "the self-observing agency as the ego-censor [''censor''], the conscience; it is this that exercises the dream-censorship [''censur''] during the night, from which the [[Repression (psychology)|repressions]] of inadmissable wishful impulses proceed".&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 479&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tool used by the dream-censorship was [[Regression (psychology)|regression]] to archaic symbolic forms of expression unfamiliar to the conscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  Where all such measures of censorship failed, however, the result could be the development of nightmares and [[insomnia]].&lt;ref&gt;E Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin 1976) p. 144-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytic extensions==
Freud found the same effects of disguise and omission taking place in the construction of neurotic symptoms, under the influence of the censorship, as in dreams.&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; He would eventually assign the role of censor to the mental agency he would term the [[Id, ego and super-ego|superego]].&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Sartre]] questioned how the censorship could operate unless it was already aware of the contents of the unconscious, and thought the phenomena Freud described could be better understood in terms of [[Bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]].&lt;ref&gt;J Webber, ''The Existentialism of Jean-Paul Sartre'' (2007) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Central Asian Arabic''' is a [[Varieties of Arabic|variety]] of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] spoken in [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]], and currently facing extinction. It was once spoken among [[Central Asia]]'s numerous settled and nomadic [[Arab]] communities, which inhabited areas in [[Samarqand Province|Samarqand]], [[Bukhara Province|Bukhara]], [[Qashqadaryo Province|Qashqadarya]], [[Surxondaryo Province|Surkhandarya]] (present-day Uzbekistan), and [[Khatlon]] (present-day Tajikistan), as well as [[Afghanistan]]. The first wave of Arabs migrated to this region in the 8th century during the [[Muslim conquests]] and was later joined by groups of Arabs from [[Balkh]] and [[Andkhoy]] (present-day Afghanistan). Owing to heavy [[Islam]]ic influences, Arabic quickly became the common language of science and literature of the epoch. Most Central Asian Arabs lived in isolated communities and did not favour intermarriages with the local population. This factor helped their language survive in a multilingual milieu until the 20th century. By the 1880s many Arab pastoralists had migrated to northern Afghanistan from what is now Uzbekistan and Tajikistan following the [[Russia]]n conquest of Central Asia. These Arabs nowadays speak no Arabic having adapted to [[Dari (Afghanistan)|Dari]] and Uzbek.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/afghanistan/44.htm Peter R. Blood, ed. Afghanistan: A Country Study]. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the establishment of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, Arab communities faced major linguistic and identity changes having had to abandon nomadic lifestyles and gradually mixing with [[Uzbek people|Uzbeks]], [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] and [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]]. According to the [[Soviet Census (1959)|1959 census]], only 34% of Soviet Arabs, mostly elderly, spoke their language at a native level. Others reported [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] or [[Tajik language|Tajik]] as their mother tongue. 

Nowadays Central Asian Arabic (heavily influenced by the local languages in phonetics, vocabulary and syntax) is spoken in 5 villages of [[Surxondaryo Region|Surkhandarya]], [[Qashqadaryo Region|Qashqadarya]] and [[Bukhara Region|Bukhara]]. In Uzbekistan, there are at least two dialects of Central Asian Arabic: Bukharian (influenced by Tajik) and Qashqadaryavi (influenced by [[Turkic languages]]). These dialects are not [[mutually intelligible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://diaspora.ferghana.ru/atlas/Ethnic%20minorities.pdf Ethnic Minorities of Uzbekistan: Arabs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205225625/http://diaspora.ferghana.ru/atlas/Ethnic%20minorities.pdf |date=February 5, 2007 }} by Olga Kobzeva&lt;/ref&gt; In Tajikistan, Central Asian Arabic is spoken by 35.7% of the country's Arab population, having been largely replaced by Tajik.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.minority.tj/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=23&amp;Itemid=39 Ethnic Minorities of Tajikistan: Arabs]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giorgi Tsereteli]] and [[Isaak Natanovich Vinnikov]] [[w:ru:Винников, Исаак Натанович]] were responsible for the first academic studies of Central Asian Arabic.

Recent studies considered [[Khorasani Arabic]] (spoken in [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]], [[Iran]]) as part of the Central Asian Arabic family, and found that it was closely related to Qashqadaryavi.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Seeger, ''[https://www.academia.edu/10319772/On_the_Relationship_of_the_Central_Asian_Arabic_Dialects On the Relationship of the Central Asian Arabic Dialects]'' (translated from German to English by Sarah Dickins)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chuwabo''' (''Echuwabo''), also spelled ''Cuabo'' and ''Txuwabo'', is a [[Bantu language]] spoken along the central coast of [[Mozambique]].

Maindo, though customarily considered a separate language, is close enough to be a dialect of Chuwabo.

[[File:Fotothek_df_tg_0005486_Mathematik_%5E_Kombinatorik.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Frontispiece of the book printed in 1690]]
The '''''Dissertatio de arte combinatoria''''' ("Dissertation on the Art of Combinations" or "On the Combinatorial Art") is an early work by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]] published in 1666 in [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Leibniz, ''Dissertatio de arte combinatoria'', 1666, ''Sämtliche Schriften und Briefe'' (Berlin: ''Akademie Verlag'', 1923), A VI 1, p. 163; ''Philosophische Schriften'' (Gerhardt) Bd. IV p. 30;&lt;/ref&gt; It is an extended version of his first [[doctoral dissertation]],&lt;ref&gt;The first part of the book was his [[habilitation]] [[thesis]] in Philosophy at [[Leipzig University]]. Leibniz defended his thesis in March 1666 (see Richard T. W. Arthur, ''Leibniz'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2014, p. x).&lt;/ref&gt; written before the author had seriously undertaken the study of mathematics.&lt;ref name="Philosophie page 32"&gt;[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. ''Hauptschriften zur Grundlegung der Philosophie. Zur allgemeinen Charakteristik.'' ''Philosophische Werke'' Band 1. p. 32. Translated in German by Artur Buchenau. Published, reviewed and added an introduction and notes by Ernst Cassirer. Hamburg: Felix Meiner, 1966, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The booklet was reissued without Leibniz' consent in 1690, which prompted him to publish a brief explanatory notice in the ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;G.G.L.&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; ''Ars Combinatoria'', ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]'', Feb. 1691, pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; During the following years he repeatedly expressed regrets about its being circulated as he considered it immature.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz complained to various correspondents, e.g., to Morell (1 October 1697) or to Meier (23 January 1699); see ''Akademie'' I.14, p. 548 or I.16, p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless it was a very original work and it provided the author the first glimpse of fame among the scholars of his time.

==Summary==
The main idea behind the text is that of an [[alphabet of human thought]], which is attributed to [[Descartes]]. All concepts are nothing but combinations of a relatively small number of simple concepts, just as words are combinations of letters. All truths may be expressed as appropriate combinations of concepts, which can in turn be decomposed into simple ideas, rendering
the analysis much easier. Therefore, this alphabet would provide a logic of invention, opposed to that of demonstration which was known so far. Since all sentences are composed of a subject and a predicate, one might

* Find all the predicates which are appropriate to a given subject, or
* Find all the subjects which are convenient to a given predicate.

For this, Leibniz was inspired in the ''[[Ars Magna (Ramon Llull)|Ars Magna]]'' of [[Ramon Llull]], although he criticized this author because of the arbitrariness of his categories and his indexing.

Leibniz discusses in this work some combinatorial concepts. He had read [[Clavius|Clavius']] comments to the [[Tractatus de Sphaera]] of [[Sacrobosco]], and some other contemporary works. He introduced the term ''variationes ordinis'' for the permutations, ''combinationes'' for the combinations of two elements, ''con3nationes'' (shorthand for ''conternationes'') for those of three elements, etc. His general term for combinations was ''complexions''. He found the formula

:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose r} = {n-1\choose r} + {n-1\choose r-1}&lt;/math&gt;

which he thought was original.

The first examples of use of his '''''ars combinatoria''''' are taken from law, the musical registry of an [[organ (music)|organ]], and the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] theory of generation of elements from the four primary qualities. But philosophical applications are of greater importance. He cites the idea of [[Thomas Hobbes]] that all reasoning is just a computation.

The most careful example is taken from geometry, from where we shall give some definitions. He introduces the Class I concepts, which are primitive.

;Class I: 1 point, 2 space, 3 included, [...] 9 parts, 10 total, [...] 14 number, 15 various [...]

Class II contains simple combinations.

;Class II.1: Quantity is 14 των 9

Where των means "of the" (from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:τῶν|τῶν]]}}). Thus, "Quantity" is the number of the parts. Class III contains the ''con3nationes'':

;Class III.1: Interval is 2.3.10

Thus, "Interval" is the space included in total. Of course, concepts deriving from former classes may also be defined.

;Class IV.1: Line is 1/3 των 2

Where 1/3 means the first concept of class III. Thus, a "line" is the interval of (between) points.

Leibniz compares his  system to the Chinese and Egyptian languages, although he did not really understand them at this point. For him, this is a first step towards the [[Characteristica Universalis]], the perfect language which would provide a direct representation of ideas along with a calculus for the philosophical reasoning.

As a preface, the work begins with a proof of the existence of God, cast in geometrical form, and based on the [[Argument from Motion]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44469">'''Developmental language disorder''' ('''DLD''') is identified when a child has problems with language development that continue into school age and beyond. The language problems have a significant impact on everyday social interactions or educational progress, and occur in the absence of [[autism spectrum]] disorder, [[intellectual disability]] or a known biomedical condition. The most obvious problems are difficulties in using words and sentences to express meanings, but for many children, understanding of language (receptive language) is also a challenge, although this may not be evident unless the child is given a formal assessment.

==Classification==
===Terminology===
The term '''developmental language disorder''' ('''DLD''') was endorsed in a consensus study involving a panel of experts (CATALISE Consortium) in 2017...&lt;ref name=Bishop2017&gt;Bishop, D. V. M., Snowling, M. J., Thompson, P. A., Greenhalgh, T., &amp; The CATALISE Consortium. (2017). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.12721/abstract Phase 2 of CATALISE: a multinational and multidisciplinary Delphi consensus study of problems with language development: Terminology]. Journal of Child Psychology &amp; Psychiatry. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0158753
&lt;/ref&gt; The study was conducted in response to concerns that a wide range of terminology was used in this area, with the consequence that there was poor communication, lack of public recognition, and in some cases children were denied access to services. Developmental language disorder is a subset of language disorder, which is itself a subset of the broader category of speech, language and communication needs (SLCN).

The terminology for children’s language disorders has been extremely wide-ranging and confusing, with many labels that have overlapping but not necessarily identical meanings.&lt;ref name=Bishop2014&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (2014). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1460-6984.12101/abstract Ten questions about terminology for children with unexplained language problems]. International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders, 49(4), 381-415. doi:10.1111/1460-6984.12101
&lt;/ref&gt; In part this confusion reflected uncertainty about the boundaries of DLD, and the existence of different subtypes. Historically, the terms ‘’developmental dysphasia’’ or ‘’developmental aphasia’’ were used to describe children with the clinical picture of DLD.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, T. T. S., &amp; Reid, J. F. (1956). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2011959/ Developmental aphasia observed in a department of child psychiatry]. Archives of Disease in Childhood, 31, 161-172. 
&lt;/ref&gt; These terms have, however, largely been abandoned, as they suggest parallels with adult acquired [[aphasia]]. This is misleading, as DLD is not caused by brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;Rapin, I. (1996). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1996.tb01456.x/abstract Developmental language disorders: a clinical update]. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 37, 643-655. doi:10.1111/j.1469-7610.1996.tb01456.x
&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term DLD has been used for many years, it has been less common than the term [[Specific language impairment]] (SLI),&lt;ref name=Bishop2014 /&gt; which has been widely adopted, especially in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, L. B. (1991). [http://lshss.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1777973 Specific language impairment as a clinical category]. Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools, 22, 66-68. doi:10.1044/0161-1461.2202.66&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of SLI overlaps with DLD, but was rejected by the CATALISE panel because it was seen as overly restrictive in implying that the child had relatively pure problems with language in the absence of any other impairments. Children with such selective problems are relatively rare, and there is no evidence that they respond differently to intervention, or have different causal factors, from other children with language problems.&lt;ref name=Bishop2016&gt;Bishop, D. V. M., Snowling, M. J., Thompson, P. A., Greenhalgh, T., &amp; The CATALISE Consortium. (2016). [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158753 CATALISE: a multinational and multidisciplinary Delphi consensus study]. Identifying language impairments in children. PLOS One, 11(7), e0158753. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0158753
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK education system the term '''Speech, Language and Communication Needs (SLCN)''' is widely used, but this is far broader than DLD, and includes children with speech, language and social communication difficulties arising from a wide range of causes.&lt;ref&gt;Bercow, J. (2008). [http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/bercowreview The Bercow Report: A Review of Services for Children and Young People (0-19) with Speech, Language and Communication Needs]. Nottingham: DCSF Publications. However, the UK special educational needs system uses SLCN in a manner which is more similar to DLD.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of whether to refer to children's language problems as ‘disorder’ was a topic of debate among the CATALISE consortium, but the conclusion was that ‘disorder’ conveyed the serious nature and potential consequences of persistent language deficits. It is also parallel with other neurodevelopmental conditions and consistent with diagnostic frameworks such as [[DSM5]] and [[ICD-11]].&lt;ref name=Bishop2017 /&gt; Where there are milder or more transient difficulties, language difficulties may be a more appropriate term.

===Types of language difficulty===
DLD can affect a range of areas of language and the degree of impairment in different areas of language can vary from child to child.&lt;ref&gt;van Weerdenburg, M., Verhoeven, L., &amp; van Balkom, H. (2006). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01454.x/abstract Towards a typology of specific language impairment]. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 47(2), 176-189. 
&lt;/ref&gt; However, although there have been attempts to define different subtypes, these have not generally resulted in robust categories.&lt;ref&gt;Conti-Ramsden, G., &amp; Botting, N. (1999). [http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781170 Classification of children with specific language impairment: Longitudinal considerations]. Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research, 42(5), 1195-1204. 
&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendation of the CATALISE panel was that the specific areas of impairment should be assessed and documented for individual children, while recognizing that different children might have different combinations of problems. The areas which can be affected are:
* [[Grammar]] – This involves the ability to combine words into grammatically correct sentences (syntax) and to combine parts of words together (morphology) such as adding grammatical endings to verbs like –ing or –ed or to add prefixes and suffixes like dis- or –ation. For instance, a child may say 'me jump here', instead of 'I jumped here'.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, L. B. (2014). Children with specific language impairment, 2nd edition. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; Comprehension of sentences can also be affected. For instance, there may be difficulty understanding meaning expressed by word order, and so confusion about what is blue in a sentence like 'the pencil on the shoe is blue',&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (1982). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1982.tb00045.x/abstract Comprehension of spoken, written and signed sentences in childhood language disorders]. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 23, 1-20. 
&lt;/ref&gt; and a tendency to use general knowledge rather than linguistic cues to meaning,&lt;ref&gt;Paul, R. (1990). [http://journals.lww.com/topicsinlanguagedisorders/citation/1990/06000/comprehension_strategies__interactions_between.7.aspx Comprehension strategies: interactions between world knowledge and the development of sentence comprehension]. Topics in Language Disorders, 10(3), 63-75. 
&lt;/ref&gt; or problems in interpreting grammatical markers of number or tense.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, L. B., &amp; Deevy, P. (2010). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3640588/|Tense and aspect in sentence interpretation by children with specific language impairment]. Journal of Child Language, 37(2), 395-418. 
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Semantics]] – This refers to children’s ability to understand the meaning of words and how meanings are expressed by combining words together. Children with DLD often have limited vocabulary and may make heavy use of a small set of words with rather general meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, M. L., &amp; Bode, J. V. (1993). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/014272379301303707 GAPS in the verb lexicons of children with specific language impairment]. First Language, 13(37), 113-131. doi:10.1177/014272379301303707
&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Word finding – Children with word finding difficulties may know a word, but have difficulty accessing it for production&lt;ref&gt;German, D. J. (1992 ). [http://journals.lww.com/topicsinlanguagedisorders/citation/1992/11000/word_finding_intervention_for_children_and.6.aspx Word finding intervention for children and adolescents]. Topics in Language Disorders, 13, 33-50. 
&lt;/ref&gt; - similar to the [[Tip of the tongue]] phenomenon.
* [[Pragmatics]] - Pragmatics refers to the ability to select the appropriate message, or interpret what others say, in relation to context. Pragmatic difficulties can give an impression of oddity, with the content of language not fitting the environmental or social context; comprehension may be over-literal; the child may chatter incessantly, be poor at turn-taking in conversation and maintaining a topic &lt;ref&gt;Adams, C. (2001). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1080/lcd.36.3.289.305/abstract Clinical diagnostic and intervention studies of children with semantic-pragmatic language disorder]. International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders, 36, 289-305. 
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discourse]] – Discourse refers to a level of organisation of language beyond the sentence. Child with limitations in this domain may have limited ability to tell a story or describe a set of events in a logical sequence &lt;ref&gt;Van der Lely, H. K. J. (1997). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9154015 Narrative discourse in Grammatical specific language impairment: a modular language deficit?] Journal of Child Language, 24, 221-256. 
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Verbal memory]] and learning – Problems with remembering words or sentences can affect both the learning of new vocabulary,&lt;ref&gt;Gathercole, S. (1993). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/026565909300900302 Word learning in language impaired children]. Child Language Teaching and Therapy, 9, 187-199. doi:10.1177/026565909300900302
&lt;/ref&gt; and the understanding of long or complex sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, J. (2002). [http://journals.lww.com/topicsinlanguagedisorders/Abstract/2002/05000/Information_Processing_and_Language_Comprehension.7.aspx Information processing and language comprehension in children with specific language impairment]. Topics in Language Disorders, 22, 62-84. 
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phonology]] – Phonology is the branch of linguistics concerned with the way sounds are combined together in words. Children with difficulties with phonology may fail to distinguish between certain speech sounds, such as 't' and 'k', so that 'cake' is produced as 'tate'. Such difficulties are not unusual as part of typical development in toddlers, but they would usually resolve by the time children are 4–5 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Rvachew, S., &amp; Brosseau-Lapre, F. (2012). Developmental Phonological Disorders: Foundations of clinical Practice: Plural Publishing Inc.
&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties with producing some speech sounds accurately may reduce intelligibility of speech.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, E. S., &amp; Flint, C. B. (2006). [http://lshss.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1762909 Measurement of intelligibility in disordered speech]. Language Speech and Hearing Services in Schools, 37(3), 191-199. doi:10.1044/0161-1461(2006/021)
&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, more subtle difficulties in recognising specific sounds in words ([[phonological awareness]]) can lead to literacy difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Kamhi, A. G., Catts, H. W., Mauer, D., Apel, K., &amp; Gentry, B. F. (1988). [https://jshd.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1775118 Phonological and spatial processing abilities in language- and reading-impaired children]. Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders, 53, 316-327. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with speech disorders===
[[Speech]] is the act of articulating sounds, and this can be impaired for all kinds of reasons – a structural problem such as [[cleft lip and cleft palate]], a neurological problem affecting motor control of the speech apparatus [[Dysarthria]], or inability to perceive distinctions between sounds because of [[Hearing loss]]. Some distortions of speech sounds, such as a [[Lisp]], are commonly seen in young children. These misarticulations should not be confused with language problems, which involve the ability to select and combine linguistic elements to express meanings, and the ability to comprehend meanings. 
Although speech disorders can be distinguished from language disorders, they can also co-occur.&lt;ref&gt;Shriberg, L. D., Tomblin, J. B., &amp; McSweeny, J. L. (1999). [http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781216 Prevalence of speech delay in 6-year-old children and comorbidity with language impairment]. Journal of Speech, Language and Hearing Research, 42(6), 1461-1481. 
&lt;/ref&gt; When a child fails to produce distinctions between speech sounds for no obvious reason, this is typically regarded as a language problem affecting the learning of phonological contrasts. The classification of and terminology for disorders of speech sound production is a subject of considerable debate.&lt;ref&gt;Waring, R., &amp; Knight, R. (2013). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-6984.2012.00195.x/abstract How should children with speech sound disorders be classified? A review and critical evaluation of current classification systems]. International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders, 48(1), 25-40. doi:10.1111/j.1460-6984.2012.00195.x
&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, even for those with specialist skills, it is not always easy to distinguish between phonological disorders and other types of speech production problem.
[[Speech sound disorder]] (SSD) is any problem with speech production arising from any cause.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, C. (2015). Children's Speech Sound Disorders (2nd ed.). Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell.
&lt;/ref&gt;  
Speech Sound Disorders of unknown cause that are not accompanied by other language problems are a relatively common reason for young children to be referred to speech-language therapy (speech-language pathology).&lt;ref&gt;Broomfield, J., &amp; Dodd, B. (2004). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1080/13682820310001625589/abstract Children with speech and language disability: caseload characteristics]. International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders, 39, 303-324. 
&lt;/ref&gt; These often resolve by around 4–5 years of age with specialist intervention,&lt;ref&gt;Law, J., Garrett, Z., &amp; Nye, C. (2003). [http://www.cochrane.org/CD004110/BEHAV_speech-and-language-therapy-interventions-for-children-with-primary-speech-and-language-delay-or-disorder Speech and language therapy interventions for children with primary speech and language delay or disorder (Cochrane Review)]. The Cochrane Library, 3. 
&lt;/ref&gt; and so would not meet criteria for DLD. Where such problems continue beyond 5 years of age, they are usually accompanied by problems in broader language domains and have a poorer prognosis,&lt;ref name=Bishop1987&gt;Bishop, D. V. M., &amp; Edmundson, A. (1987). [https://jshd.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1774916 Language-impaired four-year-olds: distinguishing transient from persistent impairment]. Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders, 52, 156-173. 
&lt;/ref&gt; so a diagnosis of DLD with SSD is then appropriate.

===Relationship with other neurodevelopmental disorders===
DLD often co-occurs with milder neurodevelopmental disorders of unknown origin, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental dyslexia or developmental co-ordination disorder.&lt;ref name=Bishop2016 /&gt; These do not preclude a diagnosis of DLD, but should be noted as co-occurring conditions.

==Risk factors==
It is generally accepted that DLD is strongly influenced by genetic factors.&lt;ref name=Bishop2006&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (2006). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2582396/ What causes specific language impairment in children?] Current Directions in Psychological Science, 15, 217-221. 
&lt;/ref&gt; The best evidence comes from the [[Twin study]] method. Two twins growing up together are exposed to the same home environment, yet may differ radically in their language skills. Such different outcomes are, however, much more common in fraternal (non-identical) twins, who are genetically different. Identical twins share the same genes and tend to be much more similar in language ability. There can be some variation in the severity and persistence of DLD in identical twins, indicating that non-genetic factors affect the course of disorder, but it is unusual to find a child with DLD who has an identical twin with typical language.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V. M., North, T., &amp; Donlan, C. (1995). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8749.1995.tb11932.x/abstract Genetic basis of specific language impairment: evidence from a twin study]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 37, 56-71. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

There was considerable excitement when a large, multigenerational family with a high rate of DLD were found to have a mutation of the [[FOXP2]] gene just in the affected family members.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, S. E., Vargha Khadem, F., Watkins, K. E., Monaco, A. P., &amp; Pembrey, M. E. (1998). [https://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v18/n2/abs/ng0298-168.html Localisation of a gene implicated in a severe speech and language disorder]. Nature Genetics, 18, 168-170. 
&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent studies have found that, though DLD runs in families, it is not usually caused by a mutation in FOXP2 or another specific gene.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, S. E. (2006). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027706000746?via%3Dihub Tangled webs: Tracing the connections between genes and cognition]. Cognition, 101(2), 270-297. doi:10.1016/j.cognition.2006.04.004
&lt;/ref&gt; Current evidence suggests that there are many different genes that can influence language learning, and DLD results when a child inherits a particularly detrimental combination of risk factors, each of which may have only a small effect.&lt;ref name=Bishop2006/&gt; Nevertheless, study of the mode of action of the FOXP2 gene has helped identify other common genetic variants involved in the same neural pathways that may play a part in causing DLD.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, S. E., &amp; Scharff, C. (2009). [http://www.cell.com/genetics/abstract/S0168-9525(09)00043-2 FOXP2 as a molecular window into speech and language]. Trends in genetics, 25(4), 166-177. doi:10.1016/j.tig.2009.03.002&lt;/ref&gt;

Language disorders are associated with aspects of home environment, and it is often assumed that this is a causal link, with poor language stimulation leading to weak language skills. Twin studies, however, show that two children in the same home environment can have very different language outcomes, suggesting we should consider other explanations for the link. Children with DLD often grow up into adults who have relatively low educational attainments,&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse, A. J. O., Watt, H. J., Line, E. A., &amp; Bishop, D. V. M. (2009). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2835860/ Adult psychosocial outcomes of children with specific language impairment, pragmatic language impairment and autism]. International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders, 44, 511-528. 
&lt;/ref&gt; and their children may share a genetic risk for language disorder.&lt;ref name=Bishop2014 /&gt;

One non-genetic factor that is known to have a specific impact on language development is being a younger sibling in a large family.&lt;ref&gt;Fundudis, T., Kolvin, I., &amp; Garside, R. (1979). Speech Retarded and Deaf Children: Their Psychological Development. London: Academic Press.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associated factors===
It has long been noted that males are more affected by DLD than females, with a sex ratio of affected males: females around 3 or 4:1 &lt;ref&gt;Robinson, R. J. (1991). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8749.1991.tb14811.x/abstract Causes and associations of severe and persistent specific speech and language disorders in children]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 33, 943–962.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the sex difference is much less striking in epidemiological samples, suggesting that similar problems may exist in females but are less likely to be detected.&lt;ref name=Norbury2016 /&gt; The reason for the sex difference is not well understood.

Poor motor skills are commonly found in children with DLD.&lt;ref&gt;Hill EL (2001). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1080/13682820010019874/abstract Non-specific nature of specific language impairment: a review of the literature with regard to concomitant motor impairments.] International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders, 36 (2): 149–71. doi:10.1080/13682820010019874. {{PMID|11344592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brain scans do not usually reveal any obvious abnormalities in children with DLD, although quantitative comparisons have found differences in brain size or relative proportions of white or grey matter in specific regions.&lt;ref&gt;Jernigan TL, Hesselink JR, Sowell E, Tallal PA (May 1991). [http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/590865 Cerebral structure on magnetic resonance imaging in language- and learning-impaired children.] Archives of Neurology, 48 (5): 539–45. doi:10.1001/archneur.1991.00530170103028. {{PMID|2021369}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, unusual brain gyri are found.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson T, Plante E (1996). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01875369?LI=true Gyral morphology in the posterior Sylvian region in families affected by developmental language disorder]. Neuropsychology Review 6 (2): 81–94. doi:10.1007/bf01875369. {{PMID|8976499}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; To date, no consistent 'neural signature' for DLD has been found, although some studies have noted evidence for involvement of subcortical systems.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnan, S., Watkins, K., &amp; Bishop, D. V. M. (2016). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661316300833 Neurobiological basis of language learning difficulties]. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 20(9), 701-714. doi:10.1016/j.tics.2016.06.012
&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in the brains of children with DLD vs typically developing children are subtle and may overlap with atypical patterns seen in other neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert MR, Kenet T (2007). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031395507000363 Brain abnormalities in language disorders and in autism.] Pediatric Clinics of North America, 54 (3): 563–83, vii. doi:10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.007. {{PMID|17543910}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
DLD is defined purely in behavioural terms: there is no biological test. There are three points that need to be met for a diagnosis of DLD:&lt;ref name=Bishop2017 /&gt;
# The child has language difficulties that create obstacles to communication or learning in everyday life,
# The child's language problems are unlikely to resolve by five years of age, and 
# The problems are not associated with a known biomedical condition such as brain injury, neurodegenerative conditions, genetic conditions or chromosome disorders such as [[Down Syndrome]], sensorineural [[hearing loss]], or [[Autism Spectrum]] Disorder or [[Intellectual Disability]].
 
For research and epidemiological purposes, specific cutoffs on language assessments have been used to document the first criterion. Tomblin et al.&lt;ref&gt;Tomblin, J. B., Records, N. L., &amp; Zhang, X. (1996). [http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781254 A system for the diagnosis of Specific Language Impairment in kindergarten children]. Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research, 39(6), 1284. doi:10.1044/jshr.3906.1284
&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the EpiSLI criterion, based on five composite scores representing performance in three domains of language (vocabulary, grammar, and narration) and two modalities (comprehension and production). Children scoring in the lowest 10% on two or more composite scores are identified as having language disorder.

The second criterion, persistence of language problems, can be difficult to judge in a young child, but longitudinal studies have shown that difficulties are less likely to resolve for children who have poor language comprehension, rather than difficulties confined to expressive language.&lt;ref name=Bishop2017 /&gt; In addition, children with isolated difficulties in just one of the areas noted under 'subtypes' tend to make better progress than those whose language is impaired in several areas.&lt;ref name=Bishop1987 /&gt;

The third criterion specifies that DLD is used for children whose language disorder is not part of another biomedical condition, such as a genetic syndrome, a sensorineural hearing loss, neurological disease, Autism Spectrum Disorder or Intellectual Disability – these were termed 'differentiating conditions' by the CATALISE panel.&lt;ref name=Bishop2017 /&gt; Language disorders occurring with these conditions need to be assessed and children offered appropriate intervention, but a terminological distinction is made so that these cases would be diagnosed as Language Disorder associated with &lt;mark&gt;___&lt;/mark&gt;, with the main diagnosis being specified: e.g. "Language Disorder associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder." The reasoning behind these diagnostic distinctions is discussed further by Bishop (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=|first1=|date=|year=2017|title=Why is it so hard to reach agreement on terminology? The case of developmental language disorder (DLD)|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1460-6984.12335/full|journal=International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders|volume=52|pages=|doi=10.1111/1460-6984.12335|via=|author-last=Bishop|author-first=D. V. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
Assessment will usually include an interview with the child’s caregiver, observation of the child in an unstructured setting, a hearing test, and standardized tests of language.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, R. (2006). Language Disorders from Infancy through Adolescence: Assessment and Intervention, 3rd Edition. St. Louis: Mosby-Year Book.
&lt;/ref&gt; There is a wide range of language assessments in English. Some are restricted for use by experts in [[speech-language pathology]]: speech and language therapists (SaLTs/SLTs) in the UK, speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in the US and Australia. A commonly used test battery for diagnosis of DLD is the [http://www.pearsonclinical.co.uk/Psychology/ChildCognitionNeuropsychologyandLanguage/ChildLanguage/ClinicalEvaluationofLanguageFundamentals-FourthEditionUK(CELF-4UK)/ClinicalEvaluationofLanguageFundamentals-FourthEditionUK(CELF-4UK).aspx Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF)]. 
Assessments that can be completed by a parent or teacher can be useful to identify children who may require more in-depth evaluation. The [http://www.pearsonclinical.co.uk/Psychology/ChildCognitionNeuropsychologyandLanguage/ChildLanguage/ChildrensCommunicationChecklist(CCC-2)/ChildrensCommunicationChecklist(CCC-2).aspx Children’s Communication Checklist (CCC–2)] is a parent questionnaire suitable for assessing everyday use of language in children aged 4 years and above who can speak in sentences. 
Informal assessments, such as language samples, are often used by speech-language therapists/pathologists to complement formal testing and give an indication of the child's language in a more naturalistic context. A language sample may be of a conversation or narrative retell. In a narrative language sample, an adult may tell the child a story using a wordless picture book (e.g. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Frog_Where_Are_You.html?id=Asi5KQAACAAJ&amp;hl=en Frog Where Are You?, Mayer, 1969]), then ask the child to use the pictures and tell the story back. Language samples can be transcribed using computer software such as the [http://www.saltsoftware.com/ Systematic Analysis of Language Software], and then analyzed for a range of features: e.g., the grammatical complexity of the child's utterances,  whether the child introduces characters to their story or jumps right in, whether the events follow a logical order, and whether the narrative includes a main idea or theme and supporting details.

==Treatment==
Treatment is usually carried out by speech and language therapists/pathologists, who use a wide range of techniques to stimulate language learning.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, F. P., &amp; Worthington, C. K. (2010). Treatment resource manual for speech-language pathology, 4th edition. San Diego: Singular Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, there was a vogue for drilling children in grammatical exercises, using imitation and elicitation, but such methods fell into disuse when it became apparent that there was little generalisation to everyday situations. Contemporary approaches to enhancing development of language structure, for younger children at least, are more likely to adopt 'milieu' methods, in which the intervention is interwoven into natural episodes of communication, and the therapist builds on the child's utterances, rather than dictating what will be talked about. Interventions for older children, may be more explicit, telling the children what areas are being targeted and giving explanations regarding the rules and structures they are learning, often with visual supports,.&lt;ref&gt;Ebbels, S.H., [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1191/0265659007072143?journalCode=clta Teaching grammar to school-aged children with Specific Language Impairment using Shape Coding]. Child Language Teaching and Therapy, 2007. 23(1): p. 67-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, A., Colourful Semantics., in Language disorders in children and adults: psycholinguistic approaches to therapy., S. Chiat, J. Law, and J. Marshall, Editors. 1997, Whurr: London&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there has been a move away from a focus solely on grammar and phonology toward interventions that develop children's social use of language, often working in small groups that may include typically developing as well as language-impaired peers.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Gallagher, T. (1996). Social-interactional approaches to child language intervention. In J. Beitchman, N. J. Cohen, M. M. Konstantareas &amp; R. Tannock (Eds.), Language, Learning and Behavior Disorders: Developmental, Biological and Clinical Perspectives (pp. 493–514). New York: Cambridge University Press.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way in contemporary remediation differ from the past is that parents are more likely to be directly involved, but this approach is largely used with preschool children, rather than those whose problems persist into school age.,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, M.Y. and A.P. Kaiser (2011) [http://ajslp.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1757532 The effectiveness of parent-implemented language interventions: A meta-analysis]. American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology, 20(3), 180-199&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tosh, R., W. Arnott, and N. Scarinci, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1460-6984.12280/abstract Parent-implemented home therapy programs for speech and language: A systematic review]. International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

For school-aged children, teachers are increasingly involved in intervention, either in collaboration with speech and language therapists/pathologists, or as the main agents of delivery of the intervention. Evidence for the benefits of a collaborative approach is emerging,&lt;ref&gt;Archibald, L.(2017). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2396941516680369 SLP-Educator classroom collaboration: A review to inform reason-based practice.] Autism and Developmental Language Impairments, 2. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/2396941516680369&lt;/ref&gt; but the benefits of asking education staff to be the main deliverers of SLT intervention (the “consultative” approach) are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;McCartney, E., et al., [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3109/13682820903560302/abstract Indirect language therapy for children with persistent language impairment in mainstream primary schools: outcomes from a cohort intervention]. International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders, 2011. 46(1), 74-82.&lt;/ref&gt; When SLT intervention is delivered indirectly by trained SLT assistants, however, there are indications that this can be effective.&lt;ref&gt;Mecrow, C., J. Beckwith, and T. Klee, An exploratory trial of the effectiveness of an enhanced consultative approach to delivering speech and language intervention in schools. International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders, 2010. 45(3): p. 354-367. DOI: 10.3109/13682820903560302&lt;/ref&gt;

A radically different approach has been developed by Tallal and colleagues, who devised a computer-based intervention, FastForWord, that involves prolonged and intensive training on specific components of language and auditory processing.&lt;ref&gt;Tallal, P. (2000). Experimental studies of language learning impairments: From research to remediation. In D. V. M. Bishop &amp; L. B. Leonard (Eds.), Speech and Language Impairments in Children: Causes, Characteristics, Intervention and Outcome (pp. 131–155). Hove, UK: Psychology Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; The theory underlying FastForword maintains that language difficulties are caused by a failure to make fine-grained auditory discriminations in the temporal dimension, and the computerised training materials are designed to sharpen perceptual acuity. However, a systematic review of clinical trials assessing FastForWord reported no significant gains relative to a control group.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, G. K., Torgerson, C. J., Torgerson, D., &amp; Hulme, C. (2010). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02329.x/full A systematic meta-analytic review of evidence for the effectiveness of the ‘Fast ForWord’ language intervention program]. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 52(3), 224-235. doi:10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02329.x
&lt;/ref&gt;

In this field, [[Randomized controlled trial]] methodology has not been widely used, and this makes it difficult to assess clinical efficacy with confidence. Children's language will tend to improve over time, and without controlled studies, it can be hard to know how much of observed change is down to a specific treatment. There is, however, increasing evidence that direct 1:1 intervention with an SLT/P can be effective for improving vocabulary and expressive language.&lt;ref&gt;Law, J., Garrett, Z., &amp; Nye, C. (2004). [https://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781483 The efficacy of treatment for children with developmental speech and language delay/disorder: a meta-analysis].

 doi:10.1044/1092-4388(2004/069) {{PMID|15324296}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; There have been few studies of interventions that target receptive language,&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, J., McCartney, E., O'Hare, A., &amp; Law, J. (2010). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8749.2010.03750.x/full Intervention for mixed receptive-expressive language impairment: a review]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 52(11), 994-999. doi:10.1111/j.1469-8749.2010.03750.x
&lt;/ref&gt; though some positive outcomes have been reported.,&lt;ref&gt;Ebbels, S.H.(2014).

==Outcome==
[[Longitudinal studies]] indicate that problems are largely resolved by 5 years of age in around 40% of 4-year-olds with early language delays who have no other presenting risk factors.&lt;ref name=Bishop1987 /&gt; However, for children who still have significant language difficulties at school entry, reading problems are common, even for children who receive specialist help,&lt;ref&gt;Catts, H. W., Fey, M. E., Tomblin, J. B., &amp; Zhang, X. (2002). [http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781088 A longitudinal investigation of reading outcomes in children with language impairments]. Journal of Speech, Language and Hearing Research, 45, 1142-1157. 
&lt;/ref&gt; and educational attainments are typically poor.&lt;ref&gt;Snowling, M. J., Adams, J. W., Bishop, D. V. M., &amp; Stothard, S. E. (2001). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1080/13682820120976/abstract Educational attainments of school-leavers with a pre-school history of speech-language impairments]. International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders, 36, 173-183. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Poor outcomes are most common in cases where comprehension as well as expressive language is affected.&lt;ref&gt;Simkin, Z., &amp; Conti-Ramsden, G. (2006). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1191/0265659006ct310xx Evidence of reading difficulty in subgroups of children with specific language impairment]. Child Language Teaching and Therapy, 22, 315-331. 
&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that scores on tests of nonverbal ability of children with DLD decrease over the course of development.&lt;ref&gt;Botting, N. (2005). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00355.x/abstract Non-verbal cognitive development and language impairment]. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 46(3), 317-326. doi:10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00355.x&lt;/ref&gt;

DLD is associated with an elevated risk of social, emotional and mental health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Nancy (2001). Language impairment and psychopathology in infants, children, and adolescents. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications. {{ISBN|0-7619-2025-0}}. OCLC&amp;nbsp;45749780.
&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in a UK survey, 64% of a sample of 11-year-olds with DLD scored above a clinical threshold on a questionnaire for psychiatric difficulties, and 36% were regularly bullied, compared with 12% of comparison children.&lt;ref&gt;Conti-Ramsden, G., &amp; Botting, N. (2004). [http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781421 Social difficulties and victimization in children with SLI at 11 years of age.] Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, 47, 145-161. 
&lt;/ref&gt; In the longer-term, studies of adult outcomes of children with DLD have found elevated rates of unemployment, social isolation and psychiatric disorder among those with early comprehension difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, J., Hollis, C., Mawhood, L., &amp; Rutter, M. (2005). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00342.x/abstract Developmental language disorders - a follow-up in later life. Cognitive, language and psychosocial outcomes.] Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 46, 128-149. 
&lt;/ref&gt; However, better outcomes are found for children who have milder difficulties and do not require special educational provision.&lt;ref&gt;Snowling, M. J., Bishop, D. V. M., Stothard, S. E., Chipchase, B., &amp; Kaplan, C. (2006).

Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 47, 759-765. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
Epidemiological surveys, in the US&lt;ref&gt;Tomblin, J. B., Records, N. L., Buckwalter, P., Zhang, X., Smith, E., &amp; O'Brien, M. (1997). [http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781924 Prevalence of specific language impairment in kindergarten children]. Journal of Speech and Hearing Research, 40(6), 1245-1260. 
&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK&lt;ref name=Norbury2016&gt;Norbury, C. F., Gooch, D., Wray, C., Baird, G., Charman, T., Simonoff, E., . . . Pickles, A. (2016). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.12573/full The impact of nonverbal ability on prevalence and clinical presentation of language disorder: evidence from a population study.] Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, n/a-n/a. doi:10.1111/jcpp.12573
&lt;/ref&gt; converge in estimating the prevalence of DLD in 5-year-olds at around 7 percent.

==Research==
Much research has focused on trying to identify what makes language learning so hard for some children.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (1997). Uncommon Understanding: Development and Disorders of Language Comprehension in Children. Hove: Psychology Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; A major divide is between theories that attribute the difficulties to a low-level problem with auditory temporal processing,&lt;ref&gt;Tallal, P., &amp; Piercy, M. (1973). [https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v241/n5390/abs/241468a0.html Defects of non-verbal auditory perception in children with developmental dysphasia]. Nature, 241, 468-469. 
&lt;/ref&gt; and those that propose there is a deficit in a specialised language-learning system.,.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, M. L., Wexler, K., &amp; Cleave, P. L. (1995). [http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1780857 Specific language impairment as a period of extended optional infinitive]. Journal of Speech and Hearing Research, 38, 850-863. 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van der Lely, H. K. J. (2005). [http://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(04)00296-7?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1364661304002967%3Fshowall%3Dtrue Domain-specific cognitive systems: insight from Grammatical-SLI]. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 9, 53-59. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts emphasise deficits in specific aspects of learning and memory.,.&lt;ref&gt;Gathercole, S. E., &amp; Baddeley, A. D. (1990). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0749596X9090004J Phonological memory deficits in language disordered children: is there a causal connection?] Journal of Memory and Language, 29, 336-360.

&lt;/ref&gt; It can be difficult to choose between theories because they do not always make distinctive predictions, and there is considerable heterogeneity among children with DLD. It has also been suggested that DLD may only arise when more than one underlying deficit is present.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (2006).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3890">'''Dialogical analysis''', or more precisely '''dialogical interaction analysis''', refers to a way of analyzing human communication which is based on the theory of [[dialogism]]. The approach has been developed based on the theoretical work of [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Bakhtin]].

==Overview==
[[Dialogism]] makes several assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;([https://books.google.com/books?id=8ir3M0yOjGIC&amp;printsec=frontcover Linell, 2009]).&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes that human communication entails the interaction of diverse perspectives and is embedded in a socio-historical context, that the meaning of a communication can be different to the various participants, that it is important to examine the consequences of a communication, and that each participant in a communication is, to some degree, orienting to the orientation of the other.

Dialogical analysis is an interpretative methodology which closely analyzes spoken or written utterances or actions for their embedded communicative significance. Questions typically asked during a dialogical analysis include: What does each interactant think about themselves, the other and what the other thinks of them? What do the given utterances and actions imply about the given activity or participants? Why was a given communicative act performed &amp;ndash; why did it need to be said? What was the alternative that the utterance was trying to dispel? People are often borrowing words, phrases and ideas from other people, and accordingly, dialogical analysis often asks: who is doing the talking? Specifically, which voices and echoes are evident in the given utterance?

Although dialogical analysis tends to focus on discourse, it is distinct from [[discourse analysis]] and [[conversation analysis]] because its focus goes beyond the question of how people speak and what they achieve by speaking. Dialogical analysis uses dialogue as a metaphor for understanding phenomena beyond communication itself, such as the self (see [[dialogical self]]), internal dialogues, self-talk, misunderstandings, trust and distrust,&lt;ref&gt;([https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ut1yKKJGxVIC&amp;printsec=frontcover Markova &amp; Gillespie, 2007])&lt;/ref&gt; the production of knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;([https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WYNFT16NpMQC&amp;printsec=frontcover Jovchelovitch, 2008])&lt;/ref&gt; and relations between groups in society.&lt;ref&gt;([https://gcal.academia.edu/documents/0010/3091/Cornish___Ghosh_2007_Necessary_contradictions_of_community_led_health_promotion.pdf Cornish, 2007])&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently there have been attempts to formalize the move from dialogism, which is often quite theoretical, to a systematic methodology for data analysis. These approaches focus upon 'sensitizing questions' that facilitate a dialogical analysis&lt;ref&gt;([https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alex_Gillespie2/publication/261882642_Sensitizing_Questions_A_Method_to_Facilitate_Analyzing_the_Meaning_of_an_Utterance/links/55a4c32a08ae81aec913096a.pdf?origin=publication_list. "Gillespie &amp; Cornish, 2014"])&lt;/ref&gt; and step-by-step procedures for analyzing multivoicedness.&lt;ref&gt;([http://qrj.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/11/10/1468794114557991.full.pdf+html "Aveling, Gillespie &amp; Cornish 2015"])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dip Pen.jpg|thumb|A dip pen]]
[[File:Nibs various.jpg|thumb|right|Various models of dip pen nibs]]

A '''dip pen''' or ''[[Nib (pen)|nib]] pen'' usually consists of a metal nib with [[capillary action|capillary channels]] like those of [[Fountain pen|fountain-pen]] nibs, mounted in a handle or holder, often made of wood. Other materials can be used for the holder, including [[bone]], [[metal]], and [[plastic]]; some pens are made entirely of [[glass]]. Generally, dip pens have no [[ink]] reservoir, so the user must recharge the ink from an ink bowl or bottle to continue [[drawing]] or [[writing]]. There are simple, tiny tubular reservoirs that illustrators sometimes clip onto dip pens, which allow drawing for several minutes without recharging the nib. Recharging can be done by dipping into an [[inkwell]], but it is also possible to charge the pen with an eyedropper, a syringe, or a brush, which gives more control over the amount of ink applied. Thus, "dip pens" are not necessarily dipped; many illustrators call them "nib pens".

Dip pens emerged in the early 19th century, when they replaced [[quill pen]]s and, in some parts of the world, [[reed pen]]s. Dip pens were generally used before the development of [[fountain pen]]s in the later 19th century, and are now mainly used in [[illustration]], [[calligraphy]], and [[comics]].

The dip pen has certain advantages over a fountain pen. It can use waterproof, pigmented, particle-and-binder-based inks, such as [[India ink]], drawing ink, and acrylic inks—each of which would destroy a fountain pen by clogging it—and the traditional [[iron gall ink]], which can [[corrosion|corrode]] fountain pens. Dip pens are also more sensitive to variations of pressure and speed, producing a line that naturally varies in thickness; and they can also produce a finer line than any fountain pen.

There is a wide range of exchangeable nibs for dip pens, so different types of lines and effects can be created. The nibs and handles are far cheaper than most fountain pens, and allow color changes much more easily.

==History==
The earliest known split-nib metal dip pen is a surviving copper-alloy pen found in Roman Britain ({{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;43 to 410).&lt;ref name="brit_pen"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Pen, split nib – Romano-British period | author =  | work = British Museum | date =  | accessdate = 2016-12-04 | url = http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?assetId=633717001&amp;objectId=810252&amp;partId=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several other surviving all-metal and removable-nib pens from the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]] have been found, suggesting they were used alongside quill pens.&lt;ref name="coll_Muse"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Pen | website = Museum of London | accessdate = 2016-12-04 | url = http://collections.museumoflondon.org.uk/online/object/29605.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coll_Muse2"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Pen  | website = Museum of London | accessdate = 2016-12-04 | url = http://collections.museumoflondon.org.uk/online/object/36055.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="find_Reco"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Record ID: LIN-CDD296 – POST MEDIEVAL pen | author = Adam Daubney | work = The Portable Antiquities Scheme | date = 1600 | accessdate = 2016-12-04 | url = https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/176060 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="web._Bulg"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bulgarian archaeologists find unique set of pen nibs used in the Golden Age |author=Veliki Preslav |work=FOCUS Information Agency |date=2012-09-29 |accessdate=2016-12-04 |url=http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?id=n288661 |quote=We found an incredibly interesting and one of its kind set of 11 bronze pen nibs, which used to be put on the pens during the Golden Age of Simeon I of Bulgaria |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027141339/http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?id=n288661 |archivedate=2012-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The steel pen is first attested in Daniel Defoe's book "A Tour Through the Whole Island of Great Britain – 1724–26". In Letter VII Defoe wrote: "the plaster of the ceilings and walls in some rooms is so fine, so firm, so entire, that they break it off in large flakes, and it will bear writing on it with a pencil or steel pen." In Newhall Street, John Mitchell pioneered mass production of steel pens in 1822; prior to that the [[quill]] pen had been the most common form of writing instrument. His brother William Mitchell later set up his own pen making business in St Paul's square. The Mitchell family is credited as being the first manufacturers to use machines to cut pen nibs, which greatly sped up the process.

The [[Jewellery Quarter]] and surrounding area of [[Birmingham]], England was home to many of the first dip pen manufacturers, which some companies establishing there to produce pens. Some of those companies were [[Joseph Gillott's (pens)|Joseph Gillott's]] (established in 1827), Sir Josiah Mason (1827), Hink Wells &amp; Co. (1836), Baker and Finnemore (1850), C. Brandauer &amp; Co. (1850), [[D. Leonardt &amp; Co.]] (1856).&lt;ref name=pentrade/&gt;

Baker and Finnemore operated in James Street, near [[St Paul's Square, Birmingham|St Paul's Square]]. C Brandauer &amp; Co Ltd., founded as Ash &amp; Petit, traded at 70 Navigation Street. [[Joseph Gillott's (pens)|Joseph Gillott &amp; Sons Ltd.]] made pen nibs in Bread Street, now Cornwall Street. Hinks Wells &amp; Co. traded in Buckingham Street, Geo W Hughes traded in St Paul's Square, [[D. Leonardt &amp; Co.]]/Leonardt &amp; Catwinkle traded in George Street and Charlotte Street, and M Myers &amp; Son. were based at 8 [[Newhall Street]]. By 1830 John and William Mitchell, Joseph Gillott, and Josiah Mason were the major manufacturers in Birmingham.

[[File:Geohughes.JPG|thumb|left|Pen Nº 1163 by George W. Hughes, one of the most notable [[England|English]] pen manufacturers.]]
In Germany the industrial production of dip pens started in 1842 at the factory of [[Heintze &amp; Blanckertz]] in [[Berlin]].

By the 1850s, Birmingham existed as a world centre for steel pen and steel [[nib (pen)|nib]] manufacture. More than half the steel nib pens manufactured in the world were Birmingham-made. Thousands of skilled [[craft|craftsmen and women]] were employed in the industry. Many new manufacturing techniques were perfected in Birmingham, enabling the city's [[factory|factories]] to mass-produce their pens cheaply and efficiently. These were sold worldwide to many who previously could not afford to write, which encouraged the development of education and literacy. By 1860 there were about 100 companies making steel nibs in Birmingham, but 12 large firms dominated the trade. In 1870 Mason, Sommerville, Wiley, and Perry, merged to form [[Perry &amp; Co.|Perry &amp; Co. Ltd.]] which later became one of the largest manufacturers in the world, with near 2,000 employees.&lt;ref name=gracesguide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/wiki/Perry_and_Co|title=Perry and Co|work=gracesguide.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stainless steel pen nib by Joseph Schuler, Budapest, Hungary 1910.jpg|thumb|Advertising for pen nibs by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Joseph Schuler, 1910.]]
[[Esterbrook|Richard Esterbrook]] manufactured quill pens in Cornwall. In the 19th century, he saw a gap in the American market for steel nib pens. Esterbrook approached five craftsmen who worked for John Mitchell in Navigation Street with a view to setting up business in [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], [[New Jersey]], US. Esterbrook founded his company in 1858, and it grew to become one of the largest steel pen manufacturers in the world. In 1971 it went out of business.

The oblique dip pen was designed for writing the pointed pen styles of the mid 19th to the early 20th century such as [[Spencerian Script]], although oblique pen holders can be used for earlier styles of pointed penmanship such as the [[copperplate script]]s of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the name suggests, the nib holder holds the nib at an oblique angle of around 55° pointing to the right hand side of the penman. This feature helps greatly in achieving the steep angle required for writing certain scripts, but more importantly, it prevents the right hand nib tine from dragging on the paper as can be experienced when using a straight nib holder with a straight nib for this purpose.

The decreasing production of dip pens and the subsequent demise of the industry in Birmingham is often{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for this|date=September 2015}} blamed on the invention of the [[ballpoint pen]] in 1938 by the Hungarian [[Laszlo Biro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/pen-makers-william-mitchell-joseph-8040386 "Pen makers: William Mitchell and Joseph Gillott"], Birmingham Mail, 3 Nov 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa101697.htm "A Brief History of Writing Instruments, Part 3: The Battle of the Ballpoint Pens"] by Mary Bellis on About.com&lt;/ref&gt;

One improved version of the dip pen, known as the original "[[ballpoint pen|ballpoint]]", was the addition of a curved point (instead of a sharp point) which allows the user to have slightly more control on upward and sideways strokes. This feature, however, produces a thicker line rather than the razor-sharp line produced by a sharp point.

==Uses==
[[File:Dip pens Redis Feder Salcher 400 Wien.JPG|thumb|right|Pen used for nib painting]]
Dip pens continued in use in schools into the 1950s and 1960s, mainly on grounds of cost, since fountain pens were expensive to buy. Even when [[ballpoint pen]]s became cheaply available, some schools banned their use, perhaps because writing with a dip pen had to be done with greater care. School [[desk]]s were made with a socket for a small ceramic [[inkwell]] which had to be refilled on a daily basis, a task often delegated to one of the pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Webb |first=Simon |date=2013 |title=The Best Days of Our Lives: School Life in Post-War Britain |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=J4o7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30&amp;lpg=PT30&amp;dq=dip+pen+school+1960s&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NPeTLRQLct&amp;sig=gOGQZiHuytao_rEZ1wfxaBoDblA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY_sipuujTAhXHIcAKHb24BhgQ6AEIZDAN#v=onepage&amp;q=dip%20pen%20school%201960s&amp;f=false |location=Stroud (UK) |publisher=The History Press |page= |isbn= 978-0-7524-8936-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.throughouthistory.com/?p=474 |title=Dip Pens and their Accessories |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=19 December 2009 |website=www.throughouthistory.com |publisher= |access-date=11 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dip pens are rarely used now for regular writing, most commonly having been replaced by fountain pens, [[rollerball pens]], or ballpoint pens. However, dip pens are still appreciated by artists, as they can make great differences between thick and thin lines, and generally write more smoothly than other types of pens. Dip pens are also preferred by calligraphers for fine writing. Dip pens are still in use for nib paintings, mostly round tip ones with a slit in the centre. 

Although most of the factories ceased manufacturing dip pens,&lt;ref name=pentrade/&gt; some companies are still active, such as [[Speedball (art products)|Speedball]], Brause (currently owned by [[France|French]] company Exacompta Clairefontaine),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exaclair.com/brands_brause.php|title=Brause brand|website=exaclair.com|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultpens.com/c/q/brands/brause|title=Brause|work=cultpens.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.

'''Exemplification''', in the [[philosophy]] of language, is a mode of symbolization characterized by the relation between a sample and what it refers to.

== Description ==
Unlike [[ostension]], which is the act of showing or pointing to a sample, exemplification is possession of a property plus reference to its label (Goodman, 1976). For example, if a color sample has the property labelled 'green', then the color sample exemplifies green. At its most basic, possession of a property amounts to being correctly referred to by its label. In other words, an entity, 'x' can be said to possess a certain property if and only if: (1) there can be an abstract singular term which denotes that property, and (2) those assertions are true which predicate such an abstract term of a name or phrase denoting x. 
== A mode of reference ==

[[Reference]] is the relation between something "standing for" something else, like the relation between a word and what it denotes. Usually reference goes in one direction, from the word to what it denotes, but it may also go in both directions, from the denoted back to the word. For instance, when a patch of green paint is used as a colour sample. The sample refers to green by possessing it and thus being referred to by the word denoting it. The sample exemplifies green, it stands for it, and in this way exemplification is a mode of reference.

== Uses of exemplification ==

*Product samples exemplify certain properties they possess.
*As a part in [[ostensive definition]], i.e. definition by exemplification of what is defined. For example, an artist can define a new style by showing works that exemplify it.
*Defined exemplification is a pattern of essay development that uses specific instances (examples) to clarify a point, to add interest, or to persuade (Clouse, 2006).
*Exemplification means using examples to explain, convince, or amuse. Lending interest and information to writing, exemplification is one of the most common and effective ways to developing ideas. Examples may be developed in a sentence or more, or they may be only phrases or even single words, as in the following sentence: "Children like packaged breakfast foods, such as Wheaties, Cheerios, and Rice Krispies."

'''Extravasation''' is the leakage of [[intravenous]]ly (IV) infused potentially damaging medications into the extravascular tissue around the site of infusion. The leakage can occur through brittle veins in the elderly, through previous [[venipuncture]] access, or through direct leakage from wrongly positioned venous access devices. When the leakage is not of harmful consequence it is known as [[Intravenous therapy#Infiltration/extravasation|infiltration]]. Extravasation of medication during [[intravenous therapy]] is an adverse event related to therapy that, depending on the medication, amount of exposure, and location, can potentially cause serious injury and permanent harm, such as tissue necrosis.  Milder consequences of extravasation include irritation, characterized by symptoms of pain and inflammation, with the clinical signs of warmth, erythema, or tenderness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothrock|first1=Jane C.|title=Alexander's care of the patient in surgery.|date=2015|isbn=9780323089425|edition=15th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medications==
Complications related to extravasation are possible with any medication.
Since Vesicants are blistering agents, extravasation may lead to irreversible tissue injury.

Extravasation is particularly serious during [[chemotherapy]], since chemotherapy medications are highly toxic.

In recent years, healthcare professionals are becoming more aware of this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sauerland C, Engelking C, Wickham R, Corbi D | date = Nov 2006 | title = Vesicant extravasation part I: Mechanisms, pathogenesis, and nursing care to reduce risk | url = | journal = Oncol Nurs Forum | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = 1134–41 | doi=10.1188/06.onf.1134-1141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wickham R, Engelking C, Sauerland C, Corbi D | date = Nov 2006 | title = Vesicant extravasation part II: Evidence-based management and continuing controversies | url = | journal = Oncol Nurs Forum | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = 1143–50 | doi=10.1188/06/onf.1143-1150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goolsby TV, Lombardo FA | date = Feb 2006 | title = Extravasation of chemotherapeutic agents: prevention and treatment | url = | journal = Semin Oncol | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 139–43 | doi=10.1053/j.seminoncol.2005.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ener RA, Meglathery SB, Styler M | date = Jun 2004 | title = Extravasation of systemic hemato-oncological therapies | url = http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/15/6/858 | journal = Ann Oncol | volume = 15 | issue = 6| pages = 858–62 | doi=10.1093/annonc/mdh214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schrijvers DL | year = 2003 | title = Extravasation: a dreaded complication of chemotherapy | url = http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/14/suppl_3/iii26 | journal = Ann Oncol | volume = 14 | issue = Suppl 3| pages = iii26–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatments and techniques==
The best "treatment" of extravasation is ''prevention''.  Depending on the medication that has extravasated, there are potential management options and treatments that aim to minimize damage, although the effectiveness of many of these treatments has not been well studied.&lt;ref name="treatment"&gt;[http://hemonc.org/wiki/Vesicant_%26_irritant_chemotherapy Chemotherapy vesicants, irritants, and treatment for extravasation]&lt;/ref&gt;  In cases of tissue necrosis, surgical debridement and reconstruction may be necessary. The following steps are typically involved in managing extravasation:
*Stop infusion immediately. Put on sterile gloves.
*Replace infusion lead with a disposable syringe. While doing this, do not exert pressure on the extravasation area.
*Slowly aspirate back blood back from the arm, preferably with as much of the infusion solution as possible.
*Remove the original [[cannula]] or other IV access carefully from the arm (removal of the original cannula is not advised by all healthcare institutions, as access to the original cannula by surgeons can be used to help clean extravasated tissue).
*Elevate arm and rest in elevated position. If there are blisters on the arm, aspirate content of blisters with a new thin needle. Warm compresses should be placed initially on the site to help diffuse the contrast medium, and cold compresses are used later to help reduce the swelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shaqdan K ''et al.'' | year = 2014 | title = Incidence of contrast medium extravasation for CT and MRI in a large academic medical centre: A report on 502, 391 injections | doi = 10.1016/j.crad.2014.08.004 | journal = Clinical Radiology | volume =  69| issue = | pages =  1264–1272}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*If, for the extravasated medication, substance-specific measures apply, carry them out (e.g. topical cooling, [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], hyaluronidase or [[dexrazoxane]] may be appropriate).&lt;ref name="treatment" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more information on substance-specific measures, see, for example, the textbook "Extravasation of cytotoxic agents" (Authors: I Mader ''et al.'', Springer Publishing House)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Recent clinical trials have shown that Totect (USA) or Savene (Europe) ([[dexrazoxane]] for extravasation) is effective in preventing the progression of anthracycline extravasation into progressive tissue necrosis. In two open-label, single arm, phase II multicenter clinical trials, necrosis was prevented in 98% of the patients. Dexrazoxane for extravasation is the only registered antidote for extravasation of anthracyclines (daunorubicin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mouridsen HT, Langer SW, Buter J, Eidtmann H, Rosti G, de Wit M, Knoblauch P, Rasmussen A, Dahlstrom K, Jensen PB, Giaccone G | date = Mar 2007 | title = Treatment of anthracycline extravasation with Savene (dexrazoxane): results from two prospective clinical multicentre studies | url = | journal = Ann Oncol | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 546–50 | doi=10.1093/annonc/mdl413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pain management and other measures===
*Pain management and local supportive care is important, as it can help to minimize the additional risk of [[infection]] and [[superinfection]].

==Prevention of extravasation in hospitals==
*Only qualified, chemotherapy-certified nurses who have been trained in venipuncture and administration of medications with vesicant and irritant potential should be allowed to administer vesicants.&lt;ref&gt;Infusion Nurses Society, Infusion Nursing 3rd ed 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
*Choose a large, intact vein with good blood flow for the venipuncture and placement of the cannula. Do not choose inadvertently "dislodgeable" veins (e.g. dorsum of hand or vicinity of joints) if an alternative vein is available.
*The digits, hands, and wrists should be avoided as intravenous sites for vesicant administration because of the close network of tendons and nerves that would be destroyed if an extravasation occurred.
*Place the smallest gauge and shortest length catheter to accommodate the infusion.
*Monitor the venipuncture site closely for evidence of infiltration and instructing patients to report any pain, discomfort, or tightness at the site.
*The IV infusion should be freely flowing. The arm with the infusion should not begin to swell ([[oedema]]), "get red" ([[erythema]]), "get hot" (local temperature increase), and the patient should not notice any irritation or pain on the arm. If this occurs, extravasation management should be initiated.
*The infusion should consist of a suitable carrier solution with an appropriately diluted medicinal/chemotherapy drug inside.
*After the IV infusion has finished, flush the cannula with the appropriate fluid.
*Finally, depending on clinical circumstances, [[central venous catheter|central line access]] may be most appropriate for patients who require repeated administrations of vesicants and irritants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2555">'''Fadl Ashsha'ira''' ({{lang-ar|فضل الشاعرة}}, d. 871 CE) was one of 'three early ‘[[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[qayna|singing girls]] ... particularly famous for their poetry' and is one of the pre-eminent [[medieval Arabic female poets]] whose work survives.&lt;ref&gt;Tahera Qutbuddin, 'Women Poets', in ''Medieval Islamic Civilisation: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Josef W. Meri, 2 vols (New York: Routledge, 2006), II 866, {{cite web |url=http://nelc.uchicago.edu/sites/nelc.uchicago.edu/files/2006%20Women%20Poets%20(Med.%20Islamic.%20Civ.%20Enc.).pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207005116/http://nelc.uchicago.edu/sites/nelc.uchicago.edu/files/2006%20Women%20Poets%20%28Med.%20Islamic.%20Civ.%20Enc.%29.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-07 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Born in [[Yamama]], [[Bahrain]], Fadl was brought up in [[Basra]], [[Iraq]]. Her brothers sold her to a leading officer of the caliphate, and he gave her to Caliph [[Al-Mutawakkil]] (r. 847-61). Fadl became a prominent figure in the court. According to Ibn Annadim, a bibliographer (died 1047), Fadl's ''[[Diwan (poetry)|diwan]]'' extended to twenty pages.&lt;ref&gt;''Classical Poems by Arab Women: A Bilingual Anthology'', ed. and trans. by Abdullah al-Udhari (London: Saqi Books, 1999), p. 132 {{ISBN|086356-047-4}}; books.google.co.uk/books/about/Classical_poems_by_Arab_women.html?id=WniBAAAAIAAJ&amp;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==

An example of Fadl's work, in the translation of [[Abdullah al-Udhari]], is:

:The following poem was written in response to the poet Abu Dulaf (d. 840) who hinted in a poem that she was not a virgin and he preferred virgins, whom he compared to unpierced pearls.

:: Riding beasts are no joy to ride until they're bridled and mounted.
:: So pearls are useless unless they're pierced and threaded.&lt;ref&gt;''Classical Poems by Arab Women: A Bilingual Anthology'', ed. and trans. by Abdullah al-Udhari (London: Saqi Books, 1999), p. 132 {{ISBN|086356-047-4}}; books.google.co.uk/books/about/Classical_poems_by_Arab_women.html?id=WniBAAAAIAAJ&amp;.&lt;/ref&gt;

*On November 19, 2011, during a live taping of [[ESPN]]'s [[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]] at the [[University of Houston]], [[college football]] analyst [[Lee Corso]] said, "Ah, fuck it" before he put on the headwear of [[Shasta (mascot)|Shasta]], the [[Houston Cougars|University of Houston Cougars]]' mascot, demonstrating his prediction that the Cougars would beat the [[SMU Mustangs|Mustangs]] of [[Southern Methodist University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=11/19/11 12:11pm 11/19/11 12:11pm |url=http://deadspin.com/5861123/ah-fuck-it-lee-corso-strikes-again |title='"Ah Fuck It": Lee Corso Strikes Again', Deadspin |publisher=Deadspin.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.chron.com/sportsmedia/2011/11/corso-picks-cougars-with-an-f-bomb-to-boot/ |title="Corso picks Cougars with F-Bomb, then Apologizes", '&amp;#39;Houston Chronicle'&amp;#39; blog |publisher=Blog.chron.com |date=2011-11-19 |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corso's co-hosts [[Kirk Herbstreit]] and [[Chris Fowler]] and their guest speaker [[Carl Lewis]] laughed hysterically in response to his use of the expletive,&lt;ref&gt;[http://deadspin.com/5861123/ah-fuck-it-lee-corso-strikes-again '"Ah Fuck It": Lee Corso Strikes Again'], Deadspin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.chron.com/sportsmedia/2011/11/corso-picks-cougars-with-an-f-bomb-to-boot "Corso picks Cougars with F-Bomb, then Apologizes"] Image capturing co-hosts' reaction, ''Houston Chronicle'' blog&lt;/ref&gt; for which Corso later apologized.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=7254423 "Lee Corso Apologizes", ESPN Video&lt;/ref&gt;
*On December 18, 2011, during a [[CBS]] broadcast of the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] at the [[St. Louis Rams]], St. Louis guard Harvey Dahl protested referee [[Jerome Boger]]'s holding call against him by saying, "I know you didn't just call me for holding. That's not fuckin' holding!" It was heard over the stadium PA system through Boger's open microphone, and aired. CBS commentator [[Dan Dierdorf]] apologized for the slip, and Dahl was assessed a second penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Eu_OY3Lh3M&lt;/ref&gt;
*On November 4, 2012, during the [[Miami Dolphins|Dolphins]]-[[Indianapolis Colts|Colts]] game at [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] in [[Indianapolis]], referee [[Tony Corrente]] loudly said, "God damn it!"

On March 17, 2008, the [[United States Supreme Court]] agreed to [[court hearing|hear]], in September 2008, a case on whether the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) is allowed to regulate the use of fleeting expletives on television broadcasts.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7301244.stm|title=US Court to Rule on TV Expletives|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-03-17|accessdate=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/03/17/fcc.expletives/|title=High Court to Review Penalties for TV Expletives|publisher=CNN|last=Mears|first=Bill|date=2008-03-17|accessdate=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0318/p02s01-usju.html|title=FCC's Obscenity Rule to Get Supreme Court's Ear|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|last=Richey|first=Warren|date=2008-03-18|accessdate=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-na-scotus18mar18,1,6067658.story |title=Supreme Court to Rule on Broadcast Indecency |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Savage |first=David G. |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2008-03-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513120049/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-na-scotus18mar18,1,6067658.story |archivedate=2008-05-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The parties in the case are the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] (supported by other [[television network]]s including [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], and [[NBC]]) and the FCC.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CSM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt; A [[federal appeals court]] had ruled in the favor of the networks; the Supreme Court has agreed to hear the FCC's appeal.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CSM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt;

In a ruling issued April 28, 2009, the United States Supreme Court ruled to uphold the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fleeting expletive rule.&lt;ref name="WSJ.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124091903135863347|title=Court Upholds FCC 'Fleeting Expletive' Rule |work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=2009-04-28|accessdate=2009-04-28 | first=Jess | last=Bravin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court reversed a lower court ruling in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York which found in favor of [[Fox Television]] that the FCC had not properly followed procedures in creating the rule. In the 5-4 ruling by Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], "the court did not definitively settle the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] implications of allowing a federal agency to [[censorship|censor]] broadcasts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/archives/2010/04/05/the-fcc-doesnt-need-to-be The FCC Doesn't Need to Be] by Peter Suderman, ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the court suggested the First Amendment issue should be raised in a [[Federal Appeals Court]].

==U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals==
In a ruling announced July 13, 2010, the [[U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] struck down the FCC indecency policy on fleeting expletives.  Calling it "unconstitutionally vague", the unanimous three judge panel found the policy could infringe upon the constitutionally protected [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] [[freedom of speech]].  According to the panel, the policy "created a chilling effect that goes far beyond the fleeting expletives at issue here", in part due to a lack of guidance on what content is considered offensive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2010/07/13/news/economy/fcc_indecency/?iref=NS1 FCC Indecency Rules Struck Down] by Julianne Pepitone, ''[[CNN Money]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox released a statement stating, "We have always felt that the government's position on fleeting expletives was unconstitutional," and, "While we will continue to strive to eliminate expletives from live broadcasts, the inherent challenges broadcasters face with live television, coupled with the human element required for monitoring, must allow for the unfortunate isolated instances where inappropriate language slips through."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/business/media/14indecent.html?src=busln F.C.C. Indecency Policy Rejected on Appeal] by Edward Wyatt, ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

FCC Chairman [[Julius Genachowski]] indicated the commission will be "reviewing the court's decision in light of our commitment to protect children, empower parents, and uphold the First Amendment."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

==U.S. Supreme Court ruling==
In June 2012, the Supreme Court rescinded several fines issued by the FCC regarding indecent content, including the Fox case stemming from the 2002 ''Billboard'' Music Awards. The court ruled that the FCC's change in enforcement policy to target fleeting instances of profanities and nudity on television was too vague, thus violating their rights to [[Due Process Clause|due process]]. The court did not address the policies themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/business/media/justices-reject-indecency-fines-on-narrow-grounds.html|title=Supreme Court Rejects F.C.C.

'''Grassroots democracy''' is a tendency towards designing [[politics|political]] processes where as much decision-making authority as practical is shifted to the organization's lowest geographic or social level of organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/grassroots-democracy|title=Grassroots-democracy dictionary definition - grassroots-democracy defined|website=Yourdictionary.com|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allwords.com/word-grassroots+democracy.html|title=Definition of grassroots democracy|website=Allwords.com|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grassroots organizations can have a variety of structures; depending on the type of organization and what the members want. These can be non-structured and non-hierarchical organizations that are run by all members, or by whichever member wishes to do something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://next-nexus.info/writing/politics/grassroots%20democracy.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726172735/http://next-nexus.info/writing/politics/grassroots%20democracy.php |archivedate=2015-07-26 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

To cite a specific hypothetical example, a national grassroots organization would place as much decision-making power as possible in the hands of local chapters or common members instead of the head office.  The principle is that for [[democracy|democratic]] power to be best exercised it must be vested in a local community and common members and instead of isolated, atomized individuals, at the top of the organization. [[Grassroots]] organizations can inhabit [[Participatory democracy|participatory systems]].  Grassroots systems differ from [[republic|representative]] systems that allow local communities or national memberships to elect representatives who then go on to make decisions.

The difference between the three systems comes down to where they rest on two different axes:  the rootedness in a community (grassroots versus national or international);  and the ability of all individuals to participate in the shared decision-making process (participatory versus representative.)

Some adherents to a traditional pagan faith (such as the musician [[Gaahl]]) have been known to use the phrase to mock Christians or Christianity, using the similarities between Satan as phallic and passionate and pagan fertility-gods such as [[Freyr]] in this rhetoric as a disambiguation.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== Cultural history ==
The phrase "Hail Satan" is documented as early as 1808, where it is said in the poem ''The Monk of Cambray'' by an evil [[monk]] who uses his pact with Satan to advance in the ranks of the [[Catholic Church]] (and finally become Pope).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colman|first=George|title=Eccentric Tales: In Verse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWc1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA19|year=1812|publisher=T. Tegg and W. Allason|page=19url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWc1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA19|quote= "''Hail, Satan!'' cried he, the Pope I'll be, on my bond I demand thy compliance!"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin version ''Ave Satanas'' (in its variant spelling ''Ave Sathanas''), often appears in literature at least from the 1800s, notably in the popular 1895 [[faust]]ian novel ''[[The Sorrows of Satan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sorrows of Satan|author=[[Marie Corelli|Corelli, Marie]]|year=1895|pages=443|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFjQAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA443|publisher=J.B. Lippincott company|isbn=0-19-283324-3|quote= "—the waves seemed to roar ''Ave Sathanas''!&amp;nbsp;—the wind shrieked it to the thunder,—the lightning wrote it in a snaky line of fire on the darkness, ''Ave Sathanas''!"}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earlier in an 1862 play ''[[St Clement's Day|St. Clement's Eve]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=St. Clement's Eve|author=[[Henry Taylor (dramatist)|Taylor, Henry]]|year=1862|pages=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s80OAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA16|publisher=Chapman and Hall|quote= "...he was seen at midnight in the Rue des Ursulins hanging and whirling round and round the gibbet, whiles the dead bodies, swinging in the wind, sang ''Ave Sathanas!''"}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in reference to satanic undertakings supposed to take place at midnight in a district of Paris). After the phrase "Hail Satan" appeared in the [[1967 in literature|1967]] book ''[[Rosemary's Baby (novel)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' by [[Ira Levin]] and the 1968 [[Rosemary's Baby (film)|film adaptation]] of it, where it is said by Satanists when they believe Satan's will has been accomplished, and had also appeared in other films and in stock footage, the phrase became part of the common conception of what Satanists say.&lt;ref name="Gunn 2005 93–120"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gunn |first=Joshua |year=2005 |title=Prime-time Satanism: rumor-panic and the work of iconic topoi |journal=Visual Communication |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=93–120 |url=http://vcj.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/4/1/93 |accessdate=2008-08-16 |doi=10.1177/1470357205048939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some film actors were reluctant to say it, and of those who did some felt they experienced negative life events afterwards, such as divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Susan|last=Dominus|authorlink=|title=A woman possessed|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/main.jhtml?xml=/fashion/2006/06/04/stjulia04.xml&amp;page=1|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=|date=April 6, 2007|accessdate=2008-08-13 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinciding with its appearance in ''Rosemary's Baby'', the phrase became a common greeting and ritual term in the [[Church of Satan]] (founded in 1966), both in its English form, ''Hail Satan'', as well as in the Latin version of it, ''Ave Satanas''. When ''Ave Satanas'' was used, it was often preceded by the term ''Rege Satanas'' ("Reign, Satan"). (''Rege Satanas'' can be heard in the video of a widely publicized Church of Satan wedding performed by LaVey on February 1, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pwAOSwHuTQ Video of 1967 Church of Satan wedding.]&lt;/ref&gt;) The combination "''Rege Satanas, Ave Satanas, Hail Satan!''" is found as a greeting in early Church of Satan correspondence,&lt;ref&gt;Published in {{cite book |last=Aquino |first=Michael |title=The Church of Satan |year=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in their 1968 recording ''The Satanic Mass'',&lt;ref&gt;LaVey, Anton, ''The Satanic Mass'', LP (Murgenstrumm Records, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately in their 1969 book ''[[The Satanic Bible]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Satanic Bible|last=LaVey|first=Anton|authorlink=Anton LaVey|year=1969|pages=75|url=http://std.kku.ac.th/4830401674/The%20Satanic%20Bible.pdf|isbn=0-380-01539-0|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214195009/http://std.kku.ac.th/4830401674/The%20Satanic%20Bible.pdf|archivedate=2010-02-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same combination also appeared in 1969 in the non-Church of Satan record album by the rock band [[Coven (band)|Coven]], in a 13 minute long "Satanic Mass" of their own.&lt;ref&gt;On the album, ''[[Witchcraft Destroys Minds &amp; Reaps Souls]]'', LP (Dunwich Productions/Mercury Records, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "Hail Satan" by Coven (as well as their use of the [[sign of the horns]] and [[inverted cross]]es on the same album) was the first time this phrase was used in rock music. The phrase is used in some versions of the [[Black Mass]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La Messe Noire|last=Melech|first=Aubrey|year=1985|publisher=Sui Anubis|location=London|isbn=0-947762-03-5|pages=52|url=http://www.templeofbaphomet.com/library/LaMesseNoire.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it often accompanies the phrase "[[shemhamforash]]" and is said at the end of each prayer. This rite was performed by the [[Church of Satan]]&lt;ref name="Barto 1992 86" /&gt;
appearing in the documentary ''[[Satanis]]'' in 1969.&lt;ref name="Gunn 2005 93–120"/&gt; Some [[occultism|occultists]] accompany it with similar addresses to other gods or figures they revere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gods of the Blood |last=Gardell |first=Matthias |publisher=Duke University Press|year=2003|pages=284|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIwwWSSL5JIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Gods+of+the+Blood|isbn=978-0-8223-3071-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rituals involving the phrase tend to be more likely to be mentioned in the press at Halloween.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Silke|last=Tudor |title=Night Crawler|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/1996-11-06/music/night-crawler|format=|work=[[SF Weekly]] |date=November 6, 1996|accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Ave Satani]]", the theme song for ''[[The Omen]]'' (1976), written by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], which won him an [[Academy Award]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeff |last=Berkwits |title=The Omen/The Final Conflict: The Deluxe Editions |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/sound/sfw8018.html |work=[[SciFi.com#SciFi.com|SciFi.com]] |publisher= |date=January 14, 2002 |accessdate=2008-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208194410/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/sound/sfw8018.html |archivedate=February 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has a title which is intended to mean "Hail Satan" in Latin, in opposition to "Ave Christi". (The song contains other Latin phrases inverting Christ, such as "Ave Versus Christi", meaning "Hail Anti-Christ", and "Corpus Satani", an inversion of "Corpus Christi", the body of Christ). The song has been described as hair-raising and has inspired cover versions such as those by [[Fantômas]] or [[Gregorian (band)|Gregorian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Howlett|title=Pick of the day:The Omen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/may/20/tvandradio.television|work=[[guardian.co.uk]]|publisher=|date=May 20, 2003|accessdate=2008-08-13 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music is used in comic portrayals of stock "sinister" characters, for instance in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]", which involves devil-worshiping woodland creatures, a version of the "Ave Satani" is heard in the background when the animals use their demonic powers; also the episode's [[commercial bumper]]s involving a squirrel saying "Hail Satan!" The chant is also parodied in the episode "[[Damien (South Park)|Damien]]", where Damien is accompanied by the chant "Rectus Dominus Cheesy Poofs."

In 1985, the phrase received national news coverage in the United States when [[serial killer]] [[Richard Ramirez]], known as the "Night Stalker", shouted "Hail Satan!" as he was led from the courtroom, while raising his hand with a [[pentagram]] drawn onto it.&lt;ref name="LosAngeles"&gt;{{cite news |first= Robert W.|last= Stewart|authorlink= |title= Ramirez Says He's Innocent--'Hail Satan!' |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/64560749.html?dids=64560749:64560749&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Oct+24%2C+1985&amp;author=ROBERT+W.+STEWART&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Ramirez+Says+He's+Innocent+-%60Hail+Satan!'&amp;pqatl=google|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|page= 1|department= Main News|date= October 24, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/08/us/court-in-los-angeles-gives-night-stalker-death-in-13-killings.html|title=Court in Los Angeles Gives 'Night Stalker' Death in 13 Killings|accessdate=2008-08-13 | work=The New York Times | date=1989-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Ramirez's family denied that he said the phrase, believing that he said "We'll see,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linedecker|first=Clifford L.|title=Night Stalker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=92nuEgXE2rIC&amp;pg=PA200|year=1991|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-92505-5|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; but "Hail Satan" was still being used by journalists over twenty years later as being characteristic of Ramirez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/e/a/1996/09/22/NEWS3710.dtl&amp;type=printable

'''Haim Gaifman''' is a logician, probability theorist, and philosopher of language. He works in [[mathematical logic]] and developed the iterated [[Ultraproduct|ultrapower]] technique in [[set theory]] and models of [[Peano arithmetic]]. Further, he has results in the foundations of probability, defining probabilities on [[First-order logic|first-order]] and on richer languages. He has also worked in [[philosophy of language]], [[philosophy of mathematics]], and [[Theoretical computer science|theoretical computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/haim-gaifman Haim Gaifman], retrieved 2018-04-06&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his studies, he was the research assistant of [[Rudolf Carnap]] and worked on the foundations of probability theory. In 1958 he received his M.Sc. at [[Hebrew University]]. Then in 1962, he received his Ph.D. at [[University of California, Berkeley]] under [[Alfred Tarski]] on the topic of infinite [[Boolean algebra|Boolean algebras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=32667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since, he has held various permanent and visiting positions in mathematics, philosophy and computer science departments.  While he was professor of mathematics at the Hebrew University, he taught courses in philosophy and directed the program in History and Philosophy of Science.

Gaifman currently holds the position of professor emeritus at Hebrew University and a professorship at [[Columbia University]]. His recent interests include foundations of probability, rational choice,  philosophy of mathematics, logical systems that formalize aspects of natural reasoning, Frege and theories of naming.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23394">'''Indexed grammars''' are a generalization of [[context-free grammars]] in that [[nonterminal]]s are equipped with lists of ''flags'', or ''index symbols''.
The language produced by an indexed grammar is called an '''[[indexed language]]'''.

==Definition==

===Modern definition by Hopcroft and Ullman===

&lt;!---supplemented from talk page # Definition by Hopcroft+Ullman 1979---&gt;
In contemporary publications following Hopcroft and Ullman (1979),
{{refn|Hopcroft and Ullman (1979),&lt;ref name=Hopcroft_and_Ullman&gt;{{cite book | last = [[John Hopcroft|Hopcroft]] | first = John E. | author2 = [[Jeffrey D. Ullman]] | title = [[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation]] | year = 1979 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | isbn = 0-201-02988-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sect.14.3, p.389-390. This section is omitted in the 2nd edition 2003.}}
an indexed grammar is formally defined a 5-tuple ''G'' = ⟨''N'',''T'',''F'',''P'',''S''⟩ where

* ''N'' is a set of variables or [[Nonterminal|nonterminal symbols]],
* ''T'' is a set ("[[alphabet (formal languages)|alphabet]]") of terminal symbols,
* ''F'' is a set of so-called ''index symbols'', or ''indices'',
* ''S'' ∈ ''N'' is the ''[[start symbol (formal languages)|start symbol]]'', and
* ''P'' is a finite set of ''[[Production (formal languages)|productions]]''.

In productions as well as in derivations of indexed grammars, a string ("stack") ''σ'' ∈ ''F''[[Kleene star|&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;]] of index symbols is attached to every nonterminal symbol ''A'' ∈ ''N'', denoted by ''A''[''σ''].&lt;ref group=note&gt;"[" and "]" are meta symbols to indicate the stack.&lt;/ref&gt;
Terminal symbols may not be followed by index stacks.
For an index stack ''σ'' ∈ ''F''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and a string ''α'' ∈ (''N'' ∪ ''T'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; of nonterminal and terminal symbols, ''α''[''σ''] denotes the result of attaching [''σ''] to every nonterminal in ''α''; for example if ''α'' equals {{math|''a'' ''B'' ''C'' ''d'' ''E''}} with ''a'',''d'' ∈ ''T'' terminal, and {{math|''B'',''C'',''E'' ∈ ''N''}} nonterminal symbols, then ''α''[''σ''] denotes {{math|''a'' ''B''[''σ''] ''C''[''σ''] ''d'' ''E''[''σ''].}}
Using this notation, each production in ''P'' has to be of the form

# ''A''[σ] → α[σ],
# ''A''[σ] → ''B''[''f''σ], or
# ''A''[''f''σ] → α[σ],

where ''A'', ''B'' ∈ ''N'' are nonterminal symbols, ''f'' ∈ ''F'' is an index, ''σ'' ∈ ''F''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is a string of index symbols, and ''α'' ∈ (''N'' ∪ ''T'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is a string of nonterminal and terminal symbols. Some authors write ".." instead of "''σ''" for the index stack in production rules; the rule of type 1, 2, and 3 then reads {{math|''A''[..]→''α''[..], &amp;nbsp; ''A''[..]→''B''[''f''..]}}, and {{math|''A''[''f''..]→''α''[..]}}, respectively.

Derivations are similar to those in a [[context-free grammar#Rule application|context-free grammar]] except for the index stack attached to each nonterminal symbol.
When a production like e.g. ''A''[''σ''] → ''B''[''σ'']''C''[''σ''] is applied, the index stack of ''A'' is copied to both ''B'' and ''C''.
Moreover, a rule can push an index symbol onto the stack, or pop its "topmost" (i.e., leftmost) index symbol.

Formally, the relation ⇒ ("direct derivation") is defined on the set (''N''[''F''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;]∪''T'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; of "sentential forms" as follows:
#If ''A''[''σ''] → ''α''[''σ''] is a production of type 1, then β ''A''[''φ''] ''γ'' ⇒ ''β'' ''α''[''φ''] ''γ'', using the above definition. That is, the rule's left hand side's index stack ''φ'' is copied to each nonterminal of the right hand side.
#If ''A''[''σ''] → ''B''[''fσ''] is a production of type 2, then ''β'' ''A''[''φ''] ''γ'' ⇒ ''β'' ''B''[''fφ''] ''γ''. That is, the right hand side's index stack is obtained from the left hand side's stack ''φ'' by pushing ''f'' onto it.
#If ''A''[''fσ''] → ''α''[''σ''] is a production of type 3, then ''β'' ''A''[''fφ''] ''γ'' ⇒ ''β'' ''α''[''φ''] ''γ'', using again the definition of ''α''[''σ'']. That is, the first index ''f'' is popped from the left hand side's stack, which is then distributed to each nonterminal of the right hand side.

As usual, the derivation relation {{overset|[[reflexive transitive closure|&amp;lowast;]]|⇒}} is defined as the [[reflexive transitive closure]] of direct derivation ⇒.
The language ''L''(''G'') = { ''w'' ∈ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;: ''S''  {{overset|&amp;lowast;|⇒}} ''w'' } is the set of all strings of terminal symbols derivable from the start symbol.

&lt;!---now contained in the informal description of the derivation relation and the note about meta symbols---&gt;

===Original definition by Aho===

&lt;!---former section "Definition"---&gt;
Historically, indexed grammar were introduced by [[Alfred Aho]] (1968)&lt;ref name="aho1968"&gt;{{cite journal | last = [[Alfred Aho|Aho]] | first = Alfred | year = 1968 | title = Indexed grammars—an extension of context-free grammars | journal = [[Journal of the ACM]] | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 647–671 | url = http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=321488&amp;type=pdf&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE,&amp;CFID=17841194&amp;CFTOKEN=70113868 | doi = 10.1145/321479.321488 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using a different formalism.
Aho defined an indexed grammar to be a 5-tuple (''N'',''T'',''F'',''P'',''S'') where
# ''N'' is a finite [[alphabet]] of variables or [[Nonterminal|nonterminal symbols]]
# ''T'' is a finite alphabet of terminal symbols
# ''F'' ⊆ [[power set|2]]&lt;sup&gt;''N'' × (''N'' ∪ ''T'')[[Kleene star|&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; is the finite set of so-called ''flags'' (each flag is itself a set of so-called ''index productions'')
# ''P'' ⊆ ''N'' × (''NF''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ∪ ''T'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is the finite set of ''[[Production (computer science)|productions]]''
# ''S'' ∈ ''N'' is the ''start symbol''

Direct derivations were as follows:

* A production ''p'' = (''A'' → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''η''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;…''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;''η''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) from ''P'' matches a nonterminal ''A'' ∈ ''N'' followed by its (possibly empty) string of flags ''ζ'' ∈ ''F''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. In context, ''γ'' ''Aζ'' ''δ'', via ''p'', derives to ''γ'' ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;…''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ''δ'', where ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''η''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''ζ'' if ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; was a nonterminal and the empty word otherwise. The old flags of ''A'' are therefore ''copied'' to each new nonterminal produced by ''p''. Each such production can be simulated by appropriate productions of type 1 and 2 in the Hopcroft/Ullman formalism. 
* An index production ''p'' = (''A'' → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;…''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∈ ''f'' matches ''Afζ'' (the flag ''f'' it comes from must match the first symbol following the nonterminal ''A'') and copies the remaining index string ''ζ'' to each new nonterminal: ''γ'' ''Afζ'' ''δ'' derives to ''γ'' ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;…''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ''δ'', where ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the empty word when ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a terminal and ''ζ'' when it is a nonterminal. Each such production corresponds to a production of type 3 in the Hopcroft/Ullman formalism.

This formalism is e.g. used by Hayashi (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;65-66).&lt;ref name="Hayashi.1973"&gt;{{cite journal| author=T. Hayashi| title=On Derivation Trees of Indexed Grammars - An Extension of the ''uvxyz'' Theorem| journal=Publication of the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences| year=1973| volume=9| number=1| pages=61–92| institution=Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences| url=http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/show_pdf.php?issn=0034-5318&amp;vol=9&amp;iss=1&amp;rank=3| doi=10.2977/prims/1195192738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

&lt;!---former section "Example"---&gt;
In practice, stacks of indices can count and remember what rules were applied and in which order. For example, indexed grammars can describe the context-sensitive language of word triples { ''www'' : ''w'' ∈ {''a'',''b''}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; }:

:{|
|-
| ''S''[''σ''] || → || ''S''[''fσ'']
| ''T''[''fσ''] || → || ''a'' ''T''[''σ'']
|-
| ''S''[''σ''] || → || ''S''[''gσ'']
| ''T''[''gσ''] || → || ''b'' ''T''[''σ'']
|-
| ''S''[''σ''] || → || ''T''[''σ''] ''T''[''σ''] ''T''[''σ''] &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 
| ''T''[] || → || ''ε''
|}

A derivation of ''{{not a typo|abbabbabb}}'' is then

:{{math|size=100%|''S''[]}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''S''[''g'']}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''S''[''gg'']}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''S''[''fgg'']}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''T''[''fgg''] ''T''[''fgg''] ''T''[''fgg'']}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''a'' ''T''[''gg''] ''T''[''fgg''] ''T''[''fgg'']}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''ab'' ''T''[''g''] ''T''[''fgg''] ''T''[''fgg'']}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''abb'' ''T''[] ''T''[''fgg''] ''T''[''fgg'']}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''abb'' ''T''[''fgg''] ''T''[''fgg'']}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|...}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''abb'' ''abb'' ''T''[''fgg'']}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|...}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''abb'' ''abb'' ''abb''}}.

&lt;!---supplemented from talk page # Example by Hopcroft+Ullman 1979---&gt;
As another example, the grammar ''G'' = ⟨ {''S'',''T'',''A'',''B'',''C''}, {''a'',''b'',''c''}, {''f'',''g''}, ''P'', ''S'' ⟩ produces the language { ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;: ''n'' ≥ 1 }, where the production set ''P'' consists of
:{|
|-
| ''S''[''σ''] → ''T''[''gσ''] || ''A''[''fσ''] → ''a'' ''A''[''σ''] || ''A''[''gσ''] → ''a''
|-
| ''T''[''σ''] → ''T''[''fσ''] || ''B''[''fσ''] → ''b'' ''B''[''σ''] || ''B''[''gσ''] → ''b''
|-
| ''T''[''σ''] → ''A''[''σ''] ''B''[''σ''] ''C''[''σ''] &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; || ''C''[''fσ''] → ''c'' ''C''[''σ''] &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; || ''C''[''gσ''] → ''c''
|}
An example derivation is
:{{math|size=100%|''S''[]}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''T''[''g'']}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''T''[''fg'']}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''A''[''fg''] ''B''[''fg''] ''C''[''fg'']}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''aA''[''g''] ''B''[''fg''] ''C''[''fg'']}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''aA''[''g''] ''bB''[''g''] ''C''[''fg'']}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''aA''[''g''] ''bB''[''g''] ''cC''[''g'']}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''aa'' ''bB''[''g''] ''cC''[''g'']}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''aa'' ''bb'' ''cC''[''g'']}} ⇒ {{math|size=100%|''aa'' ''bb'' ''cc''}}.

Both example languages are [[Pumping lemma for context-free languages#Usage of the lemma|known]] to be not context-free.

==Properties==

[[John Hopcroft|Hopcroft]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman|Ullman]] tend to consider indexed languages as a "natural" class, since they are generated by several formalisms other than indexed grammars, viz.{{refn|Hopcroft and Ullman (1979),&lt;ref name=Hopcroft_and_Ullman/&gt; Bibliographic notes, p.394-395}}

==Linear indexed grammars==

[[Gerald Gazdar]] has defined a second class, the '''linear indexed grammars''' ('''LIG'''),{{refn|According to Staudacher (1993, p.361 left, Sect.2.2),&lt;ref name="staudacher1993"/&gt; the name "linear indexed grammars" wasn't used in Gazdar's 1988 paper, but appeared later, e.g. in Weir and Joshi (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David J. Weir |author2=Aravind K. Joshi | chapter=Combinatory Categorial Grammars: Generative Power and Relationship to Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems| title=Proc. 26th Meeting Assoc. Comput. Ling.| year=1988| pages=278–285| url=http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/P/P88/P88-1034.pdf?origin=publication_detail}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} by requiring that at most one nonterminal in each production be specified as receiving the stack,&lt;ref group=note&gt;all other nonterminals receive an empty stack&lt;/ref&gt;
whereas in an ordinary indexed grammar, all nonterminals receive copies of the stack. 
Formally, a linear indexed grammar is defined similar to an ordinary indexed grammar, but the production's form requirements are modified to:

# ''A''[''σ''] → ''α''[] ''B''[''σ''] ''β''[],
# ''A''[''σ''] → ''α''[] ''B''[''fσ''] ''β''[],
# ''A''[''fσ''] → ''α''[] ''B''[''σ''] ''β''[],

where ''A'', ''B'', ''f'', ''σ'', ''α'' are used as [[#Modern definition by Hopcroft and Ullman|above]], and ''β'' ∈ (''N'' ∪ ''T'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is a string of nonterminal and terminal symbols like ''α''.&lt;ref group=note name="Gazdars def"&gt;In order to generate any string at all, some productions must be admitted having no nonterminal symbol on their right hand side. However, Gazdar didn't discuss this issue.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the direct derivation relation ⇒ is defined similar to above. This new class of grammars defines a strictly smaller class of languages,&lt;ref name="gazdar1998"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Applicability of Indexed Grammars to Natural Languages | year=1988 | last=Gazdar | first=Gerald | title=Natural Language Parsing and Linguistic Theories | editor=U. Reyle and C. Rohrer | pages=69–94 | publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company | isbn=1-55608-055-7 | series=Studies in linguistics and philosophy |volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
which belongs to the [[mildly context-sensitive language|mildly context-sensitive]] classes.

The language { ''www'' : ''w'' ∈ {''a'',''b''}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; } is generable by an indexed grammar, but not by a linear indexed grammar, while both { ''ww'' : ''w'' ∈ {''a'',''b''}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; } and { ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ''c''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; : n ≥ 1 } are generable by a linear indexed grammar.

If both the original and the modified production rules are admitted, the language class remains the indexed languages.&lt;ref&gt;Gazdar (1988), Appendix, p.89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===

Letting σ denote an arbitrary collection of stack symbols, we can define a grammar for the language ''L'' = {''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ''c''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; | ''n'' ≥ 1 }{{refn|Cf. the properly indexed grammar for the same language given [[#Examples|above]]. The last rule, viz. ''T''[]→ε, of the linear indexed grammar doesn't conform to Gazdar's definition in a strict sense, cf. &lt;ref group=note name="Gazdars def"/&gt;|group=note}} as

:{|
|-
| ''S''[''σ''] || → || ''a S''[''fσ''] ''c''
|-
| ''S''[''σ''] || → || ''T''[''σ'']
|-
| ''T''[''fσ''] || → || ''T''[''σ''] ''b''
|-
| ''T''[] || → || ''ε''
|}

To derive the string ''abc'' we have the steps ''S''[] ⇒ ''aS''[''f'']''c'' ⇒ ''aT''[''f'']''c'' ⇒ ''aT''[]''bc'' ⇒ ''abc''.

Similarly: ''S''[] ⇒ ''aS''[''f'']''c'' ⇒ ''aaS''[''ff'']''cc'' ⇒ ''aaT''[''ff'']''cc'' ⇒ ''aaT''[''f'']''bcc'' ⇒ ''aaT''[]''bbcc'' ⇒ ''aabbcc''.

===Computational power===

The linearly indexed languages are a subset of the indexed languages, and thus all LIGs can be recoded as IGs, making the LIGs strictly less powerful than the IGs. A conversion from a LIG to an IG is relatively simple.&lt;ref&gt;Gazdar 1988, Appendix, p.89-91&lt;/ref&gt; LIG rules in general look approximately like &lt;math&gt;X[\sigma] \to \alpha Y[\sigma] \beta&lt;/math&gt;, modulo the push/pop part of a rewrite rule. The symbols &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; represent strings of terminal and/or non-terminal symbols, and any non-terminal symbol in either must have an empty stack, by the definition of a LIG. This is, of course, counter to how IGs are defined: in an IG, the non-terminals whose stacks are not being pushed to or popped from must have exactly the same stack as the rewritten non-terminal. Thus, somehow, we need to have non-terminals in &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; which, despite having non-empty stacks, behave as if they had empty stacks.

Let's consider the rule &lt;math&gt;X[\sigma] \to Y[] Z[\sigma f]&lt;/math&gt; as an example case. In converting this to an IG, the replacement for &lt;math&gt;Y[]&lt;/math&gt; must be some &lt;math&gt;Y^{\prime}[\sigma]&lt;/math&gt; that behaves exactly like &lt;math&gt;Y[]&lt;/math&gt; regardless of what &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is. To achieve this, we can simply have a pair of rules that takes any &lt;math&gt;Y^{\prime}[\sigma]&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is not empty, and pops symbols from the stack. Then, when the stack is empty, it can be rewritten as &lt;math&gt;Y[]&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;Y^{\prime}[\sigma f] \to Y^{\prime}[\sigma]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;Y^{\prime}[] \to Y[]&lt;/math&gt;
We can apply this in general to derive an IG from an LIG. So for example if the LIG for the language &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^n c^n d^m | n \geq 1, m \geq 1\}&lt;/math&gt; is as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;S[\sigma] \to T[\sigma]V[]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;V[] \to d ~|~ dV[]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;T[\sigma] \to aT[\sigma f]c ~|~ U[\sigma]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;U[\sigma f] \to bU[\sigma]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;U[] \to \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
The sentential rule here is not an IG rule, but using the above conversion algorithm, we can define new rules for &lt;math&gt;V^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;, changing the grammar to:

: &lt;math&gt;S[\sigma] \to T[\sigma]V^{\prime}[\sigma]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;V^{\prime}[\sigma f] \to V^{\prime}[\sigma]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;V^{\prime}[] \to V[]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;V[] \to d ~|~ dV[]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;T[\sigma] \to aT[\sigma f]c ~|~ U[\sigma]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;U[\sigma f] \to bU[\sigma]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;U[] \to \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
Each rule now fits the definition of an IG, in which all the non-terminals in the right hand side of a rewrite rule receive a copy of the rewritten symbol's stack. The indexed grammars are therefore able to describe all the languages that linearly indexed grammars can describe.

===Relation to other formalism===

Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994)&lt;ref name="vijayshankarAndWeir1995"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vijay-Shanker, K. |author2=Weir, David J. 1994. |title=The Equivalence of Four Extensions of Context-Free Grammars |journal=Mathematical Systems Theory |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=511–546 |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.52.4044&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |doi=10.1007/bf01191624}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates that Linear Indexed Grammars, [[Combinatory categorial grammar|Combinatory Categorial Grammars]], [[Tree-adjoining grammar|Tree-adjoining Grammars]], and [[Head grammar|Head Grammars]] all define the same class of string languages.
Their formal definition of linear indexed grammars&lt;ref&gt;p.517-518&lt;/ref&gt; differs from the [[#Linear indexed grammars|above]].{{clarify|date=August 2014}}

LIGs (and their [[Equivalence (formal languages)|weakly equivalents]]) are strictly less expressive (meaning they generate a proper subset) than the languages generated by another family of weakly equivalent formalism, which include: [[LCFRS]], [[MCTAG]], [[MCFG]] and [[minimalist grammar]]s (MGs). The latter family can (also) be parsed in [[polynomial time]].&lt;ref name="BenthemMeulen2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Johan F.A.K. van Benthem|author2=Alice ter Meulen|title=Handbook of Logic and Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7yJLmZCbFUC&amp;pg=PA404|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-53727-0|page=404|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distributed index grammars==
Another form of indexed grammars, introduced by Staudacher (1993),&lt;ref name="staudacher1993"&gt;{{citation |author=Staudacher, Peter |year=1993 |title=New frontiers beyond context-freeness: DI-grammars (DIGs) and DI-automata. |booktitle=Sixth Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL '93) |url=http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/E/E93/E93-1042.pdf |pages=358–367 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719224223/http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/E/E93/E93-1042.pdf |archivedate=2006-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the class of Distributed Index grammars (DIGs). What distinguishes DIGs from Aho's Indexed Grammars is the propagation of indexes. Unlike Aho's IGs, which distribute the whole symbol stack to all non-terminals during a rewrite operation, DIGs divide the stack into substacks and distributes the substacks to selected non-terminals.

The general rule schema for a binarily distributing rule of DIG is the form

: ''X''[''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;...''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] → ''α'' ''Y''[f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;] ''β'' ''Z''[''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;...''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] γ
Where α, β, and γ are arbitrary terminal strings. For a ternarily distributing string:

: ''X''[''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;...''f''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sub&gt;...''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] → ''α'' ''Y''[f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;] ''β'' ''Z''[''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;...''f''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;] ''γ'' ''W''[''f''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sub&gt;...''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] ''η''
And so forth for higher numbers of non-terminals in the right hand side of the rewrite rule. In general, if there are ''m'' non-terminals in the right hand side of a rewrite rule, the stack is partitioned ''m'' ways and distributed amongst the new non-terminals. Notice that there is a special case where a partition is empty, which effectively makes the rule a LIG rule. The Distributed Index languages are therefore a superset of the Linearly Indexed languages.

{{see also|Hebrew literature}}
'''Israeli literature''' is [[literature]] written in the [[State of Israel]] by [[Israelis]]. Most works classed as Israeli literature are written in the [[Hebrew language]], although some Israeli authors  write in [[Yiddish]], [[English language|English]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. 
==History==
===Hebrew writers===
The foundations of modern Israel writing were laid by a group of literary pioneers from the [[Second Aliyah]] including [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]], the only Nobel Prize winner for literature in Hebrew and the only one for Israeli literature, [[Moshe Smilansky]], [[Yosef Haim Brenner]], [[David Shimoni]], and [[Jacob Fichman]]. Until World War I, Hebrew literature was centered in Eastern Europe. After the war and the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] many Hebrew writers found their way to Palestine, so that at the time Palestinian writing was essentially a continuation of the European tradition. In 1921, 70 writers met in Tel Aviv and founded the Hebrew Writers' Association. About this time the first literary periodicals made their appearance—''Ha-Adamah'', edited by Brenner, and ''Ma'abarot'', edited by Fichman. The 1920 and 1930s witnessed the emergence of Palestine as the dominant center of Hebrew literary activity. Many of the pioneers of Hebrew literature were Zionists, and eventually made their way to Palestine. The great figures of the early part of the century—[[Bialik]], [[Ahad Ha-Am]], [[Shaul Tchernichovsky|Tchernichovsky]]—all spent their last years in Tel Aviv, and although this was not the period of their greatest creativity, they exerted a great influence on younger Hebrew writers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/literature/FinalEdit_Literature_TO_HebrewLit.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

Among the earliest modern Hebrew writers was a small minority of writers who were born in Palestine.  This cadre includes [[Yitzhaq Shami]] &lt;!-- ([[:he:יצחק שמי]])--&gt; and [[Yehuda Burla]] &lt;!-- ([[:he:יהודה בורלא]])--&gt;, Sepharadi Jews whose families migrated to Palestine in the 19th and 18th centuries, respectively.  The writing of this group stands out for its authentic depiction of the Arab and Jewish population of Palestine, told from the vantage point of those who grew up in its midst.

The most important writers of the first generation, S.Y. Agnon and [[Haim Hazaz]], were deeply rooted in their European background, and served as links between the classical writers of the early decades of the [[Revival of the Hebrew language|Hebrew revival]] and the Hebrew writers in Palestine during the following generations.

For the next generation of writers, the center of focus was Palestine, even when they were writing about other parts of the world. Their framework was the period of [[aliyah]] and, very often, life in the [[kibbutz]]. Among the outstanding names are [[Uri Zvi Greenberg]] and [[Avraham Shlonsky]], who found in Palestine the antidote to the rootlessness of the Diaspora.

The third generation of writers emerged around the time of the [[Israeli war of independence]]. Its key figures ([[S. Yizhar]], [[Moshe Shamir]], [[Hanoch Bartov]], [[Haim Gouri]], [[Benjamin Tammuz]], [[Aharon Megged]]) were all [[Sabra (person)|sabras]] or had been brought to the country at an early age. Strong influences now came in from other countries, especially Western. A group called the "[[Canaanites (movement)|Canaanites]]" even sought to deny the connection between Israelis and Jews elsewhere. But after 1948, a feeling of emptiness and of searching for new values was leading to experiments in exploring the Jewish past. 

The subsequent generation of the 1960s ([[A. B. Yehoshua]], [[Amos Oz]], [[Natan Yonatan]],  [[Yoram Kaniuk]], [[Yaakov Shabtai]]) has endeavoured to place [[Israeli culture]] within a world context and stresses not so much the unique aspects of Jewish life and Israel as the universal. This school of writers often identifies itself with the protest literature of other countries.

The following generation, writers who were born in the 1960s and 1970s and made their debut in the 1980s and 1990s, examined the basic questions of Jewish-Israeli existence by exposing the collective tensions in individual characters and fates.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]], vol. 9, p. 1001-1002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yiddish writers===
Apart from Hebrew writers, there is considerable creative productivity in Israel in other languages, notably in Yiddish. Before World War II, Warsaw, Moscow, and New York were the main centers of Yiddish activity. In Palestine there was still a certain hostility to the Yiddish language, which was felt as a challenge to the Hebrew revival. However, with World War II the whole picture changed. The European centers were liquidated by Hitler and Stalin, and the New York center declined. Immigration brought many of the leading Yiddish writers to Israel. Here the internal attitude relaxed and became friendly, in view of the Holocaust in Europe, on the one hand, and the secure position attained by Hebrew, on the other. 

Yiddish writing in Israel can be marked by generations, similar to those in Hebrew literature. The first consisted of writers such as [[David Pinski]] and [[Sholem Asch]], who passed their last years in Israel. The second generation, led by [[Abraham Sutzkever]], started its career in Eastern Europe but continued in Israel. The third generation was centered on "Young Israel", a [[Modernism|modernist]] group of poets and prose writers, most of whom are kibbutz members, whose work has been influenced by the avant-garde schools of [[English literature|English]] and [[French literature|French writing]].

Yiddish writing in Israel is concentrated on the European Holocaust (the leading writer on this is [[Ka-Tzetnik]]), and life among new immigrants. Yiddish authors in Israel are organized in a Yiddish authors' association.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]], vol. 9, p. 1003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic writers===
The presence of Arabic-language literature in [[Israelis|Israeli]] society can be initially attributed to [[Emile Habibi]], an Israeli-Palestinian writer and a communist politician. In 1992, he was awarded the [[Israel Prize]] for Arabic literature. A fervent communist, Habibi helped created the [[Maki (historical political party)|Israeli Communist Party]] and established ''Al-Ittihad'', a communist daily [[Arabic language]] newspaper published in [[Haifa]]. Habibi's works, while often a critique of [[Israelis|Israeli]] society, are nevertheless part of [[Israeli culture]].

==Publication of books in Israel==
By law, the [[Jewish National and University Library]] of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] receives two copies of each book published in Israel. In 2004 it reported that it received 6,436 new books. Most of them were published in Hebrew, and 89% those books published in Hebrew were original to the Hebrew language. Almost 8% of the 2004 crop were children's books and another 4% were textbooks. According to the type of publisher, the books were 55% commercial, 14% self-published, 10% governmental, 7% educational, and 14% published by other types of organizations. The orthodox and ultra-orthodox sector was responsible for 21% of the total titles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hunews.huji.ac.il/articles.asp?cat=3&amp;artID=455 Hebrew University of Jerusalem news] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322204249/http://www.hunews.huji.ac.il/articles.asp?cat=3&amp;artID=455 |date=2008-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2017 figures show that 17% of books were Torah-related, 16% were literature and 14% children's books.&lt;ref&gt;Tal Polon: [http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/246986 Israeli books: More Torah-related books than any other type] Arutz 7,

In 1987, Hashmi successfully predicted the [[Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan|Russian troops]] retreat from [[Afghanistan]] and [[Indo-American relations|warming of the Indo-U.S. relations]] at the expense of Pakistan.{{rp|339}}&lt;ref name="Sager Publication, Hashmi, 2005" /&gt; He reportedly disagreed with the Pakistan's policy on the [[Soviet Union]], and called for strengthening relations with [[Russia]].{{rp|3340}}&lt;ref name="Sager Publication, Hashmi, 2005" /&gt;

In his book, ''I'm a Rebel'', Hasmi is of the view towards the [[National conservatism|national conservatism]] and wrote a critical view on the performance [[Martial law in Pakistan|military governments in Pakistan]] which have harmed the solidarity of his country and over dependence towards the [[United States]] for the political support for their regimes— in desperate for political legitimacy without public approvals, (military) presidents often desperately negotiate with India without formal agenda to seek peace in the region.{{rp|152}}&lt;ref name="Sager Publication, Hashmi, 2005" /&gt; After learning the news of the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]] in [[New York City|New York]] in 2001, Hashmi successfully calculated of imprisonment of PML(N)'s leadership and Musharraf's providing [[NATO logistics in the Afghan War|military bases]] to the [[United States]] [[US invasion of Afghanistan|invasion]] of [[Afghanistan]], and calculated precisely of [[India and state-sponsored terrorism|Indian support]] for [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|terrorist organizations]] in the [[War in North-West Pakistan|Western Pakistan]].{{rp|170-171}}&lt;ref name="Sager Publication, Hashmi, 2005" /&gt; While he sided and agreed with Prime Minister Sharif's policy on India, Hashmi demanded a investigative commission against Chairman joint chiefs Gen. [[Pervez Musharraf]] over the [[Kargil War|Kargil debacle]] and the [[Musharraf Coup|self-coup staged by the latter]] and gave strong criticism to the Lt-Gen.

In [[philately]] a '''killer''' is a particularly heavy type of [[handstamp]], or portion of one, consisting of heavy bars, cork impressions or other crude devices used to cancel [[postage stamps]].&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;Bennett, Russell and Watson, James; ''Philatelic Terms Illustrated'', Stanley Gibbons Publications, London (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Such handstamps may also be known as ''obliterators'' as the mark applied often obscures almost the whole of the stamp.

Killers were often used in the early days of stamps as the postal authorities wished to ensure that stamps could not be re-used.

In the United States this is also the name for a particular circular date stamp with four thick horizontal bars to the right. This handstamp effectively cancels the stamp while leaving the place and date information easily visible. The bars are known as ''killer bars''.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Douglas &amp; Mary. ''The Hodder Stamp Dictionary'', Hodder &amp; Stoughton, London, 1973, p.126. {{ISBN|0-340-17183-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no exact definition of what is, and is not, a killer cancel and the term is often used to apply to any heavy cancellation.

The '''Kwasio''' language, also known as '''Ngumba / Mvumbo''', '''Bujeba''', and '''Gyele / Kola''', is a language of [[Cameroon]], spoken in the south along the coast and at the border with [[Equatorial Guinea]] by some 70 000{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} members of the [[Ngumba people|Ngumba]], [[Kwasio people|Kwasio]], [[Gyele people|Gyele]] and [[Mabi people|Mabi]] peoples.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Many authors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le bajeli.

In the Ethnologue, the languages therefore receive different codes: Kwasio has the ISO 639-3 code ''nmg'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/nmg|title=Ethnologue: Kwasio|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=March 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Gyele has the code ''gyi.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/gyi|title=Ethnologue: Gyele|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=March 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kwasio, Ngumba, and Mabi are village farmers; the [[Gyele people|Gyele]] (also known as the Kola or Koya) are nomadic Pygmy [[hunter-gatherer]]s living in the rain forest.

Dialects are Kwasio (also known as Kwassio, Bisio), Mvumbo (also known as Ngumba, Ngoumba, Mgoumba, Mekuk), and Mabi (Mabea). The Gyele speak the subdialects of Mvumbo, Gyele in the north and Kola also known as Koya in the south, variously spelled ''Giele, Gieli, Gyeli, Bagiele, Bagyele, Bajele, Bajeli, Bogyel, Bogyeli, Bondjiel'' and
''Likoya, Bako, Bakola, Bakuele'', also ''Bekoe''. The local derogatory term for pygmies, ''Babinga,'' is also used.  ''Glottolog'' adds [[Shiwa language|Shiwa]].

Kwasio is a [[tonal language]]. As a [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] language, it has [[noun class|noun class system]]. The Kwasio noun class system is somewhat reduced, having retained only 6 genders (a gender being a pairing of a singular and a plural noun class).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17268">The '''language of mathematics''' is the system used by [[mathematician]]s to communicate [[Mathematics|mathematical]] ideas among themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/language/MathIsLanguage.shtml|title=Mathematics Is a Language|last=Bogomolny|first=Alexander |author-link=Alexander Bogomolny|website=www.cut-the-knot.org|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This language consists of a [[substratum (linguistics)|substrate]] of some [[natural language]] (for example [[English language|English]]) using [[technical term]]s and grammatical conventions that are peculiar to mathematical discourse (see [[Mathematical jargon]]), supplemented by a highly specialized symbolic notation for [[mathematical formula]]s.

Like natural languages in general, discourse using the language of mathematics can employ a scala of [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]]s. [[Research article]]s in [[academic journals]] are sources for detailed theoretical discussions about ideas concerning mathematics and its implications for society.

==What is a language?==
Here are some definitions of [[language]]:
* ''a systematic means of communicating by the use of sounds or conventional symbols''
* ''a system of words used in a particular discipline''
* ''a system of abstract codes which represent antecedent events and concepts''&lt;ref&gt;Syntax: An Introduction, Volume 1
Talmy GivónJohn Benjamins Publishing, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''the code we all use to express ourselves and communicate to others'' - Speech &amp; Language Therapy Glossary of Terms
* ''a set (finite or infinite) of sentences, each finite in length and constructed out of a finite set of elements'' - [[Noam Chomsky]].

These definitions describe language in terms of the following components:
* A [[vocabulary]] of symbols or words
* A [[grammar]] consisting of rules of how these symbols may be used
* A 'syntax' or propositional structure, which places the symbols in linear structures.
* A 'Discourse' or 'narrative,' consisting of strings of syntactic propositions&lt;ref&gt;Syntax: An Introduction, Volume 1
Talmy Givón
John Benjamins Publishing, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[community]] of people who use and understand these symbols
* A range of [[Meaning (semiotics)|meanings]] that can be communicated with these symbols

Each of these components is also found in the language of mathematics.

==The vocabulary of mathematics==
[[Mathematical notation]] has assimilated [[table of mathematical symbols|symbols]] from many different [[alphabet]]s and [[typeface]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/logic#toc283520|title=logic|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes symbols that are specific to mathematics, such as

:&lt;math&gt;\forall \ \exists \ \vee \ \wedge \ \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Mathematical notation is central to the power of modern mathematics. Though the [[algebra]] of [[Al-Khwārizmī]] did not use such symbols, it solved equations using many more rules than are used today with symbolic notation, and had great difficulty working with multiple variables (which using symbolic notation can simply be called &lt;math&gt;x, y, z&lt;/math&gt;, etc.). Sometimes formulas cannot be understood without a written or spoken explanation, but often they are sufficient by themselves, and sometimes they are difficult to read aloud or information is lost in the translation to words, as when several parenthetical factors are involved or when a complex structure like a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is manipulated.

Like any other profession, mathematics also has its own brand of [[technical terminology]]. In some cases, a word in general usage has a different and specific meaning within mathematics—examples are [[group (mathematics)|group]], [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], [[field (mathematics)|field]], [[category theory|category]], [[term (mathematics)|term]], and [[Factorization|factor]]. For more examples, see [[:Category:Mathematical terminology]].

In other cases, specialist terms have been created which do not exist outside of mathematics—examples are [[tensor]], [[fractal]], [[functor]]. Mathematical statements have their own moderately complex taxonomy, being divided into [[axiom]]s, [[conjecture]]s, [[theorem]]s, [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]]s and [[corollary|corollaries]]. And there are stock phrases in mathematics, used with specific meanings, such as "{{italics correction|''[[if and only if]]''}}", "{{italics correction|''[[necessary and sufficient]]''}}" and "''[[without loss of generality]]''". Such phrases are known as [[mathematical jargon]].

The vocabulary of mathematics also has visual elements. Diagrams are used informally on blackboards, as well as more formally in published work. When used appropriately, diagrams display schematic information more easily. Diagrams also help visually and aid intuitive calculations. Sometimes, as in a [[visual proof]], a diagram even serves as complete justification for a proposition. A system of diagram conventions may evolve into a mathematical notation – for example, the [[Penrose graphical notation]] for tensor products.

==The grammar of mathematics==
The mathematical notation used for formulas has its own [[grammar]], not dependent on a specific natural language, but shared internationally by mathematicians regardless of their mother tongues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/GeneralIntro/FormalandNaturalLanguages.html|title=1.11. Formal and Natural Languages — How to Think like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition|website=interactivepython.org|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the conventions that the formulas are written predominantly [[left to right]], even when the writing system of the substrate language is right-to-left, and that the [[Latin alphabet]] is commonly used for simple [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s and [[parameter]]s. A formula such as
:&lt;math&gt;\sin x + a\cos 2 x \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
is understood by Chinese and Syrian mathematicians alike.

Such mathematical formulas can be a [[part of speech]] in a natural-language phrase, or even assume the role of a full-fledged sentence. For example, the formula above, an [[inequation]], can be considered a sentence or an independent clause in which the [[greater than or equal to]] symbol has the role of a symbolic [[verb]]. In careful speech, this can be made clear by pronouncing "≥" as "is greater than or equal to", but in an informal context mathematicians may shorten this to "greater or equal" and yet handle this grammatically like a verb. A good example is the book title ''Why does {{nowrap|1=E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}?'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why does E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;? (and why should we care?) |author=Brian Cox |authorlink=Brian Cox (physicist) |author2=Jeff Forshaw |authorlink2=Jeff Forshaw|publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-306-81876-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; here, the [[equals sign]] has the role of an [[infinitive]].

Mathematical formulas can be ''[[Speech production|vocalized]]'' (spoken aloud). The vocalization system for formulas has to be learned, and is dependent on the underlying natural language. For example, when using English, the expression "''ƒ''(''x'')" is conventionally pronounced "eff of eks", where the insertion of the preposition "of" is not suggested by the notation per se. The expression "&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;", on the other hand, is commonly vocalized like "dee-why-dee-eks", with complete omission of the [[fraction bar]], in other contexts often pronounced "over". The book title ''Why does {{nowrap|1=E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}?'' is said aloud as ''Why does ee equal em see-squared?''.

Characteristic for mathematical discourse – both formal and informal – is the use of the [[Clusivity|inclusive]] [[Grammatical person|first person]] [[plural]] "we" to mean: "the audience (or reader) together with the speaker (or author)".

=== Typographical conventions ===
{{Main|Typographical conventions in mathematical formulae}}
As is the case for spoken mathematical language, in written or printed mathematical discourse, mathematical expressions containing a symbolic verb, like &lt;math&gt;=,\ \in,\ \exists&lt;/math&gt;, are generally treated as clauses (dependent or independent) in sentences or as complete sentences and are punctuated as such by mathematicians and theoretical physicists.  In particular, this is true for ''both'' inline and displayed expressions.  In contrast, writers in other natural sciences disciplines may try to avoid using equations within sentences and may treat displayed expressions in the same way as figures or schemes.

As an example, a mathematician might write: 

:If &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(b_n)&lt;/math&gt; are convergent sequences of real numbers, and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n=A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} b_n=B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(c_n)&lt;/math&gt;, defined for all positive integers &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;c_n = a_n+b_n&lt;/math&gt;, is convergent, and
::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} c_n=A+B&lt;/math&gt;.

In this statement, "&lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt;" (in which &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is read as "ay en" or perhaps, more formally, as "the sequence ay en") and "&lt;math&gt;(b_n)&lt;/math&gt;" are treated as nouns, while "&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n=A&lt;/math&gt;" (read: the limit of &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; as ''n'' tends to infinity equals 'big A'), "&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} b_n=B&lt;/math&gt;", and "&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} c_n=A+B&lt;/math&gt;" are read as independent clauses, and "&lt;math&gt;c_n = a_n+b_n&lt;/math&gt;" is read as "the equation &lt;math&gt;c_n&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; plus &lt;math&gt;b_n&lt;/math&gt;".  Moreover, the sentence ends after the displayed equation, as indicated by the [[period  (punctuation)|period ]] after "&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} c_n=A+B&lt;/math&gt;". In terms of typesetting conventions, broadly speaking, standard mathematical functions such as {{math|[[Sine|sin]]}} and operations such as {{math|+}} as well as punctuation symbols including the various [[bracket]]s are set in {{math|[[roman type]]}} while Latin alphabet variables are set in {{math|''[[italics]]''}}.  Matrices, vectors, and other objects made up of components are set in {{math|'''bold roman'''}}.  (There is some disagreement as to whether the standard constants (e.g., {{mvar|e}}, π, i = (–1)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;) or the "d" in {{math|''dy''/''dx''}} should be italicized.  Greek letters are also usually set upright instead of slanted.)  There are also a number of conventions for the part of the alphabet from which variable names are chosen.  For example, {{mvar|i}}, {{mvar|j}}, {{mvar|k}}, {{mvar|l}}, {{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|n}} are usually reserved for integers, {{mvar|w}} and {{mvar|z}} are often used for complex numbers, while {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}, α, β, γ are used for real numbers.  The letters {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, {{mvar|z}} are frequently used for [[unknown (mathematics)|unknown]]s to be found or as arguments of a function, while {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}} are used for [[coefficient]]s and {{mvar|f}}, {{mvar|g}}, {{mvar|h}} are used as names of functions.  These conventions are not hard rules.

Definitions are signaled by words like "we call", "we say", or "we mean" or by statements like "An [''object''] is [''word to be defined''] if [''condition'']" (for example, "A set is closed if it contains all of its limit points.").  As a special convention, the word "if" in such a definition should be interpreted as "[[if and only if]]".

[[Theorems]] have generally a title or label in bold type, and possibly identify the originator (for example, "{{math|'''Theorem 1.4 (Weyl).'''}}").  This is immediately followed by the statement of the theorem, usually set in italics.  The proof of a theorem is usually clearly delimited, starting with the word ''Proof'' while the end of the proof is indicated by a [[Tombstone (typography)|halmos]] or another symbol, or by the letters [[Q.E.D.]].

==The language community of mathematics==
Mathematics is used by [[list of mathematicians|mathematicians]], who form a global community composed of speakers of many languages. It is also used by students of mathematics.  As mathematics is a part of primary education in almost all countries, almost all educated people have some exposure to pure mathematics. There are very few cultural dependencies or barriers in modern mathematics. There are international mathematics competitions, such as the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]], and international co-operation between professional mathematicians is commonplace.

==The meanings of mathematics==
Mathematics is used to communicate information about a wide range of different subjects. Here are three broad categories:

* '''Mathematics describes the real world''': many areas of mathematics originated with attempts to describe and solve real world phenomena - from measuring farms ([[geometry]]) to falling apples ([[calculus]]) to gambling ([[probability]]). Mathematics is widely used in modern [[mathematical physics|physics]] and [[engineering]], and has been hugely successful in helping us to understand more about the universe around us from its largest scales ([[physical cosmology]]) to its smallest ([[quantum mechanics]]). Indeed, the very success of mathematics in this respect has been a source of puzzlement for some philosophers (see [[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]] by [[Eugene Wigner]]).
* '''Mathematics describes abstract structures''': on the other hand, there are areas of pure mathematics which deal with [[abstract structure]]s, which have no known physical counterparts at all. However, it is difficult to give any categorical examples here, as even the most abstract structures can be co-opted as models in some branch of physics (see [[Calabi-Yau spaces]] and [[string theory]]).
* '''Mathematics describes mathematics''': mathematics can be used reflexively to describe itself—this is an area of mathematics called [[metamathematics]].

Mathematics can communicate a range of meanings that is as wide as (although different from) that of a natural language. As [[England|English]] mathematician [[Rolph Ludwig Edward Schwarzenberger|R.L.E. Schwarzenberger]] says:

:''My own attitude, which I share with many of my colleagues, is simply that mathematics is a language. Like English, or Latin, or Chinese, there are certain concepts for which mathematics is particularly well suited: it would be as foolish to attempt to write a love poem in the language of mathematics as to prove the [[Fundamental Theorem of Algebra]] using the English language.''

==Alternative views==
Some definitions of language, such as early versions of [[Charles Hockett]]'s "design features" definition, emphasize the spoken nature of language. Mathematics would not qualify as a language under these definitions, as it is primarily a written form of communication (to see why, try reading [[Maxwell's equations]] out loud). However, these definitions would also disqualify [[sign language]]s, which are now recognized as languages in their own right, independent of spoken language.

Other linguists believe no valid comparison can be made between mathematics and language, because they are simply too different:

: ''Mathematics would appear to be both more and less than a language for while being limited in its linguistic capabilities it also seems to involve a form of thinking that has something in common with art and music.'' - Ford &amp; Peat (1988)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10087">A '''linguistic universal''' is a pattern that occurs systematically across [[natural language]]s, potentially true for all of them. For example, ''All languages have [[noun]]s and [[verbs]]'', or ''If a language is spoken, it has [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s.'' Research in this area of [[linguistics]] is closely tied to the study of [[linguistic typology]], and intends to reveal generalizations across languages, likely tied to [[cognition]], [[perception]],  or other abilities of the mind. The field was largely pioneered by the linguist [[Joseph Greenberg]], who derived a set of [[Greenberg's linguistic universals|forty-five basic universals]], mostly dealing with [[syntax]], from a study of some thirty languages.

==Terminology==
Linguists distinguish between two kinds of universals: '''absolute''' (opposite: '''statistical''', often called '''tendencies''') and '''implicational''' (opposite '''non-implicational'''). Absolute universals apply to every known language and are quite few in number; an example is ''All languages have [[pronoun]]s''. An implicational universal applies to languages with a particular feature that is always accompanied by another feature, such as ''If a language has [[trial grammatical number]], it also has [[dual grammatical number]]'', while non-implicational universals just state the existence (or non-existence) of one particular feature.

Also in contrast to absolute universals are '''tendencies''', statements that may not be true for all languages but nevertheless are far too common to be the result of chance.&lt;ref&gt;Dryer (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; They also have implicational and non-implicational forms. An example of the latter would be ''The vast majority of languages have [[nasal consonant]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lushootseed language|Lushootseed]] and [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]] are examples of the rare languages which truly lack nasal consonants as normal speech sounds.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most tendencies, like their universal counterparts, are implicational. For example, ''With overwhelmingly greater-than-chance frequency, languages with normal [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] order are [[postposition]]al''. Strictly speaking, a tendency is not a kind of universal, but exceptions to most statements called universals can be found. For example, [[Latin]] is an SOV language with [[preposition]]s. Often it turns out that these exceptional languages are undergoing a shift from one type of language to another. In the case of Latin, its descendant [[Romance languages]] switched to [[subject–verb–object|SVO]], which is a much more common order among prepositional languages.

Universals may also be '''bidirectional''' or '''unidirectional'''. In a bidirectional universal two features each imply the existence of each other. For example, languages with [[postposition]]s usually have SOV order, and likewise SOV languages usually have postpositions. The implication works both ways, and thus the universal is bidirectional. By contrast, in a unidirectional universal the implication works only one way. Languages that place [[relative clause]]s before the noun they modify again usually have SOV order, so pre-nominal relative clauses imply SOV. On the other hand, SOV languages worldwide show little preference for pre-nominal relative clauses, and thus SOV implies little about the order of relative clauses. As the implication works only one way, the proposed universal is a unidirectional one.

Linguistic universals in syntax are sometimes held up as evidence for [[universal grammar]] (although [[epistemology|epistemological]] arguments are more common). Other explanations for linguistic universals have been proposed, for example, that linguistic universals tend to be properties of language that aid communication. If a language were to lack one of these properties, it has been argued, it would probably soon evolve into a language having that property.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel everett: Language the cultural tool&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Halliday]] has argued for a distinction between '''descriptive''' and '''theoretical'''  categories in resolving the matter of the existence of linguistic universals, a distinction he takes from [[J.R. Firth]] and [[Louis Hjelmslev]]. He argues that "theoretical categories, and their inter-relations construe an abstract model of language...; they are interlocking and mutually defining". Descriptive categories, by contrast, are those set up to describe particular languages. He argues that "When people ask about 'universals', they usually mean descriptive categories that are assumed to be found in all languages. The problem is there is no mechanism for deciding how much alike descriptive categories from different languages have to be before they are said to be 'the same thing'"&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2002. A personal perspective. In On Grammar, Volume 1 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum p12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantics==
In [[semantics]], research into linguistic universals has taken place in a number of ways. Some linguists, starting with [[Gottfried Leibniz]], have pursued the search for a hypothetic irreducible semantic core of all languages. A modern variant of this approach can be found in the [[natural semantic metalanguage]] of [[Anna Wierzbicka]] and associates.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Goddard &amp; Wierzbicka (1994) and Goddard (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Other lines of research suggest cross-linguistic tendencies to use body part terms metaphorically as [[adposition]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Heine (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; or tendencies to have morphologically simple words for cognitively salient concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Rosch et al. (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; The human body, being a physiological universal, provides an ideal domain for research into semantic and lexical universals. In a seminal study, Cecil H. Brown (1976) proposed a number of universals in the semantics of body part terminology, including the following: in any language, there will be distinct terms for &lt;small&gt;BODY&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;HEAD&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;ARM&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;EYES&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;NOSE&lt;/small&gt;, and &lt;small&gt;MOUTH&lt;/small&gt;; if there is a distinct term for &lt;small&gt;FOOT&lt;/small&gt;, there will be a distinct term for &lt;small&gt;HAND&lt;/small&gt;; similarly, if there are terms for &lt;small&gt;INDIVIDUAL TOES&lt;/small&gt;, then there are terms for &lt;small&gt;INDIVIDUAL FINGERS&lt;/small&gt;. Subsequent research has shown that most of these features have to be considered cross-linguistic tendencies rather than true universals. Several languages like [[Tidore language|Tidore]] and [[Kuuk Thaayorre language|Kuuk Thaayorre]] lack a general term meaning 'body'. On the basis of such data it has been argued that the highest level in the [[partonomy]] of body part terms would be the word for 'person'.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins (1993), Enfield et al. 2006:17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mansukhlal Maganlal Jhaveri''' (1907–1981) was a [[Gujarati language]] poet, critic, and literary historian of Gandhian era. He was deeply interested in classical Sanskrit poetry&lt;ref name="NatarajanNelson1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nalini Natarajan|author2=Emmanuel Sampath Nelson|title=Handbook of Twentieth-century Literatures of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lTnv6o-d_oC&amp;pg=PA115|accessdate=9 December 2017|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-28778-7|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also the author of ''History of Gujarati Literature'' (1978).

==Biography==
Mansukhlal Jhaveri was born on October 3, 1907 in [[Jamnagar]]. He completed his primary and secondary education in Jamnagar and matriculated in 1931. He acquired a Bachelor of Arts in 1935 and a Master of Arts in 1937 from Shamaldas College, [[Bhavnagar]]. He subsequently taught at Raiya College in [[Mumbai]], Dharmendrasinhji College in Rajkot from 1940 to 1945 and [[St. Xavier's College, Mumbai|St. Xavier's College]] in Mumbai from 1945 to 1958. From 1958 to 1963, he served as principal of Madhwani Arts and Commerce College, [[Porbandar]]. In 1966, he started to teach at Mumbai again but soon after became a principal at BEC College, Kolkata. He died on August 27, 1981, in Mumbai.&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web | title=મનસુખલાલ ઝવેરી, ગુજરાતી સાહિત્ય પરિષદ | website=Gujarati Sahitya Parishad | url=http://www.gujaratisahityaparishad.com/prakashan/photo-gallery/sahitya-sarjako/Mansukhlal-Zaveri.html | language=gu | access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Hasmukhgauri{{when|date=January 2018}} and had four daughters and a son.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The Maryland-based psychotherapist and author Anita Gadhia-Smith is his granddaughter.&lt;ref name="Gadhia-Smith2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Anita Gadhia-Smith|title=From Addiction to Recovery: A Therapist's Personal Journey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQvmEbJYcS8C&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=18 January 2018|date=6 April 2011|publisher=iUniverse|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-1-4620-0529-1|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He had several pen-names such as '''Devaki Ayodhya''', '''Punarvasu''', '''Madilant''', '''Samintiyajak,''' and '''Siddhartha'''.&lt;ref name=Topiwala/&gt;

He published his first poetry collection in 1929, ''Chandradut,'' which is an adaptation of ''[[Meghadūta]]'' by [[Kālidāsa]], written in ''Mandakranta'' meter. His other poetry collections are ''Phooldol'' (1933), ''Aaradhana'' (1939), ''Abhisar'' (1947), ''Anubhuti'' (1956) and ''Doomo Ogalyo'' (1975), which contain rhythmic poems about love, nature and God.&lt;ref name="NatarajanNelson1996"/&gt; Deeply influenced by classical Sanskrit poetry, he also wrote poems on mythological themes such as ''Abhimanyu'' and ''Ashwatthama''.&lt;ref name="Das1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sisir Kumar Das|authorlink=Sisir Kumar Das|title=History of Indian Literature: 1911-1956, struggle for freedom : triumph and tragedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sqBjpV9OzcsC&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=9 December 2017|year=1991|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-7201-798-9|pages=139 &amp; 623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Topiwala&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Topiwala |first=Chandrakant |author-link=Chandrakant Topiwala |title=Jhaveri Mansukhlal Maganlal |encyclopedia=Gujarati Sahitya Kosh (Encyclopedia of Gujarati Literature) |year=1990 |publisher=[[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]] |volume=2 |location=Ahmedabad |pages=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Encyclopedia of Indian Literature, he was a critic of the first order in the poet-critic tradition of Gujarati literature.&lt;ref name="Datta1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amaresh Datta|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: A-Devo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&amp;pg=PA188|accessdate=9 December 2017|year=1987|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-260-1803-1|page=188 &amp; 786}}&lt;/ref&gt; He deeply studied Eastern and Western concepts of literary criticism.&lt;ref name="NatarajanNelson1996"/&gt; He published several books of critical articles and reviews including ''Thoda Vivechan Lekho'' (1944), ''Paryeshana'' (1952), ''Kavyavimarsha'' (1962), ''Abhigam'' (1966), ''Govardhanram'' (1967), ''Nhanalal'' (1967), ''Kanaiylal Munshi'' (1970), ''Umashankar Joshi'' (1971), ''Gujarati Sahityabhasha'' (1972), ''Balwantrai Thakor'' (1976), ''Aapno Kavita Vaibhav'' Vol. 1-2 (1974-1975), ''Drishtikon'' (1978), ''Gandhiyug Nu Sahitya'' (1978) and ''Umashankar Joshi - Natyakar'' (1979). In ''Aapno Kavita Vaibhav'', he presented an anthology of Gujarati poetry from 1850 to 1973.&lt;ref name=Topiwala/&gt;

He wrote ''History of Gujarati Literature'' (1978), in English. In collaboration with other writers, he wrote a history of Gujarati literature in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]: ''Gujarati Sahityanu Rekhadarshan'' (1953).&lt;ref name=Topiwala/&gt;

Some of his works, including ''Gujarati Bhasha: Vyakaran ane Lekhan'' (1946), ''Bhasha Parichay'' Part 1 to 4 (1951 to 1957) and ''Vakapriththakaran ane Suddhalekhan'' (1965), are based on Gujarati grammar and language. ''Dashamskandha'' (1942), ''Mari Shrestha Vartao'' (1952), ''Navi Kavita'' (1952; with others), ''Gujarati Tunki Varta'' (1960), ''Dayaram'' (1960) and ''Aapna Urmikavyo'' (1976) are the compilations he edited.&lt;ref name=Topiwala/&gt;

He translated Kalidasa's ''Abhijnanshakuntalam'' as ''Smritibramsha athva Shapit Shakuntala'' (1928) into Gujarati. He also translated [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]'' into Gujarati from English.&lt;ref name="Das1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Topiwala/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5471">In mathematics and computer science, a '''morphic word''' or '''substitutive word''' is an infinite sequence of symbols which is constructed from a particular class of [[endomorphism]] of a [[free monoid]].

Every [[automatic sequence]] is morphic.&lt;ref name=LotIII524/&gt;

==Definition==
Let ''f'' be an endomorphism of the free monoid ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; on an alphabet ''A'' with the property that there is a letter ''a'' such that ''f''(''a'') = ''as'' for a non-empty string ''s'': we say that ''f'' is '''prolongable''' at ''a''.  The word

:&lt;math&gt; a s f(s) f(f(s)) \cdots f^{(n)}(s) \cdots \ &lt;/math&gt;

is a '''pure morphic''' or '''pure substitutive word'''.  Note that it is the limit of the sequence ''a'', ''f''(''a''), ''f''(''f''(''a'')), ''f''(''f''(''f''(''a''))), ...
It is clearly a fixed point of the endomorphism ''f'': the unique such sequence beginning with the letter ''a''.&lt;ref name=LotII10&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hon505&gt;Honkala (2010) p.505&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, a morphic word is the image of a pure morphic word under a coding.&lt;ref name=LotIII524/&gt;

If a morphic word is constructed as the fixed point of a prolongable ''k''-[[uniform morphism]] on ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; then the word is ''k''-[[automatic sequence|automatic]].  The ''n''-th term in such a sequence can be produced by a [[finite state automaton]] reading the digits of ''n'' in base ''k''.&lt;ref name=LotIII524/&gt;

==Examples==
* The [[Thue–Morse sequence]] is generated over {0,1} by the 2-uniform endomorphism 0 → 01, 1 → 10.&lt;ref name=LotII11&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LotIII525&gt;Lothaire (2005) p.525&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Fibonacci word]]  is generated over {''a'',''b''} by the endomorphism ''a'' → ''ab'', ''b'' → ''a''.&lt;ref name=LotIII524&gt;Lothaire (2005) p.524&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LotII11/&gt;
* The [[tribonacci word]] is generated over {''a'',''b'',''c''} by the endomorphism ''a'' → ''ab'', ''b'' → ''ac'', ''c'' → ''a''.&lt;ref name=LotIII525/&gt;
* The [[Rudin–Shapiro sequence]] is obtained from the fixed point of the 2-uniform morphism ''a'' → ''ab'', ''b'' → ''ac'', ''c'' → ''db'', ''d'' → ''dc''  followed by the coding ''a'',''b'' → 0, ''c'',''d'' → 1.&lt;ref name=LotIII525/&gt;
* The [[regular paperfolding sequence]] is obtained from the fixed point of the 2-uniform morphism ''a'' → ''ab'', ''b'' → ''cb'', ''c'' → ''ad'', ''d'' → ''cd''  followed by the coding ''a'',''b'' → 0, ''c'',''d'' → 1.&lt;ref name=LotIII526&gt;Lothaire (2005) p.526&lt;/ref&gt;

==D0L system==
A '''D0L system''' (deterministic context-free [[Lindenmayer system]]) is given by a word ''w'' of the free monoid ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; on an alphabet ''A'' together with a morphism σ prolongable at ''w''.  The system generates the infinite D0L word ω = lim&lt;sub&gt;''n''→∞&lt;/sub&gt; σ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''w'').  Purely morphic words are D0L words but not conversely.  However, if ω = ''u''ν is an infinite D0L word with an initial segment ''u'' of length |''u''| ≥ |''w''|, then ''z''ν is a purely morphic word, where ''z'' is a letter not in ''A''.&lt;ref name=Hon506&gt;Honkala (2010) p.506&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Merkava Muzzle Flash.jpg|250px|thumb|Muzzle flash of an [[Israel]]i [[Merkava]] IIId Baz tank [[IMI 120 mm gun]]]]
[[File:Uss iowa bb-61 pr.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[USS Iowa (BB-61)]] fires a full broadside during a target exercise near [[Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques Island, Puerto Rico]], 1 July 1984, showing the muzzle blast from its [[Armament of the Iowa-class battleship|16 inch main battery]] and the blast's effect on the water surrounding the ship.]]
'''Muzzle flash''' is the [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] of a '''muzzle blast''', which expels high-temperature, high-pressure [[gas]]es from the [[Muzzle (firearm)|muzzle]] of a [[firearm]].  The blast and flash are caused by the combustion products of the [[gunpowder]], and any remaining unburned powder, mixing with the ambient air. The size and shape of the muzzle flash is dependent on the type of [[ammunition]] being used and the individual characteristics of firearm and any devices attached to the muzzle (such as a [[muzzle brake]] or [[flash suppressor]]).

==Muzzle blast==
The muzzle blast is the explosive expansion of propellant gases when the [[gun barrel|barrel]] seal previously maintained by the projectile is suddenly removed as the said projectile leaves the muzzle.  The blast is often broken down into two components, an auditory component&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcaudio.com/decibel.htm Muzzle Blast Sound Intensity, Firearm Sound Pressure Level]&lt;/ref&gt; and a non-auditory component.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA335572  Blast Overpressure Studies. Nonauditory Damage Risk Assessment for Simulated Muzzle Blast from a l2Omm Ml2l Mortar System.] (abstract)&lt;/ref&gt;  The auditory component, the sound of the gunshot, is important because it can cause hearing loss or give away the gun's position, while the non-auditory component, the overpressure wave, can cause damage to nearby items.

[[File:Live Fire.jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers covering their ears while firing a 120-mm mortar]]

===Sound===
The sound of a gunshot, also known as the '''muzzle report''', may have two sources: the muzzle blast itself, and any [[shockwave]] produced by a [[transonic]] or [[supersonic]] projectile. [[Suppressor]]s help to reduce the muzzle report of firearms by providing a larger area for the propellant gas to expand, decelerate and cool before release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midwayusa.com/guntecdictionary.exe/showterm?TermID=4604 |publisher=MidwayUSA |title=Definition for "sound suppressor"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overpressure wave===
The [[overpressure]] wave from the muzzle blast of a firearm can contain a significant amount of energy because it travels at an extremely high velocity. Residual pressures at the muzzle can be a significant fraction of the peak chamber pressure, especially when slow burning powders or short barrels are used. This energy can also be harnessed by a [[muzzle brake]] to reduce the recoil of the firearm, or by a [[muzzle booster]] to provide energy to operate the [[firearm actions|action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midwayusa.com/guntecdictionary.exe/showterm?TermID=1860 |publisher=MidwayUSA |title=Definition for "compensator"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems caused by muzzle blast===
Muzzle blasts can easily exceed sound pressure levels of 140 [[decibel]]s, which can cause permanent hearing loss even with brief and infrequent exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earplugco.com/hearing.htm Hearing protection FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628050036/http://www.earplugco.com/hearing.htm |date=2007-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With big guns such as artillery, that danger can extend outwards a significant distance from the muzzle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA005274  Prediction of Standoff Distances to Prevent Loss of Hearing from Muzzle Blast]&lt;/ref&gt;

The force of the muzzle blast can cause damage to items near the muzzle, and with artillery, the energy is sufficiently large to cause severe damage to surrounding structures and vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA198199  Muzzle Blast Damage to Combat Vehicles] (abstract)&lt;/ref&gt; It furthermore can violently raise dust and debris when firing rifles from prone position and so give away the position. Preventive actions may consist in wetting dry ground or covering the area around the muzzle with a tarpaulin.

==Muzzle flash==
[[File:Muend1.jpg|thumb|right|Muzzle flash of a [[revolver]]. Note the minor flash at the gap between cylinder and barrel.]]
The muzzle flash refers to the light emitted by the muzzle blast, both [[visible light]] and [[infrared]].  Both heat and pressure can result in light being emitted.

===Muzzle flash characteristics===
Muzzle flash can be broken down into five distinct components.&lt;ref&gt;Tony DiGiulian, [http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/tech-090.htm Muzzle flash], 14 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Muzzle glow'' is a reddish glow that is visible before the [[bullet]] leaves the [[Gun barrel|barrel]]. Muzzle glow is created by superheated gases that have leaked past the projectile and have exited the barrel.
*The ''primary flash'' is caused by propellant gases exiting the firearm behind the bullet. Although amongst the brightest of the flashes, the heat of the primary flash dissipates quickly and thus is no longer visible.
*The ''intermediate flash'' is caused by [[shock wave]]s created by the high speeds of the escaping gases and projectile, and appears as a reddish disc shape in front of the muzzle.
*The ''secondary flash'' appears farthest from the muzzle as a large white or yellow flame. Secondary flash is caused by the reaction of incompletely combusted ejecta mixing with abundant [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere surrounding the muzzle.&lt;ref&gt;G. Klingenberg, [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/109618037/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0#search=%22%22Intermediate%20Flash%22%20firearms%22 Gun Muzzle Blast and Flash], 21 July 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
*Following the dissipation of the muzzle flash, partially unburnt powder or other heated materials can be ejected from the muzzle and appear as residual ''[[Ember|sparks]]''.

===Suppression===
Muzzle flash, particularly the long duration secondary flash, is an inherent problem in most firearms. Due to its [[brightness]], muzzle flash can temporarily blind the shooter, or give away the shooter's location, especially at night.  Ingestion of the muzzle flash from aircraft mounted guns has also been implicated in [[compressor stall]] and [[flameout]], causing loss of aircraft.&lt;ref name=1986pat&gt;{{cite patent | country = WO | number = 1986/001796A1 | status = application | title = Gun Flash Suppressants | pubdate = 1986-09-24  | inventor = Winkler, David Allen | class = C06B 23/00, 31/28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flash suppressor]]s attempt to suppress the flash mechanically, by interfering with the shock wave using either a cone or a series of slots at the muzzle of the firearm. However, since the primary cause of the secondary flash is combustion of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]], chemical approaches are also used. In [[World War I]], bags of [[sodium chloride]] (table salt) were placed in front of the propellant charges of artillery to suppress the flash.  Addition of a few percent of [[alkali]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s to the powder for flash suppression is common, typically salts of [[potassium]] such as [[potassium chloride]], [[potassium sulfate]], [[potassium carbonate]], and [[potassium bicarbonate]]. In both cases, the salts act as [[catalyst]]s, and interfere with the hydrogen-oxygen combustion to reduce the muzzle flash.  The side effects of the alkali salts is a reduction in power, an increase in smoke, and fouling and corrosion of the firearm and nearby equipment (a significant concern with aircraft guns). [[Ammonium chloride]] and [[ammonium nitrate]] salts have also been tried with success.&lt;ref name=1986pat /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Explosives, 6th Ed. |isbn=978-3-527-31656-4 |others=Josef Köhler  (trans.)|authors=Rudolf Meyer, Josef Köhler, Axel Homburg |publisher= Wiley-VCH |year=2007|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection, with muzzle blast==
[[Gunfire locator]]s detect muzzle blast with microphones and triangulate the location where the shots were fired. They are commercially available, and have been installed in many high-crime areas of large cities.  They provide a fairly precise location of the source of a shot fired outdoors&amp;mdash;99% to within {{convert|33|ft|m}} or better&amp;mdash;and can provide it to police within seconds of a firing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/179274.pdf |title=Random Gunfire Problems and Gunshot Detection Systems |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |date=December, 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muzzle flashes create distinct signatures that can be located using [[infrared]] imaging technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5686889.html  Infrared sniper detection enhancement]&lt;/ref&gt; Technology is being developed to detect enemy muzzle flashes before the projectile reaches its target.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3659">'''Narcissistic neurosis''' is a term introduced by [[Sigmund Freud]] to distinguish the class of [[neurosis|neuroses]] characterised by their lack of [[object relations theory|object relations]] and their fixation upon the early stage of libidinal [[narcissism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 471-2&lt;/ref&gt; The term is less current in contemporary psychoanalysis,&lt;ref&gt;J. Laplanche/J-B Pontalis, ''The Language of Psychoanalysis'' (2012) p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; but still a focus for analytic controversy.&lt;ref&gt;J-M Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (2005) p. 132-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud considered such neurosis as impervious to psychoanalytic treatment, as opposed to the [[transference neurosis]] where an emotional connection to the analyst was by contrast possible.&lt;ref&gt;''Introductory Lectures'' p. 473 and p. 499&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud's changing ideas==
Freud originally applied the term "narcissistic neurosis" to a range of disorders, including perversion, depression, and [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Quinodoz, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, however, he came to single out "illnesses which are based on a conflict between the ego and the [[super-ego]]... we would set aside the name of 'narcissistic psycho-neuroses' for disorders of that kind"&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;—[[melancholia]] being the outstanding example.

About the same time, in the wake of the work of [[Karl Abraham]], he began to modify to a degree his view on the inaccessibility of narcissistic neurosis to analytic treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; However his late lectures from the thirties confirmed his opinion of the unsuitability of narcissistic and psychotic conditions for treatment "to a greater or less extent";&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; as did his posthumous 'Outline of Psychoanalysis'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 447&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==
From the twenties onwards, Freud's views of the inaccessibility of the narcissistic neuroses to analytic influence had been challenged, first by [[Melanie Klein]],&lt;ref&gt;Quinodoz, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; and then by object relations theorists more broadly.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (1993) p. xi-ii&lt;/ref&gt;

While classical analysts like [[Robert Waelder]] would maintain Freud's delimiting standpoint into the sixties, eventually even within [[ego psychology]] challenges to the 'off-limits' view of what were increasingly seen as [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline disorders]] emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (1988) p. 129-32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Relational psychoanalysis]], like [[Heinz Kohut]], would also take a more positive approach to narcissistic neurosis, emphasising the need for a partial or initial participation in the narcissistic illusions.&lt;ref&gt;G. Mascialino, ''A Critical Appraisal of Relational Approaches to Psychoanalysis'' (2008) p. 56-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In retrospect, Freud's caution may be seen as a result of his unwillingeness to work with the [[negative transference]], unlike the post-Kleinians.&lt;ref&gt;Quinodoz, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nisga’a''' (also '''Nass''', '''Nisgha''', '''Nisg̱a’a''', '''Nishka''', '''Niska''', '''Nishga''', '''Nisqa’a''') is a [[Tsimshianic]] language of the [[Nisga'a]] people of northwestern [[British Columbia]]. Nisga'a people, however, dislike the term ''Tshimshianic'' as they feel that it gives precedence to [[Tsimshian|Coast Tsimshian]]. Nisga’a is very closely related to [[Gitxsan language|Gitxsan]]. Indeed, many linguists regard Nisga’a and Gitksan as dialects of a single Nass–Gitksan language. The two are generally treated as distinct languages out of deference to the political separation of the two groups.

== History and usage ==

Anglican missionary [[James Benjamin McCullagh]] conducted much early linguistic work in Nisga’a, preparing translations of parts of the Bible and [[Book of Common Prayer]] published in 1890, as well as a Nisga’a primer for students published in 1897.  These were published by the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]] (SPCK).  These items included some portions of Scripture.

Like almost all other First Nations languages of British Columbia, Nisga’a is an [[endangered language]]. As of the 2016 census, there are only 500 native speakers out of a total ethnic population of around 5,500.&lt;ref name="census"&gt;[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?ALEVEL=3&amp;APATH=3&amp;CATNO=&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=&amp;DS=99&amp;FL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;GAL=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;GRP=1&amp;IPS=&amp;METH=0&amp;ORDER=1&amp;PID=89189&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;RL=0&amp;S=1&amp;ShowAll=No&amp;StartRow=1&amp;SUB=705&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;Theme=70&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF= Statistics Canada: 2006 Census] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016163022/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?ALEVEL=3&amp;APATH=3&amp;CATNO=&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=&amp;DS=99&amp;FL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;GAL=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;GRP=1&amp;IPS=&amp;METH=0&amp;ORDER=1&amp;PID=89189&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;RL=0&amp;S=1&amp;ShowAll=No&amp;StartRow=1&amp;SUB=705&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;Theme=70&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF= |date=2013-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revitalization efforts ===
In January 2012, a Nisga’a app for [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] was released for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstvoices.com/en/apps|title=FirstVoices Apps|work=FirstVoices|accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently, the app was made available for use on Android.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstvoices.com/en/Nisgaa|title=FirstVoices: Nisga’a Community Portal|accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nisga'a app is a bilingual dictionary and phrase collection archived at the [[First Voices]] data base, resources include audio recordings, images and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nisgaa/id490034233?mt=8|title=Nisga'a on the App Store|website=App Store|language=en|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1990, the [[First Peoples' Heritage, Language and Culture Council|First Peoples' Heritage Language and Culture Council]] has been providing support to revitalize First Peoples' language, arts and cultures. A total of $20 million has been distributed to support various projects, including revitalization of Nisga'a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fpcc.ca/about-us/|title=First Peoples' Cultural Council  {{!}} About us|website=www.fpcc.ca|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[First Voices]] website, an online language archive was created to support language documentation, language teaching, and revitalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstvoices.com/en/about#info2|title=FirstVoices|website=www.firstvoices.com|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.firstvoices.com/en/Nisgaa Nisga'a] First Voices is publicly accessible.

In 1993, the Wilp Wilx̱o'oskwhl Nisg̱a'a Institute (WWNI) was established to provide post-secondary education for Nisga'a community and promote language and culture revitalization. It is the Nisga'a university-college located in the Nass Valley in Gitwinksihlkw on the northwest coast of British Columbia. The WWNI is a community driven, non-profit organization that is affiliated with the University of Northern British Columbia, Northwest Community College, and Royal Roads University. It is the only place where students can earn accreditation and certification of its courses and programs in Nisga'a Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wwni.bc.ca/?page_id=25|title=About «  Welcome to WWNI – Nisga'a House of Wisdom|website=wwni.bc.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''North''' or '''West Bougainville languages''' are a small [[language family]] spoken on the island of [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]. They were classified as [[East Papuan languages]] by [[Stephen Wurm]], but this does not now seem tenable, and was abandoned in ''[[Ethnologue]]'' (2009).

The family includes the closely related Rotokas and Eivo languages, plus two languages that are only distantly related:

* [[Keriaka language|Keriaka]] (Ramopa)
* [[Konua language|Konua]] (Rapoisi)
* Rotokas branch
** [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]]

A '''palm court''' is a large [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] with [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], usually in a prestigious hotel, where functions are staged, notably [[tea dance]]s.  Examples include the [[Langham Hotel, London|Langham Hotel]] (1865), [[Alexandra Palace]] (1873), the [[Carlton Hotel, London|Carlton Hotel]] (1899), and the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] (1906), all in [[London]]; and the [[Palm Court (Alexandria Hotel)|Alexandria Hotel]] (court added in 1911) in [[Los Angeles, California]], and Plaza Hotel in New York city. Capitalizing on their popularity, some [[ocean liner]]s also had palm courts, notably the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] (1912).

The concept of the palm court orchestra, a small orchestra playing light classical music, comes from this root.

[[Image:Cover US philatelic 1925.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A 1925 philatelic cover, produced by adding common foreign stamps to a usage of a United States 2-cent of the "Norse-American issue". The postal clerk should have rejected this cover, but instead the foreign stamps received US postmarks. From left to right, the stamps are from [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[French Guiana]], [[United States]], and [[French India]].]]

A '''philatelic cover''' is an [[cover (philately)|envelope]] prepared with a stamp(s) and address and sent through the mail delivery system for the purpose of creating a collectible item. [[Stamp collector]]s began to send mail to each other and to themselves early on, and philatelic mail is known from the late 19th century onward.  While some collectors specialize in philatelic covers, especially [[first day cover]]s and [[cachet]]ed covers, others regard them as contrived objects that are not reflective of real-world usage, and often will pay a higher price for a cover that represents genuine commercial use. However, mail sent by stamp collectors is no less a genuine article of postage than is mail sent with no concern of seeing the mailed item again. Philatelic covers include mail from first airmail flight and first day of stamp issues ceremonies. Over the years there have been numerous Expositions where special postmarks are made and where a post office is set up where mail can be sent from on the given date of the Expo'.  Like any other genuine item of mail these covers include postage stamps and postmarks of the time period and were processed and delivered by an official postal system. Often a philatelic cover will have more historical significance than randomly mailed covers as philatelic covers are also often mailed from the location on the date of an important or noteworthy event, like an inauguration or a space launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stamps.about.com/od/historyofphilately/tp/Collecting-Philatelic-Covers.htm Collecting Different Types Of Philatelic Covers, John Finch]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Officercolorado.jpg|thumb|right|Last day of service cover from the [[discontinued post office]] at Officer, Colorado]]
The possible kinds of philatelic covers are only limited by the imagination of creative collectors, but there are a number of well-known categories:
* [[First day cover]]s, mailed on the [[first day of issue]] of a stamp.
* [[Cachet]]ed covers, sent on envelopes with additional artwork, usually relating to the theme of the stamp.
* Covers with special or commemorative cancellations used temporarily by a post office.
* Covers with cancellations from unusual places.
* Covers sent to collect particular [[postal marking]]s.
* "One of everything" cover, all stamps of a new or old issue affixed to the cover.
* Unnecessary [[mixed franking]]s.
* Last day of service of a [[discontinued post office]]

==Identifying philatelic covers==
[[File:British Berwick on Tweed philatelic mail 1936.jpg|thumbnail|right|Not all philatelic covers are as obvious as this one.]]
Philatelic covers are normally very easy to spot but sometimes they can escape detection by the inexperienced philatelist. Characteristics include:
*The cover is still sealed and appears to be empty.
*The stamps used are far above that needed for the postal service used.
*The cover is addressed to a well known dealer.
*The stamps include a full set of one particular issue, possibly applied in order of value.
*The stamps are applied very tidily and/or the postmark appears to have been very carefully applied so as not to obscure too much of the stamps.
*The cover bears a cachet or special design, usually on the left side portion of the envelope.
*The address consists of a small rubber stamp or adhesive label in the bottom right hand corner of the cover.
*The cover has a rarely seen combination of stamps, for instance with stamps that were issued many years apart.

While many philatelists prefer genuine commercial covers to philatelically contrived covers, philatelic covers may still be acceptable in collections of countries and eras where few other covers exist. Whether the cover was contrived or not, it is still an item of mail sent through the same postal system as other covers from a given country, with a postage stamp(s) and postmark, and is often more historically significant than covers set with no intention of recovery.

==Famous philatelic covers==
Various types of covers, usually prepared by collectors, historians or other enthusiasts, have great historical significance and, regardless of the intention for the mailed item, are sometimes noteworthy or famous in their own right.

===Zeppelin mail===

{{main|Zeppelin mail}}
Among the most definitive examples of famous or popular philatelic covers is Zeppelin mail.  These are covers that were carried aboard zeppelins in the 1930s and bear special postmarks and other special markings. Because the new Zeppelins were the fastest way to get mail delivered across the Atlantic Ocean they carried a great deal of mail. Because of all the fanfare surrounding the Zeppelins most of mail carried aboard were Zeppelin first flight covers. Much of the funding for the Zeppelin delivery system was generated by collectors and other enthusiasts of the period. Because of the fast mail delivery service there was a lot of  commercial mail aboard these vessels. Mail service across the Atlantic Ocean was reduced from weeks to a few days. Hindenburg’s 2-1/2 day service was the fastest way to send mail between Europe and North America in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airships.net/zeppelin-mail Airships: The Hindenburg and other Zeppelins]&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Flight mail===
{{main|First flight cover}}
[[Image:First airmail flight Wash NYC 1918.jpg|thumb|An A.C. Roessler cover carried on the first scheduled U.S. Air Mail flight from Washington DC to New York City, May 15, 1918.]]
With the advent of air travel it wasn't long before airplanes were carrying the mail between distant points about the globe. In the United States and Germany Air Mail delivery was greeted with the same national enthusiasm and fanfare as was experienced with the first trips to the moon by US Astronauts. Consequently, many people sent philatelic mail to themselves or friends that was carried aboard these flights in order to get a souvenir of the historic event. [[First flight cover]]s carried aboard are very popular and famous in some cases. The first scheduled U.S. Air Mail service began on May 15, 1918, and carried mail from Washington DC to New York City. The type of airplane used was the U.S. Army Curtiss JN-4 "Jenny" biplanes flown by army pilots with an intermediate stop in Philadelphia (Bustleton Field). Among those who were on hand for the departure of the first flight from Washington, D.C., were President [[Woodrow Wilson]], U.S. Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson, and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. Army Lt. George L. Boyle was selected to pilot aircraft #38262 on the first Northbound flight which, unfortunately, turned out to be a somewhat less than successful initial venture.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A.D.

He has been identified by some with the military commander of the same name, mentioned in a [[Latin]] inscription of 260 as having lost his life in the colony of [[Auzia]] in [[Mauretania]] Caesariensis.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', viii, 9047.&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable fragments of his work (probably called ''De hortis''), which treated of the cultivation of trees and vegetables, and also of their medicinal properties, have survived, chiefly in the body of and as an appendix to the ''[[Medicina Plinii]]'' (an anonymous 4th century handbook of medical recipes based upon [[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Naturalis Historiae]]'', xx&amp;ndash;xxxii).&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Martialis, Quintus Gargilius|volume=17|page=790}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extant sections treat of [[apple]]s, [[peach]]es, [[quince]]s, [[citron]]s, [[almond]]s, [[chestnut]]s, [[parsnip]]s, and various other edibles, with an emphasis on the medical effects they have on the body (quoting [[Dioscorides]] sometimes).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Gargilius also wrote a treatise on the tending of cattle ({{lang|la|De curis boum}}). A biography of the emperor [[Alexander Severus]] is also attributed to him in the ''[[Historia Augusta|Augustan History]].''&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; This attribution has been read as a joke by some critics.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

'''Sentence arrangement''' refers to the location of ideas and the placement of emphasis within a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. Based on these factors, a sentence may be classified as ''loose'', ''balanced'', ''periodic'', or ''[[Loose sentence|cumulative]]''.

==Examples==
A '''loose sentence''' expresses the main thought near the beginning and adds explanatory material as needed.
*''We bashed the [[piñata]] for 15 minutes without denting it'', although we at least avoided denting one another's craniums and, with masks raised, finally pried the candy out with a screwdriver.

A '''cumulative sentence''' places the general idea in the main [[clause]] and gives it greater precision with [[Grammatical modifier|modifying words]], [[phrase]]s, or clauses placed before it, after it, or in the middle of it. In this example, the phrases ''eyes squinting'', ''puffy'', and ''always on alert'' look forward to the pronoun ''he'' in the main clause; the phrases after the word ''forest'' look back  to the word ''week'' in the main clause.
*Eyes squinting, puffy, always on alert, ''he showed the effects of a week in the forest'', a brutal week, a week of staggering in circles driven by the baying of wolves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3445">A '''stunt cock''' is the term for a substitute (sometimes prosthetic) penis that is used during the shooting of [[pornographic film]]s.

The stunt cock is used in an extreme close up so as not to identify its bearer, the goal being to deceive the viewer into thinking that the stunt cock is the penis of the main actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Partridge|first=Eric|author2=Dalzell, Tom |author3=Victor, Terry |title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2006|volume=2|pages=1895|isbn=0-415-25938-X|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mAdUqLrKw4YC&amp;pg=PA1895&amp;dq=%22stunt+cock%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Jonathon|title=Cassell's Dictionary of Slang|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|location=125 Strand, London WC2R 0BB|year=2005|edition=Second|pages=1385|isbn=0-304-36636-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5GpLcC4a5fAC&amp;pg=PA1385&amp;dq=%22stunt+cock%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a stunt cock is analogous to a "[[stunt man]]," who anonymously does dangerous live-action sequences in place of the main actor. However, a stunt cock seldom performs dangerous acts on film. Though the term draws its name from this term, its practical application is more analogous to a [[body double]].

==Industry role==
Stunt cock work is a very common "workhorse" position in the pornography industry. The majority of prominent male pornographic actors have worked in this capacity at least once. Some actors work as stunt cocks specifically out of a desire for anonymity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Work on a pornographic film can be very demanding, and it is often difficult for actors to perform on demand as needed. A common function of a stunt cock is to stand in for an actor who is unable to achieve erection or ejaculation or an actor who has a penis of a relatively similar size, so that filming can continue on schedule.&lt;ref name="Editorial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/exclusives/xero/xero4.html|title= How to shoot a 'live' adult video|last=Xero|first=Xanadu |publisher=The Raw Story|accessdate=2008-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* In the 1976 film ''[[The First Nudie Musical]]'', the character Rosie (played by [[Cindy Williams]] of ''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley]]'' fame) announces the arrival of a "stunt cock" to complete the filming of a key porn scene. 
* In the 1997 [[Trey Parker]] film ''[[Orgazmo]]'', the protagonist's director assigns him a stunt cock, as he doesn't want to participate in the sexual scenes due to his [[Mormon]] affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The stunt-cock is here!|url=http://filmfanatic.org/reviews/?p=60|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In the sixth book of ''[[The Dresden Files]]'', ''[[Blood Rites (novel)|Blood Rites]]'', Harry investigates a pornographic film crew and is mistaken for a stunt cock by one of the actors.
* A stunt cock is used in the TV show ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]'' to complete the filming of ''Vagina Town'' when the lead actor has "coke dick".

==Example of non-pornographic films where stunt cocks have been used==
* [[Antichrist (film)|Antichrist]], directed by [[Lars von Trier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Porrskådis spelade Willem Dafoes penis|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/article11926594.ab|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Copper plates NMND-9.JPG|right|200px|thumb|Copper plate inscriptions in ''Kannada-Telugu script'']]
Between 1100 CE and 1400 CE [[Kannada script]] and [[Telugu script]] separated from Old-Kannada script ([[Halegannada]] script) or [[Kadamba script]] or [[Bhattiprolu script]]. The [[Chalukyas]] influenced the modern form of Telugu script and its similarity with modern Kannada script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.engr.mun.ca/~adluri/telugu/language/script/script1d.html | title=Evolution of Telugu Character Graphs | accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Old Kannada]] script is the continuation of the [[Kadamba script]], which was used for writing [[Kannada]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] languages. Telugu and Kannada Scripts are strikingly similar. 

The Dravidian family comprising about ''73 languages'' including Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Malayalam. Kannada [[abugida]] was developed between the 1st and 3rd centuries CE from '''Chalukya and Kadamba scripts''', descendants of Brahmi. Old Kannada script is about 1800 years old, developed into Modern Telugu and Modern Kannada scripts. The Telugu script is closely related to Kannada, earliest known inscriptions dates back to the 6th century CE, poetry begins to appear in the 11th century. New written standard emerged in Telugu during the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/unger26/Wrtg%20sys%20exhibit.pdf | title=A sampler of the world’s writing systems | publisher=J.

==History==
During 4th to 7th centuries AD the Early [[Chalukyas|Bādāmi Chālukyās]] and Early [[Kadambas|Banavasi Kadambās]] used early form of ''Kannada script'' in inscriptions. The early [[Eastern Chalukyas]] and  [[Salankayana]] who ruled the [[Kannada]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] speaking areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_epigraphical_sans_indiaabroad.asp | title=Epigraphical Studies in India - Sanskrit and Dravidian, Scripts used in India, Scripts Abroad | accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of Kannada-Telugu Script==
Kannada and Telugu belongs to Dravidian family of languages in southern India, Saatavaahanas introduced the Brahmi to present day Telugu and Kannada speaking regions. Kannada and Telugu scripts are categorized under Old Kannada script. Kannada became a literate language much ahead of Telugu language. Both Kannada and Telugu produced the poetry during the eighth century. The full-fledged literary works in Kannada produced in ninth century, two centuries before the works available in Telugu&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/kavirajamarga-a-tour-with-a-difference/article20919519.ece&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavirajamarga&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Hans/2014-11-12/Aadi-Kavi-Nannayas-brilliant-translation-of-the-Mahabharata/115876&lt;/ref&gt;. The combined Kannada-Telugu script called as ''Old Kannada''. Telugu writers waited till 11th century because of socio-political factors (royal patronage, influence of Buddhism and Jainism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.engr.mun.ca/~adluri/telugu/language/script/script1a.html | title=Origins of Telugu Script | accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lexicon of Comicana''''' is a 1980 book by the American [[cartoonist]] [[Mort Walker]]. It was intended as a [[tongue-in-cheek]] look at the devices used by cartoonists. In it, Walker invented an international set of [[symbol]]s called ''symbolia'' after researching cartoons around the world. In 1964, Walker had written an article called "Let's Get Down to Grawlixes", a satirical piece for the [[National Cartoonists Society]]. He used terms such as ''grawlixes'' for his own amusement, but they soon began to catch on and acquired an unexpected validity. The ''Lexicon'' was written in response to this.

The names he invented for them sometimes appear in [[dictionary|dictionaries]], and serve as convenient terminology occasionally used by cartoonists and critics. A 2001 gallery showing of comic- and street-influenced art in [[San Francisco]], for example, was called "Plewds! Squeans! and Spurls!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stretcher.org/posts/plewds_squeams_and_spurls/ “Plewds! Squeams! and Spurls!”]; published November 29, 2001; retrieved June 4, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tongan''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɒ|ŋ|ən}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|to|lea fakatonga}}'') is an [[Austronesian language]] of the [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] branch spoken in [[Tonga]]. It has around 180,000 speakers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ton|title=Tongan|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a [[national language]] of [[Tonga]]. It is a [[verb–subject–object|VSO]] (verb–subject–object) language.

==Related languages==
Tongan is one of the multiple languages in the [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] branch of the Austronesian languages, along with [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Maori language|Maori]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]] and [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], for example. Together with [[Niuean language|Niuean]], it forms the [[Tongic languages|Tongic]] subgroup of Polynesian.

Tongan is unusual among Polynesian languages in that it has a so-called ''definitive accent''. As with all Polynesian languages, Tongan has adapted the phonological system of proto-Polynesian.

# Tongan has retained the original proto-Polynesian *h, but has merged it with the original *s as {{IPA|/h/}}. (The {{IPA|/s/}} found in modern Tongan derives from *t before high front vowels). Most Polynesian languages have lost the original proto-Polynesian glottal stop {{IPA|/q/}}; however, it has been retained in Tongan and a few other languages including Rapa Nui.&lt;ref&gt;The glottal stop in most other Polynesian languages are the reflexes of other consonants of proto-Polynesian; for example, the glottal stop of Samoan and Hawaiian is a reflex of the original *k; the glottal stop of Cook Islands Māori represents a merger of the original *f and *s. Tongan does not show changes such as the *t to {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|*ŋ}} to {{IPA|/n/}} of Hawaiian; nor has Tongan shifted *f to {{IPA|/h/}}. Although Tongan, Samoan and other Western Polynesian languages are not affected by a change in [[Central Eastern Polynesian languages]] (such as [[Māori language|New Zealand Māori]]) involving the dissimilation of {{IPA|/faf/}} to {{IPA|/wah/}}, Tongan has vowel changes (as seen in ''monumanu'' from original ''manumanu'') which are not a feature of other languages.&lt;/ref&gt;
# In proto-Polynesian, *r and *l were distinct phonemes, but in most Polynesian languages they have merged, represented orthographically as ''r'' in most East Polynesian languages, and as ''l'' in most West Polynesian languages. However, the distinction can be reconstructed because Tongan kept the *l but lost the *r.&lt;ref&gt;This loss may be quite recent. The word "lua", meaning "two", is still found in some placenames and archaic texts. "Marama" (light) thus became "maama", and the two successive "a"s are still pronounced separately, not yet contracted to "māma". On the other hand "toro" (sugarcane) already has become "tō" (still "tolo" in Sāmoan).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alphabet==
Tongan is written in a subset of the [[Latin script]]. In the old, "missionary" [[alphabet]], the order of the letters was modified: the [[vowels]] were put first and then followed by the [[consonants]]: a, e, i, o, u, etc. Thar was still so as of the [[Privy Council]] decision of 1943 on the orthography of the Tongan language. However, C. M. Churchward's grammar and dictionary favoured the standard European alphabetical order, which, since his time, has been in use exclusively:

Notes:
# written as '''g''' but still pronounced as {{IPA|[ŋ]}} (as in Samoan) before 1943
# [[Aspiration (phonetics)|unaspirated]]; written as '''b''' before 1943
# sometimes written as '''j''' before 1943 (see below)
# the [[glottal stop]]. It should be written with the modifier letter turned comma ([[Unicode]] 0x02BB) and not with the [[Quotation mark|single quote]] open or with a mixture of quotes open and quotes close. See also [[ʻOkina|{{okina}}okina]].

Note that the above order is strictly followed in proper dictionaries. Therefore, ''ngatu'' follows ''nusi'', ''{{okina}}a'' follows ''vunga'' and it also follows ''z'' if foreign words occur. Words with [[Vowel length|long vowels]] come directly after those with short vowels. Improper wordlists may or may not follow these rules. (For example, the Tonga [[telephone directory]] for years now ignores all rules.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}})

The original '''j''', used for {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, disappeared in the beginning of the 20th century, merging with {{IPA|/s/}}. By 1943, '''j''' was no longer used. Consequently, many words written with '''s''' in Tongan are cognate to those with '''t''' in other Polynesian languages. For example, ''Masisi'' (a star name) in Tongan is cognate with ''Matiti'' in [[Tokelau language|Tokelauan]]; ''siale'' ([[Gardenia]] taitensis) in Tongan and ''tiare'' in [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]]. This seems to be a natural development, as {{IPA|/tʃ/}} in many Polynesian languages derived from Proto-Polynesian {{IPA|/ti/}}.

== Syllabification ==

*Each syllable has exactly one vowel. The number of syllables in a word is exactly equal to the number of vowels it has.
*Long vowels, indicated with a '''toloi''' ([[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]), count as one, but may in some circumstances be split up in two short ones, in which case, they are both written. Toloi are supposed to be written where needed, in practice this may be seldom done.
*Each syllable may have no more than one consonant.
*Consonant combinations are not permitted. The '''[[Ng (character)|ng]]''' is not a consonant combination, since it represents a single sound. As such it can never be split, the proper [[Syllabification|hyphenation]] of fakatonga (Tongan) therefore is fa-ka-to-nga.
*Each syllable must end in a vowel. All vowels are pronounced, but an '''i''' at the end of an utterance is usually unvoiced.
*The '''fakau{{okina}}a''' is a consonant. It must be followed (and, except at the beginning of a word, preceded) by a vowel. Unlike the glottal stops in many other Polynesian languages texts, the fakau{{okina}}a is always written. (Only sometimes before 1943.)
*Stress normally falls on the next to last syllable of a word with two or more syllables; example: móhe (sleep), mohénga (bed). If, however, the last vowel is long, it takes the stress; example: kumā (mouse) (stress on the long ā). The stress also shifts to the last vowel if the next word is an [[clitic|enclitic]]; example: fále (house), falé ni (this house). Finally the stress can shift to the last syllable, including an enclitic, in case of the definitive accent; example: mohengá ((that) particular bed), fale ní (this particular house). It is also here that a long vowel can be split into two short ones; example: pō (night), poó ni (this night), pō ní (this particular night). Or the opposite: maáma (light), māmá ni (this light), maama ní (this particular light). Of course, there are some exceptions to the above general rules. The stress [[Acute accent|accent]] is normally not written, except where it is to indicate the definitive accent or '''fakamamafa'''. But here, too, people often neglect to write it, only using it when the proper stress cannot be easily derived from the context.

Although the acute accent has been available on most [[personal computer]]s from their early days onwards, when Tongan newspapers started to use computers around 1990 to produce their papers, they were unable to find, or failed to enter, the proper keystrokes, and it grew into a habit to put the accent after the vowel instead of on it: not '''á''' but '''a´'''. But as this distance seemed to be too big, a demand arose for Tongan fonts where the acute accent was shifted to the right, a position halfway in between the two extremes above. Most papers still follow this practice.

==Articles==
English, like most European languages, uses only two [[Article (grammar)|article]]s:
* indefinite '''a'''
* definite '''the'''

By contrast, Tongan has three articles, and [[Possessive pronoun|possessives]] also have a three-level definiteness distinction:
* indefinite '''ha'''. Example: ko ha pālangi ('a white person', or any other person from somewhere other than Tonga)
* semi-definite '''(h)e'''. Example: ko e pālangi ('the white person' in the sense that the person does not belong to some other race, but still rather 'a white person' if there are several of them)
* definite '''(h)e''' with the shifted ultimate stress. Example: ko e pālangí ('the white person', that particular person there and no one else).

==Registers==
There are three [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] which consist of
* ordinary words (the normal language)
* honorific words (the language for the chiefs)
* regal words (the language for the king)
There are also further distinctions between 
* polite words (used for more formal contexts)
* derogatory words (used for informal contexts, or to indicate humility)
For example, the phrase "Come and eat!" translates to:
* ordinary: ''ha{{okina}}u {{okina}}o kai'' (come and eat!); Friends, family members and so forth may say this to each other when invited for dinner.
* honorific: ''me{{okina}}a mai pea {{okina}}ilo'' (come and eat!); The proper used towards chiefs, particularly the nobles, but it may also be used by an employee towards his boss, or in other similar situations. When talking about chiefs, however, it is always used, even if they are not actually present, but in other situations only on formal occasions. A complication to the beginning student of Tongan is that such words very often also have an alternative meaning in the ordinary register: ''me{{okina}}a'' (thing) and ''{{okina}}ilo'' (know, find).
* regal: ''hā{{okina}}ele mai pea taumafa'' (come and eat!); Used towards the king or God. The same considerations as for the honorific register apply. ''Hā{{okina}}ele'' is one of the regal words which have become the normal word in other Polynesian languages.

==Pronouns==
The Tongan language distinguishes 3 [[Grammatical number|numbers]]: singular, [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]], and [[plural]]. They appear as the 3 major columns in the tables below.

The Tongan language distinguishes 4 persons: First person [[Clusivity|exclusive]], first person [[Clusivity|inclusive]], second person and third person. They appear as the 4 major rows in the tables below.  This gives us 12 main groups.

===Subjective and objective===

In addition, possessive pronouns are either [[alienable possession|alienable]] (reddish) or [[inalienable possession|inalienable]] (greenish), which Churchward termed ''subjective'' and ''objective''. This marks a distinction that has been referred to, in some analyses of other [[Polynesian languages]], as ''a-possession'' versus ''o-possession'', respectively,&lt;ref&gt;These ''a'' and ''o'' refer to the characteristic vowel used in those pronouns. In Tongan, however, this distinction is much less clear, and rather a characteristic for the indefinite and definite forms respectively. Use of the ''a'' &amp; ''o'' terms therefore is not favoured.&lt;/ref&gt; though more Tongan-appropriate version would be ''{{okina}}e-possession'' and ''ho-possession''.

''Subjective'' and ''objective'' are fitting labels when dealing with verbs: ''{{okina}}eku taki'' "my leading" vs. ''hoku taki'' "my being led".  However, this is less apt when used on nouns.  Indeed, in most contexts ''hoku taki'' would be interpreted as "my leader", as a noun rather than a verb.  What then of nouns that have no real verb interpretation, such as ''fale'' "house"?

Churchward himself laid out the distinction thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Churchward
 | first = C.M.
 | title = Tongan Grammar
 | publisher = Vava'u Press Limited
 | date = 1999
 | pages = 81
 | isbn = 982-213-007-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;But what about those innumerable cases in which the possessive can hardly be said to correspond either to the subject or to the object of a verb?  What, for example, is the rule or the guiding principle, which lies behind the fact that a Tongan says ''{{okina}}eku pa{{okina}}anga'' for ' my money' but ''hoku fale'' for 'my house'?

It may be stated as follows: the use of ''{{okina}}eku'' for 'my' implies that I am active, influential, or formative, &amp;c., towards the thing mentioned, whereas the use of ''hoku'' for 'my' implies that the thing mentioned is active, influential, or formative, &amp;c., towards me.  Or, provided that we give a sufficiently wide meaning to the word 'impress', we may say, perhaps, that ''{{okina}}eku'' is used in reference to things upon which I impress myself, while ''hoku'' is used in reference to things which impress themselves upon me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{okina}}E possessives are generally used for:

*Goods, money, tools, utensils, instruments, weapons, vehicles, and other possessions which the subject owns or uses (''{{okina}}eku pa{{okina}}anga'', "my money")
*Animals or birds which the subjects owns or uses (''{{okina}}eku fanga puaka'', "my pigs")
*Things which the subject eats, drinks, or smokes (''{{okina}}eku me{{okina}}akai'', "my food")
*Things which the subject originates, makes, mends, carries, or otherwise deals with (''{{okina}}eku kavenga'', "my burden")
*Persons in the subject's employ, under their control, or in their care (''{{okina}}eku tamaio{{okina}}eiki'' "my male servant")

Ho possessives are generally used for

*Things which are a part of the subject or 'unalienable' from the subject, such as body parts (''hoku sino'', "my body")
*Persons or things which represent the subject (''hoku hingoa'', "my name")
*The subject's relatives, friends, associates, or enemies (''hoku hoa'', "my companion (spouse)")
*Things which are provided for the subject or devolve to them or fall to their lot (''hoku tofi{{okina}}a'', "my inheritance")
*In general, persons or things which surround, support, or control the subject, or on which the subject depends (''hoku kolo'', "my village/town")

There are plenty of exceptions which do not fall under the guidelines above, for instance, ''{{okina}}eku tamai'', "my father".  The number of exceptions is large enough to make the alienable and inalienable distinction appear on the surface to be as arbitrary as the [[grammatical gender]] distinction for Romance languages, but by and large the above guidelines hold true.

===Cardinal pronouns===
The cardinal pronouns are the main [[personal pronoun]]s which in Tongan can either be preposed (before the [[verb]], light colour) or postposed (after the verb, dark colour). The first are the normal alienable possessive pronouns, the latter the stressed alienable pronouns, which are sometimes uses as [[reflexive pronoun]]s, or with ''kia te'' in front the inalienable possessive forms. (There is no possession involved in the cardinal pronouns and therefore no alienable or inalienable forms).

Remember:
*all the preposed pronouns of one syllable only (ku, u, ma, te, ta, ke, mo, ne, na) are enclitics which never can take the stress, but put it on the vowel in front of them. Example: ''ʻoku naú'' versus ''ʻokú na'' (not: ''ʻoku ná'').
*first person singular, ''I'' uses '''u''' after ''kuo'', ''te'', ''ne'', and also ''ka'' (becomes ''kau''), ''pea'', ''mo'' and ''ʻo''; but uses '''ou''' after ''ʻoku''; and uses '''ku''' after ''naʻa''.
*first person inclusive (I and you) is of course somewhat a misnomer, at least in the singular. The meanings of ''te'' and ''kita'' can often rendered as ''one'', that is the modesty ''I''.
Examples of use.
*Naʻa '''ku''' fehuʻi: I asked
*Naʻe fehuʻi (ʻe) '''au''': I(!) asked (stressed)
*ʻOku '''ou''' fehuʻi '''au''': I ask myself
*Te '''u''' fehuʻi kiate '''koe''': I shall ask you
*Te '''ke''' tali kiate '''au''': You will answer me
*Kapau te '''te''' fehuʻi: If one would ask
*'''Tau''' ō ki he hulohula?: Are we (all) going to the ball?
*Sinitalela, '''mau''' ō ki he hulohula: [[Cinderella]], we go to the ball (... said the evil stepmother, and she went with two of her daughters, but not Cinderella)

Another archaic aspect of Tongan is the retention of preposed pronouns.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} They are used much less frequently in Sāmoan and have completely disappeared in East Polynesian languages, where the pronouns are cognate with the Tongan postposed form minus ''ki-''. (We love you: ʻOku ʻofa kimautolu kia te kimoutolu; Māori: e aroha nei mātou i a koutou).

===Possessive pronouns===
The [[Possessive pronoun|possessives]] for every person and number (1st person plural, 3rd person dual, etc.) can be further divided into normal or ordinary (light colour), emotional (medium colour) and emphatic (bright colour) forms. The latter is rarely used, but the two former are common and further subdivided in [[Definite pronoun|definite]] (saturated colour) and [[Indefinite pronoun|indefinite]] (greyish colour) forms.

Notes:
#the ordinary definite possessives starting with ''he'' (in italics) drop this prefix after any word except ''ʻi, ki, mei, ʻe''. Example: ''ko ʻeku tohi'', my book; ''ʻi heʻeku tohi'', in my book.
#all ordinary alienable possessive forms contain a [[fakauʻa]], the inalienable forms do not.
#the emphatic forms are not often used, but if they are, they take the definitive accent from the following words (see below)
#first person inclusive (me and you) is of course somewhat a misnomer. The meanings of ''heʻete, hoto'', etc. can often rendered as ''one's'', that is the modesty ''me''.
#the choice between an alienable or inalienable possessive is determined by the word or phrase it refers to. For example: ''ko ho fale'' '(it is) your house' (inalienable), ''ko ho'o tohi'', '(it is) your book' (alienable). *''Ko ho tohi, ko hoʻo fale''* are wrong. Some words can take either, but with a difference in meaning: ''ko ʻene taki'' 'his/her leadership'; ''ko hono taki'' 'his/her leader'.

Examples of use.
*ko haʻaku/haku kahoa: my garland (any garland from or for me)
*ko ʻeku/hoku kahoa: my garland (it is my garland)
*ko ʻeku/hoku kahoá: my garland, that particular one and no other
*ko heʻete/hoto kahoa: one's garland {mine in fact, but that is not important}
*ko siʻaku kahoa: my cherished garland (any cherished garland from or for me)
*ko siʻeku/siʻoku kahoa: my cherished garland (it is my cherished garland)
*ko haʻakú/hoʻokú kahoa: garland (emphatically mine) &amp;ndash; that particular garland is mine and not someone else's
*ko homa kahoa: our garlands (exclusive: you and I are wearing them, but not the person we are talking to)
*ko hota kahoa: our garlands (inclusive: you and I are wearing them, and I am talking to you)

===Other pronouns===
These are the remainders: the pronominal adjectives (mine), [[indirect object]] pronouns or [[pronominal adverbs]] (for me) and the adverbial possessives (as me).

Notes:
#the first syllable in all singular pronominal adjectives (in italics) is reduplicated and can be dropped for somewhat less emphasis
*the pronominal adjectives put a stronger emphasis on the possessor than the possessive pronouns do
*the use of the adverbial possessives is rare
Examples of use:
*ko hono valá: it is his/her/its clothing/dress
*ko e vala ʻona: it is his/her/its (!) clothing/dress
*ko e vala ʻoʻona: it is his/her/its (!!!) clothing/dress
*ko hono valá ʻona: it is his/her/its own clothing/dress
*ko hono vala ʻoná: it is his/her/its own clothing/dress; same as previous
*ko hono vala ʻoʻoná: it is his/her/its very own clothing/dress
*ʻoku ʻoʻona ʻa e valá ni: this cloting is his/hers/its
*ʻoku moʻona ʻa e valá: the clothing is for him/her/it
*ʻoange ia moʻono valá: give it (to him/her/it) as his/hers/its clothing

==Literature==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2010}}
Tongan is primarily a spoken, rather than written, language. The [[Bible]] and the [[Book of Mormon]] were translated into Tongan and few other books were written in it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

There are several weekly and monthly magazines in Tongan, but there are no daily newspapers.

Weekly newspapers, some of them twice per week:
*''Ko e Kalonikali ʻo Tonga''
*''Ko e Keleʻa''
*''Taimi ʻo Tonga''
*''Talaki''
*''Ko e Tauʻatāina''

Monthly or two-monthly papers, mostly church publications:
*''Taumuʻa lelei'' ([[Catholic Church]])
*''Tohi fanongonongo'' ([[Free Wesleyan Church|Free Wesleyan]])
*''Liahona'' ([[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://lds.org/languages/mainmenu/0,5362,88-22,00.html Online Tongan edition of Liahona, lds.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ofa ki Tonga'' (Tokaikolo)

==Calendar==
The Tongan calendar was based on the phases of the moon and had 13 months. The main purpose of the calendar, for Tongans, was to determine the time for the planting and cultivation of yams, which were Tonga's most important staple food.

It includes all surrounding points that are in [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] with that location and excludes points that are beyond the [[horizon]] or obstructed by terrain and other features (e.g., buildings, trees). Conversely, it can also refer to area from which an object can be seen.&lt;ref name=VIAHP/&gt; A viewshed is not necessarily "[[visible spectrum|visible]]" to humans; the same concept is used in [[radio communication]]s to indicate where a specific combination of transmitter, antenna, and terrain allow reception of signal.

Viewsheds are commonly used in [[viewshed analysis|terrain analysis]], which is of interest to [[urban planning]], [[archaeology]], and [[military science]]. In urban planning, for example, viewsheds tend to be calculated for areas of particular scenic or historic value that are deemed worthy of preservation against development or other change. Viewsheds are often calculated for public areas — for example, from public roadways, public parks, or high-rise buildings. The preservation of viewsheds is frequently a goal in the designation of [[open space reserve|open space]] areas, [[green belt]]s, and [[community separator]]s.

==Representation==

A viewshed can be represented by [[raster data]] indicating the visibility of a viewpoint for or from an area of interest. In a binary representation, a cell (shown graphically as a [[pixel]]) with a value of 1 (or "true") indicates that the viewpoint is visible from that cell, while a value of 0 (false) indicates that the viewpoint is not visible.  In certain disciplines, such as radio communications, "visibility" may be [[probability|probabilistic]] and therefore the viewshed may be represented with non-integer values. Viewsheds for multiple points, lines, or areas may have counts or fractional values for queries involving "how much" or "how many" (e.g., how much of a highway is visible?).

==Viewshed and total-viewshed computation==
A terrain can be represented using a regular grid of points called Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Where each point of the DEM is represented by its coordinates X, Y and its height Z.

Viewshed calculation on a large DEM is costly from a computational point of view. This cost is much higher when calculating the viewshed for all the points of the DEM, also called total-viewshed. A faster algorithm for computing the total-viewshed of large DEMs was proposed on.&lt;ref name=TotalViewshed2015/&gt;

==History==

Clifford Tandy is credited with coining the term "viewshed" in 1967 by analogy to ''[[wikt:watershed|watershed]]''.&lt;ref name=Steffen2011/&gt; The lexicographer [[Grant Barrett]] cites a use of the term from 1970 in the ''[[Oakland Tribune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waywordradio.org/viewshed_4/ |title=viewshed |work=A Way with Words |first=Grant |last=Barrett |date=March 27, 2006 |accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==

Viewsheds are a specific type of [[visibility graph]].

[[Isovist]]s are a closely related concept that is more common in the study of [[architecture]]. Viewsheds and isovists are sometimes said to be equivalent,&lt;ref name=Turner2001/&gt; however others have found differences between them. It has been argued that isovists are more focused on representing space whereas viewsheds are about the visibility of features.&lt;ref name=Weitkamp2011/&gt; Also, the problems they are used in have different scales. Planners use viewsheds where terrain heights come into play whereas architects do not typically take that into account with isovists.&lt;ref name=Weitkamp2011/&gt;

The area from which a structure can be seen may be called the "[[Zone of Visual Influence]]." This can be referred to as the viewshed as well, though.

Total-viewshed map refers to the map, where each point represents the number of Km² visible at that point in the DEM.&lt;ref name=TotalViewshed2015/&gt;

The 3D-viewshed of a point (X,Y) of the DEM consists of the visible space from that point.&lt;ref name=3DViewshed2016/&gt;

==Zone of visual influence==
A ''zone of visual influence'' is the area from which a development or other structure is theoretically visible.&lt;ref name="Association2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Association|first=European Wind Energy European Wind Energy|title=Wind Energy - The Facts: "A Guide to the Technology, Economics and Future of Wind Power"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bjhdT0f79U4C&amp;pg=PT205|accessdate=15 February 2013|date=2012-05-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136548598|pages=205–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually represented as a map using color to indicate visibility.

Zones of visual influence are used to identify the parts of a landscape that will be affected by a development.  They are of particular use to [[Landscape Architecture|landscape architects]] in determining visual intrusion as part of an [[environmental impact assessment]].  Zones of visual influence have been used extensively in [[wind farm]] development.  A map will be created showing the number of [[wind turbines]] that are visible from a particular area.  A cumulative zone of visual influence is used to define the cumulative effects of many developments.

Zones of visual influence are created using [[GIS]] tools.&lt;ref name="MorrisTherivel2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Peter|last2=Therivel|first2=Riki|title=Methods of Environmental Impact Assessment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XXBwx-UznToC&amp;pg=PA450|accessdate=15 February 2013|date=2009-03-05|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203892909|pages=450–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
