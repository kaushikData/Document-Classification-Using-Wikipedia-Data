      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17173">An '''access mat''' is a portable platform used to support equipment used in [[construction]] and other resource-based activities, including [[drilling rig]]s, camps, [[tank]]s, and [[helipad]]s. It may also be used as a [[structural road design|structural roadway]] to provide passage over unstable ground, [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]s and more. 

Depending on its application, an access mat may be called a rig mat, swamp mat, industrial mat, ground protection mat, road mat, construction mat, mud mat, mobile mat, safety mat, or portable roadway. Because there is no body governing or standardizing terminology (nor design and construction), and terminology inconsistencies are compounded by regional and industry-specific vernacular, the types described below should be considered a general guide to access matting.
==Types==
There are three general categories that describe access matting:
===Construction Mats===
Construction mats are used to provide relatively clean, smooth, all-weather working, walking and driving surfaces in industrial or commercial [[construction]] settings where access would not otherwise be guaranteed. This category of mat reduces crew downtime, increasing the likelihood of timely task completion. 

Construction mats have multiple applications, including:
*[[Oil and Gas]] sector: temporary roads, platforming on leases, pipeline terminals, and facilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.encana.com/communities/canada/duvernay/detail.html|title=Detailing the Duvernay|access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Overhead power line|Power lines]]: tower erection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2011/06/05/cmp-upgrade-boosts-little-known-industry_2011-06-05/|title=CMP upgrade boosts little-known industry: The project benefits Maine-based makers of wooden mats that allow trucks to park in wetlands.|date=June 5, 2011|access-date=June 3, 2018|last=Turkel|first=Tux|publisher=Portland Press Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Electrical_substation|Electrical sub-stations]]
*Construction of buildings and warehouses
*Residential housing projects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jwaoil.com/durabase-keeps-700m-residential-development-mud/|title=DuraBase keeps $700M residential development above mud|access-date=June 3, 2018|date=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (especially where local [[By-law|bylaws]] penalize depositing mud and dirt in situations where it may wash into [[storm drain]]s)

A subset of construction mat, pipeline mats, may be considered construction mats, though they often begin as a different type of access mat. Pipeline mats are typically mats at the end of their productive lives, used as a rough, one-time access setting.&lt;ref name=pipeline /&gt;
===Access Mats===
Access mats are a category of matting that are generally used to provide temporary roads and worksites. Access mats are often used to access work sites in remote or environmentally sensitive areas,&lt;ref name=tufftrack /&gt; such as [[bog]]s, [[wetland]]s or [[fen]]s. For that reason, they are often referred to as swamp, bog or wetland mats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.paradoxaccess.com/matting/access-mat-swamp-mat/|title=Access Mats - Total Service for Your Access Needs|access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swamp mats are based on a design developed by Joe Penland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality Mat Company: About|url=http://www.qmat.com/about/overview/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the late 20th century and consist of three layers of 2’ x 8’ lumber laminated together with steel bolts. Most commonly, the top and bottom layer are made up of 11 pieces and the middle layer, placed cross wise, is made from 21 pieces. In the USA, the majority of swamp mats are made from mixed hardwoods, although they are often referred to as oak. It is also usual to find hardwood mats in Canada, however the availability of durable coniferous species such as various [[firs]], [[pine]]s, and [[spruce]]s make their use a more economical prospect. Common dimensions are 8' x 14' and 8' x 16'. Thicknesses vary between suppliers from 4.5” to a full 6”. Swamp mats are produced by many small and medium-sized manufacturers, and quality varies dramatically within the industry.

Rig mats, another variety of access mats, may also known as [[wood]] and [[steel]] mats or steel frame mats. These mats are commonly made of [[spruce]], [[pine]], [[fir]] or a combination thereof encased in a steel frame,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://albertarigmats.com/faq/ |title=Alberta Rig Mats FAQ|access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some suppliers also offer [[bamboo]] and [[fibreglass]] options. The frame is normally [[I-beam |I Beam]] or HST steel. The steel is used to strengthen the mats, enabling the manufacturers of the mats to build them in larger sizes and to support more weight compared to all other types of mats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://industrialmatting.com/steel-rig-mats/ |title=Steel Rig Mats|access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common sizes are 8' x 20', 8' x 30', and 8' x 40'. One great advantage is the ease of repairing the wooden inserts which gives new life to an already long lasting and durable mat. This method of repair can be completed on both I Beam and HST style mats.

Mud mats are a combination of a reinforced member (such as metal bars or bamboo) confining geosynthetic fabric in a portable mat, that can be rolled up for ease of transport and deployment. A lightweight, light-duty flexible mat suitable for distributing loads over firm ground to avoid [[Rut_(roads) |rutting]]. They are not commonly used for access matting in soft ground conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.paradoxaccess.com/matting/mud-mats/|title=Mud Mats|access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heavy-Equipment Mats===
The final category of matting is known as Heavy-Equipment matting. These mats are constructed from the most durable, load-bearing materials, designed to be transited by heavy equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.paradoxaccess.com/matting/heavy-equipment-mat/ |title= Heavy Equipment Mats – Heavy Equipment Mats for Platform Stabilization Under Extreme Static Loadings |access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One variety of heavy-equipment mat is the [[Crane_(machine)|Crane]] mat. Designed for exceptionally heavy use, Crane mats (also known as digging mats, logging mats, or bridge mats)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.rig-mat.ca/crane-mats |title=Crane Mats|access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used in a wide variety of applications, including:

*Powerline tower assembly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://signaturecorp.com/construction/transmission-distribution/ |title= Establish Access to Work Sites in Extreme Conditions with Our Strong, Durable Construction Mats |access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mining]] and heavy access roads
*Module yards, pipe yards, [[Oil_terminal|tank farms]] and [[staging area]]s
*[[Wind farm]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sterlingcranemats.com/wind-power/|title=Wind Power &amp; Turbine Installations|access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bridge]] repair and construction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midwestaccesssolutions.com/water-crossing/|title=Water Crossings for Creeks, Streams, Canals, Ditches, Saturated Ground or other Obstacles|access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pier]]s and [[Wharf|wharves]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=Crane mat used as trestle work for pier construction|medium=YouTube|publisher=Justin Thelin Crane Mats|date=23 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crane mats are constructed of solid 8”, 10” or 12” timbers and are affixed by steel [[Bolt_(fastener)|bolts]], providing ground stabilization under extreme weight. The timber species used in these mats is generally [[Douglas fir]] and [[Tsuga|Hemlock]] as this species of wood has superior strength, durability and resiliency characteristics compared to other western softwood. The construction process of these mats allows for versatility as different size, length and quantity of timbers can be used to make different dimension mats. Most crane mat manufacturers are in the Western states and provinces. 
Repurposing a Crane mat with cable loops allows them to be relocated on site by client-owned equipment, allowing a client to minimize the number of mats they require. This repurposing transforms a Crane mat into a Digging mat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.paradoxaccess.com/matting/digging-mats/ |title=Digging Mats|access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logging mats are Crane mats with a reinforced slot which allows knuckle boom loaders or [[ Skid-steer_loader|skid-steer loaders]] to move the mats with ease.
Oilfield Mat Combos are heavy-duty steel frame mats designed to provide spill containment and platform matting.

==Construction materials==
Depending on purpose, mats may be constructed of any of the following materials:

===Wood===
[[Wood]] is the most commonly used matting material used. Wooden mats range widely in cost, depending on the type of wood used, and may be constructed of:
*[[Hardwood]]: hardwood is an imprecise term used in the matting industry, though it generally refers to any wood with a [[Janka_hardness_test|Janka Hardness Test]] rating at or above [[red oak]].
*[[Oak]]
*Fir&lt;ref name=envmats&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.envmats.ca|title=Innovative Design Increases Durability}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hybrid or [[Spruce-pine-fir|SPF]]: in essence is a Fir mat with outside edge boards made of Oak. Oak boards are there to mitigate outer edge damages from the [[Grapple_(tool)|grapple]] used to place mats, as oak is much harder than fir. These mats are also low-cost, primarily used for leveling under drilling rigs, camps and tank farms. 
*Spruce: spruce is often used as a “throw away” (one-time use) mat. It’s an inexpensive material with low [[Bearing_capacity|load bearing capacity]], [[durability]] and lifespan compared to fir and hardwood access mats.
*Bamboo: bamboo mats are a composite of [[Glued_laminated_timber|glue-laminated]] bamboo strips, offering higher [[Ultimate_tensile_strength|tensile strength]] than steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.paradoxaccess.com/matting/bamboo-mats/ |title=Bamboo mats? Tell me more!|access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composite===
[[Composite_material|composite]] mats are constructed of multiple materials, to improve the strength or durability of the mat. They can be more expensive upfront, but as they have a much longer lifespan than wooden mats they can be more cost-efficient. Higher quality versions of the composite mat will include [[anti-static]] and/or [[UV protection]] additives to prevent the formation of sparks from [[static electricity]] and to prevent cracking, physical breakdown &amp; fading of the mat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.constructionbusinessowner.com/safety/safety/january-2017-strategies-conquer-poor-ground-conditions |title= Strategies to Conquer Poor Ground Conditions |date= January 17, 2017 |last= Miniat |first=Bill|publisher=Construction Business Owner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composite mats feature a variety of connection mechanisms, from complicated systems that use small parts and specialized tools to large aluminum cam lock systems. 

Composite mats range in size from 4’ x 4’ to 8’ x 14’.  It is commonly thought that bigger is better with access mats, but it is important that the mats can be shipped by standard means. 7.5’ x 14’ composite mats, for example, will fit into an ISO container.

Examples of composite materials used in access matting include:

====Fibreglass====
[[Fibreglass]] offers high strength, long-term durability and is light weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.paradoxaccess.com/matting/fibreglass-mats/ |title= Fibreglass Mats – Innovation in Steel Frame Rig Mat Decking; Traditional Light-Duty Use |access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rubber====
[[Synthetic_rubber|Rubber]] mats evolved by industries seeking sustainable products made from recycled materials. The [[crumb rubber|rubber crumb]] [[tire recycling|recycled]] from [[scrap tires]] is a primary petroleum based material.

Depending on the site soil conditions, there are various thicknesses of mats that can be manufactured. The base material of the rubber mat is crumb rubber, [[Polyurethane|urethane]], and fibre from recycled motor [[vehicle tire]]s. The production of one typical mat uses up to 350 tires which makes the product [[environmentally friendly]]. The mats are moulded into conventional 8’x14’ sections and the body has an embedded patented&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eco-flex.com/products/index.php?productId=125&amp;rigmat_product=true Eco-Flex®]&lt;/ref&gt; rigid spine which makes each mat extremely durable and virtually indestructible. The surface is textured and designed to provide excellent traction for all types of traffic and have been proven to be a viable and economical solution for long term use under some of the most unruly site conditions and usages across North America. They are effective when used as access roads, heli-pads, laydown areas, wash pads or sidewalks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.paradoxaccess.com/matting/rubber-mats/|title=Rubber Matting and Rubber Sidewalks|access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubber mats are also known as blast mats in the mining industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.blastmat.com.au/application/|title=Blast mats: Other applications|access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plastic (HDPE)====
Engineered, hollow rig matting systems may be made up of [[High-density_polyethylene|High-Density Polyethylene]] (HDPE).  When compared to traditional wooden matting, composite mats are lighter in weight yet still can handle heavy loads&lt;ref name=tufftrack /&gt;. 

====Plastic (UHMWPE)====
This solid plastic, UHMWPE ([[Ultra-high-molecular-weight_polyethylene|Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene]]), offers the highest impact strength while being highly resistant to [[Corrosive_substance|corrosive chemicals]].&lt;ref name=tufftrack&gt;{{cite web| url= https://tufftrak-safety.com/advantages-technology/ |title=Advantages &amp; Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solid, one-piece compression moulded mats are made from recycled or virgin (HDPE) as well as recycled or virgin Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE).   

Solid mats are lighter in weight than hollow mats but due to the simpler connection system provide the same or similar usable working surface area per mat once connected (10’ x 8’, 13.5’ x 6.5’). Typically this means that a significantly greater number of solid mats can be loaded onto a truck resulting in a number of key benefits including larger working surface area per truckload, reduced number of transport trips per project, reduced fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions per project, and reduced transport costs per project.

A simple connection system, using standard connectors and tools, is used which means that mats can easily be installed and connected on undulating as well as flat surfaces, avoiding the need to prepare the ground surface in advance of installation.  This also results in project time and cost-savings.
Unlike hollow mats, solid mats cannot be punctured and therefore do not take on water (which can increase mat weight) or other fluids (such as fuel or chemicals) that could have an adverse environmental impact on sensitive sites.

==Uses==
Access matting has a variety of industrial and commercial uses, ranging from temporary, one-time use (for example, in the construction of pipeline access, where the mats are essentially destroyed in the process), reused over multiple projects over multiple seasons, or semi-permanent.

Access mats may also be used in other, non-traditional settings, such as providing access for cattle to [[Watering_trough|water troughs]] where muddy conditions may prove detrimental to the livestock;&lt;ref name=pipeline&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.paradoxaccess.com/matting/pipeline-mats/ |title= Pipeline Mats – The Epitome of Heavy-Duty Rugged Access Mat Use! |access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for home owners who need access to buildings under construction before driveways are poured; to create temporary parking;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ground-guards.co.uk/case-studies/parking-for-250-cars-at-siemens/|title=Parking for 250 cars at Siemens|access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to provide nature enthusiasts with a low-impact, environmental trailway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.albertatrailnet.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012_TrailTracker_4-web.pdf| title=Paradox Access Solutions Donates Rig Mats for Trails|access-date=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installation and Removal==
In some jurisdictions, access mats must be removed when they are no longer needed due to climactic conditions. Most access mat providers contract to remove used mats, which may then be re-rented, stored, or destroyed, depending on condition. Destruction of mats includes [[Woodchipper|chipping]]/mulching, chipping and burying in approved locations, or chipping and incinerating.&lt;ref name=pipeline /&gt;

August 1911. The starboard-side "shoulder-yoke" structure for aileron control is visible beside the seated pilot.]]

The '''Aerial Experiment Association''' (AEA) was a Canadian-American aeronautical research group formed on 30 September 1907, under the leadership of Dr. [[Alexander Graham Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;Milberry 1979, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AEA produced several different aircraft in quick succession, with each member acting as principal designer for at least one. The group introduced key technical innovations, notably wingtip [[aileron]]s and the [[Tricycle gear|tricycle landing gear]].

According to Bell, the AEA was a "co-operative scientific association, not for gain but for the love of the art and doing what we can to help one another."&lt;ref name="Milberry 13"&gt;Milberry 1979, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the association had no significant commercial impact, one of its members, [[Glenn Curtiss]], later established the large and successful aeronautical manufacturing company [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company]]. The AEA was disbanded on 31 March 1909.

==Origins==

The AEA came into being when [[John Alexander Douglas McCurdy]] and his friend [[Frederick Walker Baldwin|Frederick W. "Casey" Baldwin]], two recent engineering graduates of the [[University of Toronto]], decided to spend the summer in [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia]]. McCurdy had grown up there, and his father was the personal secretary of Dr. Bell. He had grown up close to the Bell family and was well received in their home. One day, as the three sat with Dr. Bell discussing the problems of aviation, [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard|Mabel Bell]], Alexander's wife, suggested they create a formal research group to exploit their collective ideas. Being independently wealthy, she provided a total of US$35,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|35000|1908|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} to finance the Association, with $20,000 made available immediately by the sale of property.&lt;ref name="Gillis"&gt;Gillis, Rannie. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080929215757/http://www.capebretonpost.com/index.cfm?sid=175549&amp;sc=150 "Mabel Bell Was A Focal Figure In The First Flight of the Silver Dart."] ''Cape Breton Post,'' 29 September 2008.

Retrieved: 24 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toward-1984"&gt;Toward 1984, pp. 141–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtiss, the American motorcycle designer and manufacturer and a recognized expert on [[gasoline engine]]s, was recruited as a member of the association, and his associate [[Augustus Post]] assisted as representative from the Aero Club of America. Curtiss had visited the [[Wright brothers]] to discuss [[aeronautical engineering]] and offered them use of a 50&amp;nbsp;hp engine. Wilbur cordially declined, saying that a motor of their own development met their power needs, unaware that the AEA was about to become a serious competitor in powered flight. Bell wrote to U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to have an interested young officer who had volunteered his help, US Army Lieutenant [[Thomas Selfridge]], officially detailed to Baddeck. Selfridge was assigned to the [[Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps]] on 3 August 1907, two days after its formation, and was sent to Nova Scotia. A year later, on 17 September 1908, while riding as a passenger with Orville Wright on a demonstration flight for the U.S. Army, he became the first person killed in an aircraft accident.

==First experiments==
In 1898, Bell experimented with [[tetrahedral kite]]s and wings constructed of multiple compound tetrahedral kites covered in maroon silk.{{#tag:ref|Bell was inspired in part by Australian aeronautical engineer [[Lawrence Hargrave]]'s work with man-carrying box kites.&lt;ref&gt;''Technical Gazette'', New South Wales, 1924, p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt; Hargrave declined to take patents on his inventions, similar to Bell's decision not to file patents on some of his inventions. Bell also chose maroon-colored silk as it would show up clearly against the light-colored sky in his photographic studies.|group="N"}} The tetrahedral wings were named ''Cygnet'' I, II and III, and were flown both unmanned and manned (''Cygnet I'' crashed during a flight carrying Selfridge) in the period from 1907–1912. Some of Bell's kites are on display at the [[Streets named after Alexander Graham Bell|Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ns1763.ca/victco/bellmusbbm.html "Nova Scotia's Electric Scrapbook."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417080338/http://ns1763.ca/victco/bellmusbbm.html |date=2009-04-17 }} ''ns1763.ca''.

==Later AEA designs==
[[File:Aerial Experiment Association gathered in 1909 with the AEA June Bug.jpg|thumb|Aerial Experiment Association members Casey Baldwin, Tom Selfridge, Glenn Curtiss, Alexander Graham Bell, John McCurdy and Augustus Post serving as observer from Aero Club of America.]]
The AEA's work progressed to heavier-than-air machines, applying their knowledge of kites to gliders. The AEA collaboration led to very public success. Casey Baldwin became the first Canadian and first British subject pilot on 12 March 1908 flight of ''[[AEA Red Wing|Red Wing]]''.&lt;ref name="Milberry 13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Casey 1981, pp. 8–11"&gt;Casey 1981, pp. 8–11.&lt;/ref&gt; {{#tag:ref| Quote: "Professor Alexander Graham Bell's New Machine, Built After Plans by Lieutenant Selfridge, Shown to Be Practicable by Flight Over [[Keuka Lake]]. Portion of Tail Gives Way, Bringing the Test to an End. Views of an Expert. [[Hammondsport, New York]], 12 March 1908. Professor Alexander Graham Bell's new aeroplane, the [[AEA Red Wing|''Red Wing'']], was given its test flight over Lake Keuka today by [[F. W. Baldwin]], the engineer in charge of its construction. The machine was built by the Aerial Experiment Association for Lieut. [[Thomas Selfridge]], U.S.A."&lt;ref&gt;"Selfridge Aerodrome Sails Steadily for 319 Feet. At 25 to 30 miles an Hour. First Public Trip of Heavier-than-air Car in America." ''[[Washington Post]],'' 13 May 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}}

Its successor, ''[[AEA White Wing|White Wing]]'', also of 1908, was the first airplane to have Bell's [[aileron]]s.&lt;ref name="Casey 1981, pp. 12–15"&gt;Casey 1981, pp. 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The following design, the [[AEA June Bug|''June Bug'']], also of 1908 and piloted by Curtiss, won the [[Scientific American]] Trophy by making the first official one kilometer flight in North America,&lt;ref name="Casey 1981, pp. 16–23"&gt;Casey 1981, pp. 16–23.&lt;/ref&gt; although, the [[Wright brothers|Wrights]] had already accomplished this in 1904.

Their fourth flying machine, the [[AEA Silver Dart|''Silver Dart'']], also constructed in 1908, made the first controlled powered flight in Canada on 23 February 1909 when it was flown off the ice of [[Bras d'Or Lake]] near Baddeck by McCurdy, who had been one of its designers.&lt;ref name="Casey 1981, pp. 28–33"&gt;Casey 1981, pp. 28–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 1977, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 March 1909, McCurdy set a record when he flew the ''Silver Dart'' on a circular course over a distance of more than {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}}, a feat that the Wrights had already accomplished in 1905. The Association made the first passenger flight in Canada on 2 August, also in the ''Silver Dart''.

Much development also took place in [[Hammondsport, New York]], where in 1908 pioneering experimentation was done on [[seaplane]] carried out by Curtiss.&lt;ref&gt;Casey 1981, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In France [[Henri Fabre]] successfully flew the first powered seaplane in history, the [[Fabre Hydravion]], in March 1910.

==Organization's dissolution==

Bell's organization was established with a fixed term mandate, which was extended to March 31, 1909, by joint agreement of all its members, with Mrs. Bell contributing an additional $10,000 of financing.&lt;ref&gt;Casey 1981, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; After Lt. Selfridge's death in September 1908, McCurdy became the organization's secretary and Dr. Bell's cousin, Charles J. Bell, became the Association's legal trustee.

After Curtiss unexpectedly formed a new commercial aircraft building venture, the Herring-Curtiss Company, in March 1909, strained relations arose between Curtiss and the Association's other members.&lt;ref&gt;Casey 1981, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; A request for him to attend the association's meeting and resolve the issue went unanswered, and the organization's mandate was not extended a second time. The AEA was disbanded on 31 March 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 1977, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Casey 1981, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BCT Network2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|BCT Network]]

The [[United States Army|Army]] will continue the development and fielding of an incremental ground tactical network capability to all Army [[brigade combat team]]s. This network is a layered system of [[Interconnection|interconnected]] computers and software, radios, and sensors within the Brigade Combat Team (BCT). The BCT network is essential to enable Unified Battle Command and will be delivered to the Army's Brigade Combat Teams in increasing capability increments. The first increment is currently finishing SDD developmental and operational testing and will be delivered to Infantry Brigade Combat Teams in the form of Network Integration Kits (B-kits) with E-IBCT.

The soldier at every echelon, from Brigade to Squad, will be connected to the proper sensor data and communication relays to ensure proper battlespace [[Situation awareness|situational awareness]].

== The Network Integration Kit ==
The Network Integration Kit (NIK) is a suite of equipment capable of being installed on many vehicles including [[Humvee|HMMWV's]] and [[MRAP|MRAP's]]. It provides the Network connectivity and [[battle command]] software to integrate and fuse sensor data into the [[common operational picture]] (COP) displayed on the [[Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below|Force XXI Battle Command Battalion/Brigade and Below]] (FBCB2). The Network Integration Kit consists of an integrated computer system (ICS) that hosts the Battle Command software and the Systems of Systems Common Operating Environment (SOSCOE) software, along with the [[Joint Tactical Radio System|JTRS]] GMR radio to provide the interface to the sensors and unmanned systems, as well as voice and data communications with other vehicles and soldiers.

Soldiers will be able to communicate with the Battalion [[Tactical operations center|Tactical Operation Center]] (TOC), by sending reports on enemy sighting, activity and location utilizing the NIK via the Network allowing for split-time tactical decisions.

==History==
BigCommerce was founded in 2009 by Australians Eddie Machaalani and Mitchell Harper following a chance meeting in an online chatroom in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warner|first1=Andrew|title=BigCommerce: How Two Programmers Who Met In A Chat Room Bootstrapped A $10 Mil eCommerce Company – With Mitchell Harper|url=http://mixergy.com/interviews/mitchell-harper-interspire-interview/|website=Mixergy|date=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ryall|first1=Jenni|title=2 Aussies who met in a chat room created a start-up valued at $500 million|url=http://mashable.com/2014/11/19/bigcommerce-50-million-funding/|website=Mashable|date=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, the two relaunched a hosted version of Interspire Shopping Cart called “BigCommerce”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Mitchell|title=Interspire Shopping Cart Hosted (BigCommerce) Pricing Integrated with Interspire.com|url=http://www.interspire.com/content/2009/11/04/interspire-shopping-cart-hosted-bigcommerce-pricing-integrated-with-interspire-com/|date=4 November 2009|access-date=2015-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622073001/http://www.interspire.com/content/2009/11/04/interspire-shopping-cart-hosted-bigcommerce-pricing-integrated-with-interspire-com/|archive-date=2015-06-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened its first U.S. office.

A '''blowout preventer (BOP)''' is a large, specialized [[valve]] or similar mechanical device, used to seal, control and monitor [[oil well|oil]] and gas wells to prevent [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowouts]], the uncontrolled release of crude oil and/or natural gas from a well.  They are usually installed in stacks of other valves.

Blowout preventers were developed to cope with extreme erratic pressures and uncontrolled flow ([[Blowout (well drilling)#Formation kick|formation kick]]) emanating from a [[Petroleum reservoir|well reservoir]] during drilling.  Kicks can lead to a potentially catastrophic event known as a blowout.  In addition to controlling the downhole (occurring in the drilled hole) pressure and the flow of oil and gas, blowout preventers are intended to prevent tubing (e.g. drill pipe and [[Casing (borehole)|well casing]]), tools and drilling fluid from being blown out of the wellbore (also known as bore hole, the hole leading to the reservoir) when a blowout threatens.  Blowout preventers are critical to the safety of crew, [[drilling rig|rig]] (the equipment system used to drill a wellbore) and environment, and to the monitoring and maintenance of well integrity; thus blowout preventers are intended to provide [[fail-safe]]ty to the systems that include them.

The term '''BOP''' (pronounced B-O-P, not "bop") is used in [[List of acronyms in oil and gas exploration and production|oilfield vernacular]] to refer to blowout preventers. The abbreviated term '''preventer''', usually prefaced by a type (e.g. [[Blowout preventer#Ram blowout preventer|ram preventer]]), is used to refer to a single blowout preventer unit.  A blowout preventer may also simply be referred to by its type (e.g. ram).

The terms '''blowout preventer''', '''blowout preventer stack''' and '''blowout preventer system''' are commonly used interchangeably and in a general manner to describe an assembly of several stacked blowout preventers of varying type and function, as well as auxiliary components.  A typical subsea deepwater blowout preventer system includes components such as electrical and [[hydraulics|hydraulic lines]], control pods, hydraulic accumulators, test valve, kill and choke lines and valves, [[drilling riser|riser joint]], hydraulic connectors, and a support frame.

Two categories of blowout preventer are most prevalent: ''[[Blowout preventer#Ram blowout preventer|ram]]'' and ''[[Blowout preventer#Annular blowout preventer|annular]]''.  BOP stacks frequently utilize both types, typically with at least one annular BOP stacked above several ram BOPs.

(A related valve, called an ''inside blowout preventer'', ''internal blowout preventer'', or ''IBOP'', is positioned within, and restricts flow up, the drillpipe.  This article does not address inside blowout preventer use.)

Blowout preventers are used on land wells, offshore rigs, and subsea wells.  Land and subsea BOPs are secured to the top of the wellbore, known as the wellhead.  BOPs on offshore rigs are mounted below the rig deck.  Subsea BOPs are connected to the offshore rig above by a drilling riser that provides a continuous pathway for the drill string and fluids emanating from the wellbore.  In effect, a riser extends the wellbore to the rig. Unfortunately, blowout preventers do not always function correctly. An example of this is the [[Deepwater Horizon]] blowout, where the pipe line going through the BOP was slightly bent and the BOP failed to cut the pipe.

==Use==

Blowout preventers come in a variety of styles, sizes and pressure ratings. Several individual units serving various functions are combined to compose a blowout preventer stack.  Multiple blowout preventers of the same type are frequently provided for [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]], an important factor in the effectiveness of [[fail-safe]] devices.

The primary functions of a blowout preventer system are to:
* Confine well fluid to the [[wellbore]];
* Provide means to add fluid to the wellbore;
* Allow controlled volumes of fluid to be withdrawn from the wellbore.

Additionally, and in performing those primary functions, blowout preventer systems are used to:
* Regulate and monitor wellbore pressure;
* Center and hang off the [[drill string]] in the wellbore;
* Shut in the well (e.g. seal the void, [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]],  between drillpipe and casing);
* [[Well kill|“Kill” the well]] (prevent the flow of [[formation fluid]], influx, from the reservoir into the wellbore) ;
* Seal the [[wellhead]] (close off the wellbore);
* Sever the [[Casing (borehole)|casing]] or [[drill pipe]] (in case of emergencies).

In drilling a typical high-pressure well, drill strings are routed through a blowout preventer stack toward the [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoir]] of oil and gas.  As the well is drilled, [[drilling fluid]], "mud", is fed through the drill string down to the drill bit, "blade", and returns up the wellbore in the ring-shaped void, [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]], between the outside of the drill pipe and the [[Casing (borehole)|casing]] (piping that lines the wellbore).  The column of drilling mud exerts downward [[Fluid statics#Hydrostatic pressure|hydrostatic pressure]] to counter opposing pressure from the formation being drilled, allowing drilling to proceed.

When a [[Blowout (well drilling)#Formation kick|kick]] (influx of [[formation fluid]]) occurs, rig operators or automatic systems close the blowout preventer units, sealing the annulus to stop the flow of fluids out of the wellbore.  Denser mud is then circulated into the wellbore down the drill string, up the annulus and out through the choke line at the base of the BOP stack through chokes (flow restrictors) until downhole pressure is overcome.  Once “kill weight” mud extends from the bottom of the well to the top, the well has been “killed”.  If the integrity of the well is intact drilling may be resumed.  Alternatively, if circulation is not feasible it may be possible to kill the well by "[[Well kill#Bullheading|bullheading]]", forcibly pumping, in the heavier mud from the top through the kill line connection at the base of the stack.  This is less desirable because of the higher surface pressures likely needed and the fact that much of the mud originally in the annulus must be forced into receptive formations in the open hole section beneath the deepest casing shoe.

If the blowout preventers and mud do not restrict the upward pressures of a kick, a blowout results, potentially shooting tubing, oil and gas up the wellbore, damaging the rig, and leaving [[well integrity]] in question.

Since BOPs are important for the safety of the crew and natural environment, as well as the [[drilling rig]] and the wellbore itself, authorities recommend, and regulations require, that BOPs be regularly inspected, tested and refurbished. Tests vary from daily test of functions on critical wells to monthly or less frequent testing on wells with low likelihood of control problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=blowout%20preventer
 |title=Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary |accessdate=2007-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploitable reservoirs of oil and gas are increasingly rare and remote, leading to increased subsea deepwater well exploration and requiring BOPs to remain submerged for as long as a year in extreme conditions{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}.  As a result, BOP assemblies have grown larger and heavier (e.g. a single ram-type BOP unit can weigh in excess of 30,000 pounds), while the space allotted for BOP stacks on existing offshore rigs has not grown commensurately.  Thus a key focus in the technological development of BOPs over the last two decades has been limiting their footprint and weight while simultaneously increasing safe operating capacity.

==Types==
BOPs come in two basic types, ''ram'' and ''annular''. Both are often used together in [[Drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rig]] BOP stacks, typically with at least one annular BOP capping a stack of several ram BOPs.

===Ram blowout preventer===
[[File:Cameron Ram-type Blowout Preventer (1922).jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cameron Ram-type Blowout Preventer (1922)|Patent Drawing of the Original Ram-type Blowout Preventer, by Cameron Iron Works (1922)]].]]

[[File:Blowout Preventer.svg|thumb|right|Blowout Preventer diagram showing different types of rams. (a) blind ram (b) pipe ram and (c) shear ram.]]

The [[Cameron Ram-type Blowout Preventer (1922)|ram BOP]] was invented by James Smither Abercrombie and Harry S. Cameron in 1922, and was brought to market in 1924 by [[Cameron International Corporation|Cameron Iron Works]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.asme.org/Communities/History/Landmarks/First_RamType_Blowout.cfm

A ram-type BOP is similar in operation to a [[gate valve]], but uses a pair of opposing steel plungers, rams.  The rams extend toward the center of the wellbore to restrict flow or retract open in order to permit flow.  The inner and top faces of the rams are fitted with packers (elastomeric seals) that press against each other, against the wellbore, and around tubing running through the wellbore.  Outlets at the sides of the BOP housing (body) are used for connection to choke and kill lines or valves.

Rams, or ram blocks, are of four common types: ''pipe'', ''blind'', ''shear'', and ''blind shear''.

'''Pipe rams''' close around a drill pipe, restricting flow in the annulus (ring-shaped space between concentric objects) between the outside of the drill pipe and the wellbore, but do not obstruct flow within the drill pipe.  Variable-bore pipe rams can accommodate tubing in a wider range of outside diameters than standard pipe rams, but typically with some loss of pressure capacity and longevity. Pipe ram should not be closed if there is no pipe in the hole.

'''Blind rams''' (also known as sealing rams), which have no openings for tubing, can close off the well when the well does not contain a drill string or other tubing, and seal it.

[[File:Varco Schaffer Ram BOP Stack.jpg|thumb|right|Patent Drawing of a Varco Shaffer Ram BOP Stack. A shear ram BOP has cut the drillstring and a pipe ram has hung it off.]]

[[File:Shear cutter blades grey.png|thumb|left|Schematic view of closing shear blades]]

'''Shear rams''' are designed to shear the pipe in the well and seal the wellbore simultaneously. It has steel blades to shear the pipe and seals to seal the annulus after shearing the pipe.

'''Blind shear rams''' (also known as shear seal rams, or sealing shear rams) are intended to seal a wellbore, even when the bore is occupied by a drill string, by cutting through the drill string as the rams close off the well.  The upper portion of the severed drill string is freed from the ram, while the lower portion may be crimped and the “fish tail” captured to hang the drill string off the BOP.

In addition to the standard ram functions, variable-bore pipe rams are frequently used as test rams in a modified blowout preventer device known as a stack test valve.  Stack test valves are positioned at the bottom of a BOP stack and resist downward pressure (unlike BOPs, which resist upward pressures).  By closing the test ram and a BOP ram about the drillstring and pressurizing the annulus, the BOP is pressure-tested for proper function.

The original ram BOPs of the 1920s were simple and rugged manual devices with minimal parts.  The BOP housing (body) had a vertical well bore and horizontal ram cavity (ram guide chamber).  Opposing rams (plungers) in the ram cavity translated horizontally, actuated by threaded ram shafts (piston rods) in the manner of a screw jack.  Torque from turning the ram shafts by wrench or hand wheel was converted to linear motion and the rams, coupled to the inner ends of the ram shafts, opened and closed the well bore.  Such screw jack type operation provided enough mechanical advantage for rams to overcome downhole pressures and seal the wellbore annulus.

Hydraulic rams BOPs were in use by the 1940s.  Hydraulically actuated blowout preventers had many potential advantages.  The pressure could be equalized in the opposing hydraulic cylinders causing the rams to operate in unison.  Relatively rapid actuation and remote control were facilitated, and hydraulic rams were well-suited to high pressure wells.

Because BOPs are depended on for safety and reliability, efforts to minimize the complexity of the devices are still employed to ensure longevity.  As a result, despite the ever-increasing demands placed on them, state of the art ram BOPs are conceptually the same as the first effective models, and resemble those units in many ways.

Ram BOPs for use in deepwater applications universally employ hydraulic actuation.  Threaded shafts are often still incorporated into hydraulic ram BOPs as lock rods that hold the ram in position after hydraulic actuation.  By using a mechanical ram locking mechanism, constant hydraulic pressure need not be maintained.  Lock rods may be coupled to ram shafts or not, depending on manufacturer.  Other types of ram locks, such as wedge locks, are also used.

Typical ram actuator assemblies (operator systems) are secured to the BOP housing by removable bonnets.  Unbolting the bonnets from the housing allows BOP maintenance and facilitates the substitution of rams.  In that way, for example, a pipe ram BOP can be converted to a blind shear ram BOP.

Shear-type ram BOPs require the greatest closing force in order to cut through tubing occupying the wellbore.  Boosters (auxiliary hydraulic actuators) are frequently mounted to the outer ends of a BOP’s hydraulic actuators to provide additional shearing force for shear rams.

Ram BOPs are typically designed so that well pressure will help maintain the rams in their closed, sealing position.  That is achieved by allowing fluid to pass through a channel in the ram and exert pressure at the ram’s rear and toward the center of the wellbore.  Providing a channel in the ram also limits the thrust required to overcome well bore pressure.

Single ram and double ram BOPs are commonly available.  The names refer to the quantity of ram cavities (equivalent to the effective quantity of valves) contained in the unit.  A double ram BOP is more compact and lighter than a stack of two single ram BOPs while providing the same functionality, and is thus desirable in many applications.  Triple ram BOPs are also manufactured, but not as common.

Technological development of ram BOPs has been directed towards deeper and higher pressure wells, greater reliability, reduced maintenance, facilitated replacement of components, facilitated [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] intervention, reduced [[hydraulic fluid]] consumption, and improved connectors, packers, seals, locks and rams.  In addition, limiting BOP weight and footprint are significant concerns to account for the limitations of existing rigs.

The highest-capacity large-bore ram blowout preventer on the market, as of July 2010, Cameron’s EVO 20K BOP, has a hold-pressure rating of 20,000 psi, ram force in excess of 1,000,000 pounds, and a well bore diameter of 18.75&amp;nbsp;inches.

===Annular blowout preventer===

[[File:Original Shaffer Spherical BOP Patent1.jpg|thumb|right|Patent Drawing of Original Shaffer Spherical-type Blowout Preventer (1972)]]

[[File:Annular BOP.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of an Annular blowout preventer in open and fully closed configurations. The flexible annulus (donut) in blue is forced into the drillpipe cavity by the hydraulic pistons.]]

The annular blowout preventer was invented by [[Granville Sloan Knox]] in 1946; a U.S. patent for it was awarded in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|US|2609836}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often around the rig it is called the "Hydril", after the name of one of the manufacturers of such devices.

An annular-type blowout preventer can close around the drill string, casing or a non-cylindrical object, such as the [[kelly drive|kelly]].  Drill pipe including the larger-diameter tool joints (threaded connectors) can be "stripped" (i.e., moved vertically while pressure is contained below) through an annular preventer by careful control of the hydraulic closing pressure. Annular blowout preventers are also effective at maintaining a seal around the drillpipe even as it rotates during drilling. Regulations typically require that an annular preventer be able to completely close a wellbore, but annular preventers are generally not as effective as ram preventers in maintaining a seal on an open hole.  Annular BOPs are typically located at the top of a BOP stack, with one or two annular preventers positioned above a series of several ram preventers.

An annular blowout preventer uses the principle of a [[Wedge (mechanical device)|wedge]] to shut in the wellbore.  It has a donut-like rubber seal, known as an [[elastomer]]ic packing unit, reinforced with steel ribs.  The packing unit is situated in the BOP housing between the head and hydraulic piston.  When the piston is actuated, its upward thrust forces the packing unit to constrict, like a [[sphincter]], sealing the annulus or openhole.  Annular preventers have only two moving parts, piston and packing unit, making them simple and easy to maintain relative to ram preventers.

The original type of annular blowout preventer uses a “wedge-faced” (conical-faced) piston.   As the piston rises, vertical movement of the packing unit is restricted by the head and the sloped face of the piston squeezes the packing unit inward, toward the center of the wellbore.

In 1972, Ado N. Vujasinovic was awarded a patent for a variation on the annular preventer known as a spherical blowout preventer, so-named because of its spherical-faced head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|US|3667721}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the piston rises the packing unit is thrust upward against the curved head, which constricts the packing unit inward.  Both types of annular preventer are in common use.

==Control methods==
When wells are drilled on land or in very shallow water where the wellhead is above the water line, BOPs are activated by hydraulic pressure from a remote accumulator.  Several control stations will be mounted around the rig.  They also can be closed manually by turning large wheel-like handles.

In deeper offshore operations with the wellhead just above the mudline on the sea floor, there are five primary ways by which a BOP can be controlled. The possible means are:{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}
* Hydraulic Control Signal:  sent from surface through a hydraulic umbilical;
* Electrical Control Signal: sent from the surface through a control cable;
* Acoustical Control Signal: sent from the surface based on a modulated/encoded pulse of sound transmitted by an underwater [[transducer]];
* [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] [[Well intervention|Intervention]]: remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) mechanically control valves and provide hydraulic pressure to the stack (via “hot stab” panels);
* [[Dead man's switch|Deadman Switch]] / Auto Shear: fail-safe activation of selected BOPs during an emergency, and if the control, power and hydraulic lines have been severed.

Two control pods are provided on the BOP for redundancy.  Electrical signal control of the pods is primary.  Acoustical, ROV intervention and dead-man controls are secondary.

An emergency disconnect system/sequence, or EDS, disconnects the rig from the well in case of an emergency.  The EDS is also intended to automatically trigger the deadman switch, which closes the BOP, kill and choke valves.  The EDS may be a subsystem of the BOP stack’s control pods or separate.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Pumps on the rig normally deliver pressure to the blowout preventer stack through hydraulic lines. Hydraulic accumulators are on the BOP stack enable closure of blowout preventers even if the BOP stack is disconnected from the rig.  It is also possible to trigger the closing of BOPs automatically based on too high pressure or excessive flow.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Individual wells along the U.S. coastline may also be required to have BOPs with backup acoustic control.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} General requirements of other nations, including Brazil, were drawn to require this method.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} BOPs featuring this method may cost as much as [[United States dollar|US$]]500,000 more than those that omit the feature.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

== Deepwater Horizon blowout ==
{{Main|Deepwater Horizon oil spill}}
[[Image:ROV Deepwater Horizon BOP.jpg|thumb|right|A robotic arm of a [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|Remotely Operated Vehicle]] (ROV) attempts to activate the "''Deepwater Horizon''" Blowout Preventer (BOP), Thursday, April 22, 2010.]]

During the [[Deepwater Horizon explosion|''Deepwater Horizon'' drilling rig explosion]] incident on April 20, 2010, the blowout preventer should have been activated automatically, cutting the drillstring and sealing the well to preclude a blowout and subsequent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, but it failed to fully engage. Underwater robots (ROVs) later were used to manually trigger the blind shear ram preventer, to no avail.

As of May 2010 it was unknown why the blowout preventer failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Oil Spill Points to Rig Fail-Safe as Utter Failure |author= Carl Franzen |work= AOL news |url= http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/oil-spill-debacle-points-to-rig-blowout-preventer-as-utter-failure/19461009 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100504013024/http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/oil-spill-debacle-points-to-rig-blowout-preventer-as-utter-failure/19461009 |archivedate= 2010-05-04 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief surveyor John David Forsyth of the [[American Bureau of Shipping]] testified in hearings before the Joint Investigation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.deepwaterinvestigation.com/ |title=Deepwater Horizon Joint Investigation Team official Web site |publisher=[[U.S. Coast Guard]] and [[Minerals Management Service]] |accessdate=2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Minerals Management Service]] and the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] investigating the causes of the explosion that his agency last inspected the rig's blowout preventer in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.nola.com/news/gulf-oil-spill/index.ssf/2010/05/hearings_rigs_blowout_prevente.html|title = Hearings: Rig's blowout preventer last inspected in 2005|publisher = Times-Picayune|author = David Hammer|date = 2010-05-26|accessdate = 2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; BP representatives suggested that the preventer could have suffered a hydraulic leak.&lt;ref name=fountain /&gt; Gamma-ray imaging of the preventer conducted on May 12 and May 13, 2010 showed that the preventer's internal valves were partially closed and were restricting the flow of oil.

The permit for the [[Macondo Prospect]] by the [[Minerals Management Service]] in 2009 did not require redundant acoustic control means.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704423504575212031417936798 Leaking Oil Well Lacked Safeguard Device] Wall Street Journal, 28 April 2010. Retrieved 3 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Inasmuch as the BOPs could not be closed successfully by underwater manipulation ([[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] [[Well intervention|Intervention]]), pending results of a complete investigation, it is uncertain whether this omission was a factor in the blowout.

Documents discussed during congressional hearings June 17, 2010, suggested that a battery in the device's control pod was flat and that the rig's owner, [[Transocean]], may have "modified" [[Cameron International Corporation|Cameron]]'s equipment for the Macondo site (including incorrectly routing hydraulic pressure to a stack test valve instead of a pipe ram BOP) which increased the risk of BOP failure, in spite of warnings from their contractor to that effect. Another hypothesis was that a junction in the drilling pipe may have been positioned in the BOP stack in such a way that its shear rams had an insurmountable thickness of material to cut through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Andrew|title=BP oil disaster puts spotlight on small Texan firm|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/18/bp-oil-disaster-cameron-international|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=19 June 2010|date=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was later discovered that a second piece of tubing got into the BOP stack at some point during the Macondo incident, potentially explaining the failure of the BOP shearing mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hammer|first=David|title=Discovery of second pipe in Deepwater Horizon riser stirs debate among experts|url=http://www.nola.com/news/gulf-oil-spill/index.ssf/2010/07/post_19.html|publisher=nola.com|accessdate=13 July 2010|date=09-07-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2010 it was unknown whether the tubing might have been casing that shot up through the well or perhaps broken drill pipe that dropped into the well. The DNV final report indicated that the second tube was the segment of the drill string that was ejected after being cut by the blow out preventer shears.

On July 10, 2010 BP began operations to install a sealing cap, also known as a capping stack, atop the failed blowout preventer stack.  Based on BP's video feeds of the operation the sealing cap assembly, called Top Hat 10, included a stack of three blind shear ram BOPs manufactured by Hydril (a GE Oil &amp; Gas company), one of Cameron's chief competitors.  By July 15 the 3 ram capping stack had sealed the Macondo well, if only temporarily, for the first time in 87 days.

The U.S. government wanted the failed blowout preventer to be replaced in case of any pressure change that occurs when the relief well intersected with the well.&lt;ref name="20100903BlowoutPreventerRemoved"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/09/03/crews-prepare-raise-failed-blowout-preventer-key-piece-evidence-bps-oil-spill/ |title=BP: Blowout preventer that failed to stop Gulf of Mexico oil leak removed from well  |publisher=FoxNews.com |agency=Associated Press |date=2010-09-03 |accessdate=2010-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 3, 2010, at 1:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. CDT the 300 [[ton]] failed blowout preventer was removed from the well and began being slowly lifted to the surface.&lt;ref name="20100903BlowoutPreventerRemoved"/&gt; Later that day a replacement blowout preventer was placed on the well.&lt;ref name="20100904BlowoutPreventerOnBoat"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/09/04/bp-crews-raising-blowout-preventer-gulf-face-delay-wait-hydrates-melt/ |title=Failed blowout preventer, a key piece of evidence in Gulf oil spill probe, secure on boat |publisher=FoxNews.com |agency=Associated Press |date=2010-09-04 |accessdate=2010-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 4 at 6:54&amp;nbsp;p.m. CDT the failed blowout preventer reached the surface of the water and at 9:16&amp;nbsp;p.m. CDT it was placed in a special container on board the vessel Helix Q4000.&lt;ref name="20100904BlowoutPreventerOnBoat"/&gt; The failed blowout preventer was taken to a NASA facility in Louisiana for examination&lt;ref name="20100904BlowoutPreventerOnBoat"/&gt; by [[Det Norske Veritas]] (DNV).

They did not suggest any failure of actuation as would be caused by faulty batteries. The upper section of the blow out preventer failed to separate as designed due to numerous oil leaks compromising hydraulic actuator operation, and this had to be cut free during recovery.

'''''Brainstorm''''' is a 1983 American [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Douglas Trumbull]], and starring [[Christopher Walken]], [[Natalie Wood]] (in her final film role), [[Louise Fletcher]] and [[Cliff Robertson]].

It follows a research team's efforts to perfect a system that directly records the sensory and emotional feelings of a subject, and the efforts by the company's management to exploit the device for military ends.

==Plot==
A team of scientists invent a [[brain-computer interface|brain/computer interface]] that allows sensations to be recorded from a person's brain and converted to tape so that others may experience them. The team includes estranged husband and wife Michael and Karen Brace, as well as Michael's colleague Lillian Reynolds. At CEO Alex Terson's instruction, the team demonstrates the device to investors in order to gain financing.

Karen dons the recorder while working with Michael and Lillian. When Michael plays the tape back, the group realizes that emotional experiences are also recorded. Michael tapes his memories of times with Karen, which he shares with her, and it leads to their reconciliation.

Lillian is pressured by backers to admit as a member of the team a former colleague, Landon Marks, whom she sees as part of the [[military-industrial complex]]. She disagrees with their plan to have the invention developed for military use.

One team member, Gordy Forbes, has sexual intercourse while wearing the recorder, and he shares the tape with colleagues, including Hal Abramson. Hal [[tape splicing|splices]] one section of the tape into a continuous orgasm, which results in sensory overload, leading to his forced retirement. Tensions increase as the possibilities for abuse become clear.

Already suffering from heart problems and a constant cigarette smoker, Lillian suffers a [[heart attack]] while working alone. Realizing that she is about to die, Lillian records her experience.

Following her funeral, Michael decides to experience Lillian's recording, but he nearly dies when the playback causes his body to simulate the sensations and effects of a heart attack. Michael modifies his console to filter the physical output, and he replays the tape.  Viewing Lillian's death experience, he sees [[Life review|"memory bubbles"]]—moments from Lillian's life. Michael experiences Lillian's memories of a humorous exchange with Michael as he plays with an [[industrial robot]], a surprise birthday party, and being devastated when Alex tells her that an earlier project has been cancelled.

A team of scientists wanting to discover the machine's military capabilities is monitoring the equipment as Michael plays Lillian's final tape. They have Gordy also experience the tape, but Landon ignored the advice of the monitoring staff that Michael has made modifications to his playback terminal. As such Gordy is killed offscreen for monitoring the tape unauthorized whilst Landon and the others watch on in surprise.

Michael's playback is cut short by Hal, but having witnessed a digital [[near-death experience]] makes Michael curious to see the entire tape. Alex has the recording locked away and tells Michael he will not be allowed to view it. When he returns to work, Michael walks in on Landon Marks and a team of outsider technicians going through his research records and protests to Alex who responds by firing Michael and Karen.

Michael attempts to hack into the lab's computers. Hal advises him to look under "Project Brainstorm", a program the military has created to re-develop their invention for torture and [[brainwashing]]. Michael and Karen's son Chris, wanting to experience the special device, is inadvertently exposed to one such tape, causing him to have a [[psychotic break|psychotic experience]] which results in his hospitalization—there Michael learns of Gordy's fate and deduces that Alex was behind his murder.

Rather than see his creation perverted, Michael vows to destroy his work and enlists the help of Karen and Hal. Michael and Karen head to the [[Pinehurst Resort]] and, realizing they are under surveillance, stage a fight that results in Karen leaving for Hal's house. As the two feign reconciliation over the phone, Michael accesses the Brainstorm computer via another phone line, while Karen hacks into the system and sabotages the robots that manufacture the interface terminals.

Karen shuts down the security system, locking the staff outside and enabling Michael to load Lillian's tape and experience it uninterrupted. With the plant in chaos, Robert Jenkins orders Michael's arrest. Michael escapes their agents and drives to a phone booth at the [[Wright Brothers National Memorial]]. He reconnects with the computers and accesses the final part of the tape, beyond the point of Lillian's physical death.

Karen leaves the house to meet with Michael. Hal and his wife, Wendy, send the last of Karen's commands to the company computers, shutting down the plant.

Karen arrives at the Wright Brothers Memorial while the tape is playing. Michael bears witness to the [[afterlife]], experiencing a brief vision of [[hell]] before traveling away from Earth and through the universe, even after the tape ends. He ultimately has visions of angels and departed souls flying into a great cosmic Light, which seems to be [[heaven]]. Michael then collapses. Karen sobs, believing him dead. She pleads for Michael to stay alive. Awakening from the experience, he weeps with joy and embraces Karen.

==Production==
To prepare for the film, Trumbull took most of the key cast and crew up to the [[Esalen Institute]], an experimental research facility in Northern California known for its new-age classes and workshops. In September 1981 the cast and crew traveled to North Carolina to begin six weeks of location shooting, before moving back to the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios]] in [[Culver City]], California in November to film interior scenes.&lt;ref name="TCM"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/309186%7C309216/Brainstorm.html|title= Brainstorm (TCM article)|first= Andrea |last= Passafiume|date= |work=TCM|publisher= Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natalie Wood's death===
The film was nearly scuttled by [[Natalie Wood]]'s death during a production break in November 1981. By this time, Wood had already completed all of her major scenes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thackrey| first= Ted Jr. |title=Actress Natalie Wood Dies| work=Los Angeles Times| date=November 30, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to mounting financial problems, MGM took Wood's death as an opportunity to shut down the already troubled production. "When she died," said Trumbull, "all the sets were locked and frozen on all the stages. No one could get in or out without special permission while all the negotiations took place."&lt;ref name="TCM" /&gt;

Trumbull believed that the financially strapped MGM simply got cold feet about putting up the rest of the money to complete ''Brainstorm''. "MGM's problem was that insurance institution [[Lloyd's of London]], when it took depositions from me and other people, realized that the film could be finished. Why should they pay an insurance claim for something that really wasn't damaged goods?" When MGM refused to pay for the film to be completed, Lloyd's of London provided $2.75 million for Trumbull to complete principal photography and an additional $3.5 million towards post-production. Meanwhile, other studios showed interest in buying ''Brainstorm'' from MGM to release as their own production. "MGM decided to allow Lloyd's of London to offer the film to many of the major studios in town," said Trumbull. "Several of them made bids to MGM. And the studio suddenly realized that a lot of other people in this town were excited about ''Brainstorm'', and were ready to put up millions of dollars. MGM figured they'd look like jerks if they let it go and it turned out to be a big success. So they finally decided to work out this deal where Lloyd's of London would put up the remaining money and become a profit participant."&lt;ref name="TCM" /&gt;

Trumbull proceeded to complete the film by rewriting the script and using Natalie Wood's younger sister for Wood's few remaining scenes.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/news/movie-memorials-hollywood-honors-fallen-171700659.html|title= Movie Memorials: How Hollywood Honors Its Fallen|first=Steven |last=Bryan|date= May 25, 2012 |work=Yahoo Movies|publisher= Yahoo!|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film carries the dedication credit "To Natalie".&lt;ref name="TCM" /&gt;

=== Effects ===
The film was conceived as an introduction to Trumbull's [[Showscan]] 60 frames-per-second [[70 mm film|70mm film]] process. "In movies people often do flashbacks and point-of-view shots as a gauzy, mysterious, distant kind of image," Trumbull recalled, "And I wanted to do just the opposite, which was to make the material of the mind even more real and high-impact than 'reality'".

However, MGM backed out of plans to release the experimental picture in the new format. Trumbull instead shot the virtual reality sequences in 24 frames-per-second [[Super Panavision 70]] with an aspect ratio of 2.2:1. The rest of the film was shot in conventional 35mm with an aspect ratio of approximately 1.7 to 1.&lt;ref name="jj3553"&gt;{{cite web

=== Soundtrack ===
The score to ''Brainstorm'' was composed and conducted by [[James Horner]], it won him the [[Saturn Award for Best Music]] in 1983. The ''[[Varèse Sarabande]]'' album/CD release is a re-recording with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], produced shortly before the original theatrical release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/brainstorm.html ''Brainstorm''] soundtrack review at Filmtracks.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Brainstorm'' was finally released on September 30, 1983, almost two years after Wood's death. However, it opened on a small number of screens and with little publicity, despite being trumpeted unofficially as "Natalie Wood's last movie". [[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 59% of 17 critics have given the film a positive review with an [[average rating]] of 5.7/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Brainstorm'' (1983) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1003017-brainstorm |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (website)|Fandango]] |accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Maslin]] of the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' gave particular credit to Louise Fletcher's "superb performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Maslin |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Maslin |title=Screen: 'Brainstorm,' Discovery Goes Away |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/30/movies/screen-brainstorm-discovery-goes-away.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 30, 1983 |accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was not a commercial success, with a production budget of $18 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Variety Staff |title=''Brainstorm'' |url=https://variety.com/1982/film/reviews/brainstorm-1200425581/ |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=December 31, 1982 |accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grossing only $10 million in ticket sales in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Brainstorm'' |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=brainstorm.htm |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher=[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] |accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the immensely troubled production and disagreements with MGM, Trumbull opted never to direct a Hollywood film again. In 1983 he stated "I have no interest...in doing another Hollywood feature film...Absolutely none. The movie business is so totally screwed up that I just don't have the energy to invest three or four years in a feature film. Moviemaking is like waging war. It destroys your personal life, too. The people who can survive the process of making films have largely given up their personal lives in order to do that, just because it's such a battle to make a movie. And in doing that, they've isolated themselves from the very audience that they're trying to reach."&lt;ref name="TCM" /&gt; In 2013, he explained that the uncertain circumstances of Natalie Wood's death were the main reason for this decision. He has since returned to [[filmmaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Douglas Trumbull, Natalie Wood's Last Director, Returns With Sci-Fi Project|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/douglas-trumbull-natalie-woods-last-569988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7102">In [[telecommunication]], a '''commercial code''' is a [[code]] once used to save on [[cablegram]] costs.{{sfn|Kahn|1967|p=838}} [[Telegraph]] (and [[telex]]) charged per word sent, so companies which sent large volumes of telegrams developed codes to save money on tolls. Elaborate commercial codes which encoded complete phrases into single words were developed and published as [[codebooks]] of thousands of phrases and sentences with corresponding codewords. Commercial codes were not generally intended to keep telegrams private, as codes were widely published; they were usually cost-saving measures only.

Many general-purpose codes, such as the [[Acme Commodity and Phrase Code|''Acme Code'']] and the ''ABC Code'', were published and widely used between the 1870s and the 1950s, before the arrival of transatlantic telephone calls and next-day airmail rendered them obsolete.{{sfn|Kahn|1967|pp=845-850}} Numerous special-purpose codes were also developed and sold for fields as varied as aviation, car dealerships, insurance, and cinema, containing words and phrases commonly used in those professions.{{sfn|Many|1967|p=844}}

These codes turned complete phrases into single words (commonly of five letters). These were not always genuine words; for example, codes contained "words" such as ''BYOXO'' ("Are you trying to weasel out of our deal?"), ''LIOUY'' ("Why do you not answer my question?"), ''BMULD'' ("You're a skunk!"), or ''AYYLU'' ("Not clearly coded, repeat more clearly.").
[[File:Ideal Fitter p269.jpg|thumb|First of 20 pages of commercial telegraph code from a 1910 radiator catalog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/idealfitterradia00amerrich|title=The Ideal fitter : American radiators &amp; Ideal boilers|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== History ==

The first telegraphic codes were developed shortly after the advent of the telegraph, and spread rapidly: in 1854, one eighth of telegrams transmitted between New York and New Orleans were written in code.{{sfn|Kahn|1967|p=838}} Cable tolls were charged by the word, and telegraph companies counted codewords like any other words, so a carefully constructed code could reduce message lengths enormously.

Early codes were typically compilations of phrases and corresponding codewords numbering in the tens of thousands. Codewords were chosen to be pronounceable words to minimize errors by telegraphers, and telegrams composed of non-pronounceable words cost significantly more.{{sfn|Kahn|1967|pp=842-843}} Regulations of the [[International Telegraph Union]] evolved over time; in 1879, it mandated coded telegrams only contain words from German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, or Latin, but commercial codes already frequently used nonsense words. By 1903 regulations were changed to allow any pronounceable word no more than ten letters long.{{sfn|Kahn|1967|pp=842-843}}

Another aim of the telegraph codes was to reduce the risk of misunderstanding by avoiding having similar words mean similar things. Codes were usually designed to avoid error by using words which could not be easily confused by telegraph operators. Telegrapher errors could sometimes cause serious monetary damages, which in one instance resulted in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case [[s:Primrose v. Western Union Telephone Company|Primrose v. Western Union Telephone Company]], in which a wool dealer argued that an error by a [[Western Union]] telegrapher cost $20,000 due to misread instructions. The Supreme Court subsequently ruled [[Western Union]] was liable only for the cost of the message, $1.15.{{sfn|Kahn|1967|p=840}}

Examples of commercial codes include the ''ABC Telegraphic Code'', ''Bentley's Second Phrase Code'', ''Lieber's Standard Telegraphic Code'' (1896), ''Slater's Telegraphy Code'' (1916), ''Western Union Universal Codebook'' (1907) and ''Unicode'' (1889).

== Mechanics ==
In codes such as the ''ABC Code'', code words could contain blanks. For example, in the "Freight and tonnage requirements" section, ''ANTITACTE'' means "Mozambique, loading at not more than two places, to ____, steamer for about ____ tons general cargo at ____ per ton on the d/w capacity to cargo". The telegrapher would then fill in the three parameters: the destination, the number of tons, and the price per ton.

The regulations of the International Telegraph Convention distinguished between "code telegrams", which it describes as "those composed of words the context of which has no intelligible meaning", and "cipher telegrams", which it describes as "those containing series of groups of figures or letters having a secret meaning or words not to be found in a standard dictionary of the language". Cipher telegrams were subject to higher tolls.

Codes such as the ''ABC Telegraphic Code'', therefore, included both numbers and code words so the user could choose between the two.

== Examples ==

Example code words:

* From the ''ABC Telegraphic Code'' (5th edition):
** ''PAROMELLA''&amp;nbsp;— in leaving the dock (harbour) struck the pier, damaging the stern
** ''ARIMASPEN''&amp;nbsp;— Phaeton with 6 B.H.P. two cylinder motor to seat four passengers speed&amp;nbsp;— miles per hour
** ''HAUBARER''&amp;nbsp;— Charterers will allow the option of carrying horses for ship's benefit
* From the ''ABC Telegraphic Code'' (6th edition):
** ''ENBET''&amp;nbsp;— Captain is insane
* From ''Bentley's Complete Phrase Code'':
** ''OYFIN''&amp;nbsp;— has not been reinsured
** ''AZKHE''&amp;nbsp;— clean bill of health
** ''ATGAM''&amp;nbsp;— have they authorised?
* From the telegraphic cipher code specially adapted to the cotton trade:
** ''DRESS''&amp;nbsp;— the supply from India will be less than expected
** ''INSANE''&amp;nbsp;— at what price, free on board and freight, can you offer us cotton for shipment by steamer sailing this week?
** ''PUNCHER''&amp;nbsp;— we anticipate rate of interest will be reduced by Bank of England
* From ''Unicode''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The '''Committee on Sustainability Assessment''' (COSA) is a global consortium of development institutions that work collaboratively to advance the systematic and science-based measurement of sustainability in agriculture. COSA applies a pragmatic and collective approach for using scientific methods to develop indicators and tools to measure sustainability through performance [[Monitoring and Evaluation|monitoring, evaluation]], and [[impact assessment]]. These sustainability measurements assess the distinct social, environmental and economic impacts of agricultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmitz|first1=Carsten|title=Voluntary Standard Systems: A Contribution to Sustainable Development|date=2014|page=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalal-Clayton|first1=Barry|last2=Sadler|first2=Barry|title=Sustainability Appraisal: A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience|date=2012|page=644}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
COSA’s approach and indicators have a basis in international treaties and normative references such as the [[International Labour Organization]] eight fundamental Conventions, the [[World Health Organization]] Guidelines for Water Quality and the [[International Finance Corporation]]. The indicators align with internationally recognized accords including the [[United Nations Global Compact]], [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]], [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]], and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and are benchmarked for consistency and shared use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isealalliance.org/online-community/resources/iseal-cosa-and-sustainable-food-lab-partnering-to-improve-smallholder-supply-chains |title=ISEAL, COSA and Sustainable Food Lab partnering to improve smallholder supply chains}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The concept for COSA was originally developed in 2005 as a project of the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]], the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] and the United Nations [[International Trade Centre]] and was focused on the coffee sector.&lt;ref name=cof1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iisd.org/pdf/2007/cosa.pdf |title=Information Brief on The COSA Project: A Multi-Criteria Cost-Benefit Analysis of Sustainable Practices in Coffee}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The COSA indicator development process was inaugurated through the International Coffee Organization whose Council unanimously endorsed it, making it the first sustainability assessment system to be formally adopted by a global commodity body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ico.org/documents/wpcouncil143e.pdf |title=International Coffee Council, Ninety-sixth Session, 25-29 September 2006, ICO Documents on Sustainability}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scanprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/COSA-Executive-Board.pdf |title=Decisions and Resolutions adopted at the Ninety-first Session of the International Coffee Council, 22-25 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development COSA project focused on developing a thorough and rigorous cost benefit analysis of sustainability practices in the coffee sector via two primary outputs: a tool for assessing costs and benefits according to COSA-defined criteria and indicators, and training to enable stakeholders to “measure and understand the costs and benefits of undertaking sustainable practices and adopting different sustainability initiatives.”&lt;ref name=cof1/&gt;

In 2008, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development COSA project published "Seeking Sustainability: COSA Preliminary Analysis of Sustainability Initiatives in the Coffee Sector".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisd.org/pdf/2008/seeking_sustainability.pdf |title=Seeking Sustainability: COSA Preliminary Analysis of Sustainability Initiatives in the Coffee Sector}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report summarized the findings of the pilot application of the COSA tool to collect and analyze data to facilitate understanding of environmental, social, and economic outcomes associated with sustainability initiatives in the coffee sector. The six coffee sector sustainability initiatives included were: [[Organic coffee|organic]], [[Fair trade coffee|Fair Trade]], [[Sustainability standards and certification|Common Code for the Coffee Community]] (4C), [[UTZ Certified|UTZ certified]], [[Rainforest Alliance]], and [[Starbucks|Starbucks C.A.F.E. Practices]]. Three coffee growing regions were included: Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

In 2012, led by its founder and President Daniele Giovannucci, the structure and constitution of COSA was formalized as an independent non-profit organization incorporated under United States law to advance research and training in the field of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nonprofits.findthecompany.com/l/1989145/Committee-On-Sustainability-Assessment |title=COSA listing on FindtheCompany.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is as this globally-focused, independent non-profit that COSA continues its work today. Core support has come primarily from the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, the Ford Foundation and the Inter-American Development Bank. COSA is supported half by public grants and half by its advisory services and impact assessment projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thecosa.org/our-partners/funders/ |title=COSA listing of organizations providing financial support}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Working in partnerships ==
COSA supports institutions to adopt and integrate approaches to sustainability, and includes more than 40 public and private sector organizations.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://thecosa.org/our-partners/partners/ |title=COSA listing of partner organizations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecosa.org/working-with-us/clients-and-partners/traders/ |title=COSA listing of Traders, Brands and Investors}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecosa.org/working-with-us/clients-and-partners |title=COSA listing of Clients and Partners }}&lt;/ref&gt;   COSA partners with research and development institutions to adopt, integrate, and build local sustainability measurement and evaluation capacity in the countries where it works, as well as for bilateral learning. Local partnerships to conduct research have included the Institute of Statistical, Social, and Economic Research at the University of Ghana, the Centro de Estudios Regionales Cafeteros y Empresariales in Colombia, the strategic think tank of the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Instituto de Estudios Peruanos, the Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute, and the CGIAR Consortium of research organizations.

The COSA partnership with the [[International Institute of Tropical Agriculture|International Institute for Tropical Agriculture]], in Kenya and Uganda, led to new processes with the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) for conducting field research to advance the understanding of the challenges faced by smallholder farmers and the roles of their cooperatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isealalliance.org/sites/default/files/private/ISEAL%20DIPI%20Kenya%20baseline%20study%20report.pdf |title=Impacts of Certification on Organized Small Coffee Farmers in Kenya: Baseline Results. April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work, commissioned by the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling Alliance with support of the Ford Foundation, evolved methods for effectively assessing the impacts of multiple sustainability certifications on the lives of farmers, their organizations, and communities.

COSA works in development projects with sustainability labels such as Fair trade, Organic, UTZ Certified, 4C, and Rainforest Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairtradeusa.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/filemanager/standards/FTUSA_Impact_Management_System.pdf |title= Fair Trade USA, Impact Management System, November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.utzcertified.org/en/aboututzcertified/monitoring-evaluation |title=UTZ Certification, Measuring Impact}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.utz.org/what-we-offer/measuring-impact/commissionedstudies/ |title=UTZ Certification, Commissioned Studies, "Impact Evaluation of UTZ Certified Coffee Program in Columbia"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isealalliance.org/online-community/blogs/iseal-commissions-three-impact-evaluations-in-kenya-india-and-Indonesia |title=ISEAL Alliance Commissions Three Impact Evaluations in Kenya, India, and Indonesia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/publications/evaluating-rainforest-alliance-certification-on-cocoa-farms-in-cote-divoire |title=Rainforest Alliance Certification on Cocoa Farm in Côte d'Ivoire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private supply chains have utilized COSA to assess and measure the impact of their sustainability efforts, fostered by development agencies such as the International Finance Corporation, USAID, or the Swiss Government, and include firms such as Nespresso,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nestle-nespresso.com/sustainability/reporting-performance |title=Reporting Performance: Reaching our 2013 sustainability commitments, Nespresso}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/sites/default/files/uploads/4/crece-program-report-exec-summ.pdf |title=CRECE's Monitoring &amp; Evaluation Study on the Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality Program in Colombia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindt and Sprungli, Mars Drinks, Cargill, ECOM Trading and Mondelez International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.mondelezinternational.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=882680 |title=Mondelez International Pledges Unprecedented Transparency by Inviting Third-Party to Report Impact of its Coffee Made Happy Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accomplishments ==
COSA indicators and tools have been widely incorporated, adopted, and adapted by institutions, corporations, and other organizations:
* The Textile Exchange adapted COSA indicators to create the Organic Cotton Sustainability Assessment Tool to assess the sustainability impact of organic cotton farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://farmhub.textileexchange.org/oc-sat |title=Organic Cotton Sustainability Assessment Tool (OC-SAT) website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://farmhub.textileexchange.org/upload/Sustainability%20Assessment%20Tool/OC_SUSTAINABILITY_ASSESSMENT_R1-2.pdf |title=Organic Cotton Sustainability Assessment Tool (OC-SAT) summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 
* COSA led the efforts to establish global metrics for small farmer sustainability for the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], which commissioned COSA, along with the Grameen Foundation and Soil &amp; More International, to develop the metrics for its Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture systems Tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/nr/sustainability/sustainability-assessments-safa/safa-app/en/ |title=FAO Sustainability Pathways, SAFA Smallholders App 2.0.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grameenfoundation.org/collaboration-fao |title=Grameen Foundation, "Collaboration with FAO"}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
*  
* The International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling Impacts Code is aligned with COSA indicators &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isealalliance.org/our-work/defining-credibility/codes-of-good-practice/impacts-code |title=ISEAL Alliance Impacts Code}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the Shared Framework for Performance Measurement of the Sustainable Food Lab and the Shared Approach to Performance Measurement: Common Indicators and Metrics” that was developed in partnership with Ford Foundation, IDH The Sustainable Trade Initiative, Seas of Change, MARS Chocolate, Root Capital, International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling Alliance, Nestle, Rainforest Alliance, and Centre for Development Innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablefoodlab.org/performance-measurement/tools-resources/indicator-framework/ |title=Sustainable Food Lab (SFL) Shared Framework for Performance Measurement}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablefoodlab.org/performance-measurement/tools-resources/deep-dive/ |title=A Shared Approach to Performance Measurement: Common Indicators and Methods}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*  
* The International Cotton Advisory Committee’s Expert Panel on the Social, Environmental, and Economic Performance of Cotton and the Food and Agriculture Organization Plant Production and Protection Division published a guidance framework for measuring the sustainability of cotton farming systems with indicators that were in part informed by COSA’s decade of work in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icac.org/getattachment/cmte-cotton-industry/Social,-Environmental-Economic-Performance-SEEP/Documents/SEEP-FINAL-REPORT-ENGLISH.pdf |title=Measuring Sustainability in Cotton Farming Systems: Towards a Guidance Framework}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
*  
* For the [[Ford Foundation]], COSA designed simple assessment tools and guidelines for Ford Foundation grantees to utilize to improve the design and management of their food crop projects.  
*  
* With the [[Multilateral Investment Fund]] (MIF) [[Inter-American Development Bank]] Sustainable Agriculture, Food, and Environment platform, COSA helps funded projects to establish or improve their measurement and evaluation systems to achieve greater levels of scalability and share lessons and knowledge across the funding Platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fomin.org/en-us/Home/News/PressReleases/ArtMID/3819/ArticleID/3127/New-SAFE-platform-seeks-to-improve-links-between-150000-smallholder-farmers-in-Latin-America-and-the-Caribbean-and-global-value-chains.aspx |title=New SAFE platform seeks to improve links between 150,000 smallholder famers in Latin American and the Caribbean and global value chains}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
*  
* COSA also collaborates with multi-stakeholder industry initiatives such as the Sustainable Coffee Challenge led by [[Conservation International]] and the Global Coffee Platform led by the 4C Coffee Association. 
Since its creation, COSA’s reach has expanded to seventeen countries: Colombia, Costa Rica, Côte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Nicaragua, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Tanzania, Uganda, and Vietnam. In addition to coffee, COSA now also works with cocoa, cotton, sugar, and food crops.

== Recognition ==
COSA has been recognized in the international development and sustainability communities for its "visible and impartial" assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coffeelands.crs.org/2012/02/coffee-impact-and-big-data/ |title=Catholic Relief Services (CRS) Coffeelands: Coffee, Impact, and "Big Data"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coffeelands.crs.org/2011/05/throwing-haymakers-at-fair-trade/ |title=Catholic Relief Services (CRS) Coffeelands: Throwing Haymakers at Fair Trade}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 2014 publication of the COSA Measuring Sustainability Report: Coffee and Cocoa in 12 Countries, the International Society of Environmental Accreditation and Labeling Alliance called COSA a leader in the "alignment of standards and certification initiatives, showing the potential of harmonizing metrics." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecosa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/The-COSA-Measuring-Sustainability-Report.pdf |title=The COSA Measuring Sustainability Report: Coffee and Cocoa in 12 Countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isealalliance.org/online-community/news/measuring-sustainability-two-major-studies-on-the-impact-of-standards-now-out |title=ISEAL Alliance.

'''Cutler's resin''' is a synthetic [[resin]] made of [[pine]] [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]], [[beeswax]], and [[sawdust]] or [[carnauba wax]] used for [[centuries]] (to today) to attach [[knife]] handles. It is used as both an [[adhesive]] and for [[waterproofing]]. The word cutler means "one who makes knives", hence the word "cutlery".

'''Daedeok Innopolis''', formerly known as '''Daedeok Science Town''', is the research and development district in the [[Yuseong-gu]] district in [[Daejeon]], [[South Korea]]. Daedeok Innopolis grew out of the research cluster established by President [[Park Chunghee]] in 1973 with the opening of the [[KAIST]]. Over 20 major research institutes and over 40 corporate research centers make up this science cluster. Over the last few years, a number of IT venture companies have sprung up in this region, which has a high concentration of Ph.Ds in the applied sciences. There are 232 research and educational institutions to be found in Daejeon, many in the Daedeok region, among them the [[Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute]] and the [[Korea Aerospace Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.metro.daejeon.kr/english/investdaejeon/daedeokvalley/daedeoksciencetown.jsp  |title=Daedeok Science Town  |accessdate=2007-02-21  |publisher=Daejeon Metropolitan City  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118140735/http://www.metro.daejeon.kr/english/investdaejeon/daedeokvalley/daedeoksciencetown.jsp  |archivedate=2006-11-18  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "town" will provide a core for the [[International Science and Business Belt]].

The Daedeok Innopolis logo was created by the industrial design company INNO Design in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], USA.

[[Image:Fabaxo1.jpg|thumb|300px|Fab Tree Hab, a "Local Biota Living Graft Structure"&lt;ref name="TerreformOne" /&gt;]]

The '''Fab Tree Hab''' is a hypothetical ecological home design developed at [[MIT]] by [[Mitchell Joachim]], Javier Arbona and Lara Greden. With the idea of easing the burden Humanity places on the environment with conventional housing by growing "living, breathing" [[tree house|tree homes]].&lt;ref name=CanadaFab&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|title=Grow your own home: 'Fab tree hab'|publisher=|accessdate=2015-11-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115053717/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|archivedate=2016-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would be built by allowing native trees to grow over a computer-designed ([[CNC]]) removable [[plywood]] [[scaffold]]. Once the plants are interconnected and stable,&lt;ref name="TerreformOne"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Mitchell Joachim |title=Terreform One |url=http://www.archinode.com/bienal.html |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the plywood would be removed and reused. MIT is experimenting with [[trees]] that grow quickly and develop an interwoven root structure that's soft enough to "train" over the scaffold, but then hardens into a more durable structure. The inside walls would be conventional [[clay]] and [[plaster]].

An old methodology new to buildings is introduced in this design - [[pleaching]]. Pleaching is a method of weaving together tree branches to form living [[arch]]ways, [[latticework|lattice]]s, or screens.&lt;ref name=Technologyreview&gt;{{Cite web|author = Tracy Staedter |title=Architects design a living home|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17102|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the technique is also named "[[Tree shaping#Aeroponic culture|Aeroponic culture]]". The load-bearing part of the structure uses trees that self-graft or inosculate such as [[Live oak|Live Oak]], [[Elm]] and [[Dogwood]]. The lattice frame for the walls and roof are created with the branches of the trees. Vines create a dense protective layer woven along the exterior, interspersed with soil pockets and growing plants.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

The Fab Tree Hab is an experiment that would develop over time.  Extra operating costs required over the life-time of the home include pest management with organic pesticides and maintenance of the [[living machine]]'s water treatment system.  Technical demonstration and innovation is still needed for certain components, primarily the bioplastic windows that accept growth of the structure and the management of flows across the wall section to assure that the interior remains dry and animal-free.  All in all, the elapsed time to reach livability is greater than the traditional sense, but so should be the health and longevity of the home and family.  Above all, building this home could be achieved at a minimal price. Depending on the surrounding climate the house is to be grown in, the team expect it will take a minimum of five years to complete its structure.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt; Realization of these homes will begin as an experiment, and it is envisioned that thereafter, the concept of renewal will take on a new architectural form - one of inter-dependency between nature and people.

As of May 2007 Mitchell Joachim stated that there is a "50 per cent" organic project in California, combining natural elements and traditional construction.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;

==Trees==
Main trees suggested to be used are [[elm]]s and [[oak]]s. The teams hopes the homes can be grown using mainly native trees.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23883">'''Games and learning''' is a field of education research that studies what is learned by playing [[video game]]s, and how the design principles, data and communities of video [[game play]] can be used to develop new [[learning environment]]s. Video games create new social and cultural worlds – worlds that help people learn by integrating thinking, [[social interaction]], and technology, all in service of doing things they care about.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Shaffer, D., Squire, K., Halverson, R., &amp; Gee, J. P. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  Computers and other technologies have already changed the way students learn. Integrating games into education has the potential to create new and more powerful ways to learn in schools, communities and workplaces.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Games and learning researchers study how the social and collaborative aspects of video game play can create new kinds of learning communities. Researchers also study how the data generated by game play can be used to design the next generation of [[Assessment for learning|learning assessment]]s.

==Research==

The games and learning research world studies how new [[digital media]] tools shift the topic of education research from recalling and repeating information to being able to find it, evaluate it and use it compellingly at the right time and in the right context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intstituteofplay.org Institute of Play]&lt;/ref&gt; Games and learning research explores how games and game communities can lead to 21st-century educational skills such as higher order thinking, the ability to solve complex problems, think independently, collaborate, communicate and apply digital tools to effectively gather information.

Research conducted by Shaffer, D., Squire, K., Halverson, R., &amp; Gee, J. P. from the University of Wisconsin – Madison shows the educational and social benefits of digital games.  Games do not need to be specifically geared towards education to be educational tools.  Games can bring together ways of knowing, ways of doing, ways of being, and ways of caring.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  As [[John Dewey]] argued, schools are built on an obsession with facts.  Students need to learn by doing, and with gaming, students can learn by doing something as a part of a larger community of people who share common goals and ways of achieving those common goals,&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; making gaming a benefit for social reasons as well.  Gaming has also changed the look of content-driven curriculum in schools.  In content-driven media, people learn by being told and reflecting on what they are told.  In gaming, game designers create [[digital environment]]s and game levels that shape, facilitate and even teach problem solving.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Gee, James Paul (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another experiment investigated the effects of utilizing the [[iPad]] as a learning tool in American Preschools. The results from the experiment contrasted greatly to the common notion that the increasing use of technology by children proves harmful. In their results, the use of the iPads, specifically the completion of the [[Mobile app|application's]] tasks within it, yielded positive results. Peer interaction, participation, and learning were all evident since the task was administered in a classroom setting that required the children to work together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lee, L.|title=Digital media for supporting young children's learning: A Case Study of American Preschool Children and Their Uses of iPads|journal=International Journal of Information and Education Technology|volume=5|issue=7|url=http://www.ijiet.org/papers/643-T061.pdf|date= December 2015|doi=10.7763/IJIET.2015.V5.643|pages=947–950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Games also teach students that failure is inevitable, but not irrevocable. In school, failure is a big deal.  In games, players can just start over from the last save.  A low cost failure ensures that players will take risks, explore and try new things.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Much of the debate about digital games for education was based on whether or not games are good for education. But that question is overly simplistic. The National Research Council's report on laboratory activities and simulations&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; makes clear that the design and not merely the medium of a physical or virtual learning activity determines its efficacy. Digital games are a medium with certain affordances and constraints, just as physical labs and virtual simulations are media with certain affordances and constraints.  Simulations and digital games actually share many similarities in this regard. Although there are multiple definitions for games,&lt;ref&gt;Salen, K., &amp; Zimmerman, E. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; the key characteristics differentiating games from simulations involve the explicit inclusion of (a) rules for engaging with the simulation, (b) goals for players to pursue, and (c) means for indicating players' progress toward those goals.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Nelson, Sengupta, &amp; D'Angelo, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klopfer, Osterweil, &amp; Salen, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koster, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGonigal, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Properly designed, features of games can provide powerful affordances for motivation and learning.  Individual studies have shown, for example, that well designed games can promote conceptual understanding and process skills,&lt;ref&gt;Annetta, Minogue, Holmes, &amp; Cheng, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark et al., 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, Ingram-Goble, &amp; Jameson, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ketelhut, Dede, Clarke, &amp; Nelson, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klopfer, Scheintaub, Huang, Wendal, &amp; Roque, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moreno &amp; Mayer, 2000, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barr, Matthew|title=Video games can develop graduate skills in higher education students|journal=Computers &amp; Education|volume=113|year=2017|pages=86–97|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131517301215|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2017.05.016}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; can foster a deeper epistemological understanding of the nature and processes through which science knowledge is developed&lt;ref&gt;Barab et al., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neulight, Kafai, Kao, Foley, &amp; Galas, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and can produce gains in players' willingness and ability to engage in scientific practices and discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Barab et al., 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galas, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McQuiggan, Rowe, &amp; Lester, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, D, Tanner-Smith, E., Killingsworth, S., &amp; Bellamy, S. (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy'', [[James Paul Gee]] talks about the application and principles of digital learning.  Gee has focused on the learning principles in video games and how these learning principles can be applied to the K-12 classroom. Successful video games are good at challenging players. They motivate players to persevere and teach players how to play.  Gee's video game learning theory includes his identification of thirty-six learning principles, including: 1) Active Control, 2) Design Principle, 3) Semiotic Principle, 4) Semiotic Domain, 5) Meta-level Thinking, 6) Psychosocial Moratorium Principle, 7) Committed Learning Principle 8) Identity Principle, 9) Self-knowledge Principle, 10) Amplification of Input Principle, 11) Achievement Principle, 12) Practice Principle, 13) Ongoing Learning Principle, and 14) Regime of Competence Principle and more.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Gee, J. P. (2003). ''What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|978-1-4039-6538-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within these learning principles Gee shows the reader the various ways in which games and learning are linked and how each principle supports learning through gaming.  One example would be Learning Principle 6: "Psychosocial Moratorium" Principle, where Gee explains that in games, learners can take risks in a space where real-world consequences are lowered.  Another of Gee's principles, #8, that shows the importance of games and learning states that learning involves taking on and playing with identities in such a way that the learner has real choices (in developing the virtual identity) and ample opportunity to mediate on the relationship between new identities and old ones.  There is tripartite play of identities as learners relate, and reflect on, their multiple real-world identities, a virtual identity, and a projective identity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Scot Osterweil, a research director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Comparative Media Studies program states that these standards and testing methods are not conducive to teaching methods that incorporate video games.&lt;ref name=Malykhina/&gt; Games alone will not make schools more efficient, cannot replace teachers or serve as an educational resource that can reach an infinite number of students.  The extent of the roles games will play in learning remains to be seen.  More research in this area is needed to determine impact of games and learning.

[[Peter Gray (psychologist)|Peter Gray]], who has conducted research on early childhood learning, states that gaming is purely a beneficial activity in young children. He states that children are able to choose how to most effectively use their time and that extensive use of a particular medium of learning shows they are taking something valuable from it. He goes on to state the significance of the computer in the modern age and that not utilizing it as a learning tool is simply foolish. Video gaming has shown positive levels of improvement in areas of cognitive function. In their study "Improving Multi-Tasking Ability through Action Videogames". Chiappe and colleagues determined that 50 hours of gaming significantly improved results on a performance test modeled after skills used when piloting an aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Chiappe, Dan, Mark Conger, Janet Liao, J. Lynn Caldwell, and Kim-Phoung L. Vu&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from this, areas of attention and vigilance, as well as basic visual processes have shown to improve with allotted video game time.

==Application==

Digital learning tools have the potential of being customized to fit the abilities of individual students and can engage them with interactive tasks and simulate real-life situations.&lt;ref name=Malykhina&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-video-games-are-the-future-of-education/|author=Malykhina, E.|year=2014|title=Fact or Fiction?: Video Games Are the Future of Education|work=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Games can create new social and cultural worlds that may not have been available to everyone in the past.  These worlds can help people learn by integrating thinking, social interaction, and technology, all in service of doing things they care about.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Video games are important because they let people participate in and experience new worlds.  They let players think, talk, and act in new ways.  Indeed, players inhabit roles that are otherwise inaccessible to them.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  One example of a game where players are learning while playing would be ''[[The Sims (video game)|The Sims]]'', a real-time strategy game where players need to make decisions that alter their character's life.  They can manipulate the scenario to create digital lives where they can experience the struggles of single parenthood or poverty.  Players in this game are not allowed to modify a previous decision to alter the outcome, even if the outcome is unpleasant.  The goal is to survive to the best of their abilities.  The game is complicated and difficult, just as it would be to live a real life. Regarding a more traditional approach to education, ''The Sims'' has been used as a platform for students to learn a language and explore [[world history]] while developing skills such as reading, math, logic and collaboration.&lt;ref name=Malykhina/&gt;

While not all researchers agree, some recent studies have shown the possitive effects of using games for learning. A study carried out by professor Traci Sitzmann at the University Oregon among 6,476 students states that "trainees in the game group had 11 percent higher factual knowledge levels, 14 percent higher skill-based knowledge levels, and 9 percent higher retention levels than trainees in the comparison group".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sitzmann|first=Traci|date=Summer 2011|title=A meta-analytic examination of the instructional effectiveness of computer-based simulation games|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-6570.2011.01190.x/abstract|journal=Personnel Psychology|volume= 64. Issue 2|pages=489–528|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.2011.01190.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other aggregated studies also show an increase in learning performance thanks to the use of videogames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wouters, van Nimwegen, van Oostendorp, van der Spek|first=Pieter, Christof, Herre, Erik D.|date=February 4, 2013|title=A Meta-Analysis of the Cognitive and Motivational Effects of Serious Games|url=http://ocw.metu.edu.tr/pluginfile.php/11786/mod_resource/content/1/A%20Meta-Analysis%20of%20the%20Cognitive%20and%20Motivational%20Effects%20of%20Serious%20Games.pdf|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=|pages=|via=|doi=10.1037/a0031311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
{{See also|Video game controversies|Research on the effects of violence in mass media}}
Critics suggest that lessons people learn from playing video games are not always desirable.  Douglas Gentile, an associate professor of psychology at [[Iowa State University]] found that children who repeatedly play violent video games are learning thought patterns that will stick with them and influence behaviors as they grow older.  Researchers from this study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Iowa State University | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140324181255.htm | title=Life lessons: Children learn aggressive ways of thinking and behaving from violent video games, study finds | work=ScienceDaily | date=March 24, 2014 | accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that over time children started to think more aggressively, and when provoked at home, school or in other situations, children reacted much like they did when playing a violent video game.&lt;ref&gt;Iowa State University Study, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  But even the harshest critics agree that people can learn something from playing video games.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  While research on the behavioral and cognitive impacts of video games with violence have shown mixed outcomes, games with little or no violence have shown promising results. [[Elizabeth Zelinski]], a professor of gerontology and psychology at the University of Southern California states that some digital games have been shown to improve the function of the brain, while others have the potential to reverse cognitive loss associated with aging.&lt;ref&gt;Bergland, C. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Some games require players to make decisions ranging from simple to quite complex to drive its progress.

Some researchers question whether a greater reliance on video games is in students' best interests, indicating there is little proof that skillful game play translates into better test scores or broader cognitive development.  Emma Blakey notes very few studies have examined whether video games improve classroom performance and academic achievement.&lt;ref name=Malykhina/&gt;

Others, like Emma Blakey, a PhD researcher in developmental psychology at the University of Sheffield in England, question whether a greater reliance on video games is in students' best interests, indicating there is little proof that skillful game play translates into better test scores or broader cognitive development.&lt;ref name=Malykhina/&gt; Because schools are working to meet [[Common Core State Standards]], which dictate what students should be able to accomplish in English and mathematics at the end of each grade (using [[standardized testing]] as a way of tracking a student's progress), game use for learning becomes obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sri.com/sites/default/files/brochures/digital-games-for-learning-exec-summ_0.pdf | title=Digital Games for Learning: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis | publisher=SRI International | date=August 2013 | accessdate=August 20, 2016 | author=Clark, D.|author2=Tanner-Smith, E.|author3=Killingsworth, S .|author4=Bellamy, S. | location=Menlo Park, CA | type=Executive Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6902">'''The Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) is a follow on activity form the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE) high-resolution sea surface temperature pilot project'''   (GHRSST-PP) provides a new generation of global high-resolution (&lt;10&amp;nbsp;km) SST  data products to the operational oceanographic, meteorological, climate and general scientific community, in real time and delayed mode.  

See [http://www.ghrsst.org GHRSST] for full details.

[[Sea surface temperature]] (SST) measured from Earth Observation [[Satellites]] in considerable spatial detail and at high frequency, is increasingly required for use in the context of operational monitoring and forecasting of the [[ocean]], for assimilation into coupled [[ocean-atmosphere model]] systems and for applications  in short-term [[numerical weather prediction]] and longer term [[climate change]] detection. Currently there are many different SST data sets available derived from satellite systems. But, scientists and operational agencies alike are presented with a bewidering set of options in terms of SST product content, coverage, spatial resolution, timeliness, format and accuracy. The international GODAE steering committee realised that SST data products were not adequate for GODAE forecast systems and initiated the GODAE High Resolution SST Pilot Project (GHRSST-PP). User Requirements were collected together to define the optimal SST data products that could be developed to suit the widest possible number of applications. In 2008 the GHRSST-PP Science Team agreed to close the Pilot Project as the GODAE project was completed.  A follow on activity called the Group for High Resolution SST is now continuing the coordination of GHRSST activities.

==Purpose==
The purpose of GHRSST is to develop an operational demonstration system and to drive all scientific aspects related to SST.  The activity co-ordinates the delivery of a new generation of global coverage high-resolution (better than 10&amp;nbsp;km and ~6 hourly) SST data products. GHRSST data products are derived by combining readily available but complementary Level-2 (L2) satellite and in situ observations in real time to improve spatial coverage, temporal resolution, cross-sensor calibration stability and SST product accuracy.

GHRSST is an international activity that orchestrates a wide variety of input and output data. The data are shared, indexed, processed, quality controlled, analysed and documented within an international framework. Large volumes of data and associated data services are harnessed together to deliver the new generation of global coverage high resolution SST data sets.

GHRSST is based on a distributed system in which the data processing operations that are necessary to operationally generate and distribute high resolution SST data sets having global coverage are shared by Regional Data Assembly Centres (RDAC). RDAC ingest, quality control and merge existing satellite and in situ SST data sources that are then merged to generate regional coverage SST data products having the same netCDF format specification (called L2P products), in real-time. RDAC data products are then assembled together at Global Data Analysis Centres (GDAC) where they are merged to provide L4 global [[coverage data]] products free of gaps. The distributed processing system is referred to as the GHRSST Regional/Global Task Sharing (R/GTS) framework

The GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS) is central to the successful implementation and operation of the R/GTS. It provides a common data processing specification that must be implemented at each GHRSST RDAC and GDAC. It defines clearly the input and output data specifications, data processing procedures, algorithms and data product file formats that are used within the GDS and are thus common to each GHRSST RDAC and GDAC. Conforming to the netCDF CF1.3 specification is a prerequisite if the GHRSST Global/Regional task sharing implementation framework is to function efficiently.

There are great strengths to this approach from a community perspective. For example, a common processing description is necessary to simplify documentation of data, facilitate exchange by sharing a common data format agreed by RDAC, GDAC and users, to avoid significant duplication of effort, to minimise reformatting of different data products derived by RDAC and to ease the integration of RDAC data to provide global coverage data sets at GDAC centres. Operationally produced data products will be improved by using additional data that are only available in a delayed mode together with extensive quality control procedures as part of the GHRSST reanalysis (RAN) project (see http://ghrsst.nodc.noaa.gov).

Today GHRSST is a truly international project with over $24 Million US invested across all of the project activities. A basic 'version-1.0' of the GHRSST Regional/Global Task Sharing (R/GTS) system has been implemented in an internationally distributed manner. Global and regional coverage SST data products are now produced by RDAC in the USA, Australia, France, Japan, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Italy and Canada. Products are passed in near real time to a recently operational GDAC at NASA JPL, USA. Research and development within GHRSST projects continue to tackle the problems of diurnal variability, skin temperature deviations and SST validation. Data management teams continue to refine the GHRSST data management structures to provide a functional system that conforms to federal directives (e.g., ISO, FGDC, INSPIRE). A Long Term Data Stewardship and Reanalysis Facility (http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/SatelliteData/ghrsst/ LTSRF) is operated by the NOAA National Center for Environmental Information in collaboration with the JPL GDAC (http://ghrsst.jpl.nasa.gov). The GHRSST-PP International Project Office, jointly funded by the European Space Agency and Met Office, UK, continues to manage the international co-ordination of the project.  GHRSST operates a Multi Product Ensemble (GMPE) of operational SST and Sea Ice analyses of the world which contributes a formal action of the [http://www.earthobservations.org/ Group on Earth Observations] (GEO).

Most importantly, an international user community has emerged that is now testing and applying GHRSST data products and services within scientific projects and operational systems - all in real time. Over 20GB of data is exchanged within the international project each day! The challenge for GHRSST version-1 R/GTS and the Science Team that is responsible for its design and implementation is to deliver sustained production of stable, high-quality, SST data products and services and grow the user community. Only a user community can demonstrate a requirement for sustained operations. Once that point is reached, the GHRSST will have achieved its aim.

A spectacular collection of '''furniture and wooden artifacts''' was excavated by the University of Pennsylvania at the site of '''Gordion''' (Latin: [[Gordium]]), the capital of the ancient kingdom of [[Phrygia]] in the early first millennium BC. The best preserved of these works came from three royal burials, surviving nearly intact due to the relatively stable conditions that had prevailed inside the tomb chambers. The Gordion wooden objects are now recognized as the most important collection of wooden finds recovered from the ancient Near East.

The group comprises over 100 fine wooden artifacts, including tables, a bed, a throne, serving stands, stools, footstools, plates, spoons, boxes, a parasol, and 12 carved wooden animals. Several pieces of furniture are highly ornate, profusely inlaid with geometric patterns that exhibit sophisticated types of symmetry, and featuring designs that symbolize the Phrygian Mother Goddess Matar ([[Cybele|Kybele]]). The furniture from the largest tomb at Gordion, Tumulus MM, is associated with King [[Midas]], the powerful Phrygian ruler of the eighth century BC.

The wood has been conserved over a period of 30 years using innovative methods developed by an international team of conservators; these methods are now considered standard for the treatment of dry archaeological wood. The good state of preservation of the Gordion wooden objects has allowed scientists to identify the woods used and investigate their deterioration. Chemical analyses of the residues from the associated bronze vessels have indicated how the bronzes were used with the furniture - and have even determined the menu of a royal Phrygian funerary feast. Several of the most elaborate pieces have been mounted for display in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, Ankara, Turkey.

==Ancient wooden artifacts from Gordion==

The central [[Anatolia]]n site of [[Gordium|Gordion]] was first excavated by Gustav and Alfred Körte in 1900 and then by Professor [[Rodney Young (archaeologist)|Rodney S. Young]] of the University of Pennsylvania in a major campaign between 1950 and 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Körte and Körte, ''Gordion''. Young, ''Three Great Early Tumuli''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many exceptional [[Phrygia]]n artifacts recovered were more than one hundred wooden objects dating to the eighth century BC—a rare find, since organic materials seldom survive in buried conditions. The wood discovered by the Körte brothers consisted mainly of furniture fragments from a [[tumulus]] burial (K-III), which were significant but too fragmentary to be well understood. Young’s excavations, however, produced a spectacular collection of wooden furniture and other types of objects, many of which were in relatively good condition.[[File:TumMMWPintro.jpg|thumb|upright=2.1|View of Tumulus MM at sunset.]]These came mainly from three early royal tumuli (Tumulus MM, Tumulus P, and Tumulus W), along with carbonized remains from the destruction level of the city mound. Young died in 1974, before finishing his final report on the excavation of these tombs, but his monograph, Three Great Early Tumuli, The Gordion Excavations Final Reports, Volume 1, was published posthumously by a group of his colleagues, based on his original notes. Three Great Early Tumuli detailed the excavation of the burials and their grave goods in preliminary interpretations and working drawings. During the production of this volume, many of the early interpretations of the wooden artifacts were found to be incorrect, and a reassessment of the finds was begun by Dr. [[Elizabeth Simpson (archaeologist)|Elizabeth Simpson]], now professor of ancient art and archaeology at the [[Bard Graduate Center]], New York, NY.

In 1981, Simpson went to Turkey to photograph and draw the objects and discovered that the wood was deteriorating. A project to study and conserve the Gordion wooden artifacts was then organized under her direction with the support of the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]. Work has been carried out since that time by the Gordion Furniture Project team in the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]] (Anadolu Medeniyetleri Müzesi), Ankara, Turkey.  More than 40 archaeologists, conservators, scientists, and artists have been affiliated with the project since its inception, with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Geographic Society, the 1984 Foundation, the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, the Getty Grant Program, and other foundations and individual donors. During the past 30 years, most of the wood has been conserved, and many of the objects have been reconstructed for display in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson and Spirydowicz, ''Gordion Wooden Furniture''. Simpson, “Phrygian Furniture from Gordion.” Spirydowicz, “The Conservation of Ancient Phrygian Furniture from Gordion, Turkey.”&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is now considered to be the largest and most important group of well-preserved ancient wooden artifacts excavated from the Near East.

==Tumulus MM==
Rodney Young named the largest burial mound at the site Tumulus MM—for “Midas Mound,” after the famous Phrygian king [[Midas]], who ruled at Gordion during the second half of the eighth century B.C.[[File:TumMMcoffinWP1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|The king buried in Tumulus MM.]]Young eventually came to believe that the tomb’s occupant was not Midas but rather his father, although in either case the wooden finds from the burial can be associated with King Midas. When Midas took the throne on the death of his father, he surely would have officiated at the funeral, with the grave goods provided by him for the deposition.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, “Celebrating Midas.”&lt;/ref&gt; The historical King Midas was a contemporary of the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] (r. 721–705 BC) and was also well known to the Greeks. Midas was the first foreigner to make an offering at the sanctuary of Apollo at [[Delphi]], according to the Greek historian [[Herodotus]], who wrote that the king had dedicated his throne, which was “well worth seeing.”&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus 1.14.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, this tantalizing comment tells us little about the appearance of the throne of Midas. However, the magnificent wooden furniture from Tumulus MM at Gordion suggests that the throne was likely made from beautiful woods with carved and inlaid decoration, including a complex of geometric patterns that reflected the power of the Phrygian royal house and its connection to the Phrygian mother goddess Matar ([[Cybele|Kybele]]).&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, “Phrygian Furniture from Gordion,” 198-201.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:TumMMchamberWP2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|View of the Tumulus MM grave goods, 1957.]]Tumulus MM produced an array of priceless artifacts: 170 bronze vessels, some with deposits of organic residues; 10 bronze-and-leather belts; more than 180 bronze [[fibula (brooch)|fibulae]] (ancient safety pins); pottery vessels containing the remains of food; and 15 pieces of fine wooden furniture.&lt;ref&gt;Young, ''Three Great Early Tumuli'', 100–190. Simpson and Spirydowicz, ''Gordion Wooden Furniture'', 35–52. For a detailed discussion, see Simpson, ''The Furniture from Tumulus MM'', and appendices, listed by author under ''References'' below.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact nature of the furniture was not clear to Young and his team when they entered the chamber in 1957, as many of the objects had broken along the lines of the joinery, with their constituent parts dispersed on the tomb floor. The first thing the excavators saw was the skeleton of the king lying on a mass of textiles, covering what Young thought was a four-poster bed. To the east of the “bed” were several furniture legs scattered among remnants of cloth. Leaning against the east wall were two ornate, inlaid objects, called “screens” by Young and initially identified as “throne backs.” To the south of these, a fancy inlaid table had collapsed with its frame intact, and nearby were the tops and legs of eight “plain” tables. Most of the bronze vessels found in the tomb had once been hung on the walls or placed on the tables, but all had fallen to the floor.

===The inlaid table, Tumulus MM===
	The inlaid table, called the “Pagoda Table” by Young because of its exotic design and decoration, was made of 40 major wooden components.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, “Reconstructing an Ancient Table.”&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inlaid Table Mount TumMM Gordion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Elizabeth Simpson and Nazif Uygur constructing the Plexiglas mount for the inlaid table, 1989.]]The table had three legs, with lion-paw feet, and three structural supports that rose from the feet to prop up the frame at its corners. The four-sided frame was carved as a series of panels, connected by double bars, and inlaid with geometric patterns such as fields of squares or diamonds, configurations of hooks, rosette-like designs, and mazes. Some of these patterns appear elsewhere as markings on early figurines and clothing, and survive on women’s dowry textiles and ritual cloths in Europe and Anatolia up to the present. Evidence suggests that these designs were protective and empowering, with connotations of procreation and fertility. The inlaid table was thus decorated with apotropaic and magical imagery, suggesting that it may have had a ritual function. It was also a practical, portable banquet table, with four handles and a tray-shaped top. [[Buxus sempervirens|Boxwood]] was used for the frame and legs, [[juniper]] for the inlay, and [[walnut]] for the table top. In 1983, the table was reconstructed for display in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, where it could be seen assembled for the first time in 2700 years. The mount was refurbished and the display reinstalled in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson and Payton, “Royal Wooden Furniture from Gordion,” 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The plain tables, Tumulus MM===
The other eight tables found in the tomb were simpler versions of the inlaid table.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, “Banquet Tables at Gordion,” 136-137.&lt;/ref&gt; Each had three curved boxwood legs and a tray-shaped top. The tops of seven of the tables were made of walnut; the wood of the top of the eighth table was probably [[maple]] or [[Prunus|cherry]]. Contrary to Young’s earlier supposition, the legs were not steam bent but were made from naturally curved or trained branches. Tenons at the tops of the legs were fit into “collars” that extended down from the lower surface of the table tops. Research has shown that this system of joinery was widespread in antiquity, attested in the Middle Bronze Age tombs of [[Jericho]] and in the [[Pazyryk burials]] of the fourth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, “Furniture in Ancient Western Asia,” 1654–1655, 1662–1666, 1668–1669.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The serving stands, Tumulus MM===
	[[File:TumMMservingstandsWP6.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The Tumulus MM serving stands, 1957.]]Young's “screens” were made of boxwood, inlaid with juniper, with walnut top pieces and curved “legs” set into the front faces. At the center of each face was an inlaid rosette, supported by two curved legs with stylized lion-paw feet.

These elements were set within a grid of inlaid square designs surrounded by thousands of tiny diamonds and triangles. Most of the square designs were [[symmetry|symmetrical]] with respect to rotations of 180 degrees, which allowed several basic designs to be turned and flipped to form derivative versions, adding complexity and obscuring the underlying patterns in which the basic designs had been arranged.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, “The Phrygian Artistic Intellect,” 29-34.&lt;/ref&gt; This surprising play with symmetry indicates that the Phrygian woodworkers were clever, imaginative artisans with a pronounced mathematical orientation.

[[File:Serving Stand A TumMM Gordion.jpg|thumb|upright=.6|left|Detail of the central rosette, serving stand A.]]This impression was confirmed by an analysis of the prominent designs at the center of the screen faces, which have now been identified as religious symbols. The rosette represented the Phrygian goddess Matar and the curved legs her two attendant lions, in an abstract version of the figures in the niche of Arslan Kaya, the monumental rock-cut shrine of the Phrygian highlands.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, “Phrygian Furniture from Gordion,” 198-201.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tumulus MM screens thus took the form of portable shrines of the goddess Matar.

Each “screen” had a top piece, supported by a back leg and diagonal struts. Research has now shown that the “screens” were not “throne backs” but serving stands.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson and Spirydowicz, ''Gordion Wooden Furniture'', 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt; The top pieces featured large wooden rings that had held small bronze cauldrons, ten of which were found nearby in the tomb. Also found near the stands were two bronze ladles, which had undoubtedly been used to transfer the contents of the cauldrons into other vessels. The Tumulus MM serving stands have been assembled for display in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson and Payton, “Royal Wooden Furniture from Gordion,” 47. Simpson, ''The Furniture from Tumulus MM'', 159–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TumMMceremonyWP10.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Painting by Greg Harlin of the funeral ceremony before the Tumulus MM burial.]]

===The king’s  coffin, Tumulus MM===
	At the north of the chamber was the king’s “bed,” which has now been identified as an open [[treetrunk coffin|log coffin]], carved from a huge [[Cedrus libani|cedar]] log, with ledges extending out at both ends. Four large [[pine]] blocks had braced the coffin body, and inlaid rails were socketed into the sides. This new information led to a fuller understanding of the circumstances of the king’s burial. The remains of the coffin, as disposed on the tomb floor, showed that a funeral ceremony had taken place before the interment: the coffin had clearly been assembled elsewhere before the burial, then disassembled, and its parts placed in the chamber in something other than their original positions.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, “Midas’ Bed and a Royal Phrygian Funeral.”&lt;/ref&gt;

The contents of the tomb, which were largely banquet furnishings, must have been used for the ceremony. Analysis of the food and drink residues produced the menu of the funerary banquet. The feast included a spicy stew, made with barbecued sheep or goat, honey, wine, olive oil, and most likely lentils, seasoned with anise or fennel. The small bronze cauldrons that sat in the tops of the serving stands had contained a mixed fermented beverage of grape wine, barley beer, and honey mead.&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, Glusker, Moreau, Nuñez, Beck, Simpson, Butrym, Exner, and Stout, “A Funerary Feast Fit for King Midas.”&lt;/ref&gt; The beverage served at the king’s funeral has been reconstructed by [[Dogfish Head Brewery]] as the award-winning “Midas Touch,” which is now widely available. This collaborative research allowed the funeral ceremony before the burial to be reconstructed in a painting by Greg Harlin.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, “Celebrating Midas,” 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tumulus P==
	This rather complete picture has aided in the interpretation of the Tumulus P and Tumulus W burials. These tombs produced wonderful wooden finds, but they are largely fragmentary because the roofs of both chambers had collapsed, crushing the contents within. Tumulus P, excavated in 1956, covered the tomb of a small child, who was buried with bronze vessels, fibulae, and belts; iron implements; painted and monochrome pottery; and a glass bowl—as well as 21 or more pieces of furniture and 49 other wooden objects.&lt;ref&gt;Young, ''Three Great Early Tumuli'', 7–77. Simpson and Spirydowicz, Gordion Wooden Furniture, 52–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The serving stand, Tumulus P===
The wood finds included a “screen,” which, like its Tumulus MM counterparts, was actually a serving stand. The top piece, back leg, and face of the stand were made of boxwood. The face was carved in openwork and inlaid with juniper and [[Taxus baccata|yew]] in a profusion of geometric patterns. As with the Tumulus MM serving stands, this stand too featured a large rosette at the center supported by abstract lion legs, suggesting that it had also represented a shrine of the Phrygian goddess Matar.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, “Phrygian Furniture from Gordion,” 198-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The inlaid, studded stool, Tumulus P===
[[File:Inlaid Stool TumP Gordion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|The Tumulus P stool reconstructed for display.]]Found near the stand in the southwest corner of the tomb were pieces of a carved wooden stool, inlaid in geometric patterns and studded with bronze tacks. The stool was a colorful production, assembled from alternating strips of boxwood and yew. The boxwood strips, where inlaid, were inlaid with yew, and one yew strip was inlaid with boxwood. The two faces were joined at the top by undecorated strips, and at the bottom by two stretchers, carved on their top and outer faces. The stool was reconstructed on a [[Plexiglas]] mount (1993) and is now on display in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations. The design of this stool is unusual, and can only be understood in reference to the Tumulus MM inlaid table. The two faces of the stool were conceived with such a table in mind, representing the main features of the three-dimensional table “collapsed” into two dimensions in a clever intellectual conceit.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, “The Phrygian Artistic Intellect,” 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Not content with this amusing play with form and dimension, the cabinetmakers then negated the force of the metaphor by alternating the colored woods, producing the impression of a series of dark and light stripes.

===Other furniture and wooden artifacts from Tumulus P===
[[File:Toy Animals TumP Gordion.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|Animal combat, Tumulus P.]]Many other interesting pieces of furniture were recovered from the Tumulus P burial. The “Tripod Tray Table,” found at the north of the chamber, was named for its massive, boxwood tray-shaped top. The table had three curved legs, each with a stylized lion-paw foot and a large ring at the top. Nearby were the remains of another fancy table, called the “Mosaic Table” by Young because of its boldly inlaid table top. The top was made of boxwood boards, joined edge to edge and inlaid with strips of yew in a pattern of squares and crosses. Also found in the tomb were two plain tables, six or more stools, two footstools, a small chair or throne, and a carved and inlaid bed. Other wooden finds include a parasol, a box, eight spoons or ladles, and 23 plates and bowls. Among the most charming of the wooden objects from Tumulus P are 12 small animals, including two lions, a lion and bull in combat, a [[griffin]] eating a fish, two bulls, and a leaping ram or goat—toys for the tomb’s young royal occupant.

==Tumulus W==
[[File:TumWscreenWP16.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Tumulus W screen, 1959.]]The Tumulus W burial, excavated in 1959, contained bronze and pottery vessels, bronze fibulae, a bronze-and-leather belt, and fragments of several wooden objects.&lt;ref&gt;Young, ''Three Great Early Tumuli'', 196–218. Simpson and Spirydowicz, ''Gordion Wooden Furniture'', 68–71.&lt;/ref&gt; These included the remnants of a “screen,” which was apparently a serving stand like those from the Tumulus MM and Tumulus P burials. Its front face was carved in openwork and studded with bronze tacks. Although the “screen” is only partially preserved, it had clearly been an extraordinary piece of furniture. Five or more wooden plates from the tomb are of particular interest because of their method of manufacture. Close examination has revealed tool marks indicating that the plates were made on an ancient reciprocating [[lathe]]—the earliest evidence for the lathe from a securely dated archaeological context.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, “Early Evidence for the Use of the Lathe in Antiquity.”&lt;/ref&gt;

==The City Mound==
	The destruction level of the city mound yielded [[charcoal|carbonized]] fragments of what may be a serving stand, an inlaid table, and other elaborate pieces of furniture, fitted with bronze studs and brackets as well as finely carved [[ivory]] plaques.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson and Spirydowicz, ''Gordion Wooden Furniture'', 171–173.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scientific advances have allowed the charcoal to be identified, indicating that boxwood, maple, yew, [[oak]], and pine are present. Research into the form of the city mound objects is currently underway; consolidation of the carbonized wood has been deemed unadvisable and will not be undertaken.

==Research, conservation, and scientific analyses==
	Conservation of the wooden artifacts from Gordion has been ongoing since 1981, initiated by Robert Payton, now conservator at the [[Museum of London]].&lt;ref&gt;Payton, “The Conservation of an Eighth Century B.C. Table from Gordion.”&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1990, work has been carried out by a team of conservators, conservation scientists, preparators, and graduate student interns in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, Ankara, under the direction of Professor Krysia Spirydowicz, [[Queen’s University]], Kingston, Ontario. The preservation method developed by Payton was adapted and refined to treat over 40 pieces of furniture and more than 50 wooden objects from the three tumuli at Gordion.&lt;ref&gt;Spirydowicz, “The Conservation of Ancient Phrygian Furniture from Gordion, Turkey.” Spirydowicz, “Conservation of the Wooden Furniture from Tumulus MM.”&lt;/ref&gt; Study of the artifacts revealed that the wood was very fragile when handled.  Since the wood was very light in weight and retained little of its original cellular structure, consolidation was necessary in order to strengthen the wood, using a dilute solution of Butvar B-98, a synthetic polymer based on [[polyvinyl butyral]].  The same polymer was utilized in more concentrated form to carry out repairs; for particularly fragmentary objects, glass microspheres were added to the solution to make a paste for filling gaps and reinforcing joins.&lt;ref&gt;Spirydowicz, Simpson, Blanchette, Schniewind, Toutloff, and Murray, “Alvar and Butvar: The Use of Polyvinyl Acetal Resin for the Treatment of the Wooden Artifacts from Gordion, Turkey.”&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Serving Stand TumP Gordion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Conservators Latif Özen, Krysia Spirydowicz, and Nancy Love, with the Tumulus P stand in storage, Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, Ankara.]]A wood species analysis was begun in 1983 by Professor Burhan Aytuğ of Istanbul University, and is now under the direction of Professor Robert Blanchette, Department of Wood Pathology, [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;Aytuğ, “Le Mobilier funéraire du roi Midas I.” Aytuğ, Blanchette, and Held, “Wood Species Analysis.”&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Blanchette is also supervising a wood pathology analysis, which aims to understand the types of degradation present in the wood and the causes of the decay.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchette, “Assessment of Wood Deterioration in the Furniture and Coffin from Tumulus MM.”&lt;/ref&gt; The graffiti on the serving stands from Tumulus MM have been studied by Professor Lynn Roller, [[University of California, Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;Roller, “Graffiti on the Wooden Serving Stands from Tumulus MM.”&lt;/ref&gt; The textiles associated with the furniture from Tumulus MM are the subject of a collaborative research project carried out at the [[Museum Conservation Institute]], [[Smithsonian Institution]], headed by Mary Ballard.&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, Alden, Cunningham, Hopwood, Koles, and Dussubieux, “Preliminary Analyses of Textiles Associated with the Furniture from Tumulus MM.”&lt;/ref&gt; The menu of the funerary feast that took place before the Tumulus MM burial was determined by Dr. Patrick McGovern and his colleagues, and the mixed fermented beverage was created through the efforts of Pat McGovern and Sam Calagione of [[Dogfish Head Brewery]].&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, “Chemical Identification of the Beverage and Food Remains in Tumulus MM.” For a profile of Sam Calagione and his collaboration with McGovern, see Burkhard Bilger, “A Better Brew.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on the wooden objects from the Gordion tombs is the subject of numerous publications (see ''References'' below for a selection).  Thirty years of study have yielded extensive information about the woods, tools, and techniques used by the royal cabinetmakers, who were surely among the greatest craftsmen of their time.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, “Phrygian Furniture from Gordion,” 208-209. Simpson, “Woodworking Tools and Techniques.”&lt;/ref&gt; The Phrygian artisans, while working well within ancient traditions of wood carving and joinery, were outstanding in their virtuoso use of wood inlay, their abstraction of natural forms, and their elaborate play with symmetry and design. The many fine wooden objects excavated at Gordion may serve to indicate the magnitude of our loss of most wooden artifacts from the archaeological record, and to remind us of the importance of organic materials for an appreciation of the arts of antiquity.

The '''Gravity Research Foundation''' is an organization established in 1948 by businessman [[Roger Babson]] (founder of [[Babson College]])&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Isaac Babson" (1948, August, 23).  ''Newsweek'', '''32'''(8), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; to find ways to implement [[gravitational shielding]].&lt;ref&gt;Babson, R. W. (1950).  Chapter XXXV - Playing with Gravity, ''Actions and Reactions'' [Second Revised Edition].  New York: Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers [http://www3.babson.edu/Archives/research_publications/upload/A&amp;RCh34-35Addenda.pdf] Page over to Chapter XXXV for [[Roger W. Babson]]'s description of the Gravity Research Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Rideout, George M | title=1949--2009 Sixty years Gravity Research Foundation P.O.

(1998).  Introductory remarks on the Gravity Research Foundation on its fiftieth anniversary.  In N. Dadhich &amp; J. Marlikar (Ed.). ''Gravitation and Relativity: At the Turn of the Millennium'' [p. 375].  15th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation.  Pune, India: Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics. {{ISBN|81-900378-3-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contest, which awards prizes of up to $4,000, has been won by at least five people who later won the Nobel Prize in physics.

The foundation held conferences and conducted operations in [[New Boston, New Hampshire]] through the late 1960s, but that aspect of its operation ended following Babson's death in 1967.
 
It is mentioned on stone monuments, donated by Babson, at more than a dozen American universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/The-Antigravity-of-the/47082/ Chronicle of Higher Ed: "A Visionary's Dream of Antigravity"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Thomas Edison]] apparently suggested the creation of the Gravity Research Foundation to Babson,&lt;ref&gt;Valone, T. (Ed.) (2001, January).  ''Electrogravitics Systems: Reports on a New Propulsion Methodology'' [p. 4].  Washington, DC: Integrity Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; who established it in several scattered buildings in the small town of New Boston, New Hampshire.&lt;ref name="Mooallem"&gt;Mooallem, J. (2007, October).  A curious attraction.  ''Harper's Magazine,'' '''315'''(1889), pp. 84-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Babson said he chose that location because he thought it was far enough from big cities to survive a nuclear war. Babson wanted to put up a sign declaring New Boston to be the safest place in [[North America]] if [[World War III]] came, but town fathers toned it down to say merely that New Boston was a safe place.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LW1D1dat2VkC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=babson+new+boston+safe+world+war+III&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uUcokd7OIV&amp;sig=hYdeEHi3t2Pj9undQX5P7blCrm4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje75bEioLWAhULxoMKHb13Dm0Q6AEIUDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=babson%20new%20boston%20safe%20world%20war%20III&amp;f=false New Boston Historical Society history of New Boston, page 113]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay titled ''Gravity - Our Enemy Number One'', Babson indicated that his wish to overcome gravity dated from the childhood drowning of his sister. "She was unable to fight gravity, which came up and seized her like a dragon and brought her to the bottom," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;See Appendix Intro. 3: Gravity – Our Enemy Number One. In Harry Collins (2004). ''Gravity's Shadow: The Search for Gravitational Waves.''  Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press.  {{ISBN|978-0-226-11378-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation held occasional conferences that drew such people as [[Clarence Birdseye]] of frozen-food fame and [[Igor Sikorsky]], inventor of the helicopter.&lt;ref name="Kaiser"&gt;Kaiser, D. (2000).  Chapter 10 - Roger Babson and the Rediscovery of General Relativity. ''Making Theory: Producing Physics and Physicists in Postwar America'' [Ph.D. Dissertation].  Harvard University, pp. 567-594.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, attendees sat in chairs with their feet higher than their heads, to counterbalance gravity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newbostonnh.gov/Pages/NewBostonNH_About/MoreGrav Article on town website]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the foundation's work, however, involved sponsoring essays by researchers on gravity-related topics.&lt;ref&gt;"Trouble with Gravity, The" (1950, January, 2).  ''Time'', '''55''', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  It had only a couple of employees in New Boston.

The physical Gravity Research Foundation disappeared some time after Babson's death in 1967. Its only remnant in New Boston is a granite slab in a [[traffic island]] that celebrates the foundation's "active research for [[Anti-gravity|antigravity]] and a partial gravity insulator." The building that held the foundation's meetings has long held a restaurant, and for a time had a bar called Gravity Tavern, since renamed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unionleader.com/article/20120810/NEWS02/708109945&amp;source=RSS Union-Leader Moly Stark name returns]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The essay award lives on, offering prizes of up to $4,000. As of 2018, it is still administered out of [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]] by George Rideout, Jr., son of the foundation's original director. 

Over time, the foundation shed its [[Crank (person)|crankish]] air, turning its attention from trying to block gravity to trying to understand it. The annual essay prize has drawn respected researchers, including physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], who won in 1971, mathematician/author [[Roger Penrose]], who won in 1975, and astrophysicist and Nobel laureate [[George Smoot]], who won in 1993. Other notable award winners include [[Jacob Bekenstein]], [[Sidney Coleman]], [[Bryce DeWitt]], [[Julian Schwinger]] (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1965), [[Martin Lewis Perl|Martin Perl]] (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1995), [[Demetrios Christodoulou]],  [[Dennis Sciama]], [[Gerard 't Hooft]] (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1999), [[Robert Wald]], [[John Archibald Wheeler]] and [[Frank Wilczek]] (Nobel Prize in Physics, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gravityresearchfoundation.org/winners_name.html#s GRF Award Winning Essays] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228174605/http://www.gravityresearchfoundation.org/winners_name.html |date=2012-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monuments ==
In the 1960s, Babson gave grants to a number of colleges that were accompanied by stone monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2011-03/gravitys-sworn-enemy-roger-babson-and-gravity-research-foundation Popular Science: "Gravity's Sworn Enemy"]&lt;/ref&gt; The monuments are inscribed with a variety of similar sayings, such as "It is to remind students of the blessings forthcoming when a semi-insulator is discovered in order to harness gravity as a free power and reduce airplane accidents" and "It is to remind students of the blessings forthcoming when science determines what gravity is, how it works, and how it may be controlled."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oddthingsiveseen.com/2010/03/anti-gravity-monuments.html Anti-Gravity Monuments (report of visit)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Source: George Rideout, Jr. President, Gravity Research Foundation, personal email to dpbsmith---&gt;

Hobart College's "H-Book" contains a description of the circumstances surrounding the placement of its Gravity Monument: &lt;!--Alas, the inscription on the stone is not legible in low-res image in the online document---&gt; "The location of the stone on campus was linked to a gift to the Colleges of 'gravity grant' stocks, now totaling more than $1 million, from Roger Babson, the founder of Babson College. The eccentric Babson was intrigued by the notion of anti-gravity and inclined to further scientific research in this area. The Colleges used these funds to help construct Rosenberg Hall in 1994. Two trees that shade the stone are said to be direct descendants of Newton’s famous apple tree."

The stone at Colby College was once in front of the Keyes Building on the main academic quadrangle but was moved to a more obscure location near the Schair-Swenson-Watson Alumni Center. Students would often knock it over in an ironic testament to gravity's power. At Tufts, the monument is the site of an "inauguration ceremony"&lt;ref&gt;[http://cosmos.phy.tufts.edu/ceremony/Christian.html Tufts "inauguration ceremony']&lt;/ref&gt; for students who receive [[Ph.D.]]s in [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]], in which a thesis advisor drops an apple on the student's head.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3629">A '''ground effect train''' is an alternative to a [[magnetic levitation train|magnetic levitation (maglev) train]]. In both cases the objective is to prevent the vehicle from making contact with the ground. Whereas a maglev train accomplishes this through the use of [[magnetism]], a [[Ground effect vehicle|ground effect]] train uses an air cushion; either in the manner of a [[hovercraft]] (as in [[hovertrain]]s){{citation needed|date=July 2013|reason=since a hovercraft isn't a subcategory of ground-effect vehicle, how could hovertrain be a subcategory of ground-effect train?}} or using the "[[Ground effect vehicle|wing-in-ground]]" design.

The advantages of a ground effect train over a maglev are lower cost due to simpler construction. Disadvantages include either constant input of energy to keep the train hovering (in the case of hovercraft-like vehicles) or the necessity to keep the vehicle moving for it to remain off the ground (in the case of Wing In Ground effect vehicles). Furthermore, these vehicles may be very drastically affected by wind, air [[turbulence]], and weather. Whereas the magnetic levitation train can be built to operate in a vacuum to minimise air resistance, the ground effect train must operate in an atmosphere in order for the air cushion to exist.

Development work has been undertaken in several countries since the middle 20th century. No ground effect train has entered regular commercial service.

A '''HangBoard''' is a device used in the snow sport of hangboarding.

HangBoard development began in 2001, invented by Canadian [[Don Arney]]. Others involved in the development process were Canadian designer Peter Brooke and American designer Charles Buchwald, and Canadian snowboard and mountain biking champion Everest MacDonald.

A HangBoard bolts to a standard [[snowboard]] in place of bindings, and the pilot — wearing a harness — hangs from a T-shaped bar. Arms push against handlebars in the front, and feet clamp into rudders at the back.  Most control occurs by weight shifting, but pilots can also achieve directional control by using the foot rudders.  Applied simultaneously, the rudders function as brakes.  The HangBoard frame is made of aircraft aluminum, weighs less than 11&amp;nbsp;kg without the snowboard, and measures {{convert|160|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|32|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} high when folded up, and {{convert|47|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide.

HangBoard pilots ride the [[ski lift]]s and descend the mountains like skiers and snowboarders. When loading onto a ski lift, the chair catches the upper part of the HangBoard, which then rests on the seat beside the pilot. A tether ensures the board cannot escape the lift.
When departing the lift, the pilot holds onto the HangBoard's upper frame.

HangBoard development began in 2001, invented by Canadian Don Arney. Others involved in the development process were Canadian designer Peter Brooke and American designer Charles Buchwald, and Canadian snowboard and mountain biking champion Everest MacDonald.

'''Hans Weinreich''' (1480/1490 – 1566) was a publisher and printer of German and Polish language books in the first half of the sixteenth century. Weinreich was originally from Danzig (Gdańsk) in [[Royal Prussia]], [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]], and then moved to [[Königsberg]] (Królewiec) in [[Ducal Prussia]] at the invitation of [[Albert, Duke of Prussia|Albert of Prussia]].

==Biography==
Weinreich was most likely born in Danzig sometime between 1480 and 1490, to a well-to-do family. His grandfather shared his name and had four sons, of whom one was Hans' father.&lt;ref name="Bock"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Die Anfänge des polnischen Buchdrucks in Königsberg.

Weinreich's printshop in Königsberg was supposedly located by the castle steps in the city's Old Town.&lt;ref name="fudge"&gt;{{cite book | title=Commerce and Print in the Early Reformation | publisher=Brill | author=Fudge, John | year=2007 | pages=54 | isbn=9004156623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printing activity==

Weinreich issued his first works in either 1512 or 1513 and moved to Königsberg in 1524.&lt;ref name="Bock"/&gt; In 1524 he began issuing works in Polish. In 1530 Weinreich published the first translation of [[Luther's Small Catechism]] made by an anonymous author.  However, the language of the translation was poor, and in 1533 Weinreich printed a second edition made by the Polish philologist [[Liboriusz Schadlika]].&lt;ref name="Bock"/&gt; Weinreich also issued several works by the Polish Lutheran theologian and translator [[Jan Seklucjan]], although some of these were actually translations done by [[Stanisław Murzynowski]]. The published works were translations into Polish of the [[New Testament]] and the [[Catechism]], as well as literature and song books. Seklucjan's works printed by Weinreich included the first Polish language hymnal.&lt;ref name="music"&gt;{{cite book | title=The History of Music in Poland: The Renaissance | publisher=Sutkowski Edition Warsaw | author=Sutkowski, Stefan | year=2002 | location=Warsaw | pages=113 | isbn=8391703517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weinreich also printed the first [[Lithuanian language]] and [[Old Prussian language]] books while in Königsberg, with the former being a translation of Martin Luther's Catechism by [[Martynas Mažvydas]]. The first [[print run]] of Mažvydas' work numbered between 200 and 300, although only one known copy has survived.&lt;ref name="ox"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Oxford companion to the book, Volume 1 | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Suarez, Michael Felix | author2= Woudhuysen, H.

Between 1524 and 1553 Weinreich printed 103 works, of which 59 were in German, 27 in Latin, 13 in Polish and four in either Prussian or Lithuanian.

'''High-definition video''' is video of higher [[display resolution|resolution]] and quality than [[Standard-definition television|standard-definition]].  While there is no standardized meaning for ''high-definition'', generally any video image with considerably more than 480 vertical lines (North America) or 576 vertical lines (Europe) is considered high-definition.  480 scan lines is generally the minimum even though the majority of systems greatly exceed that.  Images of standard resolution captured at rates faster than normal (60 frames/second North America, 50 fps Europe), by a [[high-speed camera]] may be considered high-definition in some contexts. Some television series shot on high-definition video are made to look as if they have been shot on [[film camera|film]], a technique which is often known as [[filmizing]].

== History ==
The first electronic scanning format, [[405-line television system|405 lines]], was the first "high definition" television system, since the mechanical systems it replaced had far fewer. From 1939, Europe and the US tried 605 and [[441-line television system|441 lines]] until, in 1941, the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] mandated 525 for the US. In wartime France, René Barthélemy tested higher resolutions, up to 1,042. In late 1949, official French transmissions finally began with [[Analog high-definition television system#French 819-line .28737i.29 system|819]]. In 1984, however, this standard was abandoned for 625-line color on the [[TF1]] network.

=== 1980s ===
Modern HD specifications date to the early 1980s, when Japanese engineers developed the HighVision 1,125-line interlaced TV standard (also called [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|MUSE]]) that ran at 60 frames per second. The [[Sony HDVS]] system was presented at an international meeting of television engineers in [[Algiers]], April 1981 and Japan's [[NHK]] presented its analog HDTV system at a Swiss conference in 1983.

The NHK system was standardized in the United States as [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers]] (SMPTE) standard #240M in the early 1990s, but abandoned later on when it was replaced by a DVB analog standard. HighVision video is still usable for HDTV video interchange, but there is almost no modern equipment available to perform this function. Attempts at implementing HighVision as a 6&amp;nbsp;MHz broadcast channel were mostly unsuccessful. All attempts at using this format for terrestrial TV transmission were abandoned by the mid-1990s.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Europe developed [[HD-MAC]] (1,250 lines, 50&amp;nbsp;Hz), a member of the [[Multiplexed Analogue Components|MAC]] family of hybrid analogue/digital video standards; however, it never took off as a terrestrial video transmission format. HD-MAC was never designated for video interchange except by the [[European Broadcasting Union]].

The current high-definition video standards in North America were developed during the course of the advanced television process initiated by the Federal Communications Commission in 1987 at the request of American broadcasters. In essence, the end of the 1980s was a death knell for most analog high definition technologies that had developed up to that time.

=== 1990s ===
The FCC process, led by the [[Advanced Television Systems Committee]] (ATSC) adopted a [[ATSC Standards|range of standards]] from interlaced 1,080-line video (a technical descendant of the original analog NHK 1125/30&amp;nbsp;Hz system) with a maximum frame rate of 30&amp;nbsp;Hz, (60 fields per second) and 720-line video, progressively scanned, with a maximum frame rate of 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.
In the end, however, the [[Digital Video Broadcast|DVB]] standard of resolutions (1080, 720, 480) and respective frame rates (24, 25, 30) were adopted in conjunction with the Europeans that were also involved in the same standardization process. The FCC officially adopted the [[ATSC]] transmission standard (which included both HD and [[SD video]] standards) in 1996, with the first broadcasts on October 28, 1998.

=== 2000s ===
In the early 2000s, it looked as if DVB would be the video standard far into the future. However, both Brazil and China have adopted alternative standards for high-definition video{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} that preclude the interoperability that was hoped for after decades of largely non-interoperable analog TV broadcasting.

== Technical details ==
[[Image:Vector Video Standards2.svg|thumb|This chart shows the most [[List of common resolutions|common display resolutions]], with the color of each resolution type indicating the display ratio (e.g., red indicates a 4:3 ratio). ]]
High definition video (prerecorded and broadcast) is defined threefold, by:
*''The number of lines in the vertical [[display resolution]]''.  High-definition television (HDTV) resolution is 1,080 or 720 lines. In contrast, regular [[digital television]] (DTV) is 480 lines (upon which NTSC is based, 480 visible scanlines out of 525) or 576 lines (upon which PAL/SECAM are based, 576 visible scanlines out of 625). However, since HD is broadcast digitally, its introduction sometimes coincides with the introduction of DTV. Additionally, current DVD quality is not high-definition, although the high-definition disc systems [[Blu-ray Disc]] and the [[HD DVD]] are.
*''The scanning system: [[progressive scan]]ning (p) or [[Interlaced video|interlaced scanning]] (i)''. ''Progressive scanning (p)'' redraws an image frame (all of its lines) when refreshing each image, for example 720p/1080p. ''Interlaced scanning (i)'' draws the image field every other line or "odd numbered" lines during the first image refresh operation, and then draws the remaining "even numbered" lines during a second refreshing, for example 1080i. Interlaced scanning yields &lt;!-- Why greater? In the case of 1080p and 1080i, the resolutions are the same. --&gt; image resolution if subject is not moving, but loses up to half of the resolution and suffers "combing" artifacts when subject is moving.
*''The number of frames or fields per second ([[Hertz|Hz]]). In Europe more common (50 [[hertz|Hz]]) television broadcasting system and in USA (60 [[hertz|Hz]])''. The 720p60 format is 1,280&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;720 [[pixel]]s, progressive encoding with 60 frames per second (60&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]]). The 1080i50/1080i60 format is 1920&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;1080 pixels, interlaced encoding with 50/60 fields, (50/60 [[hertz|Hz]])  per second. Two interlaced fields formulate a single frame, because the two fields of one frame are temporally shifted. Frame [[telecine|pulldown]] and segmented frames are special techniques that allow transmitting full frames by means of interlaced video stream.

Often, the rate is inferred from the context, usually assumed to be either 50 [[hertz|Hz]] (Europe) or 60 [[hertz|Hz]] (USA), except for [[1080p]], which denotes 1080p24, 1080p25, and 1080p30, but also 1080p50 and 1080p60.

A [[Frame rate|frame]] or field rate can also be specified without a resolution. For example, 24p means 24 progressive scan frames per second and 50i means 25 progressive frames per second, consisting of 50 interlaced fields per second. Most HDTV systems support some standard resolutions and frame or field rates. The most common are noted below.
High-definition signals require a high-definition television or computer monitor in order to be viewed. High-definition video has an aspect ratio of 16:9 (1.78:1). The aspect ratio of regular widescreen film shot today is typically 1.85:1 or 2.39:1 (sometimes traditionally quoted at 2.35:1). Standard-definition television (SDTV) has a 4:3 (1.33:1) aspect ratio, although in recent years many broadcasters have transmitted programs "squeezed" horizontally in 16:9 [[Anamorphic widescreen|anamorphic format]], in hopes that the viewer has a 16:9 set which stretches the image out to normal-looking proportions, or a set which "squishes" the image vertically to present a "letterbox" view of the image, again with correct proportions.

=== Common high-definition video modes ===

|}
Note: &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Image is either a frame or, in case of interlaced scanning, two fields. (EVEN and ODD)

Also, there are less common but still popular [[Ultra wide television|UltraWide]] resolutions, such as 2560×1080p (1080p UltraWide).

== HD content ==
High-definition image sources include terrestrial broadcast, direct broadcast satellite, digital cable, high definition disc ([[Blu-ray Disc|BD]]), digital cameras, Internet downloads, and video game consoles.

*Most computers are capable of HD or higher resolutions over [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]], [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], [[HDMI]] and/or [[DisplayPort]].
*The optical disc standard [[Blu-ray Disc]] can provide enough digital storage to store hours of HD video content. Digital Versatile Discs or DVDs (that hold 4.7 [[Gigabyte|GB]] for a Single layer or 8.5 GB for a Double layer), are not always up to the challenge of today's high-definition (HD) sets. Storing and playing HD movies requires a disc that holds more information, like a Blu-ray Disc (which hold 25 GB in single layer form and 50 GB for double layer) or the now defunct High Definition Digital Versatile Discs (HD DVDs) which held 15 GB or 30 GB in, respectively, single and double layer variations.

Blu-ray Discs were jointly developed by 9 initial partners including Sony and Phillips (which jointly developed CDs for audio), and Pioneer (which developed its own Laser-disc previously with some success) among others. HD-DVD discs were primarily developed by Toshiba and NEC with some backing from Microsoft, Warner Bros., Hewlett Packard, and others. On February 19, 2008 Toshiba announced it was abandoning the format and would discontinue development, marketing and manufacturing of HD-DVD players and drives.

=== Types of recorded media ===
The high resolution [[photographic film]] used for cinema projection is exposed at the rate of 24 frames per second but usually projected at 48, each frame getting projected twice helping to minimise flicker. One exception to this was the 1986 [[National Film Board of Canada]] short film ''[[Momentum (IMAX film)|Momentum]]'', which briefly experimented with both filming and projecting at 48 frame/s, in a process known as [[IMAX#HD|IMAX HD]].

Depending upon available bandwidth and the amount of detail and movement in the image, the optimum format for video transfer is either 720p24 or 1080p24. When shown on television in PAL system countries, film must be projected at the rate of 25 frames per second by accelerating it by 4.1 percent. In NTSC standard countries, the projection rate is 30 frames per second, using a technique called 3:2 pull-down. One film frame is held for three video fields (1/20 of a second), and the next is held for two video fields (1/30 of a second) and then the process is repeated, thus achieving the correct film projection rate with two film frames shown in 1/12 of a second. {{See also|Telecine|Deinterlacing}}

Older (pre-HDTV) recordings on video tape such as [[Betacam]] SP are often either in the form 480i60 or 576i50. These may be upconverted to a higher resolution format ([[720i]]), but removing the interlace to match the common [[720p]] format may distort the picture or require filtering which actually reduces the resolution of the final output.

Non-cinematic HDTV video recordings are recorded in either the [[720p]] or the [[1080i]] format. The format used is set by the broadcaster (if for television broadcast). In general, 720p is more accurate with fast action, because it progressively scans frames, instead of the 1080i, which uses interlaced fields and thus might degrade the resolution of fast images.

720p is used more for Internet distribution of high-definition video, because computer monitors progressively scan; 720p video has lower storage-decoding requirements than either the 1080i or the 1080p. This is also the medium for high-definition broadcasts around the world and 1080p is used for [[Blu-ray]] movies.

=== HD in filmmaking ===
Film as a medium has inherent limitations, such as difficulty of viewing footage while recording, and suffers other problems, caused by poor film development/processing, or poor monitoring systems. Given that there is increasing use of computer-generated or computer-altered imagery in movies, and that editing picture sequences is often done digitally, some directors have shot their movies using the HD format via high-end digital video cameras. While the quality of HD video is very high compared to SD video, and offers improved signal/noise ratios against comparable sensitivity film, film remains able to resolve more image detail than current HD video formats. In addition some films have a wider dynamic range (ability to resolve extremes of dark and light areas in a scene) than even the best HD cameras. Thus the most persuasive arguments for the use of HD are currently cost savings on film stock and the ease of transfer to editing systems for special effects.

Depending on the year and format in which a movie was filmed, the exposed image can vary greatly in size. Sizes range from as big as 24&amp;nbsp;mm × 36&amp;nbsp;mm for [[VistaVision]]/[[Technirama]] 8 perforation cameras (same as 35&amp;nbsp;mm still photo film) going down through 18&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;24&amp;nbsp;mm for Silent Films or Full Frame 4 perforations cameras to as small as 9&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;21&amp;nbsp;mm in Academy Sound Aperture cameras modified for the Techniscope 2 perforation format. Movies are also produced using other [[film gauge]]s, including [[70 mm film]]s (22&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;48&amp;nbsp;mm) or the rarely used 55&amp;nbsp;mm and [[Cinerama|CINERAMA]].

The four major [[List of film formats|film formats]] provide pixel resolutions (calculated from pixels per millimeter) roughly as follows:

*Academy Sound (Sound movies before 1955): 15&amp;nbsp;mm × 21&amp;nbsp;mm (1.375) = 2,160&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2,970
*Academy camera US Widescreen: 11&amp;nbsp;mm × 21&amp;nbsp;mm (1.85) = 1,605 × 2,970
*Current Anamorphic Panavision ("Scope"): 17.5&amp;nbsp;mm × 21&amp;nbsp;mm (2.39) = 2,485&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2,970
*Super-35 for Anamorphic prints: 10&amp;nbsp;mm × 24&amp;nbsp;mm (2.39) = 1,420&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3,390

In the process of making prints for exhibition, this negative is copied onto other film (negative → interpositive → internegative → print) causing the resolution to be reduced with each emulsion copying step and when the image passes through a lens (for example, on a projector). In many cases, the resolution can be reduced down to 1/6 of the original negative's resolution (or worse).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Note that resolution values for 70&amp;nbsp;mm film are higher than those listed above.

=== HD on the World Wide Web/HD streaming ===
A number of online video streaming/on demand and digital download services offer HD video, among them [[YouTube]], [[Vimeo]], [[Hulu]], [[Amazon Video|Amazon Video On Demand]], [[Netflix#Watch Instantly|Netflix Watch Instantly]], and others. Due to heavy compression, the image detail produced by these formats are far below that of broadcast HD, and often even inferior to [[DVD-Video]] (3-9&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s MP2) [[video scaler|upscaled]] to the same image size.&lt;ref name="fake HD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/ou/why-hd-movie-downloads-are-a-big-lie/511|title=Why HD movie downloads are a big lie|date=2007-05-31|accessdate=2010-06-28|publisher=Ziff-Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a chart of numerous online services and their HD offering:

=== HD in video surveillance ===
An increasing number of manufacturers of security cameras now offer HD cameras. The need for high resolution, color fidelity, and frame rate is acute for surveillance purposes to ensure that the quality of the video output is of an acceptable standard that can be used both for preventative surveillance as well as for evidence purposes. These needs, however, must be balanced against the additional storage capacity required by HD video.

=== HD in video gaming ===
Both the [[PlayStation 3]] [[game console]] and [[Xbox 360]] can output native 1080p through [[HDMI]] or component cables, but the systems have few games which appear in 1080p; most games only run natively at 720p or less, but can be upscaled to 1080p. The [[Wii]] can output up to 480p ([[Enhanced-definition television|enhanced-definition]]) over component, which while not HD, is very useful for HDTVs as it avoids de-interlacing artifacts. The Wii can also output 576i in [[PAL]] regions.

Visually, native 1080p produces a sharper and clearer picture compared to upscaled 1080p. Though only a handful of games available have the [[native resolution]] of 1080p, all games on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 can be upscaled up to this resolution. Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games are labeled with the output resolution on the back of their packaging, although on Xbox 360 this indicates the resolution it will upscale to, not the native resolution of the game.

Generally, [[Personal computer game|PC games]] are only limited by the display's resolution size.  Drivers are capable of supporting very high resolutions, depending on the chipset of the video card.  Many game engines support resolutions of 5760×1080 or 5760×1200 (typically achieved with three 1080p displays in a [[multi-monitor]] setup) and nearly all will display 1080p at minimum. 1440p and 4K are typically supported resolutions for PC gaming as well.

Currently all consoles, Nintendo's [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo Switch]], Microsoft's [[Xbox One]], and [[PlayStation 4]] display games 1080p natively. The Nintendo Switch is an unusual case, due to its hybrid nature as both a home console and a handheld: the built-in screen displays games at 720p maximum, but the console can natively display imagery at 1080p when docked. PlayStation 4 is able to display in 4K, though strictly only for displaying pictures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6051">'''High-redundancy actuation''' (HRA) is a new approach to [[fault-tolerant control]] in the area of mechanical actuation.

==Overview==
The basic idea is to use a lot of small actuation elements, so that a fault of one element has only a minor effect on the overall system.  This way, a High Redundancy Actuator can remain functional even after several elements are at fault.  This property is also called [[graceful degradation]].

Fault-tolerant operation in the presence of actuator faults requires some form of redundancy. Actuators are essential, because they are used to keep the system stable and to bring it into the desired state. Both requires a certain amount of power or force to be
applied to the system. No control approach can work unless the actuators produce this necessary force.

So the common solution is to err on the side of safety by over-actuation: much more control action than strictly necessary is built into the system. For critical systems, the normal approach involves straightforward replication of the actuators. Often three or four actuators are used in parallel for aircraft flight control systems, even if one would be
sufficient from a control point of view. So if one actuator fails, the remaining actuator can always keep the system operation. While this approach certainly successful, it also makes the system expensive, heavy and ineffective.

===Inspiration of high-redundancy actuation===
The idea of the high-redundancy actuation (HRA) is inspired by the human musculature. A muscle is composed of many individual muscle cells, each of which provides only a minute contribution to the force and the travel of the muscle. These properties allow the muscle as a whole to be highly resilient to damage of individual cells.

==Technical realisation==
The aim of high redundancy actuation is not to produce man-made muscles, but to use the same principle of cooperation in technical actuator's to provide intrinsic fault tolerance. To achieve this, a high number of small actuator elements are assembled in parallel and in series to form one actuator (see [[Series and parallel circuits]]).

Faults within the actuator will affect the maximum capability, but through robust control, full performance can be maintained without either adaptation or reconfiguration. Some form of [[condition monitoring]] is necessary to provide warnings to the operator calling for
[[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]]. But this monitoring has no influence on the system itself, unlike in adaptive methods or [[control reconfiguration]], which simplifies the design of the system significantly.

:[[File:HRA-configurations.gif]]

The HRA is an important new approach within the overall area of fault-tolerant control,
using concepts of [[reliability engineering]] on a mechanical level. When applicable, it can provide actuators that have graceful degradation, and that continue to operate at close to nominal performance even in the presence of multiple faults in the actuator elements.

===Using actuation elements in series===
An important feature of the high-redundancy actuation is that the actuator elements are connected both in parallel and in series. While the parallel arrangement is commonly used, the configuration in series is rarely employed, because it is perceived to be less efficient.

However, there is one fault that is difficult to deal with in a parallel arrangement: the locking up of one actuator element. Because parallel actuator elements always have the same extension, one locked-up element can render the whole assembly useless. It is possible to mitigate this by guarding the elements against locking or by limiting the force exerted by a single element. But these measures reduce both the effectiveness of the system and introduce new points of failure.

The analysis of the serial configuration shows that it remains operational when one element is locked-up. This fact is important for the High Redundancy Actuator, as fault tolerance is required for different fault types. The goal of the HRA project is to use parallel and serial actuator elements to accommodate both the blocking and the inactivity (loss of force) of an element.

===Available technology===
The basic idea of high-redundancy actuation is technology agnostic: it should be applicable to a wide range of actuator technology, including different kinds of [[linear actuator]]s and rotational actuators.

However, initial experiments are performed with [[electric actuator]]s, especially with electromechanical and electromagnetic technology. Compared to [[pneumatic actuator]]s, the electrical drive allow a much finer control of position and force.

The '''HomeLink Wireless Control System''' is a [[radio frequency]] (RF) [[transmitter]] integrated into some [[automobile]]s that can be programmed to activate devices such as [[garage door opener]]s, [[Wireless light switch|RF-controlled lighting]], gates and locks, including those with [[rolling code]]s.

The system features three buttons, most often found on the driver-side visor or on the overhead console, which can be programmed via a training sequence to replace existing remote controls.  It is compatible with most RF-controlled garage door openers, as well as [[home automation]] systems such as those based on the [[X10 (industry standard)|X10]] protocol.

It won the [[PACE Award]] in 1997, for supplying automotive technology to improve interaction between the consumer, the car, and home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[international standard]] '''IEC 62304''' – [[medical device]] software – [[software life cycle]] processes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical device software –  Software life cycle processes|url=http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec62304%7Bed1.0%7Den_d.pdf|work=INTERNATIONAL IEC STANDARD 62304 First  edition 2006-05|publisher=International Electrotechnical Commission|accessdate=2 June 2012|author=International Electrotechnical Commission|format=PDF|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a standard which specifies life cycle requirements for the development of [[medical software]] and software within medical devices. It is harmonized by the European Union (EU)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104013821/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/european-standards/harmonised-standards/medical-devices/|title=Medical devices - European standards - Enterprise and Industry|date=2012-11-04|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States (US),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recognized Consensus Standards|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/detail.cfm?standard__identification_no=30279|work=FDA US Food and Drug Administration|publisher=US Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=26 January 2015|author=Staff|date=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore can be used as a [[Gold standard (test)|benchmark]] to [[Regulatory compliance|comply with regulatory requirements]] from both these [[Market (economics)|markets]].

== Implications of IEC 62304 for software ==
The IEC 62304 standard calls out certain cautions on using software, particularly SOUP ([[software of unknown pedigree]] or provenance). The standard spells out a risk-based decision model on when the use of SOUP is acceptable, and defines testing requirements for SOUP to support a rationale on why such software should be used.&lt;ref name="emdt"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.mddionline.com/article/developing-medical-device-software-iec-62304 |title=Developing Medical Device Software to IEC 62304 |last=Hall |first=Ken |work=EMDT - European Medical Device Technology |date=June 1, 2010 |accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Levi's Stadium from air.jpg|thumb|Levi's Stadium from a tower at [[California's Great America]] theme park.]]
'''Levi's Stadium''' is a [[American football|football]] stadium located in [[Santa Clara, California]], in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. It has served as the home venue for the [[National Football League]] (NFL)'s [[San Francisco 49ers]] since 2014. The stadium is located approximately {{Convert|40|mi}} south of San Francisco and is named for [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]], which purchased [[naming rights]] in 2013.

In 2006, the 49ers initially proposed constructing a new stadium at [[Candlestick Point State Recreation Area|Candlestick Point]] in [[San Francisco]], the site of their existing home, [[Candlestick Park]]. The project, which included plans for retail space and housing improvements, was claimed to be of great potential benefit to the nearby historically [[blight (urban)|blighted]] neighborhood of [[Hunters Point, San Francisco, California|Hunters Point]]. After negotiations with the city of San Francisco fell through, the 49ers focused their attention on a site adjacent to their administrative offices and training facility in Santa Clara.

In June 2010, Santa Clara voters approved a measure authorizing the creation of the Santa Clara Stadium Authority, a  tax-exempt public authority, to build and own the new football stadium and for the city government to lease land to the Santa Clara Stadium Authority.&lt;ref name=Goldman&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/la-fi-stadium-goldman-20150524-story.html |title=In stadium financing game, Goldman Sachs dominates|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 23, 2015|first=Tim |last=Logan}}&lt;/ref&gt; A construction loan, raised from private investors, was secured in December 2011, allowing construction to start in April 2012.&lt;ref name="mercurynews.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=49ers' Kick Off Move to Santa Clara With Far-From-Traditional Groundbreaking|first=Mike|last=Rosenberg|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/southbayfootball/ci_20434376/49ers-break-ground-this-evening-stadium-at-center|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=April 19, 2012|accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levi's Stadium opened on July 17, 2014.&lt;ref name="mercurynews.com" /&gt;

Levi's Stadium hosted [[Super Bowl 50]] on February 7, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=San Francisco Awarded Super Bowl L; Houston Lands LI|first=Gregg|last=Rosenthal|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000205086/article/san-francisco-awarded-super-bowl-l-houston-lands-li|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=May 21, 2013|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Naranjo|first=Candice|title=The Super Bowl is Coming to Levi’s Stadium in 2016|url=http://news.kron4.com/news/the-super-bowl-is-coming-to-levis-stadium-in-2016/|publisher=KRON 4|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levi's Stadium also serves as the site of the [[Pac-12 Football Championship Game]] since 2014. Previously, the game was played at the home stadium of the division winner with the better record entering the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000350321/article/pac12-to-move-football-championship-game-to-levis-stadium |title=Pac-12 to move football championship game to Levi's Stadium |author=Bryan Fischer |date= May 14, 2014 |publisher=NFL.com |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pac-12 announces deal to host Football Championship Game at Levi's Stadium |url=http://pac-12.com/article/2014/05/15/pac-12-announces-deal-host-football-championship-game-levis-stadium |date=May 15, 2014 |publisher=[[Pac-12 Conference]] |work=Pac-12.Com |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stadium design==
The stadium was designed by [[HNTB]], an internationally renowned architectural firm, with a focus on creating a multi-purpose venue and with the fan experience and green technology as top priorities. Civil engineering work was performed by [[Winzler &amp; Kelly]], which was acquired by [[GHD Group]] in 2011. Commissioning services were provided by Glumac.

===Basic stadium features===
Levi's Stadium is designed as an open stadium with a natural grass field. It has a seating capacity of 68,500, expandable to approximately 75,000 to host major events like the [[Super Bowl]] and the [[FIFA World Cup]]. However, on June 27, 2015, The Grateful Dead Fare Thee Well Tour made history by extending the stadium to 83,000 in attendance. The seating design of the stadium places approximately two-thirds of the fans in the lower bowl, which is one of the largest of its kind in the entire NFL. The design features significantly improved accessibility and seating options for fans with special needs and disabilities when compared to Candlestick Park. The configuration is similar to [[Ford Field]], home of the NFL's [[Detroit Lions]], with the majority of the [[luxury box|luxury suites]] on one side of the field, which puts the fans in the upper deck closer to the action.

As a multi-use facility, the stadium can be configured for special touring events including concerts, motocross events, indoor/outdoor conferences, and other community events. The stadium is also designed to meet the FIFA field geometry requirements for international soccer, which will allow it to host international friendly matches and major tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup. The stadium will also feature over {{convert|109000|sqft|m2}} of flexible premium meeting space in the club areas.&lt;ref name="Yes on J"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stadium Design |url=http://www.santaclarastadiumfacts.com/images/stories/Stadium+Design+Measure+J.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306015445/http://www.santaclarastadiumfacts.com/images/stories/Stadium%2BDesign%2BMeasure%2BJ.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 6, 2012 |publisher=Santa Clara Stadium |date=April 20, 2010 |accessdate=April 20, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
====Stadium app====
The stadium has created an in stadium app designed specifically for home football games for the 49ers to provide a better fan experience for fans and guests. The app can be downloaded for free off of the App Store and Google Play. Features are limited on non-football game days or if one is outside the vicinity of the stadium. However, when having the app within the stadium on game and event days one has many options including in-seat delivery, live streaming, navigation and much more. The app can be extended to other events hosted by the stadium if the third party would like to include its features for their guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stadium Mobile App|url=http://www.levisstadium.com/stadium-app/|website=levisstadium.com|publisher=Levi's Stadium|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Issues with the turf====
The stadium has had repeated problems with the grass surface, including the grass collapsing under [[Baltimore Ravens]] kicker [[Justin Tucker]] during a week 6 game in 2015. This has led to concern that the stadium wasn't of a high enough caliber to host a high stakes game such as the [[Super Bowl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cull|first1=Ian|title=More Levi's Stadium Turf Concerns After Ravens Kicker Slips During Field Goal Attempt|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/More-Levis-Stadium-Turf-Concerns-After-Ravens-Kicker-Slips-During-Field-Goal-Attempt-334369851.html|website=nbcbayarea.com|publisher=KNTV|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problems with the turf were mentioned the day after the Super Bowl by [[Denver Broncos]] cornerback [[Aqib Talib]] who said "The footing on the field was terrible. San Fran (the 49ers) has to play eight games on that field, so they better do something to get it fixed. It was terrible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cull|first1=Ian|title=Broncos CB Aqib Talib says 'footing on field terrible' for Super Bowl|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14738498/super-bowl-50-aqib-talib-denver-broncos-calls-levi-stadium-turf-terrible|website=espn.go.com|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental sustainability===
Stadium proponents and those who expect to profit from the construction of the stadium claim that the stadium is currently one of the largest buildings registered with the U.S. Green Building Council. It is also believed to be the first stadium that will have both a green roof and solar panels. The 49ers are exploring collaborative opportunities with the Environmental Protection Agency to explore environmentally friendly components including:&lt;ref name="Yes on J"/&gt;

* Use of an outside commissioning agent to verify that energy‐related systems are installed, calibrated, and performing in compliance with the project requirements
* Use of public transit nearby including [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|VTA]], [[Altamont Corridor Express|ACE]], [[Amtrak]], with connection to a proposed future [[Silicon Valley BART extension|BART]] extension
* Construction of a green roof (27,000± sf) and photovoltaic panels (20,000± sf)
* Use of paving materials and roofing materials with a high solar reflectance index
* Use of recycled water for landscape irrigation, toilets, and urinals along with water‐conserving fixtures
* No use of CFC‐based refrigerants in the HVAC systems. Systems will instead use refrigerants that minimize compounds that contribute to ozone depletion
* Installation of permanent monitoring systems that provide feedback on ventilation system performance
* Diversion, recycling, and/or salvaging 75% of non‐hazardous construction waste
* Use of controllable and programmable lighting control systems and thermal comfort control systems

Levi's Stadium received a Gold LEED ([[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]]) Certificate. It is the first professional football stadium in the United States to receive this certification as new construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.levisstadium.com/2014/07/stadium-becomes-first-us-venue-kind-earn-leed-gold-certification/|title=Stadium Becomes First US Venue of Its Kind To Earn LEED Gold Certification - Levi's® Stadium|date=July 22, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===

====Public transit====
Stadium patrons have the option of riding [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority Light Rail|VTA Light Rail]] (Valley Transportation Authority) to the stadium. The closest light rail station is the [[Great America (VTA)|Great America]] station, which is located just west of the stadium in the median of Tasman Drive.

To the east, other transit options include the VTA [[Lick Mill (VTA)|Lick Mill station]] (also in the Tasman median) as well as the [[Amtrak]] and [[Altamont Corridor Express|ACE]] [[Santa Clara – Great America Station|station]] near [[California's Great America]].

====Walking and bicycling====
[[File:San Tomas Aquino Creek and Levi's Stadium.JPG|thumb|right|[[San Tomas Aquino Creek]] next to Levi's Stadium]]
Levi's Stadium was constructed immediately east of the San Tomas Aquino Trail, a paved multi-use path installed by the City of Santa Clara in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Tomas Aquino/Saratoga Creek Trail Connector|url=http://www.baytrail.org/STA-SC.htm|website=San Francisco Bay Trail|publisher=Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG)|accessdate=13 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930234800/http://www.baytrail.org/STA-SC.htm|archivedate=September 30, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; that connects to a continuous 100-mile network of off-street paths including the regional San Francisco Bay Trail. The city announced in March 2013 that the San Tomas Aquino Trail would be "temporarily detoured between Agnew Road and Tasman Drive for approximately 1 year starting April 15 and ending when the Stadium is open,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=San Tomas Aquino Creek Trail Temporary Detour|url=http://santaclaraca.gov/index.aspx?page=50&amp;recordid=2052|accessdate=13 April 2015|publisher=City of Santa Clara|date=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;" but this one-mile section of the trail remained closed to the public before and during stadium events since they began in August 2014, requiring the continued use of the two-mile on-street detour.

The stadium project's [http://santaclaraca.gov/index.aspx?page=1560 Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR)] disclosed no such ongoing temporary closures of the trail, but stated instead that "While there will likely be a sizeable increase in pedestrians on the San Tomas Aquino Creek trail before and after NFL events, the creek trail is open to both pedestrians and cyclists and there are no restrictions on use. Anyone at anytime can access and use the trail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=49ers Santa Clara Stadium Project Final Environmental Impact Report|url=http://santaclaraca.gov/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=12789|publisher=City of Santa Clara|accessdate=13 April 2015|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vehicular access====
The stadium's official mailing address is on Marie P DeBartolo Way (formerly Centennial Boulevard), which is actually a [[cul-de-sac]] on the east side of the stadium. The primary access route to the stadium is Tasman Drive, which runs along its northern side. Tasman is a major east-west [[arterial road]] which connects to [[Interstate 880]] several miles to the east. Both west and east of the stadium, Tasman intersects with various north-south arterial roads which connect to several important freeways, such as [[U.S. Route 101]], [[California State Route 237]], and [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]]. The closest and most important of those north-south roads is Great America Parkway to the west of the stadium, which is named after the theme park to the south.

===Naming rights===
On May 8, 2013, the 49ers announced that San Francisco-based [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]] purchased the naming rights to the new stadium. The deal calls for Levi's to pay $220.3 million to the city of Santa Clara and the 49ers over 20 years, with an option to extend the deal for another five years for around $75 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Levi's Stadium: 49ers' New Santa Clara Home Gets a Name in $220 Million Deal |first=Mike |last=Rosenberg |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/southbayfootball/ci_23198944/levis-stadium-49ers-new-santa-clara-home-gets?source=rss |newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]] |date=May 8, 2013 |accessdate=2014-07-22 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RGG74zIO?url=http://www.mercurynews.com/southbayfootball/ci_23198944/levis-stadium-49ers-new-santa-clara-home-gets |archivedate=July 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 14, 2015, ESPN's [[Chris Berman]] coined the name "The Big Bellbottom" in reference to the stadium. In a [[Deadspin]] article covering the 49ers on August 18, 2015, article writer Drew Magary coined the nickname "the Jeanhole" for the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadspin.com/why-your-team-sucks-2015-san-francisco-49ers-1724542048|title=Why Your Team Sucks 2015: San Francisco 49ers|first=Drew|last=Magary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Levi's Stadium has been praised for its excellent sightlines, beautiful architecture, plentiful amenities, technological advancements, convenient public transportation access, and environmental sustenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/place/article/Levi-s-Stadium-both-structurally-and-5752211.php|title=Levi's Stadium both structurally and architecturally impressive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the stadium has been heavily criticized for its highly corporate atmosphere and lack of a football atmosphere that Candlestick Park had. With the stadium having the most expensive ticket prices in the league during its inaugural season, many long-tenured and loyal fans that had contributed to the football atmosphere at Candlestick Park could not afford to buy season tickets with the added cost of the Stadium Builders License. Also, with the several distractions inside the stadium that include multiple bars and lounges, fans would often hang out in those places while the game is going on rather than watching the game from their seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2014/11/26/kawakami-49ers-not-getting-home-field-advantage-from-new-home/|title=Kawakami: 49ers not getting home-field advantage from new home|date=November 26, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levi's Stadium has received some backlash from season ticket holders, who are unhappy regarding rules that won’t allow them to print their tickets until 72 hours before the game, making re-sale very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kron4.com/2015/10/12/san-francisco-49ers-fans-voicing-frustration-about-levis-stadium/ |title=San Francisco 49ers fans voicing frustration about Levi's Stadium |author=Cestone, Vince |work=KRON4 |date=October 12, 2015 |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, older 49ers fans say that people are more segmented at Levi's Stadium in comparison to Candlestick Park, leaving [[Tailgate party|tailgaters]] with large expanses of empty parking stalls and a more desolate tailgating experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.sfgate.com/49ers/2015/12/10/generational-split-may-be-emerging-over-acceptance-of-levis-stadium/ |title=Generational slip may be emerging over acceptance of Levi's Stadium |author=Lynch, Kevin |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=December 10, 2015 |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Levi's Stadium has also received heavy criticism for the way fans are treated on hot days during early-season afternoon games. The majority of fans are seated on the east side of the stadium and during these afternoon games, they are exposed to the sun as there is no shade provided due to the lack of overhangs. With the climate of Santa Clara being much warmer than San Francisco, it makes watching games on hot days uncomfortable for fans as they are less accommodated for exposure to the sun than are patrons at other stadiums in hot-weather climates. Several fans suffered heat exhaustion during preseason and early season afternoon games. This has led to the eastern stands being largely empty on hot days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/49ers/ci_26669386/heat-takes-toll-49ers-fans-at-levis-stadium|title=Heat takes a toll on 49ers fans at Levi’s Stadium|date=October 5, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the result of the stadium being designed with the Candlestick Point site in mind and when the team decided to build it in Santa Clara instead, they kept the design intact in order to quickly get started on construction not taking the differences in climate into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ninerswire.usatoday.com/2017/09/11/report-49ers-considering-ways-to-add-shade-for-fans-at-levis-stadium/|title=Report: 49ers considering ways to add shade for fans at Levi's Stadium|date=2017-09-12|work=Niners Wire|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due regulations by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] for being in close proximity to the airport, they cannot add any more height to the stadium, while any additional overhangs would have to be structures, making it very difficult to fix the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.knbr.com/2018/08/09/49ers-say-they-cant-add-shade-at-levis-stadium-will-drop-price-of-bottled-water/|title=49ers say they can’t add shade at Levi’s Stadium, will drop price of bottled water|date=2018-08-12|work=KNBR|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pilots flying into [[San Jose International Airport]] have frequently complained of being blinded or disoriented by the lights from the light towers and scoreboards.  The stadium is directly in the flight path of one of the airport's runways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/Blinded-by-the-Lights-Levi-Stadium-Lights-May-Be-Airport-Safety-Hazard-328573831.html|title=Blinded by the Lights: Levi's Stadium Lights May Be Airport Safety Hazard|publisher=[[KNTV]]|author1=Jeremy Stock|author2=Michael Bott|author3=Jeremy Carroll|date=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bay Area NBC affiliate [[KNTV]], there have been at least 43 complaints about the lights since the stadium opened. In response, Santa Clara mayor [[Lisa Gillmor]] promised to work with the 49ers and the Stadium Authority to determine if the lights need to be recalibrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= Stock |first1= Stephen |last2= Bott |first2= Michael |last3= Carroll |first3= Jeremy |title= 'We Cannot Have a Major Incident': Santa Clara Mayor Wants Answers on Stadium Lights Distracting Pilots |date= 2016-11-17 |accessdate= 2017-02-26 |publisher= [[KNTV]] |url= http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/We-cannot-have-a-major-incident-Santa-Clara-Mayor-Wants-Answers-on-Stadium-Lights-Distracting-Pilots-401789205.html |quote= 'Now that you’ve given me this information, we're going to follow through to make sure if there's any recalibration that needs to take place, that it takes place,' Gillmor said. 'We cannot have a major incident happen at Levi's Stadium.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous plans==
The San Francisco 49ers played at Candlestick Park from [[1971 NFL season|1971]] to [[2013 NFL season|2013]]. The stadium was a sentimental fan favorite and housed all 5 Super Bowl Championship teams. It was, however, the oldest unrenovated stadium in the NFL and was beginning to show its age.

The 49ers pursued a new stadium since 1997, when a plan for a stadium and a mall at Candlestick Point passed a public vote. When the plans failed to move forward, the San Francisco 49ers presented an alternative plan on July 18, 2006, to construct a new 68,500-seat, open air stadium as part of a mixed use development featuring housing, commercial and retail space. In November 2006 the team announced that plans for a new stadium at Candlestick Point were not feasible, “citing extensive costs for infrastructure, parking accommodations and other changes that would cost more than the stadium itself”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=49ers to Leave Candlestick, Turn Focus to Santa Clara|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2654743|work=[[ESPN]]|date=April 20, 2010|accessdate=April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 49ers turned their focus to making Santa Clara the home to their new stadium.

===The 1997 plan===
San Francisco voters in 1997 approved $100 million in city spending to build a new stadium and an attached shopping mall at [[Candlestick Point]]. However, even after voter approval to grant economic help for the project, the stadium was not constructed. This was because owner [[Eddie DeBartolo, Jr.]] was facing legal troubles, which led him to surrender ownership of the team to his sister [[Denise DeBartolo York]] and brother-in-law [[John York]]. Mills Corporation, the company chosen by the 49ers, was unable to put together a plan to successfully construct a new stadium for the team.&lt;ref name="Selna"/&gt; NFL owners had gone as far as awarding the new stadium the rights to host [[Super Bowl XXXVII]]. When stadium plans stalled, the game went to [[San Diego]]'s [[Qualcomm Stadium]] instead.

For years, the city and team ownership were embattled over attempts to gain funding and a green-light for construction of a new stadium. None of these attempts proved to be successful. {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===The 2006 plan===
The city of San Francisco received a new incentive to get a new stadium built. [[Mayor of San Francisco|Mayor]] [[Gavin Newsom]] wanted to bring the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] to the city, and a new stadium would sweeten the city's proposal for selection by the [[United States Olympic Committee]] as the official US submission to the [[IOC]]. The announcement came in November 2006. It called for a new stadium that would be converted into a 68,600-seat stadium for the 49ers after the Olympics. The [[Olympic Village]] would be converted into low-income housing after the games were over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Newsom's Olympic Vision Sees New 49ers Stadium |first=Phillip |last=Matier |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/07/11/MNG03JT3ET1.DTL |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=July 11, 2006 |accessdate=January 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604141440/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2006%2F07%2F11%2FMNG03JT3ET1.DTL |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new stadium was to be built at Candlestick Point on land just southeast of Candlestick Park. The cost of the stadium would be $916 million. Lennar Corporation would build housing, retail, and office space around the stadium area.&lt;ref name="Selna"&gt;{{cite news |title=First Look at 49ers' Stadium Plan|first=Robert|last=Selna|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/07/18/BAGTVK0N891.DTL|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=July 18, 2006|accessdate=January 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, part of the area surrounding Candlestick Park was to be zoned for retail space and housing; the new 49ers stadium was to be combined with such elements, bringing much-needed attractions to the historically blighted neighborhood of [[Hunters Point, San Francisco, California|Hunters Point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SAN FRANCISCO / New neighborhood in Hunters Point is Near Ready to Build / First 1,500 Homes at Old Shipyard Called 'Hilltop Community'|first1=Robert|last1=Selna|first2=Heather|last2=Knight|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-11-10/bay-area/17319069_1_candlestick-point-lennar-corp-bayview-hunters-point|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=November 10, 2006|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium would be stocked with 150 luxury suites, 7,500 premium club seats, and an increased number of seats lower and closer to the field, called "bowl seating," potentially raising the 49ers franchise value up as much as $250 million and offering at least $300 million in advertising and concession deals, the majority of which from paid corporate naming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deluxe Stadium May Enrich 49ers|first=Mike|last=Swift|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/search/ci_4716566|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=November 24, 2006|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architectural design would be reminiscent of San Francisco buildings.

The project planning did not get off to a good start, however, with contention between the 49ers and the city of San Francisco over viable locations for the new stadium. Initially, the idea was to build a stadium in the parking lot of Candlestick Park and later demolish the aging stadium. Team ownership feared that construction of the village and the stadium would severely limit the amount of land available in Candlestick Point, creating a parking problem for fans and increasing traffic along the roads that link the stadium to the freeway. Moreover, with residents in the low-income housing by 2016, traffic would be permanently increased, further damaging the already-limited methods of transportation to the park.&lt;ref name="LetterTo49ersFaithful"&gt;{{cite web | title=Letter to 49ers Faithful | url=http://49ers.com/pressbox/news_detail.php?PRKey=2515 | author=Denise and John York | date=November 9, 2006 | publisher=San Francisco 49ers | accessdate=January 1, 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928071225/http://49ers.com/pressbox/news_detail.php?PRKey=2515 | archivedate=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With San Francisco slow to come up with better locations for the stadium or ways to circumvent the problems posed by construction at Candlestick Point, team owners [[Denise DeBartolo York]] and [[John York]] announced on November 9, 2006, that the 49ers were shifting their efforts to create a new stadium to the city of Santa Clara, home to the team offices and training facility since 1987, approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} south of San Francisco.&lt;ref name="LetterTo49ersFaithful" /&gt;

The sudden removal of the planned stadium forced the San Francisco Olympics bid group to cancel its proposal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title='Shocked' S.F. Group Drops Bid for 2016 Olympics | first=John | last=Crumpacker | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/11/14/MNG5JMCADR1.DTL&amp;hw=Olympics+San+Francisco&amp;sn=003&amp;sc=857 | newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=November 14, 2006 | accessdate=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which engendered great anger not only from Mayor Newsom, but also from such 49ers legends as [[Joe Montana]] and [[Ronnie Lott]], who were part of the effort to bring the Olympics to the Bay Area. In addition, many fans were outraged at the suggestion to move the 49ers out of the city that it had shared history with for decades. The Yorks insisted that the legacy of the franchise would be respected in the sense that the 49ers would not be renamed nor moved out of the [[Bay Area]]. This was met with much opposition from Mayor Newsom and [[US Senate|Senator]] [[Dianne Feinstein]] (who was [[mayor of San Francisco]] between 1978 and 1988); the senator stated that the team should be unable to use the San Francisco name if its operations were not based in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sen.

==Santa Clara City Council Negotiations==
The Santa Clara stadium project had been in the works since 2007, with negotiations beginning in 2008. Two years later the following documents were produced that were key to understanding the stadium deal that went before the voters of Santa Clara on June 8, 2010. All documents cited below are publicly available on the City of Santa Clara’s website.

* Term Sheet: Detailed agreement between the city of Santa Clara and the San Francisco 49ers about the financing, construction, operation, and eventual demolition of the stadium. Key points include: no new or increased city taxes or costs to residents; 49ers responsible for construction and operation cost overruns; and the city will continue to own the land and receive rent payments back to its general fund from the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=49ers Santa Clara Stadium Term Sheet|url=http://santaclaraca.gov/ftp/csc/pdf/49ers-20090601-term-sheet.pdf |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100423175055/http://santaclaraca.gov/ftp/csc/pdf/49ers-20090601-term-sheet.pdf |archive-date= 2010-04-23 |publisher=City of Santa Clara|date=June 1, 2009|accessdate=April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Study: Economic and Fiscal Impacts of a New State-of-the-Art Stadium in Santa Clara: This is a study conducted by Conventions Sports and Leisure (CSL). It highlights estimates of a new stadium’s economic and fiscal impact on the City of Santa Clara and the region including the creation of new jobs and new economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic and Fiscal Impacts of a New State-of-the-Art Stadium in Santa Clara|url=http://santaclaraca.gov/ftp/csc/pdf/49ers-EFIR.pdf|publisher=City of Santa Clara|accessdate=April 20, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527140519/http://santaclaraca.gov/ftp/csc/pdf/49ers-EFIR.pdf|archivedate=May 27, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Environmental Impact Report: This document is part of the state-mandated California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process.

Most city council members in Santa Clara were extremely receptive to the possibility of a new stadium being constructed there for the 49ers. In 2009, the Santa Clara City Council, led by Mayor Patricia Mahan, along with city employees began negotiating in earnest with the team, who presented the city with stadium plans. On June 2, 2009, by a 5-2 vote, the Santa Clara city council agreed to preliminary terms (as detailed in a term sheet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://49ers.savesantaclara.org/pdf/49ers-20090601-term-sheet.pdf|title=49ers term sheet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The official term sheet stated that the team's name would not change; the team would continue to be called the San Francisco 49ers even when the move to Santa Clara was complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Niners Show Santa Clara Officials Plans for New $937 Million Stadium|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d8114e703&amp;template=without-video-with-comments&amp;confirm=true|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=July 15, 2009|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supportourniners.com/stadium_design.php |title=000webhost.com - free web hosting provider |publisher=Supportourniners.com |accessdate=February 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227085604/http://www.supportourniners.com/stadium_design.php |archivedate=February 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The campaign==
===Santa Clara stadium campaign===
In December 2009, [[Cedar Fair|Cedar Fair Entertainment]], Great America's owner, filed a lawsuit to stop the project from proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawsuit Could Stall 49ers' Santa Clara Stadium |first=John |last=Coté |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-12-09/news/17182707_1_santa-clara-city-council-theme-park-amusement-park |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=December 9, 2009 |accessdate=February 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927023648/http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-12-09/news/17182707_1_santa-clara-city-council-theme-park-amusement-park |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lawsuit was dismissed in court.

On December 15, 2009, the Santa Clara City Council voted 5-2 to withdraw their city-sponsored ballot measure on the stadium issue in favor of a ballot initiative, Measure J.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Santa Clara Backs 49ers-Sponsored Stadium Ballot Initiative|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/article/135655|work=SportsBusiness Daily|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ballot initiative was voted on on June 8, 2010 and passed by 58% of Santa Clara voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Measure J: Lease of City Land - Santa Clara County, CA|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/2010/06/08/ca/scl/meas/J/|publisher=Smartvoter.org|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Santa Clara: 49er Stadium Proposal Named Measure J|first=Howard|last=Mintz|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_14710946|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=March 19, 2010|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santa Clara City Council members William Kennedy and Jamie McLeod had opposed the stadium project and worked (unsuccessfully) to get Measure J defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=49ers Stadium Campaign is David vs. Goliath Affair|first=Howard|last=Mintz|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_14798691|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=April 1, 2010|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measure J: June 8, 2010===
Measure J is a binding, voter-initiated measure that was approved by voters in the City of Santa Clara. All documents cited below are publicly available on the City of Santa Clara’s official website.

==Oakland Raiders as possible co-tenants==
There was a possibility that the [[Oakland Raiders]] might share the stadium, allowing its costs to be split between the two teams.&lt;ref name="Raiders"&gt;{{cite news |title=NFL May Bribe Raiders, 49ers Into Shotgun Wedding|first=Joe|last=Kukura|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/sports/NFL-May-Bribe-Raiders-49ers-Into-Shotgun-Wedding-96172874.html|work=[[KNTV]]|location=San Francisco|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stadium is designed to accommodate two teams, with the exterior LEDs being programmable for alternate colors and two home-team locker rooms.&lt;ref name='KTVU'&gt;{{cite news |title=Renewed talks of Raiders-49ers sharing Levi's Stadium |first= |last= |url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/74313994-story |work=[[KTVU]] |location= |date=January 13, 2016 |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 49ers&lt;ref name="Raiders" /&gt; and Raiders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Davis Doesn't Deny That Raiders Could Share Stadium With 49ers|first=Sajid|last=Farooq|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Al-Davis-Doesnt-Deny-That-Raiders-Could-Share-Stadium-With-49ers-114173599.html|work=[[KNTV]]|location=San Francisco|date=January 18, 2011|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; publicly said it would be an option if possible, while NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] was strongly in favor of the two sharing a stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Roger Goodell Talks of Stadium Issues|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5672050|work=[[ESPN]]|date=October 10, 2010|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans of both teams reacted negatively to the idea. Along with the [[New York metropolitan area]], where the [[New York Giants]] and [[New York Jets]] shared [[Giants Stadium]] from 1984 to 2009 and currently share its successor, [[MetLife Stadium]], the DC-Baltimore metro area and Los Angeles. The Bay Area is one of 4 NFL markets with two teams.

The 49ers and Raiders sharing a stadium would not have been a first, as the two shared [[Kezar Stadium]] for part of 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1960 Oakland Raiders Statistics &amp; Players |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rai/1960.htm|publisher=Pro-Football-Reference|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have also fulfilled the late Raiders owner [[Al Davis]]' goal of a new stadium, something he had strongly desired since the late 1980s although Davis was against sharing a new stadium with another NFL team in Los Angeles when the idea was proposed to him, prompting his move back to Oakland in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PRO FOOTBALL; Raiders Run a Reverse Play Back to Oakland|first=Timothy W.|last=Smith|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/24/sports/pro-football-raiders-run-a-reverse-play-back-to-oakland.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 24, 1995|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/los-angeles/nfl/post/_/id/97/al-davis-is-back-where-he-started|title=The day Al Davis walked away|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Raiders, as it stands, play at the [[Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum]] and are the only NFL team still sharing its home field with a [[Major League Baseball]] team; the Raiders' lease on the Coliseum has been on year-to-year extensions since the expiration of the last long-term lease in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vikings in Limbo and Expansion Not on NFL's Radar|first1=Dave|last1=Campbell|first2=John|last2=Krawczynski|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/vikings-limbo-expansion-not-nfls-173245299--nfl.html|work=[[Yahoo! Sports]]|date=May 7, 2012|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of Davis' death, the possibility of the 49ers and Raiders sharing the stadium became a stronger possibility. However, by October 2011, the 49ers were far enough along on the stadium to have reportedly already sold over a quarter of the [[Luxury box|luxury suites]], meaning the Raiders would be forced to be secondary tenants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Raiders' Relocation Scenarios Take on New Dynamic|first=Michael|last=Silver|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=ms-silver_al_davis_raiders_relocation_la_stadium101011|work=[[Yahoo!

According to the report, discussions remained open, although Davis wanted to keep the team in Oakland, or a nearby site in [[Dublin, California|Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oakland Raiders Have No Plans to Share Stadium with 49ers|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000081194/article/oakland-raiders-have-no-plans-to-share-stadium-with-49ers?module=HP11_headline_stack|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=October 16, 2012|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the stadium had its grand opening on July 17, 2014, Goodell mentioned to the live crowd that it would make a great home for the Raiders and that it was up for the team to decide whether or not it wanted to play there or build a stadium on the site of the Oakland Coliseum. While the 49ers remained open to sharing the stadium with the Raiders, the Raiders said that their personal preference was the Coliseum site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11229559/roger-goodell-floats-san-francisco-49ers-levi-stadium-oakland-raiders-option Goodell: Levi's might fit Raiders] [[ESPN.com]] (07/18/2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2015, the Raiders announced that they would be seeking a [[Carson Stadium|joint stadium]] in [[Carson, California|Carson]], with the [[San Diego Chargers]] should they not receive public funding to replace the Oakland Coliseum, reducing the likelihood of the Raiders sharing Levi's Stadium with the 49ers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-nfl-stadium-20150220-story.html#page=1|title=Chargers, Raiders will jointly pursue an NFL stadium in Carson|first=Sam|last=Farmer|date=February 20, 2015|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2016, after losing their bid to relocate to Los Angeles to the [[Los Angeles Rams]], the Raiders withdrew their request to move to Los Angeles, and joint tenancy at Levi's again surfaced in general discussion.&lt;ref name='KTVU' /&gt; However, with the [[Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas|Raiders getting approved for a move to Las Vegas]] and securing a local agreement for stadium funding there with [[Las Vegas Stadium]] under construction, it seems unlikely the Raiders will ever pursue a move to Santa Clara.

==Financing and construction==
In December 2011, the Santa Clara City Council voted for an agreement that calls for the city’s Stadium Authority to borrow $850 million from [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Bank of America]] and [[U.S. Bank]]. This will cover most of the construction costs, with the remainder to be made up via funding from the NFL, a hotel tax and city redevelopment funds. Interest, fees  and terms for this loan have not been disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=49ers, Santa Clara Secure Funding for New Stadium|url=http://omaha.stats.com/fb/story.asp?i=20111203134552085620508&amp;ref=hea&amp;tm=&amp;src=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426021044/http://omaha.stats.com/fb/story.asp?i=20111203134552085620508&amp;ref=hea&amp;tm=&amp;src=|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 26, 2012|newspaper=[[Omaha World-Herald]]|date=December 3, 2011|accessdate=December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Santa Clara Stadium Update|first=Scott|last=Kegley|url=http://blog.49ers.com/2011/12/03/new-santa-clara-stadium-update/|publisher=San Francisco 49ers|date=December 3, 2011|accessdate=December 3, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206052607/http://blog.49ers.com/2011/12/03/new-santa-clara-stadium-update/|archivedate=December 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The $850 million building loan, plus interest and fees will be assumed by the City's Stadium Authority, where additional interest and fees will be applied.
On February 2, 2012, NFL owners approved a loan to the 49ers of $200 million for use in constructing the new stadium, and to be taken from a new G-4 stadium loan fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NFL Owners Approve $200 Million Loan for 49ers Stadium|first=Howard|last=Mintz|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_19878108|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=February 3, 2012|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terms of the loan were not specified, but under the previous G-3 plan, money was repaid directly into the league's account from the borrowing team's share of gate receipts from road games.

==Construction==
[[File:49ers New Stadium 2 2013-07-11.jpg|thumb|Levi's Stadium under construction, July 11, 2013]]
Construction began soon after funding for the stadium had been confirmed. The official groundbreaking took place on April 19, 2012.&lt;ref name="mercurynews.com"/&gt; On July 30, 2012, the first steel beams for the stadium were laid down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=San Francisco 49ers Stadium Beams Rise from the Dirt in Santa Clara|first=Mike|last=Rosenburg|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_21193791/san-francisco-49ers-stadium-beams-rise-from-dirt|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=April 19, 2012|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first seats in Levi's Stadium were installed on October 1, 2013.

Construction was halted on June 11, 2013, after a mechanic working on an elevator was struck by a counterweight and then fell down the shaft to his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Work Halted at New Levi's Stadium After Elevator Mechanic Killed|first1=Robert|last1=Salonga|first2=Mike|last2=Gomez|first3=Mike|last3=Rosenburg|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_23434632/santa-clara-person-dies-at-site-new-49ers|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=June 11, 2013|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work resumed two days later after officials from the [[California Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (Cal/OSHA) declared the site safe, but as of October 2013, the accident remained under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Construction Workers Return to Levi's Stadium|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Stadium-Workers-Return-to-New-49ers-Stadium-211378871.html|work=[[KNTV]]|location=San Francisco|date=June 13, 2013|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cal OSHA Reopens Investigation Into Elevator Worker’s Death At Levi’s Stadium|url=http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2013/10/23/cal-osha-reopens-investigation-into-elevator-workers-death-at-new-49ers-stadium/|work=[[KOVR]]|location=Sacramento|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=October 23, 2013|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Santa Clara stadium was constructed on a city-owned parking lot on Tasman Drive, located adjacent to the north of [[California's Great America]] theme park and leased to Great America for overflow parking. As with Candlestick Park, there are relatively few amenities in the stadium's immediate vicinity for sports fans, besides the 49ers headquarters and training facility. The [[Santa Clara Convention Center]] is northwest of the stadium site and there are two hotels on Tasman Drive next to the convention center, but the closest significant concentration of hotels and restaurants is on the Mission College Boulevard corridor almost a mile to the south, on the other side of Great America.

==Opening==
[[File:Entering Levi's Stadium.JPG|thumb|Levi's Stadium on August 2, 2014, hosting its first-ever game, a soccer match featuring the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] and [[Seattle Sounders FC]].]]
The stadium opened on July 17, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/southbayfootball/ci_26168577/49ers-open-levis-stadium-show-stopping-nfl-ceremony|title=49ers open Levi's Stadium with showstopping NFL ceremony|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=July 17, 2014|first=Mike|last= Rosenberg|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally scheduled to open on July 11, but was pushed back due to construction delays.
The first game played at the new stadium was a [[Major League Soccer]] match on August 2, 2014, where the [[2014 San Jose Earthquakes season|San Jose Earthquakes]] defeated [[2014 Seattle Sounders FC season|Seattle Sounders FC]] 1–0 before a crowd of 48,765. The inaugural goal was scored in the 42nd minute by [[Yannick Djaló]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soccerbyives.net/2014/08/earthquakes-sounders-stadium.html "EARTHQUAKES UPSET SOUNDERS TO OPEN LEVI’S STADIUM"], Soccer By Ives, August 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, 2014, the [[2014 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] lost their first preseason game, 34–0, against the [[2014 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] at Levi's Stadium. One fan at the game collapsed due to the heat and had to be rushed to a local hospital, where he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11369709/man-collapsed-san-francisco-49ers-preseason-game-levi-stadium-dies |title=Man who collapsed during San Francisco 49ers preseason game at Levi's Stadium dies |author=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=18 August 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 49ers' regular-season game at the stadium was held during Week 2 on September 14, 2014, when the team hosted the [[2014 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] on ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ninersnation.com/2014/4/23/5643678/49ers-2014-schedule-dates-games-home-away |title=San Francisco 49ers 2014 schedule: Dates, game times, strength of schedule and more |author=David Fucillo |publisher=Niners Nation |date=Apr 23, 2014 |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bears won the game 28–20&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Associated Press]] |url=http://abc7chicago.com/sports/brandon-marshall-makes-2-tds-via-jay-cutler-to-beat-49ers/309104/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140918040122/http://abc7chicago.com/sports/brandon-marshall-makes-2-tds-via-jay-cutler-to-beat-49ers/309104/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 18, 2014 |title=BRANDON MARSHALL MAKES 3 TDS VIA JAY CUTLER TO BEAT 49ERS |publisher=[[WLS-TV]] |date=September 14, 2014 |accessdate=September 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in front of a 49ers home record attendance of 70,799.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/56200/SF_Gamebook.pdf |title=Bears-49ers Gamebook |author=National Football League |publisher=nfl.com |date=2014-09-17 |accessdate=2014-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weekdays and parking==
In November 2013, stadium and 49ers' officials initially requested the [[National Football League|NFL]] to not schedule any [[Monday Night Football|Monday]] or [[Thursday Night Football|Thursday]] night home games during Levi's Stadium's inaugural season due to parking issues in the area surrounding the stadium during weekdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lack Of Parking Means No Monday Night Football At Levi's Stadium|first=Phil|last=Matier|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2013/12/09/phil-matier-lack-of-parking-means-no-monday-night-football-at-levis-stadium/|work=[[KPIX]]|location=San Francisco|date=December 9, 2013|accessdate=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, in January 2014, the Santa Clara city government was able to secure more than the 21,000 necessary parking spots by approving use of the fairways at the city-owned Santa Clara Golf and Tennis Club (which is located to the north of the stadium across Tasman Drive). This arrangement is similar to and was modeled upon a longstanding arrangement between the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California]] and the adjacent [[Brookside Golf Course]], where the golf course was modified to allow for vehicular access to the fairways; they are used for parking only when dry to minimize damage, and any damage that does occur is repaired afterward.

With access to the golf course fairways, Levi's Stadium now had 31,600 potential parking spaces, meaning that tailgating and weeknight games were now a possibility. However, the NFL decided not to schedule any weeknight home games at Levi's Stadium in 2014 until traffic flow within the area is figured out, with the exception of a [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving]] game between the 49ers and the [[2014 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] on November 27, 2014. Parking prices, which averaged $30 in the 49ers' final season at Candlestick Park, will increase to $40 at Levi's Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=49ers Surpass Goal for Parking Spots at New Levi's Stadium|first=Matt|last=Keller|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/sports/pro/football&amp;id=9394650|work=[[KGO-TV|KGO]]|location=San Francisco|date=January 15, 2014|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anticipating significant traffic from Levi's Stadium visitors, the nearby city of [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]] instituted a three-hour parking limit on downtown streets during game days. While residents received exemptions via permit tags, stadium-goers must park in paid lots or far from Mountain View's Caltrain/VTA light rail station. This station is the closest VTA light rail station to San Francisco and receives transferring passengers heading south to San Jose via light rail (including people using the light rail to go directly to the Levi's Stadium station).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_26074010/mountain-view-council-approves-pilot-parking-program-address|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|accessdate=August 15, 2014 |date=July 2, 2014| title=Mountain View: Council approves pilot parking program to address impacts from Levi's Stadium |last=Green |first=Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spring 2015, 49ers' officials offered the city of Santa Clara $15 million to take over the adjacent Santa Clara Youth Soccer Park and convert these soccer fields into additional parking lots. This money, along with a large percentage of parking fees, would have then been used for the city to build a new youth sports complex elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_27953862/santa-clara-critics-pan-49ers-15-million-offer?source=infinite|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|accessdate=June 6, 2015 |date=April 20, 2015| title=Santa Clara: Critics pan 49ers' $15 million offer to take over youth soccer fields |last=Rodriguez |first=Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was opposed by the youth soccer leagues that use the fields, and critics calling it a "land grab".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Dispute-Between-49ers-Santa-Clara-Youth-Soccer-Leagues-Over-Fields-Near-Levis-Stadium-300733471.html|work=[[KNTV-TV]]/NBC Bay Area|accessdate=June 6, 2015 |date=April 20, 2015| title=Dispute Between 49ers, Santa Clara Youth Soccer Leagues Over Fields Near Levi's Stadium}}&lt;/ref&gt; After many youth soccer players attended a city council meeting on April 29 to protest the proposal, the 49ers withdrew the $15 million offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/04/29/49ers-pull-15m-offer-for-fields-after-youth-soccer-players-take-stand/|work=[[KPIX-TV]]/CBS San Francisco|accessdate=June 6, 2015 |date=April 29, 2015| title=49ers Pull $15M Offer For Fields After Youth Soccer Players Take Stand}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team then gave the city an unsolicited offer of $3 million to help improve various youth athletic fields and facilities, which was cited as a peace offering by ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' columnists Phil Matier and Andrew Ross, and other Bay Area media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Niners-can-t-give-it-away-Santa-Clara-nixes-6263392.php|work=SFgate.com|accessdate=June 6, 2015 |date=May 14, 2015| title=Santa Clara City Council rejects 49ers’ $3 million peace offering | authors=Phil Matier and Andrew Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the city council turned the offer down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/05/14/santa-clara-city-council-rejects-49ers-3-million-donation-to-help-youth-sports/|work=[[KCBS-AM]]/CBS San Francisco|accessdate=June 6, 2015 |date=May 14, 2015| title=Santa Clara City Council Rejects 49ers $3 Million Donation To Help Youth Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''luminescent solar concentrator''' ('''LSC''') is a device for concentrating [[radiation]], [[Non-ionizing radiation|solar radiation]] in particular, to produce electricity. Luminescent solar concentrators operate on the principle of collecting radiation over a large area, converting it by [[luminescence]] (specifically by [[fluorescence]]) and directing the generated radiation into a relatively small output target.

== Design ==

Initial designs typically comprised parallel thin, flat layers of alternating luminescent and transparent materials, placed to gather incoming radiation on their (broader) faces and emit concentrated radiation around their (narrower) edges.&lt;ref name=RRSN&gt;{{cite journal |title= Planar solar energy converter and concentrator based on uranyl-doped glass |last1=Reisfeld |first1= Renata |author1-link= Renata Reisfeld |first2= Samuel |last2=Neuman |journal= Nature |date= July 13, 1978 |volume= 274 |pages= 144–145 |doi= 10.1038/274144a0|bibcode= 1978Natur.274..144R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reisfeld|first1=Renata|last2=Kalisky|first2=Yehoshua|title=Improved planar solar converter based on uranyl neodymium and holmium glasses|journal=Nature|volume=283|issue=5744|year=1980|pages=281–282|doi=10.1038/283281a0|bibcode=1980Natur.283..281R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly the device would direct the concentrated radiation onto [[solar cell]]s to generate electric power.

Other configurations (such as [[Dopant|doped]] or coated [[optical fiber]]s, or contoured stacks of alternating layers) may better fit particular applications.

== Structure and principles of operation ==

The layers in the stack may be separate parallel plates or alternating strata in a solid structure. In principle, if the effective input area is sufficiently large relative to the effective output area, the output would be of correspondingly higher [[irradiance]] than the input, as measured in [[watt]]s per square metre. The concentration factor is the ratio between output and input irradiance of the whole device.

For example, imagine a square glass sheet (or stack) 200&amp;nbsp;mm on a side, 5&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Its input area (e.g. the surface of one single face of the sheet oriented toward the energy source) is 10 times greater than the output area (e.g. the surface of four open sides) - 40000 square mm (200x200) as compared to 4000 square mm (200x5x4). To a first approximation, the concentration factor of such an LSC is proportional to the area of the input surfaces divided by the area of the edges multiplied by the efficiency of diversion of incoming light towards the output area. Suppose that the glass sheet could divert incoming light from the face towards the edges with an efficiency of 50%. The hypothetical sheet of glass in our example would give an output irradiance of light 5 times greater than that of the incident light, producing a concentration factor of 5.

Similarly, a graded refractive index optic fibre 1 square mm in cross section, and 1 metre long, with a luminescent coating might prove useful.

=== Concentration factor versus efficiency ===

The concentration factor interacts with the efficiency of the device to determine overall output.

* The concentration factor is the ratio between the incoming and emitted irradiance. If the input irradiance is 1&amp;nbsp;kW/m2 and the output irradiance is 10&amp;nbsp;kW/m2, that would provide a concentration factor of 10.
* The efficiency is the ratio between the incoming [[radiant flux]] (measured in watts) and the outgoing wattage, or the fraction of the incoming energy that the device can deliver as usable output energy (not the same as light or electricity, some of which might not be usable). In the previous example, half the received wattage is re-emitted, implying efficiency of 50%.

Most devices (such as solar cells) for converting the incoming energy to useful output  are relatively small and costly, and they work best at converting directional light at high intensities and a narrow frequency range, whereas input radiation tends to be at diffuse frequencies, of relatively low irradiance and [[Colorfulness|saturation]]. Concentration of the input energy accordingly is one option for efficiency and economy.

=== Luminescence ===

The above description covers a wider class of concentrators (for example simple optical concentrators) than just luminescent solar concentrators. The essential attribute of LSCs is that they incorporate luminescent materials that absorb incoming light with a wide frequency range, and re-emit the energy in the form of light in a narrow frequency range. The narrower the frequency range, (i.e. the higher the saturation) the simpler a [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] [[photovoltaic cell|cell]] can be designed to convert it to electricity.

Suitable optical designs trap light emitted by the luminescent material in all directions, redirecting it so that little escapes the [[Solar cell|photovoltaic converters]]. Redirection techniques include [[internal reflection]], [[refractive index]] gradients and where suitable, [[diffraction]]. In principle such LSCs can use light from cloudy skies and similar diffuse sources that are of little use for powering conventional solar cells or for concentration by conventional optical reflectors or refractive devices.

The luminescent component might be a [[dopant]] in the material of some or all of the transparent medium, or it might be in the form of luminescent [[thin films]] on the surfaces of some of the transparent components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reisfeld |first1= Renata |author1-link= Renata Reisfeld |title= New developments in luminescence for solar energy utilization |journal= Optical Materials |date= July 2010 |volume=32 |issue=9 |pages= 850–856 |doi= 10.1016/j.optmat.2010.04.034 |bibcode=2010OptMa..32..850R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory of luminescent solar concentrators ==

Various articles have discussed the theory of internal reflection of fluorescent light so as to provide concentrated emission at the edges, both for doped glasses &lt;ref name=RRSN/&gt;  and for organic dyes incorporated into bulk polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00883080| title = Solar energy conversion with fluorescent collectors| journal = Applied Physics| volume = 14| issue = 2| pages = 123| year = 1977| last1 = Goetzberger | first1 = A.| last2 = Greube | first2 = W.| bibcode = 1977ApPhy..14..123G}}&lt;/ref&gt; When transparent plates are doped with fluorescent materials, effective design requires that the dopants should absorb most of the solar spectrum, re-emitting most of the absorbed energy as long-wave luminescence. In turn, the fluorescent components should be transparent to the emitted wavelengths. Meeting those conditions allows the transparent matrix to convey the radiation to the output area. Control of the internal path of the luminescence could rely on repeated internal reflection of the fluorescent light, and refraction in a medium with a graded refractive index.

Theoretically about 75-80 % of the luminescence could be trapped by total internal reflection in a plate with a refractive index roughly equal to that of typical window glass. Somewhat better efficiency could be achieved by using materials with higher refractive indices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reisfeld |first1= Renata |author1-link= Renata Reisfeld |first2= Dimitri |last2=Shamrakov |first3= Christian |last3=Jorgensen |title= Photostable solar concentrators based on fluorescent glass films |journal= Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells |date= August 1994 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages= 417–427 |doi= 10.1016/0927-0248(94)90002-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an arrangement using a device with a high concentration factor should offer impressive economies in the investment in photovoltaic cells to produce a given amount of electricity. Under ideal conditions the calculated overall efficiency of such a system, in the sense of the amount of energy leaving the photovoltaic cell divided by the energy falling on the plate, should be about 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reisfeld |first1= Renata |author1-link= Renata Reisfeld |first2= Christian K. |last2=Jørgensen |title= Luminescent solar concentrators for energy conversion |journal= Structure and Bonding |date= 1982 |volume= 49 |pages= 1–36 |doi= 10.1007/BFb0111291 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This takes into account:

* the absorption of light by poorly transparent materials in the transparent medium,
* the efficiency of light conversion by the luminescent components,
* the escape of luminescence beyond the critical angle and
* gross efficiency (which is the ratio of the average energy emitted to the average energy absorbed).

== Practical prospects and challenges ==

The relative merits of various functional components and configurations are major concerns, in particular:

* Organic dyes offer wider ranges of frequencies and more flexibility in choice of frequencies emitted and re-absorbed than rare earth compounds and other inorganic luminescent agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reisfeld |first1= Renata |author1-link= Renata Reisfeld |doi=10.1002/bbpc.19780820820 |first2=Christian H. |last2=Jørgensen |title=Lasers and Excited States of Rare Earths |work=Inorganic Chemistry Concepts |publisher=Springer-Verlag, |location =Berlin, Heidelberg, New York |date=1977 |issn=0172-7966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Michael |last1=Gaft |last2=Reisfeld |first2= Renata |author1-link= Renata Reisfeld |first3=Gerard |last3=Panczer|title=Modern Luminescence Spectroscopy of Minerals and Materials|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=QBoTvW_h1FQC |p=3}}|date=20 April 2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-21918-7 |p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Doping organic polymers is generally practical with organic luminescent agents, whereas doping with stable inorganic luminescent agents usually is not practical except in inorganic glasses.
* Luminescent agents configured as bulk doping of a transparent medium have merits that differ from those of thin films deposited on a clear medium.
* Various trapping media present varying combinations of durability, transparency, compatibility with other materials and refractive index. Inorganic glass and organic polymer media comprise the two main classes of interest.
* Photonic systems create [[band gap]]s that trap radiation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jap.aip.org/resource/1/japiau/v105/i1/p014909_s1 M. Peters, J. C. Goldschmidt, P. Löper, B. Bläsi, and A. Gombert; The effect of photonic structures on the light guiding efficiency of fluorescent concentrators; Journal of Applied Physics 105, 014909 (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identifying materials that re-emit more input light as useful luminescence with negligible self-absorption is crucial. Attainment of that ideal depends on tuning the relevant electronic excitation energy levels to differ from the emission levels in the luminescent medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cplett.2010.03.087| title = Non-self-absorbing materials for Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSC)| journal = Chemical Physics Letters| volume = 492| pages = 60| year = 2010| last1 = Saraidarov | first1 = T.| last2 = Levchenko | first2 = V.| last3 = Grabowska | first3 = A.| last4 = Borowicz | first4 = P.| last5 = Reisfeld | first5 = R.| bibcode = 2010CPL...492...60S}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alternatively the luminescent materials can be configured into thin films that emit light into transparent passive media that can efficiently conduct towards the output.
* The sensitivity of solar cells must match the maximal emission spectrum of the luminescent colorants.
* Increase the probability of transition from the ground state to the excited state of surface [[plasmon]]s increases efficiency.

Luminescent solar concentrators could be used to integrate solar-harvesting devices into building façades in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Francesco |last1=Meinardi |first2=Francesco |last2=Bruni |first3=Sergio |last3=Brovelli |date=21 November 2017 |title=Luminescent solar concentrators for building-integrated photovoltaics |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/natrevmats201772 |journal=Nature Reviews Materials |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1038/natrevmats.2017.72 |access-date=23 May 2018 |bibcode=2017NatRM...217072M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advances==

===Transparent Luminescent Solar Concentrators===

In 2013, researchers at Michigan State University demonstrated the first visibly transparent luminescent solar concentrators.&lt;ref name="ZhaoLunt2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhao|first1=Yimu|last2=Lunt|first2=Richard R.|title=Transparent Luminescent Solar Concentrators for Large-Area Solar Windows Enabled by Massive Stokes-Shift Nanocluster Phosphors|journal=Advanced Energy Materials|volume=3|year=2013|pages=1143–1148|doi=10.1002/aenm.201300173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These devices were composed of phosphorescent metal halide nanocluster (or [[Quantum Dot]]) blends that exhibit massive Stokes shift (or downconversion) and which selectively absorb ultraviolet and emit near-infrared light, allowing for selective harvesting, improved reabsorption efficiency, and non-tinted transparency in the visible spectrum.
The following year, these researchers demonstrated near-infrared harvesting visibly transparent luminescent solar concentrators by utilizing luminescent organic salt derivatives.&lt;ref name="ZhaoLunt2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhao|first1=Yimu|last2=Meek|first2=Garrett A.|last3=Levine|first3=Benjamin G.|last4=Lunt|first4=Richard R.|title=Near-Infrared Harvesting Transparent Luminescent Solar Concentrators|journal=Advanced Optical Materials|volume=2|year=2014|pages=606–611|doi=10.1002/adom.201400103}}&lt;/ref&gt; These devices exhibit a clear visible transparency similar to that of glass and a power conversion efficiency close to 0.5%. In this configuration efficiencies of over 10% are possible due to the large fraction of photon flux in the near-infrared spectrum.&lt;ref name="ZhaoLunt2014"/&gt;

=== Quantum dots ===

In 2014 LSCs based on cadmium selenide/cadmium sulfide (CdSe/CdS) [[quantum dot]]s (QD) with induced large separation between emission and absorption bands (called a large [[Stokes shift]]) were announced.&lt;ref name=rd1405&gt;{{cite news|author=Nancy Ambrosiano |url=http://www.rdmag.com/news/2014/04/shiny-quantum-dots-brighten-future-solar-cells |title=Shiny quantum dots brighten future of solar cells |work=R&amp;D |date=2014-04-14 |accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MeinardiColombo2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meinardi|first1=Francesco|last2=Colombo|first2=Annalisa|last3=Velizhanin|first3=Kirill A.|last4=Simonutti|first4=Roberto|last5=Lorenzon|first5=Monica|last6=Beverina|first6=Luca|last7=Viswanatha|first7=Ranjani|last8=Klimov|first8=Victor I.|last9=Brovelli|first9=Sergio|title=Large-area luminescent solar concentrators based on ‘Stokes-shift-engineered’ nanocrystals in a mass-polymerized PMMA matrix|journal=Nature Photonics|volume=8|issue=5|year=2014|pages=392–399|doi=10.1038/nphoton.2014.54|bibcode=2014NaPho...8..392M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Light absorption is dominated by an ultra-thick outer shell of CdS, while emission occurs from the inner core of a narrower-gap CdSe. The separation of light-absorption and light-emission functions between the two parts of the nanostructure results in a large spectral shift of emission with respect to absorption, which greatly reduces re-absorption losses. The QDs were incorporated into large slabs (sized in tens of centimeters) of [[polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA). The active particles were about one hundred angstroms across.&lt;ref name=rd1405/&gt;

Spectroscopic measurements indicated virtually no re-absorption losses on distances of tens of centimeters. Photon harvesting efficiencies were approximately 10%. Despite their high transparency, the fabricated structures showed significant enhancement of solar flux with the concentration factor of more than four.&lt;ref name=rd1405/&gt;

[[File:Fig9Corset en fer (Musee de Cluny).gif|thumb|Iron corset in the [[Musee de Cluny]]. Drawing made in 1893 by Saint-Elme Gautier.]]

'''Metal corsets''' (also known as '''iron corsets''') are a type of [[History of corsets|historical]] [[corset]] or [[bodice]] made entirely out of metal, usually [[iron]] or steel. The metal corset was popularly claimed to have been introduced to France by [[Catherine de' Medici]] in the 16th century, although this is now considered a myth. The idea that such garments were worn for fashionable purposes is debatable, with fashion historians now regarding such claims sceptically. Many of the original metal bodices that have survived are now believed to have been intended for medical purposes as [[Orthotics|orthopaedic]] support garments and back braces. Such garments were described by the French army surgeon [[Ambroise Paré]] in the sixteenth century as a remedy for the "crookednesse of the Bodie."

Some of the more extreme examples of metal corsets that have survived are now generally thought to be later reproductions designed to appeal to [[Sexual fetishism|fetishists]], rather than garments intended for fashionable wear.

Metal medical corsets were still being made in the twentieth century, whilst, since the late 20th century, fashion designers such as [[Alexander McQueen]] and [[Issey Miyake]] have made contemporary metal bodices and corsets from wire and [[aluminium]] coils.

==Origins==
[[File:Catherinedemedicishadow.jpg|thumb|upright|Catherine de' Medici, c. 1555]]
Early fashion historians and writers have often attributed the introduction of fashionable corset-wearing to [[Catherine de' Medici]], who is said to have brought metal corsets to France from Italy in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=norris&gt;{{cite book |last1=Norris |first1=Herbert |title=Tudor costume and fashion|date=1938|publisher=Dover Publications |location=Mineola, N.Y. |isbn=978-0-486-29845-0 |pages=222–223 |edition=1997 reprint |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yVdfZGj6NmkC&amp;pg=PA222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=steele&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steele |first1=Valerie |title=The Corset : a cultural history |date=2003 |publisher=Yale University |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-09953-9 |page=5 |edition=2nd print. |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uk6I0-MDXVQC&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion historian [[Valerie Steele]] noted that after 19th-century writers catering to audiences for [[tightlacing]] and [[sexual fetishism]] played up the [[BDSM|sadomasochistic]] idea of a "cruel, tortuous fashion" enforced by a dominant queen who demanded unrealistically small waists from her subjects, this mythical royal connection captured public imagination and became part of fashion mythology.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt;

It is now widely believed that authentic metal corsets were intended as a form of [[orthotics|orthopaedic brace]] to address spinal issues such as [[scoliosis]].&lt;ref name=steele/&gt;&lt;ref name=fit/&gt;&lt;ref name=ewing&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ewing |first1=Elizabeth |title=Fashion in underwear : from Babylon to bikini briefs |date=2010 |publisher=Dover Publications |location=Mineola, N.Y. |isbn=978-0-486-47649-0 |page=28 |edition=Dover |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pX5r8p1dPjUC&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 16th-century French army surgeon [[Ambroise Paré]] described metal corsets as intended "to amend the crookednesse of the Bodie," recommending that the iron should be perforated in order to make the garments lighter, and that they be made to fit and padded for comfort.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt; Paré criticised the concept of corsetry as a waist-training device, warning that such a practice risked deforming the figure.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt;

A steel corset in the [[Stibbert Museum]], Florence, Italy, is dated to the mid-16th century, and thought to be similar to the metal stays recorded as having been made by a ''corazzaio mastro'' (master armour-maker) for [[Eleanor of Toledo]] and delivered to her on 28 February 1549.&lt;ref name=moda&gt;{{cite book |last1=Landini |first1=Roberta Orsi |last2=Niccoli |first2=Bruna |title=Moda a Firenze 1540–1580 : lo stile di Eleonora di Toledo e la sua influenza |date=2005 |publisher=Pagliai Polistampa |page=132 |location=Firenze |isbn=978-88-8304-867-8 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VZ_pAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=corazzaio |language=Italian |quote=Tuttavia Eleonora possiede anche due busti di acciaio (62), consegnati il 28 febbraio 1549 dal corazzaio mastro}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Eleanor's wardrobe records do not list any boned or stiffened corsets, it is thought that her steel bodice was designed for medical or therapeutic reasons rather than worn as a fashionable garment.&lt;ref name=moda/&gt;

Although surviving metal bodices are usually dated to the late 16th and early 17th century, Steele has stated that some of the more extreme and elaborate examples are fakes created from the 19th century onwards to cater to fetishistic "fantasies about women imprisoned in metal corsets."&lt;ref name=steele/&gt; For example, Herbert Norris claimed in ''Tudor Costume and Fashion'' (1938) that a misbehaving wife would be locked into a metal corset by her husband until she promised to behave.&lt;ref name=norris/&gt; One such iron corset, with a 14-inch waist, was acquired by the [[Fashion Institute of Technology|FIT]] Museum as dating from 1580–1600, but is now considered to be a forgery from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=fit&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff writer |title=Iron corset 1875–1925 |url=https://museum-at-fit.culturalspot.org/asset-viewer/iron-corset/fgHPM7b4_RZXRQ?hl=en |publisher=The Museum at FIT |accessdate=29 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929173328/https://museum-at-fit.culturalspot.org/asset-viewer/iron-corset/fgHPM7b4_RZXRQ?hl=en |archivedate=29 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steele noted suspicious similarities between this corset and an illustration first published in 1868 in ''The Corset and the Crinoline'', a "fetishistic" book claiming to offer a historical overview of fashion, and draws parallels between such corsets and fake medieval [[chastity belt]]s.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt; [[Harold Koda]], the former curator of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s [[Costume Institute]], states that the excessive, mechanically produced regularity of the garment's structure is evidence for its being a 19th-century fabrication.&lt;ref name=koda&gt;{{cite book |last1=Koda |first1=Harold |title=Extreme beauty : the body transformed |date=2003 |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |location=New York |isbn=978-0-300-10312-0 |pages=75–76 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rL-19_S0-PMC&amp;pg=PA75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koda's take on the significant percentage of extant nineteenth-century metal corsets made in emulation of purported sixteenth-century models is that they were created to cater to a specialist market, perhaps for inclusion in [[Cabinet of curiosities|collector's cabinets]].&lt;ref name=koda/&gt;

The fashion historians C. Willett Cunnington and his wife Phillis also stated firmly that surviving "iron bodies," when not medical garments, were usually "fanciful 'reproductions'" with no proof of their having genuinely been worn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cunnington |first1=C. Willett |last2=Cunnington |first2=Phillis |title=The history of underclothes |date=1951 |publisher=Dover Pub.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-486-31978-0|page=48|edition=1992 reprint |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PUXDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the explicit scepticism of fashion historians such as Steele and the Cunningtons, scholars outside the field of dress history sometimes treat these corsets as legitimate fashion garments. The anthropologist Marianne Thesander concluded that because such bodices fit the fashionable silhouette of their alleged period, they were probably authentic, and served the same purpose as other corsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thesander |first1=Marianne |title=The feminine ideal |date=1997 |publisher=Reaktion Books |location=London |isbn=978-1-86189-004-7 |page=62 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mo3shY_azw0C&amp;pg=PA62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th and 19th century==
[[File:Orthopaedic corset, Europe, 1801-1880 Wellcome L0057511.jpg|thumb|upright|Orthopaedic corset for a child. Iron. Europe, 1801–1880.]]
In ''Fashion and Fetishism'', David Kunzle noted that in Peter Rondeau's 1739 French-German dictionary, the French term ''corps de fer'' is explained in German as "Schnürburst, mit kleinen eisernen blechen, für übel gewachsenes Frauenzimmer" (A bodice, with small iron plates, for badly grown (i.e., deformed) girls).&lt;ref name=kunzle108/&gt; He reads this as implying that the iron plates would have been part of a fabric corset, rather than an all-metal garment.&lt;ref name=kunzle108/&gt;

Kunzle has noted the absence of literary evidence for showing that metal corsets were also worn for fashion purposes.&lt;ref name=kunzle76&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kunzle |first1=David |title=Fashion and fetishism : a social history of the corset, tight-lacing and other forms of body-sculpture in the West |date=1982 |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|location=Totowa, N.J.|isbn=978-0-8476-6276-0|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has suggested that surviving metal garments, if not specifically medical in purpose, might have served the same [[sadomasochism|masochistically]] gratifying purpose as the deliberately uncomfortable, tortuous [[cilice|hair shirt]], combining a fashionable silhouette with [[penance]], and as such, might have been worn in [[convent]]s.&lt;ref name=kunzle76/&gt; To support his "pure speculation", Kunzle cites a 1871 newspaper report from ''[[The Times]]'' reporting that during the [[Paris Commune]], the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] found two iron corsets, a [[rack (torture)|rack]], and other instruments in the Convent of the White Nuns in [[Picpus, Paris|Picpus]].&lt;ref name=kunzle108&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kunzle |first1=David |title=Fashion and fetishism : a social history of the corset, tight-lacing and other forms of body-sculpture in the West |date=1982 |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |location=Totowa, N.J.|isbn=978-0-8476-6276-0|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim by the [[Abbess|Mother Superior]] that the instruments were for orthopaedic purposes was dismissed at the time as "a superficial falsehood."&lt;ref name=kunzle108/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Special Correspondent |title=A Popular Fete at the Tulllieres |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3325334/the_times/ |accessdate=30 September 2015|work=The Times |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |date=9 May 1871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal corsets for medical purposes continued to be used in the 18th and early 19th century, although equivalent garments made from canvas were increasingly used in their place.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt; In 1894, A.M. Phelps of the American Orthopaedic Association recommended an aluminium corset coated with waterproof enamel for sufferers of [[Pott disease]] or curvature of the spine.&lt;ref name=phelps&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Phelps |first1=A. M. |title=The Aluminium Corset |journal=Transactions of the American Orthopedic Association |date=16 September 1894 |volume=1 |pages=236–237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Made from a cast of the patient's body, the advantages of such a garment were that aluminium was lightweight, durable, thin enough to be worn beneath clothing, and could be worn while bathing.&lt;ref name=phelps/&gt; Such corsets were still being recommended in the early 20th century as cheaper and more durable in the longer run than plaster moulds, although their initial expense was greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Unknown |title=Untitled section |journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association |date=1902 |page=1439 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mlYKAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22aluminium+corset%22 |publisher=American Medical Association |quote=I always advise the aluminium corset, for, although the first cost is greater than for the plaster-of-paris support, yet, before treatment is ended, the metal appliance will have proved the cheaper.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th and 21st centuries==
[[File:Fitting of the Coiled Corset.jpg|thumb|The Coiled Corset, [[Shaun Leane (jeweller)|Shaun Leane]] for [[Alexander McQueen]], 1999.]]
Since the 20th century, actual metal corsets have occasionally been made for contemporary wear, although such instances are rare.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt; Steele notes that alongside a 1930s metal corset made for and worn by a fetish corsetiere called Cayne, the late 20th- and early 21st-century [[Tightlacing|tight-lacer]] [[Cathie Jung]] had a silver corset-cover made to wear over her actual laced corset.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt; Between 1933 and 1940 Mrs. Cayne advertised a booklet describing her 14-inch waistline and offered other services in the ''[[Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kunzle|first1=David|title=Fashion and fetishism: a social history of the corset, tight-lacing and other forms of body-sculpture in the West |date=1982 |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |location=Totowa, NJ|isbn=978-0-8476-6276-0|page=333}} Plate 8 in the book is a photograph of Mrs. Cayne's corset.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a medical garment, metal corsets endured well into the 20th century. The Mexican painter [[Frida Kahlo]] was a notable wearer of such medical corsets, following ongoing problems as a result of a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Grosenick|editor1-first=Uta |title=Women artists in the 20th and 21st century |date=2001 |publisher=Taschen |location=Köln |isbn=978-3-8228-5854-7 |page=252 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZSvSfCmzo2wC&amp;pg=PA252}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of the plaster ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, ''[[The Broken Column]]''.&lt;ref name=kettenmann&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kettenmann |first1=Andrea |title=Frida Kahlo, 1907–1954 : pain and passion |date=2007 |publisher=Taschen |location=Köln |isbn=978-3-8228-5983-4 |pages=67–68 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=s_ZdPsktyjEC&amp;pg=PA67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, her torso split open revealing that her spine is a crumbling [[Ionic order|Ionic column]], and her damaged body held together by the steel corset.&lt;ref name=kettenmann/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff writer |title=Frida Kahlo: Room Guide: Room 11: Achieving Equilibrium|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/frida-kahlo/frida-kahlo-room-guide/frida-kahlo-room-guide-room-11|website=Tate Modern|publisher=Tate Modern|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A form of metal corset or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macnab|first1=Ian|title=A new spinal brace|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=4 July 1970 |volume=103 |page=53|url=http://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC1930323&amp;blobtype=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris braces are designed to immobilise the waist whilst healing, and are made with two bendable metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farfan|first1=H.F. |last2=Hadjipavlou|first2=Alexander G.|editor1-last=Simmons |editor1-first=James W.|title=The Sciatic syndrome|date=1996|publisher=SLACK|location=Thorofare, N.J. |isbn=9781556422430 |page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

20th and 21st century designers have sometimes offered metal corsets and bodices as part of their presentations, including [[Alexander McQueen]], [[Issey Miyake]], and [[Thierry Mugler]].&lt;ref name=koda/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lauder |first1=Velda |title=Corsets : a modern guide|date=2010|publisher=A. &amp; C.

==In museums==
Metal corsets are found in a number of museum collections around the world. Some museums, including the Museo Stibbert, and the [[Kyoto]] Costume Institute in Japan, present their metal bodices as fashionable late 16th-century garments.&lt;ref name=moda/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fukai |first1=Akiko |title=Fashion : the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute : a history from the 18th to the 20th century |date=2002 |publisher=Taschen |location=Köln |isbn=978-3-8228-1206-8 |pages=13–15 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ARLmnMFZ9rcC&amp;pg=PA13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London describes their iron corset (formerly owned by the painter [[Talbot Hughes]]) as dating from the 18th century and likely intended for orthopaedic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Staff writer |title=Corset, 18th century, iron. |url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O139315/corset-unknown/?print=1 |website=V&amp;A Search the Collections |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as the iron corset in the Fashion Institute of Technology, are presented as fakes.&lt;ref name=fit/&gt;

'''Metals and Engineering Corporation''' abbreviated as '''METEC''', is an Ethiopian military-run corporation,&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-18/ethiopian-military-run-corporation-seeks-more-foreign-partners]&lt;/ref&gt; which is established in 2010. It is the largest [[military-industrial complex]] in Ethiopia and responsible for the production of military equipment and civilian products. METEC works with foreign companies such as [[Alstom]] from France, and Spire Corporation from America.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt;

METEC was once responsible for constructing the $4 billion dam project on the River [[Nile]], expected to be Africa’s biggest hydroelectric project, but was ousted from the contract in August&lt;ref&gt;[https://qz.com/africa/1461676/ethiopias-security-chiefs-arrested-after-attack-on-abiy-ahmed/[&lt;/ref&gt;. Kinfe Dagnew, a Brigadier General in Ethiopia’s army and former chief executive of METEC plays a significant role in the organization. The company was assigned development of Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and sugar factory,&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201612140935.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as well as the [[Jinka]] Sugar Bag factory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2merkato.com/news/alerts/4864-ethiopia-jinka-bag-factory-commenced-test-run]&lt;/ref&gt; On November 12, 2018, all assigned project canceled due to fail to complete, and government arrested Kinfe Dagnew, CEO of METEC, after a trial to escape through [[Sudan]], where he was captured by Defence force. Kinfe Dagnew arrived in helicopter to [[Addis Ababa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebc.et/web/news-en/-/police-arrests-former-metec-director-general-m-general-kinfe-dagnew|title=Police arrests former METEC Director General M/General Kinfe Dagnew - display page - ebc|website=www.ebc.et|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption publicity==
In April 2018, Kinfe Dagnew resigned the company after serving entire eight years, when Prime Minister [[Abiy Ahmed]] took the [[Tigrean People's Liberation Front]] power. The company remained unknown when it was operated by TPLF. In June, parliamentary committee found that METEC squandered hundreds of machinery products worthing 326.4 million dollars without study of the market. 

Sources say that the [[Commercial Bank of Ethiopia]] squandered 2.8 million dollars without completion of sugar projects, and revealed the company borrowed 436 million dollars. 
===Kinfe Dagnew arrest===
On November 12, 2018, the Chief executive officer, Kinfe Dagnew, was attempting for escape through Sudan border. Upon arrival on the area, several Defence forces stopped and arrested him. He was founded with an empty briefcase believed to be illegally transport goods. Shortly after hours, a yellow private helicopter dispatched to handle the officers and the general; which brought him in the municipal city in Addis Ababa. 40 the company's officials were detained after they called for meeting in Imperial Hotel, Gerji, Addis Ababa.
Some newspapers quoted that they were transferred to Addis Ababa Police Commission; they temporarily jailed by Federal Police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ethsat.com/2018/11/ethiopia-over-40-officials-of-corruption-riddled-metec-members-of-intelligence-under-arrest/|title=Ethiopia: Over 40 officials of corruption riddled METEC, members of intelligence under arrest – The Ethiopian Satellite Television and Radio (ESAT)|website=ethsat.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ecommerce}}
The phrase '''mobile commerce''' was originally coined in 1997 by Kevin Duffey at the launch of the Global Mobile Commerce Forum, to mean "the delivery of [[electronic commerce]] capabilities directly into the consumer’s hand, anywhere, via [[wireless]] technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/jya/glomob.htm|title=Global Mobile Commerce Forum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many choose to think of Mobile Commerce as meaning "a retail outlet in your customer’s pocket."

The Global Mobile Commerce Forum, which came to include over 100 organisations, had its fully minuted launch in London on 10 November 1997. Kevin Duffey was elected as the Executive Chairman at the first meeting in November 1997.  The meeting was opened by Dr. Mike Short, former chairman of the [[GSM]] Association, with the very first forecasts for mobile commerce from Kevin Duffey (Group Telecoms Director of [[Logica]]) and Tom Alexander (later CEO of [[Virgin Mobile]] and then of Orange). Over 100 companies joined the Forum within a year, many forming mobile commerce teams of their own, e.g. MasterCard and Motorola. Of these one hundred companies, the first two were Logica and [[Cellnet]] (which later became O2).  Member organisations such as [[Nokia]], Apple, [[Alcatel (mobile device brand)|Alcatel]], and [[Vodafone]] began a series of trials and collaborations.

Mobile commerce services were first delivered in 1997, when the first two mobile-phone enabled [[Coca-Cola]] vending machines were installed in the [[Helsinki]] area in [[Finland]]. The machines accepted payment via [[SMS]] text messages. This work evolved to several new mobile applications such as the first mobile phone-based banking service was launched in 1997 by [[Merita Bank|Merita Bank of Finland]], also using SMS.  [[Finnair]] mobile check-in was also a major milestone, first introduced in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ahonen |first1=Tomi |title=Update on the mobile phone check-in: Finnair finds half of passengers using it |url=http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2009/02/update-on-the-mobile-phone-checkin-finnair-finds-half-of-passengers-using-it.html |website=Communities Dominate Brands |date=5 February 2009 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The m-Commerce(tm) server developed in late 1997 by Kevin Duffey and Andrew Tobin at Logica won the 1998 [[Financial Times]] award for "most innovative mobile product," in a solution implemented with De La Rue, Motorola and Logica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/de-la-rue-motorola-and-logica-win-financial-times-award-for-most-innovative-mobile-product-156092345.html|title=DE LA RUE, MOTOROLA AND LOGICA WIN FINANCIAL TIMES AWARD FOR MOST INNOVATIVE MOBILE PRODUCT /PR Newswire UK/|first=|last=Logica|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Financial Times commended the solution for "turning mobile commerce into a reality."{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  The trademark for m-Commerce was filed on 7 April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trademarkia.co.uk/uk/mcommerce-56494.htm|title=M-COMMERCE - Reviews &amp; Brand Information  - Logica Plc 250 Brook Drive  Green Park, Reading  GB RG2 6UA in European Community (CTM)|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823025335/http://www.trademarkia.co.uk/uk/mcommerce-56494.htm|archivedate=23 August 2015|df=dmy-all}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the first sales of digital content as downloads to mobile phones were made possible when the first commercial downloadable [[ringtone]]s were launched in Finland by [[Radiolinja]] (now part of [[Elisa Oyj]]).

Two major national commercial platforms for mobile commerce were launched in 1999: Smart Money in the [[Philippines]], and [[NTT DoCoMo]]'s [[i-Mode]] Internet service in [[Japan]]. i-Mode offered a revenue-sharing plan where NTT DoCoMo kept 9 percent of the fee users paid for content, and returned 91 percent to the content owner.

Mobile-commerce-related services spread rapidly in early 2000. [[Norway]] launched mobile parking payments. [[Austria]] offered train ticketing via mobile device. [[Japan]] offered mobile purchases of airline tickets.

In April 2002, building on the work of the Global Mobile Commerce Forum (GMCF), the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI) appointed Joachim Hoffmann of Motorola to develop official standards for mobile commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.etsi.org/m-comm/summary.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403000010/http://portal.etsi.org/m-comm/summary.asp |archivedate=3 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;  In appointing Mr Hoffman, ETSI quoted industry analysts as predicting "that m-commerce is poised for such an exponential growth over the next few years that could reach US$200 billion by 2004".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.etsi.org/m-comm/m-comm_ToR.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303231310/http://portal.etsi.org/m-comm/m-comm_ToR.asp |archivedate=3 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008, UCL Computer Science and [[Peter J. Bentley]] demonstrated the potential for medical applications on mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.peterjbentley.com/Blog/?e=53483&amp;d=08/29/2010&amp;s=iStethoscope%20Pro%20in%20a%20medical%20journal|title=iStethoscope in Medical Journal|accessdate=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PDA]]s and [[cellular phone]]s have become so popular that many businesses{{Specify|date=August 2010}} are beginning to use mobile commerce as a more efficient way to communicate with their customers.

In order to exploit the potential mobile commerce market, mobile phone manufacturers such as Nokia, Ericsson, Motorola, and [[Qualcomm]] are working with carriers such as AT&amp;T Wireless and Sprint to develop [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]]-enabled smartphones. Smartphones offer fax, e-mail, and phone capabilities.

"[[Profitability]] for device vendors and carriers hinges on high-end mobile devices and the accompanying killer applications," said Burchett.{{Who|date=August 2010}} Perennial early adopters, such as the youth market, which are the least price sensitive, as well as more open to premium mobile content and applications, must also be a key target for device vendors.

Since the launch of the [[iPhone]] in 2007, mobile commerce has moved away from SMS systems and into actual applications.  SMS has significant [[security vulnerabilities]]  and congestion problems, even though it is widely available and accessible. In addition, improvements in the capabilities of modern mobile devices make it prudent to place more of the resource burden on the mobile device.

More recently, [[brick and mortar business]] owners, and [[big-box store|big-box retailers]] in particular, have made an effort to take advantage of mobile commerce by utilizing a number of mobile capabilities such as [[location-based service]]s, [[Barcode reader#Cell phone cameras|barcode scanning]], and [[Apple Push Notification Service|push notifications]]  to improve the customer experience of shopping in physical stores. By creating what is referred to as a 'bricks &amp; clicks' environment, physical retailers can allow customers to access the common benefits of shopping online (such as product reviews, information, and coupons) while still shopping in the physical store. This is seen as a bridge between the gap created by e-commerce and in-store shopping, and is being utilized by physical retailers as a way to compete with the lower prices typically seen through online retailers. By mid summer 2013, "omnichannel" retailers (those with significant e-commerce and in-store sales) were seeing between 25% and 30% of traffic to their online properties originating from mobile devices. Some other pure play/online-only retail sites (especially those in the travel category) as well as flash sales sites and deal sites were seeing between 40% and 50% of traffic (and sometimes significantly more) originate from mobile devices.

The Google Wallet Mobile App&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/follow/topics/google-wallet/|title=Google Wallet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched in September 2011 and the m-Commerce joint venture formed in June 2011 between Vodafone, O2, Orange and T-Mobile are recent developments of note.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mobiletoday.co.uk/News/11829/Everything_Everywhere__O2_and_Vodafone_form_m-commerce_joint_venture.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting the importance of m-Commerce, in April 2012 the Competition Commissioner of the European Commission ordered an in-depth investigation of the m-Commerce joint venture between Vodafone, O2, Orange and T-Mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilenewscwp.co.uk/2012/04/16/vodafone-everything-everywhere-and-o2-still-confident-on-m-commerce-jv/|title=Vodafone, EE and O2 still confident on m-commerce JV|first=Mobile|last=News|date=16 April 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent survey states that 2012, 41% of smartphone customers have purchased retail products with their mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercuryminds.com/blog/company_news/introducing-mobile-commerce-solutions-for-online-retailers|title=Introducing Mobile Commerce solutions for online-retailers|accessdate=April 5, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330115537/http://www.mercuryminds.com/blog/company_news/introducing-mobile-commerce-solutions-for-online-retailers|archivedate=30 March 2013|df=dmy-all}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Products and services available ==

===Mobile money transfer===
In [[Kenya]] money transfer is mainly done through the use of mobile phones. This was an initiative of a multimillion shillings company in Kenya named Safaricom. Currently, the companies involved are Safaricom and Airtel. Mobile [[money transmitter|money transfer services]] in Kenya are now provided by the two companies under the names M-PESA and Airtel Money respectively.

A similar system called [[MobilePay]] has been operated by [[Danske Bank]] in [[Denmark]] since 2013. It has gained considerable popularity with about 1.6 million users by mid-2015. Another similar system called [[Vipps]] was introduced in [[Norway]] in 2015.

Mobile automated teller machine (ATM) is a special type of ATM. Most ATMs are meant to be stationary, and they’re often found attached to the side of financial institutions, in stores, and in malls. A mobile ATM machine, on the other hand, is meant to be moved from location to location. This type of ATM is often found at special events for which ATM service is only needed temporarily. For example, they may be found at carnivals, fairs, and parades. They may also be used at seminars and workshops when there is no regular ATM nearby.

Mobile ATMs are usually self-contained units that don’t need a building or enclosure. Usually, a mobile ATM can be placed in just about any location and can transmit transaction information wirelessly, so there's no need to have a phone line handy. Mobile ATMs may, however, require access to an electrical source, though there are some capable of running on alternative sources of power. Often, these units are constructed of weather-resistant materials, so they can be used in practically any type of weather conditions. Additionally, these machines typically have internal heating and air conditioning units that help keep them functional despite the temperature of the environment.ion of mobile money services for the unbanked, operators are now looking for efficient ways to roll out and manage distribution networks that can support cash-in and cash-out. Unlike traditional ATM, [[sicap]] Mobile ATM have been specially engineered to connect to mobile money platforms and provide bank grade ATM quality.
In Hungary, Vodafone allows cash or bank card payments of monthly phone bills.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vodafone.hu/eng/support/questions-answers/pay-monthly/paying-your-bill&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian market is one where direct debits are not standard practice, so the facility eases the burden of queuing for the postpaid half of Vodafone’s subscriber base in Hungary.

=== Mobile ticketing ===
{{Main article|Mobile ticketing}}

Tickets can be sent to mobile phones using a variety of technologies.  Users are then able to use their tickets immediately, by presenting their mobile phone at the ticket check as a digital boarding pass. Most numbers of users are now moving towards this technology. Best example would be [[IRCTC]] where ticket comes as SMS to users. New technology such as [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] can now be used to directly provide a single association digital ticket via the mobile device hardware associated with relevant software.

=== Mobile vouchers, coupons and loyalty cards ===
Mobile ticketing technology can also be used for the distribution of vouchers, coupons, and loyalty cards.  These items are represented by a virtual token that is sent to the mobile phone. A customer presenting a mobile phone with one of these tokens at the [[point of sale]] receives the same benefits as if they had the traditional token.  Stores may send coupons to customers using [[location-based service]]s to determine when the customer is nearby. Using a connected device and the networking effect can also allow for gamification within the shopping experience.

=== Content purchase and delivery ===
Currently, mobile content purchase and delivery mainly consist of the sale of ring-tones, wallpapers, and games for mobile phones.  The convergence of mobile phones, portable audio players, and video players into a single device is increasing the purchase and delivery of full-length music tracks and video. The download speeds available with [[4G]] networks make it possible to buy a movie on a mobile device in a couple of seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Niranjanamurthy, M., &amp; Kavyashree, N. (2013). Analysis of E-Commerce and M-Commerce: Advantages, Limitations, and Security issues. International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 2(6). 2360-2370&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Location-based services ===
{{Main article|Location-based service}}
The location of the mobile phone user is an important piece of information used during mobile commerce or m-commerce transactions.  Knowing the location of the user allows for [[location-based service]]s such as:
* Local discount offers
* Local weather
* Tracking and monitoring of people
* Data driven mashups targeting at a hyper-local level

=== Information services ===
A wide variety of information services can be delivered to mobile phone users in much the same way as it is delivered to PCs.  These services include:
* [[News]]
* [[Ticker tape|Stock quotes]]
* Sports scores
* Financial records
* [[Traffic reporting]]
* Emergency Alerts
* [[Location Based Notifications]]

Customized traffic information, based on a user's actual travel patterns, can be sent to a mobile device. This customized data is more useful than a generic traffic-report broadcast, but was impractical before the invention of modern mobile devices due to the [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] requirements.

=== Mobile banking ===
{{Main article|Mobile banking}}

Banks and other financial institutions use mobile commerce to allow their customers to access account information and make transactions, such as purchasing stocks, remitting money.  This service is often referred to as ''[[mobile banking]]'', or m-banking.

=== Mobile brokerage ===
Stock market services offered via mobile devices have also become more popular and are known as Mobile Brokerage.  They allow the subscriber to react to market developments in a timely fashion and irrespective of their physical location.

=== Auctions ===

Over the past three years{{When|date=August 2010}} [[mobile reverse auction]] solutions have grown in popularity.{{By whom|date=August 2010}} Unlike traditional auctions, the reverse auction (or low-bid auction) bills the consumer's phone each time they place a bid. Many mobile [[SMS]] commerce solutions rely on a one-time purchase or one-time subscription; however, reverse auctions offer a high return for the mobile vendor as they require the consumer to make multiple transactions over a long period of time.

=== Mobile browsing  ===
{{Main article|Mobile browser}}
Using a mobile browser—a [[World Wide Web]] browser on a mobile device—customers can shop online without having to be at their personal computer. Many [[mobile marketing]] apps with geo-location capability are now delivering user-specific marketing messages to the right person at the right time.

=== Mobile purchase ===
[[Catalog merchants]] can accept orders from customers electronically, via the customer's mobile device.  In some cases, the merchant may even deliver the catalog electronically, rather than mailing a paper catalog to the customer. Consumers making mobile purchases can also receive value-add [[upselling]] services and offers. Some merchants provide [[mobile web]] sites that are customized for the smaller screen and limited user interface of a mobile device.

===In-application mobile phone payments===

Payments can be made directly inside of an application running on a popular smartphone operating system, such as Google Android. Analyst firm Gartner expects in-application purchases to drive 41 percent of app store (also referred to as mobile software distribution platforms) revenue in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/in-app-payments-more-profitable-than-paid-apps-7000004110 |title=In-app payments more profitable than paid apps |work=ZDNet |accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In-app purchases can be used to buy [[virtual goods]], new and other mobile content and is ultimately billed by mobile carriers rather than the app stores themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paidcontent.org/2011/10/11/419-ericsson-enables-in-app-android-payments-via-carrier-bills |title=Ericsson Enables In-App Android Payments Via Carrier Bills |work=PaidContent |accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ericsson’s IPX mobile commerce system is used by 120 mobile carriers to offer payment options such as try-before-you-buy, rentals and subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiercemobilecontent.com/story/ericsson-brings-carrier-billing-app-payments/2011-10-12 |title=Ericsson brings carrier billing to in-app payments |work=Fierce Mobile Content |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2013-01-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211040551/http://www.fiercemobilecontent.com/story/ericsson-brings-carrier-billing-app-payments/2011-10-12 |archivedate=11 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile marketing and advertising ===
{{Main article|Mobile marketing}}
In the context of mobile commerce, '''mobile marketing''' refers to marketing sent to mobile devices. Companies have reported that they see better response from mobile marketing campaigns than from traditional campaigns. The primary reason for this is the instant nature of customer decision-making that mobile apps and websites enable. The consumer can receive a marketing message or discount coupon and, within a few seconds, make a decision to buy and go on to complete the sale - without disrupting their current real-world activity.

For example, a busy mom tending to her household chores with a baby in her arm could receive a marketing message on her mobile about baby products from a local store. She can and within a few clicks, place an order for her supplies without having to plan ahead for it. No more need to reach for her purse and hunt for credit cards, no need to log into her laptop and try to recall the web address of the store she visited last week, and surely no need to find a babysitter to cover for her while she runs to the local store.

Research demonstrates that consumers of mobile and wireline markets represent two distinct groups who are driven by different values and behaviors, and who exhibit dissimilar psychographic and demographic profiles.&lt;ref&gt;Schejter, A., Serenko, A., Turel, O., and Zahaf, M. (2010) "[http://www.aserenko.com/papers/policy_implications_serenko_proof.pdf Policy implications of market segmentation as a determinant of fixed-mobile service substitution: What it means for carriers and policy makers]", Telematics and Informatics, 27(1), 90-102.&lt;/ref&gt; What aspects truly distinguish between a traditional online shopper from home and a mobile on-the-go shopper? Research shows that how individuals relate to four situational dimensions- place, time, social context and control determine to what extent they are ubiquitous or situated as consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Banerjee, Syagnik (Sy) and Dholakia, Ruby Roy, "Situated or Ubiquitous? A Segmentation of Mobile E-Shoppers" (January 4, 2013). International Journal of Mobile Communications, Forthcoming. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2196689&lt;/ref&gt; These factors are important in triggering m-commerce from e-commerce. As a result, successful mobile commerce requires the development of marketing campaigns targeted to these particular dimensions and according to user segments.

==Influence on youth markets{{Anchor|Mobile Commerce's Influence on Youth Markets}}==

Mobile media is a rapidly changing field. New technologies, such as [[WiMax]], act to accelerate innovation in mobile commerce. Early pioneers in mobile advertising include [[Vodafone]], [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]], and [[SK Telecom]].

Mobile devices are heavily used in South Korea to conduct mobile commerce. Mobile companies in South Korea believed that mobile technology would become synonymous with youth lifestyle, based on their experience with previous generations of South Koreans. "Profitability for device vendors and carriers hinges on high-end mobile devices and the accompanying killer applications," said Daniel Longfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/press-release.pag?docid=72554850 |title=Mobile Device Vendors Turn to Growth Opportunities in Emerging Markets to Combat Fall in Average Price per Unit |last=Castilla |first=Mireya |date=June 16, 2006 |website=Frost &amp; Sullivan |access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Payment methods ==
{{Main article|Mobile payment}}
Consumers can use many forms of payment in mobile commerce, including:
* [[Contactless payment]] for in-person transactions through a mobile phone (such as [[Apple Pay]] or [[Android Pay]]).  In a system like [[EMV]], these are interoperable with contactless credit and debit cards.
* [[Premium-rate telephone number]]s, which apply charges to the consumer's long-distance bill
* Mobile-Operator Billing allows charges to be added to the consumer's mobile telephone bill, including deductions to pre-paid calling plans
* [[Credit card]]s and [[debit card]]s 
** Some providers allow credit cards to be stored in a phone's [[SIM card]] or secure element
** Some providers are starting to use [[host card emulation]], or HCE (e.g. [[Google Wallet]] and [[Softcard]])
** Some providers store [[credit card]] or [[debit card]] information in the cloud; usually in [[Tokenization (data security)|tokenized]].  With tokenization, payment verification, authentication, and authorization are still required, but payment card numbers don't need to be stored, entered, or transmitted from the mobile device
* [[Micropayment]] services
* [[Stored-value card]]s, often used with mobile-device application stores or music stores (e.g. iTunes)

== App design ==
[[Interaction design]] and [[User interface design|UX design]] has been at the core of the m-commerce experience from its conception, producing apps and mobile web pages that create highly usable interactions for users.&lt;ref&gt;Preece, J., Rogers, Y. and Sharpe, H. (2011), ''Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction'', Fourth., John Wiley &amp; Sons, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; However, much debate has occurred as to the focus that should be given to the apps. In recent research, Parker and Wang&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Wang|first2=Huchen|title=Examining hedonic and utilitarian motivations for m-commerce fashion retail app engagement|journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management: An International Journal|date=12 September 2016|volume=20|issue=4|pages=487–506|doi=10.1108/JFMM-02-2016-0015|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFMM-02-2016-0015|accessdate=11 November 2016}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that within [[fashion]] m-Commerce apps, the degree that the app helps the user shop (increasing convenience) was the most prominent function. Such use examples may be through design cues which help the user find their products with minimal search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Henninger|first2=Claudia E.|title=Enabling Sustainable Behaviours Through M-Commerce App Design: Focus on The Fast Fashion Industry|date=2018|publisher=Greenleaf Publishing|location=Sheffield|isbn=9781351058346|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-31aDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT89&amp;ots=c7LvxGu_Tl&amp;sig=2_ehssAPK46LlyrjiNdwSp9RSuo#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Additionally, shopping for others was a motivator for engaging in m-commerce apps with great preference for close integration with [[social media]].

== App commerce ==

The popularity of apps has given rise to the latest iteration of mobile commerce: app commerce. This refers to retail transactions that take place on a native mobile app. App commerce is said to perform better than both desktop and mobile web when it comes to browsing duration and interactions.&lt;ref name="MicrosoftBizBlog"&gt;[https://blogs.business.microsoft.com/en-gb/2017/08/01/rising-challenge-mobile-retail/ Microsoft UK Small and Medium Business Blog | Rising to the challenge of mobile in retail]&lt;/ref&gt; Average order value is reportedly greater with retail apps than traditional ecommerce, and conversion rates on apps are twice that of mobile websites.&lt;ref name="MicrosoftBizBlog" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3070">'''PMCD (PreMaster CD)''' is a specially formatted, recordable [[compact disc|Compact Disc]] designed to be sent to a [[CD manufacturing|CD pressing plant]] for replication. The PreMaster CD format, developed in the early 1990s by the [[CD-ROM]] division of [[Sony]], in cooperation with [http://www.startlab.co.jp "START Lab Inc."] of Tokyo and [[Sonic Solutions]], contained a hidden “PreMaster Cue Sheet” that held the metadata needed for replication that a ''Red Book'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] lacks. The PreMaster CD format made use of the fact that not all data-recording surfaces are specified for use in the ''Red Book'' CD-DA or ''Yellow Book'' CD-ROM standards. CD transports were not able to recover the data hidden in the Cue Sheet unless forced to buy proprietary software. The Cue Sheet specified a broad range of metadata, including number of channels, per track [[pre-emphasis]] status, per track [[copy protection]] bit setting, per track [[International Standard Recording Code|ISRC Codes]], per disc [[UPC code|UPC]]/[[European Article Number|EAN]], etc.

Despite claims to the contrary, only [[Sonic Solutions]]’ “Sonic System” software was able to generate PreMaster CDs. PMCDs were subsequently obsoleted by the more modern and generalized DDP specification. Several factors led to the decline of the PreMaster CD standard. First, the CD-R mechanisms that were able to read and write the hidden cue sheet metadata went out of production in the late 1990s. Second, only Laser Beam Recorders or LBRs manufactured by [[Sony]] were able to read PMCDs, which limited the formats adoption by replicators.

Many CD replicators now accept regular [[CD-R]] discs in place of true PMCDs, which can be created using specialized [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Audio CD]] pre-mastering software. Unfortunately, CD-Rs formatted as “Audio CDs,” which really are Red Book-formatted Orange Book discs, are not designed for disc replication, only content distribution. The [[Cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon coding|CIRC]] [[error correction]] used for the [[audio data]] on these discs is not as extensive as what is used for [[CD-ROM]] or [[DVD]] formats so, corruption of the audio data during readout due to dirt or mechanical damage could result in total loss of the audio data. Modern, professional pre-mastering software relies on the [[Disc Description Protocol|DDP format]], which protects both the audio data and its associated metadata.

[[File:Zackenschere.jpg|thumb|200px|Pinking shears]]
'''Pinking shears''' are [[scissors]], the blades of which are sawtoothed instead of straight.  They leave a [[zigzag]] pattern instead of a straight edge.

The pinking shears design was made by [[Samuel Briskman]] in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walter|first1=Grutchfeld|title=Pinking Shears Corporation|url=http://www.waltergrutchfield.net/pinking.htm|website=Fotos e Imagens|publisher=Walter Grutchfeld|accessdate=November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinking shears have a utilitarian function for cutting [[woven]] [[cloth]]. Cloth edges that are unfinished will easily fray, the weave becoming undone and threads pulling out easily. The sawtooth pattern does not prevent the fraying but limits the length of the frayed thread and thus minimizes damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hinze|first1=H.|title=The Pinking Machine -- Its Uses|journal=The Clothing Designer and Manufacturer|date=April 1916|volume=9|issue=1|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These scissors can also be used for decorative cuts and a number of patterns (arches, sawtooth of different aspect ratios, or asymmetric teeth) are available. True dressmaker's pinking shears, however, should not be used for paper decoration because paper dulls the cutting edge.

== Etymology ==
The cut produced by pinking shears may have been derived from the plant called a [[Pink (flower)|pink]], a [[flowering plant]] in the genus ''[[Dianthus]]'' (commonly called a carnation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Philip R.|last1=Pankiewicz|title=American Scissors and Shears|publisher=Universal-Publishers|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The color [[pink]] may have been named after these flowers, although the origins of the name are not definitively known. As the carnation has scalloped, or "pinked", edges to its [[petals]], pinking shears can be thought to produce an edge similar to the flower.

The word "[[pink]]" can be used as a verb dating back to 1300 meaning "pierce, stab, make holes in".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1497">A '''range gate''' is an electronic circuit that selects signals within a given time period; the "gate" allows signals to pass through only within the selected time. The term is mostly used in [[radar]], where range gates are used to select certain targets for further processing. It is also used in [[lidar]], [[time-of-flight camera]]s and similar roles.

In early military radars, range gates were used to select a single target and then pass on this information to other displays where more information could be seen. An example is the [[AI Mk. IX radar]], where the radar operator would use a ''strobe'', an on-screen cursor, to select a single target. A range gate would then filter out all the other targets that might be visible to the radar. The return within that gate was then automatically tracked without further operator intervention.

In [[weather radar]], it is common to have a series of continual range gates that separate out returns at different distances and then process them to extract [[Doppler shift]] to measure wind speed. In these cases, it is common to refer to each gate as a '''range bin'''.

The development of artificial intelligence (“AI”), in particular relative to robots, has gained increasing importance worldwide. First used exclusively in the industrial sector, the use of robots has now extended to all aspects of our life, including services and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oberson |first1=Xavier |title=Taxer les robots?, L’émergence d’une capacité contributive électronique |journal=Pratique juridique actuelle, Dike Verlag AG |date=1 January 2017 |page= 232 |url=http://www.xavieroberson.com/index.php/2017/02/16/taxer-les-robots-lemergence-dune-capacite-contributive-electronique/ |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oberson |first1=Xavier |title=Taxer les robots? |journal=Bilan |date=6 July 2016 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The progression of robots’ impact on our society necessarily requires new reflections, which, in addition to the ethical question, also imply social, economic, legal and job problems. Legislative resolutions will have to be adopted, which will in particular deal with the taxation of the use of robots, under penalty of serious consequences on world growth.Indeed, without legislative intervention, the scheme would be as follows:

- On the one hand, the constant replacement of human activities by robots will have a major impact on employment. In the absence of adequate taxation, the situation is likely to cause serious tax losses and increase the social security deficit;

- On the other hand, the loss of employment resulting from the hiring of robots instead of human beings will generate the need for additional financial resources, in particular in order to ensure a social minimum as well as professional reintegration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oberson |first1=Xavier |title=Vers une imposition des robots ou de leur usage ? |journal=Expert Focus, EXPERTsuisse |date=1 November 2017 |page=896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders of the industrial and scientific communities argue that, to offset the social costs created by automation’s displacement effects, either robots should pay [[income tax]], or their owners should pay a tax for replacing a worker with a robot. Further, "robot tax" should be used to finance a universal [[basic income]] or guaranteed living wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varoufakis|first1=Yanis|title=A Tax on Robots?|url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/bill-gates-tax-on-robots-by-yanis-varoufakis-2017-02|website=Innovation &amp; Technology|accessdate=4 March 2017|author-link=Yanis Varoufakis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Gates said the solution to the problem is simple, the government should start taxing robots i.e. make the robot owners cough up the money needed to re-establish the defunct workforce. Such opinion is however highly criticized. For example, Mr  Andrus Ansip, EU Commissioner tasked with bringing Europe to the digital age, is against such opinion. Mr Andrus Ansip considers that a robot tax would only mean someone else would take the leading position and leave Europe behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chakraborty|first1=Anish|title=Robot Tax?|url=https://www.blogarama.com/global-affairs-blogs/1279190-newsbytes-latest-news-breaking-india-today-current-blog/20668140-robot-tax-bill-says-yay-commissioner-nay|website=Blogarama|publisher=Blogarama.com|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tshilidzi Marwala]] argues that many systems we use today have intelligent and robotics features and these make the task of taxing robots very difficult to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marwala|first1=Tshilidzi|title=On Robot Revolution and Taxation|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1808/1808.01666.pdf|website=arXiv|publisher=Cornell University Library|accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, a new form of fiscal capacity (contributive capacity) should emerge with the development of robot autonomy.

The taxation of robots or their use presupposes a clear legal definition of their status. The idea is to envisage the creation of a new type of legal personality. Several definitions have been proposed, which generally focus on the autonomy and decision-making process of robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oberson |first1=Xavier |title=Taxer les robots?, L’émergence d’une capacité contributive électronique |journal=Pratique juridique actuelle, Dike Verlag AG |date=2017 |page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 1 January 2017, the European Union Parliament approved a report, accompanied by various recommendations, which envisages the emergence of an “electronic personality of robots".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parlement européen |title=Report with Recommendations to the Commission on Civil Law Rules on Robot-ics |ref=(A8-0005/2017)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In tax matters, the central character should be the use of artificial intelligence, which will allow the robot to make its own decisions, to be autonomous and to learn, characteristics that go far beyond the state of a simple machine, and this regardless of its mechanical appearance.

The recognition of a legal personality specific to robots also implies the recognition of an electronic contributory capacity, which would allow characterising robots as legal persons, vested with various rights and obligations. Robots would consequently become fiscal subjects and become subject to special taxation.

However, even if robots can replace a paid human activity, they do not yet have their own ability to pay (taxable income). It is not the robot as such that must be imposed but its use. A contributory capacity specific to robots could be admitted when the technology will allow robots to allocate them a capacity of payment (electronic liquidity, capital, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oberson |first1=Xavier |title=Taxing Robots ? From the Emergence of an Electronic Ability to Pay to a Tax on Robots or the Use of Robots |journal=World Tax Journal |date=4 April 2017 |volume=9, n. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a fiscal capacity of robots has been recognized, several types of taxation could be considered. Assuming that the robot replaces a salaried human activity, one could consider a tax on the “hypothetical salary attributable" to the robot, which would correspond to the income that the human being would earn for an equivalent job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oberson |first1=Xavier |title=Taxer les robots?, L’émergence d’une capacité contributive électronique |journal=Pratique juridique actuelle, Dike Verlag AG |date=2017 |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oberson |first1=Xavier |title=Taxing Robots ?

A '''smart camera''' or '''intelligent camera''' is a [[machine vision]] system which, in addition to image capture circuitry, is capable of extracting application-specific information from the captured images, along with generating event descriptions or making decisions that are used in an intelligent and automated system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Smart Cameras | author = Ahmed Nabil Belbachir (Ed.) | publisher = Springer | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4419-0952-7 | url = https://www.springer.com/engineering/signals/book/978-1-4419-0952-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A smart camera is a self-contained, standalone vision system with built-in image sensor in the housing of an industrial video camera. It contains all necessary communication interfaces, e.g. Ethernet, as well as industry-proof 24V I/O lines for connection to a [[Programmable logic controller|PLC]], actuators, relays or pneumatic valves. It is not necessarily larger than an industrial or [[surveillance camera]]. A capability in [[machine vision]] generally means a degree of development such that these capabilities are ready for use on individual applications.  This architecture has the advantage of a more compact volume compared to PC-based vision systems and often achieves lower cost, at the expense of a somewhat simpler (or omitted) [[user interface]].

Although often used for simpler applications, modern smart cameras can rival PCs in terms of processing power and functionalities.  Smart cameras have been marketed since the mid 80s.  In the 21st century they have reached widespread use, since technology allowed their size to be reduced and their processing power reached several thousand MIPS (devices with 1&amp;nbsp;GHz processors and up to 8000MIPS are available as of end of 2006).

Having a dedicated processor in each unit, smart cameras are especially suited for applications where several cameras must operate independently and often asynchronously, or when distributed vision is required (multiple inspection or surveillance points along a production line or within an assembly machine).

[[File:MicroScanner VC smartcamera.jpg|right|frame|Early smart camera (ca. 1985, in red) with an 8MHz Z80 compared to a modern device featuring Texas Instruments' C64 @1GHz]]

A smart camera usually consists of several (but not necessarily all) of the following components:

* Image sensor (matrix or linear, [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]- or [[CMOS]])
* Image [[Digitize|digitization]] circuitry
* Image memory
* [[central processing unit|processor]] (often a [[digital signal processor|DSP]] or suitably powerful processor)
* program- and data memory (RAM, nonvolatile FLASH)
* Communication interface ([[RS232]], [[Ethernet]])
* [[Input/output|I/O]] lines (often optoisolated)
* Lens holder or built in lens (usually C, CS or M-mount)
* Built in illumination device (usually [[LED]])
* Purpose developed real-time operating system (For example VCRT)
* Optional video output (e.g. [[VGA]] or [[SVGA]]) 

== Fields of application ==

Smart cameras can in general be used for the same kind of applications where more complex vision systems are used, and can additionally be applied in some applications where volume, pricing or reliability constraints forbid use of bulkier devices and PC's.

Typical fields of application are:
* [[automated inspection]] for [[quality assurance]] (detection of defects, flaws, missing parts...)
* non contact measurements.
* part sorting and identification.
* code reading and verification ([[barcode]], [[Data Matrix]], [[Optical character recognition|alphanumeric]] etc.)
* web inspection (inspection of continuously flowing materials such as coils, tubes, wires, extruded plastic) for defect detection and dimensional gauging.
* detection of position and rotation of parts for [[robot]] guidance and automated picking
* unattended surveillance (detection of intruders, fire or smoke detection)
* [[biometrics|biometric]] recognition and access control ([[Facial recognition system|face]], [[fingerprint]], [[Iris scan|iris]] recognition)
* [[visual sensor network]]s
* robot guidance
* nearly any [[machine vision]] application

Developers can purchase smart cameras and develop their own programs for special, custom made applications, or they can purchase ready made [[application software]] from the camera manufacturer or from [[Third-party source|third party]] sources.
Custom programs can be developed by programming in various languages (typically [[C programming language|C]] or [[C++]]) or by using more intuitive, albeit somewhat less flexible, [[Visual programming language|visual development tools]] where existing functionalities (often called tool or blocks) can be connected in a list (a sequence or a bidimensional flowchart) that describes the desired [[Dataflow|flow of operations]] without any need to write program code.
The main advantage of the visual approach Vs. programming is in a much shorter and somewhat easier development process, available also to non-programmers.
Other development tools are available with relatively few but comparatively high level functionalities, which can be configured and deployed with very limited effort.

Smart cameras running software tailored for a single specific application are often called "vision sensors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Handbook of Machine Vision | author = Alexander Hornberg | publisher = Wiley-VCH | year = 2006 | isbn = 3-527-40584-4 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KOBE93z4Eu4C&amp;pg=PA703&amp;dq=vision-sensor+smart-camera&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=RHUaSfjACIewswO3keS8CA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some consumer [[digital camera]]s are called "Smart Camera" due to features such as running a [[mobile operating system]].

The [[Jinan]] solar highway opened in China in December 2017 along a 1.2 mile stretch. It uses [[transparent concrete]] on the top layer with the solar panels underneath. It was the second solar roadway in the city, the first opened in September 2017 using a different technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://electrek.co/2017/12/21/china-solar-roadways-transparent-concrete-solar-cells-charge-cars/ |title=China is building solar roadways – ‘transparent concrete’ atop solar cells that charge driving cars |work=Electrek |author=John Fitzgerald Weaver |date=December 21, 2017 |accessdate=January 15, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116135255/https://electrek.co/2017/12/21/china-solar-roadways-transparent-concrete-solar-cells-charge-cars/ |archivedate=January 16, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2017/12/30/china-opens-1-kilometer-long-solar-road/ |title=China Opens 1-Kilometer Long Solar Road |work=CleanTechnica |author=Steve Hanley  |date=December 30, 2017 |accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar Road Panels===
The main purpose of solar roadways is to replace asphalt roads with Solar Panels which generate energy through the sun that can be used by local houses or businesses that are connected to the system from either the house’s driveway or the businesses parking lot. The panels will also increase the number of charging stations for electric cars if that station is connected to the solar roadway. Each panel is roughly 12’ by 12’ of interlocking panels that have their own LED lights that will be used as the road lines, and can also be used to spell out words like “Reduce Speed” or “Traffic Ahead” to help the flow of traffic.&lt;ref name = Ranjan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ranjan|first1=Rajeev|title=Solar Power Roads: Revitalising Solar Highways, Electrical Power and Smart Grids|journal=International Journal of Engineering Research and General Science|date=January–February 2015|volume=3|issue=1|pages=380–385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 3 layers that make up the solar panels:

1. The Road Surface Layer - The Road Layer is the High Strength layer that has the photovoltaic cells which attracts the sun’s rays, it has traction so vehicles don’t slide off the road, and it’s waterproof to protect the layers below.&lt;ref name = Ranjan/&gt;

2. The Electronic Layer - The Electronic Layers contain a mini microprocessor board that helps control the heating element of the panels, this technology can help melt the snow that lands on the panels so that hazardous road conditions will no longer be an issue in the more northern regions. This layer can sense how much weight is on the panels and can control the heating element to melt the snow.&lt;ref name = Ranjan/&gt;

3. The Base Plate Layer - The Base Plate Layer is the layer that collects the energy from the sun and distributes the power to the homes or businesses that are connected to the solar roadways. This will also be used to transfer the energy to cars as they drive over the strip to recharge the battery.&lt;ref name = Ranjan/&gt;

===Criticism===
''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine stated that solar roadways would produce less electricity than solar cells that are placed at an angle, and that less light would touch them because of shade, dirt covering the road, and cars blocking the sun from touching the panels. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2017/12/solar_roads_are_almost_definitely_not_the_future.html|title=What Is the Point of a Solar Road?|first=Neel V.|last=Patel|date=December 28, 2017|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have pointed out that solar roadways would be both more expensive, and less productive than more conventional ways of combining solar power with infrastructure, such as building shelters over roads and parking areas and putting traditional solar panels on the roofs; [[Elon Musk]] demonstrated that there is ample space in the US, apart from roads, to fulfill the power requirements of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.equities.com/news/elon-musk-demonstrates-why-solar-roadways-would-be-really-silly|title=Elon Musk Demonstrates Why Solar Roadways Would be Really Silly|last=equities.com|work=Equities.com|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smart pavement===
The Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) began testing out “smart pavement” at a rest stop outside of Conway, Missouri along historic Route 66 late in 2016. The pilot program currently covers about 200 square feet of sidewalk at the visitor center and cost $100,000 (Landers), largely subsidized by the Federal Highway Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cronkleton|first1=Robert A.|title=Missouri’s solar roadways to begin with sidewalk at historic Route 66 Welcome Center|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article93755517.html|accessdate=20 April 2017|agency=Kansas City Star|date=August 4, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511125201/http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article93755517.html|archivedate=11 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It’s all part of Missouri’s Road to Tomorrow initiative to find new innovations in their transportation infrastructure. Missouri wants to take advantage of these roadways to implement other, related technologies. The panels will heat the road and keep snow and ice from accumulating. They will also feature LED diodes that will increase the visibility of road lines. The LEDs would also double in helping prevent paint from inhibiting solar power generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landers|first1=Jay|title=Missouri to Test Solar Roadways, Smart Pavement as Part of Road to Tomorrow Project|journal=Civil Engineering—ASCE|date=2016|volume=86|issue=9|pages=30–31|url=http://cedb.asce.org/CEDBsearch/record.jsp?dockey=0352321|accessdate=20 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504172325/http://cedb.asce.org/CEDBsearch/record.jsp?dockey=0352321|archivedate=4 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panels have not had enough time to determine durability, energy efficiency, or cost effectiveness in a real world sense yet, so MoDOT has not reach any conclusions about feasibility and future application yet.

==Wireless vehicle charging==
{{See|In-road electric vehicle charger|Inductive charging|Wireless power transfer}}

The [[Online Electric Vehicle]] being developed by [[KAIST]] (the &amp;nbsp;Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) has electrical circuits built into the road which will power suitably adapted vehicles via contactless [[electromagnetic induction]]. A pilot system powering electric buses is under development. Germany's [[IAV#In-road electric vehicle charger|IAV]] is another company that is developing induction chargers.

===Electromechanical batteries===
Roadway-powered electric vehicle system is the patent held by Howard R. Ross. It has several components. The first of which is an all electric vehicle that would be fit with electromechanical batteries that accept a charge from the road. The road is the second component and would have strategically placed charging coils as to only charge the car when needed. These cars and roads would not require gas or solar power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=H.R.|title=Roadway-Powered Electric Vehicle System|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US5669470|website=Google Patents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowhere in the world is an invention like this currently implemented, and this is due to the cost of the infrastructure overhaul that would be needed to bring this patent into reality.

== Road markings ==
[[File:Glowing Lines Roosegaarde.jpg|thumb|Glowing Lines, Studio Roosegaarde]]
The ''Smart Highway'' concept developed by [[Studio Roosegaarde]] and the infrastructure management group [[Heijmans]] in the Netherlands incorporated [[Photoluminescence|photo-luminescent]] paint for road markings, which absorb light during the day then glow for up to 10 hours. The technology was demonstrated on a stretch of highway in [[North Brabant|Brabant]], Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Liat |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-10/30/smart-highway-glows-in-the-dark |title=Netherlands highways will glow in the dark from mid-2013 (Wired UK) |publisher=Wired.co.uk |accessdate=2014-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530095727/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-10/30/smart-highway-glows-in-the-dark |archivedate=2014-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27021291 |title=Glow in the dark road unveiled in the Netherlands |publisher=BBC |date=2014-04-14 |accessdate=2014-06-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703073055/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27021291 |archivedate=2014-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frost protection and melting snow, ice ==
[[Snowmelt system]]s using electricity or hot water to heat roads and pavements have been installed in various locations.

[[Solar Roadways]] has proposed including a snowmelt system with their photovoltaic road panels since the panels already have electrical power connections for harvesting photovoltaic power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/01/19/smart.roads/ "Solar-powered 'smart' roads could zap snow, ice"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204050905/http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/01/19/smart.roads/ |date=2017-02-04 }}, Thom Patterson.

'''Solar cell fabric''' is a fabric with embedded [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] (PV) cells which generate electricity when exposed to light.

Traditional silicon based solar cells are expensive to manufacture, rigid and fragile. Although less efficient, thin-film cells and organic polymer based cells can be produced quickly and cheaply. They are also flexible and can be stitched onto fabric.

According to an article from [[New Scientist]]  &lt;ref name="newscientist.com"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn618-power-dressing.html NewScientist]&lt;/ref&gt; researchers have built a PV cell in the layers around a fiber, creating a tiny cylindrical cell. No longer limited to rooftops and poles, solar collection could work silently and unobtrusively from everyday objects.

==Examples of recent research==

Flexible solar cells can be used in humanitarian aid. A makeshift shelter developed by [[PowerFilm, Inc.]] called the PowerShade can generate one kilowatt of power. This could help a power emergency equipment at short notice in remote places.

[[Konarka Technologies]] produce a thin film polymer based PV cell, as a flexible film stitched onto a fabric. The ability to make these cells even smaller is dependent on further research into nanocrystal PV cells. In theory nanotechnology could provide a way to expand the range of photons a cell could collect, increasing its efficiency while becoming smaller. Konarka, in partner with other institutions, is working on this.

ShadePlex is currently developing a product that integrates thin film photovoltaic modules with architectural fabrics.  They will feature a high power output (200 W, 500 W, and 1000 W), and can feed either a battery system or be tied to the grid.  Integrating thin film photovoltaics with [[fabric structure]]s will enable a whole class of buildings to easily integrate renewable energy solutions.

The '''TAI Anka''' is a family of [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAV) developed by [[Turkish Aerospace Industries]] (TAI) for the requirements of the [[Turkish Armed Forces]]. Basic Anka-A is classified as a [[Medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle|Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) UAV]]. Envisioned in the early 2000s for tactical surveillance and reconnaissance missions, the Anka has now evolved into a modular platform with [[synthetic aperture radar]], precise weapons and satellite communication. The drone is named after a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]-like mythological creature called ''[[Zumrud-u Anka|Zümrüd-ü Anka]]'' (''Anka kuşu'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].)

==Design==
The TUAV system consists of three air vehicles (A/V), Ground Control Station (GCS), Ground Data Terminal (GDT), Automatic Take-off, and Landing System (ATOLS), Transportable Image Exploitation System (TIES), Remote Video Terminal (RVT) and various Ground Support Equipment (GSE).

The TUAV system, which is designed for night and day missions including adverse weather conditions, performs real-time image intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, moving/stationery target detection, recognition, identification, and tracking missions.&lt;ref name="TRDEFENCE"&gt;{{cite web|title=TAI Unveils ANKA Unmanned Airplane|url=http://www.trdefence.com/?p=1121|publisher=TRDefence|accessdate=2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the TUAV system has an [[open architecture]] to support other potential payloads and missions, within the context of the existing project the air vehicle is configured to carry the following payloads on board:&lt;ref name="TAI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkish Indigenous MALE UAV (Anka)|url=https://www.tai.com.tr/en/product/anka-multi-role-isr-system |publisher=TAI|accessdate=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Electro-optic Color Day Camera (EO Day TV)
* Electro-optic/[[Forward Looking Infrared]]/[[Laser rangefinder]]/[[Laser Designator]] and Spotter Camera (EO/FLIR/LRF/LDS)
* Synthetic Aperture Radar/[[Ground Moving Target Indicator]] (SAR/GMTI)
* [[Inverse SAR]] (ISAR)

The whole composite airframe is composed of a monoblock fuselage, detachable wing and V-Tail, retractable landing gear, redundant control surfaces, avionics and payload bays and service doors. The sandwich skin structure is reinforced by composite or metallic frames, ribs, and supports. Propelled by a pusher type heavy fuel engine, the aircraft is furnished with fuselage fuel tanks and fuel system, ice protection system, environmental control system, lighting system, redundant electrical system with battery backup, and harness system.

The platform is also equipped with a digital flight control system, electro-mechanical actuators, and flight control sensor systems such as GPS, pitot-static, air data computer, navigation sensor, transducers, temperature, pressure, displacement sensors, etc.&lt;ref name=ROCKWELL&gt;{{cite web|title=Rockwell Collins selected to provide guidance and navigation system for Turkish Aerospace Industries’ Anka Unmanned Aerial Vehicle |url=http://rockwellcollins.com/sitecore/content/Data/News/2011_Cal_Yr/GS/FY11GSNR22-TAI_release.aspx|publisher=Rockwell Collins|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various tasks are distributed along flight management computers and auxiliary control boxes. Identification and communication units and interface computers are employed in order to establish real time wide band communication and provide test and diagnostics functions. An air traffic radio is also integrated in the communication system for the integration of the aircraft into the civilian airspace. All flight critical equipment are dual or triple redundant and emergency modes of operational scenarios are taken into consideration for fail safe design.

All airborne and ground-based flight control software is developed by TAI while payload hardware and software items are aimed to be developed by national sub-contractors, such as Aselsan and Milsoft.

UAV operations are supported by highly sophisticated ground control system with complete redundancy, developed by a domestic defence company Savronik.&lt;ref name=SAVRONIK&gt;[http://www.savronik.com.tr/en/?defence-programs&amp;07 Unmanned Air Vehicle Ground Control Station Shelter], ''Savronik''. Retrieved 1 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Whole mission segments of the air vehicle can be managed, monitored and controlled by a GCS. A pre-programmed mission plan can be loaded before the flight begins or can be altered during the flight. All the imagery stream of the payloads can be displayed and recorded in real time and all the payloads can be controlled from the GCS. ATOLS allows the air vehicle to perform its operation without operator intervention, including the most critical phases which are landing and take-off.

In TIES, valuable intelligence information can be obtained by the analysis of bulky imagery data. TIES operators can initiate intelligence missions prior to or during flight. Refined information flows to the upper command layer in order to assist the headquarters to monitor a network of TUAV systems and benefit from the gathered intelligence information. Another interface of the TUAV system is the RVT, with which other friendly units who are close to the target area can utilize the real time imagery that TUAV air vehicle broadcasts.

==Development==
The contract regarding the development of an indigenous Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]] (UAV) system for the reconnaissance requirements of the Turkish Armed Forces became effective on 24 December 2004. Within the framework of the program, a total of three prototypes and ground systems will be designed, developed, manufactured, and tested by mid-2011 as part of the prototype development phase. Subsequently, in 2012, the serial production phase of Anka-A would be launched and additional 10 systems (meaning 30 air vehicles) built for the Turkish Air Force.

* On 30 December 2010, the first TAI Anka unmanned aerial vehicle completed its debut flight, with 14 minutes of cruising, at 15:45 local time.&lt;ref name="HURRIYET_JAN_2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eksi|first=Ozgur|title=Hürriyet: Ve ANKA uçtu |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/16660379.asp?gid=373|accessdate=4 January 2011|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defence Minister Vecdi Gönül confirmed the flight.&lt;ref name=ZAMAN_01&gt;[http://www.zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=1074255&amp;title=insansiz-hava-araci-gelistirme-projesi-imzalandi "First flight of Anka took place last week, on Thursday", stated Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314013833/http://www.zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=1074255&amp;title=insansiz-hava-araci-gelistirme-projesi-imzalandi |date=14 March 2012 }}, Zaman, Retrieved 4 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anka +A===
On July 19, 2012, the Turkish Defense Industry Executive Committee (SSIK) announced that Turkish Aerospace Industries had commenced research and development for the design and development of a "hunter killer" High-Altitude Long-Endurance version of the Anka UAV, named the Anka +A. It was planned that Anka +A will carry Cirit missiles of Turkey's [[Roketsan]]. The engines of the Anka +A UCAV had not yet been determined. It might have more powerful turbo engines or it could have gas turbine engine.  The weight of Anka +A UCAV would be more than 4 tons compared to Anka Block A's 1.5 tons. It was highly expected that the UCAV would be presented to public in the events of IDEF'13 on 7–10 May 2013.&lt;ref name=HDN&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-set-to-produce-its-own-armed-uavs.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=25830&amp;NewsCatID=345|title=Turkey Set to Produce its own Armed UAVs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SUNDAYSZAMAN&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sundayszaman.com/sunday/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=286926|title=Turkey to manufacture armed version of national drone |date=18 July 2012|publisher=Sunday's Zaman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ZAMAN_02&gt;[http://www.zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=1321448&amp;title=ankalar-silahlaniyor Zaman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723172803/http://www.zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=1321448&amp;title=ankalar-silahlaniyor |date=23 July 2012 }} Anka UAVs are getting armed&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YOUTUBE&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwUeMD757e4|title=Anka MURAD BAYAR TRT AVAZ KANALINA KONUK OLDU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Configurations==
Turkey's Directorate for Defence Industries has been stressing advanced variants of the Anka with larger payload capacity, extending Block A capabilities to the features like:
*[[Communications satellite|SATCOM]]
*[[SIGINT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.janes.com/article/78883/turkey-s-anka-uav-gains-sigint-capabilities?from_rss=1 |publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]] |title=Turkey’s Anka UAV gains SIGINT capabilities |first=Lale |last=Sariibrahimoglu |quote=SSM did not give any more details, but Turkey’s NTV news channel reported on 26 March that the new version is destined for the Turkish National Intelligence Agency (MIT).|date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Air-to-ground_weaponry|Air-to-ground]] and air-to-air missile integration
According to the authority, the Anka will eventually have an indigenous 155&amp;nbsp;hp turbo-prop engine developed by TUSAŞ Engine Industries (TEI), with the cooperation of local companies in the future.

=== ANKA-B ===
[[File:TAI-ANKA-UAV-FAR14-3659.JPG|thumb|Anka Block B with SAR Radar.]]
On January 30, 2015, the ANKA-B completed its maiden flight successfully. Anka Block B is an improved version of the Anka Block A. The UAV carries an Aselsan synthetic aperture radar/ground moving-target indicator payload in addition to the platform’s electro-optical/infrared sensor. During the maiden flight, Anka-B successfully performed "basic shakedown" and auto-landing. The Anka Block B also has a greater payload capacity than that of the Anka-A which includes SAR/ISAR/GMTI radar (in addition to the cameras of Anka A) that obtains and remits high resolution intelligence data back to base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.trthaber.com/haber/bilim-teknik/yeni-nesil-anka-goklerde-165302.html |publisher=TRT News |title=Yeni nesil "ANKA" göklerde |first=|last=|quote=|date=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.janes.com/article/48513/turkey-s-anka-block-b-uav-completes-maiden-flight |publisher=[[IHS Jane's Defence Weekly]] |title=Turkey's Anka Block-B UAV completes maiden flight |first=Lale |last=Sariibrahimoglu |quote= |date=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anka Block B paved the way for weaponisation of the platform in the foreseeable future. Anka Block B passed 30.000 feet, 26 hours and 200&amp;nbsp;km radius during the test flights. Turkish Air Force ordered 10 Anka Block B in 2013 at a cost of $300 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/upgraded-anka-carries-out-maiden-flight-408567/ |publisher=Flight Global |title=Upgraded Anka carries out maiden flight |first=Beth |last=Stevenson |quote=|date=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ANKA-S ===
[[File:TaiIDEF2015.JPG|thumb|Anka-s with modified radome for SATCOM.]]
ANKA-S is a serial production configuration of ANKA. It is equipped with ViaSat's VR-18C Highpower [[Communications satellite|SATCOM]] antenna and a national flight control computer. Like Block A and Block B, Anka-S will be powered by [[Thielert Centurion|Thielert Centurion 2.0S]]. On the other hand, Turkish Engine Industries (TEI) has been developing a national engine, capable of running with diesel and JP-8 jet fuel.

On October 25, 2013, Turkish Undersecretariat for Defence Industry (SSM) ordered 10 Anka-S UAVs and 12 ground control stations for $290 million ($220.6 million + TRY 137 million). The UAVs would be delivered in three batches (2+4+4). The first batch was planned to be delivered in March 2017. A total of 6 aircraft were planned to be delivered in 2017.

In 2016, media reported that the TAI was manufacturing 4 Anka-S UAVs for the armed forces. The first two of these aircraft were to be equipped with StarFIRE 380-HDL FLIR payload. However, these would be replaced with Aselsan CATS later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2016|title=İnsansız Hava Aracı İHA Projeleri|url=|journal=SAVUNMA VE HAVACILIK| volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

On August 17, 2018, Directorate for Defence Industries announced that the Anka-S completed its first live fire tests. The platform was tested with MAM-L ammunition developed by the Roketsan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.janes.com/article/82468/satellite-controlled-anka-s-uav-fires-guided-munitions |publisher=[[IHS Jane's Defence Weekly]] |title=Satellite-controlled Anka-S UAV fires guided munitions |first=Lale |last=Sariibrahimoglu |quote= |date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, Ismail Demir, director of the Turkey's defence industry authority, shared a picture of the first Anka-S equipped with Aselsan CATS optical system.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/IsmailDemirSSB/status/1044620673581285376&lt;/ref&gt; TAI delivered 2 more ANKA-S to [[Turkish Air Force]] in September 2018,&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/SavunmaSanayii/status/1042381426493153280&lt;/ref&gt; increasing the Anka-S inventory of Turkish Air Force to 8 aircraft.

Some sources claimed that the cancellation was due to the disagreements between [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] government of then Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] and the Egyptian military regime led by General [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]], while other sources stated the deal was never finalized. Recep Tayyip Erdogan was supporting [[Muslim Brotherhood]] candidate [[Mohamed Morsi]] during Egyptian presidential election in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Turkey suspends delivery of ANKA drones to Egypt’|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-suspends-delivery-of-anka-drones-to-egypt.aspx?pageID=517&amp;nID=52474|publisher=[[Hürriyet Daily News]]|date=14 August 2013|quote=There never was an agreement between Turkey and Egypt for the sale of the Turkish drone ANKA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tastet''' is a word of [[Catalan language|Catalan]] origin meaning 'a small taste of food'. The tastet is a variation of the [[tapas]] serving style; larger and more complex than tapas but smaller than a plate. Emphasis is placed on taste and presentation. The tastet can be served as an appetizer or as a small collection for a complete meal. The tastet serving style allows for the appreciation of several flavours within a single meal.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Restaurants may favour the tastet as a specialised menu format, and may offer all their tastets at a uniform price. One such restaurant is "El Jardi Del Tastets"  in [[Palamos]], [[Spain]]. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.eljardidelstastets.com] El Jardi Dels Tastets&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Termoigrografo 01.jpg|thumb|A thermo-hygrograph]]

A '''thermo-hygrograph''' or '''hygrothermograph''' is a [[chart recorder]] that measures and records both [[temperature]] and [[humidity]] (or [[dew point]]). Similar devices that record only one parameter are a '''thermograph''' for temperature and '''hygrograph''' for humidity.

Thermographs where the variations are recorded using [[Photography#Science and forensics|photography]] were described by several scientists as early as 1845, including [[Francis Ronalds]] who was Honorary Director of the [[Kew Observatory]].  An updated model of the initial machine was deployed across the national observational network set up by the new UK [[Met Office]] in 1867 and coordinated by Kew Observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=June 2016|title=Sir Francis Ronalds and the Early Years of the Kew Observatory|url=|journal=Weather|doi=10.1002/wea.2739|pmid=|access-date=|bibcode=2016Wthr...71..131R}}&lt;/ref&gt;    These instruments then saw extended use around the world.

An alternative thermograph configuration has a pen that records temperature on a revolving cylinder. The pen is at the end of a lever that is controlled by a bi-metal strip of temperature-sensitive metal which bends as the temperature changes.  A human hair bundle can be used for humidity in such machines.

'''Tomb of Ferdowsi''' ({{lang-fa|آرامگاه فردوسی}}) is a tomb complex composed of a white marble base, and a decorative edifice erected in honor of the [[Persian language|Persian]] poet [[Ferdowsi]] located in [[Tus, Iran]], in [[Razavi Khorasan province]]. It was built in the early 1930s,&lt;ref name=r&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ferdowsi-iii |title=Ferdowsi, Abul-qasem. Mausoleum|last=A.

The construction of the mausoleum as well as its aesthetic design is a reflection of the cultural, and geo-political status of [[Iran]] at the time.

==Background==
[[Ferdowsi]], the influential [[Persian language|Persian]] poet and author of the Persian epic, [[Shahnameh]] died in 1020{{nbsp}}AD in the [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], [[Iran]] (Persia), in the same city in which he was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Poetics and Politics of Iran's National Epic, the Shahnameh |author=Mahmoud Omidsalar|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|date=Nov 2011|pages=52–3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQrIAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+died+at&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VpEzU5aiBYfx0gG694GQDw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20died%20at&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; For all his literary contribution, Ferdowsi was not recognized during his life. It was only after his death that his poems won him admiration. For hundreds of years, his resting place was nothing more than a minor dome-shrine erected by a [[Ghaznavid]] ruler of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], without any permanent edifice in place in the garden of his house where Ferdowsi's daughter had originally buried him.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; In the beginning years of the 20th{{nbsp}}century [[Iran]] started to realize his critical role in defining the [[National symbols of Iran|identity of Iran]].&lt;ref name=s2&gt;{{cite book|title=A Persian Odyssey: Iran Revisited|author=Rami Yelda|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Kbj21wrwwEC&amp;pg=PT168&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+tomb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vZUzU6_QHKixsQTfmIGgCA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20tomb&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ferdosi Tomb2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|One façade of the poet's mausoleum]]
It was not until 1934 that the Iranian government, then under the control of [[Reza Shah]], first king of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], recognized the cultural and literary value of Ferdowsi and erected a permanent tomb in his honor.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; A [[Ferdowsi Millennial Celebration|millennial celebration]] was also held for the poet, to which were invited scholars from several countries, including [[Soviet Tajikistan]], [[India]], [[Armenia]], and [[Europe]] ([[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[France]], [[U.K.|England]]). Funds were collected, mainly donations from [[Parsi]] scholars, to enable the building of a [[statue]] for the poet at his tomb site.{{clarification needed|date=June 2015}} The Pahlavi family used Ferdowsi to advance Iran's cultural prestige, but in doing so nearly cost Ferdowsi his tomb since, after the [[Islamic revolution]], frustrations with the [[Shah of Iran]] nearly led to destruction of the tomb by the revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drinking Arak Off a [cleric]'s Beard: A Journey Through the Inside-Out Worlds of Iran and Afghanistan|author=Nicholas Jubber|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2010|pages=61–2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DblrRc7mCmsC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=islamic+revolution+ferdowsi+tomb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=H6UzU4jTDJOqsQSIy4CwCQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=islamic%20revolution%20ferdowsi%20tomb&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ferdowsi tomb1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Panorama of Ferdowsi's tomb, [[Tus, Iran]]]]
The tomb was originally designed by the Iranian [[architect]], [[Haj Hossein Lurzadeh]] who aside from Ferdowsi's tomb also created some 842 [[mosque]]s, as well as the private palace of Ramsar, part of the decoration of the Marmar palace, the Imam Hossein Mosque in [[Tehran]], the Motahari Mosque, and various parts of the Hazrat-i-Seyyed-o-Shouhada [[Imam Husayn Shrine|shrine]] in [[Karbala]], [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=s4&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Iran: The History of Iranian Art|author=Habibollah Ayatollahi|publisher=Alhoda UK|year=2003|pages=291–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Al0jpyRDGe8C&amp;pg=PA291&amp;dq=Haj+Hossein+Lurzadeh+ferdowsi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AqgzU6qeBubUsAS0mYCYBg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Haj%20Hossein%20Lurzadeh%20ferdowsi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present design of the structure is credited mainly to [[Karim Taherzadeh]], who replaced the old dome-shaped design by Lurzadeh with a modern cubical design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nationalizing Iran: culture, power, and the state, 1870–1940|author=Afshin Marashi|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2011|pages=126–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=488CSG25AzcC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=tomb+of+ferdowsi+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hr40U4e1AvK-sQSbwIKwBA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tomb%20of%20ferdowsi%20architecture&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferdowsi's tomb, which resembles the [[tomb of Cyrus the Great]], is built in style of [[Achaemenid architecture]]. There is a clear link between this choice of architectural style and the politics of Iran at the time. Four years before Reza Shah came to power in 1922, a group of secular Iranian reformists had created the "[[Society for the National Heritage of Iran|Society for National Heritage]]" (SNH, or in Persian ''anjoman-e asar-e meli'').&lt;ref name=s3&gt;{{cite book|title=Culture and Cultural Politics Under Reza Shah: The Pahlavi State, New Bourgeoisie and the Creation of a Modern Society in Iran|author=Bianca Devos, Christoph Werner|publisher=Routledge|date=Aug 22, 2013|pages=101–3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SWAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=architectural+element+of+tomb+of+ferdowsi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jqszU72vJqixsQTfmIGgCA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=architectural%20element%20of%20tomb%20of%20ferdowsi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composed mostly of western-educated, pro-reform intellectuals such as [[Abdolhossein Teymourtash]], [[Hassan Pirnia]], [[Mostowfi ol-Mamalek]], [[Mohammad Ali Foroughi]], Firuz Mirza Firus Nosrat al-Dowleh, and [[Keikhosrow Shahrokh]], the SNH was critical in obtaining the funds from the Iranian parliament.&lt;ref name=s3/&gt; Keikhosrow Shahrokh, Iran's [[Zoroastrian]] representative to the Iranian parliament, was particularly active in reviving Achaemenid and [[Sassanid architecture]] in Iran in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=s3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Architectural Conservation|author=Jukka Jokilehto|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|section=9.1.5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UandAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT505&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+tomb+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ar4zU8P-MdHMsQSyx4GoBA&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20tomb%20architecture&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural Details==

The basic structure of the tomb is rectangular with a large garden surrounding the structure and interacting with the structure in the [[Persian gardens|Persian style of gardening]] known as [[Charbagh|Char-bagh]] (or Chaharbagh translating to ''four gardens'' in Persian). In the center of the cross created by the legs of the garden surrounding it, is an edifice made of primarily white [[marble]]. The edifice can be divided into a "wide chamber" that lies at the base and a cubical erection on top, with four pillars surrounding it and scenes from the epic of Shahnameh and text ornating it. The body of the poet is actually interred in the center of the rectangular wide chamber underneath the overlying four [[Column|pillars]] cube.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; There are twelve (12) steps leading from the lowest point of the wide chamber all the way to the level of the cube. The wide base has a total height of 16 m. The edifice has equal dimensions of 30 m on each side.

The following are schematic diagrams of the aerial view of the tomb's wide base and edifice section and their topography:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

A unique feature of the design of Ferdowsi's tomb has been its resemblance to that of Cyrus the Great in [[Pasargadae]]. Cyrus's tomb also has a rectangular structure seating atop a rectangular, gradually elevating base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis restored: an essay on ancient Assyrian and Persian architecture, Volume 5|author=James Fergusson|publisher=J. Murray|year=1851|pages=214–216 &amp; 206–209 (Zoroaster Cube: pp. 206) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Us0TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=tomb+of+cyrus+dimensions&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RVo7TZf-HYGBlAeEioXrBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tomb%20of%20cyrus%20dimensions&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resemblance is intentional as the designer of this edifice intended to revoke the original Achaemenid style of architecture. In fact every other facet of the edifice has a Zoroastrian symbol known as [[Faravahar]]. This is not coincidental. There are multiple applications of this in the [[Achaemenid architecture]] mainly in [[Persepolis]] in [[Fars province]] today. The "Society for National Heritage of Iran" (SNH) heavily relied on the use of Faravahar as this was the symbolic representation of [[ancient Iran]] since Achaemenid times.&lt;ref name=s4/&gt;&lt;ref name=s3/&gt; Many construction in the 1930s, including the then [[National Bank of Iran]] use Faravahar which is not unexpected considering that the same architect that created Ferdowsi's tomb also created the National Bank of Iran.&lt;ref name=s4/&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

A closer look at the edifice points out that there are four columns each at the corner of the rectangular structure with two half-buried columns that protrude as deep [[friezes]] on each facet of the structure. Each frieze column has a box, followed by a two horn bull sign which is very much similar if not the exact imitation of the Persepolis column design. The columns are ornated with [[Fluting (architecture)|fluting]] 3/4 of the way down with the last portion spared. The overall effect is intended to create a grand gesture. The columns are as high as the edifice which is 30 meters high. (the edifice is also 30 m wide).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.where-is-iran.com/Historical-Monument-In-Iran/Tombs-Khorassan-Razavi-Iran.aspx |title=Ferdowsi Tomb, Toos-Khorasan-Iran |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= |website= Where is Iran |publisher= |accessdate=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marble decorations are used to ornate the siding and the floor of the "wide base" structure as well the wall. Persian flower designs (concentric flower designs composed of a flower with seven (7) ovaloid pellets surrounding a central circle), and hexagonal marble designs are commonly used in the structure.

==Historical Context==
[[File:Rpferdosi.jpg|thumb|right|Reza Shah Pahlavi officially opening the mausoleum of Ferdowsi for public visiting upon conclusion of Ferdowi Millenary conference]]
[[Iran]]'s history has been closely tied to geopolitical changes that has taken place since the establishment of the [[Achaemenid empire]] in [[Persis]] all the way to the modern day Iran. Two major events are of critical importance in Iran's history specially its literary history as it pertained to Ferdowsi: [[Arab conquest of Persia]] and the [[Mongolia]]n invasion of Persia.

Ferdowsi lived his life as a poor man constantly moving from court to court, and eventually died a poor widower, having lost his only son.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], at one point was an opulent city in the [[greater Khorasan]] region but it was repeatedly sacked by [[Oguz Turks]], [[Mongols]], and [[Uzbeks]] from the steppe.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; This and the growing influence of [[Mashad]] as a political and religious center within Khorasan shaped Ferdowsi's experience and in many way influenced his writing as Tus lost prestige. Additionally, Arabic had found prestige in lands conquered by the Arabs and there was threat of [[Middle Persian]] being lost in favor of [[Arabic]]. Ferdowsi's role is critical in that using the least number of loan-words he transferred the [[Middle Persian]] (Pahlavi) into Modern [[Persian language|Persian]] (Farsi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Iran: Empire of the Mind|first=Michael |last=Axworthy|authorlink=Michael Axworthy|publisher=Basic Books|pages=66–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGl_Gu6BwxYC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+arabic+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rAY0U9_5Iu_JsQT-p4GoBg&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20arabic%20language&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the time frame preceding the construction of the mausoleum, nationalistic feelings in Iran were high.&lt;ref name=t&gt;{{cite book|title=The Soul of Iran: A Nation's Struggle for Freedom|author=Afshin Molavi|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2010|pages=40–50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Za59PAytkFwC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=reza+shah+ferdowsi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pBQ0U9LJHNHmsAST3ILoCQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=reza%20shah%20ferdowsi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a renewed sense of national identity partly due to the pressures felt by foreign powers including the constant Anglo-Persian political struggle specially over the issues of oil, and partly due to inability of the [[Qajar]] dynasty from protecting Iranian lands in central Asia to the Russians and in the east to the British. [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] (AIOC) was an important source of contention for Iranians. One journalist studying during this time period reflects his and his colleagues personal experience:

{{quote|We supported Reza Shah, and we wanted to support his effort to create a modern nation state, to lift us from our backwardness. At this time we talked about Pan-Iraniasm, or reuniting Afghanistan with Iran. We also talked of nationalism. Ferdowsi became very popular partly because of Reza Shah's support for him, and also partly because of the nationalistic impulses the shahnameh inspired.&lt;ref name=t/&gt;}}

The architecture of Ferdowsi's tomb is also influenced by poet's own personal life, reflecting a constant struggle between the poor poet and the lazy king, and adversity and hope. The Society for National Heritage in 1930s drawing on poet's attempt to revitalize the Persian language, also attempted to revitalize Persian culture and Iranian identity through architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Power of Iranian Narratives: A Thousand Years of Healing|author=Laleh Shahideh|publisher=University Press of America|year=2004|pages=125–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHjArCjZ27sC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+Iranian+identity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-Qw0U8K4CZDjsATc4oGgBw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20Iranian%20identity&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in many ways taken literary with Persian poems from Shahnameh etched into the white marble facets of the edifice of the poet's mausoleum.

After the Iranian revolution, both tomb of Ferdowsi and even mausoleum of Cyrus the Great survived the initial chaos. One of the most dangerous threats to the structure was that it would be equated with the late Pahlavi dynasty by the new regime and destroyed. It however was not and was instead embraced by the new local government since Ferdowsi was a devout Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Persian Pilgrimages: Journeys Across Iran|author=Afshin Molavi|publisher=W.

Norton &amp; Company|pages=69–72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yxd3E-_AqSEC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=ferdowsi+devout+muslim&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a700U5zoMdbJsQTvjIHICg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ferdowsi%20devout%20muslim&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior Design==

[[File:Ferdowsi tomb3.jpg|thumb|right|The tomb of Ferdowsi with the accompanying text. To see the translation, see the text on the left.]]
Ferdowsi's Shahnameh inspires tales of heroic act by [[protagonist]]s fighting against their antagonists. In that sense it is a [[national epic]] that encompasses not only fictional and literary figures but also incorporates parts of the history of pre-Islamic Iran. This has led to the interior of the edifice of Ferdowsi to reflect the same heroic scenes.&lt;ref name=r/&gt; The chief architect responsible for the design of the interior of the tomb of Ferdowsi is [[Feraydoon Sadeghi]] who created deep frieze scenes using three dimensional statues each depicting a scene from Shahnameh. [[Rostam]], the hero of the book of Shahnameh is the focus of the majority of the scenes inside of the edifice. As Shahnameh is essentially a text, artistic recreation of its heroic scenes are multiple.&lt;ref name=r/&gt; Centered inside the edifice surrounding by the frieze scenes and other artistic endeavors is the [[tomb stone]] of the poet. Etched in the tomb stone in Farsi (Persian) is the description of Ferdowsi's contribution to the Persian-speakers and at the end it ends by denoting the poet's date of birth, date of death, and the date at which the mausoleum was built.

The [[Persian language|Persian]] content of the tomb is as follows:

&lt;blockquote lang="fa" style="direction: rtl; unicode-bidi: embed;"&gt;بنام خداوند جان و خرد. این مکان فرخنده آرامگاه استاد گویندگان فارسی‌زبان و سراینده داستان‌های ملی ایران، حکیم ابوالقاسم فردوسی طوسی است که سخنان او زنده‌کننده کشور ایران و در دل مردم این سرزمین جاودان است&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[English language|English]] translation is roughly as follows:

{{quote|In the name of the God who created life. This place is the resting place of he (Hakim Abul-qasem Ferdowsi Tusi) who has advanced the art of language among Persian speakers, and the holder of the national epic of Iran and its national stories. His words have given a new life to Iran, and he has a place in the hearts of its people.}}

==Legacy==

Today Ferdowsi's tomb is one of the most photographed in Iran.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; Millions of visitors from various [[provinces of Iran]] come to see the tomb every year. Foreign dignitaries, tourists, and other Persian-Speaking civilians from [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Middle East]] also visit the site. The most recent was a visit from the Iraqi tourism minister in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.bandarabbas.irna.ir/en/News/80750845/Art_&amp;_Culture/Iraqi_tourism_minister_visits_tomb_of_Ferdowsi|title=Iraqi tourism minister visits tomb of Ferdowsi|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=25 July 2013 |website= IRNA |publisher= IRNA |accessdate=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has also inspired many Persian poets including [[Iran]]ian poet [[Mehdi Akhavan-Sales]] who is actually physically buried not far from the tomb of Ferdowsi, in his own tomb in the grounds of Ferdowsi's complex.

A '''torpedo''' is an explosive device used, especially in the early days of the [[petroleum industry]], to fracture the surrounding rock at the bottom of an [[oil well]] to stimulate the flow of oil and to remove built-up [[paraffin wax]] that would restrict the flow. Earlier torpedoes used [[gunpowder]], but the use of [[nitroglycerin]] eventually became widespread. The development of [[hydraulic fracturing]] rendered torpedoes obsolete,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Francis|first=Don|title=Torpedo tales|url=http://www.epmag.com/archives/oilFieldHistory/145.htm|publisher=''E&amp;P Magazine''|date=December 1, 2006|accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the primary fracturing process used today.

== Use ==
A torpedo consisted of canisters that were filled with an explosive and lowered into a well via a rope or wire. [[Gunpowder]] was used in the first torpedoes, but [[nitroglycerin]] was found to work better despite its instability. The well is usually filled with water to prevent the explosion from escaping upwards. Originally, the topmost canister had a [[percussion cap]] that was to detonate the main charge.&lt;ref name="bacon hamor 333"&gt;Bacon and Hamor, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; An iron weight was dropped down the well to set the torpedo off. After incidents of premature explosions, a second method was developed in which a tube of the explosive was placed in a larger tube that was packed with sand.&lt;ref name="bacon hamor 333"/&gt; A fuse was wound around the inner tube, connected to a [[blasting cap]]. When the torpedo was to be used, the inner tube was filled with nitroglycerin and corked; the fuse was lit and torpedo was dropped down the well.&lt;ref name="bacon hamor 333"/&gt;

Torpedoes were generally used to remove buildup of paraffin wax from an oil well. Before the use of torpedoes caught on, boiling water or [[benzene]] was often poured down wells to try to dissolve the paraffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Michener|first=Carollee|title=Nitroglycerine Saved Many Wells|work=OIL 150|publisher=Oil Region Alliance|location=[[Oil City, Pennsylvania]]|date=April 2007|url=http://www.oil150.com/essays/2007/04/nitroglycerine-saved-many-wells |accessdate=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torpedoes were also used to fracture the rock to allow the oil to flow more easily.

== History ==
[[Edward A. L. Roberts]] developed the first torpedo and submitted a [[patent application]] in November 1864.&lt;ref name="whiteshot 755"&gt;Whiteshot, p. 755&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts, an [[American Civil War]] veteran, came up with the concept of using water to "[[wikt:tamp#Verb|tamp]]" the resulting explosion, after watching [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] artillery rounds explode in a canal at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]].&lt;ref name="whiteshot 755"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wells 8"&gt;Wells, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts developed his first torpedoes in 1865 and 1866. In November 1866 he was granted a [[patent]] on his torpedo application, and founded the Roberts Petroleum Torpedo Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|country=US|number=59936|status=patent|title=Improvement of the method of increasing the capacity of oil-wells|gdate=November 20, 1866|inventor=Roberts, Edward A.L.|invent1=Roberts, Edward A. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Reed also developed a torpedo design and went on to found a rival company "for the purpose of infringing and breaking down the Roberts patent.&lt;ref name="whiteshot 755"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whiteshot 756"&gt;Whiteshot, p. 756&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts charged $100-200 per torpedo as well as a [[royalties|royalty]] amounting to {{Frac|1|15}} of the increased oil production.&lt;ref name="wells 8"/&gt; To avoid paying the exorbitant fees, an owner of a well would often hire men who illegally produced their own torpedoes and used them at night&amp;mdash;the practice giving rise to term "[[wikt:moonlight#Verb|moonlighting]]". Roberts spent $250,000 to protect his patent from the "moonlighters" by hiring the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]] and filing numerous [[lawsuit]]s.&lt;ref name="wells 8"/&gt; Roberts' torpedo patents expired in 1879.&lt;ref name="whiteshot 756"/&gt;

Torpedoes manufactured today use modern explosives, with the last nitroglycerin torpedo being used on May 5, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Undocumented features''' also known using the term '''Feature, not a bug''' are [[software feature]]s that are frequently found in [[software]] releases. Sometimes the [[documentation]] is omitted through simple [[oversight]], but undocumented features are often essential elements of the software that are not intended for use by end users, but left available for use by the vendor for [[help desk|software support]] and development.

Since the suppliers of the software usually consider the [[software documentation]] to constitute a contract for the behavior of the software, undocumented features are generally left unsupported, and may be removed or changed at will and without notice to the users.

== Types == 
Undocumented features (for example, the ability to change the [[Switch (command line)|switch]] character in [[MS-DOS]], usually to a [[hyphen]]) can be included for [[computer compatibility|compatibility]] purposes (in this case with [[Unix]] utilities) or for future-expansion reasons. However; if the software provider changes their software strategy to better align with the business, the absence of documentation makes it easier to justify the feature's removal.

New versions of software might omit mention of old (possibly superseded) features in documentation but keep them implemented for users who've grown accustomed to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arredondo|first=Larry|date=Mar 26, 1984|title=Review: WordStar 3.3|journal=InfoWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While an incorrect use of the term, in some cases [[software bug]]s are referred to -jokingly- as undocumented features. ("''It's not a bug; it's an undocumented feature!''") &lt;ref&gt;Older versions of the [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] [[Jargon File]] [http://www.dourish.com/goodies/jargon.html] define FEATURE as "A surprising property of a program. Occasionally documented."&lt;/ref&gt; This usage may have been popularised in some of Microsoft's responses to bug reports for its first [[Word for Windows]] product,&lt;ref&gt;[[James Gleick]], ''What Just Happened'', ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; but doesn't originate there. The oldest surviving reference on [[Usenet]] dates to 5 March 1984.&lt;ref name="FirstUse"&gt;[http://groups.google.com/group/net.bugs.uucp/msg/4cf617f8eb9482da?hl=en&amp;dmode=source First Use on Usenet]. Google Groups&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1969 and 1972, Sandy Mathes, a systems programmer for [[PDP-8]] software at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) in Maynard, MA, used the terms "bug" and "feature" in her reporting of test results to distinguish between undocumented actions of delivered software products that were ''unacceptable'' and ''tolerable'', respectively. This usage may have been perpetuated.&lt;ref&gt;Memories of Sandy Mathes, now Sandra Lee Harris, [[MIT]] Class of 1969, as of August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exceptions == 
Ironically, undocumented features themselves have become a major feature of [[computer games]]. Developers often include various [[cheat code|cheats]] and other special features ("[[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]]") that are not explained in the packaged material, but have become part of the "buzz" about the game on the [[Internet]] and among gamers. The undocumented features of foreign games are often elements that were not [[language localization|localized]] from their native language.

[[Closed source]] [[application programming interface|APIs]] can also have undocumented functions that are not generally known. These are sometimes used to gain a commercial advantage over third-party software by providing additional information or better performance to the application provider.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5836">'''Vehicle regulations''' are requirements that automobiles must satisfy in order to be approved for sale or use in a particular country or region. They are usually mandated by legislation, and administered by a government body. The regulations concern aspects such as lighting, controls, [[crashworthiness]], environment protection and theft protection.

==List of regulations==
*International
**[[Europe]]: ECE ([[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]]), [[European Union|EU]] EG‐Directive
**[[United Nations|UN]]: GTR ([[World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations|Global Technical Regulations]])
*National
**United States: [[FMVSS]] (administered by the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA), which also administers the [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) standard)
**Canada: [[CMVSS]]
**China: [[Guobiao standards]]
**[[South Korea]]: [[KMVSS]]
**Australia: ADR ([[Australian Design Rules]])
**Japan: Test Requirements and Instructions for Automobile Standards
**India: AIS ([[Automotive Industry Standards]]), IS ([[Indian Standards]])
*Provincial/State
** California state, United States: CARB ([[California Air Resources Board]])

==Internationally harmonised regulations==
The first steps toward harmonising vehicle regulations internationally were made in 1952 when WP.29, a working party of experts on technical requirements of vehicles was created. This resulted in the 1958 Agreement on uniform conditions of approval and mutual recognition of approvals of vehicles, components and parts. There was a new agreement in 1998 whose objectives were to improve global safety, decrease environmental pollution and consumption of energy and improve anti‐theft performance of vehicles and related components and equipment through establishing global technical regulations (GTRs) in a Global Registry based on UNECE Regulations or on national regulations listed in a Compendium of candidates, GTR harmonising them at the highest level. In 2000, WP.29 became the [[World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations]] that is a working party of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe(UNECE).

The '''von Karman Gas Dynamics Facility''' at [[Arnold Engineering Development Complex]], [[Arnold Air Force Base]], Tennessee, provide aerothermal ground test simulations of hypersonic flight over a wide range of velocities and pressure altitudes. The facility consists of three [[Hypersonic wind tunnel]]s:  Tunnel A, B, and C. The wind tunnels can be run for several hours at a time thanks to a 92,500 horsepower air compressor plant system.&lt;ref name="af"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arnold.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=12974|title=Factsheets : THE VON KARMAN GAS DYNAMICS FACILITY WIND TUNNELS|publisher=arnold.af.mil|accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The test unit is owned by the [[United States Air Force]] and operated by [http://nas-llc.us/ National Aerospace Solutions].

== Tunnel A ==
Tunnel A is a 48-inch squared, continuous, closed-circuit, variable density, supersonic wind tunnel with a Mach number range of 1.5 to 5.5 with a maximum temperature of 290 degrees Fahrenheit. Devoted primarily to explorations of aerodynamic design, Tunnel A's unique feature is its computer controlled continuous-curvature nozzle that can vary the tunnel's Mach number.

== Tunnel B ==
Tunnel B is a 50-inch, closed-circuit hypersonic tunnel with continuous-flow capability with a Mach number capability of 6 and 8. Provided with air heated to a maximum of 900&amp;nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit with natural gas-fired heaters. Tunnel B is also primarily explores aerodynamic design.

== Tunnel C ==
Tunnel C is a continuous-flow tunnel with a Mach number capability of 4, 6, and 10. It offers an aerothermal environment for testing materials proposed for use on space vehicles and aircraft. The one-of-a-kind wind tunnel makes it possible to subject flight hardware to a combination aerodynamic and thermodynamic—or heating—effects up to 1,440&amp;nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit so engineers can study how aerospace vehicles and material response to the combined effects of external heating, internal heat conduction and pressure loading.

'''Wilkinson Sword''' is a [[brand]] owned by [[Edgewell Personal Care]] for [[Safety razor|razors]] and other [[personal care]] products sold in Europe.  It was founded as a company in [[London]] in 1772 by [[Henry Nock]] as a manufacturer of guns, made in [[Shotley Bridge]] in [[County Durham]].

Besides swords, the company has also produced guns, bayonets and products such as [[typewriter]]s, garden [[Pruning shears|shears]], [[scissors]] and [[motorcycle]]s.&lt;ref name="WS"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Wilkinson-Sword-Ltd-Company-History.html| title=Wilkinson Sword Ltd. History |accessdate=8 March 2013| publisher=Funding Universe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardening equipment is still made under the Wilkinson Sword name by E.P. Barrus under a licensing arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.wilkinsonsword-tools.co.uk/about-us|publisher=E.P. Barrus Ltd.|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkinson Sword has manufactured its products in three UK locations over the years: in London, ([[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] and [[Acton, London|Acton]]), [[Cramlington]] in [[Northumberland]] and [[Bridgend]] in Wales, where it made gardening tools. In 2000, the company closed its razor plant in the UK and consolidated production in Germany.

==History==
{{recentism|section|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Nock volley gun.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Nock gun|Nock Volley Gun]] (1779-1780)]]
[[Henry Nock]] began trading as a gunlock smith out of Mount Pleasant in London in 1772.  In 1775, he formed '''Nock, Jover &amp; Co.''' with William Jover and John Green.&lt;ref name=Wainwright&gt;{{cite journal|first=Peter S.|last=Wainwright|title=Henry Nock, Innovator 1741–1804|journal=The American Society of Arms Collectors Bulletin|number=88|pages=1–20|url=http://americansocietyofarmscollectors.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Henry-Nock-gunmaker-1741-to-1804-B088_Wainwright.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[American Revolutionary War]] led to strong sales for the new company.  In 1776, the [[Board of Ordnance]] granted Nock, Jover &amp; Co. an advance of £200 to start producing [[bayonet]]s and in 1779 the company won a contract to produce 500 seven-barreled volley guns for the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=Wainwright /&gt;  Although designed by James Wilson, these would become known as Nock Volley Guns or [[Nock gun]]s.&lt;ref name=Wainwright /&gt;

When Henry Nock died in 1804, he left the company to his foreman and adopted son-in-law, James Wilkinson.&lt;ref name=Wainwright /&gt;  When James' son Henry Wilkinson joined the company it was renamed '''James Wilkinson &amp; Son''' (also known as simply '''Wilkinson &amp; Son''').&lt;ref name=Wainwright /&gt;  It became the '''Wilkinson Sword Company''' in 1891.

===Motorcycle production===
[[File:Wilkinson 850cc.jpg|thumb|Wilkinson TMC 850cc]]
Wilkinson Sword produced some of the earliest motorcycles in 1903.  These were two-cylinder machines with Belgian engines made by [[Antoine (automobile)|Antoine]], which were marketed by a garage in [[Chelsea, London]] – one of the first motorcycle dealerships in the UK.  The venture was not a success however.&lt;ref name="Mirco"&gt;{{cite book|last=De Cet|first=Mirco|title=The Complete Encyclopedia of Classic Motorcycles|editor=Quentin Daniel|publisher=Rebo International|year=2005|isbn=978-90-366-1497-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, Wilkinson developed and manufactured the [[Wilkinson TMC]], a luxury touring [[motorcycle]] between 1911 and 1916, when production was stopped by World War I.&lt;ref name="Currieover"&gt;{{cite book|last=Currie|first=Bob|title=Classic British Motorcycles of over 500cc|publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd|year=1988|isbn=1-85260-083-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first 'Wilkinsons' were designed for military reconnaissance by P G Tacchi, who was granted a patent for the design in 1908.{{citation needed|date=November 2012|reason=No source cited yet}} Demonstrated to the British military in the summer of 1908, the Wilkinson motorcycle failed to impress the authorities, despite optional accessories including a sidecar complete with [[Maxim machine gun]] – and a steering wheel instead of handlebars.&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;{{cite book| last=Brooks| first=John| title=The National Motorcycle Museum| publisher=Jarrold Publishing| year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Undaunted, the company continued development and exhibited a new version a year later at the Stanley Clyde Motorcycle Show at the Agricultural Hall, [[Islington]], London in 1909.&lt;ref name="progress"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=P19100301.2.9.3&amp;l=mi&amp;e=-------10--1----0-all| title=Stanley Clyde Show| work=Progress: Vol V, Issue 5| date=1 March 1910| accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only about 250&amp;nbsp;Wilkinsons were produced before World War I. Restrictions brought the line to its end in spring 1916, and Wilkinson had to produce thousands of bayonets for the war effort. After the war, they decided to continue to develop the in-line four engine&amp;nbsp;– but in a new car called the Deemster, and they never resumed motorcycle production.&lt;ref name="Currieover" /&gt;

===Stainless steel razor blades===
In 1962, Wilkinson Sword introduced [[stainless steel]] razor blades and soon the company's blades made rapid gains in shares of the market, because one blade, though somewhat more expensive, could be used for a week.  The earlier carbon steel razor blades rusted quickly enough that many people used a new blade each day.  So, although Wilkinson gained a larger percentage of the market, the demand for razor blades declined to approximately 14 percent of its previous level.  This introduction gave Wilkinson a substantive market share and previous market leaders quickly responded by introducing their own stainless blades.  The technology had been available for some time, but the market leaders such as Gillette, which held a patent on stainless blades, presumably knew that any gain for them in market share would be overwhelmed by the dramatic reduction in the size of the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,829515,00.html | work=Time | title=Competition: Beastly Blades | date=23 November 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merger with British Match===
In 1973, Wilkinson Sword merged with [[Bryant and May|the British Match Corporation]] to form '''Wilkinson Match'''.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt;  This was intended to create a stronger company, with a larger [[advertising]] budget that would enable the company to fight its [[United States|American]] rival in the [[consumer]] [[shaving]] market, [[Gillette (brand)|the Gillette Company]], and its British subsidiary, also called Gillette. In this advertising war, Wilkinson Sword loudly touted its long and proud tradition of bladesmithing in its print and electronic media advertisements.  That same year Wilkinson purchased the American pen and lighter company [[Scripto|Scripto, Inc.]] in an attempt to diversify its holdings.&lt;ref name ="WS"/&gt;

[[Allegheny Ludlum|Allegheny Ludlum Industries]] of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] purchased Wilkinson Match in 1978.  After becoming Allegheny International, Inc., the company filed for [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] reorganization in 1987.  Allegheny sold Wilkinson Match in 1986 to [[Swedish Match]], which merged with Stora Group two years later.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt;  In 1989, Gillette helped finance a buyout of the Swedish Match consumer products division, which included Wilkinson Sword, by the Netherlands-based Eemland Holdings, giving Gillette a 22% stake in Eemland.&lt;ref name="gillette"&gt;{{cite news| title=Gillette ordered to sell stake in Wilkinson parent| url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1992/Gillette-Ordered-to-Sell-Stake-in-Wilkinson-Parent/id-de9aa88727fa96804d6abc8ded7204a0| last=Yenkin| first=Jonathan| date=11 November 1992| agency=[[Associated Press]]| publisher=APnewsarchive| accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Gillette was ordered by the European Community Commission in 1992 to sell its interest in Eemland, Eemland sold Wilkinson Sword to [[Warner-Lambert]], owner of [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] razor brand forming Schick-Wilkinson Sword.  The Schick name was used on its products in North America and Japan, and the Wilkinson Sword name in Europe.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt; In 2000, [[Pfizer]] acquired Warner-Lambert and three-years later, divested the Wilkinson component.

Most of the former [[Bryant and May]] operations of Wilkinson Match were closed or sold in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including the Bryant and May factories in [[Bow Quarter|Bow]] and [[Bryant and May Factory, Melbourne|Melbourne]]. The gardening tools division was sold to [[Fiskars]] in the 1990s.

During this time, Wilkinson Sword produced ceremonial swords for the [[Household Cavalry]] of the [[British Army]], and crafted the ceremonial sword for the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II]] in 2002. The sword factory combined state of the art manufacturing technology with traditional skills and 19th century machinery to produce original fighting quality swords.

The production of swords came to an end when the company's sword factory at Acton closed in September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Army sword factory gets the chop|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4263618.stm|accessdate=25 January 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=20 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkinson Sword then held an auction of the tools, equipment, sword drawings, and forging and milling machinery. Robert Pooley, who had commissioned the company to produce swords, bought many of these items and formed [[Pooley Sword]] to supply the Army in place of Wilkinson Sword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Military Swords|url=http://pooleysword.com/|publisher=Pooley Sword|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sword manufacturers, and in particular WKC in Germany, also bought items, including the roll forge. Many of the tools and machines are still in use today and classic knives such as the [[Fairbairn-Sykes]] are produced by the company.

===21st century===
[[Energizer|Energizer Holdings]] bought Wilkinson Sword from [[Pfizer]] in 2003, along with [[Schick (razors)|Schick]]. In 2015, Energizer demerged its personal care business as a new company, [[Edgewell Personal Care]], of which Wilkinson Sword and Schick became part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/agoodman/2015/06/25/with-the-energizer-split-what-will-edgewell-look-like/|title=With The Energizer Split, What Will Edgewell Look Like?|author=Andrew Goodman|work=Forbes|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are now brands used by Edgewell; Wilkinson Sword is used in Europe and Schick is used in Edgewell's remaining markets.

Wilkinson Sword-branded three-, four-, and five-bladed razors for men and women have been produced in Germany since 1998, when production moved from the UK.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| title=Wilkinson Sword cuts jobs| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/business/the_company_file/184274.stm| publisher=BBC News| date=1 October 1998| accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
