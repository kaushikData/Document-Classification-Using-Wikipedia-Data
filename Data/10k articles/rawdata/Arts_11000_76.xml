'''Abstract art''' uses a [[visual language]] of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph Arnheim, ''Visual Thinking'', University of California Press, 1969, {{ISBN|0520018710}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western art]] had been, from the [[Renaissance]] up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the [[19th century]] many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in [[technology]], [[science]] and [[philosophy]]. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gooding, ''Abstract Art'', [[Tate Publishing Ltd|Tate Publishing]], London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstract art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and non-representational art are loosely related terms. They are similar, but perhaps not of identical meaning.

Abstraction indicates a departure from reality in depiction of [[image]]ry in art. This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. Abstraction exists along a continuum. Even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is likely to be exceedingly elusive. Artwork which takes liberties, altering for instance color and form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially abstract. Total abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. In [[geometric abstraction]], for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. [[Figurative art]] and total abstraction are almost [[Mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]]. But figurative and [[Representation (arts)|representational]] (or [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]]) art often contains partial abstraction.

Both geometric abstraction and [[lyrical abstraction]] are often totally abstract. Among the very numerous [[art movements]] that embody partial abstraction would be for instance [[fauvism]] in which color is conspicuously and deliberately altered vis-a-vis reality, and [[cubism]], which blatantly alters the forms of the real life entities depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://painting.about.com/od/abstractart/a/abstract_art.htm |title=Abstract Art – What Is Abstract Art or Abstract Painting, retrieved January 7, 2009 |publisher=Painting.about.com |date=2011-06-07 |accessdate=2011-06-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707075052/http://painting.about.com/od/abstractart/a/abstract_art.htm| archivedate= 7 July 2011 &lt;!-- DASHBot --&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm |title=Themes in American Art – Abstraction, retrieved January 7, 2009 |publisher=Nga.gov |date=2000-07-27 |accessdate=2011-06-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608093226/http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm |archivedate=8 June 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|History of painting|Western painting}}

== Abstraction in early art and many cultures ==
{{Main article|Prehistoric art|Eastern art history}}

Much of the art of earlier cultures – signs and marks on pottery, textiles, and inscriptions and paintings on rock – used simple, geometric and linear forms which might have had a symbolic or decorative purpose.&lt;ref&gt;György Kepes, ''Sign, Image and Symbol'', [[Studio Vista]], London, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; It is at this level of visual meaning that abstract art communicates.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Hyatt,"Meeting on the Moor", ''[[Modern Painters]]'', Autumn 1995&lt;/ref&gt; One can enjoy the beauty of [[Chinese calligraphy]] or [[Islamic calligraphy]] without being able to read it.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Leys, 2013.

New York: ''New York Review Books''. p. 304. {{ISBN|9781590176207}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Immortal in Splashed Ink.jpg|thumb|left|''Immortal in splashed ink'', Liang Kai, China, 12th century]]
In Chinese painting, abstraction can be traced to the [[Tang dynasty]] painter Wang Mo (王墨), who is credited to have invented the splashed-ink painting style.&lt;ref&gt;Lippit, Y. (2012). "Of Modes and Manners in Japanese Ink Painting: Sesshū's Splashed Ink Landscape of 1495". ''The Art Bulletin'', 94(1), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; While none of his paintings remain, this style is clearly seen in some [[Song Dynasty]] Paintings. The [[Chan Buddhism|Chan buddhist]] painter Liang Kai (梁楷, c. 1140–1210) applied the style to figure painting in his "Immortal in splashed ink"  in which accurate representation is sacrificed to enhance spontaneity linked to the non-rational mind of the enlightened. A late Song painter named Yu Jian, adept to [[Tiantai|Tiantai buddhism]], created a series of splashed ink landscapes that eventually inspired many Japanese zen painters. His paintings show heavily misty mountains in which the shapes of the objects are barely visible and extremely simplified. This type of painting was continued by [[Sesshu Toyo]] in his later years.
[[File:Yujian ink Mercadodemontaña.jpg|thumb|right|''Mountain market, clearing Mist'', Yu Jian, China]]
Another instance of abstraction in Chinese painting is seen in Zhu Derun's [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Zhu_Derun_-_Primordial_Chaos_(painting_only).jpeg ''Cosmic Circle'']. On the left side of this painting is a pine tree in rocky soil, its branches laced with vines that extend in a disorderly manner to the right side of the painting in which a perfect circle (probably made with help of a compass&lt;ref&gt;Watt, J. C. (2010). ''The World of Khubilai Khan: Chinese Art in the Yuan Dynasty''. Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;) floats in the void. The painting is a reflection of the [[Daoism|Daoist]] metaphysics in which chaos and reality are complementary stages of the regular course of nature.
In Tokugawa Japan some zen monk-painters created [[Enso]], a circle who represents the absolute enlightenment. Usually made in one spontaneous brush stroke, it became the paradigm of the minimalist aesthetic that guided part of the zen painting.

Patronage from the church diminished and private patronage from the public became more capable of providing a livelihood for artists.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich, "The Early Medici as Patrons of Art" in ''[[Norm and Form]]'', pp. 35–57, London, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Balfe, ed. ''Paying the Piper: Causes and Consequences of Art Patronage'', Univ. of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[art movement]]s which contributed to the development of abstract art were [[Romanticism]], [[Impressionism]] and [[Expressionism]]. Artistic independence for artists was advanced during the 19th century. An ''objective interest in what is seen'', can be discerned from the paintings of [[John Constable]], [[J M W Turner]], [[Camille Corot]] and from them to the Impressionists who continued the ''[[plein air]]'' painting of the [[Barbizon school]].

A near abstraction, in 1877 Whistler sued the art critic [[John Ruskin]] for libel after the critic condemned this painting. Ruskin accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.princeton.edu/wri152-3/rpower/archives/001951.html Whistler versus Ruskin, Princeton edu.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616062046/http://blogs.princeton.edu/wri152-3/rpower/archives/001951.html |date=June 16, 2010 }} Retrieved June 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/turnerwhistlermonet/wvr.htm From the Tate], retrieved April 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Early intimations of a new art had been made by [[James McNeill Whistler]] who, in his painting ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold: The falling Rocket]]'', (1872), placed greater emphasis on visual sensation than the depiction of objects.

[[Expressionism|Expressionist]] painters explored the bold use of paint surface, drawing distortions and exaggerations, and intense color. Expressionists produced emotionally charged paintings that were reactions to and perceptions of contemporary experience; and reactions to [[Impressionism]] and other more conservative directions of late 19th-century painting. The Expressionists drastically changed the emphasis on subject matter in favor of the portrayal of psychological states of being. Although artists like [[Edvard Munch]] and [[James Ensor]] drew influences principally from the work of the [[Post-Impressionists]] they were instrumental to the advent of abstraction in the 20th century.
[[Paul Cézanne]] had begun as an Impressionist but his aim – to make a logical construction of reality based on a view from a single point,&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Read, ''A Concise History of Modern Art'', Thames and Hudson&lt;/ref&gt; with modulated color in flat areas – became the basis of a new visual art, later to be developed into [[Cubism]] by [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]].

[[File:Yellow Curtain.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Le rideau jaune|The Yellow Curtain]]'', 1915. With his [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] color and drawing Matisse comes very close to pure abstraction.]] Additionally in the late 19th century in Eastern Europe [[mysticism]] and early [[Modernism|modernist]] religious philosophy as expressed by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Helena Blavatsky|Mme. Blavatsky]] had a profound impact on pioneer [[Geometric abstraction|geometric]] artists like [[Hilma af Klint]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. The mystical teaching of [[Georges Gurdjieff]] and [[P.D. Ouspensky]] also had an important influence on the early formations of the geometric abstract styles of [[Piet Mondrian]] and his colleagues in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Mondrian---mysticism---ldquo-My-long-search-is-over-rdquo--4237 |title=Hilton Kramer, "Mondrian &amp; mysticism: My long search is over", ''New Criterion'', September 1995 |publisher=Newcriterion.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 20th century ==
{{main article|Western painting|Fauvism|Cubism|}}

[[Post Impressionism]] as practiced by [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Paul Cézanne]] had an enormous impact on [[20th-century art]] and led to the advent of 20th-century abstraction. The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of [[modern art]]. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. With his expressive use of color and his free and imaginative drawing Henri Matisse comes very close to pure abstraction in ''French Window at Collioure'' (1914), ''[[View of Notre-Dame]]'' (1914), and ''[[Le rideau jaune|The Yellow Curtain]]'' from 1915. The raw language of color as developed by the [[Fauvism|Fauves]] directly influenced another pioneer of abstraction, [[Wassily Kandinsky]].

Although [[Cubism]] ultimately depends upon subject matter, it became, along with [[Fauvism]], the art movement that directly opened the door to abstraction in the 20th century. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907), Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[Analytic cubism]] was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], practiced by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and others into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter. The collage artists like [[Kurt Schwitters]] and [[Man Ray]] and others taking the clue from [[Cubism]] were instrumental to the development of the movement called [[Dada]].

The Italian poet [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] published the [[Manifesto of Futurism]] in 1909, which later inspired artists such as [[Carlo Carra]] in ''Painting of Sounds, Noises and Smells'' and [[Umberto Boccioni]] ''Train in Motion'', 1911, to a further stage of abstraction that would, along with [[Cubism]], profoundly influenced art movements throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Tisdall and Angelo Bozzolla, ''Futurism'', Thames and Hudson, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1912 Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], where [[František Kupka]] exhibited the abstract painting ''Amorpha, Fugue en deux couleurs'' (''Fugue in Two Colors'') (1912), the poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] named the work of several artists including [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Section d'or, 1912–1920–1925'', Cécile Debray, Françoise Lucbert, Musées de Châteauroux, Musée Fabre, exhibition catalogue, Éditions Cercle d'art, Paris, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He defined it as, "the art of painting new structures out of elements that have not been borrowed from the visual sphere, but had been created entirely by the artist...it is a pure art."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison and Wood, ''Art in theory, 1900–2000'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2003, p. 189. {{ISBN|978-0631227083}}.[https://books.google.com/books?id=SWu4SB92fHMC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Apollinaire+on+Art books.google.com"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the turn of the century, cultural connections between artists of the major European cities had become extremely active as they strove to create an art form equal to the high aspirations of [[modernism]]. Ideas were able to cross-fertilize by means of artist's books, exhibitions and [[art manifesto|manifestos]] so that many sources were open to experimentation and discussion, and formed a basis for a diversity of modes of abstraction. The following extract from ''The World Backwards'' gives some impression of the inter-connectedness of culture at the time: "[[David Burliuk]]'s knowledge of modern art movements must have been extremely up-to-date, for the second [[Russian avant-garde|Knave of Diamonds exhibition]], held in January 1912 (in Moscow) included not only paintings sent from Munich, but some members of the German [[Die Brücke]] group, while from Paris came work by [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Fernand Léger]], as well as Picasso.

And the search continued: The [[Rayonism|Rayist]] (Luchizm) drawings of [[Natalia Goncharova]] and [[Mikhail Larionov]], used lines like rays of light to make a construction. [[Kasimir Malevich]] completed his first entirely abstract work, the [[Suprematist]], ''Black Square'', in 1915. Another of the Suprematist group' [[Liubov Popova]], created the Architectonic Constructions and Spatial Force Constructions between 1916 and 1921. [[Piet Mondrian]] was evolving his abstract language, of horizontal and vertical lines with rectangles of color, between 1915 and 1919, [[Neo-Plasticism]] was the aesthetic which Mondrian, Theo van Doesburg and other in the group [[De Stijl]] intended to reshape the environment of the future.

== Music ==

As visual art becomes more abstract, it develops some characteristics of music: an art form which uses the abstract elements of sound and divisions of time. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], himself an amateur musician,&lt;ref&gt;Shawn, Allen. 2003. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qgqp5-EqEw8C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq= Arnold Schoenberg's Journey]''. Harvard University Press. p. 62. {{ISBN|0674011015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;François Le Targat, ''Kandinsky'', Twentieth Century masters series, Random House Incorporated, 1987, p. 7, {{ISBN|0847808106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan B. Hirschfeld, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Hilla von Rebay Foundation, ''Watercolors by Kandinsky at the Guggenheim Museum: a selection from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Hilla von Rebay Foundation'', 1991. In 1871 the family moved to Odessa, where the young Kandinsky attended the Gymnasium and learned to play the cello and piano.&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired by the possibility of marks and associative color ''resounding in the soul.'' The idea had been put forward by [[Charles Baudelaire]], that all our senses respond to various stimuli but the senses are connected at a deeper aesthetic level.

Closely related to this, is the idea that art has ''The spiritual dimension'' and can transcend 'every-day' experience, reaching a spiritual plane. The [[Theosophical Society]] popularized the ancient wisdom of the sacred books of India and China in the early years of the century. It was in this context that [[Piet Mondrian]], Wassily Kandinsky, [[Hilma af Klint]] and other artists working towards an 'objectless state' became interested in the occult as a way of creating an 'inner' object.
The universal and timeless shapes found in [[geometry]]: the circle, square and triangle become the spatial elements in abstract art; they are, like color, fundamental systems underlying visible reality.

== Russian avant-garde ==

[[File:Black Square.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kazimir Malevich]], ''Black Square'', 1923, [[The Russian Museum]]]]

{{main article|Russian avant-garde|Futurism (art)|}}

Many of the abstract artists in Russia became [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivists]] believing that art was no longer something remote, but life itself. The artist must become a technician, learning to use the tools and materials of modern production. ''Art into life!'' was [[Vladimir Tatlin]]'s slogan, and that of all the future Constructivists. [[Varvara Stepanova]] and Alexandre Exter and others abandoned easel painting and diverted their energies to theatre design and graphic works.
On the other side stood [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Anton Pevsner]] and [[Naum Gabo]]. They argued that art was essentially a spiritual activity; to create the individual's place in the world, not to organize life in a practical, materialistic sense. Many of those who were hostile to the materialist production idea of art left Russia. Anton Pevsner went to France, Gabo went first to Berlin, then to England and finally to America. Kandinsky studied in Moscow then left for the [[Bauhaus]]. By the mid-1920s the revolutionary period (1917 to 1921) when artists had been free to experiment was over; and by the 1930s only [[socialist realism]] was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Camilla Gray, ''The Russian Experiment in Art, 1863–1922'', Thames and Hudson, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Bauhaus ==

The [[Bauhaus]] at Weimar, Germany was founded in 1919 by [[Walter Gropius]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Gropius et al., ''Bauhaus 1919–1928'' Herbert Bayer ed., Museum of Modern Art,publ. Charles T Banford,Boston,1959&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy underlying the teaching program was unity of all the visual and plastic arts from architecture and painting to weaving and stained glass. This philosophy had grown from the ideas of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in England and the [[Deutscher Werkbund]]. Among the teachers were [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Johannes Itten]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Anni Albers]], and [[László Moholy-Nagy]]. In 1925 the school was moved to Dessau and, as the [[Nazi party]] gained control in 1932, The Bauhaus was closed. In 1937 an exhibition of [[degenerate art]], 'Entartete Kunst' contained all types of [[avant-garde]] art disapproved of by the Nazi party. Then the exodus began: not just from the Bauhaus but from Europe in general; to Paris, London and America. Paul Klee went to Switzerland but many of the artists at the Bauhaus went to America.

== Abstraction in Paris and London ==

[[File:DasUndbild.jpg|thumb|[[Kurt Schwitters]], ''Das Undbild'', 1919, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]]

During the 1930s Paris became the host to artists from Russia, Germany, the Netherlands and other European countries affected by the rise of [[totalitarianism]]. [[Sophie Tauber]] and [[Jean Arp]] collaborated on paintings and sculpture using organic/geometric forms. The Polish [[Katarzyna Kobro]] applied mathematically based ideas to sculpture. The many types of abstraction now in close proximity led to attempts by artists to analyse the various conceptual and aesthetic groupings. An exhibition by forty-six members of the [[Cercle et Carré]] group organized by [[Joaquin Torres-Garcia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seuphor|first1=Michel|title=Geometric Abstraccion 1926-1949|date=1972|publisher=Dallas Museum of Fine Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; assisted by [[Michel Seuphor]]&lt;ref&gt;Michel Seuphor, ''Abstract Painting''&lt;/ref&gt; contained work by the Neo-Plasticists as well as abstractionists as varied as Kandinsky, Anton Pevsner and [[Kurt Schwitters]]. Criticized by [[Theo van Doesburg]] to be too indefinite a collection he published the journal ''Art Concret'' setting out a manifesto defining an abstract art in which the line, color and surface only, are the concrete reality.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Moszynska, ''Abstract Art'', p. 104, Thames and Hudson, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Abstraction-Création founded in 1931 as a more open group, provided a point of reference for abstract artists, as the political situation worsened in 1935, and artists again regrouped, many in London. The first exhibition of British abstract art was held in England in 1935. The following year the more international ''Abstract and Concrete'' exhibition was organized by [[Nicolete Gray]] including work by [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Ben Nicholson]]. Hepworth, Nicholson and Gabo moved to the [[St. Ives group]] in Cornwall to continue their 'constructivist' work.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Moszynska, ''Abstract Art'', Thames and Hudson, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

== America: mid-century ==
{{main article|Modernism|Late modernism|American Modernism|Surrealism|}}

[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1939-1942 - Composition 10.jpg|thumb|left|The above is a 1939–42 oil on canvas painting by Mondrian titled ''Composition No. 10''. Responding to it, fellow [[De Stijl]] artist [[Theo van Doesburg]] suggested a link between non-representational works of art and ideals of peace and spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Utopian Reality: Reconstructing Culture in Revolutionary Russia and Beyond; Christina Lodder, Maria Kokkori, Maria Mileeva; BRILL, Oct 24, 2013 "Van Doesburg stated that the purpose of art was to imbue man with those positive spiritual qualities that were needed in order to overcome the dominance of the physical and create the conditions for putting an end to wars. In an enthusiastic essay on Wassily Kandinsky he had written about the dialogue between the artist and the viewer, and the role of art as 'the educator of our inner life, the educator of our hearts and minds'. Van Doesburg subsequently adopted the view that the spiritual in man is nurtured specifically by abstract art, which he later described as 'pure thought, which does not signify a concept derived from natural phenomena but which is contained in numbers, measures, relationships, and abstract lines'. In his response to Piet Mondrian's ''Composition 10'', Van Doesburg linked peace and the spiritual to a non-representational work of art, asserting that 'it produces a most spiritual impression…the impression of repose: the repose of the soul'."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During the Nazi rise to power in the 1930s many artists fled Europe to the United States. By the early 1940s the main movements in modern art, expressionism, cubism, abstraction, [[surrealism]], and [[dada]] were represented in New York: [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[André Masson]], [[Max Ernst]], [[André Breton]], were just a few of the exiled Europeans who arrived in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Naylor, ''The Bauhaus'', Studio Vista, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The rich cultural influences brought by the European artists were distilled and built upon by local New York painters. The climate of freedom in New York allowed all of these influences to flourish. The art galleries that primarily had focused on European art began to notice the local art community and the work of younger American artists who had begun to mature. Certain artists at this time became distinctly abstract in their mature work. During this period Piet Mondrian's painting ''Composition No. 10'', 1939–1942, characterized by primary colors, white ground and black grid lines clearly defined his radical but classical approach to the rectangle and abstract art in general.
Some artists of the period defied categorization, such as [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] who, while a modernist abstractionist, was a pure maverick in that she painted highly abstract forms while not joining any specific group of the period.

Eventually American artists who were working in a great diversity of styles began to coalesce into cohesive stylistic groups. The best known group of American artists became known as the [[Abstract expressionists]] and the [[New York School (art)|New York School]]. In New York City there was an atmosphere which encouraged discussion and there was new opportunity for learning and growing. Artists and teachers [[John D. Graham]] and [[Hans Hofmann]] became important bridge figures between the newly arrived European Modernists and the younger American artists coming of age. [[Mark Rothko]], born in Russia, began with strongly surrealist imagery which later dissolved into his powerful color compositions of the early 1950s. The [[action painting|expressionistic gesture]] and the act of painting itself, became of primary importance to [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Robert Motherwell]], and [[Franz Kline]]. While during the 1940s [[Arshile Gorky]]'s and [[Willem de Kooning]]'s figurative work evolved into abstraction by the end of the decade. New York City became the center, and artists worldwide gravitated towards it; from other places in America as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Geldzahler]], ''New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940–1970'', Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later developments ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
{{main article|Abstract expressionism|Color field|Lyrical abstraction|Post-painterly abstraction|Sculpture|Minimal art|}}

[[Digital art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[geometric abstraction]], [[minimalism]], [[lyrical abstraction]], op art, abstract expressionism, color field painting, [[monochrome painting]], [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]], neo-Dada, [[shaped canvas]] painting, are a few directions relating to abstraction in the second half of the 20th century.

In the United States, ''Art as Object'' as seen in the [[Minimalist]] sculpture of [[Donald Judd]] and the paintings of [[Frank Stella]] are seen today as newer permutations. Other examples include [[Lyrical Abstraction]] and the sensuous use of color seen in the work of painters as diverse as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Patrick Heron]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Joan Mitchell]].

== Causation ==

One socio-historical explanation that has been offered for the growing prevalence of the abstract in modern art – an explanation linked to the name of [[Theodor W. Adorno]] – is that such abstraction is a response to, and a reflection of, the growing abstraction of social relations in [[industrial society]].&lt;ref&gt;David Cunningham, 'Asceticism Against Colour', in ''New Formations'' 55 (2005) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederic Jameson]] similarly sees modernist abstraction as a function of the abstract power of money, equating all things equally as exchange-values.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; The social ''content'' of abstract art is then precisely the abstract nature of social existence – legal formalities, bureaucratic impersonalization, information/power – in the world of [[late modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Analytical psychology#Post-Jungian approaches|Post-Jungians]] by contrast would see the quantum theories with their disintegration of conventional ideas of form and matter as underlying the divorce of the concrete and the abstract in modern art.&lt;ref&gt;Aniela Jaffé, in C. G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) pp. 288–89, 303&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nivea Men- Post Shave Balm.jpg|right|An example of aftershave|thumb]]

'''Aftershave''' is a liquid product applied to skin after [[shaving]]. It contains an [[antiseptic]] agent such as [[denatured alcohol]], stearate [[citrate]] or [[Witch hazel (astringent)|witch hazel]] to prevent infection of cuts, as well as to act as an [[astringent]] to reduce skin irritation. [[Menthol]] is used in some varieties as well to numb damaged skin, and it is an ingredient that [[shaving cream]] manufacturers have started including in their formulations, too.

An alcohol-based aftershave usually causes an immediate stinging sensation after applying it post-shave, with effects sometimes lasting several minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most commonly only for seconds. For this reason, a market consisting of highly differentiated products has been created—some using alcohols, some not.

Some aftershaves use [[fragrance]] or [[essential oil]] to enhance scent. [[Moisturizer]]s—natural and artificial, are often touted as able to soften the [[skin]].

Aftershave is sometimes mistakenly referred to as [[eau de cologne]] due to the very similar nature of the two products. Some aftershave manufacturers encourage using their fragranced aftershave as if it were cologne, in order to increase sales by encouraging consumers to use it in a more versatile manner, rather than just after a shaving session. Some aftershaves were inspired by a cologne.

Early aftershaves included [[witch-hazel]] and [[bay rum]], and have been documented in shaving guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/shavingmadeeasyw0020th |title=Shaving made easy; what the man who shaves ought to know .. : 20th century correspondence school, New York.

The '''''Allegory of Divine Providence and Barberini Power''''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/findrome/images/imagefiles/fresco/divine.html Image Files-Frescos]&lt;/ref&gt; is a fresco by Italian painter [[Pietro da Cortona]], filling the large ceiling of the grand salon of the [[Palazzo Barberini]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. Begun in 1633, it was nearly finished in three years; upon Cortona's return from Venice, it was extensively reworked to completion in 1639. The Palazzo, since the 1620s, had been the palatial home of the [[Barberini|Barberini family]] headed by Maffeo Barberini, by then [[Urban VIII]], who had launched an extensive program of refurbishment of the city with art and architecture.

==Composition==

These commissioned artworks often teem with suns and bees (the Barberini family coat of arms had three bees), as also the Cortona fresco does. At one end of the sky sits the eminent solar Divine Providence, while at the other end are putti and flying maidens holding aloft the papal keys, tiara, with robe belt above a swarm of heraldic giant golden bees. Below Providence, the simulated frame crumbles. Time with a scythe seems to swallow a putti's arm. A starry [[Crown of Immortality]] is ferried up to the heraldic swarm. Some scholars have suggested that one of the fresco's goals was to portray the Barberini papal election, which had been rumored to have been rigged, as divine providence. At one edge, are laborers in a forge so hard at work, they shatter the outer frame.

== Critical assessment and legacy==

Frescoes were numerous in Rome at the time; most represented galleries of framed episodes, ''[[quadro riportato]]'' such as found on the ceilings of the [[Sistine Chapel]] ceiling or in [[Annibale Carracci]]'s [[Palazzo Farnese]] (completed in 1601) cycle. [[Baldassare Peruzzi]] had pioneered this style of painting called [[quadratura]], in which the fresco replaces or simulates some of the architectural framework, using often forced perspective. Such [[trompe-l'oeil]] artifices were not novel to Italian art, since for example [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Giulio Romano]] in [[Mantua]] had featured such frescoes; however, for Cortona, the luminous sky became a teeming tour de force, a style that became influenced many other large fresco spectacles such as those by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] for example, in Madrid,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/t/tiepolo/gianbatt/8madrid/|Allegorical ceiling in [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] by Tiepolo.]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl|Ehrenstrahl]] in his "Council of the Virtues" from the [[House of Nobility (Sweden)|House of Nobility]], in [[Stockholm]] and in the frescoes depicting the ''Apotheosis of the Pisani Family'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://gallery.euroweb.hu/html/t/tiepolo/gianbatt/7_1760s/10pisan1.html ''Apotheosis of the Pisani Family''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315215956/http://gallery.euroweb.hu/html/t/tiepolo/gianbatt/7_1760s/10pisan1.html |date=2005-03-15 }} by Tiepolo at Villa Pisani in Stra.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Villa Pisani at Stra]]. Other famous ''[[sotto in su]]'' frescoes in Rome include [[Andrea Pozzo]]'s ''Apotheosis of St Ignatius'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/html/p/pozzo/apotheos.html ''Apotheosis of St. Ignatius''] by Pozzo&lt;/ref&gt; at the Roman church of [[Sant'Ignazio]].

'''Anne Edwards''' (born August 20, 1927,&lt;ref name="LibraryThing" /&gt; [[Port Chester, New York]], US&lt;ref name="Leigh" /&gt;) is an American author best known for her biographies of celebrities that include [[Princess Diana]], [[Maria Callas]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Margaret Mitchell]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Shirley Temple]] and [[Sophia Tolstaya|Countess Sonya Tolstoy]].

==Life and career==
She attended [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (1943–46) and [[Southern Methodist University]] (1947–48).&lt;ref name="Leigh" /&gt; A child performer on stage and radio, she began her writing career as a junior writer at [[MGM]] in 1944 and became a noted Hollywood screenwriter and television writer during the late 1940s and early 1950s.&lt;ref name="Leigh" /&gt; She lived in the UK and Europe from the mid-1950s until 1972.&lt;ref name="Leigh" /&gt; After returning to the United States in 1973, she lived in Massachusetts, New  York and Connecticut before returning to Beverly Hills, California, where she currently resides.&lt;ref name="Streisand" /&gt; Her film credits include co-writing the first draft of the screenplay for the film ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]'' (1968)&lt;ref name="Streisand" /&gt; starring [[Barbra Streisand]]. She wrote her first novel, the best-selling ''The Survivors'', in 1968 and subsequently (as of 2015) has written eight novels, sixteen biographies, three children's books, two memoirs (one with her late husband—composer-musicologist-pianist [[Stephen Citron]]&lt;ref name="Streisand" /&gt;) and an autobiography.  She is a past president of the [[Authors Guild]] and currently serves on its board of directors.&lt;ref name="AG" /&gt; Her collection of literary manuscripts, papers, and related materials is now part of the Special Collections Department of the [[Charles E. Young Research Library]]&lt;ref name="OAoC" /&gt; at [[UCLA]], where she has taught writing.

In an interview for ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Edwards said, "An idea hits me, then I develop the story or, in the case of a biography, think of a person who exemplifies that theme. Vivien [Leigh], Judy [Garland] and Sonya [Tolstoy] were vastly interesting people and symbolic of certain things: Judy, the exploitation of a woman; Vivien, somebody who suffered from manic-depression; Sonya, an intelligent woman subjugated to a man who used her, drained her, made a villain of her." &lt;ref name="gale" /&gt;

"'''Around the World'''" is a song by the [[French people|French]] [[electronic music]] duo [[Daft Punk]]. The song was written by the duo and appeared on their debut album ''[[Homework (Daft Punk album)|Homework]]'' in 1997 and was released as a single the same year. It became a major club hit around the world and reached number one in the dance charts. It also peaked at number one in Iceland and Italy. The song's only lyrics are the title. The [[music video]] was directed by [[Michel Gondry]] and choreographed by [[Blanca Li]]. In October 2011, ''[[NME]]'' placed it at number 21 on its list "150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/list/150-best-tracks-of-the-past-15-years/248648/page/13 |title=150 Best Tracks Of The Past 15 Years |publisher=Nme.Com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The key [[hook (music)|hook]] is a steady bassline and a robotic voice singing "around the world" in continuous chains. Daft Punk recalled that the song "was like making a [[Chic (band)|Chic]] record with a [[talk box]] and just playing the bass on the synthesizer".&lt;ref name="Wax"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Torres|first=Andre|date=April 2013|title=Quantum Leap|journal=[[Wax Poetics]]|url=http://www.waxpoetics.com/features/articles/quantum-leap|issue=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase occurs 144 times in the album version and 80 times in the [[radio edit]]. It is composed in the key of [[E minor]].

Upon analysis of the song, [[Michel Gondry]] noted its distinctive structure: "I realized how genius and simple the music was. Only five different instruments, with very few patterns, each to create numerous possibilities of figures. Always using the repetition, and stopping just before it's too much." He also noted the similarity between the [[bassline]] of "Around the World" and that of the Chic song [[Good Times (Chic song)|"Good Times"]].&lt;ref name="Michel Book 2003"&gt;''[[Director's Label#Volume 3: The Work of Director Michel Gondry|The Work of Director Michel Gondry]]'' companion book (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, computer scientist Colin Morris analyzed 15,000 [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hits for repetitiveness, based on [[compression algorithm]]s. "Around the World" was found to be the most repetitive of the songs analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Morris, [https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition Are Pop Lyrics Getting More Repetitive?], ThePudding&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[cover version]] of "Around the World" was released in 2006 as "Around the World Again" by Nicky Van She and Dangerous Dan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Discogs release|name="Around the World Again"|id=817600}}. Retrieved on August 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A remix of the [[will.i.am]] song "[[I Got It from My Mama]]" included a sample from "Around the World". Daft Punk did not approve use of the sample, however, and as such subsequently refused will.i.am permission to release the remix. A music video was produced with the sample included, however.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071002200025/http://www.thedailyswarm.com/swarm/daft-punk-william-not-my-momma/ Daft Punk to Will.i.am: Not from my Momma] The Daily Swarm. Retrieved on September 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A song titled "Around the World" was released by [[rapping|rapper]] P.M. that contains a sample of "Around the World".  [[Señor Coconut]] released a cover of "Around the World" on his 2008 album, ''Atom™ presents: Around the World with Señor Coconut and his Orchestra''.

"Around the World" was featured in one episode of first season of MTV animated series ''[[Daria]]''. It was also used in the video games ''[[Dance Central 3]]'',''[[NBA 2K13]]'' and ''[[Rayman Raving Rabbids 2]]''.

==Critical reception==
''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' put "Around the World" at 172nd place on their list of '500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born'. They wrote: {{cquote|This bubblegum robo-disco mantra was the song that made LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy fantasize about Daft Punk playing at his house. "I liked how wimpy 'Around the World' was," he explains. "It was really everything I hated, and I couldn't resist it. What a fucking track." Recorded in a bedroom, and boosted by director Michel Gondry's freaky-dancing video clip, "Around the World" made Paris hip again and left house music hooked on retro."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=1764 |title=The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born|accessdate=June 20, 2018|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217055432/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=1764|archivedate=December 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Music video==
&lt;!--
**ATTENTION EDITORS**: "Robots", "athletes", "skeletons", "disco girls" and "mummies" are specifically mentioned by Gondry in his notes. **SEE DISCUSSION PAGE**for any concerns.
--&gt;
[[Michel Gondry]]'s [[music video]] for the song features five groups of characters on a platform representing a [[vinyl record]]: four [[robot]]s walking around in a circle; four tall athletes (as described by Gondry)&lt;ref name="Michel Book 2003"/&gt; wearing [[tracksuit]]s with small [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] heads walking up and down stairs; four women dressed like [[synchronised swimming|synchronized swimmer]]s (described by Gondry as "disco girls")&lt;ref name="Michel Book 2003"/&gt; moving up and down another set of stairs; four [[skeleton]]s dancing in the center of the platform; and four [[mummy|mummies]] dancing in time with the song's drum pattern.

This is meant to be a visual representation of the song; each group of characters represents a different instrument. According to Gondry's notes,&lt;ref name="Michel Book 2003"/&gt; the robots represent the singing voice; the physicality and small-minded rapidity of the athletes symbolizes the ascending/descending bass guitar; the femininity of the disco girls represents the high-pitched keyboard; the "itchy" skeletons dance to the guitar line; and the mummies represent the drum machine.

"Around the World" was Gondry's first attempt at bringing organized dancing to his music videos. "I was sick to see choreography being mistreated in videos like filler with fast cutting and fast editing, really shallow. I don't think choreography should be shot in close-ups."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.director-file.com/gondry/daft.html "Around the World"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019051906/http://www.director-file.com/gondry/daft.html |date=October 19, 2006 }} director-file.com. Retrieved on October 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence, initially developed by Gondry, was further expanded and streamlined by choreographer [[Blanca Li]]. Costumes for the video were designed by Florence Fontaine, the mother of Gondry's son. The flashing lights were operated by the director's brother, Olivier "Twist" Gondry. As Michel Gondry stated, "It all came down to a family affair."&lt;ref name="Michel Book 2003"/&gt;

Elements of the music video appear in the video for the [[LCD Soundsystem]] song "[[Daft Punk Is Playing at My House]]". The overall design has also been replicated for the [[Freemasons (band)|Freemasons]]' "Rain Down Love" video.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3916">'''Book-packaging''' (or book producing) is a publishing activity in which a publishing company outsources the myriad tasks involved in putting together a book—writing, researching, editing, illustrating, and even printing—to an outside company called a book-packaging company. Once the book-packaging company has produced the book, they then  sell it to the final [[publishing company]].

In this arrangement, the book-packaging company acts as a liaison between a publishing company and the writers, researchers, editors, and printers that design and produce the book. Book packagers thus blend the roles of agent, editor, and publisher.&lt;ref name="Glatzer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutewrite.com/site/book_packaging.htm |author=Glatzer, Jenna |title=Book Packaging: Under-explored Terrain For Freelancers |accessdate=January 14, 2007 |work=Absolute Write |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113015633/http://www.absolutewrite.com/site/book_packaging.htm |archivedate=January 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Book-packaging is common in the [[genre fiction]] market, particularly for books aimed at preteens and teenagers, and in the illustrated non-fiction co-edition market.

==Business model==
Publishing companies use the services of book-packaging companies in cases where the publishing company does not have the in-house resources to handle a project.&lt;ref name="Glatzer" /&gt; There are two main reasons that publishing houses hire a book-packaging company: labor-intensive books (books with many illustrations or photographs, books which require coordinating the input of several authors, or 'novelty' books, such as gardening books that contain seed packages) and series books (e.g., [[Nancy Drew]], [[Sweet Valley High]], [[Goosebumps]], and the [[For Dummies]] series).&lt;ref name="Glatzer" /&gt;

In many cases, the book is first conceived as a [[marketing]] concept, and a writer is then hired to write the book on a [[work for hire]] basis. In some cases, book packaging companies use a [[celebrity]] with a very marketable name as the credited author, while using a professional [[ghostwriter]] to do most of the writing, researching, and editing.

Book-packaging is a common strategy between smaller publishers in different [[sales territory|territorial market]]s where the company that first buys the [[intellectual property]] rights, sells a package to other publishers and gains an immediate return on capital invested. The first publisher will often print sufficient copies for all territories and thereby obtain the maximum quantity discounts on the print run for all.

==Remuneration and credit==
While the book-packaging sector is little-known outside the publishing world, it provides employment to many freelance authors and illustrators, particularly for those willing to work as [[ghostwriter]]s, without credit in the book. Most book packaging companies pay a flat rate for manuscripts ranging from several thousand dollars to $1 per word. However, most book packaging companies do not pay [[royalties]], which means that even if a ghostwriter's novel becomes a bestseller, the writer will not receive additional payment.&lt;ref name="Glatzer" /&gt;

Often, writers or creators working for book-packagers work anonymously as ghostwriters, under the book-packaging company name ("by our staff writers"), or under a [[pen name]].  In some cases, a writer's work will be credited to someone else’s name, such as a [[celebrity]], who is paid to be listed as the credited author as a way of increasing sales.

'''The bushranger ban''' refers to a ban on films about [[bushrangers]] that came in effect in Australia in 1911-12. Films about bushrangers had been the most popular genre of local films ever since ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' (1906). Governments were worried about the influence this would have on the population and bans against films depicting bushrangers were introduced in [[South Australia]] (1911), [[New South Wales]] (a 1912 amendment to the 1908 New South Wales Theatres and Public Halls Act&lt;ref&gt;Graham Shirley &amp; Brian Adams, ''Australian Cinema The First Eighty Years'', Currency Press 1989 p 53&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (1912).&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/film-in-australia "Films in Australia", ''Australia.gov.au''] accessed 2 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15376293 |title=THE CENSOR. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=18 November 1912 |accessdate=4 May 2013 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision had a considerable impact on the local industry as it meant filmmakers could not work in a popular genre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/28/1043534055850.html Philippa Hawker, "Cinema's anti-hero rides again", ''The Age'', 29 January 2003] accessed 2 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Australian film production, which in 1911 was one of the highest in the world, went into decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/chronology/1910s/ Australian film and television chronology] at [[Australian Screen Online]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sensesofcinema.com/2001/feature-articles/oz_western/ More Australian than Aristotelian: The Australian Bushranger Film, 1904-1914by William D.

The ban was still in effect in the 1930s and hurt efforts to make a number of Australian movies, including an adaptation of ''[[Robbery Under Arms]]'' from director [[Ken G. Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51199259 |title=HOLLYWOOD Bushranger Film is "OUT". |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | date=27 October 1934 |accessdate=2 May 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17119163 |title=BONUSES FOR FILMS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=20 October 1934 |accessdate=12 May 2013 |page=20 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ban on a film about [[Ned Kelly]], ''[[When the Kellys Rode]]'' was not lifted until 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47176334 |title=FILM OF KELLY GANG. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=7 January 1942 |accessdate=3 May 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hollywood bushranging film ''[[Stingaree (1934 film)|Stingaree]]'' (1934) was screened in every state of Australia except for New South Wales because of the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article96373244 |title="OUT!"

== ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' ==
[[File:The Story of the Kelly Gang - Poster.jpg|thumb|Poster for ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' (1906)]]
The bushranger genre of Australian film fictionalized the experiences of [[Bushranger|bushrangers]] from Australian history. Bushrangers were outlaws, most active in the 19th century, and remembered in Australian folklore for their acts of robbery and violent crime, including murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/archives/collections-and-research/guides-and-indexes/bushrangers-nsw|title=Bushrangers in NSW|website=www.records.nsw.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre showed how the bushrangers’ intimate connection with the bush allowed them to skirt the law and engage in outlaw activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheckels|first=Theodore F.|date=June 1998|title="New Wave" Cinema's Redefinition of Australian Heroism|url=|journal=Antipodes|volume=12|pages=29-36|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the films made before the ban glorified bushrangers, rather than making them seem criminal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793340159|title=Historical dictionary of crime films|last=Geoff,|first=Mayer,|isbn=9780810867697|location=Lanham, Md.|oclc=793340159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early bushranger films include ''[[Bushranging in North Queensland|Bushranging in Northern Queensland]]'' and ''Robbery of a Mail Coach by Bushrangers.'' Both were released in 1904 and ran five minutes long and six minutes long respectively.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/757462033|title=Australian horror films, 1973-2010|last=1962-|first=Shelley, Peter,|date=2012|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers|isbn=9780786461677|location=Jefferson, N.C.|oclc=757462033}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', about the bushranger [[Ned Kelly]], was released in [[Melbourne]] on December 26, 1906.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' is notable for being the first feature film ever made.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the time of its release, it was considered to be the longest film that had ever been made, running at around seventy to eighty minutes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/irish_in_australia/bushrangers|title=National Museum of Australia - Bushrangers|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nma.gov.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the majority of the bushranger films that would follow it, ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' was relatively sympathetic to the outlaws whose lives it fictionalized. As a result, the government of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] tried to censor it when it was first released, claiming that it was encouraging crime. It was banned in two towns that had a relation to the gang presented in the movie.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite government discontent, ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' was a major commercial success, both nationally and internationally. One of the producers of the film stated that it made 25,000 pounds, in comparison to its budget of 1000 pounds.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Bushranger films from 1906 to 1912 ==
[[File:Mad Dog Morgan.jpg|thumb|252x252px|Wood carving of the bushranger Dan "Mad Dog" Morgan]]
The success of ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' encouraged filmmakers to produce even more bushranger films.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/587198895|title=Australia &amp; New Zealand|date=2010|publisher=Intellect Books|others=Goldsmith, Ben, 1967-, Lealand, Geoffrey.|isbn=9781841503738|location=Bristol, UK|oclc=587198895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1900 and 1914, one hundred and sixteen bushranger films were made in Australia.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910448038|title=Censorship : a World Encyclopedia.|last=Stockbridge|first=Sally L.|date=2015|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=|isbn=9781136798641|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=Derek|location=Hoboken|pages=|chapter="Australia: Film and Video"|oclc=910448038}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most, if not all, of these films focused on the lives of white male bushrangers.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/435778744|title=The A to Z of Australian and New Zealand cinema|last=Albert.|first=Moran,|date=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|others=Vieth, Errol, 1950-, Moran, Albert.|isbn=9780810863477|location=Lanham|oclc=435778744}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few of the most significant bushranger films made in this period include ''[[Thunderbolt (1910 film)|Thunderbolt]]'' (1910), ''[[Captain Midnight, the Bush King]]'' (1911), multiple adaptations of the classic bushranger novel ''[[Robbery Under Arms]]'', and ''[[Dan Morgan (film)|Dan Morgan]]'' (1911). ''Dan Morgan'' was notable for depicting its protagonist, the historical outlaw [[Dan Morgan (bushranger)|Dan Morgan]], as a true criminal, rather than an anti-hero.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793340159|title=Historical dictionary of crime films|last=Geoff,|first=Mayer,|isbn=9780810867697|location=Lanham, Md.|oclc=793340159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graphic violence of ''Dan Morgan'' was unlike the content of any bushranger film before it, and it spurred the governments of New South Wales and Victoria to pass regulations on film content the very next year.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Theatres and Public Halls Act of 1912 ==
In 1912, New South Wales’s Theatres and Public Halls Act was amended to directly target the content of films. Specifically, the 1912 amendment was meant to prohibit the screening of “objectionable” films – films with&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/117688374?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-availability=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-australian=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-decade=191|title=Censoring Films: Regulations Gazetted.|last=|first=|date=November 6, 1912|work=Evening News|access-date=|location=Sydney, NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“scenes suggestive of immorality or indecency, executions, murders, or other revolting scenes; scenes of debauchery, low habits of life, or other scenes such as would have a demoralizing effect on young person; successful crime, such as bushranging, robberies, or other acts of lawlessness…”&lt;/blockquote&gt;The New South Wales government claimed that the Theatres and Public Halls Act of 1912 was meant to protect film audiences, particularly young audiences, from “injurious influence.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This included the criminal activity of bushrangers. They were also against most bushranger films' depiction of the police as an antagonistic force.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Anyone going against the Act could be subject to a fine of up to 20 pounds.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The police were placed in charge of censoring films in accordance with the standards set by the 1912 amendment. They were to look over film summaries in order to determine their appropriateness, and could also demand a screening of a film if they thought it contained any “objectionable” material.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Censorship of film imports and exports ==
In 1917, state censor boards were supplemented by a national Commonwealth Film Censorship Board. The national Censorship Board judged the content of imported films, primarily those from Britain and the USA. State censor boards could take additional action if they believed that the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board had acted too leniently.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 1920, the Chief Secretary of Victoria attempted to prevent the development of a film about the [[Kelly Gang]] that he believed would spread a negative image of Victoria. The Australian government feared that attempts to ban the film in Australia would result in its international distribution. The government worried that the international release of any films that portrayed Australia negatively would damage the country’s global image. Though the government could not intervene in the creation of a film, it could control its distribution. That year, the Minister of Customs was placed in charge of regulating the export of films from Australia to other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/127388446?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=192&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-australian=y|title=Export of Films: Why Prohibition Was Applied.|last=|first=|date=January 3, 1920|work=The Maitland Weekly Mercury|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of the ban on Australian film ==
Before the bushranger ban, bushranging had been the most common topic for Australian films. After the ban, film production in Australia decreased as creators lost their most popular genre and the audiences it drew to the theatres.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Unsurprisingly, the new censorship forces were met with discontent from the Australian film industry. H.M. Hawkins, the managing director of [[Spencer's Pictures|Spencer’s Pictures]], argued that censorship would limit the industry’s ability grow, since depictions of crime were essential to the creation of a successful drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/228833817?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-availability=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-australian=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-decade=191|title=Film Censorship "Will Cripple the Picture Business"|last=|first=|date=November 17, 1912|work=The Sun|access-date=|location=Sydney, NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December of 1916, a week after a violent film about gambling was prevented from being screened, a group of Australian film exhibitors gathered to discuss the impact of censorship on their business.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/121345461?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-availability=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-australian=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-decade=191|title=Film Censorship: Exhibitors Meet To-Day|last=|first=|date=December 17, 1916|work=Sunday Times|access-date=|location=Sydney, NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt; They expressed frustration with the fact that the police were in charge of film censors, claiming that the police department was most threatened by bushranger films' depictions of crime and as a result was hardest on crime in film over all other content.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They also pointed out that films were being censored far more harshly than written material with the same content.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The primary threat the New South Wales government saw in bushranger films was their apparent glorification of crime. As a result, some bushranger films could get through the censors if the criminal activity they depicted was condemned within the film and law enforcement wasn’t shown in a negative light.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, because of the stigma that had developed around the genre, few directors were willing to risk making bushranger films, especially if they had established reputations to uphold. In 1920, the director [[Raymond Longford]] avoided adapting ''Robbery Under Arms'' in order to preserve his status within the Australian film industry.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Decline of the bushranger ban ==

The end of the bushranger ban was arguably indicated by the 1942 release of ''[[When the Kellys Rode]]'' in New South Wales. ''When the Kellys Rode'', a bushranger film about the Kelly Gang, had been banned in 1934. It was the last film banned under the Theatres and Public Halls Act for bushranging content.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/18077432?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-australian=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-decade=194|title=Film Banned in N.S.W.: 'Brighton Rock'|last=|first=|date=July 10, 1948|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Baddeley]], Chief Secretary of New South Wales, finally allowed it to screen in New South Wales in the midst of [[World War II]], claiming that the crimes that the film depicted were nothing compared to “the unbridled horrors of war.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/205278235?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-availability=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-australian=y|title=Ban on Kelly Gang Film Removed|last=|first=|date=January 7, 1942|work=The Age|access-date=|location=Melbourne, Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''When the Kellys Rode'', the Theatres and Public Halls Act was invoked again by Chief Secretary Baddeley to ban the violent British film ''[[Brighton Rock (1948 film)|Brighton Rock]]''. ''Brighton Rock'' had been allowed into Australia by the Commonwealth Film Censorship Appeals Board, and the Chief Secretary would state no reason for the decision to ban the film in New South Wales.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

By the time that bushranger ban was finally lifted in the 1940s, the popularity of and demand for the genre had already faded.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Even after bushranging in film was legal, at least one attempt to produce a bushranger film was met with discontent from Australian citizens. In 1947, residents of [[Glenrowan, Victoria|Glenrowan]], a town associated with the Kelly Gang, protested against [[Harry Southwell]]’s plans to shoot a film about Ned Kelly in their town. Glenrowan’s farmers sent a petition to Parliament to ban the film, claiming that bushranger films had given a negative reputation to the descendants of the Kelly Gang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/161306059?searchTerm=bushranger%20film%20ban%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=l-australian=y&amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124;l-decade=194|title=Ned Kelly Revival: Bitter Opposition to Film|last=|first=|date=August 16, 1947|work=National Advocate|access-date=|location=Bathurst, New South Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chris Kraus''' (born 1955&lt;ref&gt;[http://egs.edu/faculty/chris-kraus "Chris Kraus".] egs.edu. Retrieved 27 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American writer and filmmaker. Her novels include ''[[I Love Dick]]'', ''[[Aliens &amp; Anorexia]]'', ''Torpor'', and ''Summer of Hate''. ''[[Video Green]]'', Kraus' first non-fiction book examines the explosion of late 1990s art by high-profile graduate programs that catapulted [[Los Angeles]] into the center of the international art world.{{whom|date=September 2017}} Her films include ''Gravity &amp; Grace'', ''How To Shoot A Crime'', and ''The Golden Bowl, or, Repression''.

== Biography ==
Kraus was born in [[New York City]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://culturalicons.co.nz/episode/chris-kraus "Conversations with iconic people – Chris Kraus".] culturalicons.co.nz. Retrieved 27 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and spent her childhood in Connecticut and New Zealand. After obtaining a BA at a young age from [[Victoria University of Wellington]], [[New Zealand]], Kraus worked as a journalist for five years, and then moved to [[New York City]]. Kraus was aged 21 when she arrived in New York and began studying with actor [[Ruth Maleczech]] and director [[Lee Breuer]], whose studio in the East Village was called ReCherChez.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, Kayla. "[http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/interviews/chris-kraus-real-fine-arts/ Interview: Performing Is Storytelling: Q+A with Chris Kraus]." ''Art in America''. 2011 June 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kraus made films and [[video art]] and staged performances and plays at many venues. In the late 1970s she was a member of [[The Artists Project]], a City-funded public service venture of painters, poets, writers, filmmakers and dancers.

Her work as a performance and video artist satirized the Downtown scene's gender politics and favored literary tropes, blending theatrical techniques with [[Dada]], literary criticism, social activism, and [[performance art]].

Kraus is Jewish and deals with many spiritual and social aspects of Judaism in her works. She says that her parents attended Christian church and did not tell her that her family is Jewish until she moved back to Manhattan at age 21, possibly to shield her from antisemitism.&lt;ref name="k-word"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sonkin|first1=Rebecca|title=Chris Kraus and the K-Word|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/chris-kraus-k-word/|accessdate=17 May 2017|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|date=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tablet" /&gt;

She continued to make films through the mid-1990s. As of 2006 she was married to [[Sylvère Lotringer]], a Jewish man who survived the [[Holocaust]] as a child,&lt;ref name="tablet"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cahmi|first1=Leslie|title=The Tense of Trauma - Novelist Chris Kraus ponders the meaning of “It would have been”|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/864/the-tense-of-trauma|website=Tablet Magazine|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=7 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they had divorced by 2016.&lt;ref name="k-word" /&gt; Some of her works are based on her marriage and her ex-husband.&lt;ref name="k-word" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tablet" /&gt; She now lives in [[Los Angeles]].

In 2017, Kraus published ''After Kathy Acker'', a biography of [[Kathy Acker]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 31 August 2017"&gt;{{cite news |last= Laing |first= Olivia | authorlink= Olivia Laing| title= After Kathy Acker by Chris Kraus review – sex, art and a life of myths |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/31/after-kathy-acker-by-chris-kraus-review| date= 31 August 2017| newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=6 September 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
===I Love Dick===

''[[I Love Dick]]'' is an [[epistolary novel]], a series of love letters to an elusive addressee, later identified as [[Dick Hebdige]]. In an introduction to the second edition of the novel, [[Eileen Myles]] writes, "Chris' ultimate achievement is philosophical.  She's turned female [[Social rejection|abjection]] inside out and aimed it at a man.  As if her decades of experience were both a painting and a weapon.  As if she, a hag, a jew, a poet, a failed filmmaker, a former go-go dancer—an intellectual, a wife, as if she had the right to go right up to the end of the book and ''live'' having felt all that.  ''I Love Dick'' boldly suggests that Chris Kraus' unswervingly attempted and felt female life is a total work ''and'' it didn't kill her." &lt;ref&gt;New York Magazine - 17 November 1997 - Page 20 "But this first literary effort by Chris Kraus, an alternative filmmaker who is also a fiction editor at Semiotext(e), got the wrong kind of attention. Her confessional roman a clef about the mossy realm of academe and the glossy SoHo-Chelsea art scene nearly landed her in court."&lt;/ref&gt; In  2016, [[Jill Soloway]] adapted the novel as a [[I_Love_Dick_(TV_series)|TV series]], produced by [[Amazon Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/18/i-love-dick-amazon-produced-by-jill-soloway-creator-transparent| title = Coming from the creator of Transparent: I Love Dick, the TV version of cult novel| last = Gajanan| first = Mahita| date = 2016-02-18| newspaper = The Guardian| language = en-GB| issn = 0261-3077| access-date = 2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first season was released on May 12, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.metacritic.com/tv/i-love-dick/critic-reviews| title = ''I Love Dick'' critic reviews| date = May 24, 2017| accessdate = 2017-05-24| publisher = metacritic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aliens and Anorexia===
''Aliens and Anorexia'' jumps back and forth in time and location, tracing the life and activism of [[Ulrike Meinhof]], the downtown theatre scene in late seventies New York, the drug experiments of [[Aldous Huxley]], the paintings and writings of [[Paul Thek]], through the narrator Chris's fruitless attempts to make and sell a feature film, "Gravity and Grace", (which takes its title from the [[Simone Weil]] volume of the same name).

===Video Green===
A series of 23 essays written between 1998 and 2003, mostly in her column "Torpor" in the magazine Artext, ''Video Green'' is dense with the literary, the personal, and the culturally marginal.  A few of the collection's notable essays ''not'' about L.A. include the elegiac "Posthumous Lives", about the performance artist Penny Arcade's loving curation of the estate of the filmmaker Jack Smith, and "How to Shoot a Crime," about Kraus's 1987 film of the same name.  The volume's first essay and its lengthiest, "Art Collection" follows the idea of collecting through L.A.'s M.F.A. art scene and real estate market, ending up in rural upstate New York with the extraordinary poetry—and art collection—of the all-but forgotten William Bronk.

===Torpor===
''Torpor'' follows Jerome Shafir, a literature professor at Columbia, his wife, Sylvie Green, a writer and filmmaker with an inconclusive career, and their dog Lily through rustbelt [[New York City]], Paris, Berlin, and the [[Eastern Bloc]] at the dawn of the New World Order.  As much a shattering portrait of a Holocaust survivor as portrait of a marriage, ''Torpor'' is also the portrait of a lady rarely found in literature: a down-and-out intellectual bearing witness to a culture in collapse{{According to whom|date=March 2018}}. In ''Torpor'', Kraus shifts out of the first-person narration of ''[[I Love Dick]]'', employing a kind of free-indirect discourse.  In naming her central characters Sylvie and Jerome, Kraus alludes to the hapless, interchangeable protagonists of [[George Perec]]'s first novel, ''Les Choses''.  Perec, a childhood friend of both ''Torpor'''s Jerome and Kraus's real-life husband, [[Sylvère Lotringer]], is quoted several times in the novel.  [[Felix Guattari]] and [[Nan Goldin]] also make appearances, among other cultural figures, though Kraus's use of "reality" comes to more subversive effect than a simple ''roman à clef''.

===Summer of Hate===
''Summer of Hate'' is the story of Catt Dunlop who, like Kraus, is an art critic and occasional professor of Cultural Studies. Emerging rattled from a dangerous relationship with a dominant sex partner she met online, Catt invests in a handful of corroding properties in [[Albuquerque]] and moves there to prepare them for rental. She hires Paul Garcia to work as her property manager, and they begin a romantic relationship, though Catt is still married to an older philosopher in [[New York City]]. A recovering alcoholic, Paul is on parole after spending two years in prison for “stealing less than an art gallery spends on an after-party.” Eventually Paul is pulled over for speeding and arrested in fulfillment of an outstanding warrant, and the pair embarks on a grueling legal process involving inhumane prison practices and impossible parole stipulations. Back in [[Los Angeles]] Catt studies and teaches “all the books about symbolic violence, soft forms of control,” but the forms of control to which Paul is subject are neither soft nor symbolic. As the course of her life fuses with the course of Paul’s, Catt's relationship to class, race, citizenship and criminality become increasingly complicated, forming the basis of Kraus' novelistic critique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.full-stop.net/2012/09/04/reviews/meagan-day/summer-of-hate-chris-kraus/ "Summer of Hate"] reviewed at ''Full Stop''. 4 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Kathy Acker===
''After Kathy Acker'' is a biography of [[Kathy Acker]], a radical American experimental novelist, poet, and essayist. Writing in the ''[[Financial_Times|FT]]'', Lauren Elkin wrote that Kraus "is the perfect mediator for Acker, finding in her work an aesthetics of provocation, discomfiture, risk and radical empathy." Reviewing the book for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Olivia Laing]] noted, "Acker was the previous girlfriend of Kraus's now ex-husband, Sylvère Lotringer, like Kraus an editor at the independent publisher Semiotext(e) and a frequent interlocutor here. Is it crass to point this out? It certainly complicates any objective perspective, and maybe it would have been better to state it plainly, especially since it's logged in ''I Love Dick'', the roman-à-clef that made Kraus famous. That said, Kraus reconstitutes Acker's wanderings with real wit and beauty, understanding without pandering to the painfully high stakes of her identity games."&lt;ref name="Guardian 31 August 2017"/&gt;

==Semiotext(e) Native Agents Series==
[[Sylvère Lotringer]], Kraus's husband from the late eighties to the late nineties, founded [[Semiotexte]]'s Foreign Agents series, which mostly published French critical theorists, in 1980. Ten years later Kraus founded the press's Native Agents imprint to publish fiction, mostly by women, as an analogue to the French theories of subjectivity in the Foreign Agents series.&lt;ref name="nplusonemag.com"&gt;"Female Trouble," Elizabeth Gumport, n+1 Magazine, 14 February 2012 http://nplusonemag.com/female-trouble&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to groundbreaking works of fiction by writers like [[Michelle Tea]] and [[Ann Rower]], Native Agents has published notable volumes of poetry and prose by [[Eileen Myles]], [[Barbara Barg]], and [[Fanny Howe]], as well as memoirs and interviews by [[Kathy Acker]], [[Bob Flanagan]], David Rattray, and [[William Burroughs]]. In a 2012 piece for ''[[n+1]]'', senior editor Elizabeth Gumport wrote "What united the Native Agents authors was the way their work combined elements of theory, fiction, and biography, explicitly refusing to identify absolutely with any single genre."&lt;ref name="nplusonemag.com"/&gt;

==Films==
Before beginning her career as writer, Kraus was an artist and filmmaker, making a number of short films and videos, including one feature ''Gravity &amp; Grace''. Her films have been the focus of a number of international retrospective exhibitions and screenings, beginning in 2008 with “Plastic is Leather, Fuck You: Film and Video 1983-1993” at Galerie Cinzia Friedlaender, Berlin. In the press release for the 2011 exhibition at Real Fine Arts in [[Brooklyn]], Kraus detailed her thoughts behind the production of these films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Press release for "Chris Kraus ''Films''"|publisher=Real Fine Arts|location=Brooklyn, New York|url=http://realfinearts.com/files/gimgs/35_ck.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Chance Event==
The Chance Event: Three Days in the Desert: Primm, Nevada, November 1996.  Curated by Chris Kraus, Chance brought together [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Rosanne Alluquere Stone]], [[DJ Spooky]], Diane di Prima, the Moapa Band of Paiute Indians, visual artists, garage noise bands and 600 participants to investigate the mystery of chance at Whiskey Pete's Casino.  Variously described as "a philosophy rave" and "one of the landmark LA events of the 90s," The Chance Event was reviewed on the front page of [[the LA Times]] and throughout the art press.  Highlights, including a performance by Baudrillard wearing a gold Elvis-inspired blazer and accompanied by the 'Chance' band, were broadcast on European television. The event was funded by the French Cultural Service and Art Center College of Design.

==Influence==
Though best known in the art world for much of her career, Kraus's readership is beginning to increase.&lt;ref&gt;"The Novelist as Performance Artist," Michael M. Miller, Gallerist, 30 October 2012 http://galleristny.com/2012/10/the-novelist-as-performance-artist-on-chris-kraus-the-art-worlds-favorite-fiction-writer/&lt;/ref&gt; She's been referenced in the work of poet [[Ariana Reines]], novelist and memoirist [[Kate Zambreno]], and [[n+1]]'s pamphlet No Regrets.&lt;ref&gt;No Regrets, n+1 http://shop.nplusonemag.com/products/no-regrets&lt;/ref&gt;

In an introduction to her September 2013 interview with Kraus in [[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]], author [[Sheila Heti]] wrote "I know there was a time before I read Chris Kraus’s ''I Love Dick'' (in fact, that time was only five years ago), but it’s hard to imagine; some works of art do this to you. They tear down so many assumptions about what the form can handle (in this case, what the form of the novel can handle) that there is no way to re-create your mind before your encounter with them."&lt;ref&gt;"Interview with Chris Kraus,' Sheila Heti, The Believer, September 2013 http://www.believermag.com/issues/201309/?read=interview_kraus&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dimanche.jpg|thumb|250px|''Dimanche'', 1960]]
'''''Dimanche''''' (''Sunday''), also known as '''''Dimanche - Le Journal d'un Seul Jour''''' (''Sunday - The Newspaper for Only One Day'') is an [[artist's book]] by the French artist [[Yves Klein]]. Taking the form of a 4-page Sunday [[broadsheet]], the piece was published on Sunday 27 November 1960 and sold on newsstands throughout [[Paris]] for one day only, as well as being handed out at a press conference held by Klein at the Galerie Rive Droite at 11.00am on the same day.

An early example of [[conceptual art]], it is most famous for being the first time that the photo-montage commonly known as ''The Leap Into The Void'' was published.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Dimanche combines appropriation, performance, actionism, conceptual art, and photo-montage all in one, and hints at this range of art movements just then coming into existence. It takes the form of a one-day newspaper, designed as an alternative to the regular Sunday paper, and includes texts and visual works by Klein, including his manifesto, "Theatre du Vide" (Theater of the Void). The photograph, captioned "Un homme dans l'espace" (A man in open space) depicts the artist leaping from his dealer's second-story window into the void. It inspired numerous artists to explore their bodies as a medium for art.' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsconnected.org/resource/84870/dimanche Artsconnected.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The festival of avant-garde art==
[[Image:Klein-newsstand.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A parisian news stand selling ''Dimanche'', November 27, 1960]]
The work was part of the second ''Festival d’Art d’Avant-Garde'' (''Festival of Avant-garde Art'') at the Palais des Expositions, Porte de Versailles, Paris. Taking the form of a parody of the French newspaper 'Journal du Dimanche', the Sunday edition of [[France Soir]], the book presents Klein’s ideas about the ''Théâtre du Vide'' (''Theatre of the Void'') and was the first time the famous photo ''Un Homme Dans L’Espace-Le Peintre de l’Espace se Jette Dans le Vide!'' (''Man In Space! The Painter of Space Throws Himself into The Void!'') was published.

According to Klein, the intention was to declare the entire 24-hour period an international theatrical happening, 'a holiday, a veritable spectacle of the void, at the culminating point of my theories.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Dimanche&lt;/ref&gt;' Merging art and life seamlessly, Klein's theatre would encapsulate each spectator's life as they lived it on that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coskunfineart.com/biography.asp?artistID=35 Yves Klein (1928 - 1962 - Biographical information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Several thousand copies were printed and distributed to news stands throughout Paris, with the help of Klein's friends. The artwork cost 0.35 [[French franc#The new franc|Francs]] and sold well.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Hannah Weitemeier, Taschen, p51&lt;/ref&gt;

==The book itself==

===The ''Leap into the Void''===
The most famous section of the book was the photographic collage, published with the caption 'The painter of space throws himself into the void! &lt;ref&gt;French; 'Le peintre de l'espace se jette dans le vide'&lt;/ref&gt;' but usually known as the ''Leap Into The Void''. This photomontage, taken by [[Harry Shunk]], was montaged from a number of photos. The leap itself took place at 3 Rue Gentil Bernard, Fontenay-Aux_Roses, in October 1960, using about a dozen [[Judoka]]s from a Judo School opposite, holding a large tarpaulin to land on.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p220&lt;/ref&gt; Klein himself was a 4th Dan Judo Master. Shunk then montaged a shot of the empty street onto the photo. In fact there were 3 versions of this photo produced; one with Klein’s 2CV was never used; the one with a train and a cyclist was used for Dimanche; the third with an empty street and without the train was requested by Klein himself the next day to be used in the forthcoming catalogue for his retrospective at [[Krefeld]]. This strategy of employing two versions of the same montage, effectively bringing attention to the deception was typical of Klein's artistic strategy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I am the painter of Space. I am not an abstract painter but, on the contrary, a figurative and realist painter. Let's be honest, in order to paint space, I must put myself on the spot, in space itself." Yves Klein, quoted underneath the photo 'Man In Space' on the front cover of Dimanche&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p217&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Theatre of the Void''===
As well as declarations of intent, the book contains a series of theatre pieces, ''Théâtre du Vide'' (''Theatre of the Void'') that prefigure various [[Fluxus|Fluxus scores]] of a kind that would later come to be known as [[happenings]].
Pieces contained within the book include;

''Sleep''; The setting is a bedroom. The scene opens with a man asleep in a big bed. The actor must really be sleeping. Each performance lasts about 10 minutes and in silence. There is to be applause at the end.

''Inversion''; For one performance, any play will be presented upside down. All the actors will have their feet on the ceiling and their heads hanging down. This will be possible by trickery. All the furniture will also be on the ceiling, which will really be the floor. A chandelier will therefore levitate in space.

''The Five Rooms''; In order to promote the feeling and matter without the intermediary of energy,  spectators pass through 5 rooms, their feet bound by ball and chain. 9 monochrome blue paintings of the same format are in the first room; the second room is empty and entirely white; nine monogold paintings of the same format are in the third room; the fourth room is empty and dark, almost black; 9 monopink paintings of the same format are in the fifth room.

''From Dizziness to Prestige''; Having practiced levitation and attempted a kind of purifying sublimation by which he would free himself from the exasperation of the ego, and having created or proposed various aerostatic sculptures that were free from the enslavement of pedestals, Klein presents himself on stage stretched out in space a few meters above the ground for 5 or 10 minutes. The performance takes place without commentary.

These pieces hover between the possible and the imaginary, establishing that the pieces aren’t meant to exist literally, but in the mind of the reader. This prefigures many of the concerns of [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref name="weitemeier"&gt;Klein By Hannah Weitemeier, Taschen, p51&lt;/ref&gt; The book also contained a b/w reproduction of an [[International Klein Blue]] monochrome painting, and some sketches of [[Judo]] manoeuvres.

Whilst some of the pieces relate to earlier writings and statements by Klein, most were written in a hectic four-day period immediately prior to publication, in a bar with friends.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Berggruen, Hollein, Pfeiffer, Hatje Kantz&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[[Joseph Kosuth]] hailed him as the father of conceptual art; the [[fluxus]] movement, happenings, performances, and body art, each in its own way, was structurally related to [Klein's] work. What these streams had in common was an incentive to discover a mode of creativity that transcended national frontiers, to define its aesthetic criteria, and to disseminate the results. In this process, Klein figured in the classical role of emissary, heralding a new culture to come- invisible to the eye, yet universally present nonetheless." Hannah Weitemeier &lt;ref name="weitemeier"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The word '''diorama''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|m|ə}} can either refer to a 19th-century mobile theatre device, or, in modern usage, a three-dimensional full-size or miniature model, sometimes enclosed in a glass showcase for a museum. Dioramas are often built by hobbyists as part of related hobbies such as [[Model military vehicle|military vehicle modeling]], [[Model figure|miniature figure modeling]], or [[Model airplane|aircraft modeling]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== Etymology ==
The word "diorama" originated in 1823 as a type of picture-viewing device, from the French in 1822. The word literally means "through that which is seen", from the [[greek language|Greek]] di- "through" + orama "that which is seen, a sight". The diorama was invented by [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[Charles Marie Bouton]], first exhibited in [[Paris]] in July 1822 and in [[London]] on September 29, 1823.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Daguerre#Diorama theatres|Diorama Theatres - Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|date=January 2017}} The meaning "small-scale replica of a scene, etc." is from 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/etymology/diorama Diorama - Word Origin &amp; History] - Online Etymology Dictionary - ''Dictionary.com''. Retrieved 1 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daguerre's and Bouton's diorama consisted of a piece of material painted on both sides. When illuminated from the front, the scene would be shown in one state and by switching to illumination from behind another phase or aspect would be seen. Scenes in daylight changed to moonlight, a train travelling on a track would crash, or an earthquake would be shown in before and after pictures.

== The modern diorama ==
[[File:Cooling tower construction diorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cooling tower]] construction diorama]]
The current, popular understanding of the term "diorama" denotes a partially three-dimensional, full-size replica or [[scale model]] of a landscape typically showing historical events, nature scenes or cityscapes, for purposes of education or entertainment.

One of the first uses of dioramas in a museum was in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], where the [[Biological museum (Stockholm)|Biological Museum]] opened in 1893. It had several dioramas, over three floors. They were also implemented by the National Museum Grigore Antipa from Bucharest Romania and constituted a source of inspiration for many important museums in the world (such as the Museum of Natural History of New York and the Great Oceanographic Museum in Berlin) [reference below]. 

===Miniatures===
Miniature dioramas are typically much smaller, and use scale models and landscaping to create historical or fictional scenes. Such a scale model-based diorama is used, for example, in [[Chicago]]'s [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] to display [[Rail transport|railroading]]. This diorama employs a common [[Rail transport modelling|model railroading]] scale of 1:87 ([[HO scale]]). Hobbyist dioramas often use scales such as 1:35 or 1:48.

An early, and exceptionally large example was created between 1830 and 1838 by a British Army officer. [[William Siborne]], and represents the [[Battle of Waterloo]] at about 7.45 pm, on 18 June, 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nam.ac.uk/online-collection/detail.php?acc=1975-05-56-1 |title=Model of the field of Waterloo with troops positioned as at 19.45 hours, 18 June 1815. |publisher=National Army Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diorama measures {{convert|8.33|by|6|m}} and used around 70,000 model soldiers in its construction. It is now part of the collection of the [[National Army Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waterloo200.org/200-object/captain-sibornes-model-of-waterloo/ |title=Captain Siborne’s Model of Waterloo |website=Waterloo 200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sheperd Paine]], a prominent hobbyist, popularized the modern miniature diorama beginning in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

=== Full size dioramas ===
[[Image:DSC01677 Diorama isole Lofoten - Museo di storia naturale, Milano - Foto di G. Dall'Orto - 20-12-2006.jpg|thumbnail|A diorama in the Museum of Natural History in [[Milan]] (Italy)]]

Modern museum dioramas may be seen in most major natural history museums. Typically, these displays use a tilted plane to represent what would otherwise be a level surface, incorporate a painted background of distant objects, and often employ false perspective, carefully modifying the scale of objects placed on the plane to reinforce the [[illusion]] through [[depth perception]] in which objects of identical real-world size placed farther from the observer appear smaller than those closer. Often the distant painted background or sky will be painted upon a continuous curved surface so that the viewer is not distracted by corners, seams, or edges. All of these techniques are means of presenting a realistic view of a large scene in a compact space. A photograph or single-eye view of such a diorama can be especially convincing since in this case there is no distraction by the [[binocular disparity|binocular perception]] of depth.

Miniature dioramas may be used to represent scenes from historic events. A typical example of this type are the dioramas to be seen at [[Norway's Resistance Museum]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].

Landscapes built around model railways can also be considered dioramas, even though they often have to compromise scale accuracy for better operating characteristics.

Hobbyists also build dioramas of historical or quasi-historical events using a variety of materials, including [[plastic model]]s of military vehicles, ships or other equipment, along with scale figures and landscaping.

In the 19th and beginning 20th century, building dioramas of sailing ships had been a popular handcraft of mariners. Building a diorama instead of a normal model had the advantage that in the diorama, the model was protected inside the framework and could easily be stowed below the bunk or behind the sea chest. Nowadays, such antique sailing ship dioramas are valuable collectors' items.

One of the largest dioramas ever created{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} was a model of the entire State of [[California]] built for the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] of 1915 and that for a long time was installed in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]'s [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]].

Dioramas are widely used in the [[American educational system]], mostly in elementary and middle schools. They are often made to represent historical events, ecological [[biomes]], cultural scenes, or to visually depict literature. They are usually made from a shoebox and contain a [[trompe-l'œil]] in the background contrasted with two or three-dimensional models in the foreground.

===The Daguerre and Bouton Dioramas===
[[File:Diorama diagram.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Ground-plan of the Diorama Building, London 1823, by A. Pugin and J. Morgan (illustration reproduced from Gernsheim 1968, p 21)]]
The Diorama was a popular entertainment that originated in Paris in 1822. An alternative to the also popular "[[Panorama]]" ([[panoramic painting]]), the Diorama was a theatrical experience viewed by an audience in a highly specialized theatre. As many as 350 patrons would file in to view a landscape painting that would change its appearance both subtly and dramatically. Most would stand, though limited seating was provided. The show lasted 10 to 15 minutes, after which time the entire audience (on a massive turntable) would rotate to view a second painting. Later models of the Diorama theater even held a third painting.

The size of the [[proscenium]] was {{convert|24|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|21|ft|m}} high (7.3 meters x 6.4 meters). Each scene was hand-painted on linen, which was made transparent in selected areas. A series of these multi-layered, linen panels were arranged in a deep, truncated tunnel, then illuminated by sunlight re-directed via skylights, screens, shutters, and colored blinds. Depending on the direction and intensity of the skillfully manipulated light, the scene would appear to change. The effect was so subtle and finely rendered that both critics and the public were astounded, believing they were looking at a natural scene.

The inventors and proprietors of the Diorama were [[Charles Marie Bouton|Charles-Marie Bouton]] (1781– 1853), a Troubador painter who also worked at the Panorama under Pierre Prévost, and [[Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre]] (1787–1851), formerly a decorator, manufacturer of mirrors, painter of Panoramas, and designer and painter of theatrical stage illusions. Daguerre would later co-invent the [[daguerreotype]], the first widely used method of [[photography]].

A second Diorama building in [[Regent's Park]] in London was opened by an association of Englishmen (having a contract to purchase Daguerre's tableaux) in 1823, a year after the debut of Daguerre's Paris original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midley.co.uk/diorama/Diorama_Wood_1_1.htm|title=The Diorama in Great Britain by R.

The show was a popular sensation, and spawned immediate imitations. British artists like [[Clarkson Stanfield]] and [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] produced ever-more elaborate (moving) dioramas through the 1830s; sound effects and even living performers were added. Some "typical diorama effects included moonlit nights, winter snow turning into a summer meadow, rainbows after a storm, illuminated fountains," waterfalls, thunder and lightning, and ringing bells.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Lambourne, ''Victorian Painting'', London, Phaidon Press, 1999; p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; A diorama painted by Daguerre is currently housed in the church of the French town [[Bry-sur-Marne]], where he lived and died.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bry94.fr/sites/bry/fichier/diaporama_diorama.pdf All about Daguerre's diorama in Bry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bry94.fr/bry/2308.htm About the diorama on Bry's official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Gottstein Dioramas ===
Until 1968, Britain boasted a large collection of dioramas. These collections were originally housed in the [[Royal United Services Institute]] Museum, (formerly the [[Banqueting House]]), in [[Whitehall]]. However, when the museum closed, the various exhibits and their 15 known dioramas were distributed to smaller museums throughout [[England]], some ending up in [[Canada]] and elsewhere. These dioramas were the brainchild of the wealthy furrier Otto Gottstein (1892–1951) of [[Leipzig]], a Jewish immigrant from [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's Germany]], who was an avid collector and designer of flat model figures called flats. In 1930, Gottstein's influence is first seen at the Leipzig International Exhibition, along with the dioramas of Hahnemann of [[Kiel]], Biebel of [[Berlin]] and Muller of [[Erfurt]], all displaying their own figures, and those commissioned from such as Ludwig Frank in large diorama form. In 1933, Gottstein left Germany, and in 1935 founded the British Model Soldier Society. Gottstein persuaded designer and painter friends in both [[Germany]] and [[France]] to help in the construction of dioramas depicting notable events in English history. But due to the war, many of the figures arrived in England incomplete. The task of turning Gottstein's ideas into reality fell to his English friends and those friends who had managed to escape from the Continent. Dennis (Denny) C. Stokes, a talented painter and diorama maker in his own right, was responsible for the painting of the backgrounds of all the dioramas, creating a unity seen throughout the whole series. Denny Stokes was given the overall supervision of the fifteen dioramas.

# The Landing of the Romans under [[Julius Caesar]] in 55 B.C.
# The [[Battle of Hastings]].
# The Storming of [[Siege of Acre (1189–91) | Acre]]. (Figures by Muller.)
# The [[Battle of Crecy]]. (Figures by Muller.)
# The [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].
# The [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] reviewing her troops at [[Tilbury]].
# The [[Battle of Marston Moor]].
# The [[Battle of Blenheim]]. (Painted by Douchkine.)
# The [[Battle of Plessey]].
# The [[Battle of Quebec (1759)|Battle of Quebec]]. (Engraved by Krunert of Vienna.)
# The [[Old Guard (France)|Old Guard]] at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].
# The [[Charge of the Light Brigade]].
# The [[Battle of Ulundi]]. (figures by Ochel, and Petrocochino - ''pseudonym of Paul Armont''.)
# The Battle of Fleurs.
# The [[D-Day landings]].

Krunert, Schirmer, Frank, Frauendorf, Maier, Franz Rieche, and Oesterrich were also involved in the manufacture and design of figures for the various dioramas. Krunert (a Viennese), like Gottstein an exile in London, was given the job of engraving for ''‘The Battle of Quebec’''. Unfortunately, the ''‘death of Wolfe’'' was found to be inaccurate and had to be re-designed. The names of the vast majority of painters employed by Gottstein are mostly unknown, most lived and worked on the continent, among them Gustave Kenmow, Leopold Rieche, L. Dunekate, M. Alexandre, A. Ochel, Honey Ray, and, perhaps Gottstein's top painter, Vladimir Douchkine (a Russian émigré who lived in Paris). Douchkine was responsible for painting two figures of the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] on horseback for ''‘The Blenheim Diorama’'', one of which was used, the other, Gottstein being the true collector, was never released.

Denny Stokes painted all the backgrounds of all the dioramas, Herbert Norris, the Historical Costume Designer, whom Dr. J. F. Lovel-Barnes introduced to Gottstein, was responsible for the costume design of the [[Ancient Britons]], the [[Normans]] and [[Saxons]], some of the figures of ''‘The Field of the Cloth of Gold’'' and the [[Elizabethan]] figures for ''‘Queen Elizabeth at Tilbury’''. Dr. J.F. Lovel-Barnes was himself responsible for the ''‘Battle of Blenheim’'' diorama, selecting the figures, and arrangement of the scene. Due to World War II, when flat figures became unavailable, Gottstein completed his ideas by using Greenwood and Ball's 20&amp;nbsp;mm figures. In time, a fifteenth diorama was added, using these 20&amp;nbsp;mm figures, this diorama representing the ''‘D-Day landings’''. When all the dioramas were completed, they were displayed along one wall in the [[Royal United Services Institute]] Museum. When the museum was closed the fifteen dioramas were distributed to various museums and institutions. The greatest number are to be found at the [[Glenbow Museum]], (130-9th Avenue, S. E. Calgary, Alberta, Canada): RE: '''The Landing of the Romans under Julius Caesar in 55 BC', 'The Battle Of Crecy', 'The Battle of Blenheim', 'The Old Guard at Waterloo', 'The Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava'.''
 
The state of these dioramas is one of debate; John Garratt (''The World of Model Soldiers'') claimed in 1968, that the dioramas "appear to have been partially broken up and individual figures have been sold to collectors". According to the Glenbow Institute (Barry Agnew, Curator) "the figures are still in reasonable condition, but the plaster groundwork has suffered considerable deterioration". Unfortunately, there are no photographs available of the dioramas. ''‘The Battle of Hastings’'' diorama was to be found in the Old Town Museum, [[Hastings]], and is still in reasonable condition. It shows the Norman cavalry charging up [[Senlac Hill]] towards the Saxon lines. 
'‘The Storming of Acre’'' is in the Museum of Artillery at the Rotunda, [[Woolwich]]. John Garratt, in the "Encyclopedia of Model Soldiers", states that ''‘The Field of the Cloth of Gold’'' was in the possession of the [[Royal Military School of Music]], [[Kneller Hall]]; however, according to the Curator, the diorama had not been in his possession since 1980, nor is it listed in their Accession Book, so the whereabouts of this diorama is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the British Flat Figure Society'': Issue One – April 1986.

===The Frank Wong dioramas===

[[San Francisco, California]] artist '''Frank Wong''' (born 22 September 1932) created [[Dioramas|miniature dioramas]] that depict the [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco Chinatown]] of his youth during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name = sfchron&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guthrie|first1=Julian|title=Frank Wong recalls life in Chinatown through miniature dioramas|url=http://www.sfgate.com/art/article/Frank-Wong-recalls-life-in-Chinatown-through-5706947.php|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other dioramas ===
[[File:Battle of Midway.jpg|thumb|This photorealistic diorama of the [[Battle of Midway]] was created during World War II on the basis of information then available.]]
Painters of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era like [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] and [[Francis Danby]] were influenced to create large and highly dramatic pictures by the sensational dioramas and panoramas of their day. In one case, the connection between life and diorama art became intensely circular. On 1 February 1829, John Martin's brother Jonathan, known as "Mad Martin," set fire to the roof of [[York Minster]]. Clarkson Stanfield created a diorama re-enactment of the event, which premiered on 20 April of the same year; it employed a "safe fire" via chemical reaction as a special effect. On 27 May, the "safe" fire proved to be less safe than planned: it set a real fire in the painted cloths of the imitation fire, which burned down the theater and all of its dioramas.&lt;ref&gt;Lambourne, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, dioramas remained popular in England, Scotland, and Ireland through most of the 19th century, lasting until 1880.

A small scale version of the diorama called the [[Polyrama Panoptique]] could display images in the home and was marketed from the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10302430&amp;wwwflag=2&amp;imagepos=1 Science &amp; Society Picture Library: the collections of the Science Museum, the National Railway Museum and the National Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural history dioramas==
Natural history dioramas seek to imitate nature and, since their conception in the late 19th century, aim to "nurture a reverence for nature [with its] beauty and grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been described as a means to visually preserve nature as different environments change due to human involvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-v1.amnh.org/exhibitions/dioramas/ Diorama Exhibition at the American Natural History Museum] – Retrieved 4 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; They were extremely popular during the first half of the 20th century, both in the USA and UK, later on giving way to television, film, and new perspectives on science.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carla Yanni, Nature’s Museums: Victorian Science and the Architecture of Display, Princeton Architectural Press, New York, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like historical dioramas, natural history dioramas are a mix of two- and three-dimensional elements. What sets natural history dioramas apart from other categories is the use of taxidermy in addition to the foreground replicas and painted background. The use of taxidermy means that natural history dioramas derive not only from Daguerre's work, but also from that of taxidermists, who were used to preparing specimens for either science or spectacle. It was only with the dioramas' precursors (and, later on, dioramas) that both these objectives merged. Popular diorama precursors were produced by [[Charles Willson Peale]], an artist with an interest in taxidermy, during the early 19th century. To present his specimens, Peale "painted skies and landscapes on the back of cases displaying his taxidermy specimens".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, the [[British Museum]] held an exhibition featuring taxidermy birds set on models of plants.

The first habitat diorama created for a museum was constructed by taxidermist [[Carl Akeley]] for the [[Milwaukee Public Museum]] in 1889,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; where it is still held. Akeley set taxidermy muskrats in a three-dimensional re-creation of their wetland habitat with a realistic painted background. With the support of curator [[Frank M. Chapman]], Akeley designed the popular habitat dioramas featured at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. Combining art with science, these exhibitions were intended to educate the public about the growing need for [[habitat conservation]]. The modern [[AMNH Exhibitions Lab]] is charged with the creation of all dioramas and otherwise immersive environments in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York,. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A predecessor of Akeley, naturalist and taxidermist [[Martha Maxwell]], created a famous habitat diorama for the [[Centennial Exposition|first World's Fair]] in 1876. The complex diorama featured taxidermied animals in realistic action poses, running water, and live prairie dogs.&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Marbury|title=Taxidermy Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoJLBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Artisan|isbn=978-1-57965-558-7|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated this display was the first of its kind [outside of a museum].&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"/&gt; Maxwell's pioneering diorama work is said to have influenced major figures in taxidermy history who entered the field later, such as   Akeley and [[William Temple Hornaday]].&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"/&gt; 

Soon, the concern for accuracy came. Groups of scientists, taxidermists, and artists would go on expeditions to ensure accurate backgrounds and collect specimens,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; though some would be donated by game hunters.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Hanson, Animal Attractions: Nature on Display in American Zoos, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural history dioramas reached the peak of their grandeur with the opening of the [[American Museum of Natural History#African Mammal Hall|Akeley Hall of African Mammals]] in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; which featured large animals, such as elephants, surrounded by even larger scenery.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, various institutions lay different claims to notable dioramas. The Milwaukee Public Museum still displays the world's first diorama, created by Akeley; the [[American Museum of Natural History]], in New York, has what might be the world's largest diorama: a life-size replica of a blue whale; the [[Powell-Cotton Museum]], in Kent, UK, is known for having the world's oldest, unchanged, room-sized diorama, built in 1896.

===Constructing a diorama===

Natural history dioramas consist of 3 parts:

#The painted background
#The foreground
#Taxidermy specimens

Preparations for the background begin on the field, where an artist takes photographs and sketches references pieces. Once back at the museum, the artist has to depict the scenery with as much realism as possible. The challenge lies in the fact that the wall used is curved: this allows the background to surround the display without seams joining different panels. At times the wall also curves upward to meet the light above and form a sky. By having a curved wall, whatever the artist paints will be distorted by perspective; it is the artist's job to paint in such a way that minimises this distortion.

The foreground is created to mimic the ground, plants and other accessories to scenery. The ground, hills, rocks, and large trees are created with wood, wire mesh, and plaster. Smaller trees are either used in their entirety or replicated using casts. Grasses and shrubs can be preserved in solution or dried to then be added to the diorama. Ground debris, such as leaf litter, is collected on site and soaked in wallpaper paste for preservation and presentation in the diorama. Water is simulated using glass or plexiglass with ripples carved on the surface. For a diorama to be successful, the foreground and background must merge, so both artists have to work together.

Taxidermy specimens are usually the centrepiece of dioramas. Since they must entertain, as well as educate, specimens are set in lifelike poses, so as to convey a narrative of an animal's life. Smaller animals are usually made with rubber moulds and painted. Larger animals are prepared by first making a clay sculpture of the animal. This sculpture is made over the actual, posed skeleton of the animal, with reference to moulds and measurements taken on the field. A papier-mâché mannequin is prepared from the clay sculpture and the animal's tanned skin is sewn onto the mannequin. Glass eyes substitute the real ones.

If an animal is large enough, the scaffolding that holds the specimen needs to be incorporated into the foreground design and construction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7639">'''Disability in children's literature''' is a subject that has been the focus of changing attitudes in broader society since the 1970s. The movement to include children and youth with disabilities into mainstream [[society]] has led to new approaches on the part of authors, as well as educators.

In the [[United States]], 10% of the population has a physical, cognitive, mental or health disability, a rate that is consistent worldwide. Disabilities may also include sensory or [[learning disability|learning difficulties]], and may range from severe to mild. The approach of children and youth literature (collectively called "juvenile literature") can have a significant impact on the children reading it, whether they personally have experienced disability or not; literature "has proven to be an agent capable of influencing attitudes and acceptance of impairments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Denman-West|first=Margaret W.|title=Children's Literature: A Guide to Information Sources|year=1998|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781563084485|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{blockquote|Perhaps no group has been as overlooked and inaccurately represented in children's books as individuals with disabilities. Most often they were not included in stories and when they were, many negative [[stereotypes]] prevailed, such as characters who were pitiful or pathetic, evil or superheroes, or a burden and incapable of fully participating in the events of everyday life. Often the difference or disability was the main personality trait emphasized to the reader, not a balance of strengths and weaknesses. Blaska, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salem|first=Linda C.|title=Children's Literature Studies: Cases And Discussions|year=2006|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781591580898|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 1940 to 1970, around 311 books for children were published in the United States that included characters with disabilities. Some of these books romanticized the disability, some were infantilized, while others portrayed the disabled characters as avoiding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salem|first=Linda C.|title=Children's Literature Studies: Cases And Discussions|year=2006|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781591580898|pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the classic children's book ''[[Heidi]]''. It portrays the character Clara as a spoiled and insulated child, who regains the ability to walk after befriending Heidi and overcoming a vague and unexplained [[psychological]] problem, the apparent cause of her physical [[paralysis]], which in reality would be medically unlikely. Another oddity is that the portrayal of [[Blindness|blind]] individuals was in excess of their actual numbers in the real population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salem|first=Linda C.|title=Children's Literature Studies: Cases And Discussions|year=2006|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781591580898|pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blindness was noted as being the most common disability among African-American characters in children's fiction, used as a plot device to represent the ability to see beyond racial prejudices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keith|first=Lois|title=Take up thy bed and walk: death, disability and cure in classic fiction for girls|year=2001|publisher=Women's Press|isbn=9780704346512|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the disability secondary to its significance as a plot device.

Beginning in the 1970s, the [[United States Congress]] passed several Acts to legally protect the right of children and adults with disabilities to be included in schools and the workforce, first with the [[Rehabilitation Act]] of 1973 and then the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] in 1975. In 1986, the [[Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act]] (IDEA) was put into force in the United States, which ended the exclusion of children with disabilities from publicly funded school systems. With the integration of children with disabilities into public schools, educators, librarians and publishers took a new interest in children's literature that dealt with disability in a balanced, accurate, and constructive way. An overall growth in public awareness of disability and its portrayal in media has supported a trend towards more detailed medical descriptions of conditions in juvenile literature. [[Barbara Holland Baskin]] and [[Karen H. Harris]] conducted influential research into the portrayal of disability in children and youth literature in the late 1970s. They published the seminal study ''Notes from a Different Drummer'' (1977), followed by ''More Notes from a Different Drummer'' (1984). Today, disability in juvenile literature is a standard topic included in bibliographies, research, criticism, and review sources. Several bibliographies and studies reviewing fiction and non-fiction have been produced in the years since.

The evolution of the portrayal of disability can be seen in the books written since the 1970s. [[Judy Blume]] shows the experience of a teenage girl diagnosed with [[idiopathic scoliosis]] in ''[[Deenie]]'' (1973). The protagonist, Deenie, faces the challenges brought by having to wear a body brace during her treatment, which impacts her perceptions of herself and those of her family and fellow students. Deenie does not overcome the disability by the end of the story, nor is she defeated by it; the conclusion more realistically shows her continuing to face challenges and learning to adjust to them. 

A trend in current juvenile fiction is the portrayal of characters with "hidden disabilities" that have become more common diagnoses in recent decades. Examples include [[Petra Mathers]]' ''Sophie and Lou'', about extreme shyness that is an emotional and [[social disability]], and [[Caroline Janover]]'s ''The Worst Speller in Jr. High'' (1995) about a boy with [[dyslexia]]. In fiction for older youth, disability has recently been dealt with in complex situations with nuanced techniques such as multiple-perspective narrative; an example is [[Erika Tamar]]'s ''Fair Game'' (1993), about a group of male students who repeatedly sexually assault an intellectually disabled girl at their school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernice E. Cullinan, Diane Goetz Person|title=The Continuum Encyclopedia of Children's Literature|year=2005|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=9780826417787|pages=238–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bibliographer Debra Robertson, who wrote ''Portraying Persons with Disabilities: An Annotated Bibliography of Fiction for Children and Teenagers'' (1992), pointed out in the early 1990s that not every disability has to be a "metaphor for a protagonist's development", and the tendency of writers to romanticize or stigmatize medical conditions in this way is a persistent problem in juvenile literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salem|first=Linda C.|title=Children's Literature Studies: Cases And Discussions|year=2006|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781591580898|pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recent studies have indicated that educators may improve student understanding of disability with "follow-up discussion or activities and stories that portray characters with disabilities accurately, realistically, and positively".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salem|first=Linda C.|title=Children's Literature Studies: Cases And Discussions|year=2006|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781591580898|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Career===

After leaving school and travelling to Mexico, Chaloult returned to Quebec to become a DJ at CIME-FM.  She then became a researcher for television and worked her way up as a programming director, mainly in comedies and varieties. Chaloult had some big successes but has admitted to her share of "flops" which she looks back on for having developed talent.&lt;ref name="PetrowskiAudacieuse" /&gt; She was a variety advisor to TVA.&lt;ref name="CoudePatron"/&gt; Chaloult became director of varieties at [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Radio-Canada]] from June 2004 to June 2009.&lt;ref name="PetrowskiAudacieuse" /&gt;

Chaloult set aside her career for a year to travel abroad and support her husband, [[Pierre Arcand]], who had become Minister of International Relations.  Finding that international diplomacy was not for her, Chaloult returned to Quebec and founded her own production company, La boîte de Prod {{lang-en|Prod Box}}, which she presided over for a year and a half before selling her shares.&lt;ref name="PetrowskiAudacieuse" /&gt;

Chaloult was general manager of programming and new media at [[Télé-Québec]] from January 2012 to December 2014. During her stay at Télé-Québec, she developed ''{{Interlanguage link|Les Bobos|fr|Les Bobos (série télévisée)}}'', ''Deux hommes en or'', ''[[SNL Québec]]'' and ''125, Marie-Anne''.&lt;ref name="PilonQuitte" /&gt; According to Columnist Nathalie Petrowski, Chaloult revived the public broadcaster by taking risks and launching daring and diverse programming.&lt;ref name="PetrowskiAudacieuse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBCAppointed"/&gt;

Chaloult was appointed Executive Director of Television for Radio-Canada,&lt;ref name="CBCAppointed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RadioCanadaNommee" /&gt; taking office in January 2015.&lt;ref name="PowellReturns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BuchingerEncore"/&gt;

In 2016 Chaloult created a television cultural strategy branch at Radio-Canada to develop an action plan that better reflects the diversity of the broadcaster's audience.&lt;ref name="LExpressStrategy"/&gt; In 2017 Chaloult was honoured with a tribute at the Women's Film, Television and Digital Media Gala.&lt;ref name="BernardDiversity"/&gt;

===Personal Life===

Dominique Chaloult is the spouse of {{Abbr|MNA|Member of National Assembly of Quebec}} [[Pierre Arcand]], who had been her boss at CIME-FM.  She is the daughter of press secretary Francine Chaloult, sister of author Rafaële Germain and sister-in-law of [[Paul Arcand]].&lt;ref name="PetrowskiAudacieuse" /&gt; Women in her family have been leaders in media:  her mother, Francine Chaloult, was the first female press secretary; her mother-in-law, Colette Chabot, was a journalist and founded CIME 99.5, the first FM radio station in the Laurentians; and her aunt, {{Interlanguage link|Suzanne Lévesque|fr}}, hosted programmes on radio and television.  Dominique Chaloult owns an equestrian centre and has a great passion for horses.&lt;ref name="PetrowskiAudacieuse" /&gt;

The '''East Tennessee Community Design Center''', founded in 1970, is an organization who offers design and planning assistance to communities and organizations throughout 16 counties of [[East Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://knoxvilleisurf.com/local-news-knoxville/780.html |title=East Tennessee Community Design Center receives grant &amp;#124; Knoxville, TN - Local, Free, Knoxville News |publisher=Knoxvilleisurf.com |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2012-11-18 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130127122914/http://knoxvilleisurf.com/local-news-knoxville/780.html |archivedate=2013-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Community Design Center offers its services through the pro bono contributions of area architects, landscape architects, planners and other professionals. It is located in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] and is registered as a nonprofit corporation chartered as a [[501(c)(3)]] tax-exempt organization under [[IRS]] regulations.

== History ==
The Community Design Center has been in existence since 1969, when [[Bruce McCarty]], then the President of the local chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA), visited the community design center in Philadelphia. Bruce returned to "pitch the idea" to some 40 local professionals that Knoxville too was in need of a community design center. McCarty founded the ETCDC to offer technical expertise to non-profit organizations.  Dozens of professional architects and students from the University of Tennessee donate their time and talent in order to assist charitable groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbir.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=124509 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209025501/http://www.wbir.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=124509 |archive-date=2013-02-09 |title=East Tennessee Community Design Center celebrates 40 years |publisher=wbir.com |date=2010-06-17 |accessdate=2012-11-18|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning, the Community Design Center was a part of a national movement instigated by the [[American Institute of Architects]] and the [[National Urban League]]. [[Bruce McCarty]] was the local instigator. Bruce heard that architects, planners, and other designers in other cities were helping change communities by donating their professional services to low-income communities and groups. Bruce took his son, Doug, and other architecture students to see how it was being done in Philadelphia, location of one of the first Community Design Centers. Back home in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], Bruce led a local coalition of planners, community organizers, social workers, architects, and landscape architects in formation of the East Tennessee Community Design Center. On July 1, 1970 the center was incorporated for one purpose, to bring professional design and planning services to non-profit groups and agencies that lack the resources to pay for the service. By 1971, there were at least 83 such programs across the country.

The first project of the Community Design Center was a neighborhood plan for [[Fort Sanders (Knoxville neighborhood)|Fort Sanders]], funded through the East Tennessee Development District, using a Housing and Urban Development grant intended to assist grassroots planning. Members of the first Board of Directors, with their own hands, rehabilitated the Design Center's historic home in Knoxville. These early board members also organized a process for accepting and assisting new projects, provided planning and design assistance to the Fort Sanders study, and recruited their colleagues to help with the additional project requests that began to pour in.

== Mission ==
The mission statement given by the East Tennessee Community Design Center is "to make East Tennessee a better place to live and work by bringing professional design and planning assistance to community groups and non-profit organizations."&lt;ref name="East Tennessee Community Design Center"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communitydc.org/about/ |title=Community Design Center &amp;#124; East Tennessee Community Design Center &amp;#124; Architecture &amp;#124; Landscaping &amp;#124; Planning &amp;#124; Community Development &amp;#124; Nonprofit &amp;#124; ETCDC &amp;#124; Design &amp;#124; Knoxville - About &amp;#124; Community Design Center |publisher=Communitydc.org |accessdate=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Executive Directors ==
* Wayne Blasius (2015-current)
* Mary Linda Schwarzbart (2013-2015)
* John C. Merino (2013-2013)
* David Watson (2002–2013)
* Tim Ledford (1996–2001)
* Terry Shupp (1995–1996)
* Annette Anderson (1973–1995)
* Bill Oliphant (1971–1973)
* Ed Dusek (1970–1971)
&lt;br&gt;
The first Coordinator of the Community Design Center was Ed Dusek, an architect from [[Nashville, Tennessee]], who led the Center through the completion of the Fort Sanders plan. His successor was landscape architect Bill Oliphant, one of the Center's founders.  Oliphant brought the first VISTA's to the Center in 1972. Those "Knoxville Nine" were the first of many VISTA's who served East Tennessee and their own career development by their work on Community Design Center projects. The Community Design Center hosted the longest lasting [[Americorps VISTA]] program in the country. Annette Anderson began her 22 year tenure as the Coordinator of the Center in 1973 and remained the director until 1995.

=== Staff ===
The center has an all-volunteer board of directors and a small staff of two full-time personnel, the Executive Director and the Assistant to the Director. Part-time staff includes an administrative assistant, a Studio Director and a DesignWorks Program coordinator, along with a variable number of paid students primarily from [[The University of Tennessee]] College of Architecture and Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metropulse.com/news/2010/nov/03/east-tennessee-community-design-center-marks-40-ye/ |title=East Tennessee Community Design Center Marks 40 years |publisher=Metro Pulse |date=2010-11-03 |accessdate=2012-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110060006/http://www.metropulse.com/news/2010/nov/03/east-tennessee-community-design-center-marks-40-ye/ |archivedate=November 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==
The majority of assistance provided by the East Tennessee Community Design Center is architectural and engineering services to nonprofit groups whose projects serve the community at large. Early design support leads to complete projects. The main types of projects that the staff works are community facilities, long range visioning and planning, landscaping, parks and playgrounds, as well as rehabilitation and reuse.

Some of the services provided are:
* Introducing the client to Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED)
* Introducing the client to sustainable design
* Anticipating project implementation costs
* Evaluating existing building conditions
* Identifying health, safety, and accessibility issues
* Establishing project implementation priorities
* Understanding space needs of the client and transforming those needs into a building design
* Exploring design options
* Containing project costs through design alternatives
* Graphically illustrate how the project will look when construction or renovation is complete &lt;ref name="East Tennessee Community Design Center"/&gt;

== Funding ==
Funding to sustain the operations is solely from competitive grants and donations from corporate sponsors and individuals in the community. The East Tennessee Community Design Center does request a donation from their clients as well, which is used to help offset the cost associated with providing the design assistance. Funding for preliminary design services is hard to find. The Design Center fills this gap by providing conceptual only architectural and engineering services to community groups and nonprofit organizations early in the project development process.&lt;ref name="East Tennessee Community Design Center"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5611">'''Ecovention''' was a term invented by Amy Lipton and [[Sue Spaid]] in 1999 to refer to an [[ecological art]] intervention in environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eyebeam.org/ecovention-current-art-to-transform-ecologies Eyebeam "Current Art to Transform Ecologies."&lt;/ref&gt; The Ecovention movement in art is associated with [[land art]], earthworks, and [[environmental art]], and [[landscape architecture]], but remains its own distinct category. Many ecoventions bear tendencies similar to public works projects such as sewage and waste-water treatment plants, public gardens, landfills, mines, and sustainable building projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://greenmuseum.org/c/ecovention/sect1.html#landart Greenmuseum.org Ecoventions&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ‘Ecovention’ appears by the composition of the terms 'ecology' and 'innovation' or 'intervention'. The intention was to concrete a kind of art that alludes to the interventions that artists were made in degraded natural territories, pretending to generate a public consciousness, showing the existence of solutions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MARÍN RUIZ|first1=Carmen|title=‘Arte medioambiental y ecología. Elementos para una reflexión crítica.’|date=2014|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The fact of restoring make the artists enter in a collaboration process with the nature in a social way. They help to generate a new paradigm teaching how art could help the society not only in a social or political criticism, but getting directly involved in the world. They are responsible for extending the various environmental principles and practices to the community. 

Artists will focus on various aspects like: biological, cultural, political or historical. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecovention: current art to transform ecologies.|url=http://greenmuseum.org/c/ecovention/sect11.html|website=Greenmuseum}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, different professionals work that are fundamental; architects, botanists, zoologists, engineers, ecologists... all based on the imaginative idea of an artist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MARÍN RUIZ|first1=Carmen|title=‘Arte medioambiental y ecología. Elementos para una reflexión crítica.’|date=2014|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4.
Activism, the re-evaluation of territories, the study of diversity and the recovery of spaces will be some of its main characteristics. To carry them out, they use new techniques in order to transform that local ecology in order to reestablish natural resources and stabilize environments. His works have as a common goal to motivate the viewer to visit these spaces generating awareness and in turn encourage more interventions. 


Artists associated with ecovention include: [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Mel Chin]], [[Agnes Denes]], Helen and Newton Harrison, Ocean Earth, [[Robert Smithson]], Alan Sonfist, and [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], among others.

==Exhibitions==
''Ecovention'' is also the title of a 2002 exhibition at the ''Cincinnati [[Contemporary Arts Center]]'' in [[Ohio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ground works : environmental collaboration in contemporary art.|date=2005|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|location=Pittsburgh, PA|isbn=978-0-9772053-1-8|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffYQeG4MrRAC&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=%22Ecovention%22%20lipton&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the title of exhibition catalog, joint published with the Greenmuseum.&lt;ref&gt;http://greenmuseum.org/c/ecovention/intro_frame.html Greenmuseum.org. Contemporary Arts Center.&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered the definitive text on ecological art for several years and the only text available for teaching the topic at the college and University level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=editor|first=Kim Kennedy White, editor ; Leslie A.

There is a new exhibition, Ecovention Europe, planned to open in the Fall of 2017. The show is also curated by Sue Spaid, and will feature a new text furthering the conversation around what an "Ecovention" is. The show will be held at the Museum De Domijnen in Sittard, Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dedomijnen.nl/exposities/exposities-hedendaagse-kunst/ecovention-europe/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Escapism''' is the avoidance of unpleasant, boring, arduous, scary, or banal aspects of [[Everyday life|daily life]].&lt;ref&gt;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/escapism&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used as a term to define the actions people take to help relieve persistent feelings of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or general [[sadness]].

==Perceptions==
Entire industries have sprung up to foster a growing tendency of people to remove themselves from the rigors of daily life – especially into the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;G. Kainer, ''Grace and the Great Controversy'' (2010) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Many activities that are normal parts of a healthy existence (e.g., eating, sleeping, exercise, sexual activity) can also become avenues of escapism when taken to extremes or out of proper context; and as a result the word "escapism" often carries a negative connotation, suggesting that escapists are unhappy, with an inability or unwillingness to connect meaningfully with the world and to take necessary action.&lt;ref&gt;D. Baggett et al, ''C. S. Lewis as Philosopher'' (2009) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the [[OED]] defined escapism as "The tendency to seek, or the practice of seeking, distraction from what normally has to be endured".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in T. A. Shipley, ''The Road to Middle-Earth'' (1992) p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many challenge the idea that escapism is fundamentally and exclusively negative. [[C. S. Lewis]] was fond of humorously remarking that the usual enemies of escape were jailers;&lt;ref&gt;G. Kainer, ''Grace and the Great Controversy'' (2010) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and considered that used in moderation escapism could serve both to refresh and to expand the imaginative powers.&lt;ref&gt;D. Baggett et al, ''C. S. Lewis as Philosopher'' (2009) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] argued for escapism in fantasy literature as the creative expression of reality within a secondary (imaginative) world, (but also emphasised that they required an element of horror in them, if they were not to be 'mere escapism').&lt;ref&gt;T. F. Nicolay, ''Tolkien and the Modernists'' (2014) p. 79 and p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terry Pratchett]] considered that the twentieth century had seen the development over time of a more positive view of escapist literature.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Pratchett &amp; Stephen Briggs, ''The Discworld Companion'' (2012) p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from literature, [[music]] has been seen and valued as an artistic medium of escape, too.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Dorschel]], ''Der Welt abhanden kommen. Über musikalischen Eskapismus''. In: ''Merkur'' 66 (2012), no. 2, pp. 135–142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological escapes==
[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] considered a quota of escapist [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] a necessary element in the life of humans: "[T]hey cannot subsist on the scanty satisfaction they can extort from reality. 'We simply cannot do without auxiliary constructions', [[Theodor Fontane]] once said".&lt;ref&gt;S, Freud, ''Introductory lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL1) p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; His followers saw rest and wish fulfilment (in small measures) as useful tools in adjusting to traumatic upset;&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946), p. 554&lt;/ref&gt; while later psychologists have highlighted the role of vicarious distractions in shifting unwanted [[Mood (psychology)|moods]], especially anger and sadness.&lt;ref&gt;D. Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1996) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if permanent residence is taken up in some such [[John Steiner (psychoanalyst)#Psychic retreat|psychic retreats]], the results will often be negative and even pathological.&lt;ref&gt;R. Britton, ''Belief and Imagination'' (2003) p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs cause some forms of escapism which can occur when certain mind-altering drugs are taken which make the participant forget the reality of where they are or what they are meant to be doing.

==Escapist societies==
Some social critics warn of attempts by the powers that control society to provide means of escapism instead of actually bettering the condition of the people – what [[Juvenal]] called “bread and the [[Gladiatorial games|games]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, ''The Sixteen Satires'' (1982) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Escapist societies appear often in literature. ''[[The Time Machine]]'' depicts the Eloi, a lackadaisical, insouciant race of the future, and the horror their happy lifestyle belies. The novel subtly criticizes [[capitalism]], or at least classism, as a means of escape. Escapist societies are common in dystopian novels; for example, in the ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' society, television and "seashell radios" are used to escape a life with strict regulations and the threat of a forthcoming war. In science fiction media escapism is often depicted as an extension of social evolution, as society becomes detached from physical reality and processing into a virtual one, examples include the virtual world of Oz in the 2009 Japanese animated science fiction anime ''[[Summer Wars]]'' and the game "Society" in the 2009 American science fiction film ''[[Gamer (2009 film)|Gamer]]'', a play on the real-life [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] game ''[[Second Life]]''. Other escapist societies in literature include ''The Reality Bug'' by D. J. McHale, where an entire civilization leaves their world in ruin while they 'jump' into their perfect realities. The aim of the anti hero becomes a quest to make their realities seemingly less perfect in order to regain control over their dying planet.

Social philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]] wrote that utopias and images of fulfilment, however regressive they might be, also included an impetus for a radical social change. According to Bloch, social justice could not be realized without seeing things fundamentally differently. Something that is mere "daydreaming" or "escapism" from the viewpoint of a technological-rational society might be a seed for a new and more humane social order, as it can be seen as an "immature, but honest substitute for revolution".

==Escape scale==

The Norwegian psychologist Frode Stenseng has presented a dualistic model of escapism in relation to different types of activity engagements. He discusses the paradox that the flow state ([[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi]]) resembles psychological states obtainable through actions such as drug abuse, sexual masochism, and suicide ideation ([[Roy Baumeister|Baumeister]]). Accordingly, he deduces that the state of escape can have both positive and negative meanings and outcomes. Stenseng argues that there exist two forms of escapism with different affective outcomes dependent on the motivational focus that lies behind the immersion in the activity. Escapism in the form of self-suppression stems from motives to run away from unpleasant thoughts, self-perceptions, and emotions, whereas self-expansion stems from motives to gain positive experiences through the activity and to discover new aspects of self. Stenseng has developed the "escape scale" to measure self-suppression and self-expansion in people´s favorite activities, such as sports, arts, and gaming. Empirical investigations of the model have shown that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stenseng|first1=Frode|last2=Rise|first2=Jostein|last3=Kraft|first3=Pål|title=Activity Engagement as Escape from Self: The Role of Self-Suppression and Self-Expansion|journal=Leisure Sciences: An Interdisciplinary Journal|date=2012|volume=34|issue=1|pages=19–38|doi=10.1080/01490400.2012.633849|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490400.2012.633849}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the two dimensions are distinctively different with regard to affective outcomes 
* some individuals are more prone to engage through one type of escapism 
* situational levels of well-being affect the type of escapism that becomes dominant at a specific time

==During the Great Depression== 
[[Alan Brinkley]], author of ''Culture and Politics in the Great Depression'', presents how escapism became the new trend for dealing with the hardships created by [[Great Depression|the stock market crash in 1929]]: magazines, radio and movies, all were aimed to help people mentally escape from the mass poverty and economic downturn. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, which became hugely popular during the 1930s, was said to have pictures that give "no indication that there was such a thing as depression; most of the pictures are of bathing beauties and ship launchings and building projects and sports heroes – of almost anything but poverty and unemployment”. Famous director [[Preston Sturges]] aimed to validate this notion by creating a film called ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]''. The film ends with a group of poor destitute men in jail watching a comedic [[Mickey Mouse]] [[cartoon]] that ultimately lifts their spirits. Sturges aims to point out how "foolish and vain and self-indulgent" it would be to make a film about suffering. Therefore, movies of the time more often than not focused on comedic plot lines that distanced people emotionally from the horrors that were occurring all around them. These films "consciously, deliberately set out to divert people from their problems", but it also diverted them from the problems of those around them.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, Alan. Culture and Politics in the Great Depression. Waco, Tx: Markham Press Fund, 1999. http://www.uvm.edu/~pblackme/Brinkley.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hannah Baker''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] created by American author [[Jay Asher]]. She is the subject of his 2007 [[young adult fiction]] mystery novel ''[[Thirteen Reasons Why]]'', which was adapted by the media company [[Netflix]] as ''[[13 Reasons Why]]''. Hannah is introduced as a [[sophomore]] at the fictional Liberty High School; she struggles to adjust to living in an unsympathetic school environment. In the television series, Hannah is portrayed by Australian actress [[Katherine Langford]], who returned for the show's second season, which was released in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/13-reasons-two-new-cast-10396457 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226130848/http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/13-reasons-two-new-cast-10396457 |archivedate=December 26, 2017 |df=mdy-all }} "When is 13 Reasons Why season 2? Release date, spoilers, new cast and whether Hannah will return"&lt;/ref&gt;

''13 Reasons Why'' received largely positive, though also polarizing, reviews from critics and audiences. Although critics were divided on several aspects of the show, in particular how it handled mental health and its depictions of rape and suicide, they praised Langford's performance. Langford later received a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance. She was catapulted to worldwide attention and was variously called "a revelation",&lt;ref name="gold derby"&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniel|last=Montgomery|url=https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/katherine-langford-13-reasons-why-emmy-awards/|title=Emmy spotlight: Newcomer Katherine Langford (’13 Reasons Why’) is a revelation as a suicidal teen|website=[[Gold Derby Awards]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=April 10, 2017|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "believable and raw",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Liz Shannon|last=Miller|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/03/13-reasons-why-review-netflix-suicide-1201799484/|title=’13 Reasons Why’ Review: Netflix Brings a Brutally Adult Edge to A Tale of Teen Suicide|website=[[Indiewire]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=March 31, 2017|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "magnetic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Sophie|last=Gilbert|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/13-reasons-why-season-two-netflix/560426/|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|publisher=[[Emerson Collective]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=May 17, 2018|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Montgomery of the [[Gold Derby Awards|Gold Derby]] said she was an early frontrunner for an [[Emmy Award]] nomination.&lt;ref name="gold derby"/&gt;

==Storyline (television series)==
At the beginning of the series, 17-year-old schoolgirl Hannah Baker commits suicide by slitting her wrists—in the novel she swallows and overdoses on pills. Her school locker becomes a memorial adorned with students' letters and her pictures. On his doorstep, Hannah's friend [[Clay Jensen]] finds a box containing [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette tapes]] containing a recording of Hannah talking about the 13 reasons for her suicide. 
Clay listens to the first tape, on which Hannah narrates the events that led to her suicide. She talks about her first kiss with Justin Foley, who later spreads a rumour about their encounter. Justin's friend [[Bryce Walker]] forwards Hannah's private photograph from his phone to everyone at school, further embarrassing her. Clay recalls being rude to Hannah about her leaked photograph. Each subsequent tape reveals the thirteen reasons she killed herself. Hannah warns listeners to follow certain rules; everyone mentioned on the tapes must listen to the complete set then pass it along to the next person addressed. If they fail to do so, the second set of tapes, held by personal friend Tony, who is not on the tapes, will be released. Clay, who was secretly in love with Hannah, reminisces about the time he spent with her. He finds listening to Hannah's story difficult, but his friend Tony finds him and reveals he helped Hannah record the tapes and knows Clay is mentioned on them. He warns Clay things will go wrong if he does not obey the tapes.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Shirlley|last=Li|title=Episode 1: "Tape 1, Side A"|url=http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=March 31, 2017|accessdate=April 12, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413074236/http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/|archivedate=April 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the B side of the first tape, Hannah talks about her friendship with Jessica Davis and Alex Standall, who later start dating and stop hanging out with Hannah. When Alex breaks up with Jessica, she blames Hannah for the breakup and slaps her in public.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite web|first=Shirlley|last=Li|title=Episode 2: "Tape 1, Side B"|url=http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/2/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=March 31, 2017|accessdate=April 12, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413073512/http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/2/|archivedate=April 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex is the subject of the A side of the second tape. In the present, Hannah's mother, Olivia Baker, finds the "hot or not" list, on which Hannah was voted as the "best ass", at her house, leading her to believe her daughter was being bullied. She seeks the school principal's help. Clay turns to Alex for answers and reveals that Alex made the list to get back at Jessica, who refused to have sex with him. What Alex did not know, is that his list has led to Hannah being touched by unknown boys sexually and finally being raped by Bryce.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite web|last=Li|first=Shirlley|title=Episode 3: "Tape 2, Side A"|url=http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/3/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=new York City|date=March 31, 2017|accessdate=April 12, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413073811/http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/3/|archivedate=April 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Clay progresses through the tapes, he encounters the other people mentioned on Hannah's recordings. He discovers everyone on the tapes either took advantage of Hannah or abandoned her. Tyler Down, the school photographer, stalks Hannah and distributes a photograph of her and her only friend Courtney Crimsen kissing.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Ruth|last=Kinane|title=Episode 4: "Tape 2, Side B"|url=http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/4/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=March 31, 2017|accessdate=April 15, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415203801/http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/4/|archivedate=April 15, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afraid of her classmates discovering that she is a [[lesbian]], Courtney spreads a rumor that the girls in the leaked photos are Hannah and Laura, another lesbian classmate, and adds to the rumor about Hannah and Justin.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{cite web|first=Ruth|last=Kinane|title=Episode 5: "Tape 3, Side A"|url=http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/5/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|accessdate=15 April 2017|date=31 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415203352/http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/5/|archivedate=April 15, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus Cole humiliates Hannah in public,&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite web|first=Ruth|last=Kinane|title=Episode 6: "Tape 3, Side B"|url=http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/6/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=March 31, 2017|accessdate=April 15, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415205615/http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/6/|archivedate=April 15, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zach Dempsey steals her class notes as revenge for her rejecting him.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Isabella|last=Biedenharn|title=Episode 7: "Tape 4, Side A"|url=http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/7/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=March 31, 2017|accessdate=April 15, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415203907/http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/7/|archivedate=April 15, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hannah later joins a poetry club where she meets the student Ryan Shaver, who publishes her personal poem against her wishes in his school magazine "Lost'n Found".&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;{{cite web|last=Biedenharn|first=Isabella|title=Episode 8: "Tape 4, Side B"|url=http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/8/|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=15 April 2017|date=31 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415205616/http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/8/|archivedate=April 15, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;In the present day, Tony confides in Clay about the night of Hannah's death. Hannah attends a party at Jessica's house; while hiding in Jessica's room, Hannah watches Bryce rape a drunk, unconscious Jessica, with Justin's complicity.&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Isabella|last=Biedenharn|title=Episode 9: "Tape 5, Side A"|url=http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/9/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=March 31, 2017|accessdate=April 15, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415203922/http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/9/|archivedate=April 15, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah is afraid to tell anyone and decides to leave. Sheri Holland, the subject of the next tape, offers Hannah a ride home but abandons her after crashing her car into a stop sign and refusing to report it, which later leads to the death of Jeff Atkins.&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Isabella|last=Biedenharn|title=Episode 10: "Tape 5, Side B"|url=http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/10/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=March 31, 2017|accessdate=April 15, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415203611/http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/10/|archivedate=April 15, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Clay struggles to continue listening to Hannah's recordings, thinking he has let her down. He decides to return the tapes to Tony, who tells him he is the subject of the next tape. Clay hesitates to listen to "his" tape, but decides to continue.&lt;ref name="eleven"&gt;{{cite web|last=Highfill|first=Samantha|title=Episode 11: "Tape 6, Side A"|url=http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/11/|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=15 April 2017|date=31 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415203306/http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/11/|archivedate=April 15, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hannah continues to talk about the night of Jessica's party. Hoping for a fresh start to the school year, she wants to admit to her feelings for Clay. The two spend most of the time together at the party and kiss in Jessica's room. Hannah is overwhelmed by the memories of her previous encounters with boys at school, which include Justin, Marcus and Zach. She screams at Clay and asks him to leave. Thinking he has provoked Hannah's breakdown, Clay leaves her alone in the room. Hannah witnesses Bryce raping Jessica. Hannah says though Clay does not deserve to be on the tapes, she could not have told her story without talking about him.

On the B side of tape 6, Hannah talks of "the most difficult day" of her life.In the present day, Olivia finds a list with all the names of the people on the tapes, but does not know the meaning behind them. The Bakers decide to file a lawsuit against the school and everyone on the list is subpoenaed. After accidentally losing her parent's deposits, which were supposed to go to the bank, Hannah's parents angrily confront her, later that night, after feeling extremely depressed and a burden to everyone around her, she goes to a party at Bryce's house, after being peer pressured to join in the hot tub, Hannah unfortunately finds herself alone with Bryce, who proceeds to rape her. After returning home Hannah starts recalling how her life came to this point, and after writing down a list of the people who hurt her, she decides that "No one will hurt her again". .&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;{{cite web|last=Highfill|first=Samantha|title=Episode 12: "Tape 6, Side B"|url=http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/12/|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=15 April 2017|date=31 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415205618/http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/12/|archivedate=April 15, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the final tape, Hannah recalls the day of her suicide. She records 12 tapes, starting with Jessica, and ending with Bryce, after recording the tapes, Hannah said she felt "Something shift", and decides to get help and give life one more try. She visits school counselor Mr. Porter and asks for his help, and tells him about the rape but refuses to disclose her rapist's identity, after failing to extract the boy's name, Mr. Porter tells her to "Move on". Hannah leaves his office, in hopes of him following her, he doesn't.  Hannah drops off her uniform on the counter at the Crestmont before delivering the tapes to Tony. Hannah returns home, cleans her room and put on old clothing, she fills up her bathtub and slits her wrists with a razor blade. Hannah dies of blood loss and is found by her parents, who attempt to save her by calling 911 but are too late.&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Highfill|first=Samantha|title=Episode 13: "Tape 7, Side A"|url=http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/13/|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=15 April 2017|date=31 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415204029/http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/13/|archivedate=April 15, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's director [[Tom McCarthy (director)|Tom McCarthy]], script-writer Brian Yorkey, and the executive producer [[Selena Gomez]] selected Langford following a [[Skype]] audition. Yorkey called the casting process especially hard because of the extra effort needed to match the actor with the visions of the novel's readers. Speaking with James Gill of the ''[[Radio Times]]'', he expressed his satisfaction on the casting of Langford and [[Dylan Minnette]] as the leading duo, and said, "It was well worth it, because it was about finding two people who could not only portray Hannah and Clay but really understand at a deep level what their journey is".&lt;ref name="gill"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gill|first1=James|title=Who is 13 Reasons Why star Katherine Langford?

'''''Le Dépiquage des Moissons''''', also known as '''''Harvest Threshing''''', and '''''The Harvesters''''', is an immense oil painting created in 1912 by the French artist, theorist and writer [[Albert Gleizes]] (1881–1953). It was first revealed to the general public at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], ''Galerie La Boétie'' in Paris, October 1912 (no. 43). This work, along with ''La Ville de Paris'' (''City of Paris'') by [[Robert Delaunay]], is the largest and most ambitious [[Cubism|Cubist]] painting undertaken during the pre-War Cubist period. Formerly in the collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, this monumental painting by Gleizes is exhibited at the [[National Museum of Western Art]], in Tokyo, Japan.

==Description==
The work is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 269 x 353&amp;nbsp;cm (106 x 138 in), signed and dated lower right, Gleizes, 1912. "''Harvest Threshing''", wrote curator and art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]] for the Gleizes Guggenheim Retrospective in 1964, "summarizes Gleizes' interest in presenting an epic panorama of mountains, valleys, clouds and smoke, towns, workers and wheat, a simultaneous celebration of the harvest, nature and man in idealistic harmony." Gleizes' painting, as [[Henri Le Fauconnier]]'s ''Abundance'', likely takes its theme from the social and synthetic program of the [[Abbaye de Créteil]], and too, from the poem of [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]], ''La Montagne, Poèmes légendaires'', part 5 of ''La Terrestre Tragedie'' (Paris, Mercure de France, 1908): ''Les Moissonneurs dans les Epis, armes de faux et de faucilles...'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;49–56).&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R.

While the [[still-life]] and [[nude]] are common themes of pre-[[World War I]] Cubism, the work of Gleizes is characterized by ambitious subjects:&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke 2012"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/Du%20Cubisme/contents Peter Brooke, ''On "Cubism" in context'', 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; the harvest, the hunt, the city, and, later, ''Broadway'' in New York City, and the ''Brooklyn Bridge'' (1915, Guggenheim, New York), one of his most abstract paintings of this period.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=2191 Daniel Robbins, MoMA, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Gleizes took this, according to Peter Brooke, as symbolic of the need to express the whole vast drama, the collection of unprecedented sensations of modern life.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke 2012" /&gt;
''Harvest Threshing'' represents a big subject, rich in plastic possibilities. The interest of the painting resides in its rich and complex fabric of interwoven latticework, with 'the institution of relations between straight lines and curves' or the 'thousand surprises of fire and of shadow' proposed in ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' (co-authored with [[Jean Metzinger]] in 1912). The subject matter is entirely, as Le Fauconnier and Gleizes himself says, 'a pretext'. A pencil transcription done to scale by Geneviève Dalban, as Peter Brooke points out, reveals the greatness of the construction. "The 'duration' that has been so much talked about is entirely a matter of the length of time that can be spent looking at it, as one thing leads to another, in and out and round about, in an endless visual dance. It is a mark of the failure of the Cubist revolution – its hi-jacking by the champions of the subject – that nearly one hundred years later there are writers on art who can see in such a picture only peasants, a church tower, a rustic meal, mountains, clouds..."&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke 2012" /&gt;

In this painting can be observed the summing up of all present in the art of [[Georges Seurat]]: "the line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an assessable abstract value", it represented the furthest extension of [[Paul Cézanne]]'s preoccupations: his will to deconstruct, his revolt against imitation and refusal of Renaissance perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://Cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com Alex Mittelmannn, ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much as that of ''[[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses]]'' and ''[[Man on a Balcony (Gleizes)|Man on a Balcony (Portrait of Dr. Théo Morinaud)]]'' painted the same year, the subject matter of ''Harvest Threshing''—a semi-urban landscape that possesses both rural and semi-industrial components, juxtaposing sharply contrasting elements of both traditional and modern life—is derived from an unsentimental observation of the world.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke 2012" /&gt; On the one hand the artist makes illusion to the traditional process of [[threshing]]—a step in grain preparation after [[harvest]]ing and before [[winnowing]], now mostly done by machine—and on the other, the artist includes elements from a society in the process of inexorable industrialization. Yet the compositional relationships between the two are formally resolved. The representation of this transition between classical tradition and contemporary life was noticeably of interest to Gleizes, as it was to other artists of the [[Section d'Or]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

"The organic process of life and civilization, moving irresistibly toward harmonious interaction," wrote [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Robbins]], "was the subject of Gleizes' art." It was treated neither as a "confined symbolic allegory nor as a cultural background indicated by specific real appearance, but was instead presented in concrete and precise terms. Gleizes' ''Harvest Threshing'', the masterpiece of the Section d'Or (no. 34), is not merely an anecdote in a scene. Rather, it is a multiple panorama celebrating the worker, his material life and his collective activity in securing that life on a permanently changing land. Gleizes confronts us not with one action or place, but with many: not with one time, but with past and future as well as present."(Robbins, 1964)&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

==In contrast to Picasso and Braque==
[[File:Braque fruitdish glass.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[Georges Braque]], ''Fruitdish and Glass'', [[papier collé]] and charcoal on paper, 1912]]
[[File:L'Aveyron, Decazeville, 1918, Les Usines, CPA.jpg|thumb|right|L'Aveyron, Decazeville, 1918, Les Usines, postcard]]
Gleizes had no intention of analyzing and describing neutral objects from daily life; a bowl of fruit, a pipe, violin or guitar. His 'empathetic' consciousness and complex idealistic concepts of the world led him to portray—rather than 'mundane' objects—subjects of vast proportion, of provocative social and cultural significance. For Gleizes, consciousness and reality could meet and reconcile on the surface of the canvas. There is no period that corresponds closely to the analytic Cubism developed by Picasso and Braque in the work of Gleizes, as of Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and [[Fernand Léger|Léger]]. The ''iconography'' of these artists, in contrast to that of Picasso and Braque, helps elucidate the reasons. At the same time, iconography explains how Gleizes and Delaunay were to become abstract painters, theoretically closer to  [[Wassily Kandinsky]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] than to Picasso, Braque or even [[Juan Gris|Gris]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The intention of Gleizes had been to reconstitute and synthesize the real-world according to his own consciousness. Important factors in this process were the relationships and interactions between volumes to convey solidity, structure, weight, placement. Also important was a principal lessons of Cézanne: the indivisibility of form and color; a change in one would alter the other.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Unlike Picasso and Braque, the work of Gleizes always involved the synthetic treatment of broad subjects, each section of canvas receiving equal attention. As a consequence, almost a year after the completion of ''The Harvesters'', Gleizes would develop compositional innovations: broad tilting planes that provide a transition from the outer rectangles to the rotating forms at the core of the work.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Gleizes was aware of the differences between his own interests and those of Picasso and Braque. He wrote an article after seeing Picasso's work for the first time (in 1911). After quoting Apollinaire about returning to the principles of structure, color and inspiration, he wrote that the "valuable [precieuses] indications of Picasso and Braque, in spite of everything, did not depart from an impressionism of form which, nevertheless, they opposed (an impressionism of) color."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

==''Du "Cubisme"''==

Exhibited at Salon d'Automne, Paris, 1912, [[Armory show]], New York, Chicago, Boston, 1913. The setting: an urban backdrop of bridge-girders, smokestacks and train tracks viewed from the balcony of a surgeon's office, avenue de l'Opéra, Paris]]
In preparation for the Salon de la Section d'Or, and in the wake of their controversial showing at the Salon des Indépendants in the spring of 1911, Albert Gleizes and [[Jean Metzinger]] published a major defense of Cubism and the first theoretical essay on the new movement, entitled ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]''.

Passages of their text which attempted to reconcile goals and methods of modern painting were read to the circle around the Duchamp brothers (the Puteaux group) during the summer of 1912 and it was published before the conclusion of the Salon de la Section d’Or, where Gleizes exhibited his monumental Cubist painting ''The Harvesters''. Gleizes believed that artists could explain themselves in writing as well as (or better than) critics. He continued writing throughout the following years as ''Du "Cubisme"'' enjoyed wide circulation within a continuously growing circle of artists and connoisseurs. By placing the artist at the centre of society, Albert Gleizes, along with a generation of painters from diverse classes and nations, helped revolutionize the bourgeois canons. By observing and thinking, as opposed to serving solely as an ornamenter, Gleizes concluded, the artist realized a fundamental service to humanity.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, MoMA"/&gt;

Shortly after the 1912 publication of ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', Guillaume Apollinaire published ''Les Peintres Cubiste'' (1913, written in 1912), in which he wrote "Majesty: this is what, above all, characterizes the art of Albert Gleizes. [...] This majesty arouses and provokes the imagination; considered from the plastic point of view, it is the immensity of things. [...] The pictures of Albert Gleizes are realized by a force of the same sort as that which realized the Pyramids and the Cathedrals, the constructions in metal, the bridges and the tunnels."&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Apollinaire, ''Aesthetic Meditations on Painting, The Cubist Painters'' (Second Series), written in 1912, published in 1913 (Edition Figuière, Paris), translated and published in [http://dl.lib.brown.edu/mjp/render.php?id=1299781650906252&amp;view=mjp_object ''The Little Review'', Quarterly Journal of art and letters, ''Stella Number'', Autumn 1922, New York, London] (Administration; Margaret Anderson, Francis Picabia and Ezra Pound).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
* Solomon R. Guggenheim (acquired from the artist in 1938)

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the outset of 1938, Gleizes learned that the religious community that owned Moly Sabata, a large house he had rented in Sablons, was ready to sell. Despite his success at the 1937 [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]], he lacked the funds necessary to purchase the house. In August, however, the American collector, Solomon R. Guggenheim purchased a large number of paintings directly from Gleizes, including his pre-war Cubist masterpiece, ''Le Dépiquage des Moissons''; a work he hoped would have been taken by a museum in France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/a%26rintro Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Disability sidebar}}
The '''InterACT Disability Arts Festival''' is an annual three-day event which showcases the talents of disabled performers, authors, artists, and artisans in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. The event has been described by the [[Minister for Disability Issues]], [[Tariana Turia]], as "a chance for people of all abilities to celebrate and share their talents with us all"&lt;ref name="tariana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infonews.co.nz/news.cfm?id=79010 |title=Minister encourages wider community to support New Zealand's first Disability Arts Festival this weekend |publisher=Infonews.co.nz |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2013-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival was inspired by the [[Awakenings Festival]] of [[Horsham, Victoria]], Australia. It wasn't until five years after a visit to the 2007 Awakenings festival by three representatives of the Interacting Theatre Company, that the inaugural InterACT festival was held in Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Chris Laidlaw, Chris Tally Evans, Paula Crimmens, Trina Armstrong|date=2011-10-30 |title=Radio New Zealand : National : Sunday Morning : 30 Oct 2011 : Ideas for 30 October 2011 |medium=Radio broadcast |url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/sunday/audio/2501301/ideas-for-30-october-2011 |accessdate=2013-09-20 |time=00:28:40 |publisher=Radionz.co.nz |quote=I work for Interacting, which is a disabled arts theatre company. And I went with Trina and our Chair[person] to Australia, to the Awakenings festival in 2007. It's taken us this long to decide we wanted to put on a festival, because essentially we're a theatre company and we do two productions a year. But last year we decided we were in a position with sufficient support networks and relationships with other organisations to go for it, and to put on a New Zealand version of the annual Awakenings festival in Australia. |ref= }}&lt;!--{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/sunday/audio/2501301/ideas-for-30-october-2011 |title=Radio New Zealand : National : Sunday Morning : 30 Oct 2011 : Ideas for 30 October 2011 |publisher=Radionz.co.nz |date=2011-10-30 |accessdate=2013-09-20}}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 edition of the festival is scheduled for 23–25 October and the venue will be Corban's Estate Arts Centre, [[Henderson, New Zealand|Henderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interacting.org.nz/interactfestival/ |title=InterACT Disability Arts Festival |publisher=Interacting.org.nz |date=2013-03-05 |accessdate=2013-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant''' (also known as '''Benjamin Constant'''), born '''Jean-Joseph Constant''' (10 June 1845 – 26 May 1902), was a French painter and [[etcher]] best known for his [[Orientalism|Oriental]] subjects and [[portrait]]s.

==Biography==
Benjamin-Constant was born in Paris. He studied at the [[École des Beaux-Arts|Ecole des Beaux-Arts]] in Toulouse, where he was a pupil of [[Alexandre Cabanel]]. A journey to [[Morocco]] in 1872 strongly influenced his early artistic development and lead him to produce [[Romanticism|Romantic]] scenes under the spell of [[Orientalism]]. Among his noted works in this vein are  ''Last Rebels'', ''Justice in the [[Harem]]'' (both in the Luxembourg Gallery), ''Les Chérifas'', and ''Moroccan Prisoners'' (Bordeaux).  His large canvas, ''[[:File:Benjamin-Constant-The Entry of Mahomet II into Constantinople-1876.jpg|The Entrance of Mahomet II into Constantinople]]'' (Musée des Augustins Toulouse), received a medal in 1876.

[[File:Benjamin Constant, between ca. 1890 and ca. 1910.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Frances Benjamin Johnston]], ''Benjamin Constant'', {{circa|1890–1910}}, [[Library of Congress]]]]

After 1880, he changed his manner, devoting himself to [[mural]] decorations and to [[portrait]]s.  Prominent examples include the great [[plafond]] in the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris]], entitled ''Paris Convening the World''; his paintings in the [[Sorbonne|New Sorbonne]], representing ''Literature'', ''The Sciences'', and the ''Academy of Paris''; and the plafond of the Opéra Comique theatre.  He was distinguished as a portrait painter, especially in England, where he was a favorite of the [[aristocracy]].  His portrait ''Mons fils André'' (Luxembourg) was awarded a medal of honor at the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] in 1896.

Benjamin-Constant painted [[Pope Leo XIII]], [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom]] (1901), [[Baron Savile of Rufford|Lord John Lumley-Savile]], and [[Henri Blowitz]] (1902).  He was made a member of the Institute in 1893, and was a commander of the [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honor]].  He visited the United States several times, and painted a number of portraits.  The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York owns a large mural decoration by Benjamin-Constant entitled ''Justinian in Council''.

Benjamin-Constant also taught; among his pupils was the miniaturist [[Alice Beckington]].&lt;ref name="N.Y.)Barratt2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.)|author2=Carrie Rebora Barratt|author3=Lori Zabar|title=American Portrait Miniatures in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YHKoX40qL7EC&amp;pg=PA244|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-1-58839-357-9|pages=244–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a writer of repute, contributing a number of studies on contemporary French painters.  Along with fellow artists, [[Alphonse-Étienne Dinet|Nasreddine Dinet]], [[Paul Leroy]], [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and curator/ art historian, [[Léonce Bénédite]], he was one of the founders of the [[Société des Peintres Orientalistes Français]].&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, R., ''Orientalist Aesthetics: Art, Colonialism, and French North Africa, 1880-1930,'' University of California Press, 2003, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Paris on 26 May 1902.

The '''Keşlik Stele''' is a [[Neo-Hittite]] monument from northern [[Tyana]], near [[Niğde]] discovered in 1962 in southern [[Turkey]], which dates from the 8th century BC.

== Discovery ==
The stele was discovered by Vural Sezer in the ''Bayındır Yaylası'' summer pasture of the village of Keşlik, a plateau north of [[Altunhisar]] in [[Niğde Province]] and was installed in the Niğde Museum. The location of discovery was part of the [[Iron Age]] [[Luwian]] kingdom of [[Tuwana]]. According to the testimony of local landowner Abdullah Tanik about the find, it was discovered by Turkish archaeologist Aykut Çınaroğlu in a 1962 survey. The stele had probably fallen from a hill which rises 25 m above the surrounding fields, since a depression has been found there which could have contained the pedestal of a stele. The monument is now in the [[Niğde Archaeological Museum]] and has the inventory number 51.

== Description ==
The brown [[Basalt]] stele is 1.45 m high, 69&amp;nbsp;cm wide and about 27&amp;nbsp;cm thick. The upper surface is severely weathered and pock marked. The image depicts the weather god [[Tarhunzas]] facing right. He is dressed in a short kilt, a short-sleeved over-tunic with a wide belt, and thigh-high boots. His head is bearded and he has shoulder-length hair, covered by a horned helmet. His right hand is bent at his side and holds a cluster of grapes, while his left hand holds a bundle of corn ears. Thegrape cluster and the corn ears both grow up from the ground on either side of him.

In the space to the right, between the figure and the corn ears, [[John David Hawkins]] detected nine lines of an inscription, which probably continued on the side of the stele. Because of the poor state of preservation of the stele, it was not legible.

The image is very similar to the depiction of the weather god on the [[İvriz relief]]. As a result, the Keşlik stele is dated to the same time as it - the reig of King [[Warpalawas]] of Tuwana (740-705).

'''Lily Delissa Joseph''' née '''Solomon''', (24 June 1863-27 July 1940) was a British artist and social campaigner active in the English [[Suffragette]] movement.

==Biography==
Joseph was born in [[Bermondsey]] in London into a wealthy, cultured Jewish family.&lt;ref name=JWeiner&gt;{{cite web |author=Julia Weiner|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/artists-in-britain-1700-1940 |title=Artists in Britain: 1700-1940|year=1996|accessdate=24 September 2018|work=Jewish Women's Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BritPort"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Brian Stewart &amp; Mervyn Cutten|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=1997|title=The Dictionary of Portrait Painters in Britain up to 1920|ISBN=1 85149 173 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her elder brother was the artist [[Solomon J Solomon]] and [[Flora Lion]] would be a cousin.&lt;ref name=JWeiner/&gt; Joseph attended the Ridley School of Art and the [[Royal College of Art]] in London.&lt;ref name="Spalding"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Frances Spalding]]|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=1990|title=20th Century Painters and Sculptors |ISBN=1 85149 106 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She painted portraits, interiors and urban landscapes in a style clearly influenced by [[Impressionism]] but often with a limited palette.&lt;ref name=JWeiner/&gt;

Joseph was also an activist in both the women's sufferage movement and in support of Jewish charities. She was among the founders of the Ladies' Guild at the Hammersmith Synagogue in west London and also ran reading rooms in the [[Whitechapel]] area.&lt;ref name="AFoster"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alicia Foster|publisher=Tate Publishing|year=2004|title=Tate Women Artists|ISBN=1-85437-311-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; After meeting [[Isaac Rosenberg]] in 1911, she helped pay for his studies at the [[Slade School of Art]].&lt;ref name="AFoster"/&gt; Joseph was arrested, at least, once during the women's [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|suffrage campagn]]. When her 1912 exhibition at the Baille Gallery, ''Some London and Country Interiors'', was reviewed in the [[Jewish Chronicle]] a notice appeared on the same page apologising for her absence from the show's Private View reception on the grounds that "she was detained at [[Holloway Prison|Holloway Goal]] in connection with the Women's Sufferage Movement".&lt;ref name="AFoster"/&gt;&lt;ref name=JWeiner/&gt;

In 1924, Joseph and her architect husband held a joint exhibition of drawings and paintings at the Suffolk Street Galleries.&lt;ref name="AFoster"/&gt; Throughout her life Joseph was a regular exhibitor at the [[Royal Academy]], showing some twenty-five paintings between 1904 and 1938.&lt;ref name="BritPort"/&gt; She also exhibited with the [[Society of Women Artists]], the [[New English Art Club]] and the [[Royal Society of British Artists]].&lt;ref name="Spalding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFoster"/&gt; Joseph exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] receiving an ''Honourable Mention'' on one occasion and in 1929 winning a selver medal.&lt;ref name="GMWaters"&gt;{{cite book|author=Grant M.

'''Mack Scogin Merrill Elam Architects''' is an American architecture firm based at Atlanta, Georgia. The two principal architects are husband and wife Mack Scogin and [[Merrill Elam]].  The firm was first founded in 1984 as Parker and Scogin, and later, from 1984 to 2000, as Scogin Elam and Bray, and from 2000 as Mack Scogin Merrill Elam Architects. The architects are well known for their [[Modern architecture|modernist]] buildings, often playing on polemical themes. The architects have received numerous architectural prizes and awards for their works.

==Founders==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
Mack Scogin studied architecture at [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], completing a Bachelor of Architecture degree in 1966. He is the Kajima Professor in Practice of Architecture at [[Harvard University]] Graduate School of Design, where he was chairman of the Department of Architecture from 1990 to 1995. He also taught at the Austin E. Knowlton School of Architecture, The [[Ohio State University]] in 2003–2004.

Merrill Elam first studied architecture at [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], completing a Bachelor of Architecture degree in 1971, before completing a master's degree in business administration at [[Georgia State University]] in 1982. She has also studied briefly at [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]]. She has held several positions in schools of architecture in the USA and Canada, including the Harry S. Shure Visiting Professorship at the [[University of Virginia]] in 2010, Visiting Chair in Architectural Design at the [[University of Toronto]] in 2005, Visiting Professor at Austin E. Knowlton School of Architecture, The Ohio State University, 2003–2004, Visiting Professor of Architectural Design at The [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 2003, Visiting Professor of Architectural Design at [[Yale University]] in 1996, and Research Professor of Architecture at [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] in 1994.

== Critical response ==
The buildings of Mack Scogin Merrill Elam Architects have received much critical interpretation in architectural journals. But they have also attracted clients with avant-gardist aspirations. "Unusually extroverted" was what magistrates asked Mack Scogin Merrill Elam to deliver for the design of a $63 million federal courthouse in Austin, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/print.asp?REF=http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/060503austin.asp [[Architectural Record]] on Mack Scogin Merrill Elam Architects&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York Times]] architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff wrote that the building exhibited a tension "between the desire to uphold core democratic values and a growing sense of instability".&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E3D81130F93AA2575AC0A9629C8B63&amp;pagewanted=all Nicolai Ouroussoff, "ARCHITECTURE; Uncle Sam, Visionary Builder?" New York Times, September 19, 2004&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The building is conceived as an eight-story cube, its interlocking forms resting on a concrete base. Deep recesses set into the building create a play of light and shadow. The visual game continues inside, where the walls and walkways enclosing a lobby atrium dissolve into a cubist composition of intersecting planes. The lightness of the forms recalls the theoretical structures of [[Frederick Kiesler]], the utopian who imagined weightless buildings suspended in air. But if you circle around to the back of the model, the upper floors begin to shift, setting the entire structure off balance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2643">In art, '''musivisual language''' is a [[Semiotics|semiotic]] system that is the synchronous union of music and image. The term was coined by Spanish composer [[Alejandro Román]], and for over a century, has appeared in film and other media (television, video or [[multimedia]]). 

== Definition ==
According to Román:

{{quote|''Musivisual Language'' is a special language of music placed in film and from film, understood not only from structural point of view, rhythm and sound-material, but also from the relationships and meaning semiotics in relation to the close interaction with the image and plot.'' |Román, 2008: 84}}

When film music and text connect, they produce meanings distinct from the separate elements. In this communication process, musical codes ([[melody]], rhythm, [[harmony]], sound, [[Texture (music)|texture]], [[Musical form|form]]), in synchrony with the film ([[image]], [[speech]], [[noise]]...) interact. 

Román defines two levels for this language: ''semiotic'', i.e. the contribution of meaning of music over the image, and the specific ''aesthetic'' of film music, which means it has its own stylistic elements not belonging to other musical forms. These elements are determined by the cinematic form.

The Cheboygan '''Opera House''' is a 582-seat [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] building and theater space located in [[Cheboygan, Michigan]].
The Opera House is a multiple-use building and contains the town's [[city hall]], [[police]] headquarters, and [[firefighter|fire]] station, as well as the theater. The Opera House is located in downtown Cheboygan west of the Cheboygan River.  Its address is 403 North Huron Street.&lt;ref name="Opera House"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoperahouse.org/|title=The Opera House|work=[Cheboygan, Mich.] Opera House|accessdate=2009-01-21|format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
==History==
The theater was originally constructed in 1877, but was rebuilt after fire damage in 1888, and the current theater layout is considered authentic to that date.  The theater was further rebuilt in 1903 after another fire.  After serving the people of Cheboygan for many decades, the Opera House went dark in the 1960s.  It was refurbished and reopened in 1984.&lt;ref name="Opera House"/&gt;

'''''Oriental Stories,''''' later retitled '''''The Magic Carpet Magazine''''', was an American [[pulp magazine]] of 1930-34, an offshoot of the famous ''[[Weird Tales]]''.

Like its parent, it was published by [[J.C. Henneberger]]'s Popular Fiction Publishing and edited by [[Farnsworth Wright]]. As its titles indicate, the magazine specialized in adventure and fantasy stories with Oriental settings and elements. Its stories were largely written by the same distinctive group of authors that filled the pages of ''Weird Tales,'' including [[Robert E. Howard]],&lt;ref&gt;"Robert E. Howard, Professional Writer" by [[Glenn Lord]], in Don Herron, ed. 
''The Dark Barbarian: The Writings of Robert E Howard, a Critical Anthology.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1984, (pp. 135-148).

The magazine struggled financially for the entirety of its existence (as indeed did ''Weird Tales''); it was published first bi-monthly, then quarterly, during the grimmest years of the [[Great Depression]]. Volume 1 of ''Oriental Stories'' consisted of 6 issues that appeared on newsstands from October 1930 through Autumn 1931; Volume 2 comprised only 3 issues in the first half of 1932 (Winter, Spring, Summer). After a six-month hiatus, the first of four quarterly issues of Volume 3 appeared in January 1933, but with the new title ''The Magic Carpet.'' ("Oriental Stories combined with The Magic Carpet Magazine," read the masthead of Vol. 3 No. 1, January 1933.)
One notable contributor to ''The Magic Carpet'' was popular pulp author [[H. Bedford-Jones]].&lt;ref name="os" /&gt; Still unable to muster sufficient circulation, Volume 4 started and ended with the single issue No. 1 in January 1934. ''The Magic Carpet'' was then defunct.

'''[[Palestinians|Palestinian]] views on the [[Peace process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict|peace process]]''' with [[Israel]] are wide ranging.  The goal that unites Palestinians is the establishment of a [[Palestinian state]] where, among other things, [[Palestinian refugees]] may resettle.  Some Palestinians want that state to be established in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]], whereas other Palestinians want that state to replace the State of Israel.

==Background==
[[Palestinians]] have held diverse views and perceptions of the peace process. A key starting point for understanding these views is an awareness of the differing objectives sought by advocates of the Palestinian cause.  '[[New Historian]]' Israeli academic [[Ilan Pappe]] says the cause of the conflict from a Palestinian point of view dates back to 1948 with the creation of [[Israel]] (rather than Israel’s views of 1967 being the crucial point and the return of occupied territories being central to peace negotiations), and that the conflict has been a fight to bring home [[Palestinian refugee|refugees]] to a [[Palestinian state]].&lt;ref name="Pappe, I. 2004"&gt;Pappe, I., 2004, ''A History of Modern Palestine: One Land, Two Peoples'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this for some was the ultimate aim of the peace process, and for groups such as [[Hamas]] still is. However, Jerome Slater says that this ‘maximalist’ view of a destruction of Israel in order to regain Palestinian lands, a view held by [[Yasser Arafat|Arafat]] and the [[PLO]] initially, has steadily moderated from the late 1960s onwards to a preparedness to negotiate and instead seek a two-state solution.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, J., 2001, What Went Wrong? The Collapse of the Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process, ''Political Science'', Volume 116, Issue 2, Pages 171-199, page 176&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Oslo Accords]] demonstrated the recognition of this acceptance by the then Palestinian leadership of the state of Israel’s [[right to exist]] in return for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[West Bank]].&lt;ref name="Slater, J. 2001, Pages 171-199"&gt;Slater, J., 2001, What Went Wrong? The Collapse of the Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process, ''Political Science'', Volume 116, Issue 2, Pages 171-199&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are recurrent themes prevalent throughout peace process negotiations including a feeling that Israel offers too little and a mistrust of its actions and motives.&lt;ref name="Pappe, I. 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bregman, A. &amp; El-Tahri, J., 1998, ''The Sixty Year War: Israel and the Arabs'', London, Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the demand for the "Right of Return" (ROR) by descendants of Palestinian refugees to Israel has remained a cornerstone of the Palestinian view and has been repeatedly enunciated by Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas who is leading the Palestinian peace effort.

==Yasser Arafat and the PLO==
[[Image:Yasser-arafat-1999.jpg|thumb|200px|Yasser Arafat]]

{{rquote|left|Our basic aim is to liberate the land from the Mediterranean Seas to the Jordan River.... The Palestinian revolution's basic concern is the uprooting of the Zionist entity from our land and liberating it.

The PLO has complex, often contradictory attitudes toward the peace process.  Officially, the PLO acceptance of [[Israel]]'s right to exist in peace was the first of the [[PLO]]'s obligations in the [[Oslo Accords]].  In Yasser Arafat's September 9, 1993 letter to Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], as part of the first Oslo accord, Arafat stated that "The PLO recognizes the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Aburish |title=From Defender to Dictator |year=1998 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |pages=201–228 |location=New York |isbn=1-58234-049-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, evidence throughout history and even during the 1990s and 2000s have shown that the PLO leadership considered any peace made with Israel to be temporary until the dream of Israel's destruction could be realized.&lt;ref name="Karsh"&gt;[[Efraim Karsh|Karsh, Efraim]].  ''Arafat's War: The Man and His Battle for Israeli Conquest''. New York: Grove Press, 2003.  pp. 57-59, 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dore Gold|Gold, Dore]].  ''The Fight for Jerusalem: Radical Islam, the West, and the Future of the Holy City''.  Washington: Regnery Publishing, Inc., 2007.  p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=May 2013}} Arafat often spoke of the peace process in terms of "justice" for the Palestinians; terms historian [[Efraim Karsh]] described as "euphemisms rooted in Islamic and Arabic history for the liberation of the whole of Palestine from 'foreign occupiers.'"&lt;ref name="Karsh" /&gt; When describing his views of the peace process among Arab leaders and in the media of the Arab world, Arafat's rhetoric became noticeably more bellicose than it was when among Western leaders and media outside of the Arab world.&lt;ref name="Karsh" /&gt; The period saw a disconnect between what the PLO's second in command [[Abu Iyad]] referred to as "the language of peace" and support of Palestinian terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abu Iyad]] interview with ''al-Fiqr al-Dimuqrati'' (Nicosia), vol. 7, Summer 1989.  qtd. in Karsh, 2003, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, there has been a debate within the PLO as to whether to halt terrorist activities completely or to continue attacking Israel as well as negotiate diplomatically with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avraham Sela|Sela, Avraham]].  "Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)." ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''.  Ed. Sela.  New York: Continuum, 2002.  pp. 689-696.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, terrorism was never fully banned.  Furthermore, assassination attempts by radical Palestinian factions within the PLO since the early years of the peace process kept Arafat from expressing full, public support of the peace process or condemnation of terrorism without risking further danger to his own life.&lt;ref name="Eran"&gt;Eran, Oded. "Arab-Israel Peacemaking." ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia''.  Ed. [[Avraham Sela]].  New York: Continuum, 2002.  pp. 121-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, after Yasser Arafat rejected [[Camp David 2000 Summit|the offer]] made to him by [[Ehud Barak]] based on the two-state solution and declined to negotiate for a more favorable offer, it became clear that Arafat would not make a deal with Israel unless it included the full [[Palestinian right of return]], which would demographically destroy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-quot-right-of-return-quot-a-plot-to-destroy-the-jewish-state "The 'Right of Return': A Plot to ...."] ''Jewish Virtual Library''.  30 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the Jewish character{{Definition|date=May 2013}} of the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Heather.

==Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad==

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2005, Hamas was criticized by Islamic Jihad for calling off rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza.

In 2008, Hamas publicly offered a long-term [[hudna]] (truce) with Israel if Israel agreed to return to its 1967 borders and to grant the "[[right of return]]" to all [[Palestinian refugee]]s.  In 2010, Ismail Haniyeh announced that Hamas would accept the outcome of a Palestinian referendum on a peace treaty with Israel even if the results were not in line with their ideology.  This represented a departure from their earlier insistence that they would not be bound by any such result.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/hamas-vows-to-honor-palestinian-referendum-on-peace-with-israel-1.328234&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, [[Mousa Abu Marzook]], a high-ranking Hamas official in competition with Haniyeh for Hamas' top leadership post, gave an interview in which he expressed a range of opinions, some of which differed from the organisation's actual stance.  He said that Hamas will not recognize Israel and will not feel bound to understand a peace treaty negotiated by Fatah as a recognition of Israel, calling instead for a ''hudna'' (temporary truce).  Abu Marzook echoed Haniyeh's demand that Palestinians should be given the unconditional right to return into what is now Israel proper.&lt;ref name="Cohler"&gt;Cohler-Esses, Larry.  [http://forward.com/articles/155054/hamas-wouldn-t-honor-a-treaty-top-leader-says/?p=all "Hamas Wouldn’t Honor a Treaty, Top Leader Says."] ''The Jewish Daily Forward''.  19 April 2012.  26 April 2012.  "&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prominent Palestinians==

[[Rashid Abu Shbak]], a senior PA security official declared, "The light which has shone over [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and [[Jericho]] [when the PA assumed control over those areas] will also reach the [[Negev]] and the [[Galilee]] [which constitute a large portion of pre-1967 Israel]."&lt;ref&gt;Yediot Ahronot, May 29, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The PA's Voice of Palestine radio station broadcast a Friday prayer sermon by [[Yusuf Abu Sneineh]], official preacher at Jerusalem's [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], over the radio.  In it, he asserted, "The struggle we are waging is an ideological struggle and the question is: where has the Islamic land of Palestine gone? Where [are] Haifa and Jaffa, Lod and Ramle, Acre, Safed and Tiberias?  Where is Hebron and Jerusalem?"&lt;ref&gt;Voice of Palestine, May 23, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Archive/Peace+Process/1997/SENIOR+PALESTINIAN+OFFICIALS+CONTINUE+TO+INCITE+AG.htm?DisplayMode=print "SENIOR PALESTINIAN OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO INCITE AGAINST ISRAEL."] ''[[Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]''.  29 May 1997.  1 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

PA cabinet minister Abdul Aziz Shaheen told the official PA newspaper, ''Al-Havat Al-Jadida'', on January 4, 1998, "The Oslo accord was a preface for the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Authority will be a preface for the Palestinian state which, in its turn, will be a preface for the liberation of the entire Palestinian land."{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

[[Faisal Husseini]], former Palestinian Authority Minister for Jerusalem, compared the [[al-Aqsa intifada]] following the [[Oslo peace process]] to the tactic of coming out of the [[Trojan Horse]] used by the Greeks in the myth of the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

[[File:The Driller Killer Pinball Scene Shot to Shot.png|thumb|right|300px|An example of an explicit POV shot from the [[public domain]] [[horror film]] ''[[The Driller Killer]]'', putting the audience into the perspective of the protagonist [[Pinball|playing pinball]] with the top shot coming five seconds before the below shot.]]

A '''point of view shot''' (also known as '''POV shot''', '''first-person shot''' or a '''subjective camera''') is a short [[film scene]] that shows what a character (the subject) is looking at (represented through the [[camera]]). It is usually established by being positioned between a [[shot (filming)|shot]] of a character looking at something, and a shot showing the character's reaction (see [[shot reverse shot]]). The technique of POV is one of the foundations of [[film editing]].

==Subjectives==
A POV shot need not be the strict point-of-view of an actual single character in a film. Sometimes the point-of-view shot is taken over the shoulder of the character (third person), who remains visible on the screen. Sometimes a POV shot is "shared" ("dual" or "triple"), i.e. it represents the joint POV of two (or more) characters.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Point-of-view''', or simply '''p.o.v'''., [[camera angle]]s record the scene from a particular player's viewpoint. The point-of-view is an '''objective angle''', but since it falls between the objective and subjective angle, it should be placed in a separate category and given special consideration. A point-of-view shot is as close as an objective shot can approach a subjective shot—and still remain objective. The camera is positioned at the side of a subjective player—whose viewpoint is being depicted—so that the audience is given the impression they are standing cheek-to-cheek with the off-screen player. The viewer does not see the event through the player's eyes, as in a subjective shot in which the camera trades places with the screen player. He sees the event from the player's viewpoint, as if standing alongside him. Thus, the camera angle remains objective, since it is an unseen observer not involved in the action."

Mascelli, ''The Five C's of Cinematography''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques Simplified |first1=Joseph V. |last1=Mascelli |year=1965 |location=Hollywood, Calif. |publisher=Cine/Grafic Publications |isbn=9780960024001 |oclc=566601 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Supporting narrative elements are required to indicate the shot to the viewer as a POV shot. These may include shot sequencing, [[sound effects]], [[visual effects]] and acting.

==Leading actor POV==
When the [[leading actor]] is the subject of the POV it is known as the subjective viewpoint. The audience sees events through the leading actor's eyes, as if they were experiencing the events themselves. Some films are partially or totally shot using this technique, for example the 1947 [[film noir]] ''[[Lady in the Lake]]'', which is shot entirely through the subjective POV of its central character in an attempt to replicate the first-person narrative style of the [[The Lady in the Lake|Raymond Chandler novel upon which the film is based.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lady in the Lake|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C04E3DE123EEE3BBC4C51DFB766838C659EDE|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 24, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
{{Update|section|date=March 2016}}
POV footage has existed since the first cameras were mounted in early airplanes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinematography.com/articles/aerial_history.asp |title=History of Hollywood's Aerial Cinematography |first=Stan |last=McClain |publisher=cinematography.com |accessdate=2 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020614195440/http://www.cinematography.com/articles/aerial_history.asp |archivedate=14 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cars, anywhere a film’s creator intended to take viewers inside the action with the psychological purpose of giving viewers a feel of "What he or she is going through", he or she being a participant in the subject matter. Cameras were increasingly introduced into more difficult experiences.

Though the unit was heavy relative to its manner of use, it was considered hands-free, and worked.

Numerous companies have developed successful POV designs, from [[Laparoscopy|laparoscopic]] video equipment used inside the body during medical procedures, to high tech film and digital cameras mounted to jets and employed during flight. On professional levels, the equipment is well defined, expensive, and requires intensive training and support.

However the race for hands-free POV cameras for use on a consumer level has always faced problems. The technology has had issues with usability, combining lenses with microphones with batteries with recording units; all connected using spidery cables, which proved cumbersome in use when compared to the quality of the end content.

==Notable examples==
In making 1927's ''[[Napoléon (1927 film)|Napoléon]]'', director [[Abel Gance]] wrapped a camera and much of the lens in sponge padding so that it could be punched by other actors to portray the leading character's point of view during a fist fight, part of a larger [[snowball fight]] between schoolboys including young [[Napoleon]]. Gance wrote in the technical scenario that the camera "defends itself as if it were Bonaparte himself. It is in the fortress and fights back. It clambers on the wall of snow and jumps down, as if it were human. A punch in the lens. Arms at the side of the camera as if the camera itself had arms. Camera K falls on the ground, struggles, gets up." In the scenario, "Camera K" refers to Gance's main photographer, [[Jules Kruger]], who wore the camera mounted to a breastplate strapped to his chest for these shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brownlow |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Brownlow |title=Napoleon: Abel Gance's Classic Film |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=1983 |isbn=9780394533940 |pages=56–57, 76 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=CTElUunbKMissQS8-4CoDg&amp;id=6HeGAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=9780394533940&amp;q=%22Camera+K%22#search_anchor |accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

POV shots were used extensively by Alfred Hitchock for various narrative effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panix.com/~sallitt/intrarealism.html|title=Point of View and "Intrarealism" in Hitchcock|accessdate=12 March 2014|first=Daniel|last= Sallitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2015}}

The long running British sitcom ''[[Peep Show (TV Series)|Peep Show]]'', is filmed entirely in point of view shots.

''[[Enter the Void]]'' (2009) by [[Gaspar Noé]] is shot from the first-person viewpoint, although in an unusual way, since most of the movie involves an [[out-of-body experience]].

The film ''[[Hardcore Henry]]'' (2015) consists almost entirely of POV shots, presenting events from the perspective of the title character, in the style of a [[first-person shooter]] video game. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6hzUZDqoLU&amp;t=87s Deep Web Smooth Criminal]

Nearly the entire film ''[[Maniac_(2012_film)|Maniac]]'', is shot from the murderer's point of view, with his face being shown only in reflections and occasionally in the third person.

The '''Portland Vase''' is a [[Roman glass|Roman]] [[cameo glass]] vase, which is dated to between AD 1 and AD 25, though low BC dates have some scholarly support.&lt;ref&gt;The British Museum dates it between AD 1 and AD 25 – [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=466190 collection database] ("5–25 AD" per the Highlights section, and Williams in 2009); a date some time between 30 BC and 20 BC was suggested in 1990, following research by William Gudenrath, [[Kenneth Painter]] and David Whitehouse, director of the [[Corning Museum of Glass]], ''Journal of Glass Studies'', Vol 32 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the best known piece of Roman cameo glass and has served as an inspiration to many glass and [[porcelain]] makers from about the beginning of the 18th century onwards. It is first recorded in Rome in 1600–1601, and since 1810 has been in the [[British Museum]] in London. It was bought by the museum in 1945 (GR 1945,0927.1) and is normally on display in Room 70.

The vase is about {{Convert|25|cm|}} high and {{Convert|56|cm||abbr=on}} in circumference. It is made of violet-blue glass, and surrounded with a single continuous white glass [[cameo (carving)|cameo]] making two distinct scenes, depicting seven human figures, plus a large snake, and two bearded and horned heads below the handles, marking the break between the scenes.

The bottom of the vase was a cameo glass disc, also in blue and white, showing a head, presumed to be of [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] or [[Priam]] on the basis of the [[Phrygian cap]] it wears.  This [[roundel]] clearly does not belong to the vase, and has been displayed separately since 1845.  It may have been added to mend a break in antiquity or after, or the result of a conversion from an original [[amphora]] form (paralleled by a similar blue-glass cameo vessel from [[Pompeii]]) – it was attached to the bottom from at least 1826.

==Iconography==
The meaning of the images on the vase is unclear, and none of the many theories put forward has been found generally satisfactory. They fall into two main groups: mythological and historical, though a historical interpretation of a myth is also a possibility.  Historical interpretations focus on [[Augustus]], his family and his rivals, especially given the quality and expense of the object, and the somewhat remote neo-classicism of the style, which compares with some Imperial [[engraved gem|gemstone cameos]] featuring Augustus and his family with divine attributes, such as the [[Gemma Augustea]], the [[Great Cameo of France]] and the [[Blacas Cameo]] (the last also in the British Museum).  Interpretations of the portrayals have included that of a marine setting (due to the presence of a ketos or sea-snake), and of a marriage theme/context, as the vase may have been a wedding gift. Many scholars (including [[Charles Towneley]]) have concluded that the figures do not fit into a single [[iconographic]] set.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

===Scene 1===
Interpretations include:
* The marriage of the sea-gods [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]], "the most enduring mythological interpretation".{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=292}}
* Dionysos greeting Ariadne with her sacred serpent, in the sacred grove for their marriage, symbolized by [[Cupid#Roman Cupid|Cupid]] with a nuptial torch, in the presence of his foster-father, [[Silenus]]
* The story of the Emperor [[Augustus]]' supposed siring by the god [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]] in the form of a snake
* The younger man is [[Mark Antony]] being lured by the wiles of the reclining woman, [[Cleopatra VII]] (accompanied by an [[asp (reptile)|asp]], the alleged type of [[venomous snake]] involved in the [[death of Cleopatra]]),{{sfn|Roller|2010|p=178}} into losing his manly [[romanitas]] and becoming decadent, with the bearded elder male figure being his mythical ancestor [[Antonia (gens)|Anton]] looking on.{{sfn|Roller|2010|p=178}}
* The dream of [[Olympias]], mother of [[Alexander the Great]], who is emerging from the building to greet her, with his father Apollo as the serpent. This was the first theory, dating to 1633, and connected to Severus Alexander and his mother, "of whom a similar tale of reptilian paternity was told".{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=290}}

===Scene 2===
[[Image:Portland Vase BM Gem4036 n4.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Scene 2]]
Interpretations include:
* A divinatory dream by [[Hecuba]] that the [[Judgement of Paris]] would lead to the destruction of [[Troy]]
* [[Ariadne]] languishing on [[Naxos Island|Naxos]]
* The woman languishing is [[Octavia Minor]], abandoned by Mark Antony, between her brother Augustus{{sfn|Roller|2010|p=178}} (left, as a god, as on the contemporary [[Sword of Tiberius]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/t/the_sword_of_tiberius.aspx |title=The sword of Tiberius |publisher=British Museum |date=2011-09-29 |accessdate=2011-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120913161441/http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/t/the_sword_of_tiberius.aspx |archivedate=2012-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Venus Genetrix]], the ancestor of Augustus and Octavia's [[Julius|Julian gens]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

====Octavian theory====
[[File:Portland Vase BM Gem4036 n3.jpg|thumb|left|Detail, with the figure who might be [[Octavian]]]]
Another variant theory is that the vase dates back to circa 32 BC, and was commissioned by Octavian (later Caesar [[Augustus]]), as an attempt to promote his case against his fellow-consuls, [[Mark Antony]] and [[Marcus Lepidus]] in the period after the death of [[Julius Caesar]]. It is based on the skill of the famous Greek carver of [[engraved gem]]s [[Dioskourides (artist)|Dioskourides]], who is recorded as active and at his peak circa 40–15 BC and three of whose attributed cameos bear a close resemblance in line and quality to the Portland vase figures.  This theory proposes that the first two figures are Gaius Octavius, father of the future emperor, and Atia Balba Caesonia, his mother (hence Cupid with the arrow) who had a dream of being impregnated by Apollo in the form of a sea serpent (ketos), note the snake's prominent teeth.  The onlooker with his staff, could be [[Aeneas]], a hero of the Trojan Wars who saved his father by carrying over his back (hence his hunched position, and his Trojan beard) and who is believed to have founded Rome, and from whom the [[Julian gens]], including [[Julius Caesar]] and Attia, claimed descent, witnessing the conception of Rome's future savior as an Empire, and the greatest of all the Emperors.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

On the reverse is Octavian, Octavia his sister, widow of Mark Anthony (downcast flambeau, broken tablets) and Livia, Octavian's third wife who outlived him. These two are looking directly at each other. Octavian commanded she divorce her then husband and marry him with a few weeks of meeting, she was mother to the future Emperor Tiberius.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

This vase suggests Octavian was descended partly from Apollo (thus partly divine, shades of Achilles), whom he worshiped as a God, gave private parties in his honor together with Minerva, Roman Goddess of War, from the founder of Rome, and his connection to his uncle Julius Caesar, for whom as a young man he gave a remarkable funeral oratory, and who adopted him on his father's death, when he was only four.  All the pieces and people fit in this theory and it explains most mysteries (apart from who actually made it).  It would have been a fabulously expensive piece to commission, so that few men of the period could have afforded it.  Several attempts at creating the vase must have been made, as modern reproduction trials show today (see below).  Historians and archeologists dismiss this modern theory as gods and goddesses with mythical allegories were usually portrayed, but could this remarkable vase have broken convention, and shown realism in portraiture, known solely on coins of the period, before it, in turn, was broken?{{cn|date=August 2017}}{{original research inline|date=June 2017}}

==Manufacture==
Cameo-glass vessels were probably all made within about two generations,{{sfn|Williams|2009|pp=292–293}} as experiments when the blowing technique (discovered in about 50 BC) was still in its infancy. Recent research suggests that the Portland vase, like the majority of cameo-glass vessels, was made by the dip-overlay method, whereby an elongated bubble of glass was partially dipped into a [[crucible]] of white glass, before the two were blown together. After cooling the white layer was cut away to form the design.{{sfn|Williams|2009|pp=293}}

The work in making a 19th-century copy proved to be incredibly painstaking, and based on this it is believed that the Portland Vase must have taken its original artisan no less than two years to produce.  The cutting was probably performed by a skilled gem-cutter.&lt;ref name="lierke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosemarie-lierke.de/English/Cameo_glass/cameo_glass.html |title=Cameo glass |publisher=Rosemarie-lierke.de |date= |accessdate=2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the cutter may have been [[Dioskourides (artist)|Dioskourides]], as [[engraved gem]]s thought to be cut by him of a similar period and signed by him (Vollenweider 1966, see Gem in the collection of the [[Duke of Devonshire]] "Diomedes stealing the Palladium") are extant. This is confirmed by the [[Corning Museum of Glass|Corning Museum]] in their 190-page study of the vase{{cn|date=July 2018}} – see above.

According to a controversial theory by [[Rosemarie Lierke]], the vase, along with the rest of Roman cameo glass, was moulded rather than cold-cut, probably using white glass powder for the white layer.&lt;ref name="lierke"/&gt;

Jerome Eisenberg has argued in ''Minerva'' that the vase was produced in the 16th century AD and not antiquity, because the iconography is incoherent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/3169929.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Age puzzle over 'Roman' treasure |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-08-21 |accessdate=2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this theory has not been widely accepted.

==Rediscovery and provenance==
[[Image:V&amp;A, 6th Dec 05 228.jpg|thumb|right|Wedgwood copy in the British Galleries at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London, with the original roundel base still in place]]
One story suggests that it was discovered by Fabrizio Lazzaro in what was then thought to be the [[sarcophagus]] of the Emperor [[Alexander Severus]] (died 235) and his mother, at [[Monte del Grano]] near [[Rome]], and excavated some time around 1582.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=290}}

The first historical reference to the vase is in a letter of 1601 from the French scholar [[Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc|Nicolas Claude Fabri de Peiresc]] to the painter [[Peter Paul Rubens]], where it is recorded as in the collection of [[Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte]] in Italy. In 1626 it passed into the [[Barberini]] family collection (which also included sculptures such as the [[Barberini Faun]] and [[Barberini Apollo]]) where it remained for some two hundred years, being one of the treasures of Maffeo Barberini, later [[Pope Urban VIII]] (1623–1644). It was at this point that the Severan connection is first recorded.  The vase was known as the "Barberini Vase" in this period.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=290}}

===1778 to present===
Between 1778 and 1780, [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]], British ambassador in Naples, bought the vase from [[James Byres]], a Scottish art dealer, who had acquired it after it was sold by [[Cornelia Barberini-Colonna]], Princess of [[Palestrina]]. She had inherited the vase from the Barberini family. Hamilton brought it to England on his next leave, after the death of his first wife, Catherine. In 1784, with the assistance of his niece, Mary, he arranged a private sale of the vase to [[Margaret Cavendish-Harley]], widow of [[William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland]] and dowager Duchess of Portland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.harleygallery.co.uk/event.php?pg_id=3&amp;range=0|title=art gallery and crafts centre in Welbeck, Worksop, Nottinghamshire|publisher=The Harley Gallery|date=|accessdate=2011-12-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115114025/http://www.harleygallery.co.uk/event.php?pg_id=3|archivedate=2011-11-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sold at auction in 1786 and passed into the possession of the duchess's son, [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland]].

The 3rd Duke lent the original vase to [[Josiah Wedgwood]] (see below) and then to the British Museum for safe-keeping, by which point it was known as the "Portland Vase".  It was deposited there permanently by [[William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland|the fourth Duke]] in 1810, after a friend of his broke its base.  The original Roman vase has remained in the British Museum ever since 1810, apart from three years in 1929–32 when the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland|6th Duke]] put it up for sale at [[Christie's]] where it failed to reach its reserve. It was finally purchased by the museum from the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 7th Duke of Portland|7th Duke]] in 1945 with the aid of a bequest from James Rose Vallentin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=466190&amp;partId=1|title=The Portland Vase|website=British Museum|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Copies====
[[Image:Portland Vase V&amp;A.jpg|thumb|left|Replica of Portland Vase, about 1790, Josiah Wedgwood and Sons; V&amp;A Museum no. 2418-1901]]

The 3rd Duke lent the vase to Josiah Wedgwood, who had already had it described to him as "the finest production of Art that has been brought to England and seems to be the very apex of perfection to which you are endeavoring" by the sculptor [[John Flaxman]].  Wedgwood devoted four years of painstaking trials at duplicating the vase – not in glass but in black and white [[jasperware]]. He had problems with his copies ranging from cracking and blistering (clearly visible on the example at the Victoria and Albert Museum) to the [[Sprigging (pottery)|sprigged]] reliefs 'lifting' during the firing, and in 1786 he feared that he could never apply the Jasper relief thinly enough to match the glass original's subtlety and delicacy.  He finally managed to perfect it in 1790, with the issue of the "first-edition" of copies (with some of this edition, including the V&amp;A one, copying the cameo's delicacy by a combination of undercutting and shading the reliefs in grey), and it marks his last major achievement.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Wedgwood put the first edition on private show between April and May 1790, with that exhibition proving so popular that visitor numbers had to be restricted by only printing 1,900 tickets, before going on show in his public London showrooms.  (One ticket to the private exhibition, illustrated by Samuel Alkin and printed with 'Admission to see Mr Wedgwood's copy of The Portland Vase, Greek Street, Soho, between 12 o'clock and 5', was bound into the Wedgwood catalogue on view in the Victoria and Albert Museum's British Galleries.)  As well as the V&amp;A copy (said to have come from the collection of Wedgwood's grandson, the naturalist [[Charles Darwin]])
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jackson, Anna (ed.)|title= V&amp;A: A Hundred Highlights|publisher=V&amp;A Publications|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; others are held at the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] (this is the copy sent by Wedgwood to [[Erasmus Darwin]] which his descendants lent to the Museum in 1963 and later sold to them); the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/vase-copy-portland-vase-josiah-wedgwood-and-sons-ltd |title=vase (copy of Portland vase) &amp;#124; Indianapolis Museum of Art |publisher=Imamuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of Prehistory and Europe at the British Museum.

The vase also inspired a 19th-century competition to duplicate its cameo-work in glass, with Benjamin Richardson offering a £1,000 prize to anyone who could achieve that feat. Taking three years, glass maker Philip Pargeter made a copy and John Northwood engraved it, to win the prize. This copy is in the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] in Corning, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmog.org/video/replica-portland-vase|title=All About Glass {{!}} Corning Museum of Glass|website=www.cmog.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wedgwood Museum, in Barlaston, near Stoke-on-Trent, contains a display describing the trials of replicating the vase, and several examples of the early experiments are shown.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

====Vandalism and reconstruction====
[[File:Thomas H. Shepherd - The Portland Vase fragments.jpg|thumb|The Portland Vase fragments –watercolor by Thomas H. Shepherd (1845)]]
On 7 February 1845, the vase was shattered by William Lloyd,{{sfn|Brooks|2004|pp=16–18}} who, after drinking all the previous week, threw a nearby sculpture on top of the case, smashing both it and the vase. He was arrested and charged with the crime of wilful damage. When his lawyer pointed out an error in the wording of the act which seemed to limit its application to the destruction of objects worth no more than five pounds, he was convicted instead of the destruction of the glass case in which the vase had sat. He was ordered to pay a fine of three pounds or spend two months in prison. He remained in prison until an anonymous benefactor paid the fine by mail.{{sfn|Brooks|2004|pp=16–18}} The name William Lloyd is thought to be a pseudonym. Investigators hired by the British Museum concluded that he was actually William Mulcahy, a student who had gone missing from Trinity College. Detectives reported that the Mulcahy family was impoverished. The owner of the vase declined to bring a civil action against William Mulcahy because he did not want his family to suffer for "an act of folly or madness which they could not control".{{sfn|Brooks|2004|pp=16–18}}

[[File:Portland Vase BM Gem4036 n8.jpg|thumb|Another detail, at the side]]

The vase was pieced together with fair success, though the restorer was unable to replace all of the pieces and thirty-seven small fragments were left when he was done. It appears they had been put into a box and forgotten. In 1948, the keeper [[Bernard Ashmole]] received thirty-seven fragments in a box from Mr Croker of Putney, who did not know what they were. In 1845 [[John Doubleday (restorer)|John Doubleday]], the first restorer, had not been able to determine where these fragments went. A colleague took them to Mr Gabb, a box maker, who was asked to make a box with thirty seven compartments, one for each fragment. The colleague died, the box was never collected, Mr Gabb died and his executrix Miss Revees asked Croker to ask the museum if they could identify them.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

By 1948, the restoration appeared aged and it was decided to restore the vase again, but the restorer was successful in replacing only three fragments. The adhesive from this weakened: by 1986 the joints rattled when the vase was gently tapped.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

The third and current reconstruction took place from 1 June 1988 and was completed on 1 October 1989 by [[Nigel Williams (conservator)|Nigel Williams]] and Sandra Smith, and overseen by David Akehurst (CCO of Glass and Ceramics) who had assessed the vase's condition during its appearance as the focal piece of an international exhibition of Roman glass and, at the conclusion of the exhibition, it was decided to go ahead with reconstruction and stabilization. The treatment had scholarly attention and press coverage. The vase was photographed and drawn to record the position of fragments before dismantling; the BBC filmed the conservation process. All the adhesives used in previous restorations had deteriorated, so to find one that would last, conservation scientists at the museum tested many adhesives for long-term stability. Finally, an epoxy resin with excellent ageing properties was chosen. Reassembly of the vase was made more difficult as the edges of some fragments were found to have been filed down during the restorations. Nevertheless, all of the fragments were replaced except for a few small splinters. Areas that were still missing were gap-filled with a blue or white resin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | ref = harv | last = White | first = Roland | title = Original Sinclair | magazine = Punch | location = London | page = 45 | issue = 6766 | date = 23 June 1989 | url = http://tinyurl.galegroup.com/tinyurl/57jd88 | accessdate = 18 August 2017 }} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|1989|pp=6–21}}

The newly conserved Portland Vase was returned to display. Little sign of the original damage is visible and, except for light cleaning, it is hoped that the vase should not require major conservation work for at least another century.{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=29}}

'''Rosa Maria Arquimbau i Cardil''' (pen name, '''Rosa de Sant Jordi'''; 1909 - 1992) was a [[Catalan people|Catalan]] writer, journalist, feminist, and suffragist. 
Together with [[Maria Teresa Vernet i Real]], [[Carme Montoriol i Puig]], [[Anna Murià]], [[Elvira Augusta Lewi]], [[Aurora Bertrana]], and [[Mercè Rodoreda]], Arquimbau was considered a model of the "femme de lettres" and one of the six major female Catalan novelists of the 1930s.&lt;ref name=DBD /&gt; 
Her novels and plays, which depicted modern life subjects, earned "critical and popular success".&lt;ref name=Wilson1991 /&gt; While they were characterized as vivid and sometimes poignant, they were also criticized as trivial and frivolous.&lt;ref name=ADPC&gt;{{cite web|title=Rosa Maria Arquimbau Cardil  (1910-1992)|url=http://periodistesentempsdificils.adpc.cat/?p=36|publisher=Associació de Dones Periodistes de Catalunya|accessdate=12 April 2014|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Barcelona]], Arquimbau was a relevant Catalan female activist, journalist and writer whose genres included short stories, novels, dramas, comedies, essays, and poetry.&lt;ref name="Wilson1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Katharina M.|title=An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Wf1SVbGFg8C&amp;pg=PA55|year=1991|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8240-8547-6|pages=55–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her short stories were first published when she was a teenager. The humor in her comedies is described as ironic and situational.&lt;ref name=Wilson1991 /&gt;

During the period of 1924-36, she worked at almost all of the daily and weekly newspapers of the left: ''Joventut Catalana'', ''[[La Dona Catalana]]'', ''Flames Noves'', ''La Nau'', ''Imatges'', ''La Publicitat'', ''l'Opinió'', and ''La Humanitat''. She wrote a column in  ''La Rambla'', called "Films &amp; Soda", her comments, often laced with irony, depicting the changes women face. Writing on topics such as secularism, the death penalty, fashion, women's prisons, politics, morality, and Mussolini antifeminism,&lt;ref name=DBD&gt;{{cite web|title=Rosa Maria Arquimbau i Cardil - Escriptora, periodista - També coneguda com Rosa de Sant Jordi|url=http://www.dbd.cat/index.php?option=com_biografies&amp;view=biografia&amp;id=81|publisher=Diccionari Biografic de Dones|accessdate=12 April 2014|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt; her articles often caused controversy with more conservative newspapers.

Arquimbau was a political activist. In 1932, she signed the ''Bases per a la Constitució d’un Front Únic Femení Esquerrista'', participating in the campaign to collect signatures in favor of women's [[suffrage]]. She was president of the  "Front Únic Femení Esquerrista" (United Front of Women from the Left),&lt;ref name=ADPC /&gt; as well as a member of the [[Republican Left of Catalonia]]. She was associated with the Club Femení i d’Esports de Barcelona i al Lyceum Club, Associació de Periodistes de Barcelona and Foment de Cultura Femenina.&lt;ref name=ADPC /&gt;

Of her honors, Arquimbau received the Premio Joan de Santa Maria in 1957.&lt;ref name=Wilson1991 /&gt; She died in Barcelona in 1991.

[[Image:Stage managers panel.jpg|thumb|right|300px|the Part of a freak is stage manager's panel, or "[[Prompt corner]]."]]'''Stage management''' is a broad field that is generally defined as the practice of organization and coordination of an event or theatrical production. Stage management may encompass a variety of activities including the overseeing of the rehearsal process and &amp;nbsp;coordinating communications among various production teams and personnel. Stage management requires a general understanding of all aspects of production and offers organisational support to ensure the process runs smoothly and efficiently.

A '''Stage Manager''' is an individual who has overall responsibility for stage management and the smooth execution of a theatrical production. Stage management may be performed by an individual in small productions, while larger productions typically employ a stage management team consisting of a head stage manager, or "'''Production Stage Manager'''", and one or more '''Assistant Stage Managers'''.

==History==

The title of Stage Manager was not used until the 18th century. Though the concept and need for someone to fill the area of stage management can be seen with the Ancient Greeks. The playwrights were usually responsible for production elements. Sophocles is the first known stage technician, supported by his employment as a scenic artist, playwright, musician, and producer.

Moving into the Middle Ages there is evidence of a Conducteurs De Secrets, who oversaw collecting money at the door and serving as a prompter on stage. The prompter held the script and was prepared to feed performers their lines, this was a common practice of the time. 

Between the Renaissance and 17th century the actors and playwright handled stage management aspects and stage crew. During the Elizabethan and Jacobean Theatre there were two roles that covered the stage management: Stage Keeper and Book Keeper. The Stage Keeper was responsible for the maintenance of the theater, taking props on and off stage, and security of performance space. The Book Keeper was responsible for the stage script, obtaining necessary licenses, copying/providing lines for the performers, marking entrances and exits, tracking props, marking when sound effects come in, and cueing props and sound effects.  

Between the Renaissance and the 16th century, actors and playwrights took upon themselves the handling of finances, general directorial duties, and stage management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Stage management first emerged as a distinct role in the 17th century during Shakespeare's and Molière's time. During Shakespeare’s time the roles of stage management were left to apprentices, young boys learning the trade. There is still evidence of a prompter at this time.

Though it wasn't until the 18th century in England that the term Stage Manager was used. This was the first time a person other than actors and playwright was hired to direct or manage the stage. Over time, with the rise in complexity of theatre due to advances such as mechanized scenery, quick costume changes, and controlled lighting, the stage manager's job was split into two positions—''director'' and ''stage manager''.&lt;ref name="Fazio"&gt;{{cite book| last = Fazio| first = Larry| title = Stage Manager: The Professional Experience| isbn = 0-240-80410-4| publisher = [[Focal Press]]| pages = 367| date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many playwrights, directors, and actors have previously worked as an assistant stage manager. Writer and director [[Preston Sturges]], for example, was employed as an ASM on [[Isadora Duncan]]'s production of ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' at the age of 16 and a half:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When one is responsible for giving an offstage cue, even the simplest ones, like the ring of a telephone or a birdcall, demand considerable sangfroid, and the job is nervewracking. One is very much aware that everything depends on the delivery of the cue at exactly the right microsecond. One stands there, knees slightly bent, breathing heavily...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite sturges}}, p. 123-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sturges didn't last long in this job, due to his calling for thunder and then lightning instead of lightning and then thunder, but 16 years later [[Brock Pemberton]] hired him as an ASM on [[Antoinette Perry]]'s production of ''Goin' Home'', which led to the first mounting of one of Sturges' plays on Broadway, ''[[The Guinea Pig (play)|The Guinea Pig]]'', in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite sturges}} pp. 239-245&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Means of Communication ===
It is important to keep lines of communication open between the stage manager and all other departments of the production.
* Technology

*** Actors' Equity requires a dedicated line in a production office, but most people in a cast and crew will have personal cell phones available
** Texting/Calling
*** The stage manager may need to text or call actors or crew members to give them reminders or check up on them if they are late for a call time.
** Email
*** Email can be useful for communication between production departments, sending reminders to cast and crew, or distribution of rehearsal reports and other materials
**** The SM might utilize a feedback loop - ask the recipients to reply to show they have received and understand the information
***** "Communication without feedback isn't communication, it's broadcasting." - Ed Baker
** Headset/walkie talkies
*** During tech, dress rehearsals, and the run of the show, the Stage Manager may need to be on headset to call cues and communicate with lights, sound, and any Assistant Stage Managers
** Call board
*** The call board might be an actual bulletin board backstage, or an electronic message board.  Usually the sign-in sheet for actors and crew will be located on the call board

=== Prompt Book ===
The prompt book contains the script from which the SM calls the show, labeled with light and sound cues.  It may also contain:
* Shift plot for props
* A pre-show schedule
* A pre-show checklist
* Light and sound cue breakdowns
* Rehearsal schedules
* Rehearsal and performance reports
* Confidential emergency health history
* Cast and crew contact sheet

*

== Regional differences ==

=== United States ===
In the United States, ''Stage Manager'' is a generic title that may be applied to anyone who performs stage management functions. On small shows, one person typically performs all the tasks of stage management, and is simply referred to as ''the stage manager''. Larger shows often need two or more stage managers. In such cases the head stage manager is titled Production Stage Manager (commonly abbreviated PSM), and working under the PSM is one or more Assistant Stage Managers (commonly abbreviated ASM). Shows that employ three stage managers have a PSM and two ASMs, though the program credits may list them as ''Production Stage Manager'' (first or head stage manager), ''Stage Manager'' (second stage manager), and ''Assistant Stage Manager'' (third stage manager).&lt;ref name=Fazio /&gt;

Some professional stage managers on plays and musicals may choose to be represented by a union known as the [[Actors' Equity Association]], which also represents performers. In addition to performing their typical stage management duties (e.g., maintaining the prompt book and calling performances), Equity stage managers are also required to uphold the union's rules and rights for Equity artists. Union stage managers for opera, ballet, and modern dance are represented by the American Guild of Musical Artists and perform most of the same duties as their counterparts in plays and musicals.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the structure of a stage management team depends on the type and size of the production. It can consist of stage manager (overseeing the running of the show), deputy stage manager (commonly called DSM), and assistant stage manager (commonly called ASM). A [[fringe theatre]] show may employ one stage manager to carry out the tasks of an entire team, whereas a [[West End theatre]] show in London might employ multiple ASMs. Professional stage managers are represented by the [[British Actors' Equity Association]], which also represents performers.

====Deputy stage manager====
The DSM prompts actors and will usually cue technical crew members and sometimes cast, while following the orders of the director and stage manager. The DSM calls actors to hold while technical problems are sorted out during rehearsal, and determines where in the script to restart halted scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Pallin, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The deputy stage manager (DSM) is a separate position in some theatres, while in others the responsibilities of the DSM may be assumed by the stage manager or assistant stage manager.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assistant stage manager====
The assistant stage manager (ASM) has varied responsibilities, which are assigned by the stage manager. The ASM assists in finding and maintaining props during rehearsals and the run of the show. The ASM may take attendance or estimate audience size, may manage the backstage technicians, may act as a liaison between crew, cast and management, and may call some cues. Mundane tasks such as mopping the stage and brewing coffee or tea may fall to the ASM. If the stage manager is unable to perform his or her duties, the ASM must be able to fill in.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; The assistant may also be in charge of one wing of the stage, while the stage manager is on the other wing.

==Show control based venues==
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2018}}
Many live shows around the world are produced with the forehand knowledge that they will have a very long run, often measured in years. These are usually known quantities that are very expensive productions and have a guaranteed audience because of their location. Often, they are on cruise ships, in theme parks, Las Vegas or at destination resorts. These shows warrant very long-range development and planning and use stage managers to run almost all technical elements in the show, without many of the other traditional crew members, such as sound, lighting and rigging operators. In these cases, [[show control]] systems are installed and connected to all other technical systems in the theatre, which are specifically designed to be controlled by show control and to operate safely with minimal supervision. Stage managers working these shows usually have the additional responsibility for programming the show control system, and often the other control systems as well.

== Different Areas of Stage Management ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2018}}
The role of stage manager evolved from an amalgamation of various positions in theater over several centuries and is still generally known for its integral relationship with theater. Many other types of productions and events have incorporated the position of stage management, however. Some of the most common are Opera, Music and Dance concerts and, Film and Television.

For music concerts, stage management includes a large variety of responsibilities depending on both the venue and the size and expertise of the musical group coming into the venue. Some of the responsibilities of a concert stage manager include overseeing the schedule for load in and out of equipment, seeing to the comfort of the group which can include arranging refreshments and or transportation, sometimes arranging how and where merchandise is to be sold at the venue, and above all, as with all areas of stage management, watching out for the safety of all participants in the experience including performers, audience, and any crews required.

==Synopsis==
A king and queen had no children, which grieved the queen greatly.  To alleviate the queen's loneliness, they adopted a girl to raise as their own.  One day, when the queen saw her adopted daughter playing with a beggar girl, she scolded her adopted daughter and tried to drive the other girl off.  However, the beggar girl mentioned that her mother knows a way for the queen to become pregnant.

When the queen approached the beggar woman, the woman denies having such knowledge.  The queen treated the woman to as much wine as the woman pleased until the woman is drunk.  When the queen asked the drunk beggar woman how she could get a child of her own, the beggar woman told her to wash herself in two pails of water before going to bed, and afterward pour the water under the bed. The next morning, two flowers will have sprung up from under the bed: one fair and one rare. The beggar tells the queen that she must eat the beautiful one, but not to eat the hideous one no matter what. The queen followed this advice, and the next morning under the bed were two flowers. One was bright and lovely, and the other was black and foul. The queen ate the beautiful flower at once, but it tasted so sweet that she craved the other and ate it as well.

Not long afterward, the queen bore a child. She gave birth to a girl who carried a wooden spoon in her hand and rode upon a goat. She was very ugly and loud from the moment she was born.  The queen despairs having such a daughter until the girl tells her mother that her next child will be fair and agreeable.  As the girl promised, the queen gave birth to a second daughter, one who was born fair and sweet, which pleased the queen very much. The sisters were as different as they could be, but they were very fond of each other.  The elder daughter was named Tatterhood, because she wore a tattered hood over her unruly hair.

One Christmas Eve, when the girls were half grown, there was great noise in the gallery outside the queen's rooms.  When Tatterhood demanded to know what was causing the noise, the queen reluctantly reveals that it was a pack of trolls (in some versions, witches) who come to the palace every seven years.  Tatterhood, being headstrong, decides to drive the trolls off and instructs her mother keep the door tightly shut.  Worried about Tatterhood, Tatterhood's younger sister opens one of the doors during the battle with the trolls.  Her head is instantly snatched off by a troll and replaced with a calf's head, after which the trolls flee from the castle.

To restore her sister's head, Tatterhood sets off in a ship with no crew or company aside from her own sister.  They arrive at the isle of the trolls and Tatterhood battles the trolls and successfully regain her sister's head.  The sisters escape and arrive in a distant kingdom.  The king, a widower with one son, fell in love with the younger sister at first sight.  However, she declared she will not marry until Tatterhood does.  The king begged his son to marry Tatterhood, and eventually he reluctantly agreed. 

The two sisters were to be married to their grooms on the same day. The king, his young princess bride, and the king's son were regally adorned, while Tatterhood refused to dress up and happily wore her rags. As the couples rode to church to be married, Tatterhood asked her bridegroom why he did not ask why she rides a goat, and when he duly asked, she answered that she rode a grand horse, which it promptly becomes. She asked the prince why he does not ask why she carries a wooden spoon, which he asks, and she declares it to be a fan (or in some versions a wand), which it turns into. This is repeated with the tattered hood, which is turned into a golden crown, and with Tatterhood herself, whose beauty she declares to surpass her sister's, which it then does. The prince now understands that she chooses to appear ragged, and that her beauty matters not.  He now is glad to be married to her.

[[File:Das_Jüngste_Gericht_(Memling).jpg|thumb|400px|[[Hans Memling]]'s ''Last Judgement'', c. late 1460s, [[National Museum, Gdańsk|National Museum]], [[Gdańsk]]]]

'''''The Last Judgment''''' is a [[triptych]] attributed to Flemish painter [[Hans Memling]] and painted between 1467 and 1471. It is now in the [[National Museum, Gdańsk|National Museum]] in [[Gdańsk]] in Poland. It was commissioned by [[Angelo Tani]], an agent of the [[Medici]] at [[Bruges]], but was captured at sea by [[Paul Beneke]], a [[privateer]] from Danzig. (A lengthy lawsuit against the [[Hanseatic League]] demanded its return to Italy.)  It was placed in the [[St. Mary's Church, Gdańsk|Basilica of the Assumption]] but in the 20th century it was moved to its present location.

The central panel shows Jesus sitting in judgment on the world, while [[St Michael the Archangel]] is weighing souls and driving the [[damnation|damned]] towards Hell.  (The sinner in St. Michael's right-hand scale pan is a [[donor portrait]] of [[Tommaso Portinari]].) On the left hand panel, the [[Beatific vision|saved]] are being guided into heaven by [[St Peter]] and angels. On the right-hand panel, the damned are being dragged to Hell.

'''''The Sceptical Feminist: A Philosophical Enquiry''''' (1980; second edition 1994) is a book about feminism by the philosopher [[Janet Radcliffe Richards]].

==Summary==
Richards argues against both opponents of feminism as well as much "common feminist dogma and practice."{{sfn|Richards|1994|page=21}}

==Publication history==
''The Sceptical Feminist'' was first published by [[Routledge|Routledge and Kegan Paul]] in 1980. In 1982, it was published in [[Pelican Books]]. In 1991, it was reprinted in [[Penguin Books]]. In 1994, the book was published with a new introduction and two new appendices.{{sfn|Richards|1994|page=4}}

==Reception==
''The Sceptical Feminist'' has been influential, but it has been criticized for being "too unworldly in its understanding of women's oppression, and insufficiently radical in the remedies it proposes." Susan Mendus writes that Richards provides little discussion of inequalities of power which perpetuate injustice, and accepts that "women's work" is less fulfilling and valuable than work outside the home, commenting, "Richards's feminism is logical rather than ideological, cerebral rather than celebratory."{{sfn|Mendus|2005|page=781}} The book was controversial within and outside feminism, in regard to standards of rationality,{{sfn|Battersby|1991|page=200}} fashion and style, and Richards' liberal stance.{{sfn|Whelehan|1995|pages=39–40}}

The philosopher [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] expressed agreement with some of Richards' arguments in ''[[Who Stole Feminism?]]'' (1994).{{sfn|Sommers|1994|pages=27, 278}}

''The Sceptical Feminist'' received a positive review from the philosopher [[Antony Flew]] in ''[[The Philosophical Quarterly]]''.{{sfn|Flew|1981|page=380}} The book was also reviewed by Emily Stoper in ''[[Journal of Women, Politics &amp; Policy|Women &amp; Politics]]'',{{sfn|Stoper|1983|pages=77–78}} and Christa Bausch in ''Sociology &amp; Social Research''.{{sfn|Bausch|1985|pages=274–275}}

Flew considered the book excellent and probably the best book on its topic, and its material relevant to questions of ethics in general as well as specifically to feminism. However, he considered one chapter "marred" to some extent by the intrusion of [[John Rawls]]'s ideas about justice, which in his view Richards had not fully understood, and criticized Richards for not devoting more space to criticizing Marxist feminists.{{sfn|Flew|1981|page=380}}

'''''Tintin and Alph-Art''''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|'''Tintin et l'alph-art'''}}) is the unfinished twenty-fourth and final volume of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', the comics series by Belgian cartoonist [[Hergé]]. Left incomplete on Hergé's death, the manuscript was posthumously published in 1986. The story revolves around [[Brussels]]' [[modern art]] scene, where the young reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] discovers that a local art dealer has been murdered. Investigating further, he encounters a conspiracy of art forgery, masterminded by a religious guru named Endaddine Akass.

Reflecting his own fascination for modern art, Hergé began work on ''Tintin and Alph-Art'' in 1978.  However, it was left unfinished at the time of his death in March 1983. At this point it consisted of around 150 pages of pencil-drawn notes, outlines and sketches&amp;nbsp;– not yet rendered in Hergé's trademark ''[[ligne claire]]'' drawing style&amp;nbsp;– with no ending having been devised for the story. Hergé's colleague [[Bob de Moor]]  offered to complete the story for publication, and while Hergé's widow Fanny Vlamynck initially agreed, she changed her decision, citing the fact that her late husband had not wanted anyone else to continue ''The Adventures of Tintin''. A selection of the original notes were collected together and published in book form by [[Casterman]] in 1986. Since that point, several other cartoonists, such as [[Yves Rodier]], have produced their own finished, unauthorized versions of the story. Critical reception of the work has been mixed; some commentators on ''The Adventures of Tintin'' have believed that ''Tintin and Alph-Art'' would have been an improvement over much of Hergé's later work, while others have characterised this as wishful thinking.

==Synopsis==
[[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and [[Captain Haddock]] receive a phone call from their friend, the opera singer [[Bianca Castafiore]], who informs them about a new spiritual leader whom she has begun following, [[Endaddine Akass]], stating her intention to stay at his villa in [[Ischia]]. Later that day, Haddock enters the Fourcart Gallery in Brussels, where Jamaican [[avant-garde]] artist [[Ramó Nash]] convinces him to purchase one of his "Alph-Art" works, a [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|perspex]] letter "H". The gallery's owner, [[Henri Fourcart]], arranges to meet Tintin, but is killed in a car accident while on his way to do so. Tintin begins to investigate, discovering that Fourcart's death was murder. Tintin and Haddock attend one of Akass' lectures; there, Tintin recognises Akass' voice, but is unsure why. Investigating further, he concludes that Akass was spying on Fourcart through a micro-transmitter hidden in a pendant worn by the latter's assistant, [[Martine Vandezande]]. Tintin soon faces a number of attacks designed to kill him, but survives both.{{sfn|Hergé|2004|pp=2–40}}

To further his investigations, Tintin decides to visit Akass' villa. Arriving at Ischia, Tintin and Haddock receive death threats warning them to leave. When Castafiore hears that they are on the island, she welcomes them to Akass' villa, informing them that Akass himself is in Rome. At the villa, they meet a number of acquaintances, the corrupt industrialists [[W.R. Gibbons]] (from ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'') and [[R.W. Trickler]] (from ''[[The Broken Ear]]''), Emir [[Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab|Ben Kalish Ezab]] (from ''[[Land of Black Gold]]''), Luigi Randazzo (a singer), and Ramó Nash. Tintin and Haddock stay the night at the villa on Castafiore's insistence. During the night, Tintin witnesses men loading canvases into a van, and exploring the villa discovers a room full of faked paintings by prominent artists. He is discovered by Akass, who informs him that he uses Nash's "Alph-Art" as a front for his criminal forgery business. Akass declares his intention to kill Tintin by having him covered in liquid [[polyester]] and sold as a work of art by [[César Baldaccini]].{{sfn|Hergé|2004|pp=40–52}}

==History==

===Background===

In 1976, a few months after the publication of ''[[Tintin and the Picaros]]'', Hergé told the journalist [[Numa Sadoul]] that he was contemplating setting the next ''Adventure of Tintin'' in an airport lounge.{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=1989|1p=129|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2p=202|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=326}} This idea was dropped, and in 1978, he decided to set the story in the world of [[modern art]].{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=1989|1p=130|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2p=84}} During his later years Hergé had grown increasingly interested in this subject, and decided to incorporate his love of [[avant-garde]] artwork into the new story.{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=1989|1p=130|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2pp=202–203}} Being a regular at Brussels' art galleries and exhibitions, he was able to draw directly upon his experiences in the art scene when producing the story.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=200}} Given his age, and the length of time that it was taking him to produce each ''Adventure'', British literary critic [[Michael Farr]] suggested that Hergé likely knew that this would be his final installment in the series.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=200}}

[[Image:Tintin and Alph-Art - final panel.png|left|thumb|The last panel in the book and in the series]]

Hergé initially titled this new work ''Tintin et les Faussaires'' ("Tintin and the Forgers") before changing this [[working title]] to ''Tintin et L'Alph-Art''.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=84}} The story's main antagonist, Endaddine Akass, was based on a real-life art forger, [[Fernand Legros]], whom Hergé had learned about through reading a biography of him.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=203|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=85|3a1=Farr|3y=2001|3p=203|4a1=Peeters|4y=2012|4p=332}} The Akass character was also influenced by an article about the Indian guru [[Rajneesh]] which Hergé had read in a December 1982 edition of the ''[[Paris Match]]''.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=336}} In Hergé's notes, he included the idea of revealing that Akass was Tintin's nemesis, [[Rastapopoulos]], in disguise, with Farr believing that this plot twist would have been revealed had Hergé completed the story.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=203}} Conversely, [[Harry Thompson]] suggested that Hergé had dropped Rastapopolous from the story in 1980.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=204}} Hergé's notes reveal that he considered various different names for the artist character, including Ramon Hasj and Ramo Nasj, before settling on Ramo Nash.{{sfn|Goddin|2011|p=194}} Similarly, he had initially debated whether Nash should be a painter or a sculptor, before deciding on the latter.{{sfn|Goddin|2011|p=194}}

Three months before he died, Hergé stated that "Unfortunately I cannot say much about this forthcoming Tintin adventure because, though I started it three years ago, I have not had much time to work on it and still do not know how it will turn out. I know very roughly where I am going... I am continuing my research and I really do not know where this story will lead me."{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=1989|1p=130|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=203}}
Upon his death, Hergé left around one hundred and fifty pages of pencil sketches for the story.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=84}} The story itself had no ending,{{sfn|Peeters|1989|p=131}} and is left on a [[cliffhanger]], with Tintin's fate left unexplained.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=199}}

Hergé's main assistant, [[Bob de Moor]], showed an interest in completing the book following Hergé's death.{{sfnm|1a1=Lofficier|1a2=Lofficier|1y=2002|1p=84|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=337}} In de Moor's words, "Personally I would have loved to finish ''Alph-Art''. It would have been a tribute to Hergé. Fanny Remi asked me to finish it, and I began work on it, but after a few months she changed her mind. I didn't insist, but for me it was logical that there was a studio, there were artists in the studio, Casterman asked for it to be finished, there were twenty-three finished books, that one story was not finished; so I had to finish it."{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=205}}
In the end, Fanny decided Hergé would not have approved and the book must remain unfinished.{{sfnm|1a1=Lofficier|1a2=Lofficier|1y=2002|1p=84|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=337}} Hergé had made it clear that he did not want anyone else to continue ''The Adventures of Tintin'' after his death,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=336}} informing Sadoul that "After me there will be no more Tintin. Tintin is my creation—my blood, my sweat, my guts."{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=205}}

===Publication===

Fanny ultimately decided that Hergé's unfinished sketches could be published in book form.{{sfn|Peeters|1989|p=131}} To do so, the sketches were edited by a team of experts, including [[Benoît Peeters]], Michel Bareau and Jean-Manuel Duvivier, with forty-four being selected for publication.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=85}} The book produced devoted one half to reproducing the sketches, and the other to producing a [[wikt:Special:Search/transcription|transcript]] of Hergé's text for the story.{{sfn|Peeters|1989|p=131}} Published on 8 October 1986 by [[Casterman]], it proved to be a best-seller.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|pp=84, 85}}
An English language translation was published in 1990.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=200}}

==Critical analysis==

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="Hergé's final, incomplete book ''Tintin and Alph-Art'' betrays in its massive self-reflexiveness a desire to be taken seriously, to be seen to be considering the highly conceptual issues in contemporary art with which its author is clearly ''au fait'', alongside a desire to mock the highness of the establishment that never accepted him as highbrow, to expose its pretentiousness, its fraudulence."|source=Tom McCarthy, 2006{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=31}}}}

For Michael Farr, ''Tintin and Alph-Art'' provided "an almost perfect ending to more than fifty years of defying danger, threats to his life and a succession of villains".{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=199}} He believed that it was "full of a vigour and enthusiasm disappointingly absent from the two previous adventures", and that as a result "it promised to be Hergé's most accomplished Tintin story for twenty years".{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=200}} [[Jean-Marc Lofficier]] and Randy Lofficier stated that had the story been completed, it "may have turned out to be a smaller-scale, unpretentious yet far more exciting and true-to-life adventure" than various recent volumes.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=86}}
Hergé biographer [[Benoît Peeters]] felt that "despite its limitations, and perhaps on account of them, this unfinished story fits perfectly alongside the other 23 Tintin adventures. Full of promise, it ends the series admirably by leaving the last word to every reader's imagination."{{sfn|Peeters|1989|p=131}} [[Philippe Goddin]] opined that ''Tintin and Alph-Art'''s opening "promised much, coming like new breath".{{sfn|Goddin|2011|p=200}}

In a later publication, Peeters expressed a different view, stating that "one cannot help but feel disappointed" with ''Alph-Art''.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=337}} Similarly, [[Harry Thompson]] expressed the view that Hergé would never have completed the story, and that while "many critics like to think... ''Tintin and Alph-Art'' was set to be Hergé's last great masterpiece", he disagreed, describing this as "surely just wishful thinking".{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=202}} He added that it could be seen as "a nostalgic, or regressive book, depending on your point of view."{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=203}}

The literary critic [[Tom McCarthy (novelist)|Tom McCarthy]] suggested that some of the early scenes of the book "take the form almost of [[Platonic dialogues]], dramatized theoretical discussions about art itself", although later in the book Hergé turns to revealing "the deeper and more essential Platonic truth of art: that it is fake, that its whole currency is fakeness."{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=158}} Discussing the final scene in the book, he opined that it "reads like a [[snuff movie]]: not of Tintin, ultimately, but of Hergé".{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=159}} Further, he argued that ''Tintin and Alph-Art'' reflected a number of themes that also appear in other ''Adventures of Tintin''; these include the idea of Castafiore bridging the connection between the protagonist and the villains,{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=46}} and the concept of Haddock being confronted "with his own inauthenticity", in this case through purchasing a giant plastic 'H' artwork.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=176}}

==Adaptations and exhibitions==
[[File:Rodier's Tintin and Alph-Art scene.png|thumb|right|300px|Frames from the opening page of Rodier's version of the book]]

A number of [[List of Tintin parodies and pastiches|pirated versions]] of the story exist, produced by other artists and illegally distributed among fans.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=86}} In 1987, such a version was completed by an artist using the pseudonym of Ramó Nash.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=86}} Several further versions were produced by the Canadian artist [[Yves Rodier]] during the 1990s.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=86}} A further version appeared in the 1990s, produced by an individual known as Regric.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=86}}

In honour of Hergé's legacy, the awards handed out at the [[Angoulême International Comics Festival]] were named Alph-Art Awards, having previously been named after [[Alain Saint-Ogan]]'s character Alfred.{{sfnm|1a1=McKinney|1y=2007|1p=71|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=337}}

In November 2015, [[Somerset House]] in London held the exhibition "Tintin: Hergé's Masterpiece", which featured the final sketch from ''Tintin and Alph-Art'' as one of its displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Clark |first=Nick |title=Tintin: 'Poignant' Final Image of Hergé's Much-Loved Character Goes on Display in London |date=11 November 2015 |website=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/tintin-poignant-final-image-of-herge-s-much-loved-character-goes-on-display-in-london-a6730866.html |accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=McDonagh |first=Melanie |title=Tintin: Hergé’s Masterpiece, exhibition review: A lot of pleasure in a small space |date=12 November 2015 |website=The Evening Standard |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/tintin-herg-s-masterpiece-exhibition-review-a-lot-of-pleasure-in-a-small-space-a3113111.html |accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tribute in Light in 2010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|In 2010, as seen from [[Brooklyn]].]]
The '''''Tribute in Light''''' is an art installation of 88 [[searchlight]]s placed six blocks south of the [[World Trade Center site|World Trade Center]] on top of the Battery Parking Garage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Tribute in Light|url=https://www.911memorial.org/tribute-light|website= 9/11 Memorial||publisher= National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|accessdate= June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New York City]] to create two vertical columns of light to represent the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]] in remembrance of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]].&lt;ref name=godark&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/11/will-the-tribute-in-light-go-dark-after-08/|publisher=New York Times|title=Will ''Tribute in Light'' Go Dark After ’08?|date=September 11, 2007|first=Sewell|last=Chan|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tribute in Light'' began initially as a temporary commemoration of the attacks in early 2002 but became an annual commemoration, currently produced on September 11th by the [[Municipal Art Society]] of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tribute in Light|url=http://creativetime.org/programs/archive/2002/tribute/main.html|website=creativetime.org|publisher=Creative Time, Inc.|accessdate=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/tribute_in_light_shines_bright_every_year_since_20.html | location= | work=NJ.com | first=John | last=Munson | title=Tribute in Light shines bright every year since 2002 | date=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tribute in Light|url=https://www.mas.org/programs/tribute-in-light/|website=mas.org|publisher=The Municipal Art Society of New York|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On clear nights, the lights can be seen from over {{Convert|60|mi}} away, visible in all of [[New York City]] and most of suburban [[North Jersey|Northern New Jersey]] and [[Long Island]]. The lights can also be seen in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], as well as [[Westchester County|Westchester]], [[Orange County, New York|Orange]], and [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] counties in [[New York State|New York]]. The beams have been clearly visible as far north as the terrace at Century Country Club in [[Purchase, New York]], from at least as far west as western [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]], in [[Flanders, New Jersey]], at least as far east as the barrier beach of [[Fire Island]] in [[Suffolk County, New York]] on Long Island, and as far south near [[Trenton, New Jersey]] in nearby [[Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2035010/9-11-anniversary-Tribute-Light-rises-New-York.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Lee | last=Moran | title=Twinkling tribute to the Twin Towers: World Trade Center rises in poignant pillars of light as New York makes final preparations for 9/11 anniversary | date=September 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two beams cost approximately $1,626 (assuming $0.11 per [[Kilowatt hour|kWh]]) to run for 24 hours. There are 88 xenon spotlights (44 for each tower) which each consume 7,000 [[watt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chaban|first1=Matt|title=The End of Tribute in Light: Memorial Goes Dark Forever on 9/12|url=http://observer.com/2011/08/the-end-of-tribute-in-light-memorial-goes-dark-forever-on-912/|website=observer.com|publisher=Observer|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Tribute in Light (10092).jpg|thumb|Tribute in Light set up atop Battery Parking Garage in 2018]]
The idea of two vertical beams of light was first suggested by Ezra Orion, an Israeli sculptor, in 1997. Orion proposed an art installation in which 120 Xenon searchlights were to be placed on the tops of the Twin Towers for the 1998 [[4th of July]] celebration.  On September 25th, 1997, Orion met with Richard Hart, the president of Xenotech Lighting, and the municipal art adviser, at the top of the south tower.  Although the response to Orion’s suggestion was enthusiastic, it was deemed too expensive. 

The ''Tribute in Light'' initially ran as a temporary installation from March 11 to April 14, 2002, and ran again on September 11, 2003 to mark the second anniversary of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/tribute_in_light_shines_bright_every_year_since_20.html | location= | work=NJ.com | first=John | last=Munson | title=Tribute in Light shines bright every year since 2002 | date=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has been repeated every year on September 11. It was announced that 2008 would be its final year,&lt;ref name=godark&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but the tribute was continued in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=NY1.com|title=September 11th Tribute Lights Up Again|url=http://ny1.com/content/top_stories/105290/september-11th-tribute-lights-up-again/Default.aspx"|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914135857/http://ny1.com/content/top_stories/105290/september-11th-tribute-lights-up-again/Default.aspx|archivedate=September 14, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 2009, it was confirmed that the tribute would continue through to the tenth anniversary of the attacks in 2011, but continued again in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/tribute-in-light-will-keep-shining-this-year-and-the-next//|publisher=New York Times|title=‘Tribute in Light’ Will Keep Shining, This Year and the Next|date=September 10, 2010|first=David W.|last=Dunlap|accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 23, 2012, plans are underway for the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] to assume the lease for the MTA property used during this tribute, and to begin transitioning operation of the tribute from the Municipal Art Society to the memorial foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Ted|title='Tribute' Handover|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443437504577545520666491842|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 23, 2012|accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those working on the project came up with the concept in the week following the attack.  On September 13, 2001, the concept was introduced by John Englehart in a meeting with the crisis communications task force at the electric utility [[Consolidated Edison]], as a signal of support for the community.  Architects John Bennett and Gustavo Bonevardi of PROUN Space Studio distributed their "Project for the Immediate Reconstruction of Manhattan's Skyline". Artists Julian LaVerdiere and Paul Myoda, who before September 11 were working on the 91st floor of the World Trade Center north tower on a proposed light sculpture on the giant radio antenna with [[Creative Time]], conceived of a project called "Phantom Towers". They were commissioned by ''[[The New York Times Magazine]],'' ([[Janet Froelich]], art director) to create an image of the project for its September 23 cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TRIBUTE IN LIGHT|url=http://creativetime.org/programs/archive/2002/tribute/main.html|website=creativetime.org|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Nash Gould, a New York architect, presented the concept to the [[Municipal Art Society]]. On September 19, Municipal Art Society chairman [[Philip K. Howard]] wrote to Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], asking him "to consider placing two large searchlights near the disaster site, projecting their light straight up into the sky."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mas.org/programs/tributeinlight/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825172813/http://mas.org/programs/tributeinlight/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 25, 2010|title=Tribute In Light –  The Municipal Art Society of New York|publisher=|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some consideration, it was decided to contact lighting experts in the field of high intensity light displays. A [[Las Vegas]]-based company, Light America, was chosen because of their vast knowledge of high intensity light displays. Gary Evans, the VP of Light America, and Michael Burns, the designer of the ''Tribute in Light'', said that the company did testing of the lighting fixtures in the [[Las Vegas Valley]] before bringing the fixtures to the World Trade Center site.

The project was originally going to be named ''Towers of Light'', but the victims' families felt that the name emphasized the buildings destroyed instead of the people killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1857699.stm|title=Tribute in light to New York victims|accessdate=April 27, 2008 | work=BBC News | date=March 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A permanent fixture of the ''Tribute in Light'' was at one point intended to be installed on the roof of [[One World Trade Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom Tower rendering Time-lapse|url=http://www.wtc.com/media/videos|publisher=Silverstein Properties Inc.|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOM Freedom Tower Fact Sheet|url=http://www.renewnyc.com/content/pdfs/freedom_tower_fact_sheet.pdf|publisher=Lower Manhattan Development Corporation|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not included in the finished design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Design changes to base, spire of 1 World Trade Center|url=http://www.myfoxny.com/story/19229185/new-renderings-of-1-wtc-show-design-changes|publisher=''Fox New York''|accessdate=March 22, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317171748/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/19229185/new-renderings-of-1-wtc-show-design-changes|archivedate=March 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, the generators that power ''Tribute in Light'' have been fueled with biodiesel made from used cooking oil collected from local restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bevill|first1=Kris|title=Tri-State Biodiesel fuels Sept. 11 memorial|url=http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/articles/2726/tri-state-biodiesel-fuels-sept.-11-memorial/|publisher=Biodiesel Magazine|accessdate=September 12, 2017|date=September 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Size inconsistency has existed since at least 1937. In [[Sears]]'s 1937 catalog, a [[dress size|size]] 14 dress had a bust size of  {{convert|32|in|cm}}. In 1967, the same bust size was a size 8. In 2011, it was a [[size 0]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clifford|first=Stepanie|title=One Size Fits Nobody: Seeking a Steady 4 or a 10|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/25/business/25sizing.html?_r=1|accessdate=13 July 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that vanity sizing is designed to satisfy wearers' wishes to appear thin and feel better about themselves.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,57672,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Flattery Gets Designers Everywhere | first=Jennifer | last=D'Angelo | date=15 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This works by adhering to the theory of compensatory self-enhancement, as vanity sizing promotes a more positive self-image of one upon seeing a smaller label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.wp.odu.edu/bodylore/2018/03/01/hidden-numbers-the-history-of-womens-clothing-sizes-in-the-u-s/|title=Hidden Numbers: The History of Women’s Clothing Sizes in the U.S. {{!}} Bodylore|website=sites.wp.odu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designer [[Nicole Miller]] introduced size 0 because of its strong California presence and to satisfy the request of many Asian customers. It introduced subzero sizes for naturally petite women.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; However, the increasing size of clothing with the same nominal size caused Nicole Miller to introduce size 0, 00, or subzero sizes.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; The UK's [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Officer]] has suggested that vanity sizing has contributed to the normalisation of obesity in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Howard |first=SJ |last2=Davies |first2=Sally C |date=27 March 2014 |title=Chief medical officer urges action to tackle overweight and obesity |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g2375 |journal=BMJ |volume=348 |doi=10.1136/bmj.g2375 |access-date=7 May 2016 |pmid=24677657 |pages=g2375}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2003, a study that measured over 1,000 pairs of women's [[pants]] found that pants from more expensive brands tended to be smaller than those from cheaper brands with the same nominal size.&lt;ref&gt;Kinley, TR (2003).

==Men's clothing==
Although more common in women's apparel, vanity sizing occurs in men's clothing as well. For example, men's pants are traditionally marked with two numbers, "waist" (waist circumference) and "[[inseam]]" (distance from the crotch to the hem of the pant). While the nominal inseam is fairly accurate, the nominal waist may be quite a bit smaller than the actual waist, in US sizes. In 2010, Abram Sauer of [[Esquire (magazine)|''Esquire'']] measured several pairs of dress pants with a nominal waist size of 36 at different US retailers and found that actual measurements ranged from 37 to 41 inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/mens-fashion/pants-size-chart-090710|title=Are Your Pants Lying to You? An Investigation|newspaper=Esquire|date=September 2010|first= Abram |last= Sauer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon has also been noticed in the United Kingdom, where a 2011 study found misleading labels on more than half of checked items of clothing. In that study, worst offenders understated waist circumferences by 1.5 to 2 inches. [[London]]-based market analyst [[Mintel]] say that the number of men reporting varying waistlines from store to store doubled between 2005 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/8739365/Wrong-trousers-on-the-High-Street-as-men-fall-victim-to-vanity-sizing.html|title=Wrong trousers on the High Street as men fall victim to 'vanity sizing' |newspaper=[[The Sunday Telegraph]]|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==

[[Trevor Phillips]] reviewed the work for ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Philips, Trevor |title=Books: Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge |website=The Telegraph }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', Bernadine Evaristo described the book's title as "gloriously provocative", noting that it was "marketing gold" in the climate surrounding the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement. Evaristo described the work as "timely and accessible", "comprehensive and journalistic" as well as "resolutely unacademic", comparing it to the work of African-American writer [[Roxane Gay]], whose 2014 anthology ''[[Bad Feminist]]'' "treads some of the same ground". However, she critiques Eddo-Lodge for not engaging in enough "rigorous research, particularly into the past" and for the fact that she "completely overlooks" the work of Black British feminist writers like Beverley Bryan, Stella Dadzie and Suzanne Scafe. Evaristo also noted that the book leaves open further questions, such as "What is the responsibility of black people in creating change for ourselves? Without also taking responsibility, we are dependent and powerless. What about the numerous positive developments since [[HMT Empire Windrush#West Indian immigrants|
''Windrush]]''?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=[[Bernardine Evaristo|Evaristo, Bernardine]] |title=Check Your Privilege |website=Times Literary Supplement |date=4 July 2017 |url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/reni-eddo-lodge-review/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Arifa Akbar reviewed the work for the ''[[Financial Times]]'', noting that Eddo-Lodge "builds on a critical tradition drawn from black American writers" like [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[James Baldwin]], and [[bell hooks]]. Akbar notes that "Not everyone will find the answer to racial inequality in Eddo-Lodge's reliance on white consciousness-raising, but it is an important shift that undermines the idea that racism is the BAME community's burden to carry. The liberation that this book offers is in the reversal of responsibilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Akbar, Arifa |date=26 May 2017 |website=Financial Times |title=Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge — review |url=https://www.ft.com/content/5afdae58-3fe6-11e7-82b6-896b95f30f58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Colin Grant (author)|Colin Grant]] places the book within a wider tradition of "angry warnings to an ignorant white readership", the majority of which have been produced by African-American rather than Black British writers. Grant opined that "Eddo-Lodge accurately takes the temperature of racial discussions in the UK" but that several sections, such as its discussion of the murder of Stephen Lawrence, are too brief, stating that "this kind of book is not designed to delve beyond the headlines in order to draw lessons from the past".&lt;ref name=Grant /&gt;

Reviewing the work for [[NPR]], the journalist Silvia Viñas stated that the work's "boldness" and "straight talk" is what makes it "memorable", also noting that while focusing "on events in Britain, it's still accessible to readers of black American history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Viñas, Silvia |title='Why I'm No Longer Talking To White People About Race' Is A Call To Action |date=14 November 2017 |website=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/11/14/563728725/why-im-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race-is-a-call-to-action }}&lt;/ref&gt;
