The '''A2030''' is a road in [[Hampshire]].  The road starts off at junction 5 of the [[A3 road|A3(M)]], near the village of [[Bedhampton]].  The road then runs west along the base of [[Portsdown Hill]], following the old route of the A27 into [[Portsmouth]] until it reaches the [[Drayton, Portsmouth|Drayton]] area.  This section of road is called '''Havant Road'''.

It then turns sharply south and begins to run down towards the main areas of Portsmouth on [[Portsea Island]].  Just before crossing onto Portsea Island is a busy junction with the current [[A27 road|A27]].  The road then continues along the east coast of the island before bearing right coming to a junction with Milton Road.  This section of the road is known as Eastern Road, apart from the southernmost 100 m which is called Velder Avenue.

From here it winds its way across Portsmouth, changing names a number of times, before terminating at a junction with the [[A3 road|A3]] in Portsmouth City centre.

Being one of only three roads between Portsea Island and the mainland, it is always busy and often becomes congested during rush hours.

'''al-Qaeda in the Kurdish Battalions (AQKB)''' is a militant Islamist organization, primarily active in the northern [[Iran–Iraq border]]. It is the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] branch of [[al-Qaeda]] that has launched several attacks on the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] in northern Iraq. The group was classified as a [[terrorist organization]] by the [[US State Department]] on January 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terrorist Designation of the al-Qaida Kurdish Battalions|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/01/180166.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
AQKB was founded in 2007, after the apparent disbandment of [[Ansar al-Islam]], another al-Qaeda-affiliated group. The group is considered to be relatively small, but it has camps in the Iranian towns of [[Mariwan]] and [[Sanandaj]].&lt;ref name="rudaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/world/4306.html |title=Rudaw in English The Happening: Latest News and Multimedia about Kurdistan, Iraq and the World - US Designates Kurdish Group Terrorists |publisher=Rudaw.net |date=2012-01-15 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks==
The group has launched several attacks, including its largest one being against [[Kurdistan Regional Government|KRG]]'s Ministry of Interior in [[Erbil]] that killed 19 people in May 2007.&lt;ref name="rudaw"/&gt; AQKB killed 7 border guards and one [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan|PUK]] security officer in Penjwan in July 2007.&lt;ref name="aina"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20120105102642.htm |title=Terrorist Designation of the Al-Qaida Kurdish Battalions |publisher=Aina.org |date=2012-01-05 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, two police officers were hurt by a failed suicide attack in [[Sulaymaniyah]].&lt;ref name="aina"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6335">'''Arewa''' is a [[Hausa language]] term for north, one of the cardinal directions.  Its popular usage in contemporary [[Nigeria]] sometimes suggests a northern Nigerian regionalism or proto-nationalism.  In both Nigeria and [[Niger Republic]], '''Arewa''' is the name of very specific historical entities: in Niger and Nigeria a pre-colonial state, and in Nigeria a small local government region.

==Specific meanings==
In Nigeria, it simply refers to the local term for geopolitical area north of [[River Niger]] and [[River Benue]] that geographically split Nigeria into north, west and east.   
In Niger, it has a very specific meaning. [[Arewa (Niger)]] is a small pre-colonial animist dominated state of the [[Dallol Maouri]] valley,  known for the indigenous "Maouri"/"Mawri" Hausa culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tarbiyya-tatali.org/?Arewa-s-region Arewa-s-region], tarbiyya-tatali.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Decalo1997"&gt;{{Cite book

In Nigeria, [[Arewa Dandi]] is a "Local Government Area" in [[Kebbi State]], and has been called simply "''Arewa''" in the past.

Arewa is taking the destiny of its economy in a renewed way:
The Arewa we love to see in couple of years: 
www.arewaonline-ng.com 
Arewa (Northern Nigeria) region is the fastest developing region in Africa, leading in planning and executing strategies, enhancing its position as the African business and investment destination, welcoming businesses seeking a strategic base in Nigeria from which to implement their growth strategies and to manage and integrate their operations for Nigeria, Africa and beyond. Arewa is experiencing new waves of activities that drive innovation, knowledge and creativity. The State Governors within the region believe in collaboration, partnership and commitment toward a common goal, which lead to the creation of the Region’s Economic Development Plan that creates value-adding solutions and incentives for investors and companies in Arewa to ensure sustainable economic growth, vibrant business growth and good job opportunities. Arewa mission will continue to evolve under strong Northern States Governor’s Forum (NSGF) leadership.

“Given the emergence of new regional dynamics in development policy and practice, Arewa region MUST fine-tune current regional development perspectives and to develop new ones that are not only more in sync with the present and future global context but with the governance systems being currently adopted that are becoming more and more decentralized and grassroots oriented. States Governors within the Arewa region must come together to create and adopt the Arewa Regional Economic Development Plan with emphasis on a balanced approach to development and opportunity for all, irrespective of one’s tribe, social class, religious belief and even political affiliation; and establish targets for economic growth of the entire region. The economic plan should be built on current regional opportunities, collaboration and innovation linking States macroeconomic models with regional development and economic plan termed: Regional Econometric Model”…President ACRD

==Nigarewaerian regionalist usage==
[[File:Speculative flag of Arewa Republic.png|thumb|Speculative flag of [[Arewa Republic]]]]

In post independence Nigeria, some use the word as a general term for Nigerian [[Hausaland]]: a contraction of "''Arewacin Nijeriya''" (Northern Nigeria). Much of the north was once politically united in the [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]], a federal division disbanded in 1967, and was previously home of the seven [[Hausa states]], later the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] in the pre-colonial period, and the [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]] under British colonial rule.
 
Northern Nigeria regionalist groups, such as the [[Arewa Consultative Forum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arewaconsultativeforum.org/ arewaconsultativeforum.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614025045/http://www.arewaconsultativeforum.org/ |date=June 14, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A good critical discussion on the genesis of the ACF can be found in 
*Nneoma V. Nwogu. Shaping truth, reshaping justice: sectarian politics and the Nigerian truth commission. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2007 {{ISBN|0-7391-2249-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Arewa Media Forum]] based in [[Kaduna]], and the related [[Arewa House]] and [[Arewa People's Congress]] are examples of this usage. These groups do not advocate independence from Nigeria, and focus on cultural unity of the so-called [[Hausa–Fulani]] community which forms the majority in the north of the nation. 

Within even smaller regionalist circles, the term [[Arewa Republic]] is used as to describe a speculative future region, entity, or state that coincides with the pre-1967 [[Northern Region, Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nairaland.com/nigeria/topic-209973.0.html Speculative regionalist discussions can be found on message boards, such as this], at nairaland.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunnewsonline.com/webpages/features/powergame/2008/sept/07/powergame-07-09-2008-003.htm Powergame]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},  Sun News (Nigeria).  7 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunnewsonline.com/webpages/opinion/2009/mar/02/backpage.html Editorial]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2556">'''Bartolomeo Marchionni''' (late 15th to early 16th century) was a [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] [[merchant]] established in [[Lisbon]] during the [[Age of Discovery]]. 

Bartolomeo Marchionni arrived circa 1468 at Lisbon as an agent to the [[Bracci-Cambini|Cambini]]. In a long career he became the most successful merchant&lt;ref&gt;K. J. P. Lowe, "Cultural links between Portugal and Italy in the Renaissance", p.8, Oxford University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the richest men in Lisbon at the time. He was the chief merchant in [[sugar]] from [[Madeira]] islands and participated extensively in the voyages to Guinea, Brazil, Madeira, and would finance several voyages to India &lt;ref&gt;"The voyage of Pedro Álvares Cabral to Brazil and India: from contemporary documents and narratives" p.146, Issue 81 of Works issued by the Hakluyt Society, William Brooks Greenlee, Asian Educational Services, 1995, {{ISBN|81-206-1040-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1500, in a joint enterprise with [[Álvaro of Braganza|Dom Álvaro of Portugal]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]], Bartolomeo Marchionni sent a ship second fleet to India that discovered Brazil under the command of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]].&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Lacerda "Os Capitães das Armadas da Índia no reinado de D. Manuel I – uma análise social". Lisboa, 2006 (in Portuguese) [http://cham.fcsh.unl.pt/files/varia/tese_teresa.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1501 he financed the [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|third Portuguese ''armada'' (expedition) to India]], under a joint private initiative with Portuguese Dom Álvaro of Braganza.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjay Subrahmanyam, "The Career and Legend of Vasco da Gama", p.182, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-47072-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small four vessel fleet departed from Lisbon in 9 or 10 March 1501, under command of [[João da Nova]], having [[Duarte Barbosa|Diogo Barbosa]] as Dom Álvaro agent. They established a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria (trading post)]]'' in [[Cananor]], leaving there a [[factor (agent)|factor]]. He was a friend of [[Americo Vespucci]]. He was followed by his son Pêro Paulo Marchionni, himself a shipowner. In the 1503 fleet to India under Francisco and [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], [[Empoli|Giovanni da Empoli]] was sent as a commercial agent of the firms Gualterroti and Frescobaldi and also Bartolomeo Marchionni.

'''Cabo da Roca''' (''Cape Roca'') is a [[Headlands and bays|cape]] which forms the [[Extreme points of Europe|westernmost extent]] of mainland [[Portugal]], continental [[Europe]] and the [[Eurasia|Eurasian land mass]]. The cape is in the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] municipality of [[Sintra Municipality|Sintra]], near [[Azóia (Sintra)|Azóia]], in the southwest of the district of [[Lisbon (district)|Lisbon]], forming the westernmost extent of the [[Sintra Mountains|Serra de Sintra]].&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.original.britannica.com/eb/article-9063940/Cape-Roca |title=Cape Roca |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-08-12 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cabo da Roca was known to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] as ''Promontorium Magnum''&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt; and during the [[Age of Sail]] as the Rock of Lisbon.

==Geography==
[[File:Cabo da Roca monument.JPG|thumb|left|235px|Monument declaring Cabo da Roca as the westernmost extent of continental Europe]]
[[File:Cabo da Roca (1) - Mar 2010.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The granite boulders and sea cliffs along the coast]]
[[File:Cabo da Roca08.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The invasive [[Carpobrotus edulis]] spread onto the plateau of the Cape]]
The cape is within the [[Sintra-Cascais Natural Park]], 42 kilometres west of the city of [[Lisbon]] and in the southwest of [[Sintra Municipality|Sintra]]. A location ({{coord|38|47|N|9|30|W|region:PT_type:landmark}}) is inscribed on a stone plaque, located on a monument at the site.

The western coast is a mixture of sand beaches and rocky cliff promontories: around Cabo da Roca, cliffs are more than 100 metres in height, and cut into crystalline rocks, composed of strongly folded and faulted sedimentary units. These forms are disturbed by dikes and small beaches.&lt;ref&gt;Anja Scheffers and Dieter Kelletat (2005), p.6&lt;/ref&gt; This promontory of "high" beaches is the extreme western immersion of the ancient eruptive Sintra massif, as evident from the rose-coloured [[granite]] in the north and [[syenite]] of the Ribeira do Louriçal in the south. In the vicinity of the Cape, there are geomorphological examples of gabbro-[[diorite]], volcanic [[breccia]], and granite.

Part of the granite formations show evidence of strong coastal erosion, while in other areas there are limestone deposits embedded in the granite.&lt;ref&gt;António Oliveira Fonseca (2010), p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the vegetation on this cape is low-lying and adapted to saltwater and windy conditions. Once home to a variety of plant life, Cabo da Roca has been overrun with the invasive plant species ''[[Carpobrotus edulis]]''. This creeping, mat-forming plant, a member of the [[Aizoaceae]] [[succulent]] family, was introduced as ground cover by local residents several decades ago, but now covers much of the arable land on Cabo da Roca.

Many migratory and marine birds roost temporarily along the cliffs and protected coves of the coastal area.

The '''Cape Peninsula''' ({{lang-af|Kaapse Skiereiland}}) is a generally rocky [[peninsula]] that juts out into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at the south-western extremity of the [[Africa]]n continent. At the southern end of the peninsula are [[Cape Point]] and the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. On the northern end is [[Table Mountain]], overlooking [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. The peninsula is 52&amp;nbsp;km long from Mouille point in the north to Cape Point in the south.&lt;ref&gt;1:250,000 Geological Series map 3318:Cape Town, Government Printer, Pretoria, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Benguela and Agulhas Currents 2.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|The courses of the  warm Agulhas current (red) along the east coast of South Africa, and the cold Benguela current (blue) along the west coast. Note that the Benguela current does not originate from Antarctic waters in the South Atlantic Ocean, but from upwelling of water from the cold depths of the Atlantic Ocean against the west coast of the continent. The two currents do not "meet" anywhere along the south coast of Africa.]]The Peninsula has been an [[island]] on and off for the past 5&amp;nbsp;million years, as sea levels fell and rose with the [[Glacial period|ice age]] and [[interglacial]] global warming cycles of, particularly, the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name=compton&gt;Compton, John S. (2004) ''The Rocks &amp; Mountains of Cape Town''. Cape Town: Double Story. {{ISBN|978-1-919930-70-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last time that the Peninsula was an island was about 1.5&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name=compton /&gt; Soon afterwards it was joined to the mainland by the [[Marine geology of the Cape Peninsula and False Bay|emergence from the sea]] of the sandy area now known as the [[Cape Flats]]. The towns and villages of the Cape Peninsula and Cape Flats now form part of the [[City of Cape Town Metropolitan Municipality]].

The [[Cape of Good Hope]] is sometimes given as the meeting point of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s. Thus the west coast of the Peninsula is invariably referred to as the "Atlantic Coast",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discoverthecape.com/atlantic-coast.html&lt;/ref&gt; but the eastern side is known as the "False Bay Coast". It is at [[Cape Point]] (or the Cape of Good Hope) that the ocean to the south is often said to be divided into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west, and the [[Indian Ocean]] to the east.  However, according to the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] agreement that defines the ocean boundaries, the meeting point is at [[Cape Agulhas]], about 200&amp;nbsp;km (120&amp;nbsp;mi) to the southeast.&lt;ref&gt;http://ioc.unesco.org/oceanteacher/OceanTeacher2/01_GlobOcToday/03_GeopolOc/s23_1953.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southafrica.info/about/geography/oceansmeet.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Cape Point]] is not the fixed "meeting point" of the cold [[Benguela Current]], running northwards along the west coast of Africa, and the warm [[Agulhas Current]], running south from the equator along the east coast of Africa. In fact the south flowing Agulhas Current swings away from the African coastline between about [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]] and [[Port Elizabeth]], from where it follows the edge of the [[Continental shelf]] roughly as far as the southern tip of the [[Agulhas Bank]], 250&amp;nbsp;km (155&amp;nbsp;miles) south of Cape Agulhas.&lt;ref name=Branch&gt;Branch, M &amp; Branch G. (1981). ''The Living Shores of Southern Africa.'' pp. 14-18. Struik Publishers, Cape Town.&lt;/ref&gt; From there it is retroflexed (turned sharply round) in an easterly direction by the [[South Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic]], [[Indian Ocean|South Indian]] and [[Southern Ocean]] currents, known as the "[[West Wind Drift]]", which flow eastwards round Antarctica. The Benguela Current, on the other hand, is an [[upwelling]] current which brings cold, mineral-rich water from the depths of the Atlantic Ocean to the surface along the west coast of Southern Africa. Having reached the surface it flows northwards as a result of the prevailing wind and [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis forces]]. The Benguela Current, therefore, effectively starts at Cape Point, and flows northwards from there,&lt;ref name=Branch /&gt;&lt;ref name=tyson&gt;Tyson, P.D., Preston-Whyte, R.A. (2000) ''The Weather and Climate of Southern Africa''. pp. 221-223. Oxford University Press, Cape Town&lt;/ref&gt;  although further out to sea it is joined by surface water that has crossed the South Atlantic from South America as part of the [[South Atlantic Gyre]].&lt;ref name=tyson /&gt;  Thus the Benguela and Agulhas currents do not strictly "meet" anywhere, although eddies from the Agulhas current do from time to time round the Cape to join the Benguela Current.&lt;ref name=Branch /&gt;&lt;ref name=tyson /&gt;

==Ecology==

[[Table Mountain National Park]], previously known as the Cape Peninsula National Park, was proclaimed on 29 May 1998, for the purpose of protecting the natural environment of the Table Mountain Chain, and in particular the rare [[fynbos]] vegetation. The park comprises a large part of the undeveloped area of the Cape Peninsula, and is managed by [[South African National Parks|South African National Parks Board]]. The coastal waters surrounding the Cape Peninsula are proclaimed as a marine protected area since 2004, and include several no-take zones, and are part of the national park. The waters of this marine protected area are unusual in that they are parts of two fairly distinct marine [[bioregion]]s, namely the [[Agulhas Bank|Agulhas Bioregion]] and the [[South-western Cape Bioregion]]. The boundary is at Cape Point.

The Cape Peninsula has an unusually rich biodiversity. Its vegetation consists predominantly of several different types of the unique and rich Cape [[Fynbos]]. The main vegetation type is endangered [[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]],  but [[critically endangered]] [[Peninsula Granite Fynbos]], [[Peninsula Shale Renosterveld]] and [[Afromontane|Afromontane forest]] occur in smaller portions on the mountain ranges of the Peninsula. On the sandy Cape Flats lowlands there are a few pockets of protected [[Cape Flats Sand Fynbos]].

The Peninsula's vegetation types form part of the [[Cape Floral Region]] protected areas. These protected areas are a [[World Heritage Site]], and an estimated 2,200 species of plants are confined to Table Mountain range - which are at least as many as occur in the whole of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=manning1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manning|first1=John|title=In: Field Guide to Fynbos|date=2007|publisher=Struik Publishers|location=Cape Town| isbn=9781770072657|pages=8–23|url= |lpg= |chapter=The World of Fynbos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maytham&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trinder-Smith|first1=Terry|title=In: Wild Flowers of the Table Mountain National Park|date=2006|publisher=Botanical Society of South Africa|location=Cape Town| isbn=1874999600|pages=19–35|url= |lpg= |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these species, including a great many types of [[protea]]s, are endemic to these mountains and can be found nowhere else. The [[Disa uniflora]], despite its restricted range within the [[Western Cape]], is relatively common in the perennially wet areas (waterfalls, streamlets and seeps) on Table Mountain and the Back Table, but hardly anywhere else on the Cape Peninsula.&lt;ref name=terry /&gt;&lt;ref name=manning2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manning|first1=John|title=In: Field Guide to Fynbos|date=2007|publisher=Struik Publishers|location=Cape Town| isbn=9781770072657|pages=162–163|url= |lpg= |chapter=Disa}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a very showy orchid that blooms from January to March on the [[Cape Peninsula#Geology|Table Mountain Sandstone regions of the mountain]]. Although they are quite widespread on the Back Table, the best (most certain, and close-up) place to view these beautiful blooms is in the "Aqueduct" off the Smuts Track, halfway between Skeleton Gorge and [[Maclear's Beacon]].

Remnant patches of [[Southern Afrotemperate Forest|indigenous forest]] persist in the wetter ravines. However, much of the indigenous forest was felled by the early European settlers for fuel for the lime kilns needed during the construction of [[Castle of Good Hope|the Castle]].&lt;ref name=Dan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sleigh|first1=Dan|title=Islands|date=2002|publisher=Secker &amp; Warburg|location=London| isbn=0436206323|page=429|url= |lpg= |chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact extent of the original forests is unknown, though most of it was probably along the eastern slopes of [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]], Table Mountain and the Back Table where names such as Rondebosch, Kirstenbosch, Klaassenbosch and Witteboomen survive (in Dutch "bosch" means forest; and "boomen" means trees) . Hout Bay (in Dutch "hout" means wood) was another source of timber and fuel as the name suggests.&lt;ref name=Dan /&gt; In the early 1900s commercial pine plantations were planted on these slopes all the way from the Constantiaberg to the front of Devil’s Peak, and even on top of the mountains, but these have now been largely cleared allowing fynbos to flourish in the regions where the indigenous Afromontane forests have not survived, or never existed.

Fynbos is a fire adapted vegetation, and evidence suggests that in the absence of regular fires all but the drier fynbos would become dominated by trees.&lt;ref name=manning1 /&gt;&lt;ref name= pauw&gt;{{cite book |last1= Pauw |first1= Anton |last2=Johnson |first2= Steven |chapter= The Power of Fire|title= in: Table Mountain| publisher= Fernwood Press|year= 1999 |pages= 37–53 |location= Vlaeberg, South Africa | isbn= 1 874950 43 1  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular fires have dominated fynbos for at least the past 12&amp;nbsp;000 years largely as a result of human activity.&lt;ref name=maytham /&gt;&lt;ref name=kraaij&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kraaij |first1= Tineke |last2=van Wilgen |first2=Brian W.|chapter= Drivers, ecology, and management of fynbos fires.|editor1-last=Allsopp |editor1-first=Nicky |editor2-last= Colville|editor2-first=Jonathan F. | editor3-last=Verboom |editor3-first=G.

Considerable efforts have been made to control the rapid spread of these invasive alien trees.

[[File:Dassie 2.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|The [[Rock hyrax|Cape hyrax]] or "dassie" as it is known in South Africa. It is the [[Verreaux's eagle]]'s favourite and almost exclusive prey on the Cape Peninsula.]]

===Fauna===
{{see also|List of marine animals of the Cape Peninsula and False Bay|Table Mountain National Park}}
The most common mammal on the mountain was the ''[[dassie]]'' (the South African name, from [[Afrikaans]], pronounced "dussy"), or [[rock hyrax]]. Between about 2000 and 2004 (no one is certain about the exact year or years) their numbers suddenly plummeted for unknown reasons. They used to cluster around the restaurant at the upper cable station, near areas where tourists discarded or (inadvisably supplied) food. The population crash of the dassies was in all probability responsible for the decline in the [[Verreaux's eagle]] population on the Peninsula, which is believed to have consisted of 3 breeding pairs during the period 1950 to 1990, with only 2 pairs, maximally, ever having been reported to fledge a chick each in any given year.&lt;ref&gt;Information gleaned from reports in the Cape Bird Club's newsletters from the 1950s onwards&lt;/ref&gt; With the commencement of formal monitoring in 1993, two breeding pairs were recorded on the Cape Peninsula Mountain Chain in 2004: one below the upper cable station at the western end of Table Mountain, in Blinkwater Ravine, the other on the cliffs below Noordhoek Peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jenkins |first1=A.R. |last2=van Zyl |first2=A.J. |title=Conservation status and community structure of cliff-nesting raptors and ravens on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa |journal=Ostrich | publication-date=2005 |volume=76 |pages=175–184 |ISSN=  0030-6525 |doi=10.2989/00306520509485490}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nest near the cable station was abandoned in 2006, leaving only the Noordhoek pair, which continued to fledge chicks reasonably regularly till 2013, at which point one member of the pair disappeared. From 2013 till January 2017 only a single Verreaux's Eagle, presumed to be a female, remained on the Peninsula. She continued to maintain the nest under Noordhoek Peak, but seemed unable to attract a mate. But in early 2017 a pair of eagles was seen by at least 7 independent observers during the course of 10 days (27 January - 5 February). It remains to be seen whether they will breed later in the year. Dassies are an important part the Verreaux's eagle's prey on the Peninsula.&lt;ref name=hockey&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hockey |editor1-first=P. A. R. |editor2-last=Dean |editor2-first=W. R.

They were then seen  in the [[Silvermine Nature Reserve|Silvermine]] region of the [[Table Mountain National Park]], and in 2015 at the restaurant on the top of the western end of Table Mountain, as well as elsewhere in the mountains. But even in 2017 dassies are still not as abundant as they were on the Peninsula Mountain Chain in the 1990s.|group=nb}})

Table Mountain is also home to [[Cape Porcupine|porcupines]], [[mongoose]]s, [[snake]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[tortoise]]s, and a rare endemic species of [[amphibian]] that is only found on Table Mountain, the [[Table Mountain ghost frog]]. The last [[lion]] in the area was shot circa 1802. [[Leopard]]s persisted on the mountains until perhaps the 1920s but are now extinct locally. Two smaller, secretive, nocturnal carnivores, the ''rooikat'' ([[caracal]]) and the ''vaalboskat'' (also called the vaalkat or [[Southern African wildcat]]) were once common in the mountains and the mountain slopes. The rooikat continues to be seen on rare occasions by mountaineers but the status of the vaalboskat is uncertain. The mountain cliffs are home to several raptors species, apart from the Verreaux's eagle. They include the [[jackal buzzard]], [[booted eagle]] (in summer), [[African harrier-hawk]], [[peregrine falcon]] and the [[rock kestrel]].&lt;ref name=hockey /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jenkins |first1=Andrew |last2=van Zyl |first2=Anthony |title=Home on the range. Raptor riches of the Cape Peninsula |journal=Africa Birds &amp; Birding | publication-date=2002 |volume=7 |pages=38–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 three pairs of [[African fish eagles]] were believed to be breeding on the Peninsula, but they nest in trees generally as far away from human habitation as is possible on the Peninsula. Their number in 2017 is unknown.

Up until the late 1990s [[Chacma baboon|baboon]]s occurred on all the mountains of the Peninsula, including the Back Table immediately behind Table Mountain. Since then they have abandoned Table Mountain and the Back Table, and only occur on the Constantiaberg, and the mountains to the south. They have also abandoned the tops of many of the mountains, in favour of the lower slopes, particularly when these were covered in pine plantations which seemed to provide them with more, or higher quality food than the [[fynbos]] on the mountain tops. However these new haunts are also within easy reach of Cape Town's suburbs, which brings them into conflict with humans and dogs, and the risk of traffic accidents. In 2014 there were a dozen troops on the Peninsula, varying in size from 7 to over 100 individuals, scattered on the mountains from the Constantiaberg to Cape Point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baboonsonline.org/bru/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811215937/http://www.baboonsonline.org/bru/ |archivedate=2014-08-11 |df= }} Cape Peninsula Baboon Research Unit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=baboon&gt;http://www.ncc-group.co.za/case-studies/managing-baboon-human-conflict-city-cape-town Managing Baboon-human conflict: City of Cape Town&lt;/ref&gt; The baboon troops are the subject of intense research into their movements (both of individuals and of the troops), their physiology, genetics, social interactions and habits. In addition, their sleeping sites are noted each evening, so that monitors armed with paint ball guns can stay with the troop all day, to ward them off from wandering into the suburbs. From when this initiative was started in 2009 the number of baboons on the Peninsula has increased from 350 to 450, and the number of baboons killed or injured by residents has decreased.&lt;ref name=baboon /&gt;
[[File:Rau Quagga on Devils Peak.jpg|thumb|left|320 px|Rau quagga in the animal camp on the slopes of [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]], above Groote Schuur Hospital.]]
[[Himalayan tahr]]s, fugitive descendants of tahrs that escaped from [[Groote Schuur Zoo]] near the University of Cape Town, in 1936, used to be common on the less accessible upper parts of the mountain. As an exotic species, they were almost eradicated through a culling programme initiated by the [[South African National Parks]] to make way for the reintroduction of indigenous [[klipspringer]]s. Until recently there were also small numbers of [[fallow deer]] of European origin and [[sambar deer]] from southeast Asia. These were mainly in the [[Rhodes Memorial]] area but during the 1960s they could be found as far afield as Signal Hill. These animals may still be seen occasionally despite efforts to eliminate or relocate them.

On the lower slopes of [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]], above [[Groote Schuur Hospital]], an animal camp bequeathed to the City of Cape Town by [[Cecil John Rhodes]] has been used in recent years as part of the [[Quagga Project]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quaggaproject.org/ The Quagga Project South Africa&lt;/ref&gt; The [[quagga]]s used to roam the Cape Peninsula, the [[Karoo]] and the [[Free State (province)|Free State]] in large numbers, but were hunted to extinction during the early 1800s. The last quagga died in an Amsterdam zoo in 1883. In 1987 a project was launched by [[Reinhold Rau]] to [[back-breeding|back-breed]] the quagga, after it had been established, using [[mitochondrial DNA]] obtained from museum specimens, that the quagga was closely related to the [[plains zebra]], and on 20 January 2005 a foal considered to be the first quagga-like individual because of a visible reduced striping was born. These quagga-like zebras are officially known as Rau quaggas, as no one can be certain that they are anything more than quagga look-alikes. The animal camp above Groote Schuur Hospital has several good looking Rau quaggas, but they are unfortunately not easily seen except from within the game camp, which is quite large and undulating, and the animals are few. The animal camp is not open to the public.

[[File:Erosion A5.svg|thumb|right|300 px|A west-east (left to right) geological cross section through Table Mountain on the Cape Peninsula, the Cape Flats (the isthmus connecting the Peninsula to the African mainland) and the [[Hottentots-Holland]] Mountains on the mainland. It indicates how the Cape Fold Mountains have been eroded in this region, leaving what was once the bottom of a valley to form Table Mountain with its flat table-top structure.&lt;ref name=compton /&gt;]]

The Cape Peninsula is underlain by the oldest rocks in the area, the [[Marine geology of the Cape Peninsula and False Bay#The geological structure of the region|Malmesbury Group]], and the [[granite]] intrusions of the ''Peninsula pluton''.

The Malmesbury Group has been dated from between 830 and 980&amp;nbsp;Mya, and was deformed during the [[Saldanian orogenic cycle]], both before and during the granite intrusions of 630 to 500&amp;nbsp;Mya, and there are minor intrusions which precede the granite. The base of this group has not been exposed.&lt;ref name="sheet 3318"&gt;Theron, J.N. Gresse, P.G. Siegfried, H.P. and Rogers, J. ''Explanation sheet 3318 – The Geology of the Cape Town Area''. Geological Survey, Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs, Government Printer, Pretoria 1992. {{ISBN|978-0-621-14284-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basal rocks were eroded to a relatively featureless [[peneplain]] with exposed granites covering most of the peninsula south of [[Lion's Head (Cape Town)|Lion's Head]] and [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]]. The ''Sea-Point contact zone'', described by [[Charles Darwin]] is a well known region of [[metamorphic rock]]s formed by the (originally very hot) granite intrusion into the Malmesbury rocks.&lt;ref name=compton /&gt;

These rocks were later [[Unconformity|unconformably]] covered by the [[Cape Fold Belt#Cape Supergroup|Cape Supergroup]]. The Cape Supergroup is divided into eight formations, the three oldest of which are present on the Peninsula. The lowest present is the reddish ''Graafwater formation'' which consist of [[shales]] and [[sandstone]]. The Graafwater Formation can be clearly seen in the cutting on the second hairpin bend as the [[Ou Kaapse Weg]] (road) goes up the slope from Westlake on to the Silvermine plateau. In the cutting one can also see the abrupt and obvious transition into the [[Table Mountain Sandstone (Geological Formation)|Table Mountain Sandstone]] (or, as it is currently known, the [[Cape Fold Belt#Table Mountain Group|Peninsula Formation Sandstone]]) above it. Looking up the slope from below to the first hairpin bend, the granite basement on which the Graafwater formation rests is visible. And in the cutting at the first hairpin bend, the ocher-colored, gritty clay into which the granite weathers is clearly displayed. The relatively thin Graafwater layer (no more than about 60–70&amp;nbsp;m thick on the Cape Peninsula) is overlain by the prominent [[Cape Fold Belt#Cape Supergroup|Peninsula Formation]], which consist mainly of hard, erosion resistant, quartzitic sandstone, which form the high, prominent, almost vertical cliffs of the Cape Peninsula. At the very top of [[Table Mountain]], at [[Thomas Maclear|Maclear's]] Beacon, is a small remnant of the ''Pakhuis [[Diamictite]]s'', better represented in the [[Cederberg Mountains]], 200&amp;nbsp;km to the north of Cape Town.&lt;ref name="sheet 3318" /&gt;

The '''Deputy Premier of Tasmania''' is a role in the [[Government of Tasmania]] assigned to a [[Individual ministerial responsibility|responsible]] Minister in the [[Australia]]n [[States and territories of Australia|state]] of [[Tasmania]]. It has second ranking behind the [[Premier of Tasmania]] in [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]], and its holder serves as Acting Premier during absence or incapacity of the Premier. The Deputy Premier may either be appointed by the Premier during the cabinet formation process, or may be elected by [[caucus]]. Due to the contingent role of the Deputy Premier, they almost without exception have additional ministerial portfolios. The current Deputy Premier is [[Jeremy Rockliff]].

'''Devín Carpathians''' ({{lang-sk|Devínske Karpaty}}, {{IPA-sk|ˈɟeʋiːnske ˈkarpati|pron}}) is a subdivision of the [[Little Carpathians]] [[mountain range]], located entirely within [[Bratislava]], the capital of [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.gov.sk/portal/sk/Default.aspx?CatID=104&amp;parent=10&lt;/ref&gt; It is bordered by the city boroughs of [[Devín]] from the west, [[Devínska Nová Ves]] from the north, [[Dúbravka, Bratislava|Dúbravka]] from the east and [[Karlova Ves]] from the south. Its highest mountain is [[Devínska Kobyla]] at 514 m (1,686 ft) [[Above mean sea level|AMSL]], it is also the highest point in Bratislava. The hills are mostly forested with [[deciduous]] trees and most of the area is protected by numerous nature reserves, including two geologically important areas: ''Sandberg'' containing [[sand]]s and [[sandstone]]s from the [[Cenozoic]] [[Paratethys]] ocean and ''Jezuitské Lesy'' containing rare granitic pegmatite bearing [[niobium]]-[[tantalum]] [[oxide]] [[mineral]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://paperfeed.org/node/858594&lt;/ref&gt;

Devín Carpathians are famous for its [[castle]]s, most notably the [[Bratislava Castle]] and the ruins of [[Devín Castle]]. The mountains feature numerous cultural monuments, caves, [[Czech Tramping|tramping]] huts, an open-air geology [[museum]] and a chemical waste dump. Military structures in the mountains include an abandoned rocket [[military base|base]] and preserved artillery fortifications from the time of [[Austria-Hungary]]. Featuring a dense network of forest trails, Devín Carpathians together with [[Bratislava Forest Park]] are frequented by citizens of the city and provide their main venue for hiking, mountain cycling, cross-country skiing and dog walking. 

== Location ==
The boundary of Devín Carpathians consists of the Slovak-Austrian border in the middle of the [[Morava (river)|Morava]] and [[Danube]] rivers from the west, the road connecting [[Devínska Nová Ves]] and [[Dúbravka, Bratislava|Dúbravka]] from the north, the road connecting Dúbravka with the crossing at [[Patrónka]] from the north-west and east, and [[Mlynská dolina]] from the south. The mountain range is located entirely within the administrative boundaries of Bratislava.

== Division ==
Devín Carpathians are divided into four [[geomorphological]] areas, separated by a series of [[Fault (geology)|faults]]:
* [[Bratislava Foothills]] ({{lang-sk|Bratislavské predhorie}})
* [[Devín Gate]] ({{lang-sk|Devínska brána}})

== Description ==
=== Geomorphology ===
Devín Carpathians consist of [[Paleozoic]] era landforms (south-eastern part), [[Mesozoic]] era landforms, [[Cenozoic]] era landforms, the latter including [[Quaternary]] period landforms.&lt;ref name=Speleo&gt;{{cite web|last=Lehotský|first=Roman|title=Kras Devínskych Karpát (Karst of Devín Carpathians)|url=http://www.speleobratislava.host.sk/Uzemie/dkuvod.htm|publisher=Speleo Bratislava|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are 5 caves in Devín Carpathians: Abrázna cave, J06041401 cave, J06041402 cave, Medzivrstvová cave (original name ''Zlepencová jaskyňa'') and Štokeravská vápenka cave (original name ''Stockerau''). Abrázna cave is a 10 meters long [[karst]] [[cave]]. Abrázna cave was created as a result of coastal modelling by a prehistoric Cenozoic sea and like all of the others, it is inaccessible to the public. It is supposedly the westernmost cave in [[Slovakia]], although actually it is rather the J06041401 cave. None of the caves are open to the public.

Notable rivers originating in the Devín Carpathians include Čierny potok and Mokrý jarok (also called ''Mokrý potok''), the latter is a short [[stream]] originating at the Devínska Kobyla mountain, draining its south-eastern part. It flows into the [[Danube]] near the quarry at Devínska cesta Street, near island [[Sihoť]].

=== Notable areas ===
[[image:Sandberg 12.jpg|thumb|right|Sandberg mountain]]

* Abandoned military rocket base ({{lang-sk|Rádiotechnická hláska protivzdušnej obrany štátu}}) located at the summit of Devínska Kobyla.
* Sandberg is a [[sandstone]] hill containing an important [[paleontological]] site, famous for its shark teeth, and bones of [[Seal (mammal)|seals]], [[whales]] and ancient [[monkeys]].
* ''[[Sorbus domestica]]'' of Devín is a protected tree, rare in Europe. This specimen is 80 years old and 10 meters tall. The tree is located in the [[vineyard]]s above Devín castle.
* Srdce ({{lang-en|Heart}}) is a former [[quarry]] named after its shape. It contains a chemical dump of artificial [[asphalt]] waste from the bombed Apollo refinery, created in 1963 by the [[Slovnaft]] rafinery in Bratislava.

=== Flora and fauna ===
[[image:Capreolus capreolus 2 (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|thumb|right|[[Capreolus capreolus|Roe deer]] is abundant in the Devín Carpathians]]

Flora and fauna is similar to that of the [[Little Carpathians]], yet the area of [[Devínska Kobyla]] represents the edge of the thermophilic dry vegetation of the pannonian plane. According to the phytogeorgraphical division of J. Futák (1964, 1972), Devínska Kobyla is grouped together with the neighboring [[Hundsheimer Berge]] in [[Austria]], consisting of an area of xerothermic pannonian flora (Eupannonicum).

Much of the area is densely forested with mostly [[pine]]-[[oak]] or [[oak]]-[[hornbeam]] trees. Humans have been shaping the environment in this area for centuries and anthropic changes included cutting and burning forests, creating meadows, establishing [[vineyard]]s and [[orchard]]s, grazing animals and planting new trees. Today, the area of Devín Carpathians contains a mixture of stony and grassy [[forest steppe]], shrublands and dense forests. Some areas are more often visited and continually being changed over the course of centuries, other areas are relatively intact. There are numerous [[endemism|endemic]] species living inside the protected areas. The mountains are rich in [[mushroom]] diversity as the small area of Devínska Kobyla alone contains at least 234 species of identified mushrooms.

Local flora contains approximately 1,100 species of [[plants]], 25 species are protected in Slovakia. The area is notable for its ''[[Viola (plant)|Viola]]'' hybrids. Dominant flora includes ''[[Stipa pulcherrima]]'', ''[[Carex humilis]]'', ''[[Scabiosa suaveolena]]'', ''[[Festuca valesiaca]]'', ''[[Ranunculus illyricus]]'' and ''[[Bromus erectus]]''. Protected plants include ''[[Adonis vernalis]]'', ''[[Pulsatilla nigricans]]'', ''[[Pulsatilla grandis]]'', ''[[Anemone sylvestris]]'', ''[[Lilium martagon]]'', ''[[Stipa joannis]]'', ''[[Jurinea mollis]]'', ''[[Iris pumila]]'', ''[[Dictamnus albus]]'', ''[[Cornus mas]]'', ''[[Prunus mahaleb]]'', ''[[Fraxinus ornus]]'', ''[[Chrysopogon gryllus]]'', ''[[Vinca herbacea]]'', ''[[Lathyrus pannonicus]]'', ''[[Platanthera bifolia]]'', ''[[Iris variegata]]'', ''[[Himantoglossum adriaticum]]'', ''[[Limodorum abortivum]]'' and ''[[Rhamnus saxatilis]]''. Other plants include ''[[Ononis pusilla]]'', ''[[Lathyrus sphaericus]]'', ''[[Conringia austriaca]]'', ''[[Potentilla pedata]]'', ''[[Smyrnium perfoliatum]]'', ''[[Bupleurum rotundifolium]]'', ''[[Consolida orientalis]]'' ssp. ''paniculata'' and ''[[Asplenium adiantum-nigrum]]''.

Fauna of Devín Carpathians is notable especially for its large number of species of heat-loving [[insects]]. Insects include 
''[[Coleophora dianthi]]'', ''[[Coleophora adspersella]]'', ''[[Coleophora virgatella]]'', ''[[Pandemis dumetanz]]'', ''[[Trachismia rigana]]'', ''[[Mantispa styriaca]]'', ''[[Zanclognatha tarsipennalis]]'', ''[[Yponomeuta vigintipunctatus]]'' and ''[[Procris gerryon]]''. Protected insects include ''[[Saga pedo]]'', ''[[Mantis religiosa]]'', ''[[Papilio machaon]]'', ''[[Iphiclides podalirius]]'', ''[[Ascalaphus macaronius]]'', ''[[Lucanus cervus]]'', ''[[Parnassius mnemosyne]]'' and others. [[Amphibian]]s include ''[[Salamandra salamandra]]'', ''[[Bufo bufo]]'' and ''[[Bufo viridis]]'', reptiles include ''[[Lacerta viridis]]'', ''[[Lacerta agilis]]'', ''[[Podarcis muralis]]'', ''[[Anguis fragilis]]'', ''[[Zamenis longissimus]]'', ''[[Natrix natrix]]'', ''[[Natrix tessellata]]'' and ''[[Coronella austriaca]]''. 

Birds known to hunt here include [[Monticola saxatilis|Common Rock Thrush]] and [[Falco cherrug|Saker Falcon]], birds known to nest here include [[Buteo buteo|Common Buzzard]]. Mammals include the numerous [[Capreolus capreolus|Roe deer]], also [[Dama dama|Fallow deer]], [[Cervus elaphus|Red deer]] only in the deep forest, [[Sus scrofa|Wild boar]], [[Vulpes vulpes|Red fox]] and [[Meles meles|European badger]]. There are no wolves or bears in the mountains.

=== Protected areas ===
Almost the entire area of the mountain range is protected by the [[Little Carpathians Protected Landscape Area]]. A small 650 [[hectare|ha]] patch of Devín Carpathians is protected under the [[European Union]] network of [[protected area]]s [[Natura 2000]]. Additionally, Slovak law protects the following areas inside the mountain range:
* National nature reserve [[Devínska Kobyla]] (''NPR Devínska Kobyla'')
* National nature monument Devín Castle rock (''NPP Devínska hradná skala'')
* National cultural monument [[Devín Castle]] (''NKP Devín - Slovanské hradisko'')
* National cultural monument Villa Rustica (''NKP Villa Rustica'')
* Natural monument Devín [[forest steppe]] (''PP Devínska lesostep'')
* Nature reserve Fialková valley (''PR Fialková dolina'')
* Nature reserve Štokeravská vápenka (''PR Štokeravská vápenka'')
* Nature reserve Slovanský island (''PR Slovanský ostrov'')
* Protected area Lesné diely (''CHA Lesné diely'')
* Protected tree [[Sorbus domestica]] of Devín (''CHS Devínska oskoruša'')

== Tourism ==
The main access point to Devín Carpathians is located at the parking lot underneath [[Devín Castle]]. The mountains feature the following hiking trails:
* Red trail TZT 0701a – from Devín, parking to [[Slavín]]. Length: 15.7 kilometers, [[cumulative elevation gain]] 625 meters.
* Yellow trail TZT 8104 – from Devín, parking to Dúbravka, House of Culture. Length: 6.6 kilometers, cumulative elevation gain 296 meters.
* Blue trail TZT 2461 – from Devín, parking to Devínska Nová Ves. Length: 4.9 kilometers, cumulative elevation gain 244 meters.
* Green trail TZT 5114 – from Devínska Nová Ves to Devínska Kobyla summit
* Blue trail TZT 2436 – from Karlova Ves, OD Centrum to Dúbravka, House of Culture
* Green trail TZT 5136 – from Dúbravka, House of Culture to Dúbravka, Technické sklo

There are 4 educational trails ({{lang-sk|náučný chodník}}) in the area of Devín Carpathians.&lt;ref name=Panorama.sk&gt;{{cite web|title=Devínske Karpaty - Náučné chodníky (Devín Carpathians - educational trails)|url=http://www.panorama.sk/sk/sprievodca/devinske-karpaty-naucne-chodniky/2184|publisher=Panorama.sk|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of them are administered by the city boroughs, which is why they are usually well-kept, unlike educational trails in other part of [[Little Carpathians]], especially those funded by a one-time money transfer from the [[European Union]] or the city of Bratislava. Educational trails in this area have not been damaged or destroyed by legal [[logging]] like in other areas (for example the Lamač – Železná studienka educational trail inside the [[Bratislavský lesný park]]).

* Dúbravka educational trail (Dúbravský náučný chodník) - from MiÚ Mestská časť Dúbravka to ZŠ Sokolíkova, length 4.5 km, cumulative elevation gain 149 m.
* Devínska Kobyla educational trail (Náučný chodník Devínska Kobyla) - from Devín Castle to Sandberg, length 4.0 km, cumulative elevation gain 280 m. It features 5 information signs: 1. Národná prírodná rezervácia Devínska Kobyla, 2. Rastlinstvo Devínskej Kobyly, 3. Historické premeny Devínskej Kobyly, 4. Živočíšstvo Devínskej Kobyly, 5. Geologická stavba Devínskej Kobyly a Sandberg.
* Slovak island educational trail (Náučný chodník Slovanský ostrov)- information signs from the original Slovak island educational trail were moved to Slovanské nábrežie.
* Dendropark - information signs were vandalized in the past, but are restored as of 2011.

The '''Doha Corniche''' is a waterfront [[Esplanade|promenade]] extending for seven kilometers along [[Doha Bay]] in the capital city of [[Doha]], the state of [[Qatar]].&lt;ref name="onlineqatar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineqatar.com/attractions/doha-corniche.aspx|title=Doha Corniche|publisher=Online Qatar|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annual celebrations of national holidays such as [[National Sports Day#Qatar|National Sports Day]]&lt;ref name="alagos"/&gt; and [[Qatar National Day]] are centered on the Doha Corniche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.gulf-times.com/story/575179/Qatar-all-set-for-National-Day-Doha-Corniche-all-d|title=Qatar all set for National Day; Doha Corniche all decked up|publisher=Gulf Times|author=Joseph Varghese|date=17 September 2017|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a popular tourist and leisure attraction within Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitqatar.qa/discover/tourist-hotspots/doha-corniche.html|title=Doha's Waterfront Promenade|publisher=Qatar Tourism Authority|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Doha 0428.jpg|thumb|The iconic [[Sheraton Doha Resort &amp; Convention Hotel|Sheraton Hotel]]]]
[[File:Doha Chorniche, Qatar - panoramio.jpg|thumb| General view of Corniche seafront]]
The Corniche used to be an empty stretch of walkway in which the only visible edifice was a [[Sheraton Hotel]], but development has increased in the 21st century with dozens of skyscrapers being built towards the north of the Corniche. The area's development is part of the economic boom the country has been experiencing and part of an effort to promote tourism, which was facilitated by the [[2006 Asian Games]].&lt;ref name="onlineqatar"/&gt;

Many of Doha's most iconic landmarks are found along the Corniche, beginning from around the [[Museum of Islamic Art (Doha)|Museum of Islamic Art]] and ending at the Sheraton Park near the distinctive pyramid-shaped [[Sheraton Doha Resort &amp; Convention Hotel|Sheraton Hotel]].&lt;ref name="onlineqatar"/&gt;

==Location and area==
The Corniche encircles [[Doha Bay]], running for a length of 7 kilometers. There are three main areas of the Corniche: the Corniche Park and Promenade, Corniche Street, and the Government zone.&lt;ref name="gharipour"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqDDCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA216|title=Contemporary Urban Landscapes of the Middle East|author=Mohammad Gharipour|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Corniche Promenade and Park are very popular destinations for walkers, runners, skaters, joggers and others engaging in leisure and social activities.&lt;ref name="onlineqatar" /&gt; 

Corniche Street is a paramount route which connects Doha's emerging [[West Bay (Doha)|West Bay]] business district with the south of the city and [[Doha International Airport]]. It was formed following extensive dredging work carried out during the late 1970s and early 1980s which reshaped Doha's coastline.&lt;ref name="onlineqatar" /&gt; 

As for the Government zone, which commands a view of the bay, administrative buildings such as the [[Amiri Diwan of the State of Qatar|Amiri Diwan]] are found here.&lt;ref name="gharipour"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16674">'''Earth section paths''' are paths on the earth defined by the intersection of a [[reference ellipsoid]] and a plane. Common examples of earth sections include the great ellipse and normal sections. This page provides a unifying approach to all earth sections and their associated [[geodesy|geodetic problems]].

== The Indirect Problem ==
The indirect problem for earth sections is: given two points, &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; on the surface of the reference ellipsoid, find the length, &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt;, of the short arc of a spheroid section from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; and also find the departure and arrival (true north referenced) [[azimuth]]s of that curve, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;P_k&lt;/math&gt; have geodetic latitude  &lt;math&gt;\phi_k&lt;/math&gt; and longitude &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k&lt;/math&gt; (k=1,2). This problem is best solved using [[analytic geometry]] in [[ECEF]] coordinates.
Let &lt;math&gt;R_1=ECEF(P_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2=ECEF(P_2)&lt;/math&gt; be the ECEF coordinates of the two points, computed using the geodetic to ECEF transformations discussed [[Geographic coordinate conversion|here]].

=== Section plane ===
To define the section plane select any third point &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; not on the line from &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;. Choosing &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; to be on the surface normal at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; will define the normal section at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; is the origin then the earth section is the great ellipse. (The origin would be co-linear with 2 antipodal points so a different point must be used in that case). Since there are infinitely many choices for &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt;, the above problem is really a class of problems (one for each plane). Let &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; be given. To put the equation of the plane into the standard form, &lt;math&gt;lx + my + nz = d&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\ l^2 + m^2 + n^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, requires the components of a [[unit vector]], &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}} = (l, m, n)&lt;/math&gt;, normal to the section plane. These components may be computed as follows: The vector from &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; has components &lt;math&gt;V_0=R_1 - R_0&lt;/math&gt;, and the vector from &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; has components &lt;math&gt;V_1=R_2 - R_1&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;unit(V_0&lt;/math&gt;×&lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;unit(V)&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector in the direction of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. The orientation convention used here is that &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; points to the left of the path. If this is not the case then redefine &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; = -&lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, the parameter d for the plane may be computed using the [[dot product]] of &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; with a vector from the origin to any point on the plane, such as &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. d = &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}\cdot{R_1}&lt;/math&gt;. The equation of the plane (in vector form) is thus &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; ⋅ &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = d, where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[position vector]] of (x, y, z).

A unit vector pointing up at any point on the ellipsoid is: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{u}}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;(\cos\phi\cos\lambda,\cos\phi\sin\lambda,\sin\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, a unit vector pointing north is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;(-\sin\phi\cos\lambda,-\sin\phi\sin\lambda,\cos\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, and east is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{e}}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;(-\sin\lambda,\cos\lambda,0)&lt;/math&gt;. A vector tangent to the path is:
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}= \hat{N} \times \mathbf{\hat{u}}&lt;/math&gt; so the east component of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{e}}&lt;/math&gt;, and the north component is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the azimuth may be obtained from a [[atan2|two-argument arctangent function]], &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{atan2}(\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{e}},\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}})&lt;/math&gt;. Use this method at both &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Section Ellipse ===
The (non-trivial) intersection of a plane and ellipsoid is an ellipse. Therefore, the arc length, &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt;, on the section path from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; is an [[elliptic integral]] that may be computed to any desired accuracy using a truncated series. Before this can be done the ellipse must be defined and the limits of integration computed.
Let the ellipsoid given by &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{a^2}+\frac{z^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt; p=\sqrt{l^2+m^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
If p=0 then the section is a horizontal circle of radius &lt;math&gt;a\sqrt{1-\frac{d^2}{b^2}}&lt;/math&gt;, which has no solution if &lt;math&gt;|d|&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

If p&gt;0 then Gilbertson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbertson|first1=Charles|title=Earth Section Paths|journal=Navigation|date=Spring 2012|volume=59|issue=1|pages=1-7|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/navi.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the ECEF coordinates of the center of the ellipse is &lt;math&gt;{R_c}=\frac{d}{C}(la^2, ma^2, nb^2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C=a^2p^2+b^2n^2&lt;/math&gt;,

the semi-major axis is &lt;math&gt;a^*=a\sqrt{1-\frac{d^2}{C}}&lt;/math&gt;, in the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}=(\frac{m}{p}, \frac{-l}{p}, 0)&lt;/math&gt;, and
the semi-minor axis is &lt;math&gt;b^*=\frac{b}{\sqrt{C}}a^*&lt;/math&gt;,  in the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}=(\frac{ln}{p}, \frac{mn}{p}, -p)&lt;/math&gt;, which has no solution if &lt;math&gt;|d|&gt;\sqrt{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Arc Length ===
The polar form relative to center for the equation of an ellipse is &lt;math&gt;R(\theta)= \frac{b^*}{\sqrt{1-e^2 \cos^2 \theta}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;e^2=1-\frac{(b^*)^2}{(a^*)^2}&lt;/math&gt;, relates to the ellipse eccentricity,  not the spheroid eccentricity (see [[ellipse]]). Let P be a point on the ellipse and &lt;math&gt;R=ECEF(P)&lt;/math&gt;, then the vector from &lt;math&gt;{R_c}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; has components &lt;math&gt;R-R_c&lt;/math&gt;. Using an argument similar to the one for azimuth above, let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{w}}=unit(R-R_c)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta=\mathbf{\hat{w}}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sin\theta=\mathbf{\hat{w}}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\theta =\operatorname{atan2}(\sin\theta,\cos\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. In this way we obtain the central angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta_{2}&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Care must be taken to ensure that 0 ≤ &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; ≤ &lt;math&gt; \theta_2&lt;/math&gt; ≤ &lt;math&gt;\theta_1  + \pi &lt;/math&gt;. Then the [[arc length]] along the ellipse is given by &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt; =&lt;math&gt;\int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \sqrt{R^2+(R^')^2}d\theta.&lt;/math&gt; Substituting &lt;math&gt;r(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; above into this formula, performing the indicated operations, using one more term than Gilbertson's expression and regrouping, results in 
&lt;math&gt;s_{12} = ArcLength(\theta_1,\theta_2) = b^*({c_0}\Delta\theta + {c_1}\Delta s2 + {c_2}\Delta s4 + {c_3}\Delta s6)&lt;/math&gt;, where
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Delta\theta&amp;=\theta_2-\theta_1,\\[6pt]
\Delta s2&amp;=\sin(2\theta_2)-\sin(2\theta_1),\\[6pt]
\Delta s4&amp;=\sin(4\theta_2)-\sin(4\theta_1),\\[6pt]
\Delta s6&amp;=\sin(6\theta_2)-\sin(6\theta_1),\\[6pt]
{c_0}&amp;=1+e^2(4096 + 3328e^2 + 2880e^4 + 2577e^6 + 16860e^8)/16384,\\[6pt]
{c_1}&amp;=e^2(512 + 384e^2 + 380e^4 + 385e^6 + 3408e^8)/4096,\\[6pt]
{c_2}&amp;=-e^4(64 + 80e^2 + 19e^4 - 3516e^6)/16384,\\[6pt]
{c_3}&amp;=-e^6(60 + 105e^2 - 528e^4)/12288.\\[6pt]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Alternatively, expansions for the [[Meridian arc]] may be used here by replacing the spheroid eccentricity with the section ellipse eccentricity.

== The Direct Problem ==
The direct problem is given &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;, the distance, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, and departure azimuth, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt;, find &lt;math&gt;{P_2}&lt;/math&gt; and the arrival azimuth, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;.
=== Section plane ===
Construct the tangent vector at &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{t_1}= \mathbf\hat{n_1}\cos{\alpha_1} + \mathbf{\hat{e_1}}\sin{\alpha_1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{n_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{e_1}}&lt;/math&gt; are unit vectors pointing north and east (respectively) at &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;. Pick a vector,  &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt;, to define the section plane, paying attention to orientation. Observe that &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; must not be in span{&lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{n_1} ,\mathbf{\hat{e_1}}&lt;/math&gt;} (otherwise the plane would be tangent to the earth at &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;, so no path would result). The normal vector &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;unit(V_0&lt;/math&gt;×&lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{t_1}&lt;/math&gt;),  together with &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt; defines the plane.
=== Locate &lt;math&gt;{P_2}&lt;/math&gt;===
This is a 2-d problem in span{&lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{i^*} , \mathbf\hat{j^*}&lt;/math&gt;},  which will be solved with the help of the arc length formula above. The basic approach is to use Newton-Raphson iteration to arrive at &lt;math&gt;{P_2}&lt;/math&gt;. The basis of the estimate is that the position vector of any point on the section ellipse may be expressed in terms of the position vector of the center and the central angle as 
&lt;math&gt;V={V_c} + {r(\theta)}(\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}\cos\theta+\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}\sin\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.
To get an initial estimate of &lt;math&gt;{\theta_2}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;{V_1}={R_1}-R{_c}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\theta_1}&lt;/math&gt;=Central_Angle&lt;math&gt;({V_1})&lt;/math&gt; (see the arc length section above),
&lt;math&gt;{r_1}=r({\theta_1})&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta\theta=\frac{\delta}{r_1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now initialize &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\theta_1 + \Delta\theta&lt;/math&gt;, and iterate the following steps:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s &amp;= ArcLength({\theta_1}, {\theta_2}),\\[6pt]
Err &amp;= \delta - s,\\[6pt]
s'({\theta}) &amp;= \frac{b^*}{(1-e^2 \cos^2 \theta)}\sqrt{\frac{(1-(2-e^2) e^2 \cos^2 \theta}{1-e^2 \cos^2 \theta}},\\[6pt]
\Delta\theta &amp;= \frac{Err}{s'({\theta_2})}, \\[6pt]
\theta_2 &amp;= \theta_2 + \Delta\theta, \\[6pt]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
exit when &lt;math&gt;abs(\Delta\theta) &lt; 10^{-12}&lt;/math&gt;

No more than three iterations are usually necessary, although nearly antipodal cases can be problematic.
Finally, let &lt;math&gt;{V_2}={V_c} + {r(\theta_2)}(\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}\cos\theta_2+\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}\sin\theta_2)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;{P_2}&lt;/math&gt; = ECEF_to_Geo&lt;math&gt;({V_2})&lt;/math&gt; using Bowring’s 1985 algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowring|first1=B.R.|title=The accuracy of geodetic latitude and height equations|journal=Survey Review|date=1985|volume=28|issue=218|pages=202-206}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the algorithm [[Geographic coordinate conversion|here]].

Alternatively, inversion of the arc length series may be used to avoid iterations.

=== Azimuth ===
Azimuth may be obtained by the same method as the indirect problem: &lt;math&gt;{\alpha_2}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{atan2}(\mathbf{t_2}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{e_2}},\mathbf{t_2}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n_2}})&lt;/math&gt;, where the subscript 2 indicates evaluation of the associated quantity at &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
=== The great ellipse ===
Let &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; be the origin, so that &lt;math&gt;{V_0}&lt;/math&gt; = the position vector of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;. The above approach provides an alternative to that of others, such as Bowring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowring|first1=B.R.|title=The Direct and Inverse Solutions for the Great Elliptic Line on the Reference Ellipsoid|journal=Bulletin Geodesique|date=1984|volume=58|issue=1|pages=101-108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normal sections ===
The normal section at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is determined by letting &lt;math&gt;{V_0}&lt;/math&gt; =  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{u_1}&lt;/math&gt; (the surface normal at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;). The above approach provides an alternative to that of others, such as Bowring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowring|first1=B.R.|title=The normal section -- forward and inverse formulae at any distance|journal=Survey Review|date=1971|volume=XXI|issue=161|pages=131-136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The mean normal section ===
The mean normal section from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; is determined by letting &lt;math&gt;{V_0}&lt;/math&gt; =  &lt;math&gt;0.5(\mathbf\hat{u_1}+\mathbf\hat{u_2})&lt;/math&gt;. This is a good approximation to the geodesic from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; for aviation or sailing.

=== A class of sections ===
A class of sections may be imagined by rotating &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{u_1}&lt;/math&gt; about the chord connecting &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2.&lt;/math&gt; All of these may be solved with the single approach above.

== Intersections ==
Let two section planes be given: &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;⋅&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;⋅&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming that the two planes are not parallel, the line of intersection is on both planes. Hence orthogonal to both normals, i.e. in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3} = \hat{N_1} \times \hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt; are not colinear &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt; is a basis for &lt;math&gt;R^3&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, there exist constants &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; such that the line of intersection of the 2 planes is given by &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C_1\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt;, where t is an independent parameter.

Since this line is on both section planes, it satisfies both: 
&lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;) = &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt;, and 
&lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;) + &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Solving these equations for &lt;math&gt;{C_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{C_2}&lt;/math&gt; gives 
&lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; [1 - (&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}\hat{N_2})^2&lt;/math&gt; ] = &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; - &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;), and 
&lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; [1 - (&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}\hat{N_2})^2&lt;/math&gt; ] = &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt; - &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;).

Define the “dihedral angle”, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, by &lt;math&gt;\cos\alpha&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N_1}}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;{\hat{N_2}}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{(d_1- d_2  \cos\alpha)}{\sin^2\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; ,  and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{(d_2- d_1 \cos\alpha)}{\sin^2 \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.

On the intersection line we have &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt;,  where &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C_1\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence: &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;l_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;m_3&lt;/math&gt;,  and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;n_3&lt;/math&gt;, where
&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;= &lt;math&gt;C_1l_1&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2l_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C_1m_1&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2m_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C_1n_1&lt;/math&gt; +&lt;math&gt;C_2n_2&lt;/math&gt;.
and &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_i}&lt;/math&gt;=(&lt;math&gt;l_i&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;), for i=1,2,3.

To find the intersection of this line with the earth, plug the line equations into &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{a^2}+\frac{z^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, to get
&lt;math&gt;At^2 + 2Bt + C = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;l_3^2 + m_3^2 + \frac{a^2}{b^2}n_3^2&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;x_0l_3 + y_0m_3 + \frac{a^2}{b^2}z_0n_3&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;x_0^2 + y_0^2 + \frac{a^2}{b^2}z_0^2 - a^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, the line intersects the earth at &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{{B}^2-AC}}{A}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;B^2 &lt; AC&lt;/math&gt;, then there is no intersection. If &lt;math&gt;B^2 = AC&lt;/math&gt;, then the line is tangent to the earth at &lt;math&gt;t = -B/A&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the sections intersect at that single point).

Observe that &lt;math&gt;A\ne0&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;are not colinear.  Plugging t into
&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt;, gives the points of intersection of the earth sections.

=== Examples ===
==== Maximum or Minimum Latitude ====
on a earth section path may be found by dropping the subscripts on the given section; &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1} = (l, m, n)&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;d_1 = d&lt;/math&gt;, and setting &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2} = (0, 0, 1)&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3} = (m, -l, 0)&lt;/math&gt;. Then solve for &lt;math&gt;d_2 = z_2&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;B^2 = AC&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;B = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, we must have &lt;math&gt;C = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Plugging t into &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;R_0 + t\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt;, gives the points of intersection of the earth sections. Alternatively, just set &lt;math&gt;R = {R_c} \pm b^*\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Maximum or Minimum Longitude ====
on a earth section path may be found by dropping the subscripts on the given section; &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1} = (l, m, n)&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;d_1 = d&lt;/math&gt;, and setting &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2} = (-\sin\theta, \cos\theta, 0)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the longitude to be solved for such that &lt;math&gt;B^2 = AC&lt;/math&gt;.

Alternatively, just set &lt;math&gt;R = {R_c} \pm a^*\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Frederick Albert Cook''' (June 10, 1865&amp;nbsp;– August 5, 1940) was an American explorer, physician, and [[ethnographer]], noted for his claim of having reached the [[North Pole]] on April 21, 1908. This was nearly a year before [[Robert Peary]], who reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909. Both men's accounts were disputed for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 2009, pp. 58–69.&lt;/ref&gt; His expedition did discover [[Meighen Island]], the only discovery of an island in the [[North American Arctic|American Arctic]] by a United States expedition.

In December 1909, after reviewing Cook's limited records, a commission of the [[University of Copenhagen]] ruled his claim unproven. In 1911, Cook published a memoir of his expedition, continuing his claim. His account of reaching [[Denali|Mount McKinley]]'s summit has also been discredited.

== Biography ==
Cook's birthplace is often listed as [[Callicoon, New York]], but he was actually born in [[Hortonville, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryce 1997, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were recent German immigrants who anglicized their name by adopting the phonetic version of their surname. He attended [[Columbia University]] and received his doctorate from [[New York University Medical School]] in 1890. Cook married Libby Forbes in 1889. She died two years later. In 1902, on his 37th birthday, he married Marie Fidele Hunt. They had two daughters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/frederick-albert-cook-explorer-and-physician-usa-his-news-photo/501373901|title=Ruth and Helene Cook|work=Haeckel Collection|publisher=Getty Images|accessdate=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and divorced in 1923.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Early expeditions ===
Cook was the surgeon on [[Robert Peary]]'s Arctic expedition of 1891–1892, and on the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] of 1897–1899. He contributed to saving the lives of its crew members when their ship—the {{RV|Belgica|1884|2}}—was ice-bound during the winter, as they had not prepared for such an event. It became the first expedition to winter in the Antarctic region. To prevent [[scurvy]], Cook went hunting to keep the crew supplied with fresh meat.

In 1897, Cook twice visited [[Tierra del Fuego]], where he met Anglican missionary [[Thomas Bridges (Anglican missionary)|Thomas Bridges]]. They studied the [[Ona people|Ona]] and [[Yahgan]], with whom Bridges had worked for two decades, during which time he had prepared a manuscript on their language's grammar and a dictionary of more than 30,000 words. Cook borrowed the manuscript for reference but failed to return it before Bridges' death in 1898. Several years later, he tried to publish the dictionary as his own.&lt;ref name="parson"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/05/21/104935739.pdf "Cook Tried to Steal Parson's Life Work"]. ''New York Times'', May 21, 1910. Accessed October 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mount McKinley summit ===
[[File:Fakepeak.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Alleged photo of McKinley's summit, now known as [[Fake Peak]]]]
In 1903, he led an expedition to [[Mount McKinley]] during which he circumnavigated the Denali range. He made a second journey in 1906, after which he claimed to have achieved the first summit of its peak with one other expedition crew member. Other members, including Belmore Browne, whom Cook had left on the lower mountain, immediately but privately expressed doubt. Cook's claims were not publicly challenged until 1909 when the dispute with Peary over the North Pole claim erupted, with Peary's supporters claiming Cook's McKinley ascent was also fraudulent.

Contrary to [[Hudson Stuck]] in 1913, Cook had not taken photographs from atop McKinley. His alleged photo of the summit was found to have been taken on [[Fake Peak|a small outcrop on a ridge beside the Ruth Glacier]], 19 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf "An aerial photograph by Bradford Washburn"]. ''DIO''. '''7''' (2). p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1909, [[Ed Barrill]], Cook's sole companion during the 1906 climb, signed an affidavit denying that they had reached the summit. In the late 20th century, historians found that he was paid by Peary supporters to do so. (Henderson writes that this fact was covered up at the time, but Bryce says that it was never a secret.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/vols/w93.pdf ''DIO'']. '''9''' (3). p. 129. note 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Up until a month before, Barrill had consistently asserted that he and Cook had reached the summit. His 1909 affidavit included a map correctly locating what became called [[Fake Peak]], featured in Cook's "summit" photo, and showing that he and Cook had turned back at the Gateway.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf ''DIO'']. '''7''' (2). p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Climber [[Bradford Washburn]] has gathered data, repeated the climbs, and taken new photos to evaluate Cook's 1906 claim. Between 1956 and 1995, Washburn and Brian Okonek identified the locations of most of the photographs Cook took during his 1906 Denali foray and took new photos at the same spots. In 1997 Bryce identified the locations of the remaining photographs, including Cook's "summit" photograph;&lt;ref&gt;Compare rock-by-rock the left side of Cook's 1906 "summit" photo to the corresponding parts of the 1957 photo by Adams Carter and Bradford Washburn. Photos juxtaposed in Bryce, R. (1999). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w93.pdf ''DIO'']. '''9''' (3). p. 116. Compare also the background features in Cook's "summit" photo versus those in his own photo taken a few minutes later (towards the same direction) from the top of Fake Peak: Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf ''DIO'']. '''7''' (2). figure 4 versus figure 18; detailed-blowup comparisons in figures 6 and 8.&lt;/ref&gt; none were taken anywhere near the summit. Washburn showed that none of Cook's 1906 photos were taken past the "Gateway" (north end of the Great Gorge), 12 horizontal bee-line miles from Denali and 3 miles below its top.

An expedition by the Mazama Club in 1910 reported that Cook's map departed abruptly from the landscape at a point when the summit was still 10 miles distant. Critics of Cook's claims have compared Cook's map of his alleged 1906 route with the landscape of the last 10 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf ''DIO'']. '''7''' (3). pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Cook's descriptions of the summit ridge are variously claimed to bear no resemblance to the mountain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Dishonorable Dr. Cook: Debunking the Notorious Mount McKinley Hoax | first = Bradford | last = Washburn | authorlink = Bradford Washburn |author2=Peter Cherici | year = 2001 | location = Seattle | publisher = Mountaineers Books | oclc = 47054650}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to have been verified by many subsequent climbers.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson (2005) p.282&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1970s, climber [[Hans Waale]] found a route which fit Cook's narrative and descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf Bryce (1997) ''DIO''] p.73&lt;/ref&gt; Three decades later, in 2005 and 2006, this route was successfully climbed by a group of Russian mountaineers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shparo.com/Cook/Cook_main.htm "Following the traces of Dr. Frederick Cook"], SH Paro&lt;/ref&gt;

No evidence of Cook's purported journey between the "Gateway" and the summit has been found. His claim to have reached the summit is not supported by his photos' vistas, his two sketch maps' markers, and peak-numberings for points attained,&lt;ref&gt;Bryce. (1997). ''DIO'' pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; nor by his compass bearings, barometer readings, route-map or camp trash. However, samples of all such evidence have been found short of the Gateway.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, R. (1999). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w93.pdf ''DIO'']. '''9''' (3). pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Pole ===
[[File:Frederick Cook's 1909 arctic expedition.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Photo allegedly taken at, or near, the North Pole]]
After the Mount Denali expedition, Cook returned to the [[Arctic]] in 1907. He planned to attempt to reach the [[North Pole]], although he did not announce his intention until August 1907, when he was already in the Arctic. He left [[Annoatok]], a small settlement in the north of [[Greenland]], in February 1908. Cook claimed that he reached the pole on April 22, 1908, after traveling north from [[Axel Heiberg Island]], taking with him only two Inuit men, Ahpellah and Etukishook. On the journey south, he claimed to have been cut off from his intended route to Annoatok by open water. Living off local game, his party was forced to push south to [[Jones Sound]], spending the open water season and part of the winter on [[Devon Island]]. From there they traveled north, eventually crossing [[Nares Strait]] to Annoatok on the Greenland side in the spring of 1909. They said they almost died of starvation during the journey.

Cook and his two companions were gone from Annoatok for 14 months, and their whereabouts in that period is a matter of intense controversy. In the view of Canadian historian [[Pierre Berton]] (Berton, 2001), Cook's story of his trek around the Arctic islands is probably legitimate. Other writers have relied on later accounts told by Cook's companions to investigators, who seemed to present another view.

There are striking similarities between Ahpellah and Etukishook's sketched route of their journey south, and the route taken by the fictional shipwrecked explorers in [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[The Adventures of Captain Hatteras]]''. For example, the route the two Inuit traced on a map goes over both the Pole of Cold and the wintering site of the fictional expedition. Both expeditions went to the same area of [[Jones Sound]] in hopes of finding a whaling ship to take them to civilization. For details, see Osczevski (2003).

Cook's claim was initially widely believed, but it was disputed by Cook's rival polar explorer [[Robert Peary]], who claimed to have reached the North Pole in April 1909. Cook initially congratulated Peary for his achievement, but Peary and his supporters launched a campaign to discredit Cook. They enlisted the aid of socially prominent persons outside the field of science, such as [[American football|football]] [[Coach (sport)|coach]] [[Fielding H. Yost]] (as related in [[Fred Russell]]'s 1943 book, ''I'll Go Quietly'').

[[File:Picture of Frederick Cook.jpg|thumb|Cook in arctic gear]]
Cook never produced detailed original navigational records to substantiate his claim to have reached the North Pole. He said that his detailed records were part of his belongings, contained in three boxes, which he left at Annoatok in April 1909. He had left them with [[Harry Whitney]], an American hunter who had traveled to Greenland with Peary the previous year due to the lack of manpower for a second sledge-journey 700 miles south to [[Upernavik]]. When Whitney tried to bring Cook's boxes with him on his return to the USA on Peary's ship ''Roosevelt'' in 1909, Peary refused to allow them on board. As a result, Whitney left Cook's boxes in a cache in Greenland. They were never found.

On December 21, 1909, a commission at the [[University of Copenhagen]], after having examined evidence submitted by Cook, ruled that his records did not contain proof that the explorer reached the Pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/12/22/101752152.pdf | title=University Finds That Cook's Papers Contain no Proof That He Reached the North Pole | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 22, 1909 | format=PDF | accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Peary refused to submit his records for review by such a third party, and for decades the [[National Geographic Society]], which held his papers, refused researchers access to them.)

Cook intermittently claimed he had kept copies of his sextant navigational data, and in 1911 published some.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, F. (1911). ''My Attainment of the Pole''. pp. 258, 274. Cook's first account of what he left with Whitney did not mention data, and Whitney knew of no data in what was left with him. See Rawlins, 1973, pp. 87, 166, 301–302.&lt;/ref&gt; These have an incorrect solar diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlins (1972). ''[[Norwegian Journal of Geography]]''. Oslo University. '''26'''. pp. 135–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahwelah and Etukishook, Cook's Inuit companions, gave seemingly conflicting details about where they had gone with him. The major conflicts have been resolved in the light of improved geographical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Osczevski, R. J. (2003). ''Arctic''. '''56''' (4).&lt;/ref&gt; Whitney was convinced that they had reached the North Pole with Cook, but was reluctant to be drawn into the controversy.

The Peary expedition's people (primarily [[Matthew Henson]], who had a working knowledge of Inuit, and George Borup, who did not) claimed that Ahwelah and Etukishook told them they had only traveled a few days from land. A map allegedly was drawn by Ahwelaw and Etukishook correctly located and accurately depicted then-unknown [[Meighen Island]], which strongly suggests that they visited it as they claimed.&lt;ref&gt;Osczevski, R. J. (2003). "Frederick Cook and the Forgotten Pole". ''Arctic''. '''56''' (2). pp. 207–217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rawlins, 1973, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A genuine Cook discovery, Meighen Island, is the only island discovered by a United States expedition in the American arctic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#mvmn Discoveries: "Meighen Island"], DIOI&lt;/ref&gt; For more detail see Bryce (1997) and Henderson (2005).

The conflicting claims of Cook and Peary prompted [[Roald Amundsen]] to take extensive precautions in navigation during his [[South Pole]] expedition so there could be no doubt concerning attainment of the pole if successful. Amundsen also had the advantage of traveling over a continent. He left unmistakable evidence of his presence at the South Pole, whereas any ice on which Cook might or might not have camped would have drifted many miles in the year between the competing claims.

At the end of his 1911 memoir, Cook wrote: "I have stated my case, presented my proofs. As to the relative merits of my claim, and Mr. Peary's, place the two records side by side. Compare them. I shall be satisfied with your decision."

== Reputation ==
Cook's reputation never recovered. While Peary's North Pole claim was widely accepted for most of the 20th century, it has been discredited by a variety of reviewers, including the National Geographic Society, which long supported him. Cook spent the next few years defending his claim and threatening to sue writers who said that he had faked the trip. Researching the complicated story of the conflicting claims, the writer Robert Bryce began to see how the men's personalities and goals were in contrast, and set them against the period of the [[Gilded Age]].&lt;ref name="ringle"/&gt; He believes that Cook, as a physician and ethnographer, cared about the people on his expedition and admired the Inuit. Bryce writes that Cook "genuinely loved and hungered for the real meat of exploration-mapping new routes and shorelines, learning and adapting to the survival techniques of the Eskimos, advancing his own knowledge-and that of the world-for its own sake."&lt;ref name="ringle"&gt;[http://www.surveyhistory.org/the_polar_controversy_resolved1.htm Ken Ringle, review: "''Cook &amp; Peary - The Polar Controversy Resolved''"], ''Backsights'', 1997, published by Surveyors Historical Society, accessed 3 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, he could not find supporters to help finance the expeditions without a goal that was more flashy. There was tremendous pressure on each man to be the first to reach the Pole, in order to gain support for continued expeditions.

=== Fraud trial ===
In 1919, Cook started promoting startup oil companies in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. In April 1923, Cook and 24 other Fort Worth oil promoters were indicted in a federal crackdown on fraudulent oil company promotions. Three of Cook's employees pleaded guilty, but Cook insisted on his innocence and was put on trial. Joining him in the trial was his head advertising copywriter, S. E. J. Cox, who had been previously convicted of mail fraud in connection with his own oil company promotions.

Among other deceptive practices, Cook was charged with paying dividends from stock sales, rather than from profits. Cook's attorney was former politician [[Joseph Weldon Bailey]], who clashed frequently with the judge. The jury found Cook guilty on 14 counts of fraud, and, in November 1923, Judge Killits sentenced Cook and 13 other oil company promoters to prison terms. Cook drew the longest sentence, 14 years 9 months. His attorney appealed the verdict, but the conviction was upheld.&lt;ref&gt;Olien, R. (1989). "Doctor Frederick A. Cook and the Petroleum Producers' Association". ''Journal of the West''. '''28''' (4). pp. 33–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
Cook was imprisoned until 1930. [[Roald Amundsen]], who believed he owed his life to Cook's extrication of the ''Belgica'', visited him several times.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Cook was [[pardon]]ed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1940, ten years after his release and shortly before his death of a cerebral hemorrhage on August 5. He was interred at the Chapel of [[Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo]].

The '''geographical centre of Ireland''' is in the townland of Carnagh East ({{Lang-ga|An Charnach Thoir}}), [[County Roscommon]] on the western shore of [[Lough Ree]], where the 8° Meridian West meets the 53°30' North Latitude. It is opposite the Cribby Islands and 8.85 kilometres NNW of [[Athlone]] Town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osi.ie/en/faq/faq3.aspx Irish Ordnance Survey faq] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228155031/http://www.osi.ie/en/faq/faq3.aspx |date=February 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lecarrow]] is the closest population centre.

In [[Irish mythology]], The [[Hill of Uisneach]] (which is on the road from [[Mullingar]] to [[Athlone]], about 17.7 kilometres west of Mullingar and two kilometres from the village of Loughanavally) was generally considered to be the ceremonial centre of [[Ireland]], though at times the [[Hill of Tara]] was also regarded in a similar manner. Up to 2007, a fire was lit every [[May Day]] and a Mass was celebrated on the hill of Uisneach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realirishfood-recipes.com/ireland-facts-geography.html Geography of Ireland; facts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geologic History, Stratigraphy &amp; Tectonics==
Some international dating work around 1973 indicated that most basement rock in North Korea dates to the Proterozoic or the earlier [[Archean]]. The North Kyangsong Province gneiss samples indicated ages to 2.12 billion years ago and in 1985, the Sangni Metamorphic Supergroup and the Sangni Revolution were proposed as names for the gneiss-schist and gneiss formation. These groupings have been used to make sense of the 2.1 billion year old Punchon Granitic Gneiss, the Wonnan Group and the P'yonghae Group.

The Machyollong Metamorphic Supergroup is particularly widespread in the northeast, overlying older basement rock near the Yalu River. The supergroup is up to 10 kilometers thick with magnesite-bearing marble, mica schist and quartzite (quartzite units increase in thickness to the west). The western edge of the Machyollong Zone is known as the Iwon Mobile Belt and contains extrusive and intrusive igneous rocks. 

The late [[Proterozoic]] Sangwon Synthem is widespread in the Pyongnam Basin and other, smaller basins in North Korea and experienced deformation during orogenies in the Mesozoic. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=466}}

The [[Late Ordovician]] Miru Series was identified beginning in 1971 as the Koksan Series and subsequently renamed after 1975. The 170 meter thick limestone and siltstone centered around the P'yongnam Basin has extensive [[crinoid]], coral and gastropod fossils. Paleogeography researchers have suggested that corals formed in the Miru Sea—a branch of the South Yangtze Sea. The discovery of [[Ordovician]] fossils meant that the previous Koksan Series was revised to be younger, encompassing [[Silurian]] [[slate]], limestone and siltstone in the Singye-Koksan area up to 280 meters thick. It includes [[trilobite]] and [[Rugosa]] fossils. 

For years, geologists in the Korean Peninsula were puzzled about the early [[Paleozoic]] fossils found in the early [[Mesozoic]] Taedong Synthem (limestone pebbles in the Kyomipo Conglomerate). However, in 1991, Kang and Pak inferred an origin from the Koksan Series. 
Marine fossils are also widespread in the Imjin Group, first recognized in 1962 in the Kaesong-Kumchon-Cholwon area. The three kilometer thick unit is subdivided into the Anhyop, Puapsan and Saknyong Series and is widespread throughout the Imjinang Fold Belt in central North Korea. The Anhyop Series represents one kilometer of  schist, limestone, [[phyllite]] and sandstone. The 1.1 kilometer Puapsan Series and one kilometer Saknyong Series are both very similar, although the Saknyong also has siltstone and volcanic rocks. North Korean geologists have identified the Imjin Group as a continental rift basin, correlated with similar rocks on the Shandong Peninsula across the Yellow Sea in China. Many of the rocks have experienced low-grade metamorphism and volcanic sequences are comparatively thick. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=467}}

At the base of the Taedong Synthem is the P'yong'an Supergroup, which lies disconformably atop older Paleozoic rocks. In the Pyongyang Coalfield it is divided into the 650 meter sandstone, shale and conglomerate of the Nogam Formation, the 500 meter Kobangsan Formation, 350 meter coal-bearing Sadong Formation and 250 meter chert-bearing Hongjom Formation, all typically assigned to an Upper Permian shallow marine environment. 

===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
During the Mesozoic, the region experienced the Songnim Orogeny, named for overturned, overthrusted Choson and P'yong'an synthem rocks near Songnim, north of Pyongyang. This event is associated with the 240 to 190 million year old Triassic and Jurassic Hyesan Complex pluton. 

Taebo, a place north of Pyongyang is the namesake of the Taebo orogeny, a period of tectonic activity that emplaced the Taebo Granite around 180 million years ago. The orogeny, which is evidenced in the Okchon Supergroup, is likely related to the separation of Japan from Asia. 

North of Pyongyang, Precambrian basement rocks are unconformably overlain by a [[Jurassic]] limestone conglomerate ascending to layers of siltstone and mudstone. The Upper Jurassic Shinuiju Formation northwest of Shinuiju has sandstone, conglomerate and mudstone up to two kilometers thick. Offshore drilling in the West Korea Bay Basin indicates these rocks are the onshore extension of offshore units. It is subdivided into fluvial rocks and Upper Jurassic black shale, limestone, conglomerate and sandstone formed in a lake environment. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=470}}

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
Longstanding terrestrial conditions prevailed through much of the [[Cenozoic]], until the recent geological past, when the a marine regression flooded the area around the peninsula. Very few Cenozoic sediments are known from either Korea, likely as a result of erosion due to uplift of the peninsula. Submarine normal faults along the eastern coastline may have driven crustal tilting. 
The 350 meter thick Bongsan Coalfield in Hwanghae Province on the west coast preserves and coal-bearing layers dating to the [[Eocene]]. Further to the north, in the West Korea Bay Basin Eocene and [[Oligocene]] sedimentary rocks up to three kilometers thick unconformably overlie Mesozoic rocks, formed in lakes and coal swamps during the [[Paleogene]].

The '''geology of the Appalachians''' dates back to more than 480 million years ago. A look at rocks exposed in today's [[Appalachian Mountains]] reveals elongate belts of [[fold (geology)|fold]]ed and [[thrust fault]]ed marine [[sedimentary rock]]s, [[volcanic rock]]s and slivers of [[ophiolite|ancient ocean floor]] - strong evidence that these rocks were deformed during [[plate tectonics|plate collision]]. The birth of the Appalachian ranges marks the first of several [[mountain building]] plate collisions that culminated in the construction of the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] with the Appalachians and neighboring [[Little Atlas]] (now in Morocco) near the center.  These mountain ranges likely once reached elevations similar to those of the [[Alps]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]] before they were eroded.&lt;ref name="aaas"&gt;{{cite web |work=Science magazine |publisher=AAAS |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2009/11/03-02.html?etoc |title=The Mountains That Froze the World |accessdate=2012-04-04 |first=Phil |last=Berardelli |date=2009-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AXV1niny?url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2009/11/03-02.html?etoc |archivedate=2012-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usgs2"&gt;{{citeweb|publisher=USGS |url=http://geology.er.usgs.gov/eespteam/Mtleconte/website/geology.html?etoc |title=Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains |accessdate=2012-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117093921/http://geology.er.usgs.gov/eespteam/Mtleconte/website/geology.html?etoc |archivedate=2013-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geological history==

===Paleozoic Era===
[[Image:Eastern North American Paleogeograpy Middle Devonian.png|thumb|right|[[Palaeogeography|Paleogeographic]] reconstruction showing the Appalachian Basin area during the [[Middle Devonian]] period.&lt;ref name="url"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/rcb7/nam.html |title=Paleogeography and Geologic Evolution of North America |first=Ron |last=Blakey |publisher=Northern Arizona University |work=Global Plate Tectonics and Paleogeography |accessdate=2008-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621201253/http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/rcb7/nam.html# |archive-date=2008-06-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During the earliest [[Paleozoic]] Era, the continent that would later become [[North America]] straddled the [[equator]]. The Appalachian region was a [[passive plate margin]], not unlike today's [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]] Province. During this interval, the region was periodically submerged beneath shallow seas. Thick layers of sediment and [[carbonate rock]] were deposited on the shallow sea bottom when the region was submerged. When seas receded, terrestrial sedimentary deposits and erosion dominated.&lt;ref name="usgs"&gt;{{USGS|url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/province/appalach.html|article=Geologic Provinces of the United States: Appalachian Highlands Province|accessdate=2007-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the middle [[Ordovician]] Period (about 440-480 million years ago), a change in plate motions set the stage for the first Paleozoic mountain building event ([[Taconic orogeny]]) in North America. The once quiet Appalachian passive margin changed to a very active [[plate boundary]] when a neighboring [[oceanic plate]], the [[Iapetus Ocean|Iapetus]], collided with and began sinking beneath the North American [[craton]]. With the creation of this new [[subduction zone]], the early Appalachians were born.&lt;ref name="usgs"/&gt;

Along the [[continental margin]], [[volcano]]es grew, coincident with the initiation of subduction. Thrust faulting uplifted and warped older sedimentary rock laid down on the passive margin. As mountains rose, [[erosion]] began to wear them down. Streams carried rock debris downslope to be deposited in nearby [[lowland]]s.&lt;ref name="usgs"/&gt;

This was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the Appalachians. Mountain building continued periodically throughout the next 250 million years ([[Caledonian orogeny|Caledonian]], [[Acadian orogeny|Acadian]], [[Ouachita orogeny|Ouachita]], [[Hercynian orogeny|Hercynian]], and [[Alleghenian orogeny|Alleghenian]] orogenies). Continent after continent was thrust and sutured onto the North American craton as the Pangean supercontinent began to take shape. [[Terrane|Microplates]], smaller bits of crust, too small to be called continents, were swept in, one by one, to be welded to the growing mass.&lt;ref name="usgs"/&gt;

By about 300 million years ago ([[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] Period) [[Africa]] was approaching the North American craton. The collisional belt spread into the [[Ozark Mountains|Ozark]]-[[Ouachita Mountains|Ouachita]] region and through the [[Marathon Uplift|Marathon Mountains]] area of Texas. Continent vs. continent collision raised the Appalachian-Ouachita chain to a lofty mountain range on the scale of the present-day [[Himalaya]]. The massive bulk of Pangea was completed near the end of the Paleozoic Era ([[Permian]] Period) when Africa ([[Gondwana]]) plowed into the continental agglomeration, with the Appalachian-Ouachita mountains near the core.&lt;ref name="usgs"/&gt;

=== Mesozoic Era and later ===
Pangea began to break up about 220 million years ago, in the Early [[Mesozoic]] Era (Late [[Triassic]] Period). As Pangea rifted apart a new passive tectonic margin was born and the forces that created the Appalachian, Ouachita, and Marathon Mountains were stilled. Weathering and erosion prevailed, and the mountains began to wear away.&lt;ref name="usgs"/&gt;

By the end of the [[Mesozoic]] Era, the Appalachian Mountains had been eroded to an almost flat plain.&lt;ref name="usgs"/&gt; It was not until the region was [[tectonic uplift#Isostatic uplift|uplifted]] during the [[Cenozoic]] Era that the distinctive topography of the present formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=C. Wylie|last1=Poag|first2=William D.|last2=Sevon|title=A record of Appalachian denudation in postrift Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary deposits of the U.S. Middle Atlantic continental margin|journal=Geomorphology|volume=2|issue=1–3|date=September 1989|pages=119–157|doi=10.1016/0169-555X(89)90009-3|bibcode = 1989Geomo...2..119P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Uplift [[rejuvenation (river)|rejuvenated]] the streams, which rapidly responded by cutting downward into the ancient bedrock. Some streams flowed along weak layers that define the folds and faults created many millions of years earlier. Other streams [[downcutting|downcut]] so rapidly that they cut right across the resistant folded rocks of the mountain core, carving canyons across rock layers and geologic structures.&lt;ref name="usgs"/&gt; The ridges of the Appalachian Mountain core represent erosion-resistant rock that remained after the rock above and beside it was eroded away.&lt;ref name="usgs"/&gt;

==Geologic provinces==
[[File:Appalachian map.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Map of Appalachian geological provinces]]
The Appalachian Mountains span across five geologic provinces (as defined by the [[USGS]]): the Appalachian Basin,&lt;ref name=appBasin/&gt; the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Piedmont Province, the Adirondack Province, and the New England Province.&lt;ref name=otherProv/&gt;

=== The Appalachian Basin ===
The Appalachian Basin is a [[foreland basin]] containing [[Paleozoic]] [[sedimentary rock]]s of [[Early Cambrian]] through [[Early Permian]] age. From north to south, the Appalachian Basin Province crosses [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], eastern [[Ohio]], [[West Virginia]], western [[Maryland]], eastern [[Kentucky]], western [[Virginia]], eastern [[Tennessee]], northwestern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and northeastern [[Alabama]]. The northern end of the Appalachian Basin extends offshore into Lakes [[Lake Erie|Erie]] and [[Lake Ontario|Ontario]] as far as the United States–Canada border. The Appalachian Basin province covers an area of about {{convert|185500|mi2|km2}}. The province is {{convert|1075|mi|km}} long from northeast to southwest and between {{convert|20|to|310|mi|km|-1}} wide from northwest to southeast.&lt;ref name=appBasin&gt;{{USGS|url=http://certmapper.cr.usgs.gov/data/noga95/prov67/text/prov67.pdf|article=Appalachian Basin Province (067)|author=R.T. Ryder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northwestern flank of the basin is a broad [[homocline]] that dips gently southeastward off the [[Cincinnati Arch]]. A complexly thrust faulted and folded [[terrane]] (Appalachian Fold and Thrust Belt or Eastern Overthrust Belt), formed at the end of the Paleozoic by the [[Alleghenian orogeny]], characterizes the eastern flank of the basin. Metamorphic and igneous rocks of the Blue Ridge Thrust Belt that bounds the eastern part of the Appalachian Basin Province were thrust westward more than {{convert|150|mi|km}} over lower Paleozoic sedimentary rocks.&lt;ref name=appBasin/&gt;

====Coal, oil, and gas production====
The Appalachian Basin is one of the most important [[coal]] producing regions in the US and one of the biggest in the world. Appalachian Basin [[bituminous coal]] has been mined throughout the last three centuries. Currently, the coal primarily is used within the eastern U.S. for [[electrical power generation]], but some of it is suitable for [[metallurgy|metallurgical]] uses. Economically important coal beds were deposited primarily during [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] time in a southeastward-thickening [[foreland basin]]. Coal and associated rocks form a [[clastic]] wedge that
thickens from north to south, from Pennsylvania into southeast West Virginia and southwestern Virginia.&lt;ref name=coal&gt;{{USGS|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1625c/CHAPTER_A/CHAPTER_A.pdf|article=Executive Summary—Coal Resource Assessment of Selected Coal Beds and Zones in the Northern and Central Appalachian Basin Coal Regions|author=Leslie F. Ruppert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Appalachian Basin has had a long history of oil and gas production. Discovery of oil in 1859 in the [[Drake Well]], [[Venango County, Pennsylvania]], marked the beginning of the oil and gas industry in the Appalachian Basin. The discovery well opened a prolific trend of oil and gas fields, producing from [[Upper Devonian]], [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]], and Pennsylvanian [[sandstone]] reservoirs, that extends from southern New York, across western Pennsylvania, central West Virginia, and eastern Ohio, to eastern Kentucky.&lt;ref name=appBasin/&gt;

A second major trend of oil and gas production in the Appalachian Basin began with the discovery in 1885 of oil and gas in [[Lower Silurian]] Clinton sandstone reservoirs in [[Knox County, Ohio]]. By the late 1880s and early 1900s, the trend extended both north and south across east-central Ohio and included several counties in western New York where gas was discovered in Lower Silurian Medina Group sandstones. About 1900, large oil reserves were discovered in [[Silurian]] and [[Devonian]] [[carbonate]] reservoirs in east-central Kentucky. Important gas discoveries from the [[Lower Devonian]] Oriskany Sandstone in Cambridge County, Ohio, in 1924, [[Schuyler County, New York]], in 1930, and [[Kanawha County, West Virginia]], in 1936 opened a major gas-producing trend across parts of New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Virginia.&lt;ref name=appBasin/&gt;

Another drilling boom in the Appalachian Basin occurred in the 1960s in [[Morrow County, Ohio]], where oil was discovered in the [[Upper Cambrian]] part of the Knox [[Dolomite]].&lt;ref name=appBasin/&gt;

===Crystalline Appalachians===
[[File:L008.png|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Geological map of the southern Crystalline Appalachians]]
The Blue Ridge, Piedmont, Adirondack, and New England Provinces are collectively known as the Crystalline Appalachians, because they consist of Precambrian and Cambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks.&lt;ref name=nyc&gt;{{cite web |title=The Sedimentary Appalachians |work=NYC Regional Geology |url=http://3dparks.wr.usgs.gov/nyc/valleyandridge/sedimentaryapp.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ySDRYR3s?url=http://3dparks.wr.usgs.gov/nyc/valleyandridge/sedimentaryapp.htm |archivedate=2011-05-05 |accessdate=2010-05-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blue Ridge Thrust Belt Province underlies parts of eight states from central Alabama to southern Pennsylvania. Along its western margin, the Blue Ridge is thrust over the folded and faulted margin of the Appalachian basin, so that a broad segment of Paleozoic strata extends eastward for tens of miles, buried beneath these [[subhorizontal]] crystalline thrust sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=L.D.|last2=Harris|first2=A.G.|last3=de Witt, Jr.|first3=W.|last4=Bayer|first4=K.C.|year=1981|title=Evaluation of the southern eastern overthrust belt beneath Blue Ridge-Piedmont thrust|journal=American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin|volume=65|issue=12|pages=2497–2505|doi=10.1306/03b599ef-16d1-11d7-8645000102c1865d}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the surface, the Blue Ridge consists of a mountainous to hilly region, the main component of which are the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] that extend from Georgia to Pennsylvania. Surface rocks consist mainly of a core of moderate-to high-rank crystalline metamorphic or igneous rocks, which, because of their superior resistance to weathering and erosion, commonly rise above the adjacent areas of low-grade metamorphic and sedimentary rock. The province is bounded on the north and west by the Paleozoic strata of the Appalachian Basin Province and on the south by Cretaceous and younger sedimentary rocks of the Gulf Coastal Plain. It is bounded on the east by metamorphic and sedimentary rocks of the Piedmont Province.&lt;ref name=otherProv&gt;{{USGS|article=Blue Ridge Thrust Belt (068), Piedmont Province (069), Atlantic Coastal Plain Province (070), Adirondack Province (071), and New England Province (072)|url=http://certmapper.cr.usgs.gov/data/noga95/prov71/text/prov71.pdf|author=Robert C. Milici}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Adirondack and New England Provinces include sedimentary, metasedimentary, and plutonic igneous rocks, mainly of Cambrian and Ordovician age, similar lithologically to rocks in the Blue Ridge and Piedmont Provinces to the south. The uplifted, nearly circular [[Adirondack Mountains]] consist of a core of ancient [[Precambrian]] rocks that are surrounded by upturned Cambrian and [[Ordovician]] sedimentary rocks.&lt;ref name=otherProv/&gt;

'''Hamilton Harbour''' is a natural harbour in [[Bermuda]] which serves as the port for the capital, the City of [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]]. It is an arm of the [[Great Sound, Bermuda|Great Sound]], and forms a tapering wedge shape of water between [[Paget Parish, Bermuda|Paget Parish]] and the peninsula which forms [[Pembroke Parish, Bermuda|Pembroke Parish]], and upon which the capital sits.

The approaches to the harbour are protected by a chain of islands (notably [[Hinson's Island, Bermuda|Hinson's]], [[Marshall's Island, Bermuda|Marshall's]], [[Long Island, Bermuda|Long]], and [[Hawkins Island, Bermuda|Hawkins]]), and by the small [[Salt Kettle, Bermuda|Salt Kettle Peninsula]]. Another island sits inside the Harbour itself, [[White's Island]]. The eastern end of the Harbour, the narrow corner of an isosceles triangle, is a small [[mangrove]] grown bay used for mooring smaller pleasure boats.

==History==
[[Image:International One Design - Hamilton Harbour - Bermuda.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The Paget shoreline on the south side of Hamilton Harbour.]]
The name ''Hamilton Harbour'' is taken from the City of Hamilton, itself named for the [[Governor of Bermuda]] at the time of its 1793 founding, Sir [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Henry Hamilton]]. Prior to this, the harbour was known as ''Paget's Port'', taking its name from the parish of [[Paget Parish, Bermuda|Paget]] to its south (the parish having been named for [[William Paget, 4th Baron Paget de Beaudesert]]).

Although superior in many ways to [[St. George's Harbour, Bermuda|St. George's Harbour]] at the east of the archipelago, no easy route of access to Hamilton Harbour for large vessels, from the open ocean through the reefline which surrounded Bermuda, was known until ''the narrows'' was located by a Royal Naval hydrographer who spent twelve years charting Bermuda's reefs following US independence. The reason for the Royal Navy's effort was its development of Bermuda as a major naval base, to replace the bases lost along the US [[Atlantic Seaboard]] when those colonies seceded. Although it initially began operating out of Convict Bay in St. George's Harbour, the Navy began buying up land at the West End of Bermuda with a view to establishing what would become the Royal Naval Dockyard. It also bought up most of the smaller islands in the Great Sound, including those in Hamilton Harbour. Its plans for the development of the base were stymied, however, 'til it could discover a route by which its warships could reach the Great Sound. When it discovered this, allowing naval operations to begin to be transferred to the West End, it also opened the Great Sound and Hamilton Harbour for access by merchant shipping, accelerating the development of the port of Hamilton, and of the central parishes, to the point that by 1815 Hamilton was clearly a more important town than St. George's, and the capital of Bermuda was relocated there.

[[File:Hamilton Harbour in Bermuda 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hamilton Harbour, looking South East from Hamilton towards Paget.]]
Hamilton has remained Bermuda's primary port ever since. Despite dredging of the narrow channels into St. George's Harbour, the largest merchant vessels which visit the island are unable to enter it (many cruise ship operators have preferred in recent decades not to enter it, as Hamilton was seen as a more lucrative destination). The port of Hamilton includes Bermuda's primary freight docks and cruise ship docks along Front Street in Hamilton, as well as yacht marinas in Hamilton, Pembroke, and Paget. Although very large vessels, such as the ships delivering cars and other motor vehicles from factories in Asia, call at Hamilton, recent years have seen an increase in the size of the cruise ships which visit Bermuda to the point that none can fit through the channel into Hamilton Harbour (in past, only the very largest ocean liners, like the QE2 and the Canberra, were unable to enter, being forced to use an anchorage beyond the Great Sound). Today, most cruise ships must moor at the former Royal Naval Dockyard, their passengers using tenders and ferries to reach Hamilton. Despite the suggestion of removing [[White's Island, Bermuds|White's Island]] in order to widen the accessway into Hamilton Harbour, current plans of the Corporation of Hamilton (the municipal government of the City of Hamilton), call for the redevelopment of its docklands for other uses. Even the freight docks may be relocated, though the Corporation of Hamilton earns considerable revenue from them. Even as the commercial applications of the port of Hamilton have dwindled, the use of the Harbour for marinas and pleasure craft has increased in recent years, with both the Royal Hamilton Amateur Dinghy Club and the [[Royal Bermuda Yacht Club]] having greatly expanded their marinas, and with a new, commercially-operated marina having been developed on Pitt's Bay Road.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2584">The '''International Arctic Buoy Program''' is headquartered at the Polar Science Center, Applied Physics Laboratory, [[University of Washington]], in [[Seattle, Washington]], United States.  The program's objectives include to provide [[Meteorology|meteorological]] and [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] data in order to support operations and research for [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Climate Research Programme]] and the [[World Weather Watch Programme]] of the [[United Nations]]'  [[World Meteorological Organization]]. 

IABP participating countries include Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Norway, Russia, and the United States.  Together, they share the costs of the program.

The IABP has deployed more than 700 buoys since it began operations in 1991, succeeding the Arctic Ocean Buoy Program (operational since 1979-01-19).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/indepth_coverage/science/poles/buoys.html |title=Tools of Polar Research |accessdate=2008-05-08 |date=2008-02-06 |publisher=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, 25 to 40 buoys operate at any given time and provide real-time position, pressure, temperature, and interpolated ice velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gcmd.nasa.gov/records/GCMD_G00791.html |title= IABP Drifting Buoy Pressure, Temperature, Position, and Interpolated Ice Velocity |accessdate=2008-05-08 |date=May 2008 |publisher=nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In support of the [[International Polar Year]], the IABP will deploy over 120 buoys, at over 80 different locations, during the period of April-August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=

The '''Irish grid reference system''' is a system of geographic [[grid reference]]s used for paper mapping in [[Ireland]] (both [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osi.ie/education/map-reading/how-to-use-map-scales-and-grids/ How to Use Map Scales and Grids] OSI&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish grid partially overlaps the [[British national grid reference system|British grid]], and uses a similar co-ordinate system but with a meridian more suited to its westerly location.

==Usage==
In general, neither [[Ireland]] nor [[Great Britain]] uses [[latitude]] or [[longitude]] in describing internal geographic locations. Instead [[grid reference]] systems are used for mapping.

The national grid referencing system was devised by the [[Ordnance Survey]], and is heavily used in their survey data, and in maps (whether published by the [[Ordnance Survey of Ireland]], the [[Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland]] or commercial map producers) based on those surveys.  Additionally grid references are commonly quoted in other publications and data sources, such as guide books or government planning documents.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:OS grid key Ireland.gif|right]] --&gt;
In 2001, the Ordnance Survey of Ireland and the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland jointly implemented a new coordinate system for Ireland called [[Irish Transverse Mercator]], or ITM, a location-specific optimisation  of [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM]]], which runs in parallel with the existing Irish grid system.  In both systems, the true origin is at 53°&amp;nbsp;30'&amp;nbsp;N, [[8th meridian west|8°&amp;nbsp;W]]{{cn|date=February 2018}} — a point in [[Lough Ree]], close to the western ([[County Roscommon|Co. Roscommon]]) shore, whose grid reference is [http://getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm?mapAction=gaz&amp;gazName=g&amp;gazString=N000500 N 000 500]. This system is used for high accuracy professional digital mapping and surveying.

==Grid letters==
[[File:Irish Grid.svg|thumb|right|Irish grid]]
The area of Ireland is divided into 25 squares, measuring {{convert|100|by|100|km|abbr=on}}, each identified by a single letter. The squares are numbered A to Z with I being omitted. Seven of the squares do not actually cover any land in Ireland: A, E, K, P, U, Y and Z.

==Eastings and northings==
Within each square, eastings and northings from the origin (south west corner) of the square are given numerically.  For example, G0305 means 'square G, {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} east, {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} north'.  A location can be indicated to varying resolutions numerically, usually from two digits in each coordinate (for a {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} square) through to five (for a {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}}) square; the most common usage is the ''six figure grid reference'', employing three digits in each coordinate to determine a {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} square.

Coordinates may also be given relative to the origin of the entire {{convert|500|by|500|km|abbr=on}} grid (in the format easting, northing). For example, the location of the [[Spire of Dublin]] on [[O'Connell Street]] may be given as 315904, 234671 as well as O1590434671. Coordinates in this format must never be truncated, because, for example, 31590, 23467 is also a valid location.

'''John Melish''' (June 13, 1771 - December 30, 1822) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] mapmaker who published some of the earliest maps of the [[United States]] (US). In 1816 he created  the first map of the United States extending to the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="Monticello"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/john-melish | title=John Melish | publisher=monticello.org | accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Imagining"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/west/cgi-bin/pager.php?id=50 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130616050014/http://www.stanford.edu/group/west/cgi-bin/pager.php?id=50 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=June 16, 2013 | title=Imagining Expansion | publisher=Stanford University | work=Exploring the West | accessdate=June 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geographicus"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=CAD&amp;Product_Code=melish | title=John Melish | publisher=Geographicus | accessdate=June 16, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Melish was born in Scotland on June 13, 1771.&lt;ref name=Simpson /&gt; He worked under the tutelage of a cotton merchant in [[Glasgow]] and later tried to form his own cotton import-export company.&lt;ref name=Geographicus /&gt; Between 1806 and 1811, Melish made several trips to the United States,&lt;ref name="Counts"&gt;{{cite book| last = Counts| first = George S.| title = Education and American Civilization| year = 1952| publisher = Teachers College, Columbia University Press| location = New York, NY| isbn = 9781178479607| pages = 97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; finally settling in [[Philadelphia]] in 1811. A year later, he published ''Travels through the United States of America, in the years 1806 &amp; 1807, and 1809, 1810, &amp; 1811'' documenting his voyages to the US with copious maps.&lt;ref name=Geographicus /&gt;

==Philadelphia==
Melish started his own map publishing company in Philadelphia. It was the first of its kind in the United States.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9561 |title = Map of the United States of America: With the Contiguous British and Spanish Possessions, 1816 |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1816 |accessdate = 2013-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His maps were inspired by his travels and fulfilled a contemporary need for accurate cartography. [[US President]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] took note of Melish's maps, sending copies to associates in Europe. In 1816, Melish published an important map, ''Map of the United States with the contiguous British and Spanish Possessions'', which depicted the United States from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, thus implicitly staking a larger claim for the US than existed at that time.&lt;ref name=Geographicus /&gt;

Melish's books detailing the state of American manufacturing influenced Jefferson to adopt a point of view favoring manufacturing in the US, as opposed to shipping raw good to Europe for manufacturing into finished products.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;{{cite book| last = Boyd| first = Julian P.| title = Thomas Jefferson and the New Nation – A Biography| url = https://books.google.com/?id=O4YtngEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA940| year = 1970| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = New York, NY| isbn = 9780195019094| pages = 940 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2007}}

'''Kalvebod Fælled''' ("Kalvebod Commons"), also known as '''Vestamager''' ("Western Amager"), takes up roughly one fourth of the island of [[Amager]] near [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].

The area consists of reclaimed [[sea bed]], with a number of former islets making up small isolated hills; it was dammed and drained during the 1940s to serve as an [[artillery]] training range. After active military use ended in 1983, some of the area has been used for transportation infrastructure ([[motorway]] and [[railway]] in connection with the [[Øresund bridge]]), a [[landfill]] on the stip between the motorway and the ocean dyke, a [[golf course]] and the southern end of the [[Ørestad]] urban development. Most of the area, however, lies as lightly maintained parkland featuring a range of nature types, from young forests to [[tidal marsh]]es; some areas are prevented from developing into forests by grazing livestock and game. After years of preparation the area was finally cleared of unexploded munitions and fully opened to the general public on October 15, 2010.

Previously, because of the risk of unexploded munitions, walking outside the paths and roads was generally not allowed. A large area in the southwestern corner is set aside under the [[Natura 2000]]-scheme as an [[European Union|EU]]-recognized [[Special Protection Area|bird protection area]] to which the general public has no access.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12967">The '''Birds of''' '''[[Christmas Island]]''' form a heterogeneous group of over 100 species.  There is a core group of ten [[endemism|endemics]] that have evolved on the remote island in the eastern [[Indian Ocean]] for thousands of years, attended by a suite of regular migrants, opportunists and occasional visitors.  Some 200&amp;nbsp;km from the nearest land, [[Java]], Christmas Island was not occupied by humans until the late 19th century.  It is now an [[Australia]]n territory.  The natural vegetation of most of the 140&amp;nbsp;km² island is [[rainforest]], to which the endemic landbirds are adapted, while the [[seabird]]s have taken advantage of a breeding location which had no major natural predators.

After over a century of human exploitation of the [[phosphate]] deposits covering much of the island, two thirds of the rainforest cover remains and is now protected as a [[national park]].  However, gaps where the forest has been cleared, and the introduction of exotic fauna, continue to destabilise the island’s [[biological diversity]].  The endemic [[Abbott's booby]] is threatened when nesting by wind turbulence caused by past forest clearance.  However, the biggest immediate threat is the introduction and spread of [[yellow crazy ant]]s, through both direct predation and ecosystem collapse.  This has led to all the island’s endemic bird species and subspecies being classified as [[Critically Endangered]].

Meanwhile, the number of species recorded from Christmas Island continues to increase as [[birder]]s, especially from Australia, attracted by the island’s endemics, record a variety of vagrants previously unnoticed.  Some of these may in time, as with the [[white-breasted waterhen]], establish breeding populations.  Christmas Island is now seen as a birding ‘hot spot’, not only for its endemics but also for the chance of recording new species for the Australian bird list, something reflected in the frequency of submissions of sightings to the [[Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union|Birds Australia]] Rarities Committee.

This is a '''list of the most populous first-level administrative [[lists of country subdivisions|country subdivisions]]''' in the world, in order of population; most estimates are from 2004, some from 2008. Excluded are regions defined for convenience, that do not have their own single government: e.g. [[Calabarzon]], [[East China]], [[Kantō region]] and [[Northeastern United States]]. Those subdivisions which are the largest in their respective countries are shown in '''bold'''. Countries which have a high proportion of their population enumerated in the largest subdivision include the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] (98.3% in the [[Netherlands]]), the [[United Kingdom]] (80.3% in [[England]]) and [[Pakistan]] (53.7% in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]]). England appears on this list, but does not have a [[governance of England|single government]] because it is a [[constituent state|constituent country]].

'''Mobile mapping''' is the process of collecting [[geospatial]] data from a mobile [[vehicle]],&lt;ref&gt;Vitrià, et al. (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=P7FYs0IvbpoC&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=mobile%20mapping&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q=mobile%20mapping&amp;f=false p.69] Retrieved June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; typically fitted with a range of [[photographic]], [[radar]], [[laser scanning|laser]], [[LiDAR]] or any number of [[remote sensing]] systems. Such systems are composed of an integrated array of time synchronised [[navigation]] sensors and [[Photography|imaging]] sensors mounted on a mobile platform.&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann-Wellenhof, B., et al. (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=losWr9UDRasC&amp;lpg=PA379&amp;dq=mobile%20mapping&amp;pg=PA379#v=onepage&amp;q=mobile%20mapping&amp;f=false p.379-380.] Retrieved June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary output from such systems include [[GIS]] data, digital [[map]]s, and [[georeference]]d images and video.

== History ==

The development of direct reading [[georeference|georeferencing]] technologies opened the way for mobile mapping systems. [[GPS]] and [[Inertial Navigation System]]s, have allowed rapid and accurate determination of [[Location (geography)|position]] and [[:wikt:attitude|attitude]] of [[remote sensing]] equipment,&lt;ref&gt;Tao, C. V. (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=tWUfPdng_o0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=mobile%20mapping&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.5.] Retrieved June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; effectively leading to direct mapping of features of interest without the need for complex post-processing of observed data.

== Applications ==

=== Aerial mobile mapping ===

Traditional [[Topographic surveying and mapping|techniques]] of geo-referencing aerial photography, [[ground profiling radar]], or [[Lidar]] are prohibitively expensive, particularly in inaccessible areas, or where the type of data collected makes interpretation of individual features difficult. Image direct georeferencing, simplifies the mapping control for large scale mapping tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Gao, J. (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KHXSKc1bfusC&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=mobile%20mapping&amp;pg=PA196#v=onepage&amp;q=mobile%20mapping&amp;f=false p.196.] Retrieved June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emergency response planning ===

Mobile mapping systems allow rapid collection of data to allow accurate assessment of conditions on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sisi Zlatanova|Zlatanova]], et al. (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=m-2RMTpe7WEC&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=mobile%20mapping&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q=mobile%20mapping&amp;f=false p.103.] Retrieved June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet applications ===

Internet, and [[mobile device]] users, are increasingly utilising geo-spatial information, either in the form of mapping, or geo-referenced imaging. Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo have adapted both aerial photographs and satellite images to develop online mapping systems. ''[[Google Street View|Street View]]'' type images are also an increasing market.&lt;ref&gt;Tao, C.V. (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=tWUfPdng_o0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=mobile%20mapping&amp;pg=PR13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.xiii.] Retrieved June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Location aware [[PDA]] systems rely on geo-referenced features collated from mobile mapping sources.&lt;ref&gt;Weng, Q. (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=VtXSBy4-UH0C&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=mobile%20mapping&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q=mobile%20mapping&amp;f=false p.70.] Retrieved June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Road mapping and highway facility management ===

GPS combined with digital camera systems allow rapid update of road maps.&lt;ref&gt;Tao, C.V. (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KHXSKc1bfusC&amp;lpg=PA614&amp;dq=mobile%20mapping&amp;pg=PA614#v=onepage&amp;q=mobile%20mapping&amp;f=false p.614.] Retrieved June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Hammoudi et al. (2013) [https://doi.org/10.5772%2F56570 p.10.] Retrieved November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same system can be utilised to carry out efficient road condition surveys,&lt;ref&gt;Zlatanova, et al. (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=m-2RMTpe7WEC&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=mobile%20mapping&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q=mobile%20mapping&amp;f=false p.113.] Retrieved June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and facilities management.&lt;ref&gt;Gavrilova, M.L.

'''Ngatpang''' is one of [[Palau]]'s sixteen [[States of Palau|states]].  It comprises an area of around 47 square kilometers in the west of Palau's largest island, [[Babeldaob]], facing onto [[Ngeremeduu Bay]].  The state capital is [[Oikuul]]. It has a [[population]] of 464, making it Palau's 5th largest state in population.

[[Ibobang]] is in Ngatpang.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Ben. ''Federated States of Micronesia and Palau''. [[Other Places Publishing]], 2010. {{ISBN|0982261934}}, 9780982261934. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjOX7ySEURYC&amp;pg=PA207 207]. " Only about 8% of Palauans practice Modekngei, most of whom reside in the same village, Ibobang. This small town of less than 100 in Ngatpang state[...]"&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a community dedicated to the practice of the [[Modekngei]] religion.

==Education==
The [[Ministry of Education (Palau)|Ministry of Education]] operates public schools.

Ibobang Elementary School is in Ibobang. When it opened it relieved Ngatpang Elementary School.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.palaumoe.net/ibobang/ Ibobang Elementary School]." Ministry of Education (Palau). Retrieved on February 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Palau High School]] in [[Koror]] is the country's only public high school, so many children from this community go there.&lt;ref name=about&gt;"[http://www.palaumoe.net/phs/about.php About]." [[Palau High School]]. Retrieved on February 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
Others go to the [[Belau Modekngei School]], a boarding school in Ibobang.

==Location==
The lake is situated in [[Oguta]] about thirty miles (48.27&amp;nbsp;km) from the junction  of  the [[Ogba–Egbema–Ndoni|Ndoni]] and [[Orashi River]].It is a fine piece of water, being  about five miles (8.05&amp;nbsp;km) long from east to west and a mile and half (2.41&amp;nbsp;km) wide.&lt;ref name="onlineresearchjournals.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlineresearchjournals.com/aajoss/art/77.pdf |title=The Aro, Host Communities And Continuties In Intergroup Suspicion In The Oguta Area Since Pre-colonial Times |page=1 |first=Uche Uwaezuoke |last=Okonkwo |journal=Afro Asian Journal of Social Sciences |volume=2 |issue=2.4 |date=2011 |issn=2229-5313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stream from [[Njaba River]] is the major inflow to Oguta Lake.&lt;ref name="onlineresearchjournals.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlineresearchjournals.com/aajoss/art/77.pdf |title=The Aro, Host Communities And Continuties In Intergroup Suspicion In The Oguta Area Since Pre-colonial Times |page=1 |first=Uche Uwaezuoke |last=Okonkwo |journal=Afro Asian Journal of Social Sciences |volume=2 |issue=2.4 |date=2011 |issn=2229-5313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other 3 tributaries are [[Awbana River|Awbana]], Utu and [[Orashi River|Orashi]]. The [[Orashi River]] flows past Oguta Lake in its southwestern portion.

==Economic Importance==
The lake is important to the people of oil-rich [[Njaba River]] basin including [[Oguta]], [[Orsu]], [[Mgbidi]], [[Nkwesi]], [[Osemotor]], [[Awo-Omamma]] and [[Izombe]] as a source of water, fish, tourism and an outlet for [[sanitary sewer|sewerage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilec.or.jp/database/afr/afr-18.html |title=OGUTA LAKE |publisher=www.ilec.or.jp |accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uhamiri is the goddess of the Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Igbo women and economic transformation in southeastern Nigeria, 1900-1960 |first=Gloria |last=Chuku |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |isbn=0-415-97210-8 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade Route==
The river route [[Njaba River|Njaba]] and [[Orashi River|Orashi]] via Oguta Lake to the coast, passing through [[Awo-omamma]], [[Mgbidi]], [[Oguta]], [[Ogba–Egbema–Ndoni|Ndoni]], [[Abonnema]], made [[Oguta]], [[Osemotor]], [[Awo-omamma]] and surrounding towns  important  commercial  centres  of  international trade mainly for oil palm.&lt;ref name="onlineresearchjournals.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlineresearchjournals.com/aajoss/art/77.pdf |title=The Aro, Host Communities And Continuties In Intergroup Suspicion In The Oguta Area Since Pre-colonial Times |page=1 |first=Uche Uwaezuoke |last=Okonkwo |journal=Afro Asian Journal of Social Sciences |volume=2 |issue=2.4 |date=2011 |issn=2229-5313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oguta Lake also served as a [[Biafra]]n army marine base during the [[Nigerian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlakes.org/lakedetails.asp?lakeid=8355|title=LakeNet -Lakes|publisher=www.worldlakes.org|accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is noted for his contributions to the exploration of [[Australia]], particularly the [[Snowy Mountains]] and [[Tasmania]] as well as climbing and naming the highest mountain on the continent – [[Mount Kosciuszko]] (2,228 m).
 
==Early years==
Strzelecki was born in 1797, in Glausche, [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (today the town is called [[Głuszyna, Greater Poland Voivodeship|Głuszyna]], part of [[Nowe Miasto, Poznań]], [[Poland]]), the third child of Franciszek Strzelecki, a Polish nobleman ([[Szlachta|szlachcic]]) leasing land, and his wife, Anna Raczyńska.&lt;ref name=dab&gt;{{Dictionary of Australian Biography|First=Sir Paul Edmund de|Last=Strzelecki|shortlink=0-dict-biogSt-Sy.html#strzelecki1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, Strzelecki was called a ''Count'', though there is no proof that he actually approved or used such a title himself. 

Strzelecki served shortly in the [[Prussian Army]] in the 6th Regiment of Thuringischen [[Uhlan]]s, at the time known as Polish Regiment because so many Poles served on the staff. However, the stiff Prussian drill did not agree with his character and he submitted his resignation and returned home. There are some suggestions&lt;ref&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Heney|first=Helen|year=1967|id=A020457b|title=Strzelecki, Sir Paul Edmund de [Count Strzelecki]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he deserted the Regiment but in the official history of the Regiment the name Strzelecki does not appear.&lt;ref&gt;Paszkowski, Lech, Sir Paul Edmund de Strzelecki. Arkadia, Australian Scholarly Publishing 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after, he became a tutor at the manor of local nobility. He fell in love with his young student, a girl of 15, Adyna Turno, but was rejected as a suitor by her father, Adam Turno. There are stories that Strzelecki attempted unsuccessfully to elope with Adyna, but biographers find this unlikely. Adyna and Strzelecki exchanged letters over 40 years but they never married. Strzelecki, provided with funds by his family, travelled in [[Austria]] and [[Italy]]. He eventually came under the notice of [[Sapieha family|Prince Sapieha]], who placed him in charge of a large estate in the Russian-occupied part of Poland. Strzelecki was then about 26 years of age and carried out his duties very successfully. Some years later the prince died, and a dispute arose between his son and heir, Eustace, and Strzelecki. Eustace refused to pay Strzelecki the prince's bequest – a huge sum of money and a considerable estate – accusing him of bad faith and prevarication. After four years the dispute was settled. Strzelecki left Poland about 1829 and stayed some time in [[France]], from where he travelled to [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pgi.gov.pl/gdansk/wody-podziemne-pomorza/135-kopalnia-wiedzy-nowe/historia-geologii/2109-pawes-edmund-strzelecki.html |title=Paweł Edmund Strzelecki |access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://podroze.onet.pl/aktywnie/pawel-edmund-strzelecki/t6264dd |title=Paweł Edmund Strzelecki |access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June 1834, he sailed from [[Liverpool]] to New York. He travelled widely in North and South America, [[Cuba]], [[Tahiti]] and the [[Polynesia|South Sea Islands]], and went to [[New Zealand]] probably about the beginning of 1839.&lt;ref name="dab" /&gt;

==Australia==
[[File:Jindabyne-Strzelecki statue.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of Strzelecki in [[Jindabyne, New South Wales|Jindabyne]]]]
He arrived at Sydney on 25 April 1839. He visited the estate of his friend James Macarthur at Camden. He wrote about meeting the German [[vintners]] that the Macarthurs had brought to Australia from the [[Rheingau]] region.&lt;ref&gt;https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/german_vinedressers_in_camden&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "I had gone with my host to look at the farm, the fields, and the vineyard, — contiguous to which last stood in a row six neat cottages, surrounded with kitchen gardens, and inhabited by six families of German vine-dressers, who emigrated two years ago to New South Wales, either driven there by necessity, or seduced by the hope of finding, beyond the sea, fortune, peace, and happiness, – perhaps justice and liberty. The German salutation which I gave to the group that stood nearest, was like some signal-bell, which instantly set the whole colony in motion. Fathers, mothers, and children came running from all sides to see, to salute, and to talk to the gentleman who came from Germany. They took me for their fellow-countryman, and were happy, questioning me about Germany, the Rhine, and their native town. I was far from undeceiving them."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Edmund de Strzelecki, Physical Description of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, London, 1845, p 462&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of the [[Governor of New South Wales]], Sir [[George Gipps]], he made a geological and mineralogical survey of the [[Gippsland]] region in present-day eastern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], where he made many discoveries. He discovered gold in 1839, but Gipps feared the effects of gold on the colony and persuaded Strzelecki to keep his discovery secret.

Later in 1839 Strzelecki set out on an expedition into the [[Australian Alps]] and explored the [[Snowy Mountains]] with James Macarthur, James Riley and two [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] guides: Charlie Tarra and Jackey. In 1840 he climbed the highest peak on mainland Australia and named it [[Mount Kosciuszko]], to honour [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]], one of the national heroes of Poland and a hero of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. On Victorian maps (but never on New South Wales maps) the name Mount Kosciusko was erroneously connected to the neighbouring peak, at present known as [[Mount Townsend]]&lt;ref&gt;Dowd, B.T. 'The Cartography of Mount Kosciusko', Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society vol. 26 Part I (1940) pp. 97–107&lt;/ref&gt; and causing later many confusions, including the recent incorrect information on swapping the names of the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/6a446874c613a955ca2569e300158043/ Mountain Systems (Orography) of Australia], ''Year Book Australia 1910'', [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From there Strzelecki made a journey through Gippsland. After passing the [[La Trobe River]] it was found necessary to abandon the horses and all the specimens that had been collected and try to reach [[Western Port]]. For 22 days they were on the edge of starvation and were ultimately saved by the knowledge and hunting ability of their guide Charlie, who caught native animals for them to eat. The party, practically exhausted, arrived at Western Port on 12 May 1840 and reached [[Melbourne]] on 28 May.

From 1840 to 1842, based in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], Tasmania (then known as [[Van Diemen's Land]]), Strzelecki explored nearly every part of the island, usually on foot with three men and two pack horses. The [[Governor of Tasmania|Lieutenant-Governor]], Sir [[John Franklin]], and his wife, [[Jane Franklin|Lady Jane]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maloney|first=Shane|authorlink=Shane Maloney|date=June 2010|title=Count Paul Strzelecki &amp; Lady Jane Franklin|journal=[[The Monthly]]|issue=57|page=74|issn=1832-3421}}&lt;/ref&gt; afforded him every help in his scientific endeavours.

Strzelecki left Tasmania on 29 September 1842 by steamer and arrived in Sydney on 2 October. He was collecting specimens in northern New South Wales towards the end of that year, and on 22 April 1843, he left Sydney after having travelled {{Convert|11000|km|mi|-3|abbr=off}} through New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, examining the geology along the way. He went to England after visiting China, the [[East Indies]] and Egypt. In 1845 he published his ''Physical Description of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land'' which was awarded the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society]] in May 1846.

In 1845 he became a naturalised British subject.

==Europe==
Towards the end of 1846, the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] was underway and the [[British Relief Association]] formed with the sum of £500,000 subscribed for the relief of the sufferers. Strzelecki was appointed an agent of the Association to superintend the distribution of supplies in [[County Sligo]], [[County Mayo]] and [[County Donegal]]. He devoted himself to his task with success, though he was for a time incapacitated by famine fever. In 1847 and 1848 he continued his work in Dublin as sole agent for the Association. In recognition of his services, he was made a Companion of the [[Order of the Bath]] (CB) in November 1848. He helped impoverished Irish families to seek new lives in Australia. It has been estimated that the various works in which he was involved saved 200,000 Irish lives. (There is a commemorative plaque dedicated to him on [[O'Connell Street|Sackville Place]], Dublin&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.ie/maps/place/Sir+Pawe%C5%82+Edmund+Strzelecki+Memorial/@53.3489191,-6.259371,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1s-_ueyi7y-eKA%2FWC2oz0BkrEI%2FAAAAAAABneU%2F-afmrNYZfyEB7eV268wk0WOCFbCXtuxHwCLIB!2e4!3e12!6s%2F%2Flh4.googleusercontent.com%2F-_ueyi7y-eKA%2FWC2oz0BkrEI%2FAAAAAAABneU%2F-afmrNYZfyEB7eV268wk0WOCFbCXtuxHwCLIB%2Fw86-h123-k-no%2F!7i1429!8i2048!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x2be47c2757297436!2sAbbey+Theatre!8m2!3d53.3484661!4d-6.2574136!3m4!1s0x0:0x66b48478994b64fc!8m2!3d53.3489318!4d-6.2593766!6m1!1e1 photograph of the plaque in Dublin]&lt;/ref&gt;). He was also active in helping injured soldiers during the [[Crimean War]], being personally acquainted with [[Florence Nightingale]].

Strzelecki arrived back to London in 1849, where he was made a [[fellow]] of the Royal Geographical Society and was awarded its [[Gold Medal (RGS)|gold medal]] for "exploration in the south eastern portion of Australia". The Society still displays his huge geological map of New South Wales and Tasmania for public viewing. He was also made a fellow of the [[Royal Society]], having gained widespread recognition as an explorer as well as a philanthropist.

Strzelecki died of liver cancer in London in 1873 and was buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]]. In 1997 his remains were transferred to the crypt &lt;ref&gt;P.E.Strzelecki [http://mtkosciuszko.org.au/english/strzelecki-missing.htm transferred to the crypt]&lt;/ref&gt; of merit of St. Wojciech Church in his hometown of [[Poznań]], Poland.

==Awards and honours==
He was awarded an honorary degree from the [[University of Oxford]], appointed a Companion of the [[Order of the Bath]]  (CB), and knighted as a Knight Commander of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] (KCMG) in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=23512 |page=3750 |date=1 July 1869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 he was honoured on a postage stamp depicting his portrait issued by [[Australia Post]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0014560.jpg Stamp depicting Strzelecki]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In [[20th century]] de-facto control over this area frequently changed. In 1930 Russian Federation established ''Ritsinsky Reserve''. When [[Georgian independence referendum, 1991|Georgia reestablished it independence in 1991]] the territory of reserve was enlarged and modern '''Ritsa Strict Nature Reserve'''  established. With outbreak of [[Abkhaz–Georgian conflict]] and subsequent war, de-facto control is presently exercised by government of [[Abkhazia]], which established here in 1996 ''Ritsinsky Relic National Park''.&lt;ref name="Lilium"&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312644918_Modern_State_of_Populations_of_Rare_Endem_LiliumKesselringianumMiscz_in_Ritsinsky_Relic_National_Park_Republic_of_Abkhazia Modern State of Populations of Rare Endem Lilium Kesselringianum Miscz. in Ritsinsky Relic National Park (Republic of Abkhazia)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=“park”&gt;[https://www.tourister.ru/world/europe/abkhazija/city/gagra/nationalparks/16745 Ritsinsky Relic National Park]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:SmallRitsa.JPG|250px|left|thumb|[[Lake Smaller Ritsa]].]]
'''Ritsa Strict Nature Reserve'''  is located in the mountainous part of [[Abkhazia]] on the southern slope of the [[Greater Caucasus range]], covering territory from the Gegi River gorge to the Pshchitsa River gorge. 
The strong differentiation of the relief from 100 m to 3,256 thousand meters above sea level ([[Mount Agepsta]]) creates a rich spectrum of ecological conditions for the growth of many plants and animal habitats &lt;ref name="protectedplanet" /&gt;
The largest, beautiful and famous is [[Lake Ritsa]]. Other lakes - [[Lake Smaller Ritsa|Smaller Ritsa]], [[:ru:Голубое озеро (Абхазия)|Blue Lake]] - no less picturesque and beautiful. There are also several [[waterfall]]s here, the most famous among them is the Gegsky waterfall, with height at about 55 meters.

== Flora ==
The protected area of [[Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests]] has many evergreen boxwood ([[Buxus colchica]]) groves as well as specimens of the [[Nordmann Fir]] ([[Abies nordmanniana]]), which reach heights of over 70 meters (over 230 ft.), and specimens of [[European yew]] ([[Taxus baccata]]) &lt;ref name="yew"&gt;Arnold Gegechkori [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1512188718300836#bbib25 Patterns of distribution and survival of European yew (Taxus baccata L.) in an alpine tree line ecotone in the Greater Caucasus (Georgia)] Annals of Agrarian Science Volume 16, Issue 2, June 2018, Pages 170-176&lt;/ref&gt;
There are variety of rare endemic specimens, such as [[Lilium kesselringianum]]&lt;ref name="Lilium" /&gt;, [[Primula farinosa]] &lt;ref name="Primula"&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284748695_To_Biology_of_a_Rare_Species_of_Primula_Farinosa_L_in_Ritsinsky_Relic_National_Park_Abkhazia_Republic To Biology of a Rare Species of Primula Farinosa L. in Ritsinsky Relic National Park (Abkhazia Republic)]&lt;/ref&gt; and others, such as widespread in reserve [[Campanula|bellflower]] ([[Campanula]]).

== Fauna ==
[[Mammals]] are represented by Caucasian Red Deer ([[Cervus elaphus maral]]), [[West Caucasian tur]] ([[Capra caucasica]]), ([[Rupicapra]]), ([[Capreolus]]), [[wild boar]], [[Caucasian wildcat]] ([[Felis silvestris caucasica]]), forest marten, rabbits.

Very rich is local world of birds - more than 273 species, 71 of which are rare. About 100 species of birds nest here and others passes through the park via the East Black Sea [[Flyway]]. Here one can see the [[golden eagle]] ([[Aquila chrysaetos]]), [[griffon vulture]] ([[Gyps fulvus]]), [[cinereous vulture]] ([[Aegypius monachus]]), [[common blackbird]] ([[Turdus merula]]), [[great tit]] ([[Parus major]]), [[Caucasian snowcock]] ([[Tetraogallus caucasicus]]), [[Caucasian grouse]] ([[Lyrurus mlokosiewiczi]]), [[red-fronted serin]] ([[Serinus pusillus]]), [[goldcrest]] ([[Regulus regulus]]), [[common chaffinch]] ([[Fringilla coelebs|Fringilla coelebs solomkoi]]).

There are also a rare species of frog: the [[Caucasian parsley frog]] ([[Pelodytes caucasicus]]), the [[Caucasian toad]] ([[Bufo verrucosissimus]]), and the endemic [[southern banded newt]] ([[Ommatotriton vittatus]]) and more common [[caucasus viper]] ([[Vipera kaznakovi]]).

'''Réunion''' ({{lang-fr|La Réunion}}, {{IPA-fr|la ʁe.ynjɔ̃|pron|Lareunion.ogg}}; previously ''Île Bourbon'') is an [[overseas department and region of France]] and an [[island]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], east of [[Madagascar]] and {{convert|175|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Mauritius]]. {{As of|January 2018}}, it had a population of 865,826.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt; It has the highest [[per capita GDP]] in the Indian Ocean.

The island has been inhabited since the 16th century, when people from France and Madagascar settled there. Slavery was abolished on 20 December 1848 (a date celebrated yearly on the island), after which [[indentured workers]] were brought from [[South India]], among other places. The island became an [[overseas department]] of France in 1946.

As in France, the official language is [[French language|French]]. In addition, the majority of the region's population speaks [[Réunion Creole]].

Administratively, Réunion is one of the overseas departments of France. Like the other four overseas departments, it is also one of the 18 [[regions of France]], with the modified status of [[overseas region]], and an integral part of the republic with the same status as [[Metropolitan France]]. Réunion is an [[Special member state territories and the European Union|outermost region]] of the [[European Union]] and, as an overseas department of France, part of the [[Eurozone]].&lt;ref&gt;Réunion is pictured on all [[Euro banknotes]], on the back at the bottom of each note, right of the Greek ΕΥΡΩ (EURO) next to the denomination.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:10-cent-1816-Isle-Bourbon.jpg|thumb|A 1816 10-cent coin, Isle de Bourbon]]
Not much is known of Réunion's history prior to the arrival of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in the early 16th century.&lt;ref name=Allen09&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVmqM7F-J4QC&amp;pg=PA9|title=Slaves, Freedmen and Indentured Laborers in Colonial Mauritius|first=Richard B.|last=Allen|date=14 October 1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab traders were familiar with it by the name ''Dina Morgabin''.&lt;ref name=Tabuteau13&gt;{{Cite book |title=Histoire de la justice dans les Mascareignes |last=Tabuteau |first=Jacques |language=French |trans-title=|year=1987 |publisher=Océan éditions |location=Paris |isbn=2-907064-00-2 |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BmgwAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=2011-06-11 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The island is possibly featured on a map from 1153 AD by [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|Al Sharif el-Edrisi]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The island might also have been visited by [[Swahili people|Swahili]] or [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] (Ancient Indonesian–Malaysian) sailors on their journey to the west from the [[Malay Archipelago]] to Madagascar.&lt;ref name=Allen09/&gt;

The first European discovery of the area was made around 1507 by Portuguese explorer [[Diogo Fernandes Pereira]], but the specifics are unclear. The uninhabited island might have been first sighted by the expedition led by [[Pedro Mascarenhas|Dom Pedro Mascarenhas]], who gave his name to the island group around Réunion, the [[Mascarene Islands|Mascarenes]].&lt;ref name=Hydro269&gt;{{Cite book |title=Islands in the southern Indian Ocean westward of Longitude 80 degrees east, including Madagascar |last=Moriarty |first=Cpt.

[[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]] is said to have landed on the islands of Réunion and [[Rodrigues]] in 1509.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

By the early 1600s, nominal Portuguese rule had left Santa Apolónia virtually untouched.&lt;ref name=Hydro269/&gt; The island was then occupied by France and administered from [[Port Louis]], [[Mauritius]]. Although the first French claims date from 1638, when François Cauche and Salomon Goubert visited in June 1638,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clicanoo.re/index.php?page=imprimer&amp;id_article=97540 |title=&amp;#124; Journal de l'île de la Réunion |publisher=Clicanoo.re |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the island was officially claimed by Jacques Pronis of France in 1642, when he deported a dozen French [[mutiny|mutineers]] to the island from [[Madagascar]]. The convicts were returned to France several years later, and in 1649, the island was named Île Bourbon after the French royal [[House of Bourbon]]. Colonisation started in 1665, when the [[French East India Company]] sent the first settlers.&lt;ref name=Hydro269/&gt;

[[File:MaheDeLaBourdonnais 2.JPG|thumb|Statue of [[Mahé de La Bourdonnais]] in [[Saint-Denis, Réunion|Saint-Denis]]]]
"Île de la Réunion" was the name given to the island in 1793 by a decree of the [[Convention Nationale]] (the elected revolutionary constituent assembly) with the [[French Revolution|fall of the House of Bourbon in France]], and the name commemorates the union of revolutionaries from [[Marseille]] with the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] in Paris, which took place on 10 August 1792. In 1801, the island was renamed "Île Bonaparte", after First Consul [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the island [[Invasion of Île Bonaparte|was invaded]] by a [[Royal Navy]] squadron led by [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Josias Rowley]] in 1810, who used the old name of "Bourbon". When it was restored to France by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, the island retained the name of "Bourbon" until the fall of the restored Bourbons during the [[French Revolution of 1848]], when the island was once again given the name "Île de la Réunion".&lt;ref name=Hydro269/&gt;

From the 17th to 19th centuries, French colonisation, supplemented by importing Africans, Chinese and [[Indian people|Indians]] as workers, contributed to ethnic diversity in the population. From 1690, most of the non-Europeans were enslaved. The colony abolished slavery on 20 December 1848. Afterwards, many of the foreign workers came as [[indentured worker]]s. The opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 reduced the importance of the island as a stopover on the [[East Indies]] trade route.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[File:Fete des travailleurs indiens.jpg|thumb|[[Hindu]] festival, 19th century]]
During the [[Second World War]], Réunion was under the authority of the [[Vichy regime]] until 30 November 1942, when [[Free French]] forces [[Liberation of La Réunion|took over the island]] with the [[French destroyer Léopard|destroyer ''Léopard'']].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Réunion became a ''[[overseas department|département d'outre-mer]]'' (overseas [[Departments of France|département]]) of France on 19 March 1946. [[INSEE code|INSEE]] assigned to Réunion the department code &lt;tt&gt;974&lt;/tt&gt;, and the region code &lt;tt&gt;04&lt;/tt&gt; when regional councils were created in 1982 in France, including in existing overseas departments which also became overseas regions.

Over about two decades in the late 20th century (1963–1982), 1,630 children from Réunion were relocated to rural areas of [[metropolitan France]], particularly to [[Creuse]], ostensibly for education and work opportunities. That program was led by influential [[Gaullist]] politician [[Michel Debré]], who was an MP for Réunion at the time. Many of these children were abused or disadvantaged by the families with whom they were placed. Known as the [[The Children of Creuse|Children of Creuse]], they and their fate came to light in 2002 when one of them, Jean-Jacques Martial, filed suit against the French state for kidnapping and deportation of a minor.&lt;ref name="Martial2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean-Jacques Martial|title=Une enfance volée|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nYEMAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=2012-09-13|year=2003|publisher=Les Quatre Chemins|isbn=978-2-84784-110-7|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar lawsuits were filed over the following years, but all were dismissed by French courts and finally by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Géraldine Marcon: [http://www.francebleu.fr/societe/chronologie-les-demraches-judiciaires-des-enfants-reunionnais-de-creuse-1230798 CHRONOLOGIE : L'histoire des enfants réunionnais déplacés en métropole] on francebleu.fr.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 and 2006, Réunion was hit by a crippling epidemic of [[chikungunya]], a disease spread by mosquitoes. According to the [[BBC News]], 255,000&amp;nbsp;people on Réunion had contracted the disease as of 26 April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4674376.stm |title=Island disease hits 50,000 people |publisher=BBC News |date=2 February 2006 |accessdate=2007-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighbouring islands of Mauritius and Madagascar also suffered epidemics of this disease during the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/14/2/07-1024_article.htm|title=Chikungunya Fever, Mauritius, 2006|first1=Sanjay|last1=Beesoon|first2=Ellen|last2=Funkhouser|first3=Navaratnam|last3=Kotea|first4=Andrew|last4=Spielman|first5=Rebecca M.|last5=Robich|publisher=|volume=14|issue=2|pages=337–338|doi=10.3201/eid1402.071024|pmid=18258136|pmc=2630048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4777530.stm |title=Madagascar hit by mosquito virus |publisher=BBC News |date=6 March 2006 |accessdate=2007-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few cases also appeared in mainland France, carried by people travelling by airline. The French government of [[Dominique de Villepin]] sent an emergency aid package worth €36&amp;nbsp;million and deployed about 500 troops in an effort to eradicate mosquitoes on the island.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

== Politics ==
{{Main article|Politics of Réunion}}
[[File:EU OCT and OMR map en.png|thumb|right|Map of the European Union in the world with overseas countries and territories and outermost regions]]
Réunion sends seven deputies to the [[National Assembly of France|French National Assembly]] and three senators to the [[Senate of France|Senate]].

== Administrative divisions ==
{{Main article|Arrondissements of the Réunion department|Cantons of the Réunion department|Communes of the Réunion department}}
Administratively, Réunion is divided into 24&amp;nbsp;[[communes of France|''communes'']] (municipalities) grouped into four [[arrondissements of France|''arrondissements'']]. It is also subdivided into 49&amp;nbsp;[[cantons of France|cantons]], meaningful only for electoral purposes at the departmental or regional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/nom_def_met/nomenclatures/cog/CarteD.asp?numreg=04&amp;numdep=974#res |title=Insee - Code Officiel Géographique |publisher=Insee.fr |date= |accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a French overseas department, hence a French overseas region. The low number of ''communes'', compared with French metropolitan departments of similar size and population, is unique: most of its ''communes'' encompass several localities, sometimes separated by significant distances.

The ''communes'' voluntarily grouped themselves into five intercommunalities for cooperating in some domains, apart from the four'' arrondissements'' to which they belong for purposes of applying national laws and executive regulation. After some changes in the composition, name and status of intercommunalities, all of them operate with the status of [[Agglomeration communities in France|agglomeration communities]], and apply their own local taxation (in addition to national, regional, departmental, and municipal taxes) and have an autonomous budget decided by the assembly representing all member communes. This budget is also partly funded by the state, the region, the department, and the [[European Union]] for some development and investment programs. Every ''commune'' in Réunion is now a member of an intercommunality with its own taxation, to which member communes have delegated their authority in various areas.

== Foreign relations ==
Although diplomacy, military, and French government matters are handled by Paris, Réunion is a member of [[La Francophonie]], the [[Indian Ocean Commission]], the [[International Trade Union Confederation]], the [[Universal Postal Union]], the [[Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa]], and the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] in its own right.

{{Réunion location map}}

The island is {{convert|63|km|mi|abbr=on}} long; {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide; and covers {{convert|2512|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. It is above a [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] in the Earth's crust. The [[Piton de la Fournaise]], a [[shield volcano]] on the eastern end of Réunion Island, rises more than {{convert|2631|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] and is sometimes called a sister to Hawaiian volcanoes because of the similarity of climate and volcanic nature. It has erupted more than 100&amp;nbsp;times since 1640, and is under constant monitoring, most recently erupting on 14 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volcanodiscovery.com/piton_fournaise/news.html Piton de la Fournaise] on volcanodiscovery.com&lt;/ref&gt; During another eruption in April 2007, the lava flow was estimated at {{convert|3000000|m3|yd3|abbr=on}} per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Thomas Staudacher |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070407/wl_afp/francereunionvolcano |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409021223/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070407/wl_afp/francereunionvolcano |archivedate=9 April 2007 |title=Reunion sees 'colossal' volcano eruption, but population safe |publisher=[[Agence France Presse|AFP]] |date=7 April 2007 |accessdate=18 August 2007}} (Web archive)&lt;/ref&gt; The hotspot that fuels Piton de la Fournaise also created the islands of [[Mauritius]] and [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]].

The [[Piton des Neiges]] volcano, the highest point on the island at {{convert|3070|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, is northwest of the Piton de la Fournaise. Collapsed calderas and canyons are south west of the mountain. While the Piton de la Fournaise is one of Earth's most active volcanoes, the Piton des Neiges is extinct. Its name means "peak of snows" in French, but snowfall on the summit of the mountain is rare. The slopes of both volcanoes are heavily forested. Cultivated land and cities like the capital city of [[Saint-Denis, Réunion|Saint-Denis]] are concentrated on the surrounding coastal lowlands. Offshore, part of the west coast is characterised by a [[Reunion Island's coral reef|coral reef system]]. Réunion also has three [[caldera]]s: the [[Cirque de Salazie]], the [[Cilaos|Cirque de Cilaos]] and the [[Cirque de Mafate]]. The last is accessible only on foot or by helicopter.

Réunion hosts many tropical and unique beaches. They are often equipped with barbecues, amenities, and parking spaces. Hermitage Beach is the most extensive and best preserved lagoon in Réunion Island and a popular snorkelling location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snorkeling-report.com/spot/ermitage-lagoon-reunion-island/|title=Lagon de l'Ermitage|last=|date=|website=Snorkeling Report|first1=|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a white sand beach lined with casuarina trees under which the locals often organise picnics. La Plage des Brisants is a well-known surfing spot, with many athletic and leisurely activities taking place. Each November, a film festival is also organised in La Plage des Brisants. Movies are projected on a large screen in front of a crowd. Beaches at Boucan {{not a typo|Canot}} are surrounded by a stretch of restaurants that particularly cater to tourists. L’Etang-Salé on the west coast is a particularly unique beach as it is covered in black sand consisting of tiny fragments of basalt. This occurs when lava contacts water, it cools rapidly and shatters into sand and fragmented debris of various size. Much of the debris is small enough to be considered sand. Grand Anse is a tropical white-sand beach lined with coconut trees in the south of Réunion, with a rock pool built for swimmers, a [[pétanque]] playground, and a picnic area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indian-ocean.com/the-beaches-of-reunion-island/|title=The beaches of Réunion Island|date=|website=Snorkeling Report|last1=Ocean|first1=Indian|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Réunion National Park}}
Since 2010, Réunion is home to a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] that covers about 40% of the island's area and coincides with the central zone of the [[Réunion National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1317|title=Pitons, cirques and remparts of Reunion Island|publisher=[[UNESCO]]| accessdate =30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wildlife ===
{{Main article|Wildlife of Réunion}}
{{See also|List of extinct animals of Réunion}}

Réunion is home to a variety of birds such as the [[white-tailed tropicbird]] ({{Lang-fr|paille en queue}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} L'Île de la Réunion.com: [http://www.liledelareunion.com/Fr/Oiseaux/paille.php Le paille en queue]&lt;/ref&gt; Its largest land animal is the [[panther chameleon]], ''Furcifer pardalis.'' Much of the west coast is ringed by coral reef which harbours, among other animals, [[sea urchin]]s, [[conger eel]]s, and [[parrot fish]]. [[Sea turtle]]s and dolphins also inhabit the coastal waters. Humpback whales migrate north to the island from the Antarctic waters annually during the Southern Hemisphere winter (June–September) to breed and feed, and can be routinely observed from the shores of Réunion during this season. At least 19 species formerly [[endemic]] to Réunion have become [[extinct]] following human colonisation. For example, the [[Réunion giant tortoise]] became extinct after being slaughtered in vast numbers by sailors and settlers of the island.

Between 2010 and 2017,  23 shark attacks occurred in the waters of Réunion, of which nine were fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zinfos974.com/Crise-requin-Les-causes-scientifiques-sous-les-projecteurs-de-la-revue-Nature_a124908.html|title=Crise requin: Les causes scientifiques sous les projecteurs de la revue "Nature"|first=Laurence|last=Gilibert|date=1 March 2018|publisher=|via=ZINFO974}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, the [[Prefect of Réunion]] Michel Lalande announced a ban on swimming, surfing, and bodyboarding off more than half of the coast. Lalande also said 45 [[bull shark]]s and 45 [[tiger shark]]s would be [[cull]]ed, in addition to the 20 already killed as part of scientific research into the illness [[ciguatera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/big-read-reunion-island-beset-by-shark-controversy/story-e6frfq80-1226707678565|title=Big Read: Reunion Island beset by shark controversy|work=[[News Corp Australia]]|date=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migrations of [[humpback whale]]s contributed to a boom of [[whale watching]] industries on Réunion, and watching rules have been governed by the [[:fr:Observatoire Marin de la Réunion|OMAR (Observatoire Marin de la Réunion)]] and [[:fr:Globice|Globice (Groupe local d'observation et d'identification des cétacés)]].

=== Gardening - Bourbon roses ===
The first members of the [[Bourbon rose|"Bourbon" group]] of garden roses originated on this island (then still Île Bourbon, hence the name) from a spontaneous [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridisation]] between [[Damask rose]]s and ''[[Rosa chinensis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ADUMITRESEI|first1=LIDIA|last2=STĂNESCU|first2=IRINA|title=Theoretical Considerations upon the origin and nomenclature of the present rose cultivars|journal=Journal of Plant Development|date=2009|volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been brought there by the colonists. The first Bourbon roses were discovered on the island in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rose.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/History-of-Roses-Bourbon-Roses2.pdf |title=History of Roses: Bourbon Roses |work=American Rose Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
[[File:Manapany.jpg|thumb|[[Manapany]]]]
{{Main article|Demographics of Réunion}}
{{See also|Cafres|Malbars|Chinois (Réunion)|Zarabes|Zoreilles}}

Ethnic groups present include people of [[African diaspora|African]], [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian]], [[White people|European]], [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] and [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] origin. Local names for these are Yabs, [[Cafres]], [[Réunionnais of Indian origin|Malbars]] and [[Chinois (Réunion)|Chinois]]. All of the ethnic groups comprising the island are immigrant populations that have come to Réunion from Europe, Asia and Africa over the centuries. There are no indigenous people on the island, as it was originally deserted.&lt;ref name=Bollee&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bollée|first1=Annegret|title=French on the Island of Bourbon (Réunion)|journal=Journal of Language Contact|date=2015|volume=8|issue=1|page=91|doi=10.1163/19552629-00801005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These populations have mixed from the earliest days of the island's colonial history (the first settlers married women from Madagascar and of Indo-Portuguese heritage), resulting in a majority population of [[mixed race]] and of "Creole" culture.

How many people of each ethnicity live in Réunion is not known exactly, since the French census does not ask questions about ethnic origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1236362 |title=SSRN-Why France Needs to Collect Data on Racial Identity - In a French Way by David Oppenheimer |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which applies in Réunion because it is a part of the [[Constitution of France|1958 constitution]], and also because of the extent of racial mixing on the island. According to estimates, [[European diaspora|Whites]] (''petits blancs'' and ''gros blancs'') make up roughly one quarter of the population,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[Tamil people|Tamils]] are the largest group among the [[Indian people|Indian]] community.&lt;ref name="indiandiaspora.nic.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter6.pdf |title=NRI |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island's community of Muslims from north western India, particularly [[Gujarat]], and elsewhere is commonly referred to as ''[[zarabes]]''.
 
[[Réunionnais Creole people|Creoles]] (a name given to those born on the island, regardless of ethnic origins) make up the majority of the population. Groups that are not Creole include people recently arrived from Metropolitan France (known as ''[[zoreilles]]'') and those from [[Mayotte]] and the [[Comoros]].

=== Religion ===
{{See also|Islam in Réunion|Hinduism in Réunion}}
[[File:Cilaos kirche.jpg|thumb|Catholic church of Notre-Dame-des-Neiges in [[Cilaos]]]]

The predominant religion is [[Christianity]], notably [[Roman Catholicism]], with a single (Latin Rite) jurisdiction, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint-Denis-de-La Réunion]]. Religious Intelligence estimates Christians to be 84.9% of the population, followed by [[Hindu]]s (6.7%) and [[Muslim]]s (2.2%).&lt;ref name="religiousintelligence" /&gt; [[Chinese folk religion]] and [[Buddhism]] are also represented, among others.

Most large towns have a [[Hindu temple]] and a [[mosque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Peoples of Africa: Réunion-Somalia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tsqua-r16i4C&amp;pg=PA412|year=2001|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7166-0|pages=412–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
{{See also|Réunionnais literature}}
Réunionese culture is a blend (''métissage'') of European, African, [[Réunionnais of Indian origin|Indian]], [[Chinois (Réunion)|Chinese]] and insular traditions. The most widely spoken language, [[Réunion Creole]], [[French-based creole languages|derives from French]].

=== Language ===
[[French language|French]] is the only official language of Réunion. Although not official, [[Réunion Creole]] is the native language of a large part of the population and is spoken alongside French. Creole is used informally and orally in some administration offices whereas the official language of any administration office as well as education is French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=rcf |title=Ethnologue report (language code:rcf) |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the diverse population, other languages are also spoken such as [[Comorian language|Comorian]] language varieties (especially [[Shimaore]]), [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] by recent immigrants from [[Mayotte]] and Madagascar, [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Hakka language|Hakka]] and [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]]  by members of the Chinese community, but fewer people speak these languages as younger generations start to converse in French and Réunion Creole. There are significant number of speakers of [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] mostly [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Urdu]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is taught in mosques and spoken by a small community of Muslims. English is a compulsory second language as part of the French school curriculum,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} but as in mainland France, English fluency is rare. German and Spanish are offered as a third language. [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] is also taught as an optional language in some schools.&lt;ref name="indiandiaspora.nic.in"/&gt;

Unemployment is a major problem on Réunion, although the situation has improved markedly since the beginning of the 2000s: the unemployment rate, which stood above 30% from the early 1980s to the early 2000s, declined to 24.1% in 2007, then rebounded to 29.6% in 2011 due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 global financial crisis]] and subsequent [[Great Recession]], but has since 2011 again declined, reaching 22.4% in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=lfst_r_lfu3rt&amp;lang=en | title=Unemployment rates by sex, age and NUTS 2 regions (%) | publisher=[[Eurostat]]|accessdate=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; its lowest level in 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Célimène |first1=Fred|last2=Legris|first2=André |date=2011 |title=De l'économie coloniale à l'économie mondialisée - Aspects multiples de la transition (XX&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; et XXI&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècles) |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=n2QkA7LOJC8C&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=%22taux+de+ch%C3%B4mage%22+%22la+r%C3%A9union%22+%221974%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOxLT4s-XZAhXoBsAKHSfSCzsQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22taux%20de%20ch%C3%B4mage%22%20%22la%20r%C3%A9union%22%20%221974%22&amp;f=false  |location=Paris |publisher=Publibook|page=179 |isbn=978-2-7483-7225-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, 40% of the population lived below the poverty line (defined by [[INSEE]] as 60% of [[Metropolitan France]]'s median income; in 2014 the poverty line for a family of 2 parents and 2 young children was €2,064 (US$ 2,743) per month).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/3128421 | title=Quatre Réunionnais sur dix vivent sous le seuil de pauvreté | date=2017|publisher=[[INSEE]] | accessdate=2018-03-12|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005–2006, Réunion experienced an epidemic of [[chikungunya]], a viral disease similar to [[dengue fever]] brought in from East Africa, which infected almost a third of the population because of its transmission through mosquitoes. The epidemic has since been eradicated. See the [[#History|History]] section for more details.

=== Transport ===
{{Main article|Transport in Réunion}}

[[Roland Garros Airport]] serves the island, handling flights to mainland [[France]], [[India]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], [[Tanzania]], [[Comoros]], [[Seychelles]], [[South Africa]], [[China]] and [[Thailand]]. [[Pierrefonds Airport]], a smaller airport, has some flights to Mauritius and Madagascar.

'''Telogis''' was a privately held US-based company that develops location-based software to manage mobile resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr.com/company-profile/overview/64529 |title=Telogis Inc Company Profile |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telogis sold [[software as a service]] (SaaS) which incorporated location information into applications for fleet owners as well as geospatial software development toolkits.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;

In 2016 Telogis was aquired by Verizon Connect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/21/verizon-buys-telogis-to-drive-deeper-into-the-connected-vehicle-market/?guccounter=1|title=Verizon buys Telogis to drive deeper into the connected vehicle market|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Telogis was founded in 2001 by Howard Jelinek, Newth Morris and Ralph Mason, as a trunked radio hardware and software provider. Former [[Novell]] Inc. Chairman and CEO Jack Messman is chairman of the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ocregister.com/jobsearch/telogis-596138-register-bill.html |title=Telogis Focuses on 'Culture of Creativity and Excellence' |date=January 6, 2014 |accessdate=May 23, 2014 |author=Bill Quinnan |publisher=Orange County Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=202738&amp;privcapId=33426620 |accessdate=May 23, 2014 |publisher=BusinessWeek |title=Jack Messman bio}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was started with investments from its founders, and by 2012 the privately held company had approximately $69 million in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/profile/telogis|title=Inc. Telogis Company Profile}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter Don Clark stated of the company's technology that, "Telogis exploited the evolution of software-as-a-service–placing data from vehicles in the cloud ... so that companies that own vehicle fleets can track their cars and trucks without the need to set up their own servers for the purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/10/02/dot-com-bust-survivor-telogis-finally-takes-funding/ |author=Don Clark |publisher=Wall Street Journal |title=Dot-com Bust Survivor Telogis Finally Takes Funding |date=October 2, 2013 |accessdate=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010 Telogis acquired the assets of Remote Dynamics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socaltech.com/telogis_buys_remote_dynamics/s-0029633.html |title=Telogis Buys Remote Dynamics|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; then in February, 2011 Telogis acquired the assets of Intergis, a provider of routing, mobile resource and fleet management software for approximately 2,000 small to mid-sized business fleets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socaltech.com/telogis_buys_integris/s-0033801.html |title=Telogis Buys Integris|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012 Telogis acquired Navtrak. The acquisition resulted in Telogis Navigation, commercial navigation software that gives professional drivers built-in feedback systems to provide up-to-date road network information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socaltech.com/telogis_buys_navtrak/s-0043901.html |title=Telogis Buys Navtrak|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's first outside [[venture capital]] was announced in October 2013, with $93 million from [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{Cite news |title= Telogis Raises $93M From Kleiner Perkins In Pre-IPO Round To Extend Location Intelligence SaaS Platform For New Mobile Workforce |author= Alex Williams |date= October 1, 2013 |work= Tech Crunch |url= https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/01/telogis-raises-93m-from-kleiner-perkins-in-pre-ipo-round-to-extend-location-intelligence-saas-platform-for-new-mobile-workfore/ |accessdate= October 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011 private investors provided $2.9 million.&lt;ref name="funding"&gt;{{Cite news |title= Telogis Raises $2.9 Million More To Help Companies Manage Fleets, Reduce Emissions |work= Tech Crunch |date= February 11, 2011 |author= Lora Kolodny |url= https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/11/telogis-2-9-million-more/ |accessdate= October 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional funding was received from GM Ventures in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= GM Ventures Makes a Strategic Investment in Telogis |publisher= ''Yahoo Finance'' |date= October 27, 2014 |url= https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gm-ventures-makes-strategic-investment-205845142.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 21, 2016, it was announced that Telogis will merge with Verizon via an acquisition. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telogis.com/press-releases/verizon-acquisition-telogis|title=Verizon to enhance significantly its connected vehicle business with the acquisition of Telogis {{!}} Telogis|website=www.telogis.com|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2018, a press release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.morningstar.com/news/pr-news-wire/PRNews_20180306CG30720/introducing-verizon-connect-and-a-new-era-of-connected-vehicle-solutions.html |title=Introducing Verizon Connect and a New Era of Connected Vehicle Solutions |author=Morningstar |date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced that Telogis would be rebranded along with sister companies–[[Fleetmatics]] and Verizon Telematics–as [[Verizon Connect]].

==Software==
Telogis software collects location-based data from embedded and installed hardware in vehicles, as well as from mobile devices. It works on over 40 different hardware platforms from 12 different manufacturers and collects an important array of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/10/02/bootstrapped-telogis-raises-93m-to-bring-location-based-data-to-vehicle-fleets/ |title=Bootstrapped Telogis raises $93M to bring location-based data to vehicle fleets |date=October 2, 2013 |author=Rebecca Grant |accessdate=May 23, 2014 |publisher=Venture Beat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telogis also provides a [[software development kit]] for users to create location-based mobile and desktop applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/28/most-promising-companies-11_Telogis_2FQP.html |title=Telogis |publisher=''Forbes Magazine'' |accessdate=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the primary functions of Telogis's software is to provide United States Federal Government mandated [[hours of service]] commercial driver activity logs.

==OEM Agreements==
Telogis provides a built-in telematics option for several OEMs including Ford, GM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2014/mar/0305-gm-telogis.html |title=GM Offers Fleets Insights on the Road |publisher=''GM'' |date=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volvo, Mack, Hino, Isuzu (United States based trucks), and Manitowoc. This allows fleet owners to opt for factory-installed telematics hardware when purchasing selected new cars and trucks. The advantages include immediate over-the-air activation when adding new vehicles to their fleet management system and additional data points such as DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) quality, water in the diesel and extra DTCs (Diagnostic Trouble Codes) across the body, powertrain and chassis. For off-highway vehicles, Telogis also works with John Deere.&lt;ref&gt;http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/stocks/news/press_release.asp?docTag=201611021400PR_NEWS_USPRX____NY34192&amp;feedID=600&amp;press_symbol=86832&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the OEM built-in options, selected Freightliner trucks offer a pre-wired option that makes it simpler to add the required hardware for tracking trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&amp;tkr=DAI:GR&amp;sid=aeCxiVpcV6Mk |title=Freightliner Trucks to Offer Pre-wire Option for Telogis Telematics Platform |publisher=''Bloomberg'' |date=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
In October 2013 the ''Wall Street Journal'' reported that trucking companies were using Telogis to monitor their drivers, using the data they received to either reward or discipline their drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303672404579151440488919138 |accessdate=May 23, 2014 |title=Memo to Workers: The Boss Is Watching |author=Spencer Ante |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led some employees to become concerned about privacy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aseonline.org/ArticleDetailsPage/tabid/7442/ArticleID/732/Yes-it-is-Big-Brother-You-Got-a-Problem-With-That.aspx |accessdate=May 23, 2014 |title=Yes, it is Big Brother. You Got a Problem With That? |author=Anthony Kaylin |date=November 6, 2013 |publisher=American Society of Employers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Councilman Lewis Rotella of [[Niagara Falls, New York]], stated that, "It’s almost like big brother’s watching you ... You have to put some trust into the employees doing the job," in response to a 2006 contract placing Telogis devices in Niagara city vehicles. He stated further that he believed that such devices can be used to ensure safety, but should not be used for "surreptitiously trailing employees". Rotella also admitted to using the devices himself in his private business to monitor safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niagara-gazette.com/local/x681257825/NIAGARA-FALLS-Technology-gives-bosses-view-from-afar/print |date=November 1, 2006 |publisher=''Niagara Gazette'' |accessdate=May 23, 2014 |title=NIAGARA FALLS: Technology gives bosses view from afar |author=Denise Jewell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Roy, president of [[Mack Trucks]], another Telogis partner, also stated that the software would be used by Mack to help manage workflow and not to track the minute-by-minute decisions of its employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-359627230.html |author=Sean Kilcarr |title=Mack's New President Shares Insight on OEM's Strategic Initiatives |publisher=Fleet Owner |date=February 24, 2014 |accessdate=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
*In March 2014 Telogis was listed among Inc. Magazine's "Build 100" for sustained year-over-year growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/build100/ |title=The Build 100 List of Sustained-Growth Companies|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Fainting Club''' is a members-only [[supper club]] for women, founded in 2014 by artist [[Zoe Crosher]].  Described as an "old boys' club, for girls", it celebrates and draws creative women from multiple disciplines—artists, writers, filmmakers, chefs, musicians—and welcomes any and all like-minded souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/t-magazine/fainting-club-new-york-zoe-crosher-julia-sherman.html|title=A Los Angeles Ladies-Only Dinner Club Migrates to New York|date=5 November 2014|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It now has chapters worldwide including in New York, Mexico City, London, Berlin, Paris and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyork.com/articles/restaurants/fabulous-secret-supper-clubs-in-nyc-98775/|title=8 Fabulous "Secret" Supper Clubs in NYC - March 26, 2015 - NewYork.com|date=26 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All new members must be invited in person or, if distance prevents this, verbally, as connection and conversation are key to the club’s purpose. The only requirement for joining is a generous, collaborative spirit and a willingness to support other women.

But the opposition dismissed that figure as fabricated, pointing to reports of empty polling stations and citing anonymous government sources as putting the figure at just under 2.5 million. The United States has already imposed sanctions on several Venezuelan individuals and organisations, but, in taking the rare step of targeting a sitting head of state by name, it signalled growing alarm at the crisis.

The Smartmatic CEO [[Antonio Mugica]] said: "We know, without a doubt, that the result of the recent elections for a National Constituent Assembly were manipulated," and added "We estimate that the difference between actual and announced participation by the authorities is at least one million votes". [[Reuters]] also reported that according to internal CNE documents leaked to the agency, only 3,720,465 votes were cast thirty minutes before polls were expected to close, though polls were open for an additional hour. The president Maduro stood by the official count of more than 8 million votes and said an additional 2 million people would have voted if they had not been blocked by opposition protesters. "That stupid guy, the president of Smartmatic, pressured to the neck by the gringos and the Britains, said there were 7.5 million [voters]", Maduro said in televised remarks. "I think there were 10 million Venezuelans who went out."  The CNE principal rector [[Tibisay Lucena]] dismissed Mugica's allegations, calling it an "opinion" of a company (Smartmatic) that played only a secondary role in the election and had no access to complete data. [[Julio Borges]], the leader of the opposition-held parliament, said voter fraud was "the most serious crime that can be committed against democracy"''.'' Meanwhile, international pressure mounted on president Maduro as his country and government became increasingly isolated after [[Federica Mogherini]], the European Union's high representative for foreign affairs, said in a statement that the union would not recognise the new constituent assembly due to "concerns over its effective representativeness and legitimacy".

The area was to [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg times]] the former [[County of Tyrol]]. The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] in 1919 divided the area into two parts:
* State of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]; formed by [[North Tyrol|North]] and [[East Tyrol]], it belongs to the [[Republic of Austria]]
* Region of [[Trentino-South Tyrol]]; at that time still with [[Souramont]] ([[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], [[Livinallongo del Col di Lana]] and [[Colle Santa Lucia]]) and the municipalities [[Valvestino]], [[Magasa, Lombardy|Magasa]] and [[Pedemonte]], belonged to the [[Kingdom of Italy]], since 1946 the [[Italy|Italian Republic]].

With the founding of the European region [[Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino Euroregion|Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]] the area has its own legal entity since 2011 in the form of a [[European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation]].

== Etymology ==

According to {{ill|Egon Kühebacher|de}}, the name ''Tyrol'' derives from a root word meaning ''terrain'' (i.e. area, ground or soil; compare {{lang-la|terra}} and [[Old Irish]]: ''tir''); first from the village of [[Tirol, South Tyrol|Tirol]], and its [[Tyrol Castle|castle]]; from which the [[County of Tyrol]] grew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Egon |last=Kühebacher |title=Die Ortsnamen Südtirols und ihre Geschichte.

Gesammelte Aufsätze und Arbeiten |volume=3 |publisher=Wagner |location=Innsbruck |year=1990 |isbn=3-7030-0279-4 |page=1127}}&lt;/ref&gt; There seems to be no scholarly consensus.

==Geography==

===Location===
[[File:Inntal mit Pendling-2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Inn Valley]] with a view of [[Kufstein]]]]
Tyrol has an area of 26,673&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The region consists of the State of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], the Province of [[South Tyrol]] and the [[Trentino|Province of Trento]]. In addition to the region belong the municipalities [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], [[Livinallongo del Col di Lana]], [[Colle Santa Lucia]] and [[Pedemonte]] from the Region of [[Veneto]] and [[Valvestino]] and [[Magasa, Lombardy|Magasa]] from the Region of [[Lombardy]]. The largest cities in Tyrol are [[Innsbruck]], [[Trento]] and [[Bolzano]].

The whole region of Tyrol is located in the [[Alps]]. Tyrol is bordered to the north by the state of [[Bavaria]] and to the east by the states of [[Carinthia]] and [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]]. West of Tyrol lies the state of [[Vorarlberg]] and the canton of [[Grisons]]. On the southern side of Tyrol, the land is bordered by the regions of [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardy]].

Important rivers in Tyrol are the [[Adige]], [[Inn (river)|Inn]] and [[Drau]]. The region is characterized by many valleys. Some of these valleys are still difficult to reach today. The most important valleys are the [[Inn Valley]] and [[Adige Valley]]. A large part of the population lives in these two valleys and also the five largest cities of Tyrol ([[Innsbruck]], [[Bolzano]], [[Trento]], [[Merano]] and [[Rovereto]]) lie in these valleys. For centuries, the region has been known for transit trade. The most important trade route across the Alps, namely the [[Brenner Pass|Brenner Route]], traverses the whole of Tyrol and is regarded as a connecting link between the Italian and [[German speaking area|German]] speaking areas.

===Mountains===
[[File:Ortler Reschensee.JPG|right|200px|thumb|left summit: the [[Gran Zebrù]], right summit: the [[Ortler]]; seen from [[Lake Reschen]]]]
As the Tyrolean region is located in the [[Alps]], the landscape is heavily influenced by the mountains. The highest mountains in Tyrol include:
* the [[Ortler]] 3905 [[Metres above sea level|m a.s.l.]]
* the [[Gran Zebrù]] 3851 m a.s.l.
* the [[Grossglockner]]; 3798 [[Metres above the Adriatic|m AA]]
* the [[Monte Cevedale]]; 3769 m a.s.l.
* the [[Wildspitze]]; 3768 m AA
Across Tyrol, on the border between North and South Tyrol, runs the [[main chain of the Alps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Tirol |first=William Augustus Brevoort |last=Coolidge |volume=26 |page=1010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main chain of the Alps geographically divides the Alps into a southern and northern half.

==Society==
[[File:Language distribution in South Tyrol and Trentino.png|thumb|left|Language distribution in [[Trentino-Alto Adige|Trentino-South Tyrol]].]]
===Language distribution===
Tyrol can be subdivided into 5 different language groups. In addition to the majority languages such as German and Italian, languages such as [[Ladin language|Ladin]], [[Cimbrian language|Cimbrian]] and [[Mócheno language|Mócheno]] are also spoken. The last three languages are recognized as minority languages. These language groups are mostly located in the Trentino-Alto Adige region and are thus promoted and protected by the region.
The Ladin language is also spoken outside the region in [[Souramont]] ([[Province of Belluno]]). Ladin is considered a [[Rhaeto-Romance language]].
The [[Cimbrian language]] is also used in various linguistic islands ([[Sette Comuni]]) outside the region of Trentino-South Tyrol. The Cimbrian language is considered an upper-Bavarian dialect.

====Dialects====
In state of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], the German language is used by a large majority. As in many other regions in German-speaking countries, Tyrol also has its own German-language dialect. The Tyrolean dialect comes from the [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] dialect.
In [[South Tyrol]], the Tyrolean dialect was mixed with a few individual Italian words. Due to the difficult accessibility of the valleys in earlier years, many other valleys developed a slightly differentiated dialect compared to the Tyrolean. The Italian language group in South Tyrol mostly uses the Italian standard language and does not speak any dialect.
The Ladin language also has no uniform language, so every valley also has a slight difference in [[Ladinia]].
The majority in [[Trentino]] speaks its own Italian dialect. This dialect has slightly Venetian features, mixed with words from the German-Bavarian dialect.

==Heraldry==
: ''See {{ill|Coat of arms of Tyrol|de|Tiroler Wappen}}''

Although the details of the arms of Tyrol have changed over the centuries, one feature has remained more-or-less constant: ''[[argent]]'', an [[Eagle (heraldry)#Eagle displayed|eagle displayed]] ''[[gules]]'', armed (and sometimes crowned) ''[[Or (heraldry)|or]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| |title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry |first=A. C. |last=Fox-Davies |authorlink=Arthur Charles Fox-Davies |year=1909 |pages=234-235 |publisher=[[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1983, the Province of [[South Tyrol]] has its own coat of arms. It is very similar to the coat of arms of the State of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]. The Province wanted to emphasize the historical commonality of the countries. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.provinz.bz.it/politik-recht-aussenbeziehungen/autonomie/wappen-banner-symbole-autonomie.asp|title= Wappen und Banner: Symbole der Autonomie|publisher= Province of South Tyrol|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Province of [[Trentino|Trento]] received its coat of arms in 1340 and refers to the [[bishopric of Trent|prince-bishopric of Trento]]. The former [[County of Tyrol]] had a uniform coat of arms, which was slightly changed over the centuries.

==History==
{{seealso|History of Tyrol}}
[[File:Emil Rau - A Summer’s Day in Tyrol.jpg|thumb|Traditional costumes of Tyrol]]
===Prehistory===
{{no references|section|date=July 2017}}
The earliest archaeological records of human settlement in Tyrol have been found in the [[Tischofer Cave]]. They date from the [[Palaeolithic]], about 28,000-27,000 [[years BP|BP]]. The same cave has also yielded evidence of human occupation during the [[Bronze Age]] (very roughly, 4000-3000 BP (2000–1000 BC)).

In 1991, the mummified remains of a man who had died around 3300-3100 BC were discovered in a glacier in the [[Ötztal Alps]], in Tyrol. Researchers have called him [[Ötzi]] (and also other names, including "The Iceman"). He lived during the [[Chalcolithic]] or Copper Age, after man had learned how to exploit copper but before man had learned how to make bronze. His body and belongings were very well-preserved, and have been subjected to detailed scientific study. They are preserved in the [[South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology]], [[Bolzano]], South Tyrol, Italy.

There is evidence that Tyrol was a centre for copper mining in the 4th millennium BC; for example, at [[Brixlegg]]. There is also evidence of the [[Urnfield culture]] (roughly 1300–750 BC).

Evidence of the [[La Tène culture]] (roughly 450–100 BC, during the [[Iron Age]]) has also been found; as has evidence of the [[Fritzens-Sanzeno culture]] from about the same period. Towards the end of that time, Tyrol began to be noted in Roman written records. The inhabitants may have been [[Illyrians]], in the process of being displaced by [[Celts]] (perhaps themselves displaced from [[Noricum]] by [[Slavs]]). There are also indications that [[Adriatic Veneti]] may have been present in the south of the region. The Romans called them [[Rhaetians]]; although it is not clear whether that then meant a specific tribe or confederation of tribes, or was a broader term for the inhabitants of the area. They made wine barrels (an idea which the Romans took from them), and had their own alphabet.

===Roman times===
{{no references|section|date=July 2017}}
In 15 BC, Tyrol was conquered by Roman forces commanded by [[Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus|Drusus]] and [[Tiberius]]. The Romans established [[Raetia]] and [[Noricum]] as [[Roman province|province]]s of the [[Roman Empire]]. Raetia included Vinschgau, Burggrafenamt, Eisacktal, Wipptal, Oberinntal and parts of the Unterinntal. Noricum included Pustertal, Defereggen and parts of the Unterinntal to the right of the Ziller and the Inn. [[Bolzano]] and the extreme south of Tyrol belonged to the province of [[Triveneto|Venetia et Histria]].

The inhabitants adopted [[vulgar Latin]], and combined it with their own languages. The result was [[Romansh language|Romansh]], which is still spoken today and is one of the official languages of Switzerland.

The Romans constructed [[Roman roads|metalled roads]] guarded by [[Roman fort|fort]]s through Tyrol to connect the Italian peninsula and the lands beyond; notably the [[Via Claudia Augusta]] and the {{ill|Via Raetia|de}}. The Romans did not seem to find Tyrol an attractive area in which to build new towns, because there are few of them. One town they did build was [[Aguntum]], near modern [[Lienz]].

In late antiquity (from AD 476), Tyrol belonged to the [[Ostrogoths]], and it was included in the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]]. In 534, the Ostrogoths lost Merrano, Val Venosta and Passer to the [[Franks]]. The Ostrogothic Kingdom collapsed in 553, after being overrun by {{ill|Bajuvarians|de|Bajuwaren}} from the north and [[Lombards]] from the south. The Lombards established the [[Duchy of Tridentum]] (or, Trent; roughly corresponding to modern [[Trentino]]) in south Tyrol. [[Slavic people]]s, who had recently taken [[Carinthia]] from the Bajuvarians, settled in east Tyrol.

===Middle Ages===
{{no references|section|date=July 2017}}
{{main|County of Tyrol}}
Most of Tyrol came under the control of the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] (created {{circa|555}}). The southern parts, including Bolzano, [[Salorno]], and the right bank of the [[Adige]] (including [[Eppan an der Weinstraße|Eppan]] and [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße|Kaltern]]) remained under the Lombards. Tyrol was christianised through the bishoprics of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bolzano-Brixen|Brixen]] and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Trento|Triento]]. The frontier remained the same though [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] times. The area was subject to ''Stammensgerechte'' ([[Ancient Germanic law]]s), such as ''Lex Romana Curiensis'' (see [[Raetia Curiensis]]), ''[[Lex Alamannorum]]'', ''[[Lex Baiuvariorum]]'' and ''[[Leges Langobardorum]]''.

[[File:Am Schloss Tirol.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tyrol Castle]] in [[Tirol, South Tyrol|Tirol]], near [[Merano]].]]
In 1027, Emperor [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], in order to secure the important route through the [[Brenner Pass]], allotted the left bank of the Adige (from [[Lana, South Tyrol|Lana]] to [[Mezzocorona]]) to the Duchy of Bavaria. During the 12th century, the local nobility went further: they built [[Tyrol Castle]] in the modern ''[[comune]]'' of [[Tirol, South Tyrol|Tirol]] in South Tyrol, near modern [[Merano]]; and around 1140, established the [[County of Tyrol]] as a state within the Holy Roman Empire.

The Counts of Tyrol were at first ''[[Vogt]]'' (underlords) subject to the Bishoprics of Brixen and Triento; but they had other ideas. They expanded their holdings at those bishoprics' expense. They displaced competing nobles like the {{ill|House of Eppan|de|Eppan (Adelsgeschlecht)}}, and declared their independence from the Duchy of Bavaria; though not without dispute. In 1228, they conceded the {{ill|Saalforste|de}} to the [[House of Wittelsbach]], rulers of Bavaria; as a result, that area remains part of Bavaria to this day.

In 1253, rulership of the County passed by inheritance to the [[Meinhardiner|Meinhardiner family]]. In 1335, the last male heir to the Meinhardiner lands, [[Henry of Bohemia]], died. His daughter, [[Margaret, Countess of Tyrol|Margaret]], thereupon became Countess of Tyrol; but her title was in doubt because of different laws in different lands as to what a woman could or could not inherit. She navigated her way between the competing claims of the Houses of Wittelsbach, [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] and [[Habsburg]] by, in 1342, marrying [[Louis V, Duke of Bavaria|Louis of Wittelsbach]]. Louis died in 1361. Margaret died in 1369, and bequeathed Tyrol to [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria|Rudolf of Habsburg]]. The various dynastic squabbles were resolved that same year by the {{ill|Treaty of Schärding|de|Frieden von Schärding}}, under which (for suitable compensation) the Wittelsbachs agreed to relinquish their claims to Tyrol in favour of the Habsburgs.

When the Habsburgs took control of Tyrol, it had roughly its modern size. However, the [[Unterinntal]] downstream from [[Schwaz]] still belonged to Bavaria; the [[Zillertal]] and [[Brixental]] to [[Salzburg]]; [[Brixen]] and the [[Pustertal]] were episcopal territories, or part of the [[County of Gorizia]]. Therefore, the [[Montafon]] and the [[Unterengadin]] were Tyrolean.

Tyrol was of great strategic importance to the Habsburgs. It controlled several important Alpine passes. It connected their landholdings in [[Further Austria]]. In 1406, as the Habsburg lands were split up by inheritance, Tyrol once again became a separate entity (a ''[[Landstand]]''), in which the greater landowners had the right to be consulted (''Mitspracherecht''). During a confusing succession of events, in 1420 [[Frederick IV, Duke of Austria]] moved the capital of Tyrol from [[Meran]] to [[Innsbruck]], and Meran lost its earlier importance.

==Politics==
===Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino===
{{main|Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino}}
[[File:Dreier Landtag.jpg|thumb|right|Dreier-Landtag]]
The [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]] was founded in 1998. The aim is to strengthen cooperation between the separated countries. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europaregion.info/de/willkommen.asp|title=Willkommen|publisher=Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino|accessdate=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several areas, such as mobility, agriculture, education and culture will be tried to promote exchange and to raise the awareness of the cultural and historical heritage of the region of Tyrol in the minds of the population. Cross-border projects will be initiated to improve the relationship between the different language groups.
To represent common ideas and values in Europe, the Euroregion has a joint office in [[Brussels]] since 1995. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.europaregion.info/de/europa.asp|title=Europäische Integration und Euregio|publisher=Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino|accessdate=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters of the office is in [[Bolzano]]. Joint decisions are taken by organized three diet (in German: ''Dreier-Landtag''), which have been held since 1991 mostly every two to three years with the [[Landtag|state Diets]] of Trento (provincial council of Trentino), [[Landtag of South Tyrol|Bolzano]] (provincial council of South Tyrol) and Innsbruck (state council of Tyrol (State)). In 2011, the region was institutionalized and since then has its own legal entity.

===Political Parties===
Political parties in the Italian part of Tyrol (provinces of Bolzano and Trento) include:
* [[Partito Democratico]] (PD)
* [[Südtiroler Volkspartei]] (SVP)
* [[Movimento 5 Stelle|Movimento Cinque Stelle]] (M5S)
* [[Lega Nord]] (LN)
* [[Greens (South Tyrol)|Greens]]
* [[South Tyrolean Freedom]]
* [[Die Freiheitlichen]]
* [[Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party]] (PATT)

The Austrian part of Tyrol shares the Austrian party system:
* [[Tiroler Volkspartei]]; organization of the [[ÖVP]] in the state of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], which has dominated local politics since 1945
* [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SPÖ)
* [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FPÖ)
* [[The Greens – The Green Alternative]]
* [[NEOS - The New Austria and Liberal Forum|NEOS]]

The multiplicity of parties is due to the fact that Tyrol lies in two different nation states and thus are politically independent of each other. Another reason for the large number of parties is the great independence of the two Provinces of [[South Tyrol|Bolzano]] and [[Trentino|Trento]]. By the second statute of autonomy in 1972, the province of Bolzano acquired much of the region's competences and since then has been mostly independent of the province of Trento. The second autonomy statute enabled the linguistic minorities to be better protected. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.provinz.bz.it/politik-recht-aussenbeziehungen/autonomie/autonomiestatut.asp|title=Das Autonomiestatut|publisher=Province of South Tyrol|accessdate=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[regional council of Trentino-South Tyrol]], which consists of the two provincial councils of Bolzano and Trento, has less influence and competences. Thus, many parties determine their focus within the provinces. Other parties in [[Trentino-South Tyrol]], especially in South Tyrol, were founded on the example of Austrian parties and have many similarities with the [[List of political parties in Austria|parties in Austria]].

==Economy==
In the economic sector statistics are shown, which are based largely on numbers and data of the [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]]. It lacks individual communities that are outside the Euroregion. As there are no 10,000 inhabitants living in these communities, the statistics hardly distort the territory of Tyrol and the remaining 1.8 million inhabitants.

Tyrol had a total GDP of 67.6 billion euros in 2014. Divided into individual countries, the State of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] generated 28.8 billion euros, the Province of [[South Tyrol]] 20.6 billion euros and the Province of [[Trentino]] 18.2 billion euros. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europaregion.info/de/zahlen-europaregion.asp|title=ZAHLEN ZUR EUROPAREGION|publisher=Europaregion Tirol-Südtirol-Trentino|accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In GDP per capita (2015), that means 39,300 euros/capita in the State of Tyrol, 42,400 euros/capita in South Tyrol and 35,500 euros/capita in Trentino. The unemployment rate in the State of Tyrol is 3.2% (2014), in South Tyrol 3.4% (2017) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.suedtirolnews.it/wirtschaft/arbeitslosenquote-in-suedtirol-bei-34-prozent|title=Arbeitlosenquote in Südtirol bei 3,4%|publisher=suedtirolnews.it|accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Trentino 4.6% (2017) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/trentino/notizie/2017/12/07/istat-in-trentino-disoccupazione-in-calo-46_a8bac161-5a47-431a-95ac-9c678cdd00aa.html|title=Istat, Trentino disoccupazione in calo (4,6%)|publisher=ansa.it|accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
The Tyrol region is one of the wealthiest regions in Europe and, in terms of GDP/capita, is above the EU average, which amounted to 28,900 euros/capita in 2015.
The Region of [[Trentino-South Tyrol]] is, in terms of GDP/capita, the wealthiest region in Italy with 37,813 euros/capita in 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7962764/1-30032017-AP-EN.pdf/4e9c09e5-c743-41a5-afc8-eb4aa89913f6|title=2015 GDP per capita in 276 EU regions Four regions over double the EU average… …and still nineteen regions below half of the average|publisher=European Union|accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary sector===
[[File:St-magdalena st-justina-rosengarten.jpg|thumb|right|Vineyards in [[Bolzano]]]]
Agriculture and forestry occupy a special position in Tyrol. The many small and medium-sized farms have shaped the landscape and culture in Tyrol for many centuries. In order to be competitive with larger farms outside Tyrol, there is a strong [[cooperative]] system in Tyrol.
South of Tyrol, in the Region of [[Trentino-South Tyrol]], the cultivation of apples and wine plays an important role. So every tenth apple in Europe comes from [[South Tyrol]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idm-suedtirol.com/de/ueber-suedtirol/1-jeder-10-europaeische-apfel-kommt-aus-suedtirol.html|title=Jeder 10. Apfel europäische Apfel kommt aus Südtirol|publisher=IDM Südtirol|accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known wines in Trentino-South Tyrol are the [[Vernatsch]], the [[Lagrein]], the [[Gewürztraminer]] and the [[Weißburgunder]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.suedtirolwein.com/de/suedtirol-wein.html|title=Südtirol Wein|publisher=Südtirol Wein|accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Livestock, grazing and forestry are important at higher elevations and in more northerly areas. Mainly cattle, sheep, goats and pigs are kept. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tirol.gv.at/fileadmin/themen/statistik-budget/statistik/downloads/Folder_T_ST_T_2015.pdf|title=Zahlen zur Europaregion|publisher=Europaregion Tirol-Südtirol-Trentino|accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the production of milk and [[Tyrolean Speck]] in the farms is very important. Horses also play an increasingly important role in livestock, for equestrian sports and farm holidays. The [[Haflinger]] horses are known in the Tyrolean region and originate from [[Hafling]], near [[Merano]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tt.com/lebensart/freizeit/13610447-91/pferde-in-tirol-das-glück-der-erde-steht-auf-vier-beinen.csp|title=Pferde in Tirol:Das Glück der Erde steht auf vier Beinen|publisher=Tiroler Tageszeitung|accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary sector===
The first industrialization reached Tyrol late in the 19th century. Most of these were small businesses that were important only in the local area. A second wave of industrialization took place at the beginning of the 20th century. Particularly affected at that time was the city of [[Bolzano]] with the [[Italianization]] policy under the fascism in the 20s. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hk-cciaa.bz.it/sites/default/files/uploaded_files/Scuola_economia/20181_materiale_didattico2014_ECONOMIC_HISTORY_de.pdf|title=ECONOMIC HISTORY|publisher=Handelskammer Bozen|accessdate=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, approximately 10% of the workplaces in all parts of the country were active in the manufacturing sector. Thus lies Tyrol in the EU average at 10.3% (2011). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.tirol.gv.at/fileadmin/themen/statistik-budget/statistik/downloads/Folder_T_ST_T_2015.pdf|title=Zahlen zur Europregion|publisher=Bundesland Tirol|accessdate=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important branches of industry in Tyrol are the food industry, wood processing and mechanical engineering.
The industry in Tyrol consists mostly of small and medium-sized companies. The craft still plays a special role throughout the region. A large part of these craft businesses are still partially small-structured and family businesses. From an economic point of view, the energy sector is important in the secondary sector. Much of the electricity produced is generated by [[hydropower]].

===Tertiary sector===
[[File:Riva del Garda , Panorama - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|A known city for tourism: [[Riva del Garda]] on [[Lake Garda]]]]
The most important sector in Tyrol is the tertiary sector. Especially tourism has a special position in this region. Due to the connection of the areas by the railway in the 19th century, many villages in Tyrol developed into popular tourism locations. The construction of the Brenner motorway in the 1960s gave region in the 20th century a renewed upswing in the tourism branch. Today, [[Merano]], [[Kitzbühel]], [[Cortina d'Ampezzo|Cortina]] or [[Riva del Garda]] are among the most important tourism destinations in the Alpine region. In 2013, the [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino|Euroregion]] counted over 80 million &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.tirol.gv.at/fileadmin/themen/statistik-budget/statistik/downloads/Folder_T_ST_T_2015.pdf|title=Zahlen zur Europregion|publisher=Bundesland Tirol|accessdate=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; overnight stays in the Tyrolean region (to compare - [[Province of Rome]] in 2011: 25.8 million overnight stays). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://scenarieconomici.it/dati-provinciali-sul-turismo-deludono-roma-e-firenze-eccellenti-bolzano-venezia-e-rimini/|title=Dati Provinciali sul Turismo: deludono Roma e Firenze, eccellenti Bolzano, Venezia e Rimini.|publisher=scenarieconimici.it|accessdate=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important for Tyrol is the trade. Among other things, the [[Bolzano#Exhibition Bolzano|Exhibition of Bolzano]] has been a meeting point for Italian and German economy already for centuries. As a transit route country, more than 2.25 million trucks (2017) drove over the [[Brenner Pass]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stol.it/Artikel/Wirtschaft/Wirtschaft/Transit-Mehr-als-2-25-Millionen-Lkw-fuhren-2017-ueber-den-Brenner|title=Transit: Mehr als 2,25 Millionen Lkw fuhren 2017 über den Brenner|publisher=stol.it|accessdate=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; . This means that two times more trucks travel on the Brenner Route than in all four Alpine crossing roads in Switzerland together. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tirol.orf.at/news/stories/2682236/|title= Mehr Transit-Lkws über den Brenner als in Schweiz|publisher=tirol.orf.at|accessdate=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
Tyrol is known as a transit route. The most important route between northern and southern Europe, the Brenner route, traverses the entire region. At 1370 m above the Adriatic, the [[Brenner Pass]] is the lowest pass crossing of the [[main chain of the Alps]].
Due to the linguistic diversity and the climatic transition from [[temperate climate]] ([[alpine climate]]) to [[mediterranean climate]], the area is regarded as a bridge between the Italian and German speaking countries.

===Airports===
[[File:Flughafen Innsbruck - 12-06-05 by ralfr.jpg|thumb|right|[[Innsbruck Airport]]]]
The most important airport in Tyrol is [[Innsbruck Airport]]. With over one million passengers, it is the third largest airport in Austria. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flugladen.at/flughafen/innsbruck|title=Flughafen Innsbruck|publisher=flugladen.at|accessdate=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other airports in the region are in [[Bolzano Airport|Bolzano]] and [[Trento Airport|Trento]]. These do not offer regular scheduled flights and the [[Bolzano Airport]] currently offers charter flights. There are other small airfields in [[Toblach]], [[Kufstein]], [[St. Johann in Tirol]], [[Reutte]] and [[Cortina d'Ampezzo|Cortina]]. The airfield in Cortina was closed in 1976 due to a crash.

===Road transport===
Highways in Tyrol are the Brenner motorway and the Inntal motorway. The Brenner motorway runs from [[Innsbruck]] (in Austria [[Brenner Autobahn|A13]]) to Modena (in Italy [[Autostrada A22 (Italy)|A22]]). Together with the Inntal motorway from [[Innsbruck]] to [[Kufstein]] is the part of the [[European route E45]]. The dual carriageway from [[Merano]] to [[Bolzano]] (MeBo) ends in Bolzano South in the Brenner motorway. Important road section in [[Trentino]], next to the Brenner motorway, is the SS 47 (Strada Statale 47), which connects via [[Sugana Valley]] [[Trento]] with [[Padova]]. A large part of this route is dual-lane and flows into the Brenner state road (SS 12).
Due to the [[Alps]], there are many [[Mountain pass|mountain passes]] that connect valleys. The most important pass roads for transit trade are the [[Reschen Pass]] and [[Brenner Pass]]. Popular pass roads include the [[Stelvio Pass]], [[Arlberg Pass]], [[Karerpass|Karer Pass]], [[Mendel Pass]] and the [[Gardena Pass]]. The Provinces of [[Trentino|Trento]] and [[South Tyrol|Bolzano]] have been responsible for the preservation and management of the state roads in their provinces since 1998. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.provinz.bz.it/news/de/news.asp?news_action=4&amp;news_article_id=590799|title=ANAS-Immobilien gehen an das Land über – Vertrag nun unterzeichnet|publisher=Provinz Bozen|accessdate=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railways===
[[File:Nuovo Treno Val Pusteria.JPG|thumb|left|Pustertal railway]]
The most important railway line in Tyrol is the Brenner Line via the [[Brenner Pass]]. The [[Brenner Railway]] was opened in 1867 and runs from [[Innsbruck]] to [[Verona]] via the cities of [[Bolzano]] and [[Trento]]. Together with the [[New Lower Inn Valley Railway|Lower Inn Valley Railway]] in [[North Tyrol]], this section of the route is part of the important European railway axis [[Berlin-Palermo railway axis|Berlin-Palermo]], which connects northern Europe with southern Europe across the Alps. With the construction of the [[Brenner Base Tunnel]] and its completion in 2027, transit traffic on the rail will be promoted and relocated. After completion, the [[Brenner Base Tunnel]], together with the [[Innsbruck bypass]], will be the longest railway tunnel in the world at 64 km and will reduce the travel time between [[Bolzano]] and [[Innsbruck]] from 2 hours to 45 minutes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tt.com/politik/landespolitik/13383174-91/tirol-und-südtirol-feierten-150-jahre-brennerbahn-mit-railjet.csp|title=Tirol und Südtirol feierten 150 Jahre Brennerbahn mit Railjet|publisher=Tiroler Tageszeitung|accessdate=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/neuer-brenner-tunnel-mit-tempo-250-durch-die-alpen-13671819.html|title=Mit Tempo 250 durch die Alpen|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine|accessdate=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further important railway lines in Tyrol are the [[Arlberg railway]], [[Zillertal Railway|Zillertal railway]], [[Salzburg-Tyrol Railway|Salzburg-Tyrol railway]], [[Pustertal railway]] with continuation of the [[Drautal railway]], the [[railway line Bolzano-Merano]] and the continuation of the [[Vinschgau railway]], the [[Trento–Malè–Mezzana railway]] and the [[Trento–Venice railway|Valsugana railway]], which leads from [[Trento]] to [[Venice]] over the [[Sugana Valley]]. Cross-border connections are offered only a few. The [[ÖBB]] travels over the Brenner Pass on the [[Eurocity]] trains and several regional trains connect [[South Tyrol]] with [[North|North Tyrol]] an [[East Tyrol]]. The [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]] has set itself the goal of promoting and expanding cross-border connections. The aim is to shift traffic through the Alps to sustainable means of transport, thus protecting the Alpine environment. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europaregion.info/de/mobilitaet-verkehr.asp|title=MOBILITÄT UND VERKEHR|publisher=Europaregion Tirol-Südtirol-Trentino}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local public transport===
Many villages and communities are difficult to reach because of the large differences in altitude, so the region sets much on [[ropeway]] concepts. Although most of the [[Aerial lift|cable cars]] are located in ski resorts, they are also used for the local public transport. Known cable cars in Tyrol are the [[Ritten cable car]] in [[Bolzano]], the [[Sardagna cable car]] in [[Trento]] and the [[Nordkette Cable Car|Nordkette cable car]] in [[Innsbruck]]. Also [[funicular]] railways are being built to cope with the differences in altitude more quickly. Famous funiculars are among others the [[Hungerburgbahn]] in [[Innsbruck]] and the [[Mendel funicular]] in [[Kaltern]].

Local public transport is usually offered with intercity buses or city buses. The city of [[Innsbruck Tramway|Innsbruck]] has its own tram network. Another [[Rittnerbahn|tram]] is located in [[Ritten]]. The cities of [[Bolzano Tramway|Bolzano]], [[Meran Tramway|Merano]] and [[Trento]] formerly had their own tram network, but these were displaced and replaced by the city buses and private transport in the 50s and 60s.

==Culture==
The Tyrolean culture has been cultivated for several centuries and passed on to future generations. The state border between South and North Tyrol is more a political border and is considered less as a cultural border. Many traditions are cultivated throughout the Tyrolean region and show little differences. In all cultural areas such as food, dress or customs there are many similarities. Nevertheless, the individual language groups, especially the minority languages, try to maintain and promote their own linguistic identity.

===Tyrolean cuisine ===
[[File:Südtiroler Speck g.g.A. aufgeschnitten.jpg|thumb|200px|left|South [[Tyrolean Speck]]]]
The [[Austrian cuisine#Tyrol|Tyrolean cuisine]] has similarities with the [[Austrian cuisine]] and is characterized by its alpine influence. Also the historical influence of the former [[K.U.K. Monarchy]] can be found in the Tyrolean dishes. These include dishes such as [[goulash]], [[Kaiserschmarrn]] and [[apple strudel]] which are consumed in large parts of the [[Danube monarchy]] and today still in Tyrol. Since the region is still relatively strong agricultural and peasant today, also many peasant dishes are offered on the farms. [[Schlutzkrapfen]], [[Knödel|boiled dumplings]] or cold cuts with [[Tyrolean Speck|bacon (in German: ''Speck'')]] is eaten on the farms. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.tirol.at/reisefuehrer/kultur-leben/kulinarik|title=Essen und trinken in Tirol|publisher=Tirol Marketing|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tyrolean dishes show only slight differences throughout Tyrol. Due to the Mediterranean conditions in the southern part of Tyrol, a lot of wine is grown and is therefore also an important part of the Tyrolean dish, especially in [[South Tyrol]] and [[Trentino]]. Famous wines from this area are the [[Gewürztraminer]], [[Pinot Blanc]], [[Pinot Grigio]] and [[Chardonnay]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.suedtirolwein.com/de/suedtirol-wein.html|title=Südtirol Wein|publisher=Südtirol Wein|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a lot of apples are grown in the Region of [[Trentino-South Tyrol]]. In this region also a food culture is cultivated with a mixture of Italian and Tyrolean specialties. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.suedtirol.info/de/erleben/essen-trinken|title=Essen und trinken in Südtirol|publisher=IDM Südtirol|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.trentino.com/de/freizeit-aktiv/essen-trinken/|title=Essen und trinken|publisher=trentino.com|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tyrolean Rifles ===
[[File:Schützenkompaniecastelam.jpg|thumb|right|Trentino Rifle Company in front of [[Castle of Castellano]]]]
The Tyrolean Rifles were a militia organised in case of an attack on [[Crown land (Austria)|crown land]], which required Tyrol to defend its territory. The militia consisted mostly of citizens and peasants who were responsible only for the defence of their own land and were not obliged to go to war on behalf of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. They were authorised by an order signed by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian I]] in 1511 that remained valid until 1918. The Tyrolean Rifles became known in [[Tyrolean Rebellion|1809]] when Tyrolese peasants rose up and fought against the French-Bavarian occupation under [[Napoleon]]. The ensuing four [[Battles of Bergisel]] were led by [[Andreas Hofer]]. The Rifles were also used in [[World War I]] in 1915 on the [[Dolomite front]].
After the separation of Tyrol and the downfall of the monarchy, the companies also lost their task of defending their country. Nevertheless, they remained as a non-governmental organization.
Today, the Rifles are responsible as an organization for the preservation of the Tyrolean culture and are always present at important political events in Tyrol. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://schuetzen.com/organisation/ssb/ueber-uns/|title=Über uns|publisher=Südtiroler Schützenbund|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customs===
Many Tyrolean customs were created centuries ago and are passed on by the population for the next generations. Typical in the Alpine region are the many individual customs in the valleys. Due to the seclusion of the valleys, the locals developed their own customs. Many customs have been created by legends and narratives, others by the close connection to the church. There are also traditions that are cultivated everywhere in the Tyrolean region and do not differ from other valleys and villages. These customs give local people an identity and thus feel the community more connected. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tirol.at/reisefuehrer/kultur-leben/brauchtum|title=Brauchtum|publisher=Tirol Marketing|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
Tyrol is traditionally a winter sports country. Many athletes, such as [[Gustav Thoeni]], [[Benjamin Raich]], [[Carolina Kostner]], [[Gregor Schlierenzauer]], [[Toni Sailer]] and [[Armin Zoeggeler]] have already won overall World Cups and medals at World Championships and Olympic Games.
Even in summer sports, several athletes from Tyrol were and still are among the best in the world. In water jumping [[Tania Cagnotto]] and [[Klaus Dibiasi]] won several medals. In cycling, [[Francesco Moser]] won the [[Giro d'Italia]]. [[Andreas Seppi]] played against the best tennis players in the world for many years. In [[bouldering]] [[Anna Stöhr]] was one of the best in the world.
Many Tyrolean mountaineers such as [[Reinhold Messner]] and [[Hans Kammerlander]] influenced the [[alpinism]].

===Soccer===
The [[FC Wacker Innsbruck (2002)|FC Wacker Innsbruck]] is one of the most traditional and successful clubs in Austria. Since the club was founded in 1915 and several name changes, the football club has won ten times the Austrian Championship and seven times the Austrian Cup. In 1987, it reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA CUP]]. In 1970, the team defeated Real Madrid in Madrid. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fc-wacker-innsbruck.at/2-uncategorised/1400-erfolge.html|title=Erfolge|publisher=FC Wacker Innsbruck|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently (2018) Wacker Innsbruck plays in the "[[Austrian Football First League|Erste Liga]]" (second highest category of Austria).

In the Region of [[Trentino-South Tyrol]], the [[FC Südtirol]] and [[A.C. Trento S.C.S.D.|AC Trento]] are the two most important clubs. Both teams participated in the Italian [[Serie C]] (third highest league in Italy) for several seasons. The AC Trento has a long history until 1921. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.actrento.com/storia/|title=storia|publisher=AC Trento|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; FC Südtirol was founded in 1995. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fc-suedtirol.com/de/fc-südtirol/geschichte/4-0.html|title=Geschichte|publisher=FC Südtirol|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; AC Trento are currently (2018) playing in the Italian [[Serie D]] (fourth highest league in Italy) and FC Südtirol in [[Serie C]]. Thus, the FC Südtirol is the only professional football club in the region.

Ice hockey is a very popular sport in Tyrol. Important clubs are the [[HC Bolzano]] and the [[HC Innsbruck]]. Both teams play in the [[EBEL]]. The HC Innsbruck, formerly [[EV Innsbruck]], won the Austrian championship seven times. With 19 won Italian championships, the HC Bolzano is the record champion in Italy. The club celebrated the biggest international successes by winning the [[Alpenliga]], the [[EBEL]] and the [[Six Nations Tournament (ice hockey)|Six Nations Tournament]]  with [[Jaromír Jágr]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hcb.net/de/verein/hall-of-fame-2/|title=Hall of fame|publisher=HC Bozen|accessdate=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian ice hockey league consists mostly of South Tyrolean teams. 5 of the 8 Italian teams in the [[Alps Hockey League]] come from South Tyrol ([[HC Neumarkt-Egna]], [[HC Pustertal]], [[Ritten Sport]], [[HC Gardena]] and [[WSV Sterzing Broncos]]). In this league three more Tyrolean teams play ([[SG Cortina]], [[HC Fassa]] and [[EC Kitzbühel]]).

In 2005, the [[2005 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|Ice Hockey World Championship]] was held in [[Innsbruck]] and Vienna. The [[1994 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|1994 Ice Hockey World Championship]] took place in [[Bolzano]], [[Canazei]] and Milan.

===Volleyball===
In volleyball, [[Trentino Volley]] is one of the best teams in the world. Three times the [[CEV Champions League|Champions league]] title, four times the club [[FIVB Volleyball Men's Club World Championship|world championship]] title and four times the [[Italian Volleyball League|Italian championship]] title could win the club from [[Trento]]. Founded in 2000, the club quickly established itself at the top of the league. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trentinovolley.it/pagine/dettaglio/la_societa,2/societa,5.html|title=Società|publisher=Trentino Volley|accessdate=2018-01-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205190548/http://www.trentinovolley.it/pagine/dettaglio/la_societa,2/societa,5.html|archivedate=2018-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Trentino Volley]] won the [[2010–11 CEV Champions League|CEV Champions League]] ahead of its own fans at the [[PalaOnda]] in [[Bolzano]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trentinovolley.it/news/notizie/8211-articolop-finale.html|title=Anche il Kazan si arrende, Trentino BetClic Campione d'Europa per la terza volta consecutiva!|publisher=Trentino Volley|accessdate=2018-01-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123021329/http://www.trentinovolley.it/news/notizie/8211-articolop-finale.html|archivedate=2011-11-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports events===
[[File:Zielgelände Kitzbühel.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Alpine Skiing World Cup in [[Kitzbühel]]]]
In Tyrol, the [[Olympic Winter Games]] have been organized three times so far. In [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]] and [[1976 Winter Olympics|1976]] they were held in [[Innsbruck]] and [[1956 Winter Olympics|1956]] in [[Cortina d’Ampezzo|Cortina]].
Most of the big annual sporting events in Tyrol take place in winter. The [[Alpine Skiing World Cup]] is held in [[Kitzbühel]], [[Val Gardena]], [[Cortina d'Ampezzo|Cortina]] and [[Madonna di Campiglio]]. These races are classics in the Ski World Cup and have a long tradition.
A famous [[biathlon]] location is in [[Antholz]]. There were often held the Biathlon World Championships. Several [[Nordic Combined]] World Championships were organized in [[Val di Fiemme]]. Part of the [[Four Hills Tournament]] is the [[Bergisel Ski Jump]] in Innsbruck. A stage of the [[Tour de Ski]] is also located in [[Toblach]].

Some summer sports events are also held in Tyrol. The [[Tour of the Alps]] take place every year in Tyrol. The tour was launched by the [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]]. It is the successor of the [[Giro del Trentino]], which has been around for over 40 years. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europaregion.info/de/euregio-tour-of-the-alps.asp|title=TOTA – TOUR OF THE ALPS DER EUREGIO|publisher=Europaregion Tirol-Südtirol-Trentino|accessdate=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the UCI [[Downhill mountain biking|Downhill]] World Championships took place in [[Val di Sole]], near [[Trento]].

[[File:Ice Age glacial lakes of Siberia and Central Asia - ru.svg|thumb|Ice Age lakes of Siberia and Central Asia]]
The '''West Siberian Glacial Lake''', also known as '''West Siberian Lake''' or '''Mansiyskoe Lake''' ({{lang-ru|Мансийское озеро}}), was a [[periglacial lake]] formed when the [[Arctic Ocean]] outlets for each of the [[Ob River|Ob]] and [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]] rivers were blocked by the [[Barents-Kara Ice Sheet]] during the [[Weichselian Glaciation]], approximately 80,000 years ago. It was situated on the [[West Siberian Plain]], and at its maximum extent the lake's surface area was more than 750,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which is more than twice that of the present-day [[Caspian Sea]].

It is theorized that although drainage to the Arctic Ocean basin (e.g. by the Ob and Yenisei Rivers) was prevented, the lake would eventually overflow to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] through a circuitous route that would include the [[Aral Sea]], the [[Caspian Sea]], and the [[Black Sea]]. This would have resulted in water from the [[Selenga River]] and [[Lake Baikal]] draining over a course of some {{convert|6000|mi|km|disp=flip}}, considerably longer than any river's course today.&lt;ref&gt;Dutch, Steve, Professor of Natural and Applied Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.
