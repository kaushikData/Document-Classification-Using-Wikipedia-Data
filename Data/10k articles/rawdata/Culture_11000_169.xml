'''Amjad Jaimoukha''' ([[Circassian language|Circassian]]: Жэмыхъуэ Амджэд, {{IPA-all|ʒaməχʷa aːmd͡ʒad|}}; sometimes quoted as "Амыщ", the Circassian personal name)&lt;ref&gt;In Circassian onomastic traditions the family name antecedes the personal name.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a number of books on [[North Caucasus|North Caucasian]] – specifically [[Circassians|Circassian]] and [[Chechen people|Chechen]] – culture and folklore. According to the ''Circassian Encyclopaedia'' "Jaimoukha is perhaps the most important writer on Circassian issues".&lt;ref&gt;Mamser, M., 2009, entry "Amjad Jaimoukha." In: ''The Circassian Encyclopaedia.''&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered one of the most influential Circassian writers and publicists in the last decade. In particular, he was active in promoting and assisting a new crop of Circassian and non-Circassian writers working on raising the profile of Caucasian issues at the global level.

==Principal works==
*''The Circassians: A Handbook'' (London and New York: Routledge; New York: Palgrave, 2001):&lt;ref&gt;This is the first modern account of the Circassians... The book...fills a substantial gap in Western readers' knowledge of this Caucasian nation. It encompasses nearly all aspects of Circassian history and life..." [https://www.jstor.org/pss/4145918]&lt;/ref&gt; It has become the prime reference work on the Circassians. It has been reviewed in more than a dozen international journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jaimoukha.synthasite.com/circassians-handbook.php | title=Circassians Handbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Choice Magazine'' "This exceptionally comprehensive handbook maintains throughout the highest scholarly rigor...a fundamental reference..."&lt;/ref&gt;"
*''The Chechens: A Handbook'' (Routledge, 2005) with contributions from the Canadian writer and poet [[JonArno Lawson]]. The book sheds light on some obscure aspects of Chechen culture and folklore, and includes an account of the ancient native religion and beliefs of the Nakh peoples (Chechens, Ingush, Kist, and Batsbi [Tsova-Tush]). According to the publishers it is "the only comprehensive treatment of this subject available in English".
*''Kabardian-English Dictionary'', Sanjalay Press, 1997. (Some 22,000 words, 574 pages. Principally based on: Kardanov (Qarden), B. M. (ed.), КЪЭБЭРДЕЙ-УРЫС СЛОВАРЬ. Kabardinsko-russki slovar’ [Kabardian-Russian Dictionary], Kabardino-Balkarian Science and Research Institute, Moscow: State Press of Foreign and National Dictionaries, 1957.
*''Parlons tcherkesse: Dialecte kabarde'' [Let's Speak Circassian: Kabardian Dialect], (Paris: L'Harmattan, 2009) Co-authored with Michel Malherbe. This book is the only treatment of the Kabardian dialect of Circassian in the French language.
*''Circassian Culture and Folklore: Hospitality Traditions, Cuisine, Festivals &amp; Music (Kabardian, Cherkess, Adigean, Shapsugh &amp; Diaspora)'', London: Bennett and Bloom, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"This is the first book in English to describe in detail the rich culture and traditions of the Circassians." — From the publisher. "... Together they [this book and ''The Circassians: A Handbook''] provide English-language scholars with a solid basis for the study of the Circassians... [This is an] extremely useful book... Highly recommended..." — B.K. Beynen, CHOICE: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries, v.48, no.11, 2011 July, p.&amp;nbsp;2145(1); [http://chengfind.wpunj.edu/vufind/Record/423201/Reviews#tabnav]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaimoukha published with the following Western publishing houses: Routledge [RoutledgeCurzon], Curzon, Bennett and Bloom, Palgrave (Macmillan) [St. Martin's Press], L'Harmattan. He also worked with Sanjalay Press and the International Centre for Circassian Studies.

==International Centre for Circassian Studies (ICCS)==
Jaimoukha was director of the International Centre for Circassian Studies (ICCS), an institute specialising in the dissemination of Circassian culture and folklore. The Centre is the brainchild of the famous Circassian writer and film producer and director [[Mohydeen Izzat Quandour|Mohydeen Quandour]].  The principal aim of the Centre is the development and dissemination of Circassian literature, culture and folklore. There is a particular emphasis on boosting the status of Circassian and to promote its teaching and use. The Centre publishes a bilingual journal (in Circassian and English) "The Hearth Tree". The publications of the Centre can be accessed via its website [http://iccs.synthasite.com].

Jaimoukha devised a Latin orthography for Kabardian (Eastern Circassian)[http://jaimoukha.synthasite.com/latinized-kabardian-alphabet.php] that is characterised by relative simplicity (considering the complexity of the language). An advantage of this system is that it has a one-to-one correspondence with the current Cyrillic orthography used for Kabardian, and already a software has been designed to render one orthography into the other, making it possible to turn works already published in Cyrillic Kabardian into the new orthography, and vice versa, facilitating transition from one system to the other.

== Work at the Royal Scientific Society ==
Jaimoukha previously held the position of Assistant President of the Royal Scientific Society (RSS) in the period 2003-2007. He published a number of studies and bibliographic tomes during his tenure at RSS, including ''Scientific Integrity'', ''Intellectual Capital Report'', and ''Bibliography of the Publications of the Royal Scientific Society''.

==Circassian culture and folklore==
Jaimoukha was a strong advocate of the revival of all aspects of Circassian culture and folklore, including obsolete and defunct genres of art and culture. He wrote a number of books and articles in journals and newspapers championing the raising of the status of the Circassian language in both the Circassian republics in the Northwest Caucasus (where about one million Circassians live) and in the diaspora (principally in Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, US, Germany, France, and the Netherlands), where some 5 million descendants of the 19th-century Circassian forced immigrants reside. The ultimate survival of the Circassian language and culture is intimately associated with the political fate of the Circassians in the Caucasus and the re-establishment of Circassia as a viable state, recognised as a full member of the comity of nations. The unification of the Kabardians, Cherkess, Adigeans, and Shapsugh in the Northwest Caucasus in the political and cultural spheres is a requisite step towards enhanced autonomy. Jaimoukha was among the vocal Circassians actively engaged in raising awareness of Circassian issues amongst the Circassians themselves and at a global level. He planned to publish a book on the controversial issue of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, to be held in Circassia.

Jaimoukha was a proponent of North Caucasian unity and independence (from Daghestan in the east to Abkhazia in the west). He advocated Circassian independence on a number of media outlets. He referred to the historical lands of the Circassians as "Circassia". Despite the linguistic diversity, the peoples of the North Caucasus share similar traditions, beliefs and culture. His work [http://www.reocities.com/Eureka/Enterprises/2493/norcaucfeder.htm "Thoughts on North Caucasian Federation"] maps a plan of unification of the western part of the region (the historical lands of the Circassians (Adiga), Abkhaz-Abaza [Apswa] and the Ubykh). According to this scheme, the Adiga entities (perhaps with the inclusion of the Abaza) would be united into one independent state that might eventually opt to enter into federative arrangements with the already independent Abkhaz and the Karachai-Balkar state. This would remove the artificial tensions that might flare up into open conflict between the Kabardians and Balkar in Kabardino-Balkaria and the Karachai and Cherkess in the Karachay–Cherkess Republic. The Adigeans would become more secure and more resistant to the Russian drive to undo their fragile republic. It would seem that the logical (interim) step of uniting the Kabardians and Cherkess into one autonomous entity on the one hand and the Karachai and Balkar into another, on the other, is considered taboo by the authorities in the two republics.

==Collaborations==
Principal literary collaborations included work with [[Nick Awde|Nicholas Awde]], the editor of the Caucasus World series published by Routledge and co-owner of the publishing house Bennett and Bloom, JonArno Lawson, the writer of a number of fantastic books, and Michel Malherbe, the prolific writer and editor of the ''Parlons...'' series published by the French publishing house L'Harmattan. A work on the Adigean dialect of Circassian was scheduled to be published by L'Harmattan in 2010. Jaimoukha [http://www.routledge-ny.com/ref/minorities/contributors.html#j] contributed five articles (on the Circassians, Kabardians, Karachai, Dagestanis, and Jordan) in Carl Skutsche's seminal three-volume work ''Encyclopedia of the World's Minorities'' [http://www.routledge-ny.com/ref/minorities/index.html#details] [http://www.routledge-ny.com/ref/minorities/reviews.html], published by Routledge [http://www.routledge.com/] in 2004 in New York.

There was a close co-operation with the Circassian writer Luba Belaghi (Balagova; publications in Circassian and Russian) in the framework of the publications of the International Centre for Circassian Studies.

'''Architectural mythology''' means the [[symbol]]ism of real-world [[architecture]], as well as architecture described in [[mythology|mythological]] stories.&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Lethaby, 1892&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to language a myth could be represented by a painting, a sculpture or a building.

It is about the overall story of an [[architecture|architectural]] work, often revealed through art.  Not all stories surrounding an architectural work incorporate a level of [[mythology|myth]]. These stories can also be well hidden to the casual viewer and are often built into the conceptual design of the architectural statement.

== Ancient greek architecture ==
[[File:Parthenon frieze w facade in situ.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Parthenon Frieze]]]]
Before 600 BC worship was done in the open. But when the Greeks began to represent their Gods by large statues, it was necessary to provide a building for this purpose. This led to the development of temples.&lt;ref name= Strong2&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greek temple|ancient Greek temples]] were often enhanced with mythological decorations from the columns to the roof. The architectural functions of the temple mainly concentrated on the cella with the cult statue. The architectural elaboration served to stress the dignity of the cella.

[[Article (publishing)|News stories]] and features, whether in magazine writing or broadcast news, can be categorized in terms of '''article structures''' that define the order in which information is introduced to the story.  Some writers deny consciously organizing articles according to specific structures, but may use them to describe the writing ''post hoc''.  Others recognize a style within a developing story and use it to develop the narrative.  Still others may be required to pursue a specific style from the beginning by publisher guidelines.&lt;ref name=Saleh&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KypNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166|title=The complete guide to article writing|author=Naveed Saleh|publisher=F+W Media|date=14 January 2014}}  The relevant portion also appears as "Crafting a strong feature article" in Writer's Digest, November/December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structures ==
Some of the structure types include:

=== Inverted pyramid ===
The [[inverted pyramid (journalism)|inverted pyramid]] structure begins with the latest or most important developments, then provides greater description and detail, tapering off with less significant events of relevance.  Proponents of this structure, which is common in news reporting, may criticize other styles as "burying the lead," though others criticize it as a dull style that "tells the joke by starting at the punch line."&lt;ref name=Wenger /&gt; Because this structure is designed to permit truncation by an editor, authors do not need to plan a specific ending as they might with other styles.&lt;ref name=state&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/publication/2008/04/20080416214312eaifas0.7373773.html|title=Telling the story|date=11 April 2008|publisher=U.S. Department of State Handbook of Independent Journalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narrative ===
A narrative structure is a straightforward, [[Chronological order|chronological description]] of events.  For example, an article about a set of [[Murder]]s may begin with the discovery of the first victim and end with the imprisonment or execution of a suspect.&lt;ref name=Saleh /&gt;

=== Hourglass ===
The [[hourglass]] structure is a combination of inverted pyramid and narrative structures.  The author begins with key details ([[Five Ws|who, what, when, where, and why]]), and adds details of increasingly lower importance as in the inverted pyramid structure.  The story then abruptly "turns," requiring a clear transition,&lt;ref name=state /&gt; to focus on a narrative, such as the story of a specific eyewitness or party, which addresses finer details and implications, before making its final conclusion.&lt;ref name=Saleh /&gt; Like the inverted pyramid, it attempts to satisfy readers who don't complete the article, while continuing to engage readers with greater interest.&lt;ref name=Saleh /&gt; In broadcast news reporting, the narrative portion may be provided by a reporter on the scene, while the beginning and end are told by an [[News presenter|anchor]] at the studio.  The simple narrative portion may be convenient for reporters writing under a deadline.&lt;ref name=Wenger /&gt;

=== Nut-graph ===
An article may begin with an anecdotal "[[Attention seeking|hook]]" to catch the reader's attention.  This is followed by a "[[nut graph]]" paragraph that summarizes the story as a whole.  Body paragraphs then explore these ideas in greater detail, provide useful background, or explain conflicting opinions.&lt;ref name=Saleh /&gt;

=== Diamond ===
The diamond structure is similar to a nut graph, with anecdotal hook, nut graph, and a wealth of general detail, but then progressively narrows these issues and applies them to the anecdote introduced in the hook.  The story may be considered as a "quest" to understand the situation of a single individual.&lt;ref name=Saleh /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wenger /&gt; A [[Journalism school|journalism class]] may require this structure for an opinion story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plainlocal.org/userfiles/626/Classes/1130/review%20story%20rubric.pdf|title=Journalism writing rubrics:  opinion story rubric|publisher=Plain Local Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christmas tree ===
The "Christmas tree" shape of this story broadens out from the introduction and a series of internal turning points or surprises within the narrative, before coming to a final conclusion.  For example, the subject may be revealed to (a)HIV, (b) be unresponsive to existing drugs, (c) learn of an experimental study, but (d) doesn't know if it will work.  Each of these turning points provides the basis for further development of the story.&lt;ref name=Wenger&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YBpiCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126|title=Advancing the story: journalism in a multimedia world|author=Debora Halpern Wenger|publisher=CQ Press|date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organic ===
The organic structure, as expounded by [[Jon Franklin]], is composed at its most basic level of visual imagery that provides a [[Cinematic techniques|cinematic]] feel.  These are linked into "foci" that detail an action, which are in turn linked by "transitions in time, mood, subject and character."  A typical sequence of foci may be complication, development, and resolution.&lt;ref name=Saleh /&gt;&lt;!--- editor's note:  Honestly I don't know WTF I'm talking about for this one, except it's roughly what the source says.  Hopefully I'll be able to change that and remove this little note ---&gt;

=== Five-boxes ===
Credited to [[Rick Bragg]], the "five boxes" of this structure are a standard progression: A hook that attracts the reader's attention with a specific image or detail; a nut graph summary; a second lead that introduces remaining facts; details of secondary importance; and a "kicker:" a strong image, comment, or quotation that provides a strong conclusion.&lt;ref name=Saleh /&gt;

'''''Battlefield 4''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[video game developer]] [[EA DICE]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. It is a sequel to 2011's ''[[Battlefield 3]]'' and was released in October 2013 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]]; then later in November for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]].

''Battlefield 4'' was met with positive reception. It was praised for its multiplayer mode, gameplay and graphics, but was also criticized for its short and shallow [[Single-player video game|single-player]] campaign mode, and for its numerous [[Software bug|bugs]] and [[glitch]]es. It was a commercial success, selling over 7 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bfcentral.net/bf4/2014/05/battlefield-4-sells-7-million-2-still-playing/|title=Battlefield 4 sells 7+ million, only 2% are still playing|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Gameplay==
The game's [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]] (HUD) is composed of two compact rectangles. The lower left-hand corner features a mini-map and compass for navigation, and a simplified objective notice above it; the lower right includes a compact ammo counter and health meter. The top right displays kill notifications of all players in-game. On the Windows version of the game, the top left features a chat window when in multiplayer. The mini-map, as well as the main game screen, shows symbols denoting three kinds of entities: blue for allies, green for squadmates, and orange for enemies, this applies to all interactivity on the battlefield. Battlefield 4 options also allow colour-blind players to change the on-screen colour indicators to: tritanomaly, deuteranomaly and protanomaly.

Weapon customisation is expansive and encouraged. Primary, secondary and melee weapons can all be customised with weapon attachments and camouflage 'skins'. Most weapons also have a default setting for different firing modes (e.g. semi-automatic, automatic fire), allowing the player to adapt to the environment they find themselves in. They can "spot" targets (marking their positions to the player's team) in the single-player campaign (a first in the Battlefield franchise) as well as in multiplayer. The game's bullet-dropping-system has been significantly enhanced, forcing the player to change the way they play medium to long distance combat. In addition, players have more combat capabilities, such as countering melee attacks from the front while standing or crouching, shooting with their sidearm while swimming, and diving underwater to avoid enemy detection. Standard combat abilities are still current including, reloading whilst sprinting, unlimited sprint, prone and vaulting.

===Campaign===
The single-player campaign has several differences from the main multiplayer component. For the most part, the player must traverse mini-sandbox-style levels, in some cases using vehicles, like tanks and boats, to traverse the environment. As the player character, [[#Setting and characters|Recker]], the player can use two campaign-only functions: the Engage command and the tactical binocular. The Engage command directs Recker's squadmates, and occasionally other friendly units, to attack any hostiles in Recker's line of sight. The tactical binocular is similar to a laser-designator, in the sense that it allows the player to identify friendly and enemy units, weapon stashes, explosives, and objectives in the field. By identifying enemies, the player can make them visible without using the visor, making them easier to mark for their teammates. At one point, Recker will briefly lose the tactical visor, forcing them to only use the Engage command to direct his squadmates on a limited number of enemies.&lt;ref name=trailer_gameplay_rev /&gt;&lt;ref name=gi_18things /&gt;

The campaign features assignments that require specific actions and unlock weapons for use in multiplayer upon completion. Collectible weapons return along with the introduction of collectible [[dog tag]]s which can be used in multiplayer. Weapon crates are found throughout all levels, allowing players to obtain ammo and switch weapons. While crates hold default weapons, collectible weapons may be used whenever they are acquired and level-specific weapons may be used once a specific mission assignment has been completed by obtaining enough points in a level.&lt;ref name=trailer_gameplay_rev /&gt;&lt;ref name=gi_18things /&gt;

===Multiplayer===
[[File:Battlefield 4 - MP - Commander Mode.jpg|300px|thumb|left|The new Commander Mode interface in ''Battlefield 4'', showing an overhead view of the map "Siege of Shanghai"]]
''Battlefield 4''{{'}}s multiplayer contains three playable factions—the United States, China, and Russia—fighting against each other, in up to 64-player matches on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One (24-Player on Xbox 360 and PS3). A newly reintroduced "Commander Mode", last seen in ''[[Battlefield 2142]]'', gives one player on each team a [[real-time strategy]]-like view of the entire map and the ability to give orders to teammates. Also, the Commander can observe the battle through the eyes of the players on the battlefield, deploying vehicle and weapon drops to "keep the war machinery going", and order in missile strikes on hostile targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-15-battlefield-4-promo-material-reveals-return-of-commander-mode-three-playable-factions |title= Battlefield 4 promo material reveals return of Commander Mode, three playable factions |date= April 15, 2013 |accessdate= May 7, 2013 |first= Wesley |last= Yin-Poole |publisher= Euro Gamer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZTeVnM5Sw |title=Battlefield 4: Official Commander Mode Trailer |publisher=[[Electronic Arts]] |date=June 10, 2013 |accessdate=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spectator mode is included, enabling players to spectate others in first or third person, as well as use a free camera to pan around the map from any angle.

On June 10, 2013, at E3, DICE featured the map "Siege of Shanghai", pitting the [[People's Liberation Army]] against the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]]. The gameplay showcased Commander Mode; new weapons and vehicles; and the "Levolution" gameplay mechanic. The video displays the last of these at various points, including: a player destroying a support pillar to trap an enemy tank above it; and a large skyscraper (with an in-game objective on the top floor) collapsing in the center of the map, kicking up a massive dust cloud throughout the map and bringing the objective closer to ground level.&lt;ref name=bf4_levolution_trailer&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3W4FbsAqIY |title=Battlefield 4: Official Levolution Features Video|publisher=DICE|work=[[YouTube]]|date= |accessdate=August 22, 2013|quote='''Aleksander Grøndal''': Levolution is the next step in player choice, in how you affect the world, and the world affects you back. It can be anything, [like] creating all new paths to get the upper hand in a fight. Raise bollards to stop vehicles, fortify your position by activating the shutter gates. Or how about trapping [an] enemy with one of your hand grenades?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trailer_e3_mp /&gt; Levolution also includes effects such as shooting a fire extinguisher to fill the room with obscuring clouds, car alarms going off when stepped on, metal detectors going off once passed through, or cutting the power in a room to reduce others' visibility.&lt;ref name=bf4_levolution_trailer /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ask-Dice-levolution" /&gt;

The maps included in the main game are "Siege of Shanghai", "Paracel Storm", "Zavod 311", "Lancang Dam", "Flood Zone", "Rogue Transmission", "Hainan Resort", "Dawnbreaker", "Operation Locker" and "Golmud Railway".&lt;ref name="Battle 4 Maps" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pcgamer.com" /&gt; The game modes on offer include ''Battlefield''{{'}}s Conquest, Domination and Rush; while adding two new game modes called Obliteration and Defuse, along with traditional game modes such as Team Deathmatch and Squad Deathmatch.&lt;ref name="pcgamer.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blogs.battlefield.com"/&gt;

The four kits from ''Battlefield 3'' are present in ''Battlefield 4'' with minor tweaks. The Assault kit must now wait for the defibrillator to recharge after reviving teammates in quick succession. The Engineer kit uses [[Personal defense weapon|PDWs]], and carbines are available to all kits. The support kit has access to the new remote mortar and the [[XM25 CDTE|XM25]] allowing for indirect suppressive fire. The Recon kit is now more mobile and is able to equip carbines, [[designated marksman rifle]]s (DMRs), and C4. Sniping mechanics also give with the ability to zero in your sights (set an aiming distance), and equip more optics and accessories than previous Battlefield games. The Recon kit is still able to utilize the MAV, T-UGS, and the Radio Beacon.&lt;ref name="GameSpot-YouTube" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EA-YouTube" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7l-eUmhEW8 |title=Battlefield 4 Multiplayer Demo - Siege of Shanghai E3 2013 |publisher=YouTube |date=June 10, 2013 |accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.battlefield.com/2013/08/road-to-bf4-field-upgrades/|title=The Road to Battlefield 4: Tweaked to the Core}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New vehicles have also been introduced. With the addition of the Chinese faction, new vehicles include the [[Type 99 tank|Type 99 MBT]], the [[ZFB-05]] armored car, and the [[CAIC Z-10|Z-10W attack helicopter]]. Jets have also been rebalanced and put into two classes, "attack" and "stealth". The attack jets focus is mainly air-to-ground capabilities, while stealth jets focus mainly on air-to-air combat. Another vehicle added in ''Battlefield 4'' is the addition of the [[CB90|RCB]] and DV-15 Interceptor attack boats, which function as heavily armed aquatic assault craft.

Customization options have also been increased in ''Battlefield 4'', with all new camos available for every gun. A new "adaptive" camo has been introduced that can adapt the camo to the map being played without the player having to change camos every map. Camos can now be applied to jets, helicopters, tanks, transport vehicles and guns. Previously this option was introduced to parachutes but has been removed, emblems are now printed onto parachutes.

==Synopsis==

===Setting and characters===
''Battlefield 4''{{'}}s single-player Campaign takes place during the fictional "War of 2020", six years after the events of its [[Battlefield 3#Plot|predecessor]]. Tensions between [[Russia]] and the [[United States]] have been running at a record high, due to a conflict between the two countries that has been running for the last six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Battlefield 4-Hands on|url=http://uk.playstation.com/psn/news/articles/detail/item670543/Battlefield-4-hands-on/|publisher=Playstation UK|accessdate=December 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On top of this, [[China]] is also on the brink of war, as Admiral Chang, the main [[antagonist]], plans to overthrow China's current government. If he succeeds, Chang will have full support from the Russians, helping spark war between China and the United States.&lt;ref name="prologue_while-on-the-road"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Battlefield 4|developer=[[EA Digital Illusions CE]]|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|date=October 29, 2013|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]]/[[PlayStation 3]]/[[PlayStation 4]]/[[Xbox 360]]/[[Xbox One]]|version=|scene=|level=Baku|quote='''Dunn''': If the intel we got is right about Admiral Chang and the Russians, none of us is going home.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=baku_end /&gt;

===Plot===
{{long plot|date=July 2016}}
Set in 2020, six years after [[Battlefield 3#Plot|the events in New York]], ''Battlefield 4''{{'}}s Campaign primarily follows chronological order, and permanently casts the player as Recker. In the beginning, set in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], Tombstone Squad—consisting of Recker, Dunn, Irish, and Pac—escapes the city, with vital intelligence in hand and Russian special forces in hot pursuit.&lt;ref name="prologue_while-on-the-road" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Battlefield 4|developer=[[EA Digital Illusions CE]]|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|date=2013|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]]/[[PlayStation 3]]/[[PlayStation 4]]/[[Xbox 360]]/[[Xbox One]]|version=|scene=|level=Baku|quote='''Dunn''': Ease up, Pac.

Forced to continue on foot for two days, Tombstone makes their way down the mountain, forced to hunt for food to survive.

==Development==
Electronic Arts president Frank Gibeau confirmed the company's intention to release a sequel to ''Battlefield 3'' during a keynote at the [[University of Southern California]] where he said "There is going to be a ''Battlefield 4''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/09/report-ea-president-mentions-battlefield-4-during-college-keynote/|title=EA president mentions Battlefield 4 during college keynote|date=November 10, 2011|accessdate=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, an EA spokesperson told IGN: "Frank was speaking broadly about the ''Battlefield'' brand&amp;mdash;a brand that EA is deeply passionate about and a fan community that EA is committed to." On the eve of ''Battlefield 3''{{'}}s launch, EA Digital Illusions CE told Eurogamer it was the Swedish studio's hope that it would one day get the opportunity to make ''Battlefield 4''. "This feels like day one now," executive producer Patrick Bach said. "It's exciting. The whole Frostbite 2 thing has opened up a big landscape ahead of us so we can do whatever we want."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-11-10-ea-there-is-going-to-be-a-battlefield-4|title=EA: There Is Going To Be A BF4|publisher=Eurogamer|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|date=November 10, 2011|accessdate=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Battlefield 4'' is built on the new [[Frostbite 3]] engine. The new ''Frostbite'' engine enables more realistic environments with higher resolution textures and particle effects. A new "networked water" system is also being introduced, allowing all players in the game to see the same wave at the same time.&lt;ref name=bf4_fb3_feature /&gt; Tessellation has also been overhauled. An Alpha Trial commenced on June 17, 2013 with invitations randomly emailed to Battlefield 3 players the day prior. The trial ran for two weeks and featured the Siege of Shanghai map with all of its textures removed, essentially making it a "whitebox" test.&lt;ref name=bf4_fb3_feature /&gt;&lt;ref name="BF4-Frostbite3" /&gt;

Due to mixed reception of the two-player Co-op Mode in ''Battlefield 3'', DICE decided to omit the mode from ''Battlefield 4'' to focus on improving both the campaign and multiplayer components instead.&lt;ref name=gi_18things /&gt;&lt;ref name=bf4_on_xboxone /&gt;&lt;ref name=bf4_site_levolution&gt;{{cite web|title=Battlefield 4 Levolution|url=http://www.battlefield.com/battlefield-4/features/levolution|accessdate=September 26, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127025403/http://www.battlefield.com/battlefield-4/features/levolution|archivedate=November 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] and DICE have partnered for AMD's [[Mantle (API)|Mantle]] API to be used on Battlefield 4. The goal was to boost performance on AMD [[Graphics Core Next|GCN]] [[Radeon]] graphic cards providing a higher level of hardware-optimized performance than was previously possible with [[OpenGL]] or [[DirectX]].&lt;ref name=mantle&gt;{{cite web|last=Chacos|first=Brad|title=AMD's low-level Mantle graphics could mean big things for PC gaming|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2049560/amds-low-level-mantle-graphics-could-mean-big-things-for-pc-gaming.html|work=pcworld.com|publisher=[[pcworld]]|accessdate=Sep 29, 2013|date=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial tests of AMD's Mantle showed it was an effective enhancement for slower processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Battlefield 4 AMD Mantle and DirectX performance comparison|url=http://www.purepc.pl/karty_graficzne/test_procesorow_i_kart_graficznych_battlefield_4_mantle_vs_directx|date=February 7, 2014|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DICE released an Open Beta for the game that was available on Windows (64 bit only), Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It featured the game-modes Domination, Conquest and Obliteration which were playable on the map Siege of Shanghai. The Open Beta started on October 4, 2013 and ended on October 15, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Battlefield 4 Beta Information |url=https://help.ea.com/article/battlefield-4-beta-information |date=October 23, 2013 |accessdate=October 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192818/https://help.ea.com/article/battlefield-4-beta-information |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical issues and legal troubles===
Upon release, ''Battlefield 4'' was riddled with major technical bugs, glitches and crashes across all platforms. EA and DICE soon began releasing several patches for the game on all systems and DICE later revealed that work on all of its future games (including ''[[Mirror's Edge 2|Mirror's Edge]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront (2015 video game)|Star Wars: Battlefront]]'' and ''Battlefield 4'' DLC) would be halted until ''Battlefield 4'' was working properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Suszek| first = Mike| title = Battlefield 4 PC update addresses server crashes, frame rate issues [Update: Issues tracker added]| work = [[Joystiq]]| publisher = [[AOL]]| date = December 10, 2013| url = http://www.joystiq.com/2013/12/10/battlefield-4-pc-update-addresses-server-crashes-frame-rate-iss/| accessdate = December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Sliwinski| first = Alexander| title = Battlefield 4 patched on Xbox One, again| work = [[Joystiq]]| publisher = [[AOL]]| date = December 19, 2013| url = http://www.joystiq.com/2013/12/19/battlefield-4-patched-on-xbox-one-again/| accessdate = December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Cavalli| first = Earnest| title = Three Battlefield 4 updates follow Xbox One's bug-squashing lead| work = [[Joystiq]]| publisher = [[AOL]]| date = December 18, 2013| url = http://www.joystiq.com/2013/12/18/three-battlefield-4-updates-follow-xbox-ones-bug-squashing-lead/| accessdate = December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Sliwinski| first = Alexander| title = Battlefield 4 patched for PS3, 'small patch' for PS4| work = [[Joystiq]]| publisher = [[AOL]]| date = December 5, 2013| url = http://www.joystiq.com/2013/12/05/battlefield-4-patched-for-ps3-small-patch-for-ps4/| accessdate = December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Cavalli| first = Earnest| title = Delayed Battlefield 4 Xbox One update may arrive 'late this week'| work = [[Joystiq]]| publisher = [[AOL]]| date = December 12, 2013| url = http://www.joystiq.com/2013/12/12/delayed-battlefield-4-xbox-one-update-may-arrive-late-this-week/| accessdate = December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Hinkle| first = David| title = Battlefield 4 PC update eliminates kill trading| work = [[Joystiq]]| publisher = [[AOL]]| date = December 16, 2013| url = http://www.joystiq.com/2013/12/16/battlefield-4-pc-update-eliminates-kill-trading/| accessdate = December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2013, more than a month after the game's initial release, an EA representative said, "We know we still have a ways to go with fixing the game – it is absolutely our #1 priority. The team at DICE is working non-stop to update the game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Dyer| first = Mitch| title = Battlefield 4 Problems Halt 'Future Projects' and Expansions| work = [[IGN]]| publisher = [[Ziff Davis]]| date = December 4, 2013| url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/04/battlefield-4-problems-halt-future-projects-and-expansions| accessdate = December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EA President Peter Moore announced in January 2014 that the company did not see any negative impact to sales as a result of the myriad of technical issues. He said any negative impacts to sales were actually due to the transition from current-generation (PS3, Xbox 360) to next-generation consoles (PS4, Xbox One), and that other video game franchises like ''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'' and ''[[Need for Speed]]'' were experiencing similar effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Conditt| first = Jessica| title = Battlefield 4 sales not hurt by 'quality issues,' EA says| work = [[Joystiq]]| publisher = [[AOL]]| date = January 28, 2014| url = http://www.joystiq.com/2014/01/28/battlefield-4-sales-not-hurt-by-quality-issues-ea-says/| accessdate = February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a reward for players who bought the game early and continued to play it despite all of the bugs and glitches, DICE rewarded players in February 2014 with all-month-long, free multi-player content such as: bronze and silver [[Battlepack]]s, XP boosts and events, camouflage skins, shortcut bundles for weapons and additional content for Premium members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Hinkle| first = David| title = Battlefield 4 thanks players in February with daily Battlepacks, shortcut kits| work = [[Joystiq]]| publisher = [[AOL]]| date = January 28, 2014| url = http://www.joystiq.com/2014/01/28/battlefield-4-thanks-players-in-february-with-daily-battlepacks/| accessdate = February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the widespread bugs and glitches that were present, EA became the target of multiple law firms. The firm Holzer Holzer &amp; Fistel, LLC launched an investigation into EA's public statements made between July 24 and December 4, 2013 to determine if the company intentionally misled its investors with information pertaining to, "the development and sales of the Company's Battlefield 4 video game and the game's impact on EA's revenue and projects moving forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Cowan| first = Danny| title = Law firm investigating EA for allegedly misleading investors with Battlefield 4| work = [[Joystiq]]| publisher = [[AOL]]| date = December 11, 2013| url = http://www.joystiq.com/2013/12/11/law-firm-investigating-ea-for-allegedly-misleading-investors-wit/| accessdate = December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, the law firm [[Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd LLP]] similarly filed a class action lawsuit against EA for releasing false or misleading statements about the quality of ''Battlefield 4''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Cowan| first = Danny| title = Battlefield 4 targeted in class action lawsuit| work = [[Joystiq]]| publisher = [[AOL]]| date = December 19, 2013| url = http://www.joystiq.com/2013/12/19/battlefield-4-targeted-in-class-action-lawsuit/| accessdate = December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second class action lawsuit was announced only days later from the firm Bower Piven, which alleged that EA violated the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] by not properly informing its investors about the major bugs and glitches during development that may have prevented the investors from making an informed decision about ''Battlefield 4''. Bower Piven sought out investors who lost more than [[United States dollar|US$]]200,000 to become the lead plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Prell| first = S| title = EA finds itself in third law firm's iron sights over Battlefield 4 issues| work = [[Joystiq]]| publisher = [[AOL]]| date = December 21, 2013| url = http://www.joystiq.com/2013/12/21/ea-finds-itself-in-third-law-firms-iron-sights-over-battlefield/| accessdate = December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, Judge Susan Illston dismissed one of the class action suits' original case on the grounds that EA did not intentionally mislead investors, instead its pre-release claims about ''Battlefield 4'' were a "vague statement of corporate optimism," "an inactionable opinion" and "puffery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Cowan| first = Danny| title = Battlefield 4 class action lawsuit dismissed on 'puffery'| work = [[Joystiq]]| publisher = [[AOL]]| date = October 22, 2014| url = http://www.joystiq.com/2014/10/22/battlefield-4-class-action-lawsuit-dismissed-on-puffery/| accessdate = October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months after the initial release of the game, in April 2014, DICE released a program called Community Test Environment (CTE), which let a limited number of PC gamers play a different version of ''Battlefield 4'' that was designed to test new patches and updates before giving them a wide-release.&lt;ref name="IBT-CTE2014"&gt;{{cite web| last = Villapaz| first = Luke| title = 'Battlefield 4' Community Test Environment Enrollment Opens Up As EA DICE Turns To 'BF4' Players For Input On New Fixes| work = [[International Business Times]]| publisher = [[IBT Media]]| date = May 13, 2014| url = http://www.ibtimes.com/battlefield-4-community-test-environment-enrollment-opens-ea-dice-turns-bf4-players-input-1583824| accessdate = May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major patches tested was an update to the game's [[netcode]], specifically the "tickrate,"&lt;ref name="IBT-CTE2014"/&gt; which is how frequently the game and server would update, measured in cycles per second. Because of the size of ''Battlefield 4'' in terms of information, DICE initially chose to have a low tickrate. However, the low tickrate resulted in a number of issues including damage registration and "trade kills." The CTE program tested the game at a higher tickrate, among other common problems,&lt;ref name="IBT-CTE2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Marinconz| first = Steve| title = Battlefield 4 Is Finally Getting Fixed| work = [[Kotaku]]| publisher = [[Gawker]]| date = May 16, 2014| url = http://kotaku.com/battlefield-4-is-finally-getting-fixed-1577452991| accessdate = May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began rolling out patches in mid-2014.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In October 2014, nearly a full year after the official release with major updates still being put out, DICE LA producer David Sirland said the company acknowledged that the release of ''Battlefield 4'' "absolutely" damaged the trust of the franchise's fanbase.&lt;ref name="gamespot-oct2014"&gt;{{cite web| last = Makuch| first = Eddie| title = Battlefield 4's Rocky Launch 'Absolutely' Damaged Player Trust, Producer Says| work = [[GameSpot]]| publisher = [[CBS Interactive]]| date = October 7, 2014| url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-4s-rocky-launch-absolutely-damaged-pla/1100-6422805/| accessdate = October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sirland said that the shaky release of ''Battlefield 4'' caused the company to reevaluate their release model, and plan on being more transparent and offer earlier beta tests with future installments, namely (at the time) with ''[[Battlefield Hardline]]'' (2015). Sirland also said: "We still probably have a lot of players who won't trust us to deliver a stable launch or a stable game. I don't want to say anything because I want to ''do''. I want them to look at what we're doing and what we are going to do and that would be my answer. I think we have to ''do'' things to get them to trust us, not say things to get them to trust us. Show by doing."&lt;ref name="gamespot-oct2014"/&gt;

==Marketing==
In March 2013, [[Electronic Arts]] opened the ''Battlefield 4'' website with three official teasers, entitled "Prepare 4 Battle". Each hints at three kinds of [[battlespace]]: [[aerial warfare|air]], [[ground warfare|land]] and [[naval warfare|sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/3/25/4143958/battlefield-4-teaser-trailer-prepare-for-battle-air|title=Battlefield 4 teaser trailer 'Prepare for Battle: Air'|date=March 25, 2013|accessdate=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; EA then continued to release teaser trailers leading up to the unveiling of ''Battlefield 4'' at the [[Game Developers Conference]] on March 26, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD9fWUUeL00|title=Battlefield 4: 60 Second TV Spot|date=April 16, 2013|work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, ''Battlefield 4''{{'}}s first gameplay trailer, which doubled as a showcase for the [[Frostbite (game engine)|Frostbite 3]] engine&lt;ref name=trailer_gameplay_rev /&gt; was released. Shortly thereafter, EA listed the game for pre-order on Origin for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360; however, EA excluded any mention of the next generation consoles.

In July 2012, ''Battlefield 4'' was announced when EA advertised on their [[Origin (digital distribution software)|Origin]] client that those who pre-ordered ''[[Medal of Honor: Warfighter]] (either Digital Deluxe or the limited edition)'' would receive early access to the ''Battlefield 4'' beta, this has since been expanded to include any ''Battlefield 3'' Premium owners, and any Origin users who pre-purchase ''Battlefield 4'' Digital Deluxe Edition.&lt;ref name="medal of honor bonus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="retrailer gamespot" /&gt; Although players who qualify for access in more than one way will only be granted one beta pass for their account and is non transferable to other players. The "Exclusive" beta started on October 1, 2013, with the open beta that went live on October 4. The beta will be on three platforms, PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 and features the Siege of Shanghai map on the Conquest game mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.battlefield.com/battlefield-4/faq/beta|title=Battlefield 4 Beta|accessdate=September 2, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710052017/http://www.battlefield.com/battlefield-4/faq/beta|archivedate=July 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DICE revealed more ''Battlefield 4'' content in the E3 2013 event at June 10, 2013, such as multiplayer modes, and allowed participants to play the game at the same event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/472574/20130530/battlefield-4-multiplayer-e3-2013-skyrim-infamous.htm|title=Battlefield 4 Multiplayer at E3 2013|publisher=International Business Times|last=Galang|first=Gilda|date=May 30, 2013|accessdate=May 30, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623005633/http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/472574/20130530/battlefield-4-multiplayer-e3-2013-skyrim-infamous.htm|archivedate=June 23, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; More information was released at Gamescom 2013 in Cologne, Germany, such as the "Paracel Storm" multiplayer map and Battlefield 4 Premium. Battlefield 4 Premium includes five digital expansion packs featuring new maps and in-game content. Two-weeks early access to all expansion packs. Personalization options including camos, paints, emblems, dog tags and more. Priority position in server queues. Weekly updates with new content. Double XP events, 12 Battle Packs. Battle Packs are digital packages that contain a combination of new weapon accessories, dog tags, knives, XP boosts, and character customization items, three are included with all pre-orders of the Origin Digital Deluxe edition. The service will also transfer your Premium membership from Xbox 360 to Xbox One or PS3 to PS4. Premium membership pre-orders started the day the service was announced (August 21, 2013). DICE has also announced that if you purchase the game for a current generation system (PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360) you will be able to trade it in for a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One version of the game for as little as $10. Additionally all PlayStation 3 and 4 copies will include a code in the box to redeem a digital copy on the PlayStation Store.

An important strategy of [[EA Digital Illusions CE|DICE's]] [[market strategy]] to promote Battlefield 4 was the series of TV and web advertisements entitled ''Only in Battlefield 4''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ivan|first=Tom|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/tv-advert-highlights-only-battlefield-4-moments/|title=TV advert highlights "only in Battlefield 4" moments|publisher=Gamesradar|accessdate=December 6, 2013|date=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tucker|first=Travis|title=TV advert highlights "only in Battlefield 4" moments|url=http://www.stealthybox.com/new-battlefield-4-tv-ad-hypes-only-in-bf4-moments/|publisher=Stealthybox|accessdate=December 6, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208144917/http://www.stealthybox.com/new-battlefield-4-tv-ad-hypes-only-in-bf4-moments/|archivedate=December 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each one of these TV spots was narrated by a player of Battlefield 4 describing one of the unique experiences they encountered, along with a re-creation of the event using gameplay footage. These advertisements highlighted the free-form nature of the upcoming game, such as the destructibility of the environment and the dynamic nature of the game's combat engine. These events included things such as demonstrating the new ''Levolution'' feature, upgrades to gameplay, and unscripted moments that cannot occur in other games' [[multiplayer]] mode.

Due to poor reception from gamers, on May 30, 2013, EA discontinued the online pass for all existing and future EA games including ''Battlefield 4''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://help.ea.com/article/online-pass-has-been-discontinued |title=Online Pass has been discontinued, and its requirement for older games will be eliminated.&amp;#124;EA Help |work=help.ea.com |date=May 30, 2013 |accessdate=July 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914203902/https://help.ea.com/article/online-pass-has-been-discontinued |archivedate=September 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 2013, DICE unveiled ''Battlefield 4: Second Assault'' during the Microsoft Press Conference at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013|E3 2013]]. It was announced that it would be the first expansion pack to be released for ''Battlefield 4'' and would first debut on the [[Xbox One]]. It was released on November 22, 2013, the same day the Xbox One was launched. The expansion features the return of four fan-favorite maps from ''[[Battlefield 3]]'' and introduces [[Capture the Flag]] as a new gametype.

''Battlefield 4'' received positive reviews from critics. Chris Watters of ''[[GameSpot]]'' gave praise to Obliteration Mode and the multiplayer elements but was otherwise unimpressed with the campaign. [[IGN]]'s Mitch Dyer stated that "''Battlefield 4'' is a greatest hits album of DICE's multiplayer legacy" for same versions.&lt;ref name="IGNPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Evan Lahti of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' stated that although the game strongly resembles ''Battlefield 3'' it still manages to remain "a visually and sonically satisfying, reliably intense FPS".&lt;ref name="PCG"/&gt; Commander Mode and the diverse map selection within multiplayer were also praised as being good additions to the game. ''[[Joystiq]]'''s David Hinkle said that the game "drops players into a sandbox and unhooks all tethers, loosing scores of soldiers to squad up and take down the opposition however they choose". Hinkle praised the campaign elements, but found the multiplayer to not hold any surprises.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"/&gt; ''GameZone''{{'s}} Lance Liebl stated "Your success in Battlefield is up to you and how well you work as a team. And it's one of the most rewarding games I've played. Battlelog needs some refinement, and there's still way too many crashes, but the multiplayer more than makes up for all of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/2013/11/09/battlefield-4-review-great-when-it-works|title=Battlefield 4 review: great when it works|last=Liebl|first=Lance|publisher=GZ|date=November 9, 2013|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Machinima, Inc.|Machinima]]'s Lawrence Sonntag praised the Levolution feature and the multiplayer mode.&lt;ref name="insidegamingdaily"/&gt;

However several reviewers noted that the multiplayer part of the game had been released with a lot of game breaking bugs on PC, [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] (client or server crashes, lag).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incgamers.com/2013/11/battlefield-4-pc-review |title=Battlefield 4 Review |accessdate=December 1, 2013 |date=November 1, 2013|publisher=incgamers.com|quote=''Make no mistake: right now, you’re paying top dollar for a product that shouldn’t have been launched in this state.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/11/26/battlefield-4-xbox-one-review |title=Battlefield 4 Xbox One Review |accessdate=December 1, 2013 |date=November 26, 2013|publisher=IGN|quote=''Periodic crashes and connectivity issues can be irritating, if you're unfortunate enough to experience them.

DICE later acknowledged the issues with the multiplayer part of the game and said they were working to fix them, and that they would not work on expansions or future projects until the game problems were resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/dice-acknowledges-that-battlefield-4-pc-crashes-affecting-a-large-number-of-players/1100-6415937/ |title=DICE acknowledges that Battlefield 4 PC crashes "affecting a large number of players" |accessdate=December 1, 2013 |date=November 18, 2013|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|quote=''DICE has posted a Battlefield 4 update saying that the developer is looking into fixing numerous bugs across all platforms, including the game crashing on PC.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidegamingdaily.com/2013/12/05/dice-halts-work-on-other-projects-to-fix-battlefield-4/ |title=DICE Halts Work on Other projects to Fix Battlefield 4 |accessdate=December 15, 2013 |date=December 5, 2013|publisher=insidegamingdaily.com|quote=''According to a statement issued by EA, the studio is “not moving onto future projects or expansions until we sort out all the issues with Battlefield 4.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this promise, the game's second expansion was released while numerous recurring problems had yet to be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://answers.ea.com/t5/Battlefield-4/Known-Battlefield-4-Issues-and-Next-Steps-Updated-Feb-13/td-p/1767613 |title=Known Battlefield 4 Issues and Next Steps (Updated: Feb 25) - Answer HQ |publisher=Answers.ea.com |date=October 30, 2013 |accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ban in China===
In late December 2013, shortly after the release of the "China Rising" DLC pack, [[Censorship in China|China banned]] the sale of ''Battlefield 4'', requesting stores and online vendors to remove the game and encouraging those who have already purchased the game to remove it from their consoles and/or PCs. The game was viewed as a national security risk in the form of a cultural invasion as the DLC includes four maps on the Chinese mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/battlefield-china-banned-illegal-shooter,25542.html|title=Battlefield 4 now banned in China|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial from the ''China National Defense Newspaper'' (a subsidiary of the [[PLA Daily]]) published in December 2013 criticized the game for discrediting China's national sovereignty, and stated that while in the past the [[Soviet Union]] would often be used as an imaginary enemy in video games, the shift has recently turned to China.&lt;ref&gt;宫玉聪, 2013-12-11, [http://games.qq.com/a/20131211/010142.htm 官媒：国外游戏抹黑中国形象 扭曲事实误导青少年] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208182130/http://games.qq.com/a/20131211/010142.htm |date=December 8, 2015 }}, 中国国防报&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sales===
During the first week of sales in the United Kingdom, ''Battlefield 4'' became the second best-selling game on all available formats, only behind ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Scammell |first=David |date=November 7, 2013 |url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/assassins_creed_4_black_flag/news/assassins_creed_sales_down_60_year-on-year_battlefield_4_down_69_on_battlefield_3.html |title=Assassin's Creed sales down 60% year-on-year, Battlefield 4 down 69% on Battlefield 3 |accessdate=December 20, 2013 |work=VideoGamer.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's sales were down 69% compared to 2011's ''Battlefield 3''. EA blamed the fall in demand on uncertainty caused by the upcoming transition to [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation]] consoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghostcompany.net/ea-next-gen-consoles-are-the-reason-for-lower-sales-of-battlefield-4/ |title=EA: Next-Gen consoles are the reason for lower sales of Battlefield 4! |publisher=Ghost Company |date= |accessdate=March 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222014143/http://ghostcompany.net/ea-next-gen-consoles-are-the-reason-for-lower-sales-of-battlefield-4/ |archivedate=February 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Will there be the same Levolution (falling building) or different Levolution in other maps?"'''&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Levolution occurs on every map. Some things are massive like reducing a skyscraper to rubble or flooding an entire level in real-time. Others are small but hugely impact the game like shooting fire extinguishers to distract enemies or cutting the power of a building to blind opponents.&lt;br /&gt;If you haven’t seen the Paracel Storm map we unveiled at Gamescom we encourage you to do so. There you can see how players have the option of taking down a turbine weakened by lightning in order to free the damaged destroyer stuck on it. If you manage to set the destroyer adrift, it will crash onto the island, changing the layout of the map and allowing your team to take control of the anti-air weaponry on the ship.&lt;br /&gt;These moments are all triggered by the players – they aren’t just timed moments that will happen no matter what you do in the match. You and your teammates will have to decide if it would be a better tactical decision to radically change the map, or if it would be wiser and better for your play-style if you stopped the other team from triggering these events.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We will ensure it was not in vain. The storm has grounded enemy aircraft—but it won’t be for long. We may be the only ship left, but we will ''not'' go down without a fight. We will steam west. We’ll strike the airfield under storm cover and create a safe passage through the Singapore Strait. Strike with speed and courage. Let this storm carry us home.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2478">The '''Bracken School Readiness Assessment ("BSRA")''' is an individual concept knowledge test designed for children, pre-K through second grade.

The BSRA was developed by [[Bruce A. Bracken]] and first published in 2002 by The Psychological Corporation. Raw scores can be converted to percentile rank scores and standard scores. The publisher has supporting guides for converting standard scores into criterion categories (e.g. "advanced" or "delayed"). Reliability measures were within expected ranges given the age of the students. Validity was assessed using other published assessments (e.g. [[Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence|WPPSI-R]], [[Differential Ability Scales|DAS]]). The BSRA Spanish Edition was developed, normed, and validated independently. The BSRA can be used with children as young as 2.6 years of age. The BSRA is composed of the first six subtests from the revised Bracken Basic Concepts Scale (BBCS-R).

==Skills tested==
The test assesses six basic skills:
:*'''Colors'''  Student must identify common colors by name.
:*'''Letters'''  Students must identify upper-case and lower-case letters.
:*'''Numbers | Counting'''  Student must identify single- and double-digit numerals, and must count objects.
:*'''Sizes'''  Student must demonstrate knowledge of words used to depict size (e.g., tall, wide, etc.)
:*'''Comparisons'''  Student must match or differentiate objects based on a specific characteristic.
:*'''Shapes'''  Student must identify basic shapes by name.

The '''UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions''' is a binding international legal instrument&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf 30 frequently asked questions concerning the Convention and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[UNESCO]] [[multilateral treaty|convention]] adopted by the UNESCO General Conference on 20 October 2005, during the 33rd session of the UNESCO General Conference held in Paris, France on 3–21 October 2005. The convention compliments the previously established provisions of UNESCO including the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity of 2001. "The Convention recognises the rights of Parties to take measures to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions, and impose obligations at both domestic and international levels on Parties."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/publications-and-documents/treaty-command-papers-ems/explanatory-memoranda/explanatory-memoranda-2007a/unesco United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention is available in six authoritative texts including Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=31038&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2016, the Convention has 146 parties&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=31038&amp;language=E|title=Conventions|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which includes 145 states and the [[European Union]].

==Background==
The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is a precursor for seven UNESCO conventions which deal with the four core areas of creative diversity; cultural and natural heritage, movable cultural property, intangible cultural heritage and contemporary creativity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf Ten Keys to the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt; These seven UNESCO conventions include the Universal Copyright Convention (1952, followed by a revision in 1971), the Convention for the Protection and Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (1954/1999), the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (1970), the Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage (1972), the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage (2001), the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (2003),and the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (2005).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions deals with specific articles in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, Articles 8 through 11. These articles clarify three issues. First, the relationship that identity has with cultural goods and services, which values and meaning should not be treated as economic goods. Second, the States have the responsibility for the protection and promotion for the "diversity of cultural expressions and ensuring the free flow of ideas and works".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Third, there needs to be international co-operation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is a legally binding international agreement that ensures artists, cultural professionals, practitioners and citizens worldwide can create, produce, disseminate and enjoy a broad range of cultural goods, services and activities, including their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/cultural-diversity/2005-convention/the-convention/what-is-the-convention/ UNESCO 2005 Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural expressions are conveyed by activities, goods and services, which results in an economic and cultural nature. Due to this dual sided nature, cultural expressions cannot be seen purely as objects of trade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions main objective is to strengthen creation, production, distribution/dissemination, access and enjoyment of cultural expressions transmitted by cultural activities, goods and services, with a strong focus on developing countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The promotion of dialogue and creativity of cultural diversity is an necessary element in the goal to achieve peace and sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Convention was adopted in response to  "growing pressure exerted on countries to waive their right to enforce cultural policies and to put all aspects of the cultural sector on the table when negotiating international trade agreements."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc-ccd.org/IMG/pdf/CDC_LowRez_EN.pdf Coalition for Cultural Diversity]&lt;/ref&gt; "The international community signalled the urgency to implement an international law that would recognize the distinctive nature of cultural goods, services and activities as vehicles of identity, values and meaning and that while cultural goods, services and activities have important economic value, they are not mere commodities or consumer goods that can only be regarded as objects of trade."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/cultural-diversity/2005-convention/the-convention/what-is-the-convention/ UNESCO 2005 Convention]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention's main objective is to provide a legally binding international agreement that reaffirms the sovereign right of States to adopt cultural policies that support their cultural industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc-ccd.org/IMG/pdf/CDC_LowRez_EN.pdf Coalition for Cultural Diversity]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention does not want to control and restrict cultural expressions, but to promote and protect them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf Ten Keys to the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that the diversity of cultural expressions is a "rich asset for individuals and societies, the protection, promotion and maintenance of [[cultural diversity]] are an essential requirement for [[sustainable development]] for the benefit of present and future generations.".&lt;ref&gt;''UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions'', Article 2 Paragraph 6 [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/cultural-diversity/2005-convention/the-convention/convention-text/]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention also defines on [[cultural industry]] and [[interculturality]]&lt;ref&gt;''UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions'', Article 4 Paragraph 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the late 1980s, a growing number of countries were showing concern that "the proliferation of trade agreements promoting absolute market liberalization dramatically increased the threat to [[cultural industry|cultural industries]]. Countries wishing to retain their right to enforce cultural policies risked being marginalized and unable to maintain their position."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc-ccd.org/IMG/pdf/CDC_LowRez_EN.pdf Coalition for Cultural Diversity]&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2001, the [[Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity|UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity]] was adopted&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=35232&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html ''UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity'']&lt;/ref&gt; and 21 May was declared the  [[World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development]]

The preliminary draft was drawn up over a series of two years, 2003–2005. The Director-General of UNESCO assigned fifteen experts to write a draft called the Convention on the Protection of the Diversity of Cultural Contents and Artistic Expressions. Meetings were held for suggested improvements and the draft eventually led to the adoption of the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions on 20 October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf 30 frequently asked questions concerning the Convention and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The beneficiaries to the Convention are unlimited. The Convention benefits all peoples because the ability to participate and promote cultural diversity is profitable for all individuals and societies. Also, recognition for the creators of cultural expressions and the communities that celebrate their works. A major beneficiary to the Convention are the artists and practitioners of the cultural expressions.
In addition to the broad ranged beneficiaries, the Convention lists several specific groups such as women, indigenous peoples, minorities, and artists and practitioners of developing nations. Countries with the inability to produce and disseminate their own cultural expressions, such as developing nations. The Convention provides such need based nations financial assistance for the artists and practitioners of cultural expressions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf Ten Keys to the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==General objectives to the 2005 Convention==

The main objective for the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf 30 frequently asked questions concerning the Convention and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention highlights the fact that cultural creativity has been placed upon all of humanity and that aside from economical gains, creative diversity reaps plenty of cultural and social advantages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf Ten Keys to the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt; States must also promote "openness to other cultures of the world". Protective measures are also included in the Convention and international co-operation is encouraged in times of need. This Convention works to strengthen economic growth and cultural acceptance.

Additional objectives are as follows:

*To reaffirm the sovereign rights of States to adopt cultural policies while ensuring the free movement of ideas and works.
*To recognise the distinct nature of cultural goods and services as vehicles of values, identity and meaning.
*To define a new framework for international cultural co-operation, the keystone of the Convention
*To create the conditions for cultures to flourish and freely interact in a mutually beneficial manner
*To endeavour to support co-operation for [[sustainable development]] and [[poverty reduction]], via assistance from the International Fund for Cultural Diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002148/214824e.pdf Basic Texts of the 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt;
*To ensure that civil society plays a major role in the implementation of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifccd.com/ International Federation of Coalitions for Cultural Diversity (IFCCD)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*To "strengthen international cooperation and solidarity with a view to favouring the cultural expressions of all countries, in particular those whose cultural goods and services suffer from lack of access to the means of creation, production and dissemination at the national and international level."&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf 30 frequently asked questions concerning the Convention and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention also affirms that "Cultural diversity can be protected and promoted only if human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of expression, information and communication, as well as the ability of individuals to choose cultural expresions, are guaranteed."&lt;ref&gt;''UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions'', Article 2, Paragraph 1&lt;/ref&gt; in a manner against a [[cultural relativism]] that may undermine universality of human rights.

'''Divergence''' in [[linguistics]] refers to one of the five principles by which you can detect [[grammaticalisation]] while it is taking place. The other four are: [[Layering (linguistics)|layering]], [[specialization (linguistics)|specialisation]], [[persistence (linguistics)|persistence]], and [[de-categorialisation]].

Divergence names a state of affairs subsequent to some change, namely the result of the process called "split" by [[Bernd Heine|Heine]] and Reh. "When a [[lexicon|lexical]] form undergoes grammaticalization to a [[clitic]] or [[affix]], the original form may remain as an autonomous lexical element and undergo the same changes as ordinary lexical items." (Hopper 1991: 22) A possible formal distinction between divergence and split would be that the latter seems to be confined to cases where one and the same source has several targets, whereas the former merely refers to the drifting apart of previously more similar items.

The form of a lexical item may undergo different changes from its grammaticalised counterpart.

The '''End of Course Test (EOCT, EOC, or EOC Test)''' is an academic assessment conducted in many states by the State Board of Education. [[Georgia Department of Education|Georgia]], for example, tests from the ninth to twelfth grades, and North Carolina tests for any of the four core class subjects (math, science, social studies, and English). 

[[North Carolina]] schools administer an EOCT in English II, Math I (Algebra I), and Biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncpublicschools.org/accountability/testing/eoc/ |title=NC BOE Accountability Services |website=Ncpublicschools.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The official purpose of the test is to assess both individual and group knowledge and skills.  EOCTs are mandatory and require a minimum score for [[graduation]] eligibility. Additionally, a North Carolina student's EOCT score must account for at least 25% of the student's final grade in the relevant course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncpublicschools.org/docs/accountability/testing/briefs/opereocassessmentbrief2005.pdf|format=PDF|title=Understanding the North Carolina End-of-Course Tests|website=Ncpublicschools.org|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]] [[high schools]] are required to administer a [[standardized test|standardized]], [[multiple-choice]] EOCT, in each of eight core subjects including Algebra I, Geometry, U.S. History, Economics, Biology, Physical Science, Ninth Grade Literature and Composition, and American Literature and Composition.  The official purpose of the tests is to assess "specific content knowledge and skills."  Although a minimum test score is not required for the student to receive [[Carnegie Unit and Student Hour|credit]] in the course or to graduate from high school, completion of the test is mandatory.  The EOCT score comprises 20% of a student's grade in the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.doe.k12.ga.us/ci_testing.aspx?PageReq=CI_TESTING_EOCT |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502005611/http://www.doe.k12.ga.us/ci_testing.aspx?PageReq=CI_TESTING_EOCT |archive-date=2010-05-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the EOCT is an official, state-administered test, any violation or interference can result in the invalidation of scores of all students taking the exam on that subject. Interferences can include [[cellphone]]s, [[mp3 player]]s, reading books on the same subject as the exam, and talking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Georgia EOCT Examiner's Manual |publisher=Georgia Department of Education |url=http://www.doe.k12.ga.us/DMGetDocument.aspx/EOCT%20Examiner%20Manual%20Spring%202008.pdf?p=6CC6799F8C1371F6311D72520557EC57DC180675F2092EB5D87627264AA65391&amp;Type=D |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, E.O.C tests can be taken in middle schools.For example in the state of Florida it is mandatory for 7th graders (Middle school) to take a Civics EOC Test. A student can pass only if he attains a level of 3, 4 or 5.

'''Ethnocynology''', is a [[neologism]] coined by [[anthropologist]] [[Bryan Cummins]] in his book ''First Nations, First Dogs: Canadian Aboriginal Ethnocynology'' (2002).  It refers to the study of [[dog]]s within their cultural contexts.  The term is not in general use.  

Cummins states that the domestic dog, despite being found in virtually all human [[society|societies]], has been ignored by anthropologists. This, he says, is because the dog is neither fully of "[[culture]]" (being essentially a domesticated [[wolf]]), nor of "nature", by virtue of that same [[domestication]] and having been molded into over 400 [[breed]]s. Nonetheless, Cummins leans towards the view that, being domestic animals, they are more "of culture" than "of nature", and culture is the domain of the anthropologist. Furthermore, different human societies have shaped the dog into precisely whatever roles people might have for the dog. Therefore, the domestic dog is worthy of anthropological attention; hence ethnocynology.

A '''floating tone''' is a [[morpheme]]&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Mary M. 1993. "Representation of downstep in Dschang Bamileke". The Phonology of Tone: The Representation of Tonal Register, ed. by Harry van der Hulst and Keith Snider. Berlin/New York: Mouton de Gruyter. Pp. 29-73&lt;/ref&gt; or element of a morpheme that contains no [[consonant]]s, no [[vowel]]s, but only [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. It cannot be pronounced by itself, but affects the tones of neighboring morphemes.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Paster, UC Berkeley, "FLOATING TONES IN GÃ *" http://elanguage.net/journals/index.php/sal/article/view/1366/925&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wentum, Comfort. 1997. A Lexical Tonology of Ga. Legon: University of Ghana, M. Phil thesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example occurs in [[Bambara language|Bambara]]. Bambara has two [[phoneme|phonemic]] tones,&lt;ref&gt;Clements, G. N. and Kevin C. Ford. 1979. "Kikuyu tone shift and its synchronic consequences." Linguistic Inquiry 10: 179-210.&lt;/ref&gt; ''high'' and ''low.'' In this language, the [[definite article]] is a floating low tone. With a noun in isolation, it is associated with the preceding vowel, turning a high tone into a falling tone: [bá] ''river;'' [bâ] ''the river''. When it occurs between two high tones, it [[downstep (phonetics)|downstep]]s the following tone:
*{{IPA|[bá tɛ́]}} ''it's not a river''
*{{IPA|[bá tɛ̄]}} (or {{IPA|[bá ꜜ tɛ́]}}) ''it's not the river''

Also common are floating tones associated with a [[segment (linguistics)|segment]]al morpheme such as an affix.&lt;ref&gt;Kropp-Dakubu, Mary E. 1986. "Downglide, floating tones and non-WH questions in Ga and Dangme." The Phonological Representation ofSuprasegmentais, ed. by Koen Bogers, Harry van der Hulst, and Maarten Mous. Dordrecht: Foris Publications. Pp. 153-173.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Okphela language|Okphela]], an [[Edoid languages|Edoid language]] of Nigeria,&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, 1. 1858. A grammatical sketch and vocabulary of the Akra- or Galanguage with an appendix on the Adanme dialect. Stuttgart, 2 vols. Republished with an Introduction by 1. Berry, Gregg International, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; the main negative morpheme is distinguished from the present tense morpheme by tone; the present tense morpheme (á-) carries high tone, whereas the negative past morpheme (´a-) imposes a high tone on the syllable which precedes it:

*oh á-nga ''he is climbing''
*óh a-nga ''he didn't climb''

Floating tones derive historically from morphemes which [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilate]]&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, John. 1976. Autosegmental Phonology. Cambridge: MIT, PhD. dissertation. Distributed by IULe.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[lenition|lenite]]&lt;ref&gt;Okunor, Vincent. 1969. Tone in the Ga verb. Legon: Institute of African Studies. Paster, Mary. 2000. "Issues in the tonology of Ga."

This festival marks the first of the three harvests of the [[Celtic calendar|year]] and the time for collecting young tender vegetables such as peas, beans and early fruits. It is also the time for the collection of honey.&lt;ref name="Bramshaw2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vikki Bramshaw|title=Craft of the Wise: A Practical Guide to Paganism and Witchcraft|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K42r6blWAdEC&amp;pg=PA249|accessdate=9 September 2012|date=30 November 2009|publisher=O Books|isbn=978-1-84694-232-7|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical references==
* In August 1402, the Gathering Day festival had to be postponed till September when [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] faced a threat of invasion of the North from the Duke of Albany and the Earl of Douglas with a large army of Scots.&lt;ref name="Wylie1884"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Hamilton Wylie|title=History of England Under Henry the Fourth: 1399-1404|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rzgIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA285|accessdate=9 September 2012|year=1884|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is believed that till 1917 the town of [[Killorglin]] in [[County Kerry|Kerry]] followed the tradition of the ''puck'' or he-goat which was collected by the youth of the town, [[coronation|crown]]ed as king, put on display for three days and then paraded in the town.&lt;ref name="Chatterbox"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chatterbox|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jjdAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA139|accessdate=9 September 2012|year=1917|publisher=American News Company|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Monaghan2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patricia Monaghan|title=The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nd9R6GQBB_0C&amp;pg=PA218|accessdate=9 September 2012|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1037-0|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goat's reputation as a randy creature may hint at the licentious behaviour common during this festival. Although believed by locals to be a very ancient festival, experts believe that it cannot be more than 300 years old due to the usage of the term ''puck'' and the goat's lack of symbolic significance in [[Celts|Celtic]] culture.&lt;ref name="Monaghan2009"/&gt;

'''''Ghost in the Shell''''' is a 2017 American [[science fiction film]] &lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD MORE GENRES. as per [[WP:FILMLEAD]] we should only have the main genre in the lead sentence. --&gt; directed by [[Rupert Sanders]] and written by [[Jamie Moss]], William Wheeler, and [[Ehren Kruger]], based on the [[Japanese people#Arts|Japanese]] [[manga]] [[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|of the same name]] by [[Masamune Shirow]]. It stars [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Takeshi Kitano]], [[Michael Pitt]], [[Pilou Asbæk]], [[Ng Chin Han|Chin Han]] and [[Juliette Binoche]]. Set in a near future when the line between humans and robots is blurring, the plot follows the [[Motoko Kusanagi|Major]] (Johansson), a [[cyborg]] [[supersoldier]] who investigates her past.

Filming for ''Ghost in the Shell'' took place in New Zealand from February to June 2016, with additional filming in Hong Kong that June. The film premiered in Tokyo on March 16, 2017, and was released in the United States on March 31, 2017, in 2D, [[3D film|3D]], [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]] and [[4DX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cineworld.co.uk/blog/5-reasons-why-you-need-to-experience-ghost-in-the-shell-in-mind-blowing-4dx |title=5 reasons why you need to experience Ghost in the Shell in mind-blowing 4DX |work=Cineworld.co.uk |date=March 17, 2017 |accessdate=May 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received mixed reviews, with praise for its visual style, action sequences, cinematography and score, but criticism for its story and lack of character development.

==Plot==
In the near future, humans are [[Human enhancement|augmented]] with cybernetic improvements to traits such as vision, strength, and intelligence. Augmentation developer Hanka Robotics establishes a secret project to develop an artificial body, or "shell", that can [[Brain–computer interface|integrate]] a human brain rather than an [[artificial intelligence|AI]]. Mira Killian, the sole survivor of a [[cyberterrorist]] attack which killed her parents, is chosen as the test subject after her body is damaged beyond repair. Over the objections of her designer Dr. Ouelet, Hanka's CEO, Cutter, decides to use Killian as a [[counter-terrorism]] operative.

A year later, Killian has attained the rank of Major in the anti-terrorist bureau [[Section 9]], working alongside operatives [[Batou]] and [[Togusa]] under [[Daisuke Aramaki|Chief Daisuke Aramaki]]. Killian, who experiences hallucinations that Ouelet dismisses as [[glitch]]es, is troubled by how little she remembers of her past. The team thwarts a terrorist attack on a Hanka business conference, and Killian destroys a robotic [[geisha]] after it murders a hostage. After learning that the geisha was hacked by an unknown entity known as [[Hideo Kuze|Kuze]], Killian breaks protocol and "dives" into its AI for answers. The entity attempts a counter-hack, and Batou is forced to disconnect her. They trace the hacker to a [[yakuza]] nightclub, where they are lured into a trap. The explosion destroys Batou's eyes and damages Killian's body. Cutter is enraged by Killian's actions, and threatens to have Section 9 shut down unless Aramaki keeps her in line.

Kuze tracks down Section 9's Hanka consultant, Dr. Dahlin, and kills her. The team links her murder to the deaths of other senior company researchers and realize that Ouelet is the next target. Kuze takes control of two sanitation workers and sends them to kill Ouelet. Batou, now with [[Visual prosthesis|cybernetic eyes]], kills one while the repaired Killian subdues the other. While they interrogate the worker, Kuze speaks through him before compelling him to commit suicide. Togusa traces the hack to a secret location, where the team discovers a large number of humans mentally linked as a makeshift signal network. Killian is captured and Kuze reveals that he is a failed Hanka test subject from the same project that created Killian. He urges her to question her own memories, then frees her and escapes.

Killian confronts Ouelet, who admits that 98 test subjects died before Killian, and that her memories are [[Memory implantation|implanted]]. Cutter has decided that Killian is a liability and orders Ouelet to kill her after she returns to Hanka Robotics. Instead, Ouelet gives Killian an address and helps her escape. Cutter kills Ouelet, but blames Killian, saying that she has gone rogue. He informs Aramaki and the team that Killian must be terminated.

Killian follows the address to an apartment occupied by a widowed mother, who reveals that her daughter, [[Motoko Kusanagi]], ran away from home a year ago and was arrested. Motoko took her own life while in custody. Killian leaves and contacts Aramaki, who allows Cutter to remotely eavesdrop on their conversation. Batou, Togusa, and Aramaki eliminate Cutter's men trying to ambush them, while Killian follows her memories to the hideaway where Motoko was last seen. There, she and Kuze meet and recall their past lives as anti-augmentation radicals who were abducted by Hanka as test subjects.

Cutter deploys a "spider-tank" to kill them. Kuze nearly dies before Killian is able to tear off the tank's motor, losing an arm in the process. Mortally wounded, Kuze offers to merge his "ghost" with Killian's, but Killian refuses. Kuze fades out, then a Hanka sniper kills him. Batou and the team rescue Killian, while Aramaki executes Cutter with Killian's consent. The next day, Killian, now repaired and embracing her true [[Identity (social science)|identity]] as the Japanese Motoko, reconnects with her mother and returns to work with Section 9.

Kyle Davies, domestic distribution chief for Paramount, felt the controversy around the casting had damaged reviews, and said: "...you're always trying to thread that needle between honoring the source material and mak[ing] a movie for a mass audience.

[[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' expressed disappointment at the absence of the original's "big, human, all-too-human questions" in contrast to the retention of action clichés, such as chases and gun fights. Dargis also criticized the absence of the unique setting, stating that "The original manga takes place in what’s described as a "strange corporate conglomerate-state called ‘Japan,’" while this movie unwinds nowhere in particular, just a universal megalopolis filled with soaring gray towers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Manohla Darqis|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/movies/ghost-in-the-shell-review-scarlett-johansson.html|title=Review: In ‘Ghost in the Shell,’ a Cyborg With Soul|work=The New York Times|date=March 30, 2017|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Suderman of ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' and Emily Yoshida of ''[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]'' criticized the removal of philosophical ideas from the story, feeling the movie westernized the story and changed the search for the idea of a soul to finding individuality and memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Jennifer|url=https://www.vox.com/2017/4/4/15138682/ghost-in-the-shell-anime-philosophy|title=The original Ghost in the Shell is iconic anime, and a rich philosophical text|work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|date=April 4, 2017|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emily Yoshida|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/03/ghost-in-the-shell-movie-review.html|title='Ghost in the Shell' Movie Review: A Shoddy, Soulless Remake|work=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]|date=March 30, 2017|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others called it an action movie that for once does not throw philosophy overboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Ghost in the Shell": Was vom Menschen übrig blieb - WELT|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/kino/article163229654/Was-vom-Menschen-uebrig-blieb.html|work=DIE WELT|accessdate=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, fans were surprised that the casting had caused controversy, as they had already assumed that a Hollywood production would choose a white actress.

'''Haitian Vodou art''' is art related to the [[Haitian Vodou]] religion. This religion has its roots in West African traditional religions brought to [[Haiti]] by slaves, but has assimilated elements from Europe and the Americas and continues to evolve. The most distinctive Vodou art form is the ''drapo Vodou'', an embroidered flag often decorated with sequins or beads, but the term covers a wide range of visual art forms including paintings, embroidered clothing, clay or wooden figures, musical instruments and assemblages. Since the 1950s there has been growing demand for Vodou art by tourists and collectors.

==Origins==

Art historians disagree on the origins of Haitian Vodou arts. [[Suzanne Blier]] makes the case that they come from the coastal areas of [[Benin]] and [[Togo]]. [[Robert Farris Thompson]] makes a plausible connection with Central Africa based on similarities with ''[[nkisi]]'' figures from the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]], and cosmograms, flags, drums and dances from that region.{{sfn|Vanhee|2002|p=244}}

The first slaves from West and Central Africa were brought to the Caribbean in the 16th century. Europeans often claimed that the slaves were being rescued from devil worship. 
However, the slaves maintained their religious practices in secret, and their priests were among the leaders of the first revolt in [[Haiti]] in 1791.{{sfn|Hodgson|2001}}
Haiti became the first independent nation of African people in the [[Western Hemisphere]] in 1804 under President [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]].{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
The traditional religion continued to be banned, and as late as the 1940s the Catholic church undertook a campaign against Vodou, ransacked temples and burned religious artifacts. 
Many of the techniques of sacred art have now been forgotten, and few sculptures were being made by 2001.{{sfn|Hodgson|2001}}
The Vodou religion was finally recognized officially in 2002.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

The great majority of Haitians still practice the Vodou{{efn|The word ''Vodou'' means spirit.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}}} religion. 
The religion continues to evolve, and in addition to the traditional West African ''lwo'' (spirits) it now includes the spirits of heroes of resistance to the colonial forces, and spirits of powerful religious leaders.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
The iconography of the Haitian Vodou religion combines elements from Africa, Europe and the Americas.{{sfn|Cosentino|2013}}
Thus a ''drapo'' made for an African spirit may include an image of a Catholic saint. 
The saint's image was originally in part designed to deceive Catholic missionaries, but also was chosen in recognition of similarity between the saint and the ''lwa''.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}}
Since then the saint and the spirit have become [[Syncretism|syncretized]].{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}

==Interpretation==
[[File:Antique ceremonial suit for Haitian Vodou Voudun rites.jpg|thumb|Antique ceremonial suit for Haitian Vodou rites]]
Vodou art can be difficult to classify in Western terms. 
Rachel Beauvoir-Dominique, writing of Marianne Lehmann's{{efn|Marianne Lehmann is a former Swiss diplomat who made her home in Port au Prince, Haiti, where she collected about 2,000 examples of Haitian sacred art over a twenty year period. [[UNESCO]] has contributed some funds towards indexing and photographing the collection, which includes musical instruments, figures dressed in costumes and other artifacts.{{sfn|Hodgson|2001}} }} Vodou art collection, notes that "even today, the Creole language does not possess any word to designate what Western civilization qualifies as 'art'."{{sfn|Benedicty-Kokken|2014|p=244}}
Poet and critic [[André Breton]] dismissed Haitian art, noting that Haiti had no museums or art collections. 
He apparently saw no value in the art associated with the "backward" Vodou religion.{{sfn|Benedicty-Kokken|2014|p=245}}

Some scholars distinguish narrative Haitian art, which may include depictions of events or ceremonies in which there are many images from Vodou, from "Vodou art" in the sense of art that has a sacred function. The latter would be designed for use in ceremonies or for placement in temples or on altars. 
Given the omnipresence of Vodou in Haiti, most narrative art would also include Vodou images.{{sfn|Crown|Rivers|Wilson|2013|p=110-111}}
However, the fluid and adaptive nature of Vodou makes it hard to clearly distinguish religion, art and religious art.{{sfn|Harvey|2014|p=219}}

Alessandra Benedicty points out that Western scholars are led by their [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] intellectual framework into trying to explain Vodou art in terms of "intellectual truths". 
Vodou is open-ended and sometimes purposely dissimulates. 
Benedicty writes that in "the Vodou/Haitian aesthetic system, the ''objet d'art'' nurtures ambivalence and demands that the reader or the spectator interpret and thus participate in the production of an artistic text's meaning."  If there is a ''[[veve]]'' in the work, there is a possibility that the ''[[lwa]]'' the work was made for will possess the viewer.{{sfn|Glover|2010|p=194}}
The purchaser of a Vodou altar or other artwork may be possessed by their purchase.{{sfn|Harvey|2014|p=219}}
A 1995 exhibit at the Fowler Museum of Cultural History in California of "The Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou"  included dramatic ritual interactions between Vodouists and ''lwa'' that may have included possession.{{sfn|Harvey|2014|p=219}}

==Drapo==
A ''drapo Vodou'' is a handmade flag, typically embroidered and decorated with beads and sequins.
Although flags may have been made in West Africa before the arrival of Europeans, the flags widely used there by 1600 were derived from European flags. 
They were used as symbols of ethnic, military or religious allegiance.
The ''drapo Vodou'' also drew on Yoruba beadwork, Catholic vestments and Masonic aprons.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
In the 19th century and early 20th century most ''drapo Vodou'' were made from one or two colored fabric pieces decorated with embroidery, metal bangles and glass beads, with an image of the ''lwa'' made of shiny fabrics [[appliqué]]d to the cloth using techniques still followed in West Africa.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
Flags and banners used in the 21st century in rural areas often still have stylistically simple designs, in part due to the high cost of decorative material.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=18}}

With the older flags the background field that frames the image was usually decorated with widely spaced sequins or beads. 
Modern flag makers often completely cover the fabric of the field with sparkling sequins of one color, or with intricate geometrical patterns. 
Borders, which were either simple or did not exist on early ''drapo Vodou'', have evolved into highly elaborate patterns.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=21}}
The use of sequins in modern ''drapos'' dates to 1940, when Joseph Fortine saw a troupe of Afro-Brazilian samba dancers wearing sequin costumes in a Carnival parade. Fortine began to decorate the costumes of [[Rara]] band players with sequins, and in 1943 made a ''drapo Vodou'' for [[Damballa]] from a burlap coffee sack which he stretched on a wooden frame.
He made the image from sequin lines on a satin background, and added random sequins surrounding the image. 
Fortine taught his techniques to sequin artists such as Edgard Jean Louis, Sylva Joseph, Clotaire Bazile, and Yves Telemak. 
The youngest of these, Telemak, was the first to sign his work.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

There are two kinds of ''drapo Vodou''. The ''drapo servis'' are made for ceremonial use, and art flags are made for sale.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

===Drapo servis===
[[File:Trop Pou Te Haitian Vodou banners.jpg|thumb|Haitian Vodou drapos. The front flag is for Trop Pou Te.]]
The ''drapo servis'' are important religious icons. 
They are kept in shrine rooms, and carried by flag bearers in elaborate ceremonies in the main chamber of the temple. A ''drapo servis'' will include an image of a Catholic saint or a ''vèvè'' (trace-work emblem) of an ''lwa''{{efn|The ''lwas'' serve as intermediaries between humans and the supreme god.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} }} (spirit) such as [[Papa Legba]] or [[Ogun]] of the [[Yoruba religion]].{{sfn|Cosentino|2013}}
There are many ''lwas'', including [[Erzulie]], [[Guédé]], Damballa and [[La Sirene]].{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} 
The purpose of a ceremonial ''drapo'' is to flatter the ''lwa'' in the hope of gaining favor in return.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} 
Usually ''drapo servis'' are made in pairs, for example representing Ogun and Damballa.
Ogun was the ''lwa'' who led the slaves to freedom, and Damballa is the snake, representing the life force.
Ogun may be paired with other ''lwas''.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

A ''drapo servis'' will have a central image surrounded by a diamond-shaped border, will often have a fringe, and will be {{convert|36|by|36|in}} in size. The image may depict a Catholic saint associated with an ''lwa'' or may be a ''veve'' that represents the ''lwa'' symbolically and provides a gateway for it to enter the world of humans.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
The image may be a [[Chromolithography|chromolithograph]], a vividly colored paper image from Italy, Mexico or Spain of a Catholic saint that has been syncretized with the corresponding African spirit of the drapo.  The image may be an outline of the saint traced from a chromolithograph, or may be a detailed and faithful copy of a chromolithograph in beads and sequins.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}

The most widely used images of saints are those of [[Isidore of Chios|Saint Isidore]], [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James Major]], [[Saint Patrick]] and the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Holy Virgin]].{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}
Veves include the ship of [[Agwé]], the cemetery cross of [[Baron Samedi]], the crossroads of Legba and so on.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=19}}
An image of a mermaid is used on flags for the water spirit [[LaSiren]]. 
This does not derive from ''veve'' or Catholic origins, but seems to have come from European nautical sources.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}
The image of a fish is important in Vodou as in Christian art, but the Vodou symbol comes from [[Fon people|Fon]] mythology rather than Christianity.{{sfn|Desmangles|1992|p=151}}
It represents Agwé, who corresponds to the Fon sea deity Agbê.
Agbê took the shape of a fish when he was given responsibility for the sea.{{sfn|Desmangles|1992|p=152}}

===Art flags===
[[File:VoodooValris.jpg|thumb|Flag by George Valris]]
Art flags show much wider variation in size and theme than ''drapo servis'', and rarely have a fringe. Some flags are closer to tapestries.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
In the 1950s collectors started to buy ''drapo Vodou'', and the ''oungan'' (priests) began to make them for sale as a source of income. 
The next generation of artists, active in the 1990s, included Eviland Lalanne, Joseph Oldof Pierre, Le Petit Frere Mogirus, Wagler Vital, Georges Valris, Roland Rockville, Ronald Gouin, and Antoine Oleyant. They introduced various innovations, in part driven by the shortage of materials for flagmaking. Antoine Oleyant has been called "the artist who really brought the flags into the realm of fine art."{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

In [[Port-au-Prince]] the skilled ''drapo'' artists have ready access to beads and sequins brought in from Canada and the United States. 
These artists earn their living from sales to tourists and to art galleries.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=18}}
In the 21st century there have been considerable changes to ''drapo Vodou'' as an art-form, in which artists such as Myrlande Constant{{efn|Myrlande Constant, born in 1970, was taught seamstress and beading techniques by her mother, and worked in a factory making wedding dresses. She taught herself flagmaking, using beads rather than sequins, and has since become internationally recognized.{{sfn|Ulysse|2011}} }} have introduced new themes and techniques.
Other contemporary ''drapo'' artists include Evelyne Alcide, Roudy Azor, Gabriel Chery, Lindor Chiler, Mireille Delice, Christian Dorleus and Josiane Joseph.
Their large and elaborate ''drapo'' represent in greater details the interactions with the ''lwas'' in events such as Vodou ceremonies and weddings.
They may also represent evangelical Christian themes, or have secular subjects.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} 
Edgard Jean Louis, a well-known flagmaker, made a flag called "Diana Erzulie" that included a photograph of the English [[Princess Diana]].{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
There is growing demand for such ''drapo'' by international art collectors.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}}

==Other objects==
[[File:Haitian vodou altar to Petwo, Rada, and Gede spirits; November 5, 2010..jpg|thumb|Altar to Petwo, Rada, and Gede spirits; 2010]]
In the 1940s Haitian professional artists began to create imitations of images provided by foreign entrepreneurs. The images represented the foreigners' view of the essence of Vodou art. This interaction was later dismissed and the Haitian works were stated to be [[Authenticity in art|authentic]].{{sfn|Richman|2008|p=203}}
In 1949 fifteen artists decorated the Episcopal Saint Trinite Cathedral in Port-au-Prince with murals that contrast Vodou art and traditional scenes from the bible.
Thirteen of the artists were Catholics and/or Vodouists.{{sfn|Thomas|2014|p=190}}
In the 1950s the murals became world famous. African gods were found in the symbolism of Christian images. Thus the "Damballah Virgin" by Andre Dimanche was identified as [[Erzulie]], a lwa connected to Aphrodite, Mater Dolorosa, health and an angry Madonna.{{sfn|Thomas|2014|p=191}}

A doll incorporated in a work of Vodou art can be animated so it can perform supernatural work, protecting the home. The Haitian Vodou priest Georges René explains the process, saying "anything can do mystique if you believe in it... you have to turn it into mystic. You baptize it. You make a ceremony. You put the food the ''lwa'' eats... after that you can work with it. It gets a soul. You can put it on an altar."{{sfn|Apter|Derby|2009|p=357}}

[[Pierrot Barra]] (1942–99) and Marie Cassaise made sacred altar installations from everyday objects such as dolls, sunglasses, sequins, speedometers, rosaries, mirrors and tinsel.{{sfn|Cosentino|1998|p=9}}
Barra said his work was inspired by the Vodou spirits, who sometimes demanded it. He said, "When I sleep, while I'm dreaming, I see the Mysteries. When I sleep I see the spirits...they show me a design, some face, some kind of thing. Then when I wake up I create it."{{sfn|Cosentino|1999|p=16}}
A visitor to Port-au-Prince in 1991 described an altar installation Barra made for the mother goddess [[Ezili Dantor]]. Her head came from a plaster doll, with rouge, lipstick and white synthetic hair. She held a cutout picture of the baby Jesus, which represented the goddess's daughter Anais.{{sfn|Cosentino|1998|p=9}}
A red fabric snake was wrapped round the body of the goddess, and a small rubber baby doll was at the foot of the statue. The whole was decorated with sparkles and cheap jewelry. This was not a traditional design, but was immediately recognized by Vodouists as authentic Vodou art.{{sfn|Cosentino|1998|p=10}}

The '''Halifax Pop Explosion''' is a [[music festival]] and conference that takes place every fall, typically two weeks after [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Thanksgiving]], in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]]. The term "Halifax Pop Explosion" also came to be adopted in the 1990s as the name of the Halifax alternative rock music scene as a whole, which at that time was dominated by [[power pop]] acts such as [[Sloan (band)|Sloan]], [[Jale]], [[The Super Friendz]] and [[Thrush Hermit]].&lt;ref name=havenot&gt;Michael Barclay, Ian A.D.

==History==
[[File:The Bicycles in Halifax, Oct 2012.jpg|thumb|The Bicycles performing in October 2012|345x345px]]Founded in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thescenemagazine.ca/category/halifax-top-news/page/20/ "Halifax Pop Editor’s Picks"]. ''The Scene'' Oct 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the Halifax Pop Explosion has actually been three different events that are now remembered as one long standing event. The original Halifax Pop Explosion, which was operated as private business from 1993–1995, was created as a platform to celebrate Halifax's newfound fame as the "Seattle of the North" and home of Canadian [[grunge]], as well as to promote local bands such as Sloan, [[The Inbreds]], [[Jale]], [[The Super Friendz]] and Thrush Hermit.

The company that organized the festival went out of business and a new organization launched the "Halifax On Music Festival", which ran successfully but not profitably for four years. The festival did not take place in 2000.
In 2001, Waye Mason, a past owner of the Halifax On Music Festival, created the not-for-profit Halifax Pop Explosion Association to operate the festival for the good of the music community, regardless of long term profitability.  The festival name returned to the Halifax Pop Explosion and the event has doubled in size since 2001.  The Festival has expanded its programming to support other genres within the [[independent music]] community as well as the [[power pop]] that it is best known for.  By 2006 it was featuring acts from [[hip hop]] and [[electronica]] to [[folk rock]] and [[alt-country]] to [[punk rock|punk]] and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://exclaim.ca/music/article/halifax_pop_explosion-october_30_to_november_1_-_halifax "Halifax Pop Explosion October 30 to November 1 - Halifax, NS"]. ''Exclaim!'', Jan 01, 2006 by Matt Charlton, Susana Ferreira and Tara Thorne&lt;/ref&gt; With 180 plus bands in 20 venues all around town over five days the festival exhibits considerable breadth in presenting new music.

==2017 Lido Pimienta incident==
A disruption occurred during [[Lido Pimienta]]'s concert at the festival on October 19, 2017. According to a statement that was released by the festival "the incident involved a white volunteer photographer and several white audience members who reacted negatively when Pimienta invited 'brown girls to the front' during her Oct. 19 show" (as reported by [[The Canadian Press]]). When the festival-sanctioned volunteer photographer, who was engaged in documenting the performance, refused to move after ten separate requests Pimienta said, "You're cutting into my set time and you're disrespecting these women, and I don't have time for this". The volunteer was removed from the show and the festival organizers apologized to Pimienta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friend|first1=David|title=Halifax music fest apologizes for 'overt racism' at Lido Pimienta concert|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/halifax-music-fest-apologizes-for-overt-racism-at-lido-pimienta-concert/article36748656/|accessdate=October 27, 2017|work=The Globe and Mail|agency=The Canadian Press|date=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complaint has been filed with the [[Canadian Human Rights Commission]].

==Related events==
In addition to the music, the Halifax Pop Explosion also continues to support a variety of independent arts and pop-culture events.  The Indie Zine and Label Fair, which had been growing since 1996, was replaced in 2006 by three events: the #POPular Conference, a [[Do it yourself|DIY]] and independent music-focused conference; Halifax Zine Fair, the [[Atlantic Canada]] edition of the zine fair and independent publishing event curated by [[Broken Pencil]] Magazine; and a series of art gallery exhibitions stage around town.

The area was also divided into two parts: Poshtkuh and Pishkuh, in the Qajar dynasty. Today, Lorestan is the name of one of the western provinces of Iran.

== Origin ==
There are several disputes over the origin of the Lurs and they are believed to be from the Elamite and Kassite origin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Edwards|first= I.E.S.|last2= Gadd| first2= C.J.|last3= Hammond|first3= G.L.|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|year=1971|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521077910|page=644|url=https://books.google.com/?id=slR7SFScEnwC&amp;dq=elamite+lurs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Potts|first= D.S|title=The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State (Cambridge World Archaeology)|year=1999|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521564960|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mc4cfzkRVj4C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=proto-lurs+elamite}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a Medean or Persian tribe of Aryan origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/iran/lurs-iran |title=The Lurs of Iran |publisher=Cultural Survival |date= |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, nowadays they speak an Iranian language and consider themselves as pure Iranians.
=== Name ===
The first sighting of the word Lur is in the writings of some historians and geographers of the 10th century and later in the form of اللور, اللر and لور (Lur). [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]] in [[Tarikh-i guzida|Tarikh-e gozida]] (1330 AD) referred to the settlement of Lurish tribes in Levant and then their mass migration towards the current Lurish-inhabited areas. There are several hypothesis that discuss the origin of the name Lur or Lor, prominent amongst them is its attribution to a person called Lur or Lohraseb and some believe that the name refers to the area of first settlement of this ethnic group. The word Ler or Lir (literally Forst or forest mountain) is a probable source for this word.&lt;ref&gt;H.Mostawfi. 2000. Tarikhe Gozide (in Persian). Amir Kabir Publications, Tehran&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early History ==
Luristan is mainly a mountainous juicy and lush area with prosperous  pasturages.  There are several dominant tree species like oak, elm, walnut and almond around Luristan.[[File:Cave painting in Doushe cave, Lorstan, Iran, 8th millennium BC.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Cave painting]] in Doushe cave, Lorestan, Iran, 8th millennium BC]]

The ancient history of Lorestan is closely intertwined with the rest of the [[Ancient Near East]]. In the 3rd and 4th millennium BC, migrant tribes settled down in the mountainous area of the Zagros Mountains. The [[Kassites]], an ancient people who spoke neither an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] nor a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]], originated in Lorestān. They would control [[Babylonia]] after the fall of the [[Old Babylonian Empire]] ca. 1531 BC and until ca. 1155 BC.
Iranian [[Medes]] invaded and settled in Luristan in the 2nd millennium BC. The Medes absorbed the indigenous inhabitants of the region, primarily the [[Kassites]] as well as the [[Gutians]], by the time the area was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in the 1st millennium BC.
In February 2017, archeological discoveries related to the [[Achaemenid]] era were made in Lorestan for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.irna.ir/en/News/82418319/ | title=Archeologist: First signs of Achaemenids discovered in Western Iran}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of Aryan settlement in Luristan, precedes more than 1000 years BC. From the Indo-European ethnic groups, first, the Medes settled in areas known as Lorestan. Between 625 and 700 BC, other tribes like the Scythians settled in Lorestan.
=== Elam ===
The first people who ruled areas of Lorestan were Elamites. The extent of the influence of the Elamites has been to the present Mamassani area. They were indigenous peoples of Iran, but there is no proper knowledge of how communities are formed and the beginning of their history. However, They were able to establish a state before the arrival of Aryan ethnic groups in parts of western Iran.&lt;ref name=loor1&gt;{{یادکرد وب| نشانی = http://loor.ir/News.asp?nid=2970&amp;ln=fa| عنوان = آیا لر آریاییست یا عیلامی و کاسی؟| تاریخ بازدید =۱۳ سپتامبر ۲۰۱۴| نویسنده =| تاریخ =۲۶ شهریور ۱۳۸۹| ناشر =نشریه اینترنتی مردم لر| زبان =فارسی| نشانی بایگانی = https://archive.today/Waga| تاریخ بایگانی =۱۳ سپتامبر ۲۰۱۴}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Elam government included Khuzestan, modern Lorestan, Poshtkuh (Ilam provice and some western Iraqi areas), Bakhtiari mountains and Southern Lurish settelment. Babylonians called the land of Elamites Elam or Elamto, meaning "the mountain" and perhaps "the land of sunrise".
Elamite is generally accepted to be a [[language isolate]] and thus unrelated to the much later arriving Persian and Iranic languages. In accordance to geographical and archaeological matching, historians argue that the Elamites to be the Proto-[[Lurs]], whose language became [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] only in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Edwards|first= I.E.S.|last2= Gadd| first2= C.J.|last3= Hammond|first3= G.L.|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|year=1971|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521077910|page=644|url=https://books.google.com/?id=slR7SFScEnwC&amp;dq=elamite+lurs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Potts|first= D.S|title=The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State (Cambridge World Archaeology)|year=1999|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521564960|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mc4cfzkRVj4C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=proto-lurs+elamite#v=onepage&amp;q=proto-lurs%20elamite&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grugni&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grugni | first1 = V | last2 = Battaglia | first2 = V | last3 = Hooshiar Kashani | first3 = B | last4 = Parolo | first4 = S | last5 = Al-Zahery | first5 = N ''et al.

==== Elamite cities ====
The major cities of the Elamites were Shush, Ahvaz, Madakto and Kheidalou. [[Walther Hinz]] believes that the current KhorramAbad in the era of the Elamites was the capital of a dynasty called Simashki.
In the course of several thousand years, the Elamites maintained their identity against strong tribes such as [[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkadians]], [[Babylonians]], and [[Assyrians]].
Eventually, they were defeated by their enemy of Assyria in 654 BC because of internal disputes and wars.
The rise of the Elamites and the formation of the Elamite government in the north of Khuzestan plain is the most important political event of Iran in the third millennium BC. Since then, before the arrival of the Medes and Persians, what we know from the history of the land of Iran is only the political history of Elamite.

=== Kassites ===
Kassites entered to the Iranian plateau from the highlands of the Caucasus and Azerbaijan before the Aryan migration and then settled  the southwest of Iran. Kassites along with Elam, dominated parts of Lorestan and had an extraordinary skill in making bronze artifacts. They were considered as the most important Zagros mountain tribes and were engaged to livestock breeding. They spoke in a language that was affiliated with Elamite.
They were brave and warrior riders and repeatedly entered into battle with their neighbors, including Elamites and Babylonians. They even managed to overthrow the government of Babylon and ruled theBabylon for six centuries. The rule of the Kassites in Babylonia ended as a result of their defeat from the Elamites. After the defeat from the Elamites, they returned to their mountainous land of Lorestan.&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://pardis.150m.com/kassi572.pdf |عنوان =قوم کاسی | ناشر =مهدی رازانی |تاریخ = |تاریخ بازدید =۳ آذر ۱۳۹۱}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد|نویسنده =گرانتوسگی |کتاب =تاریخ ایران از زمان باستان تا امروز| ناشر = تهران |صفحه = |تاریخ =۱۳۴۵}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد|نویسنده =پیگولووسکایا |کتاب =تاریخ ایران از عهد باستان تا قرن ۱۸| ناشر = تهران |صفحه = |تاریخ =۱۳۵۳}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Achaemenids to Sassanids ===
During the rule of Achaemenid, Lorestan was part of the rule of the Kassites and when the Achaemenids moved from Babylon to Hamadan, they had to cross the Lorestan area and pay ransom to the Kassites.&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=4454 |عنوان =جبال (۱) (جمع جَبَل) یا کورة جَبَل یا قُهِستان یا قوهستان (معرّب کوهستان) یا بلاد جبال | ناشر =دانشنامه جهان اسلام |تاریخ = |تاریخ بازدید =۱ ژوئن ۲۰۱۱|زبان=فارسی}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pahle was the name of a vast land in west of Iran which was included many cities and areas in the current Zagros. The province of Pahla was named after the Sasanian times and the word Pahlavi refers to the people, the language, and the alphabet related to the this region. At the time of the Achaemenids, the current Lorestan, along with Ilam and Khuzestan, were the third state of this great empire. During the Parthian period, this land was one of the Satraps (states) of this dynasty anf finally, during the Sassanid period, the area was named "Pahla".&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=2899 |عنوان =پَهلَوی | ناشر =دانشنامه جهان اسلام |تاریخ = |تاریخ بازدید =۱ ژوئن ۲۰۱۱|زبان=فارسی}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Islamic era ==
In spite of several resistance efforts, the Arab conquest of Iran, led to the end of the Sasanid Empire in 651 and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Iran. Iran (including Lurish territory) was under the absolute sovereignty of Arabs for two centuries. Lur people, however, managed to maintain the language and many of their customs. Until the end of the third century AH, the district of Lorestan paid the taxes to Kufa and was directly governed by the Caliphs. Different free-seeking revolts led to gradual reestablishment of Iranian local dynasties in the beginning of the ninth century.
After the Arab dominance, Luristan was under control of [[Hasanwayhids]], [[Buyids]] and [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqids]], respectively.

By the middle of the tenth century, the total Lurish-inhabited areas were known as Luristan. Along with the gradual weakening of Seljuks, several autonomous atabeg were formed across Iran. Luristan Atabegs or Hazaraspids established an autonomous state in the Lurish-inhabited areas. After that, the territory was divided into two parts: Lur-e-kuchek (Minor Luristan) and Lur-e-bozorg (Major Luristan). The former corresponded to modern Luristan and Ilam provinces and some areas in the current western Iraq while the latter included modern Bakhtiari, Kuhgiluye-Boir Ahmed, Mamasani and some coastal areas in Bushehr. In spite of all these invasions, the Lurs maintained their territorial integrity, absorbed the invaders, and eventually established two local dynasties known as Atabak or Atabeg during the twelfth century.
Hazaraspids (Atabaks of Luristan) is the name of Lur dynasty that ruled a large area of Iran for a long while (1148–1424). Their territory included almost all the current Lurish-inhabited regions. Luristan Atabeg then divided in two Atabegs; the Minor Luristan (Lore kučak) and the Major Luristan (Lore bozorg) with Khorram Abad and Idaj as their capitals, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hazaraspids |عنوان =هزاراسپیان | ناشر =دانشنامه ایرانیکا |تاریخ  = |تاریخ بازدید =‎۶ آبان ۱۳۸۹|زبان=انگلیسی}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lor-e-Bozorg (Major Luristan) ===
A big  part of the Lurish areas came under the control of a local dynasty known as Lur-e bozorg Atabegs during the twelfth century. It was established in 1155 AD. The area under the control of major Luristan rulers (modern Bakhtiari, Kuhgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmed, Mamasani and parts of Khuzistan, Bushehr and Isfahan provinces) was included a vast territory extending from the Dez River in the north Khuzistan to the central areas of [[Fars province|Fars]] in the southern Iran. In spite of evidences indicating the economic and social proserity, the Atabak dynasty finally extinct by [[Ibrahim Sultan ibn Shahrukh]] invasion in 1423. As a result, the territorial unity and the economic prosperity of the Major Luristan was terminated. The territory was divided into tribal sectins without a centralized coherence. During the Safavid period (1501–1750), Major Luristan was divided into three parts: the northern part became known as [[Bkhtiari people|Bakhtiari]], the central part as [[Kuhgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmad|Kuhgilu]], and the southern part as [[Mamasani County|Mamasani]].

=== Lor-e-Kuchek (Minor Luristan) ===
Traditionally the Minor Luristan corresponded to current provinces of Luristan and Ilam and some Feyli-inhabited areas in Iraq (belt of mountainous region stretching from the plains of the Tigris in the west to the Diz River in the east).Shojaeddin Khorshid establshed the dynasty as the Atabakan-i-Luristan, which lasted from 1184 to 1597. The rulers established their capital in Khorramabad (currently the provincial capital of [[Luristan province]].

==== Lurish Walies dynasty ====
The Atabak dynasty was replaced by the Wali dynasty (1596–1929). The founder of the new dynasty was Husain Khan, whose father had married the aunt of the last Atabak, and on the basis of this kinship tie Husain Khan later received the position of ruler of Lur-j-kuchek. The Walis played a significant role in the political affairs of Iran. They guarded southwestern Iran against the Ottomans, who constantly attacked the western and southwestern borders of the country. Ali Mardan Khan was appointed the commander-in-chief of the entire Iranian armed forces dur downfall of the Safavids, when the country was invaded by the Afghans in the early eighteenth century (De Bode 1845).

The reign of the Walis coincided with several dynasties of Iran including: Safavid (1501–1736), Afshar (1736–1750), Zand (1750–1794), Qajar (1796–1925) and the beginning of the Pahlavi(1924–1929). The last two dynasties, namely the Qajar and Pahlavi, are responsible for the political weakness of the Lurs and the decline of the Wali dynasty. Thus, the Lurs maintained their political integrity under the Safavids and Afshars, while they ruled over Iran during the Zand dynasty. However, when the Qajars came to power, they divided Lur-i-kuchek into two parts, Luristan and Posht-kuh. From this time on, the domain of the Walis was limited to Posht-kuh only, while Luristan came under the direct control of the central government. Thus, a governor-general, usually a member of the royal family, was appointed by the king and sent to Luristan. Yet during the Qajar dynasty, Luristan was continually in a state of anarchy. The Qajars were unable to subdue the tribes of Luristan and hence, except for some short periods, there was no peace in Luristan. As a matter of fact, the Qajar dynasty lost total control over Luristan after the assassination of Nasir al-Din Shah in 1896. In short, the division of Lur-i-kuchek by the Qajar dynasty weakened the political strength of the Walis and reduced the Lurs' political influence. Furthermore, the inability of the Qajars to establish law and order in Luristan contributed to the expansion of pastoral nomadism and the destruction of settled communities. Consequently, Luristan suffered politically as well as economically under Qajar rule.

The Qajar dynasty was overthrown by Reza Khan, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty, in 1925. The Pahlavi dynasty (1925–1979) is best characterized as a dictatorial monarchy with absolute rule, that is, the concentration of power in the monarch's hands. The regime built an army whose strength was without precedent in the history of Iran. The army was used against Lurs and other groups who refused to give up their power to the new regime. Through bloody confrontations between the new monarch and the Lurs (as well as other peoples in Iran), the Pahlavi dynasty eventually crushed the powers of the Lurs. Thus, Reza Shah ended the Wali dynasty of Posht-kuh, executed or exiled many of the Lur leaders, forcefully sedentarized the nomadic pastoral tribes and changed the territorial integrity of Lur-i-kuchek.

== Modern history ==
=== The Lurs under the Pahlavi Regime ===

While the Qajar dynasty was responsible for the spread of anarchy among the Lurs, the Pahlavi-dynasty was responsible for their political disorganization, social disruption and the loss of political freedom and semi-independent status. For the first time in their long history, the Lurs were stripped of their traditional rights and political freedom by the Pahlavi dynasty. When Reza Shah took power, he established a centralized government, transferring power from the provincial communities to Tehran. He carried out his plan through the use of military operations against various provincial communities, including the Lurs. A key element to Reza Shah's success was that the Lurs were not unified so he could attack each group separately. Furthermore, Reza Shah used one tribe to fight against another. As the Lurs were defeated, Reza Shah took the following measures to keep them under control: 1) tribal leaders were removed from their positions of authority and were replaced by military officials, 2) many of the leaders, were executed, imprisoned or exiled to other parts of Iran, 3) some tribes were exiled to distant lands, 4) all pastoral nomadic tribes, which formed the majority of the Lur population, were forceably sedentarized without sufficient provisions, 5) all tribesmen were disarmed, 6) the use of the traditional black tent was outlawed, 7) tribesmen were ordered to abandon their traditional costume and were forced to wear Western clothes; however, this rule was not totally carried out, and 8) governmental offices were established in order to carry out the state policies.

The above policies were intended to subjugate the Lurs to the central government. Reza Shah altered the traditional sociopolitical organization of the Lurs without providing opportunities for their participation in local or national government. Undoubtedly the establishment of the central state demanded the integration of various regions and ethnic groups. However, that need not entail political deprivation and the lack of respect for members of the different tribal or ethnic groups. Under the Pahlavi regime, however, the establishment of the modern state came to mean precisely that – the expansion of state domination and disruption of the traditional political organization without the slightest opportunity for peoples to participate in local or national politics.

Reza Shah was deposed by the British and Russians in 1941, and was replaced by his son Mohammed Reza Shah, who ruled from 1941 to 1979. The reign of Mohammed Reza Shah witnessed further centralization of state power and the disintegration of traditional political organization among the Lurs. The enforcement of the land reform program and the nationalization of the forests and pastureland (1962–63 along with various forces of modernization including the expansion of capitalism, urbanism and modern schooling gradually changed many aspects of the Lurs' culture.

Under the Pahlavi regime, the Lurs lost their freedom and their semi-independent status, and the Lurs' territories were divided into several administrative units without any regard for traditional boundaries. For instance, Lur-i-kuchek has been limited to modern Luristan while Posht-kuh, formerly ruled by the Wali dynasty, was incorporated into Ilam province. The most dramatic change caused by the Pahlavi regime was the loss of freedom and the semi-independent status of the Lurs. Prior to the establishment of the Pahlavi Regime, basic decisions were made within the local communities. For instance, the Bakhtiari was ruled by a local dynasty who paid certain tributes to the central government, while internal affairs were taken care of by the members of that dynasty. In Luristan, each tribal group acted as a semi-independent unit. In Posht-kuh, the Walis were supreme, while the tribes of Kuh-Gilu-Boir Ahmed and those of Mamasani also enjoyed the same internal freedom. The Pahlavi regime, however, sent high-ranking officials from Tehran to supervise the Lur territories. Just prior to the recent revolution, all governors-general were directly appointed by the Shah without taking into consideration the existence of the Lurs' communities. Lurs, like other Iranians, were prohibited from organizing political parties, forming associations or expressing themselves through mass media and public gatherings.

Second, Iranian oil is extracted from the mountain slopes of Luristan, Bakhtiari and Kuh-Gilu-Boir Ahmed provinces, but the Lurs were deprived from their share of oil revenue, particularly during the reign of Mohammed Reza Shah. The money derived from oil went to the pockets of the Tehranis, creating regional economic inequalities.

Third, despite the fact that the Pahlavi regime provided elementary and, to some extent, secondary education for the Lurs, it failed to provide them with opportunities for higher education. Until a few years prior to the revolution, not a single institution of higher education was established among the Lurs, nor were they given scholarships or financial support. The Pahlavi regime was thus responsible for depriving the Lurs of access to higher and prestigious positions. High-ranking Lur families were the only exceptions; they could afford to send their children to universities either in Iran or outside the country.

Modern education was used during the Pahlavi rule as a way to undermine local cultural values. School curriculum was prepared in Tehran without taking the cultural diversity among the Iranian peoples into consideration. Not a single course in the entire elementary, high school or university curricula reflected the history, geography or sociocultural values of the Lurs.

In sum, the Lurs lost their sociopolitical integrity under the Pahlavi dynasty. They were integrated into the "modern" state without any opportunity for effective participation in the decision-making process that affected their lives.

=== The Lurs under the Islamic Regime ===

It is too early to evaluate the sociopolitical conditions of the Lurs under the present regime. So far, political parties, associations and local newspapers have not yet emerged. Administrative boundaries of the Lurs' territories remain unchanged from those of the Pahlavi regime. While it is difficult to speculate about the future of the Lurs under the current regime, considering the fact that the present regime is concerned more with an Islamic community rather than with a country of diverse ethnic groups, it seems unlikely that there will be considerable change in the near future.

[[File:HorseBrassDisplayBedfordMuseum.JPG|thumb|Display of English brasses]]
A '''horse brass''' is a brass plaque used for the decoration of [[horse harness]] gear, especially for [[shire horse|shire]] and parade horses. They became especially popular in England from the mid-19th century until their general decline alongside the use of the [[draft horse]], and remain a collectors item today.  

'''Phalera''' is the archaeological term for equivalent disks, which were popular in [[Iron Age Europe]], including Ancient Rome. 

==History==
[[Image:Horsebrass.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A modern souvenir horse brass featuring [[Gloucester cathedral]]]]
In ancient Rome, horse harnesses were sometimes embellished with horse brasses known as ''phalerae'', normally in [[bronze]], cut or cast in the shape of a boss, disk, or crescent, most often used in pairs on a harness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Phalera.html Phalera], [[James Yates (minister)|James Yates]], M.A., F.R.S., on p. 894 of William Smith, D.C.L., LL.D.: A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, John Murray, London, 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval England, decorative horse brasses were in use before the 12th century, serving as [[talisman]]s and status symbols, but extensive, original research by members of the National Horse Brass Society has shown that there is no connection whatsoever between these bronze [[amulet]]s to the working-class harness decorations used in the mid-19th century which developed as part of a general flowering of the decorative arts following the [[Great Exhibition]]. 

There are a great deal of die-hard, unfounded myths surrounding these decorations such as their usage as amulets to ward off the "[[evil eye]]". The most popular size is 3 × 3½ inches of flat brass with a hanger by which the brass is threaded onto a horse harness strap, known as a [[Martingale (tack)|Martingale]]. In England many of these items of harness found their way into country public houses as the era of the heavy horse declined, and are still associated today as a pub decoration. By the late 19th century heavy horses were decorated with brasses of all kinds and sizes. During this era working horse parades were popular throughout the British Isles and prize or merit awards were given, some by the [[Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (RSPCA). Horse brasses were often highly prized by the "[[Carting business|carters]]", who decorated their horse with them. Other horse brass subjects include advertising, royalty commemoration, and in later years, souvenir brasses for places and events, many of which are still being made and used today.

==Collection==
Collecting horse brasses for their own sake other than as decorations for harness seems to have commenced around 1880, when women bought the newly issued, pierced-design, die-struck brasses which were used for pin-cushions. A little later these were often used as fingerplates on doors which can be corroborated by accounts in the trade magazine, ''Saddler and Harness'' by the veteran saddler William Albery or Horsham in Sussex. From 1890 onward, collecting the various types of brass, i.e. face-pieces, swingers, and hame-plates, etc., became a highly popular pastime amongst the upper and middle classes. Indeed, the collecting of these humble brasses became especially popular amongst academics with many famous, early collections being formed by public schoolmasters and other prominent professionals, such as A.H. Tod,&lt;ref&gt;Horse Brass Collections No. 1 (1944) Henry Devonshire, Birmingham&lt;/ref&gt; a Master at Charterhouse School and Dr Kirk of Pickering in Yorkshire, whose collection is still housed at the [[York Castle Museum]] in York. The writing about such items also commenced c.1890s and was dominated by much Victorian romanticism surrounding the supposed, esoteric origin and ancient, unbroken lineage of these decorations. Such myths include their origin as talismanic symbols being brought back to England by homecoming knights returning from the [[Crusades]], or in later years, by migrating [[romani people|romany]], though, once again, absolutely no evidence has ever been offered in support of these theories.

===Cast brasses===
Whatever the views of individual collectors as to when or where working-horse harness decoration first began in the British Isles, most collectors agree that cast brasses were the first to appear on the scene. Opinion is also still divided as to how, even these, originated, but once again, most collectors nowadays, are in agreement that the earliest decorations were simple, cast studs in a variety of shapes and sizes. The earliest types were probably even made locally by smiths or other skilled artisans but by the second half of the 19th century the production of such things had evolved from a local, decorative cult into a national fashion with the bulk of their production centred in and around the West Midlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalhorsebrasssociety.org.uk National Horse Brass Society, UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stamped brasses===

Stamped brasses on heavy horse harness appeared on the scene around 1880, with a small number occurring perhaps a decade or so earlier, and it is highly likely that the process developed from one that was already established in the manufacture of carriage harness trappings and military insignia. However, production of these appears to have peaked shortly before the [[First World War]], and since the 1920s, a few types have been produced but their quality is rather poor being made from thinner gauge brass sheet. Due to serious considerations of the sheer weight of cast harness decorations carried by working horses (first raised by the early animal welfare movements in the late 19th century) it is thought that the first stamped brasses were made as a lighter (and cheaper), alternative to cast brasses being later exported throughout the British Empire. Unlike their cast cousins, stamped brasses were not made in moulds, but pressed out of rolled sheet brass approximately 1/16 in thickness although other gauges of sheet than earlier examples. Due to the ease of their manufacture, many thousands of these stamped types were produced, but there are some that are very rare.

The production of both cast and stamped brasses has continued since the demise of the British working horse but their manufacture is mainly centred on the souvenir trade, and other specialist manufacturers who provide for the heavy horse world who still breed and show the various breeds.

The National Horse Brass Society of England has members all over the world and provides publications for members and swap meets.

The burning of '''incense in Japan''' began during the 6th century (the [[Asuka period]]) with the introduction of [[Buddhism]], which uses incense during rituals and ceremonies. [[Agarwood]] was imported into Japan from China via Korea.  From that point on, [[incense]] would become an important facet of [[Japanese culture]]. Incense is used for a variety of purposes, including Buddhist ceremonies, spirituality and meditation.

There are two major types of incense in Japan, which are either heating or smouldering small pieces of fragrant wood, or direct-burning incense in form of sticks or cones formed out of paste without a bamboo stick.

Many of the current incense companies have been in existence for more than 300 years.

==Etymology==
{{unsourced section|date=March 2017}}
The word incense (''kō'') in Japan is written in the Chinese [[Kangxi radical|Kangxi]] [[radical 186]] composed of nine strokes, 香, which can also be expanded up to 27 strokes 馫. A literal translation is "fragrance", though in context it is understood as "incense".  The word 道 ''dō'' may be added, which means "way", both literally (street) and metaphorically (a stream of life experience), to give [[#Kōdō|kōdō]]: the "way of incense", which involves using incense within a structure of codified conduct.

==History==
{{ref improve|section|date=March 2017}}
[[File:ch5 wakamurasaki.jpg|thumb|Fragrant scent played an important role at court during the Heian period (image from [[The Tale of Genji]] by Tosa Mitsuoki, 1617–91.)]]

''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', a book of classical Japanese history, gives the first formal record of incense in Japan when a log of [[agarwood]], a fragrant wood used in incense burning, drifted ashore on [[Awaji Island]]  during the [[Asuka period]] in 595 CE, and was presented to [[Prince Shōtoku]] and the [[Empress Suiko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dQ6KQMLQ_rEC&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=31|title=The Book of Incense: Enjoying the Traditional Art of Japanese Scents|author= Kiyoko Morita|publisher=Kodansha International|date= 30 Oct 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shōtoku knew of incense burning from [[Buddhism]], which had been introduced into Japan around 538 CE; incense was part of Buddhist ritual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xdVkzs6iI1YC&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=159|title=The Trail of Time: Time Measurement with Incense in East Asia|author= Silvio A. Bedini|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date= 24 Mar 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was imported into Japan from China through Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dQ6KQMLQ_rEC&amp;pg=PA32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=32-33|title=The Book of Incense: Enjoying the Traditional Art of Japanese Scents|author= Kiyoko Morita|publisher=Kodansha International|date= 30 Oct 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agarwood was imported in 538 CE during the building of a temple. A ritual known as ''sonaekō'' became established. ''Koboku'' fragrant wood combined with herbs and other aromatic substances was burned to provide a fragrant incense for religious purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanese-incense.com/sonaeko.htm|title=Buddhist Incense-Sonae-ko|work=japanese-incense.com|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom of burning incense was further developed and blossomed amongst the court nobility with the pastime of ''takimono'', a powdered mixture of aromatic substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/shi/igj/igj03.htm|title=In Ghostly Japan|work=sacred-texts.com|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fragrant scents played a vital role at court life during the [[Heian period]], robes and even fans were perfumed and poems written about them, it also featured prominently in the epic [[The Tale of Genji]] in the 11th century. 

Samurai warriors would prepare for battle by purifying their minds and bodies with the incense of ''koboku''; developing an appreciation for its fragrances. In the late [[Muromachi period]] in the 16th century, this aesthetic awareness would develop into the accomplishment known as kōdō, which is the art of enjoying the incense of smouldering ''koboku''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jinc/hd_jinc.htm|title=Japanese Incense – Essay – Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History – The Metropolitan Museum of Art|first=Author: Monika|last=Bincsik|work=metmuseum.org|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present style of kōdō has largely retained the structure and manner of the Muromachi period, in which time the [[Japanese Tea Ceremony|tea ceremony]] and the ''[[ikebana]]'' style of flower arrangement developed as well.

During the [[Tenshō (Momoyama period)|Tenshō era]] in the late 16th century, the master craftsmen Kōju was employed at the [[Kyoto Imperial Palace]] and practiced incense ceremony. The third Kōju served under [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], the fourth under [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. The eighth Kōju Takae Jyuemon was known as a particular master of incense of note.  
During this time the “Ten Virtues of Kō” (香の十徳, ''kōnojūtoku'') were formulated, which is a traditional listing of the benefits derived from the proper and correct use of quality incense:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nipponkodo.com/en/culture/virtues.html |title=The Ten Virtues of Koh|publisher=Nippon Kodo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.komori-corp.co.jp/knowledge/2013/03/post-2.html|title=Virtues of Koh|publisher=Komori-Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://viennaimports.com/blog/articles/incense-around-world|title=Incense Around The World|publisher=Vienna Imports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# 感格鬼神 : Sharpens the senses
# 清浄心身 : Purifies the body and the spirit
# 能払汚穢 : Eliminates pollutants
# 能覚睡眠 : Awakens the spirit
# 静中成友 : Heals loneliness
# 塵裏愉閑 : Calms in turbulent times
# 多而不厭 : Is not unpleasant, even in abundance
# 募而知足 : Even in small amounts is sufficient
# 久蔵不朽 : Does not break down after a very long time
# 常用無障 : A common use is not harmful

Even today, there is a strong relationship and holistic approach in kōdō between fragrant scent, the senses, the human spirit, and nature. The spirituality and refined concentration that is central to kōdō places it on the same level as kadō and chadō.

The start of the [[Edo period]] in the 19th century saw major changes in the history and production of incense. Senkō incense sticks became more widely available to the general public as production method shifted to an industrial scale. At the start of the 20th century, mainichi-kō, or "everyday incense" was developed by the master craftsman Kitō Yujiro during the Meiji and [[Taishō era]]. 

Today companies such as [[Nippon Kodo]], [[Shoyeido]], and [[Baieido]] are some of the most established suppliers for incense.

== Material ==
{{unsourced section|date=March 2017}}

The fragrant woods [[agarwood]] and [[sandalwood]] are the main ingredients used in Japanese incense. Agarwood is produced in certain parts of southeast Asia such as Vietnam. Japanese incense companies divide agarwood into six categories depending on the region obtained and properties of the agarwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://making-incense.com/kodo/rikkoku.htm |title=The Rikkoku – Traditional Japanese Classifications of Aloeswood used for Kodo |accessdate=2008-01-31 |work=Making-Incense.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trees secrete an aromatic resin, which over time turns into kōboku.  One particular grade of kōboku with a high oil content and superior fragrance is called kyara. Kyara is currently worth more than its weight in gold. Sandalwood originates primarily from India, Indonesia, southern China or other parts of southeast Asia. Sandalwood trees need around 60 years to produce their signature fragrance that can be deemed acceptable to be used for kōdo. The most valued sandalwood comes from [[Mysore]] in the state of [[Karnataka]] in India, where it is endangered. Makkō (which translates as "incense powder") is used to bind the ingredients together.  It is able to bind ingredients while having little scent of its own.

Other materials used are [[cinnamon bark]], [[chebulic myrobalan]], [[clove]], [[Hedychium|ginger lily]], [[lavender]], [[licorice]], [[patchouli]], [[nardostachys jatamansi|spikenard]], [[camomile]], [[rhubarb]], [[safflower]], [[star anise]], and other [[herbs]]. [[Exoskeleton|Shell]] fragrances and other animal-derived aromatic materials are also used. 

[[File:RanJyaTai Shosoin.JPG|thumb|''Ranjyatai'', a historical ''kyara'' wood dating to the 10th century CE, kept at the [[Shōsōin]] treasury in Nara]]

Raw materials such as agarwood are becoming increasingly rare due to the depletion of the wild resource. This has made prime material very expensive. For example, the cost of lower grade ''kyara'' is about 20,000 yen per gram. Top quality ''kyara'' costs over 40,000 yen per gram, or many times the equivalent weight of gold (as of late 2012). If the particular piece of incense wood has a history, the price can be even higher. The highest regarded wood, ranjyatai, dates back to at least the 10th century and is ''kyara'' wood from Laos or Vietnam, and was used by emperors and warlords for its fragrance. It is said to contain so much resin that it can be used many times over. The wood is kept at the [[Shōsōin]] treasury in Nara, which is under the administration of the Imperial Household.  The high costs and difficulty in obtaining acceptable raw material is one of the reasons why kōdō is not as widely practised or known compared to the art of flower arrangement or the tea ceremony.

==Types of incense==
[[Sasaki Dōyō]] (1306–1373), who was regarded as a paragon of elegance and luxury and the quintessential military aristocrat during [[Nanboku-chō period]], owned many incense woods and named them.

''[[Shōgun]]'' [[Ashikaga Yoshimasa]] (1436–1490) himself appreciated precious scented woods and collected some or inherited them from Sasaki. In order to properly organise the large collection of incense wood, he appointed the experts of that time Sanjonishi Sanetaka, who became the founder of the Oie School, and Shino Soshin, the founder of the Shino School. They established a classifying system called ''rikkoku gomi'', which means "six countries, five scents".

==Incense makers==
{{unsourced section|date=March 2017}}

One of the oldest traditional incense companies in Japan is [[Baieido]], founded in 1657 with roots going back to the Muromachi period. Other traditional and still operating companies include Kyukyodo (1663, Kyoto), and [[Shoyeido]], founded in 1705 in Kyoto. [[Nippon Kodo]] is also a major supplier of incense material.

Both Baieido and Shoyeido are used extensively by Zen Buddhist temples, both in Japan and worldwide. [[Nippon Kodo|Nippon Kōdō]] was established by incorporation in New York City in August 1965 and is the largest seller of Japanese incense worldwide. Most of their incense is "everyday" quality (毎日 mainichi). They do make some "traditional" incense as well. These three are the major exporters of Japanese incense.

Currently, 70% of all of Japan's incense is manufactured on a small island south of Osaka called Awaji Island. The history extends back to 1850 in Ei of the city of Awaji in 1850 when Senshuu Sakai manufacturing technology was introduced. At the time, Ei was a military run trade port for the Tokushima Clan, which opened the door to the import and sale of raw materials used in making incense. Over time, the incense made in Awaji Island became renowned throughout Japan. The main reason incense manufacturing took root in Awaji Island is because of its nishi-kaze (west wind). This strong seasonal wind hampers the fishing industry, giving rise to the necessity for cottage industries such as incense making. This wind is also great for drying incense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov-online.go.jp/eng/publicity/book/hlj/html/201202/201202_13.html|title=Scent of Awaji
|publisher=gov-online.go.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kyūkyodō, Kunmeidō, and Kōkandō also sell some incense overseas. It may be difficult to find the other brands outside Japan. There are numerous other incense makers in Japan, of course.  These are the either the major sellers or the oldest companies in Japan.

==''Kōdō''==
[[File:香道 (1).JPG|thumb|A set of utensils used for incense ceremony]]
{{main|Kōdō}}
''Kōdō'' ({{nihongo|香道|Way of Incense}}) is the [[Japanese art]] of appreciating incense, similar to the [[tea ceremony]], in which participants follow established practises involving the preparation and enjoyment of incense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.gaijinpot.com/kodo-the-way-of-incense/|work=gaijinpot.com|title=Kodo: the Way of Incense|author=Jessica Sayuri Boissy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is counted as one of the three classical arts of refinement, it is relatively unknown amongst modern Japanese people.{{fact|date=March 2017}}  Kōdō includes all aspects of the incense process – from the tools ({{nihongo||香道具|''kōdōgu''}}), which, much like tools of the tea ceremony, are valued as high art, to activities such the incense-comparing games kumikō and genjikō. 

For kumikō,  participants sit near one another and take turns smelling incense from a [[censer]] as they pass it around the group. Participants comment on and make observations about the incense, and play games to guess the incense material. Genjikō is one such game, in which participants are to determine which of five prepared censers contain different scents, and which contain the same scent. Players' determinations (and the actual answers) are recorded using ''genji-mon'' linear patterns, the elements of which allude to chapters in the ''[[Tale of Genji]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|Japan Encyclopedia|page=237|plainurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from kōdō, incense can also be used during the tea ceremony or other functions. A variety of containers and censers, or [[kōro]], made out of porcelain, wood, lacquer or other materials were created over the centuries for this purpose, such as [[kōgō]], and [[kōbako]], all of which can be supremely valuable items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Exhibition of Kôgô: Japanese Ceramic Incense Boxes from the George Clemenceau Collection|author= Asahi Shinbusha|date= 1978|publisher=The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khaled Akil''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] '''خالد عقيل''') is a Syrian [[Fine-art photographer]] and mixed media artist, born in [[Aleppo]] city, his work focuses primarily on critiquing war, religion and social turmoil in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=NYTIMES&gt;{{cite news|title=Lives|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/20/magazine/the-identity-thief.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Khaled AKil-Biography|url=http://home.fotofest.org/exhibitions/2015/internationaldiscoveriesv/akil.aspx#.VmwS-Up97IU|website=Fotofest.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his controversial topics pointing out taboos in Islamic and Middle Eastern societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MRS.DEANE DREAMING: KHALED AKIL|url=http://www.beikey.net/mrs-deane/?p=7435|website=beikey.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Khaled Akil was born in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]],&lt;ref name="AJ"&gt;{{cite news|title=Artist Khaled Akil imagines Pokémon Go in ravaged Syria|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/artist-khaled-akil-imagines-pokmon-ravaged-syria-160722172024059.html|agency=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a family with a long history of artistic and political influence. His father is the renowned painter Youssef Akil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.janetradyfineart.com/artist/Khaled_Akil/biography/|website=janetradyfineart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His great maternal grandfather is the Syrian author and historical figure [[Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi]].

Khaled’s first exhibition was held in 2009, when at the time he was completing his bachelor's degree in Law.&lt;ref name=NYTIMES /&gt; His experience in law, politics and human rights played a major role in his artistic development and projections. Most of his works deal with topics related to the social, political, and religious discrepancies he witnessed around the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHOTOGRAPHY. BEHIND SYRIA’S WAR|url=http://www.freearabs.com/index.php/photo-gallery-page-art/jb-span-photography-jb-span-behind-syria-s-war#!1|website=freearabs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he held a solo exhibition “The Legend of Death”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAREWELL IS NOT GOOD-BYE|url=http://www.mantlethought.org/arts-and-culture/farewell-not-good-bye|website=mantlethought.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Istanbul, where he resides today&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web|title=You Need to Be Looking at 'Pokémon Go in Syria'|url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/pokemon-go-in-syria-photographs-isis|website=The Creator Project.Vice}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the escalation of the war in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Middle East's managing editor caught up with celebrated Syrian artist Khaled Akil who currently resides in Istanbul. |url=http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/features/qa-with-Syrian-artist-khaled-akil_15437 |website=yourmiddleeast.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021030126/http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/features/qa-with-syrian-artist-khaled-akil_15437 |archivedate=2015-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technic ==
His work is a hybrid of photography and painting, with a digital final product.  various layers, created in direct relation with the photographic work and the issue presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INTERVIEW: KHALED AKIL|url=http://www.artfridge.de/2014/02/interview-with-khaled-akil.html|website=artfridge.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What one sees when looking into Akil's images is a dual universe wherein creatures and symbols merge with the visual fragments of war and abandonment.

Khaled Akil subjects his original photographs to countless layers of manual intervention that ultimately result in digital prints. With their mixture of photography, painting, and sometimes Arabic calligraphy, the dense surfaces of the works make them expressive and strongly palpable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1828">In [[mathematics]], the '''Laplace limit''' is the maximum value of the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] for which a solution to Kepler's equation, in terms of a power series in the eccentricity, converges. It is approximately

: 0.66274 34193 49181 58097 47420 97109 25290.

[[Kepler's equation]] ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''E''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;ε&amp;nbsp;sin&amp;nbsp;''E'' relates the [[mean anomaly]] ''M'' with the [[eccentric anomaly]] ''E'' for a body moving in an [[ellipse]] with eccentricity&amp;nbsp;ε. This equation cannot be solved for ''E'' in terms of [[elementary function]]s, but the [[Lagrange reversion theorem]] gives the solution as a [[power series]] in&amp;nbsp;ε:

:&lt;math&gt; E = M + \sin(M) \, \varepsilon + \tfrac12 \sin(2M) \, \varepsilon^2 + \left( \tfrac38 \sin(3M) - \tfrac18 \sin(M) \right) \, \varepsilon^3 + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

[[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] realized that this series converges for small values of the eccentricity, but diverges for any value of ''M'' other than a multiple of π if the eccentricity exceeds a certain value that does not depend on ''M''. The Laplace limit is this value. It is the [[radius of convergence]] of the power series.

It is given by the solution to the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x\exp(\sqrt{1+x^2})}{1+\sqrt{1+x^2}}=1&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4627">The [[Mayan languages]] are a family of languages spoken by the [[Maya people]]. The Maya form a group of approximately 7 million people descendant from an ancient Mesoamerican civilization and spread across the modern-day countries of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. They speak descendant languages from their original Proto-Mayan language, and some of their languages were recorded in the form of glyphs of a [[Mayan script]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="66923">'''Music recording certifications''' are typically awarded by the global [[music industry]] based on the total units sold, streamed, or shipped to retailers. These awards and their requirements are defined by the various [[Music recording sales certification|certifying]] bodies representing the music industry in various countries and territories worldwide. The standard certification awards given consist of Gold, Platinum, and sometimes Diamond awards, in ascending order; the UK also has a Silver certification, ranking below Gold. In most cases, a "Multi-Platinum" or "Multi-Diamond" award is given for multiples of the Platinum or Diamond requirements.

Many music industries around the world are represented by the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI). The IFPI operates in 66 countries and services affiliated industry associations in 45 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_about/index.html
 | accessdate = 2010-05-18
 | publisher = [[IFPI]]
 | title = IFPI's Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the IFPI is merely affiliated with the already operational certification bodies of a country, but in many others countries with lesser-developed industries, the IFPI acts as the sole certifying body servicing the country or region's music industry. Still other countries not represented by the IFPI have certifying bodies operating independently, such as individual record companies which service the country or region's music industry as a whole.

Though all certifying bodies give awards for [[album]] sales or shipments, many also certify [[Single (music)|singles]], paid [[Music download|digital download]]s, [[music video]]s, music [[DVD]]s, and [[Audio mastering|master]] [[ringtone]]s. Additionally, some certifying bodies have separate threshold scales for works of domestic or international origins, varying genres, lengths, and formats. From the 2010s digital streaming was included in some territories.

[[File:Lontong sayur.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Lontong dekem]]
'''Lontong dekem''' is one of the specialties of [[Indonesia]]. [[Lontong]] dekem is also called as dekem [[rice cake]]. Dekem rice cake originated from [[Pemalang Regency]]. The process involves soaking the rice cake in water until it is submerged hence the name "dekem" meaning "immersion" in Pemalang district.&lt;ref name="JatengTime"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lintas.me/go/jatengtime.com/hangatnya-lontong-dekem khas-pemalang|title=Hangatnya Lontong Dekem Pemalang |accessdate=7 April 2014 |publisher=JatengTime.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ingredients of lontong dekem consist of sliced rice cake, yellow watery gravy and fried onion, [[serundeng]], and crackers. Dekem rice cake is also served with duck meat mixture. Dekem common rice cake is served with chicken [[satay]]. There are two variants of satay chicken; fried and stewed satay sauce.&lt;ref name="JatengTime" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9741">The term ''metafunction'' originates in [[systemic functional linguistics]] and is considered to be a property of all languages. [[Systemic functional linguistics]] is functional and semantic rather than formal and syntactic in its orientation. As a functional linguistic theory, it claims that both the emergence of grammar and the particular forms that grammars take should be explained “in terms of the functions that language evolved to serve”.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1994. "Systemic Theory". In R.E. Asher (ed) ''Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics'', Vol 8. Pergamon Press. Reprinted in full in Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. ''On Language and Linguistics: Volume 3 in the ''Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday''. London: Continuum p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; While languages vary in how and what they do, and what humans do with them in the contexts of human cultural practice, all languages are considered to be shaped and organised in relation to three functions, or metafunctions. [[Michael Halliday]], the founder of systemic functional linguistics, calls these three functions the ''ideational'', ''interpersonal'', and ''textual''. The ideational function is further divided into the ''experiential'' and ''logical''.

Metafunctions are ''systemic clusters''; that is, they are groups of semantic systems that make meanings of a related kind. The three metafunctions are mapped onto the structure of the clause. For this reason, systemic linguists analyse a clause from three perspectives. Halliday argues that the concept of metafunction is one of a small set of principles that are necessary to explain how language works; this concept of function in language is necessary to explain the organisation of the semantic system of language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Language, context and text: Aspects of language as social semiotic. Geelong: Deakin University Press. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Function is considered to be "a fundamental property of language itself".&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Language, context and text: Aspects of language as social semiotic. Geelong: Deakin University Press. Chapter 2. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ruqaiya Hasan]], the metafunctions in SFL "are not hierarchised; they have equal status, and each is manifested in every act of language use: in fact, an important task for grammatics is to describe how the three metafunctions are woven together into the same linguistic unit".&lt;ref&gt;Hasan, R. 2009. Wanted: a theory for integrated sociolinguistics. London: Equinox. p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Hasan argues that this is one way in which Halliday's account of the functions of language is different from that of [[Karl Bühler]], for example, for whom functions of language are hierarchically ordered, with the referential function the most important of all. For Buhler, the functions were considered to operate one at a time. In SFL, the metafunctions operate simultaneously, and any utterance is a harmony of choices across all three functions.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan, R. 2009. Wanted: a theory for integrated sociolinguistics. London: Equinox. p. 9].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideational function==
The ideational function is language concerned with building and maintaining a theory of experience. It includes&lt;!--comprises? Or is there something aside from the exper. and logical?--&gt; the experiential function and the logical function.

=== Experiential function ===
The experiential function refers to the grammatical choices that enable speakers to make meanings about the world around us and inside us:

:"Most obviously, perhaps, when we watch small children interacting with the objects around them we can see that they are using language to construe a theoretical model of their experience. This is language in the experiential function; the patterns of meaning are installed in the brain and continue to expand on a vast scale as each child, in cahoots with all those around, builds up, renovates and keeps in good repair the semiotic “reality” that provides the framework of day-to-day existency and is manifested in every moment of discourse, spoken or listened to. We should stress, I think, that the grammar is not merely annotating experience; it is construing experience."&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Halliday argues that it was through this process of humans making meaning from experience that language evolved. Thus, the human species had to “make sense of the complex world in which it evolved: to classify, or group into categories, the objects and events within its awareness”. These categories are not given to us through our senses; they have to be “construed”.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1999. Grammar and the construction of educational knowledge. In The Language of Early Childhood. Volume 4 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;  In taking this position on the active role of grammar in construing “reality”, Halliday was influenced by [[Benjamin Lee Whorf|Whorf]].

===Logical function===
Halliday describes the logical function as those systems “which set up logical–semantic relationships between one clausal unit and another”&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 17"&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The systems which come under the logical function are {{Sc|taxis}} and {{Smallcaps|logico-semantic relations}}. When two clauses are combined, a speaker chooses whether to give both clauses equal status, or to make one dependent on the other. In addition, a speaker choose some meaning relation in the process of joining or binding clauses together. Halliday argues that the meanings we make in such processes are most closely related to the experiential function. For this reason, he puts the experiential and logical functions together into the ideational function.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpersonal function==
The interpersonal function refers to the grammatical choices that enable speakers to enact their complex and diverse interpersonal relations. This tenet of [[systemic functional linguistics]] is based on the claim that a speaker not only talks about something, but is always talking to and with others. Language not only construes experience, but simultaneously acts out “the interpersonal encounters that are essential to our survival”.&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 16"&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Halliday argues that these encounters:

:"range all the way from the rapidly changing microencounters of daily life – most centrally, semiotic encounters where we set up and maintain complex patterns of dialogue – to the more permanent institutionalized relationships that collectively constitute the social bond."&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 16"/&gt;

The grammatical systems that relate to the interpersonal function include &lt;!--Can these be not all-caps?--&gt;Mood, Modality, and Polarity.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. 2004. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JM3KAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Introduction to Functional Grammar]. London: Arnold.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual function==
Halliday argues that both experiential and interpersonal functions are intricately organized, but that between the two “there is comparatively very little constraint”. This means that “by and large, you can put any interactional ‘spin’ on any representational content”.&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 17"/&gt; What allows meanings from these two modes to freely combine is the intercession of a third, distinct mode of meaning that Halliday refers to as the textual function. The term encompasses all of the grammatical systems responsible for managing the flow of discourse. These systems “create coherent text – text that coheres within itself and with the context of situation” &lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 17"/&gt; They are both structural (involving choices relating to the ordering of elements in the clause), and non-structural (involving choices that create cohesive ties between units that have no structural bond). The relevant grammatical systems include Theme, Given and New,&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. Matthiessen. 2004. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JM3KAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Introduction to Functional Grammar]. Arnold&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the systems of cohesion, such as Reference, Substitution, and Ellipsis.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Hasan, R. 1976. Cohesion in English. London: Longman&lt;/ref&gt; Halliday argues that the textual function is distinct from both the experiential and interpersonal because its object is language itself. Through the textual function, language “creates a semiotic world of its own: a parallel universe, or ‘virtual reality’ in modern terms”.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M. A. K. (2003 [2001]). Is the grammar neutral? Is the grammarian neutral? In J.J. Webster (Ed.), On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York 2003, p 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Education Institute Slovenia - NEI''' ({{lang-sl|Zavod Republike Slovenije za Šolstvo}}, '''ZRSŠ''') is the main public organisation in [[Slovenia]] that encourages development in education in Slovenia up to pre-university — covering all kindergartens, elementary schools, secondary schools, music schools, and boarding schools. 

== Responsibilities and areas == 
The pedagogical consultants of the National Education Institute Slovenia research, innovate, offer recommendations, and promote changes in practice, theory, and legislation. The basic mission of the institute is to promote lifelong learning according to the goals of sustainable development, innovative environments, and innovation in general. 

NEI performs research and counseling, supports  innovation, links practice with theory and legislation, and promotes lifelong learning to schools.

== History ==
The National Education Institute Slovenia was founded on May 22, 1956 as the Educational Research Institute. On February 21, 1959, it was renamed the Institute for the Development of Education and started operating as a state administrative institution. Its primary duties were evaluation and counselling. 

On March 1, 1963, the institute was transformed from a state administrative institution into an independent institution, which henceforth operated on the principles of the then-current policy of self-management. It focused primarily on the didactics and methodology of teaching, the professional development of teachers, and the issue of pedagogical publications; its task was also to gather and study pedagogical documentation.

In 1965 the Institute for the Progress of Education and the Institute for Vocational and Technical Training were merged into the National Education Institute of the SRS. In 1969, the Slovenian Assembly passed the Law on the Pedagogical Service. On its basis the independent self-managing National Education Institute Slovenia was transformed into a state administrative body. 

On September 1, 1969, the institutes for education and pedagogic services were transformed into the nine organizational units of the National Education Institute, with regional units in [[Celje]], [[Dravograd]] (from 1979 in [[Slovenj Gradec]]), [[Koper]]/Capodistria, [[Kranj]], [[Ljubljana]], [[Maribor]], [[Murska Sobota]], [[Novo Mesto]], [[Nova Gorica]], [[Murska Sobota]]. All of the aforementioned units are still in operation. The main characteristics of the National Education Institute had been common planning, a common programme and joint work reports. 

After Slovenia gained independence in 1991, the National Education Institute Slovenia became part of the Ministry of Education and Sports. On July 6, 1995, the National Education Institute Slovenia began to operate as a public institution, which has remained unchanged since. Today, its main responsibilities are counseling, development and research, and other professional tasks in education.

[[File:Barrias Nature p1070171.jpg|thumb|A copy of ''Nature Unveiling Herself Before Science'' in [[gilding|gilt]] [[bronze]], polychromed [[marble]], and [[lapis lazuli]], from the [[Iris &amp; B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts]]]]

'''''Nature Unveiling Herself Before Science''''' ({{lang|fr|'''La Nature se dévoilant à la Science'''}}) is an [[allegorical sculpture]] created in 1899 in the [[Art Nouveau]] style by [[Louis-Ernest Barrias]]. The sculpture depicts a woman—[[personifying]] [[Mother Nature|Nature]]—removing a veil to reveal her face and bare breasts. The sculpture, which is in the [[Musée d'Orsay]], was commissioned for the [[Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers]].&lt;ref name="Objectivity"&gt;Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison, ''Objectivity''.  New York: Zone Books, 2007.  p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  Underneath the veil, Nature wears a gown held up by a [[scarab (artifact)|scarab]].  The figure is made of marble, with the gown made of [[Algeria|Algerian]] [[onyx]], and the scarab of [[malachite]].  The sculpture has also been reproduced in other media.  

According to historians of science [[Lorraine Daston]] and [[Peter Galison]], the sculpture "blends the ancient trope of the [[veil of Isis]], interpreted as nature's desire to hide her secrets, with the modern fantasy of (female) nature willingly revealing herself to the (male) scientist, without violence or artifice."&lt;ref name="Objectivity"/&gt;  According to historian of science [[Carolyn Merchant]], the sculpture is emblematic of transformation of conceptions of nature that came with the [[Scientific Revolution]]: "From an active teacher and parent, she [Nature] has become a mindless, submissive body."&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Merchant, ''The Death of Nature: Women, Ecology, and the Scientific Revolution''.  New York: HarperOne, 1990.  pp. 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a similar vein, biologist and essayist [[Gerald Weissmann]] has noted the similarity between Nature's pose in Barrias' sculpture and that of the central figure in the 1876 painting ''[[Philippe Pinel|Dr. Pinel Unchaining the Mad]]'' by [[Tony Robert-Fleury]], a released inmate from an [[insane asylum]] who has "the detached look of the very lost."&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Weissmann, "The Doctor with Two Heads" (1988) in ''Darwin's Audubon: Science and the Liberal Imagination''.  Cambridge, MA: Perseus Publishing, 1998. p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;  Literary critic [[Elaine Showalter]] imagines a companion piece depicting Science would consist of "a fully clothed man, whose gaze [is] bold, direct, and keen, the penetrating gaze of intellectual and sexual mastery".&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Showalter, ''Sexual Anarchy: Gender and Culture at the Fin de Siècle''.  Virago Press Ltd, 1992.  p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''O Land of Beauty!'''" is the [[national anthem]] of the [[Saint Kitts and Nevis|Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis]]. Written and composed by Kenrick Georges, it was officially adopted as the national anthem of the newly independent nation in 1983, when the federation received its independence from the [[United Kingdom]].

==Lyrics==
:O Land of Beauty!
:Our country where peace abounds,
:Thy children stand free
:On the strength of will and love.
:With God in all our struggles,
:Saint Kitts and Nevis be,
: A nation bound together,
:With a common destiny.

:As stalwarts we stand,
:For justice and liberty.
:With wisdom and truth,
:We will serve and honor thee.
:No sword nor spear can conquer,
:For God  will sure defend.
:His blessings shall forever,
:To posterity extend.

It was released on February 7, 2008 in Japan and on February 10, 2009 in North America by [[Tamsoft]] and [[D3 Publisher|D3]] as the first game in the OneChanbara series to be released for the Nintendo system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.d3publisher.us/PressDetails.asp?ID=163 |title=The sexy sister duo make it twice as nice for gamers in new OneChanbara videogames for the XBOX 360 and Wii |publisher=[[D3 Publisher]] |date=February 10, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719095612/http://www.d3publisher.us/PressDetails.asp?ID=163 |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features elements from [[campy]] [[exploitation films|exploitation]] horror films, with equal amounts of bloody violence and exposed female flesh all played up to an intentionally ridiculous level.

==Characters==
All playable characters are the same as the bosses and each one lasts eight stages.

* '''Aya''': Raised by her now-deceased father and trained by the sword, Aya has done her best to lead a normal life with her half-sister Saki yet been sometimes feeling a little bit insecure about her family's "Baneful Blood" curse, which has a tendency of sending her into berserk frenzies. Her alt-attack mode has her wielding two swords at once, which furthers the potency of her standard sword-fighting techniques.
* '''Saki''': Aya's younger half-sister and descended from the same cursed bloodline, Saki has fully recovered from wounds sustained during the events of ''OneChanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad'' but harbours as much worries about the "Baneful Blood" curse as her older sister does. Her alt-attack mode is focused on single-target hand-to-hand attacks with extreme lethality and precision.
* '''Reiko''': One of the nine "Single Digit" clones of Reiko Mizusaki (№1–9; all subsequent mass-production clones were based on the Single Digits instead of the original Reiko), she is capable of the full range of investigative tasks from intelligence gathering to self-defense combat and is telepathically linked to all other Single Digits and the original Reiko; in addition, she is genetically modified to duplicate what is essentially Humanity's understanding of the Baneful Blood descendants. Her story arc paints both the original Reiko and her clones in a more positive light, stating that despite extreme methods that have put her clones in conflict with Aya and Saki, Reiko's true aim is not only to wipe out the undeads but also to prevent the possibility that Baneful Blood descendants can turn on the living afterward. Reiko №9 possesses an alt-attack mode that grants her the use of [[firearm]]s and comes equipped with a [[shotgun]] and a [[submachine gun]]. She is unlocked by completing story mode using Aya.
* '''Misery''': Being revived by power left behind by Himiko (the nemesis of Aya and Saki in ''OneChanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad''), this yet another descendant of the "Baneful Blood" is now only interested in exacting vengeance upon Aya and Saki. Her alt-attack mode has her sword transformed into a whip sword, granting it a far longer reach. She is unlocked by completing story mode using Saki.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20728">'''Pagan studies''' is the multidisciplinary academic field devoted to the study of [[Modern Paganism|contemporary Paganism]], a broad assortment of [[new religious movement|modern religious movements]], which are typically influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various [[Paganism|pagan]] beliefs of premodern Europe.&lt;ref name="Carpenter 1996 40"&gt;[[#Car96|Carpenter 1996]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew04|Lewis 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Pagan studies embrace a variety of different scholarly approaches to studying such religions, drawing from history, [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[folkloristics]], [[theology]] and other [[religious studies]].

==Background==
The earliest academic studies of contemporary Paganism were published between 1970 and 1980 by scholars like [[Margot Adler]], [[Marcello Truzzi]] and [[Tanya Luhrmann]], although it would not be until the 1990s that the actual Pagan studies discipline properly developed, pioneered by academics such as Graham Harvey and [[Chas S. Clifton]]. Increasing academic interest in Paganism has been attributed to the new religious movement's increasing public visibility, as it began interacting with the [[interfaith dialogue|interfaith movement]] and holding large public celebrations at sites such as [[Stonehenge]].

The first academic conference on the subject was held at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], North-East England in 1993, followed three years later by a larger conference organised by the [[University of Lancaster]] in North-West England. Annual gatherings of the Conference on Current Pagan Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://paganconference.com/|title=Conference on Current Pagan Studies|website=Conference on Current Pagan Studies|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Contemporary Pagan Studies Unit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://papers.aarweb.org/content/contemporary-pagan-studies-unit|title=Contemporary Pagan Studies Unit {{!}} PAPERS|website=papers.aarweb.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the American Academy of Religion continue to develop scholarship in this field. In 2004, a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] devoted to the discipline, ''[[The Pomegranate (journal)|The Pomegranate]]'', began publication.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.equinoxjournals.com/ojs/index.php/pom/index|title=Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies
|publisher=www.equinoxjournals.com|accessdate=2008-05-26|last=|first=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Many books on the subject have been published by a variety of different academic publishing companies, while AltaMira Press began publication of the Pagan Studies Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csulb.edu/~wgriffin/paganstudies/|title=Pagan Studies / AltaMira Press|publisher=www.csulb.edu|accessdate=2008-05-26|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Pagan studies scholars and the contemporary Pagan community which it studies has at times been strained, with some practitioners rejecting academic interpretations of their faiths. At the same time, many academics involved in Pagan studies are practicing Pagans themselves, bringing an insider's perspective to their approaches.

Pagan studies scholar [[Chas S. Clifton]] argued that the discipline had developed as a result of the increasing "academic acknowledgement" of contemporary Paganism's "movement into the public eye", referring to the emergence of Pagan involvement with [[interfaith]] groups and the Pagan use of archaeological monuments as "sacred sites", particularly in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 7"/&gt; Clifton also argued that the development of Pagan studies was necessary to "set forth an audacious redefinition of the term "pagan" as [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] has done", something which Clifton felt "gives us room to reexamine from fresh perspectives all manifestation of ancient Pagan religions".&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 7&amp;ndash;8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. pp. 7&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
The first international academic conference on the subject of Pagan studies was held at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], North-East England in 1993. It had been organised by two British religious studies scholars, [[Graham Harvey (author)|Graham Harvey]] and Charlotte Hardman.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996 a larger conference dealing with contemporary Paganism took place at [[Ambleside]] in the [[Lake District]], organised by the Department of Religious Studies at the [[University of Lancaster]], North-West England. Titled "Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s", it led to the publication of an academic anthology, ''[[Nature Religion Today|Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World]]''.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson 1998 1"&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In that anthology, some of the conference's organisers described its original intentions, remarking that through it they "sought to explore the innovations in practice and belief which constitute contemporary Paganism, and which appear to be a part of a widespread cultural response to the decay of main-line religions and to a widely felt awareness of ecological crisis."&lt;ref name="Pearson 1998 1"/&gt;

That same year saw the beginnings of ''The Pomegranate'', which would later be transformed into a peer-reviewed academic journal, which first appeared in 2004.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 5"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the books AltaMira released was ''Researching Paganisms'', an anthology edited by Jenny Blain, Douglas Ezzy and [[Graham Harvey (author)|Graham Harvey]] in which different Pagan studies scholars discussed their involvement with the subject and the opposition that they have faced.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bla04|Blain, Ezzy and Harvey 2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethan Doyle White noted that as Pagan studies reached its twentieth year, it came under "increasing pressure to explain itself, both to academia and to the Pagan community that it studies."{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|p=17}}

==Approaches==
===Sociological===
[[File:Margot-adler-2004.jpg|thumb|right|Margot Adler ''(pictured in 2004)'' published an early sociological study of Paganism in the United States.]]
In 1979, the American sociologist, journalist and Wiccan [[Margot Adler]] published ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon]]'', a sociological study of the Pagan movement across the United States, covering Wiccans, Druids, Goddess Worshipers, Heathens and Radical Faeries.

In 1999, the American sociologist [[Helen A. Berger]] of [[West Chester University]] published ''[[A Community of Witches]]'', a sociological study of the Wiccan and Pagan movement in the north-eastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious studies===
In 2003, the British religious studies scholar [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] published ''[[Pagan Theology|Pagan Theology: Paganism as a World Religion]]'', in which he argued that contemporary Paganism could be seen as a part of a much wider global "paganism" which encompassed a large variety of animistic and polytheistic religious traditions, including [[Indigenous religion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ABC-CLIO published an anthology entitled ''[[Modern Paganism in World Cultures]]'', which was edited by the American religious studies scholar Michael F. Strmiska.

===Historical===
Among the first scholars to study contemporary Paganism from a historical perspective was the American Wiccan [[Aidan Kelly]], who had been a founding member of the [[New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn]] and the [[Covenant of the Goddess]] during the 1970s. Having attained several academic qualifications, including in the field of religious studies, in the 1970s he began a study of the religious texts of [[Gardnerian Wicca]], in order to establish a historical chronology for the tradition. The results of his study would only be published in 1991, as ''Crafting the Art of Magic''. This would later be rewritten and republished in 2007 as ''Inventing Witchcraft''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kel07|Kelly 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The prominent English historian [[Ronald Hutton]] of the [[University of Bristol]] later devoted the latter part of his book ''[[The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles]]'' (1991) to an examination of the contemporary Pagan religions that took these pre-Christian religions as a core influence. He followed this with several studies of British folk customs, but in 1999 returned to the field of Pagan studies when he published ''[[The Triumph of the Moon|The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft]]'', the first academic study of [[History of Wicca|Wiccan history]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical debates==
Pagan studies has been charged with failing to properly define "paganism", as some scholars use it solely to designate contemporary Paganism and others &amp;ndash; like Michael York and Chas Clifton &amp;ndash; using it to refer to a wide range of religious movements across the world and throughout history.{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|pp=11&amp;ndash;15}} A further problem arises from the fact that while Pagan studies scholars might adopt "paganism" in reference to pre-Christian belief systems in Europe, the term was increasingly rejected by archaeologists specialising in those belief systems.{{sfn|Doyle White|2014|p=11}}

Pagan studies has failed to satisfactorily define "contemporary Paganism"; a minority of scholars have treated it as a singular religion within which groups like Wicca and Heathenry are [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s, while a larger group have instead treated it as a "group of comparative religions".{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|pp=15&amp;ndash;17}} The concern has been made that Pagan studies scholars would be "at a loss to convey (to ourselves and to others), what it is that we are actually studying. The current situation, in which widely differing definitions are being used in tandem, is clearly unsustainable."{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|p=18}}

Religious studies scholar Markus Altena Davidsen published a critique of the field in 2012, via a review of the ''Handbook of Contemporary Paganism''.{{sfn|Davidsen|2012}} Ethan Doyle White in ''The Pomegranate'', arguing that there were flaws in Davidsen's approach.{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|p=5}} Arguing that the ''Handbook of Contemporary Paganism'' was not as symptomatic of the field as Davidsen had assumed, he goes on to identify a number of factual errors within Davidsen's paper.{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|pp=7&amp;ndash;8}} Doyle White argued that Davidsen's division of scholars into firmly insider and outsider categories was problematic as scholars of Pagan studies like [[Sabina Magliocco]] straddled both boundaries, an approach based in the methodologies employed in anthropology.{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|pp=8&amp;ndash;11}}

==Relationship with Pagan community==
The relationship between Pagan studies scholars and some practicing Pagans has at times been strained.{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|p=17}} The Australian academic and practicing Pagan Caroline Jane Tully argued that as a result of [[cognitive dissonance]], many Pagans can react negatively to new scholarship regarding historical pre-Christian societies, believing that it is a threat to the structure of their beliefs and "sense of identity." She furthermore argued that some of those dissatisfied Pagans lashed out against academics as a result, particularly on the internet.{{sfn|Tully|2011|pp=98&amp;ndash;99}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2877">The '''Pahargarh caves''' are a [[cave complex]] containing [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] [[Cave painting|paintings]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]], near the village of [[Pahargarh]]. The most prominent of the caves is known locally as '''Likhichhaj'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://morena.nic.in/VisitingSabalgarh.html|title=Cave paintings in the cave shelters|last=|first=|date=|website=The Worth Visiting Places of Distt|publisher=Morena District|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings were discovered in 1979 by D. P. S. Dwarikesh, a professor of [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Michigan]], and Shri Ram Sharma, a civil engineer from Pahargarh. Dwarikesh and Sharma conducted preliminary surveys of the caves, documenting over 600 paintings, and speculated that there were thousands more. However, they were not able to obtain permission to excavate and the caves have not been investigated since.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/western_news/1039/|title=India cave project gets preliminary grant OK|last=|first=|date=4 December 1980|work=Western News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|issue=14|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/pahargarh-caves-clues-to-india-prehistory/1/402256.html|title=Pahargarh caves: A wealth of archaeological treasure|last=Bobb|first=Dilip|date=15 October 1981|work=India Today|access-date=2017-07-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Made with red and white [[ochre]]-based paints, the depictions include human and animal figures as well as abstract shapes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The dating of the paintings is uncertain. According to Dwarikesh, [[ostrich]] [[Eggshell|egg shells]] discovered in the caves were [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to 25,000 years ago,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; but they also discovered [[Iron Age in India|Iron Age]] artefacts dating to ca. 1500 BCE and the paintings themselves depict tools consistent with a date of 600 BCE.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMOgcqNS4bs&amp;t=3s&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''paper generator''' is computer software that composes [[scholarly paper]]s in the style of those that appear in [[academic journal]]s or [[conference proceedings]]. Typically, the generator uses technical [[jargon]] from the field to compose sentences that are grammatically correct and seem erudite but are actually nonsensical. The prose is supported by tables, figures, and references that may be valid in themselves, but are randomly inserted rather than relevant.&lt;ref name=TW&gt;{{citation |pages=56–59 |chapter=3.7.5 Paper Generators |title=Technical Writing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists |author=Phillip A.

'''Paubhā''' ([[Devanagari]]: पौभा) is a traditional religious painting made by the [[Newar]] people of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chitrakar |first=Madan |title=Nepali Art |publisher=Teba-Chi Studies Centre |location=Kathmandu |year=2012 |pages=35–52 |chapter=Paubha Art|isbn=978-9937-2-4933-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paubhas depict deities, [[mandala]]s or monuments, and are used to help the practitioner meditate. The [[Tibetan art|Tibetan]] equivalent is known as [[Thangka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Shakya| first =Min Bahadur| url = http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/16/paubha-paintings.html| title =Paubha Paintings| work = | publisher = Arts of Nepal| date=2011| accessdate = 24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, A.W. and Stahl, Anne Vergati (1979) ''Newar Art: Nepalese Art during the Malla Period.'' New Delhi: Vikas Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most paubhas show [[Buddhist]] subjects, but a few have [[Hindu]] themes. The paintings are made to earn religious merit both for the artist and the patron. Newar Buddhists commission artists to paint paubhas which are displayed during festivals and other special occasions. The traditional painters of paubhas are the [[Chitrakar]] caste who are known as Pun (पुं) in [[Nepal Bhasa]].&lt;ref&gt;Chitrakar, Madan (2000) ''Tej Bahadur Chitrakar: Icon of a Transition.''

==History==

A paubha of [[Amitabha Buddha]] at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|Los Angeles County Museum]] is believed to be the earliest specimen which is done in a style dating from the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Shakya| first =Min Bahadur| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/16/paubha-paintings.html| title =Paubha Paintings| work = | publisher = Arts of Nepal| date=2011| accessdate = 24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

 ([[Nepal Sambat]] 485). It is a specimen of the skill of Newar artists that made them sought-after throughout the Himalayan region and as far as China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/2011/c-welch-part-ii-l11228/overview.html| title = The Stuart Cary Welch Collection | work = | publisher = Sotheby's| year=| accessdate =24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newar artists and merchants took the paubha art to Tibet from which the Tibetan thangka evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| url =http://rmanyc.org/exhibitions/view/682| title =The Nepalese Legacy in Tibetan Painting| work =| publisher =Rubin Museum of Art| year =| accessdate =25 September 2012| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20111120102024/http://www.rmanyc.org/exhibitions/view/682| archivedate =20 November 2011| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The painting==

Paubhas are painted on a rectangular piece of canvas. It is prepared by applying a mixture of buffalo glue and white clay on it. The surface is then rubbed with a smooth stone to give it polish. The painting is done according to the rules and dimensions handed down by tradition, and artists cannot exercise their creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pradhan|first=Ujjwal |title=A heritage in peril
|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2010/07/09/features/a-heritage-in-peril/210299/ |date=10 July 2010 | accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The paint is made from minerals and plants. Gold and silver paint are also used on paubhas. The eyes of the deity are painted when the rest of the painting has been completed, and is known as "mikhā chāyekegu" (opening the eyes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Gurung (Pradhan)| first =Renuka| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/13/paubha-painting-the-traditional-art-of-nepal.html| title =Paubha Painting: The Traditional Art of Nepal| work = | publisher = Arts of Nepal| date=2011| accessdate = 24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brocade is sewn to the edge of the paubha to make a frame for display.

From a composition perspective, the surface of Paubha is usually occupied of a large figure in the center that is placed inside a shrine and surrounded by registers of smaller figures on the sides; the background is usually filled in with natural elements such as rocks rendered in abstract patterns. The color is often deep and subdued with subtle shadings of the figures and exquisite renderings of details that are the hallmarks of early Nepalese paubhas&lt;ref&gt;Huu Phuoc Le, Le Huu Phuoc, '''Buddhist Architecture '''', Grafikol, 2010 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==

An annual exhibition of statues of [[Dipankara Buddha]] and paubhas is held in sacred courtyards in the [[Kathmandu Valley]]. The ceremony is known as Bahidyah Bwayegu (बहीद्यः ब्वयेगु), and is held during the month of [[Gunla]]. Gunla, which corresponds to August, is a holy month for Newar Buddhists. Groups of devotees led by musical bands make a tour of the courtyards to view the displays. In recent times, the traditional exhibitions have become fewer and shorter due to fear of art thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Shakya| first =Min Bahadur| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/16/paubha-paintings.html| title =Paubha Paintings| work = | publisher = Arts of Nepal| date=2011| accessdate = 26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}
{{Postmodernism}}
[[Postmodernism|Postmodern theory]] (PM) in [[anthropology]] originated in the 1960s along with the literary [[postmodern movement]] in general. Anthropologists working in this vein of inquiry seek to dissect, interpret and write cultural critiques.

One issue discussed by PM anthropologists is about subjectivity; because [[ethnography|ethnographies]] are influenced by the disposition of the author, should their opinions be considered scientific?  [[Clifford Geertz]], considered a founding member of postmodernist anthropology,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} advocates that, “anthropological writings are themselves interpretations, and second and third ones to boot”&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, C. (1973). The Interpretations of Cultures. New York: Basic Books, Inc. (pp.15)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, some anthropologists use a form of [[standpoint theory]]; a person's perspective in writing and cultural interpretation of others is guided by their own background and experiences.

Other major tenets of postmodernist anthropology are: 
* an emphasis on including the opinions and perspectives of the people being studied,
* [[cultural relativism]] as a method of inquiry&lt;ref name=Garder1996&gt;{{cite book|last=Katy Garder and David Lewis|title=Anthropology, Development and the Post-Modernist Challenge|year=1996|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London, UK|isbn=0745307469|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* skepticism towards the claims of science to producing objective and universally valid knowledge&lt;ref name=Spiro1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spiro|first=Melford E.|title=Postmodernist Anthropology, Subjectivity, and Science: A Modernist Critique|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=October 1996|volume=38|issue=4|pages=759–780|url=http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/current/readings/spiro-anti-pomo.pdf|accessdate=29 March 2013|doi=10.1017/s0010417500020521}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the rejection of grand, universal schemes or theories which explain other cultures (Barrett 1996).

A critique by non-anthropologists has been to question whether anthropologists may speak/write on behalf of cultural others.  [[Margery Wolf]] states that, “it would be as great a loss to have first-world anthropologists confine their research to the first world as it is (currently) to have third-world anthropologists confine theirs to the third world”.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, M. (1992). A Thrice Told Tale: [[Feminism]], Postmodernism &amp; Ethnographic Responsibility. Stanford: Stanford University Press. (pp. 1-14)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, the question has been resolved by pointing out that all cultural descriptions are of cultural others. All ethnographic writing is done by a person from one standpoint writing about others living in a different standpoint. Thus, the notion of anthropologists as 'culture brokers' (see Richard Kurin) has been adopted to explain why anthropologists from any given country write about cultural others.

== Indian New Deal ==
Indian reformer [[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]] in 1920-22 studied the [[Taos Pueblo]] In New Mexico, with an architecture and culture stretching back centuries. It made a lasting impression on Collier.  He now saw the Indian world as morally superior to American society, which he considered to be "physically, religiously, socially, and aesthetically shattered, dismembered, directionless."&lt;ref&gt;John Collier, "Does the Government Welcome the Indian Arts?" ''The American Magazine of Art. Anniversary Supplement'' vol. 27, no. 9, Part 2 (1934): 10-13&lt;/ref&gt;  Collier came under attack for his romantic views about the moral superiority of traditional society as opposed to modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Kunitz, "The social philosophy of John Collier." ''Ethnohistory'' (1971): 213-229. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/481531 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Collier became the main architect of the [[Indian Reorganization Act|Indian New Deal]] 1933-45. He employed the perspectives we now call postmodern to reverse the long-standing national policy of [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|compulsory assimilation of Native Americans]].  He enlisted numerous anthropologists in the 1930s and 1940s to support his position. Philp says after his experience at the Taos Pueblo, Collier "made a lifelong commitment to preserve tribal community life because it offered a cultural alternative to modernity....His romantic stereotyping of Indians often did not fit the reality of contemporary tribal life."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth R. Philp. "Collier, John" [http://www.anb.org/articles/15/15-00139.html;  ''American National Biography Online'' Feb. 2000. Access Date: May 05 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17286">'''Public diplomacy in the Islamic Republic of Iran''' refers to the [[public relations]] efforts to disseminate information about the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]. Such efforts seek to communicate with foreign publics in order to establish a dialogue designed to inform and influence. Instruments of public diplomacy in the Islamic Republic of Iran include cultural exchanges, film and print media, and sports diplomacy.

== Definition ==

There is no standard definition of [[public diplomacy]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Public Diplomacy is that "form of international Political Advocacy in which the civilians of one country use legitimate means to reach out to the civilians of another country in order to gain popular support for negotiations occurring through diplomatic channels."&lt;ref name=polticalwar&gt;Smith Jr., Paul A. ''On Political War'' (Washington: National Defense University Press, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The United States Information Agency, the predecessor to the U.S. State Department's [[Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs]], defines as public diplomacy as efforts that seek "to promote the national interest of … through understanding, informing and influencing foreign audiences."&lt;ref name=definePD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicdiplomacy.org/pages/index.php?page=about-public-diplomacy |title=what it is and is not |publisher=Public diplomacy |date=1997-06-20 |accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The U.S. State Department's "Dictionary of International Relations Terms" defines public diplomacy as anything that "refers to government-sponsored programs intended to inform or influence public opinion in other countries; its chief instruments are publications, motion pictures, cultural exchanges, radio and television."&lt;ref name=definePD/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Michael McClellan, one time Public Diplomacy Counselor for the U.S. Embassy Dublin, notes that "public diplomacy [is] the strategic planning and execution of informational, cultural and educational programming by an advocate country to create a public opinion environment in a target country or countries that will enable target country political leaders to make decisions that are supportive of advocate country's foreign policy objectives."&lt;ref name=definePDubD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicdiplomacy.org/45.htm |title=Public Diplomacy in the Context of Traditional Diplomacy |publisher=Publicdiplomacy.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The distinguishing factor between [[diplomacy]] and public diplomacy is the target audience. Where traditional diplomacy focuses on governments communicating with one another, public diplomacy seeks to engage foreign citizens and publics in order to change opinions and perceptions. Public diplomacy may present a point of view that differs than that of the targeted population's home government.&lt;ref name=definePD/&gt; In such cases, critics argue that public diplomacy is a new word for [[influence operations]] and/or [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name=PDandProp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2008/0709/comm/brown_pudiplprop.html |title=Brown &amp;#124; Public Diplomacy and Propaganda: Their Differences |publisher=Unc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural diplomacy ==
The U.S. Department of State defines [[cultural diplomacy]] as the "linchpin of public diplomacy; for it is in cultural activities that a nation's idea of itself is best represented."&lt;ref name=defineCulDip&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/54374.pdf|title=Cultural Diplomacy the Linchpin of Public Diplomacy |publisher=U.S. Department of State Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, cultural diplomacy seeks to demonstrate national values which might be shared with foreign audiences.

The Islamic Republic of Iran relies on its cultural heritage and exchanges as a basis for its public diplomacy campaign. Researchers state that culture forms a considerable part of Iran's soft power and Tehran actively utilizes public diplomacy instruments for its enhancement.&lt;ref&gt;Bahriev B.Kh., Jabbari Nasir H. Public diplomacy in the foreign policy of Islamic Republic of Iran. ''Public diplomacy: theory and practice'', ed.by M.M.Lebedeva. — Moscow, Aspekt Press, 2017. pp.194-216.(in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Islamic Culture and Relations Organization ===

The Islamic Culture and Relations Organization, subordinate to the [[Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance]], is the Islamic Republic of Iran's primary organization for implementing and leading cultural outreach outside of Iran.&lt;ref name=icro&gt;[http://en.icro.ir Islamic Culture and Relations Organization]&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the ICRO is to promote "cultural ties with other nations and communities; consolidation of cultural ties of the Islamic republic of Iran with other nations; [offer] proper presentation of the Iranian culture and civilization; preparing the grounds for unity among Muslims; revival and promotion of Islamic culture and teachings in the world; and information dissemination about the principles and realities of the Islamic Revolution."&lt;ref name=icro/&gt; The Islamic Culture and Relations Organization is Iran's de facto public diplomacy organization.

Selected Islamic Culture and Relations Organization activities include:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The '''Iran Friendship Association''' seeks to target prominent members of the Albanian business, political, and scientific communities. Created by Alibeman Eghbali Zarch, former Iranian Ambassador to Albania, the Iran Friendship Association has strong ties to the Albania Institute of Islamic Thought and Culture.&lt;ref name=balkans&gt;{{cite web |first= Michaletos |last=Ioannis | year=2010 | url=http://www.analyst-network.com/article.php?art_id=3610 | title=http://www.analyst-network.com/article.php?art_id=3610| accessdate=2011-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The '''Saadi Shirazi Cultural Foundation''' is directly financed through the Islamic Culture and Relations Organizations. The foundation provides support for Iranian-related activities and organizations in Albania. Such support has included providing Iranian personalities for speaking tours in Tirana, including former Members of Iranian Parliament. The Saadi Shirazi Cultural Foundation targets middle and upper class Albanians.&lt;ref name=balkans/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Islamic Culture and Relations Organization hosts '''art exhibitions''' displaying Iranian and Persian culture and history. In 2011, the Iranian Embassy in Jakarta provided an exhibition showcasing Persian calligrapher Mojtaba Sabzeh. The exhibition displayed Persian calligraphy samples while also offering discussion, seminars, and workshops related to Iranian art.  The Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting's Press TV provided the reporting of the 2011 Jakarta event.&lt;ref name=JakartaArt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.icro.ir/index.aspx?siteid=257&amp;pageid=11747&amp;newsview=572805 |title=Jakarta hosts Persian calligraphy show |publisher=Press TV via ICRO | date=2011-11-23 |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Islamic Culture and Relations Organization and Iranian Embassy in Algiers hosted the '''Capital of Islamic Culture 2011''' program in Tlemcen, Algeria. The event mixed Algerian and Iranian cartoons, handicrafts, paintings, and sculpture. The program further linked Algeria and Iran's shared Islamic history.&lt;ref name=AlgeriaArt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/index.php/arts-and-culture/3317-iranian-cultural-festival-underway-in-algeria |title=Iranian cultural festival underway in Algeria |publisher=Tehran Times | date=2011-08-08 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Music diplomacy ===
[[Music diplomacy]] is one aspect of cultural diplomacy that seeks to engage foreign publics through musical performances. The [[Tehran Symphony Orchestra]] is often sponsored by the Iranian government in musical exchanges throughout the world. In its efforts to approach European audiences, Iran's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] provided free tickets to invited dignitaries and guests. Describing the 2010 European tour, the New York Times referenced overt propaganda through performances of the "Peace and Friendship Symphony", a piece written to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the [[Islamic Revolution]]. Much of the tour was met with criticism by demonstrations and protests. Michael Kimmelman of the New York Times declared the performance a tragedy, failing to meet the efforts of proper cultural exchange and public diplomacy.&lt;ref name=musicNYT&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/arts/music/04abroad.html  |title=The Sour Notes of Iran's Art Diplomacy |publisher=New York Times | date=2010-02-03 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports diplomacy ===
Sports diplomacy refers to the use of sport and sport activity as a means to influence diplomatic, social, and political relations of a foreign public. Sporting exchanges provide a platform for increased dialogue among the people of foreign states, and to promote cultural understanding.&lt;ref name=sportdiplo&gt;{{cite web |url= http://exchanges.state.gov/sports/diplomacy.html  |title=What is Sports Diplomacy? |publisher=U.S. Department of State Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Having placed in the 49th World Team Table Tennis Championship in the People's Republic of China, Iran's '''Table Tennis''' team accepted an offer to hold joint training with the United States. The Iranian team trained in Las Vegas, beating the U.S. team 3-1. The Iranian team went on to play in the Las Vegas Open Table Tennis Tournament that year.&lt;ref name=tabletennis&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.payvand.com/news/08/jun/1181.html|title=Sports Diplomacy: Iran's Table Tennis Team heading for U.S. |publisher=Vayvand news |date= 2008-06-20|accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Wrestling''' is the national sport of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the Iranian athletics associations often invites foreign teams to compete in the Takhti Cup. Iran admitted the United States to the 1998 Takhti Cup in a cultural exchange. The 1998 Takhti Cup welcomed the first American sports team to Iran since the Islamic Revolution. Iran views the opportunity to show its rich heritage and history in the sport of wrestling.&lt;ref name=wrestling&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2007/January/20070116162542attocnich0.2889063.html|title=U.S. Wrestlers Excited by Challenge of Takhti Cup in Iran |publisher=America.gov Archive |date=2007-01-16  |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting ==

The [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]] is the state-run broadcast communications organization. The IRIB contributes to the Islamic Republic's cultural diplomacy by providing Iranian focused radio, satellite-television, and web based broadcasts presented in a number of languages.

=== Al Alam ===
[[Al Alam]] is the IRIB's 24-hour Arabic satellite channel, targeting over 300 million Arabic speakers worldwide. Launched in early 2003, the network initially served as a platform of opposition to both the Iraq led Ba'ath Party and the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. The BBC early reported that Al Alam shared programming similarities to Qatar-based Al Jazeera, only with an Iranian message.&lt;ref&gt; name=alalam&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2913593.stm |title=Iran TV channel targets Iraq |publisher=BBC News|date=2003-04-03|accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such reporting has allowed Al Alam to promote a pan-Muslim image in order to downplay the Shia-Sunni sectarian conflict during the height of Operation Iraqi Freedom.&lt;ref&gt; name=alalam&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cjr.org/feature/alalams_game.php?page=all |title=Al Alam's Game |publisher=Columbia Journalism Review|accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hispan TV ===

[[HispanTV]] is the IRIB's newest satellite network venture, targeting Spanish speaking populations of the Americas. First offering its news and analysis via the internet, HispanTV is scheduled to expand its satellite broadcasts in early 2012.&lt;ref name=prisma&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theprisma.co.uk/2011/07/03/spanish-language-tv-channel-in-iran/ |title=Spanish language TV channel in Iran |publisher=ThePrisma.co.uk |date=2011-07-03 |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hispan TV is intending to counter what Ali Mohaqqeq, General-Secretary of the Iranian Embassy in Brazil, says is a western "monopoly of news about Iran and the Middle East in [[Latin America]]."&lt;ref name=rnw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.rnw.nl/medianetwork/iran-launches-spanish-language-hispan-tv |title=Iran launches Spanish-language Hispan TV |publisher=Radio Netherlands Worldwide |date=2011-08-23 |accessdate=2011-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211031201/http://blogs.rnw.nl/medianetwork/iran-launches-spanish-language-hispan-tv |archivedate=2012-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Goals ====

The primary goal of Hispan TV is to provide a complete platform of multimedia service to the Spanish speaking peoples of Latin America, offering an opportunity for cultural exchange through television and web broadcasts.&lt;ref name=aboutHispan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hispantv.com/About.aspx|title=QUÉ ES HISPANTV |publisher=www.hispantv.com  |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further goals include:
* To produce audio-visual and film materials that offer the cultural reality of Iran, the Middle East, and the Spanish speaking Americas to viewers
* To reflect the reality of Spanish speaking countries within its social construct, presented in its original context
* To interpret day-to-day social realities via television and web
* To develop, provide, and support audio-visual equipment for broadcast, granting effective feedback 
* To broadcast informative programs that include art, culture, economics, education, entertainment, food, health, politics, science, society issues, sports, technology, and other areas
* To permanently transform Hispan TV as a bridge of friendship and understanding between the peoples of Iran, the Middle East, and Latin America, which will allow the development of shared principles of friendship, fraternity, brotherhood, solidarity, and justice,&lt;ref name=aboutHispan/&gt;

=== iFilm ===

Like Al Alam, [[iFilm]] is an Arabic speaking satellite network that targets much of Southwest Asia. The iFilm network presents Iranian films and serials to the Arab world in an attempt to present a near-real likeness of Iranian culture and society. Programs include: art and culture, documentaries, movies, short films and television series. Such television shows seek to build mutual friendship and understanding between Iranian and foreign (Arabic-speaking) publics. Broadcasts are aired in three 8-hour blocks, allowing all Middle Eastern communities the opportunity to view their favorite films and serials. As a network financed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, iFilm depicts television entertainment in accordance to the mandates of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=الأحد 2012/03/11 |url=http://www.ifilmtv.ir/ |title=iFilm |publisher=Ifilmtv.ir |date= |accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Al Kawthar TV ===

[[ALKAWTHAR|Al Kawthar TV]] is IRIB's Arabic-speaking religious network. Promoting Shi'a Islam, Al Kawthar provides religious programming targeting the Middle East and North Africa. Programming includes Islamic cultural, intellectual, and social documentaries. The network seeks to promote unity among Muslims, strengthening Iran's position within the Islamic community. Al Kawthar TV provides roughly nineteen hours of broadcasts per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alkawthartv.ir/ Al Kawthar TV]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Press TV ===

[[Press TV]] is a 24-hour English language satellite network targeting Europe and North America. Headquartered in Tehran, Press TV provides documentaries, news analysis, and sports briefs. The mission of Press TV is definitive of public diplomacy in its goal "to heed the voices and perspectives of the people of the world; build bridges of cultural understanding; encourage human beings of different nationalities, races and creeds to identity with one another; bring to light untold and overlooked stories of individuals who have experienced political and cultural divides firsthand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presstv.ir/About.html |title=Press TV |publisher=Presstv.ir |date=2010-09-27 |accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Press TV has been accused of being a mouthpiece of [[Propaganda in The Islamic Republic of Iran|propaganda]] for the Iranian regime.&lt;ref name=presstv&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToCUt4lljpM&amp;feature=player_embedded |title= BBC Newsnight  |date=2009-07-01|accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Renaissance Enterprises''' is a [[nonprofit]] organization devoted to bringing the arts to residents of long term care facilities and senior centers.  They are one of the few agencies to address the need for regular arts and therapeutic music interaction between professional artists, artisans and performers and the isolated elderly.

==Origins==
[[Image:Renaissance Enterprises audience.jpg|400px|right|Audience for a Renaissance program]]
Renaissance Enterprises was founded in 1988 by [[Bob Rowe]] to reach out to elderly members of the community. The organization operates in [[Michigan]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Tennessee]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] as well as some neighboring states.

==Mission==
The mission of Renaissance Enterprises is to provide therapeutic entertainment at nursing homes and related facilities through the use of artists, artisans and performers.&lt;ref&gt;http://visioncouncil.org/bobrowe/&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim is to deliver messages of love, healing and hope by means of the live arts to residents of long term care facilities.  They note that abundant medical literature exists supporting the benefits of music to elderly and people with significant impairments such as physical pain or [[mental disorder]]. [[Music therapy]] is an accepted medical approach.

Renaissance produced a booklet for artists to guide them in performances for these special audiences.  Therein they also note that often they experience small wonders where an audience member had been silent for months or years but the music awakened something in them and prompted them to speech.&lt;ref&gt; "ARTS: Artists and Residents Together" http://visioncouncil.org/bobrowe/Files/New%20artist%20guideline%20booklet.pdf, last accessed April 29 2016 &lt;/ref&gt; 

Renaissance uses a staff of 25 volunteer artists for this purpose and typically delivers over 100 performances per year to audiences that are confined.

==Notability==

[[File:Bob_and_GV_Boys_at_Mercy.jpg|500px|right|Bob and the Green Valley Boys pose with some residents after a concert in Battle Creek Michigan]]

In 2006 the executive director was presented with the [[Mother Teresa Award#Mother Teresa Award|Mother Teresa Award]] for this work.

In 1994, Mother Teresa wrote: "Your work of love in nursing homes, hospitals and for the aged, the neglected and the forgotten is truly the work of peace, for the fruit of love is service and the fruit of service is peace. Works of love like yours bring one face to face with God.

'''Responsive evaluation''' is an approach to measure the effectiveness of educational programs developed by Robert E. Stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-010-0309-4_5|title=International Handbook of Educational Evaluation|last=Stake|first=Robert|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9781402008498|editor-last=Kellaghan|editor-first=Thomas|series=Kluwer International Handbooks of Education|pages=63–68|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-010-0309-4_5#page-1|editor-last2=Stufflebeam|editor-first2=Daniel L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach enables to evaluate the educational and other programs by comparing the program activity, the program uniqueness, and the social diversity of the people.

The most important feature in the Responsive evaluation is the [[responsiveness]] to main issues and problems, in particular those cases where people recognize at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://education.illinois.edu/circe/EDPSY490E/B_2_Responsive_Evaluation.html|title=RESPONSIVE EVALUATION B2.

The [https://education.illinois.edu/circe/EDPSY490E/B_2_Responsive_Evaluation.html Responsive evaluation] emphasizes:
# Educational problems more than objectives or hypotheses
# Direct and indirect observation of program participation (the pluralism of value standards held by various groups) 
# A continuous attention to audience information-needs and media for reporting

In order to achieve a well responsive evaluation, it is essential to preordinate the evaluation.

This approach designs a "front-loaded" with the evaluation tools consumed to accomplish the observations by interpreting them. The Preordinate Evaluation has a relative contrast with the Responsive Evaluation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0191-491X(76)90004-3|title=A theoretical statement of responsive evaluation - Studies in Educational Evaluation.

The Preordinate Evaluation design highlights:
# A formal statement of goals
# Standardized tests of student performance
# Value standards held by program staff 
# A “[[Research journal|research-journal]]” type of report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1163798|title=Evaluating with Validity. Vol. 4, No. 1. pp. 119-125|last=House|first=Ernest|date=Spring 1982|website=American Educational Research Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsive Design ==
The fundamental project of the Responsive predispositition is Stake’s 12 Prominent Events:

a) Identify program scope

b) Overview program activities

c) Discover purposes and concerns

d) Conceptualize issues and problems

e) Identify data needs

f) Select observers, judges, and instruments (if any)

g) Observe designated antecedents, transactions, and outcomes

h) Thematize and prepare portrayals and case studies

i) [[Winnowing|Winnow]], match issues to audiences

j) Format for audience use;

k) Assemble formal reports (if any)

l) Talk with clients, program staff, and audiences (Stake, 1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=And Others Case Studies in Science Education, Volume I: The Case Reports.|last=Stake|first=Robert|publisher=Center for Instructional - Research and Curriculum Evaluation|year=January 1978|isbn=|location=Illinois University|pages=19–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strengths of Responsive Evaluation ==
[[File:Impact evaluation (13652646293).jpg|thumb|The use of policy objectives and performance indicators in policy-making and policy-oriented debates has two important benefi ts: it gives focus and it provides a language for policy, management and even political debates&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.evaluatieplatform.be/doc/Van%20der%20Knaap%20-%202006%20-%20responsive%20eval.pdf|title=Responsive Evaluation and Performance Management.

Vol. 11, No.,|last=Stake|first=Robert|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=January 1977|isbn=|location=Illinois University|pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formative evaluation is useful when the project staff needs help monitoring the program and when no one knows what problems are going to face it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://slr.scholasticahq.com/api/v1/attachments/639/download|title=Using Responsive Evaluation in Strategic Management, Volume 4, Issue 2|last=Cameron|first=Bobby T.|date=2014|website=Strategic Leadership view|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2010-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Responsive Evaluation is preferred over the Pre-ordinate evaluation when someone wants to know the extent to which set objectives have changed (Stake, 1972). The responsive approach let to generate large bases of data,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A responsive evaluation of two programs in medical education.

== Gender-Responsive Evaluation ==
[[Gender]]-Responsive evaluation is important as a means for building strong systems for generating and using evidence in order to improve the work that people do to achieve gender equality and [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jin-in/what-is-womens-empowerment_b_9399668.html women’s empowerment]. Gender-responsive evaluation is a powerful resource for accomplish the transformative agenda of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwomen.org/es/digital-library/publications/2015/4/un-women-evaluation-handbook-how-to-manage-gender-responsive-evaluation|title=UN Women Evaluation Handbook: How to manage gender-responsive evaluation. viii + 168|last=Entidad de las Naciones Unidas para la Igualdad de Género y el Empoderamiento de las Mujeres|first=|date=|work=ONU Mujeres|access-date=2017-05-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender-responsive approach can improve gender equality and the empowerment of women by incorporating gender and women’s rights aspects into evaluation approaches, methods, processes and use. Therefore, the evaluation is a link of positive change towards gender equality and the empowerment of women, but moreover the process itself also empowers the involved stakeholders and in this way, it prevents further gender discrimination and exclusion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gest.unu.edu/static/files/unwomen-evaluationhandbook-web-final.pdf|title=HOW TO MANAGE GENDER-RESPONSIVE EVALUATION|last=UN Women. The Independent Evaluation Office Design: dammsavage studio|first=|date=2015|website=UN Women|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective gender-responsive programs and interventions enhance to eliminate social factors such as racism, sexism, and economic oppression which cannot be overlooked in discussions of effective interventions for women offenders. In termes of dealing with individual issues is important to take in consideration the social issues of poverty, race and gender inequalities because they have a profound impact on women lives. Successful interventions must relate to the social realities where women come from and to which they will return. Gender-Responsive Evaluation is sensitive to cultural differences and expectations. The very first challenge is to use theories and research development that support the implementation of these critical programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/research/forum/e113/113f_e.pdf|title=Gender-responsive programming for women offenders: Guiding principles and practices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12058">'''Secular coming-of-age ceremonies''', sometimes called '''civil confirmations''', are ceremonies arranged by organizations that are [[secular]], i.e., not aligned to any [[religion]]. Their purpose is to prepare [[adolescent]]s for their life as [[adult]]s. Secular [[coming-of-age|coming of age]] ceremonies originated in the 19th century, when non-religious people wanted a [[rite of passage]] comparable to the [[Christian]] [[Confirmation]]. Nowadays non-religious coming-of-age ceremonies are organized in several European countries.

==Germany==
{{Main|Jugendweihe}}
Modern non-religious coming-of-age ceremonies originate in [[Germany]], where ''[[Jugendweihe]]'' (''"youth consecration"'', today occasionally known as ''Jugendfeier'', ''"youth ceremony"'') began in the 19th century. The activity was arranged by independent [[Freethought|freethinker]] organizations until 1954, when the [[Communist]] party of [[East Germany]] banned it in its old form and changed it to promote Communist ideology. In the [[East Germany|GDR]] Jugendweihe became, with the support of the state, the most popular form of coming-of-age ceremonies for the adolescents, replacing the Christian Confirmation. After the [[reunification of Germany]] the Jugendweihe-activity regained its independence from Communism, but the non-religious rite of passage had become a [[tradition]], and thus approximately 60-70% of youngsters in the eastern states still participate in it. The age for participating in the Jugendweihe is 13–14 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1516020,00.html |title=A Secular Rite of Passage |author=Walker, Tamsin  |publisher=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=2007-08-09|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the ceremony the youngsters attend specially arranged events or a course, in which they work on topics like [[history]] and [[multiculturalism]], [[culture]] and [[creativity]], [[civil rights]] and duties, [[nature]] and [[technology]], professions and getting a job, as well as [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]] and human relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jugendweihe.de/Jugendweihe.html |title=Jugendweihe Heute  |author=  |publisher=Jugendweihe Deutschland e.V. |accessdate=2007-11-15|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays there are many different groups organising Jugendweihes, but the most important ones are ''Jugendweihe Deutschland e. V.'', ''der Humanistische Verband Deutschland'' (''"the Humanist Association of Germany"''), ''der Freidenkerverband'' (''"the Freethinker Association"'') and ''die Arbeiterwohlfahrt'' (''"the Worker Welfare"'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jugendweihe.de/Geschichte-der-Jugendweihe.html |title=Geschichte der Jugendweihe |author=Krause, Klaus-Peter |publisher=Jugendweihe Deutschland e.V. |accessdate=2007-11-15 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526085247/http://www.jugendweihe.de/Geschichte-der-Jugendweihe.html |archivedate=2008-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norway==
''[[Human-Etisk Forbund]]'' (''The Norwegian Humanist Association'') has arranged non-religious confirmation courses in [[Norway]] since 1951. During the last ten years there has been rapid growth in the popularity of the course. In 2006 over 10500 youngsters, approximately 17% of the age group, chose the  ''humanistisk konfirmasjon'' or ''borgerlig konfirmasjon'' (''civil confirmation''). The course can be taken in the year of one's 15th birthday. Norwegians living abroad can take the course as [[correspondence course]] by e-mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.human.no/templates/Page____221.aspx |title=Konfirmasjon |date=2004-01-28 |author= |publisher=Human-Etisk Forbund |accessdate=2007-08-09 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411011617/http://www.human.no/templates/Page____221.aspx |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Human"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.human.no/templates/Page____6736.aspx |title=Humanist confirmation in Norway - a rite of passage has come of age |date = 
 |author=  |publisher=Human-Etisk Forbund |accessdate=2007-08-17|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Humanistforbundet]], not to be confused with HEF (Human-Etisk Forbund) has since 2006 arranged an alternative to HEF's confirmation. It is a non-religious civil confirmation based on academics. The program usually consists of several lectures by various prestigious, well-known and competent organisations like the [[Red Cross]], [[UNICEF]] and Dyrevernalliansen (a Norwegian animal welfare interest-organisation), people like [[Thomas Hylland Eriksen]] have also held lectures.

==Finland==

===Prometheus Camp===
{{Main|Prometheus camps}}
In [[Finland]] non-religious lower high school students planned a camp for a secular rite of passage as an alternative to the Christian Confirmation, and the first ''Prometheus-leiri'' (''Prometheus Camp'') was held in 1989 by the Finnish Philosophy and Life Stance teachers' coalition. The following year ''Prometheus-leirin tuki ry'' (''Prometheus Camp Association'') was founded for organising the week-long [[summer camp]]s. The ideology of the association is based on a [[Humanism|Humanist]] [[world view]], but it is politically and religiously non-aligned. One of the main principles of the activity is tolerance towards other peoples' [[life stance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.protu.fi/leirit/kysyttya.html#11 |title=Kysymyksiä ja vastauksia: Mikä on Prometheus-leirien arvopohja? |author= |publisher=Prometheus Camp Association |accessdate=2007-08-09 |language=Finnish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325033655/http://www.protu.fi/leirit/kysyttya.html#11 |archivedate=2007-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Prometheus-koru.jpg|100px|thumb|The Prometheus- medallion]]
The camp is primarily aimed at youngsters who do not belong to any religious denomination, but approximately 20% of yearly Prometheus Camp participants are members of some religious community, usually the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], and also participate in a Christian Confirmation. The usual age of participants in a Prometheus Camp is 14–15 years, but there are also "senior camps" for older youngsters. In recent years the yearly number of participants has been around 900, which is approximately 1,5% of the age group.

The themes in the Prometheus Camp are: differences, [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]]; [[drugs]], [[alcohol]] and [[Substance dependence|addiction]];  [[society]] and making a difference in it; the [[future]]; world views, ideologies and religions; [[personal relationship]]s and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]; and the [[Natural environment|environment]]. These topics are worked on in open discussions, debating, group work, small drama plays or  playing games. Every camp is organised and led by a team of seven members: two adults and five youngsters. At the end of the camp there is a Prometheus Ceremony, in which the participants perform a chronicle about their week for their friends and family. They also get a Prometheus-diploma, a silver coloured Prometheus-medallion and a crown of leaves that is bound by the camp leaders. Weekend-long continuation camps are arranged in the autumn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.protu.fi/english/aboutus.html |title=About Prometheus Camps |author=  | publisher=Prometheus Camp Association |accessdate=2007-08-09|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Annually one Prometheus-camp has been arranged in [[English language|English]], two in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and approximately 65 in [[Finnish language|Finnish]].

==Iceland==
In [[Iceland]] ''borgaraleg ferming'' (''civil confirmations'') are organised by ''[[Sidmennt|Siðmennt]]'', a Humanist association, as an alternative to the Christian Confirmation for the 13-year-old. Before the civil confirmation the youngsters take a preparation course about [[ethics]], personal relationships, human rights, equality, [[critical thinking]], relations between the sexes, prevention of [[substance abuse]], [[skepticism]], protecting the environment, getting along with parents, being a teenager in a consumer society, and what it means to be an adult and take responsibility for one's views and behavior. The course consists of 12 weekly group meetings, each lasting 1,5 hours. Youngsters living outside [[Reykjavík]] can take the course as a concentrated version during two weekends. The teachers of the course are usually philosophers. In the end of the course there is a formal graduation ceremony in which the participants receive diplomas, and some of them perform [[music]], [[poetry]] and [[speech]]es. There are also prominent members of Icelandic society giving speeches. An increasing number of youngsters have taken the course every year with 300 taking the course for the confirmation in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sidmennt.is/2014/01/16/300-ungmenni-hafa-skrad-sig-i-borgaralega-fermingu-sidmenntar-2014/ | title = Sidmennt, the Icelandic Ethical Humanist Association | publisher = Siðmennt| accessdate = 2014-01-16 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
The association ''[[Humanisterna]]'' (''The Humanists'') started secular coming-of-age courses in [[Sweden]] in the 1990s in the form of [[study circle]]s, but they were soon replaced by a week-long camp where the subjects are dealt with through discussions, games, group works and other activities. During the last years there has been approximately 100 participants annually in the ''Humanistisk konfirmation'' (''Humanist confirmation'') camps. The themes in the camp concern one's life stance, for example [[human rights]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], [[racism]], [[gender role]]s, [[love]], sexuality and lifestyles, but the topics under discussion depend on the participating youngsters' own choices. In the end of the camp there is a festive ceremony in which the participants demonstrate  to their families and relatives what they did during the week, through e.g. plays and songs. There are also speeches held by the organisators of the camp, the youngsters themselves, and invited speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.humanisterna.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=47 | title = Konfirmation: Livssynsläger för ungdomar i 15-årsåldern | publisher = Humanisterna | accessdate = 2007-08-09 | language = Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denmark==
The first civil confirmation in the [[Nordic countries]] was arranged in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] in 1915 by ''Foreningen mod Kirkelig Konfirmation'' (''Association Against Church Confirmation''). In 1924 the organisation changed its name to Forgeningen Borgelig Konfirmation (''The Association for Civil Confirmation'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historie-online.dk/special/konfirmation/borgerlig.htm Borgelig Konfirmation] (in Danish)&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil confirmation declined in the 1970s as central organized ceremonies, but instead they became increasingly more common as private celebrations and the civil confirmations are still common today in atheist families. They are also known as 'nonfirmations', but are now rarely linked to any associations.

== Czechoslovakia ==
During the communist era, young people were given identity cards at the age of 15 in a collective ceremony. At the age of nineteen boys were required to perform military service.

== United States and Canada ==
{{see also|Coming of Age (Unitarian Universalism)}}
Edifices of the [[Ethical movement]] in the United States perform secular coming of age ceremonies for 14-year-old members, in which, after spending a year performing community service activities and attending workshops regarding various topics concerning adulthood, the honoree and one's parent(s) speak before the congregation about their growth over the year. Similar ceremonies are performed by congregations of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] and [[Canadian Unitarian Council]].

The '''Society of Animal Artists''' is an international organization for [[artist]]s who paint, sculpt, or draw animals and wildlife, founded in 1960.

The Society of Animal Artists, Inc. (SAA) is "devoted to promoting excellence in the portrayal of the creatures sharing our planet, and to the education of the public through its informative [[art]] seminars, lectures and teaching demonstrations. Some of the finest animal artists from the United States, Canada, Europe, Africa, Japan, and Australia are represented in the Society's membership." &lt;ref name="object of society"&gt;[http://www.societyofanimalartists.com/info.html Society of Animal Artists Official Website: Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society holds an annual exhibition, "Art &amp; the Animal", which premieres at museum venues. &lt;ref name="society exhibition"&gt;[http://uknow.uky.edu/content/art-and-animal-captures-uk-art-museum-spotlight Article: 'Art and the Animal' Captures UK Art Museum Spotlight]&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the exhibition is shown on tour around the United States.  [http://www.davidjwagnerllc.com/ Dr. David J. Wagner] is the current Tour Director and Curator for the Society of Animal Artists.  The Society celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2010 with their exhibition at the San Diego Natural History Museum in San Diego, CA. A complete history of the SAA's exhibition can be found on their website.

The Society of Animal Artists is recognized as a 501(c)3 charitable organization by the I.R.S. and all contributions to the Society are tax-deductible''

==Introduction==
The Society of Animal Artists is an organization of artists who produce the best animal art in the world. The mission of the Society of Animal Artists is to promote excellence in the portrayal of domesticated and wild animals in art. The upshot of this nexus of talent and mission, is that artworks created by members of the Society of Animal Artists have established new standards of excellence in fine art, and that the Annual Exhibition of the Society of Animal Artists and its traveling exhibition, Art and the Animal, have become the standard by which all others are measured. The Society of Animal Artists has an historical affinity with organizations that grew out of a movement to form associations and clubs dedicated to art in the 19th century. Like the National Academy of Design and other such organizations, the Society of Animal Artists is mandated by its bylaws to organize annual exhibitions to ensure new, strong and fresh artwork and afford its members with ample display opportunities. It is also worth noting that the Society of Animal Artists was founded in response to an exhibition entitled Animals in the Bronx Zoo, held at Burr Galleries in New York, because this established an historical affinity with the conservation movement, which various members have supported ever since, not only through the ecological message of their artwork but also through generous contributions and sales.

==History==

===Founding and early years===
In the 1950s, individuals from the New York metropolitan area who liked to meet and paint at the Bronx Zoo &lt;ref&gt;Bronx Zoo https://bronxzoo.com/&lt;/ref&gt; together staged "Animals in the Bronx Zoo" at the Burr Gallery sponsored by the New York Zoological Society.&lt;ref&gt;New York Zoological Society https://www.wcs.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Allen Bott and Guido Borghi were inspired to form the organization after an enthusiastic reception to this exhibition. The fledgling Society soon became a member of the renowned [[Salmagundi Club]], and established an office in their building at 47 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY. Early Exhibitions were held in various galleries such as Sportsman’s Edge, Grand Central Art Galleries and the Alder Gallery (All in New York City). 
In addition to Bott and Borghi, early members included: Elizabeth Rungius Felda [Sister of Carl Rungius], Paul Bransom, John Clymer, Gifford Cochran, Brenda Frey, Anna Hyatt Huntington, Gertude K. Lathrop, Robert Lougheed, Ugo Mochi, Clement Weisbecker and Walter Wilwerding.

===Catalogs and exhibitions===
The first SAA catalog, produced in 1978 for the exhibition at Sportsman’s Edge Gallery, consisted of 8 pages and was black and white. In 1979, the SAA had its first actual Annual Exhibition opening (again at Sportsman’s Edge), with formal programs and events. A 20 page black and white catalog was produced. In 1980, the "Society of Animal Artists Exhibition/Convention" was hosted by Game Conservation International at the Four Seasons Plaza Nacional Hotel, San Antonio, TX. A 28 page, black and white catalog was produced. The first four-color catalog (44 pages) was produced in 1990, for the 30th Annual Exhibition at St. Hubert’s Giralda, NJ.

The SAA has hosted annual exhibitions since 1960 with the exhibition first being named "Art and the Animal" in 1988. The first museum venue was the Academy of Sciences in Philadelphia in 1981. In 1988 the Society recruited David J. Wagner to create and manage tours of artworks selected from annual exhibitions and to secure hosts for its annual exhibitions. SAA exhibitions have been displayed throughout the United States, with approximately 70% of hosting venues having been art museums or general museums that have included art as an integral dimension of their core mission. Over the years, the SAA’s work has been on display at more than 100 different institutions across the United States—and once in Canada in 1995 at the Old Algonquin Museum, Algonquin Park, Ontario.

      <comment>/* In chemistry */ Sigh. This again: part of [[Chemical nomenclature]], they → part of [[chemical nomenclature]], they</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3389">A '''systematic name''' is a name given in a systematic way to one unique group, organism, object or [[chemical substance]], out of a specific population or collection. Systematic names are usually part of a [[nomenclature]].

A '''semisystematic name''' or '''semitrivial name''' is a name that has at least one systematic part and at least one [[trivial name|trivial]] part.
&lt;ref&gt;Stedman's Medical Dictionary: [http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?semisystematic+name ''semisystematic name'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=semisystematic name (semitrivial name)|file=S05601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creating systematic names can be as simple as assigning a [[prefix]] or a number to each object (in which case they are a type of [[numbering scheme]]), or as complex as encoding the complete structure of the object in the name. Many systems combine some information about the named object with an extra sequence number to make it into a [[unique identifier]].

Systematic names often co-exist with earlier common names assigned before the creation of any systematic naming system. For example, many common chemicals are still referred to by their common or trivial names, even by chemists.

==In chemistry==
In chemistry, a systematic name describes the chemical structure of a [[chemical substance]], thus giving some information about its chemical properties.

The ''[[Compendium of Chemical Terminology]]'' published by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] defines systematic name as "a name composed wholly of specially coined or selected syllables, with or without numerical prefixes; e.g. pentane, oxazole."&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=systematic name|file=S06236}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when trivial names have become part of [[chemical nomenclature]], they can be the systematic name of a substance or part of it. Examples for some systematic names that have trivial origins are [[benzene]] (cyclohexatriene) or [[glycerol]] (trihydroxypropane).

==Examples==
There are standardized systematic or semi-systematic names for:
* [[Systematic element name|Chemical elements]] (following [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] guidelines)
* [[Chemical nomenclature]] (following IUPAC guidelines)
* [[Binomial nomenclature]], initiated by [[Carl Linnaeus]]
* [[Astronomical naming conventions|Astronomical objects and entities]] (administered by the [[International Astronomical Union]])
* [[Gene nomenclature|Genes]] (following [[HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee]] procedures)
* [[List of proteins|Proteins]]
* [[List of minerals (complete)|Minerals]] (administered by the [[International Mineralogical Association|IMA]])
*[[Nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies|Monoclonal antibodies]]

'''Te Māngai Pāho''' (the Māori Broadcast Funding Agency) is the New Zealand [[Crown entity]] responsible for the promotion of the [[Māori language]] and [[Māori culture]] by providing funding for Māori-language programming on radio, and television. It was established in 1989 under the name {{lang|mi|Te Reo Whakapuaki Irirangi|ital=no}}, and is administered by the [[Ministry of Justice (New Zealand)|Ministry of Justice]], but uses the name {{lang|mi|Te Māngai Pāho|italic=no}} or '''TMP''' in official publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0025/latest/whole.html Broadcasting Act]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/d/directory-of-official-information-archive/directory-of-official-information-december-2009/alphabetical-list-of-entries-1/t/te-reo-whakapuaki-irirangi-maori-broadcasting-funding-agency Māori Broadcasting Funding Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tmp.govt.nz/&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation was established and is retained under the commitment of successive Governments to broadcasting rights under the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], and recognises the Māori language as a taonga or treasure that must be actively protected and supported. It claims to be "dedicated to the sustained regeneration and promotion of Māori language and culture" through making wise investment decisions, contestable funding processes and the promotion of Māori music.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmp.govt.nz/about|title=About|publisher=Te Māngai Pāho|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011131450/http://www.tmp.govt.nz/about|archivedate=11 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates alongside general broadcasting funding body [[NZ On Air]].

As the primary funding body of Māori media, the agency funds the operation of a national network of 21 iwi-run radio stations, that must each deliver eight hours of Māori language content each day. It also provides funding to [[Māori Television]] and sister channel [[Te Reo (TV)|Te Reo]] to produce local programming in-house and acquire local and overseas programmes that are likely to interest Māori audiences in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmp.govt.nz/why-we-are-here|title=Why we are here|publisher=Te Māngai Pāho}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==

[[TVNZ 1]], [[TVNZ 2]], [[Three (New Zealand)|Three]], [[Prime Television New Zealand|Prime TV]] and [[Sky Television (New Zealand)|Sky TV]] programming is eligible for Te Māngai Pāho funding. The agency has previously funded bilingual content, outdoor broadcasts of Māori events, sports coverage with Māori language commentaries, Māori language children's programming, daily news and current affairs and other programmes.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

===TVNZ Māori and Pacific===

Flagship daily Māori language news programme [[Te Karere]] began in 1983 and has been funded by Te Māngai Pāho since its inception in 1989. The programme covers news of national significance that relates to a specifically Māori audience. It is presented by Scotty Morrison and produced by Tini Molyneux and Tina Wickliffe, with senior reporter Hinerangi Goodman and substitute host Peata Melbourne. The programme broadcasts on TVNZ 1 at 3:55&amp;nbsp;pm, and is repeated with subtitles at 1&amp;nbsp;am and 5:35&amp;nbsp;am the following day, and is available online through live streaming and on-demand services.

Until the end of 2014, the [[Television New Zealand|TVNZ]] Māori and Pacific department operated primarily to produce programmes that have received Te Māngai Pāho funding. Long-running bi-lingual current affairs programme [[Marae (TV series)|Marae]] was one such programme. Presenters Scottie Morrison and Miriama Kamo introduced debates and panel discussions about Māori politics and longer-form stories about the Māori world. For most of its existence, the programme has been broadcast alongside English-subtitled Māori language documentary series [[Waka Huia]], which was distributed around the world as an archival record of the Māori way of life.

===Māori Television===

[[Māori Television]] began broadcasting around New Zealand 28 March 2004 from a base in [[Newmarket, New Zealand|Newmarket]], and makes a significant contribution to the revitalisation of the [[Māori language]] and [[Tikanga Māori|culture]] through its programming. Its mission under legislation is to revitalise [[Maori language]] and culture through providing high-quality, cost-effective Māori television, in both Māori and English languages, in a way that informs, educates, and entertains a broad viewing audience and therefore enriches New Zealand's society, culture, and heritage.

The flagship Māori Television attracts 1.5&amp;nbsp;million viewers each month, half of all Māori aged five or more, and one third of all New Zealanders. Current affairs show Native Affairs, sports coverage and international films and documentaries are among the highest-rating programmes on the channel.&lt;ref name="Throng"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.throng.co.nz/maori-television/maori-television-marks-fifth-onair-anniversary|title=Maori Television Marks Fifth On-Air Anniversary|date=26 March 2009|work=Throng|accessdate=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Te Reo is the company's second channel, launched 28 March 2008. Its contents is entirely in the Māori language with no advertising or subtitles, with many programmes being iwi-specific or geared towards fluent Māori language speakers. It also rebroadcasts or simulcasts many of Māori Television's Māori language programming, including daily news programme Te Kaea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maoritelevision.com/latestnews/maori_television_launch_second_channel.htm|title=Te Reo|publisher=Māori Television|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124030625/http://www.maoritelevision.com/latestnews/maori_television_launch_second_channel.htm|archivedate=24 January 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==

Te Māngai Pāho funds the operation of a network of [[bilingual]] English and Māori language radio stations targeting members of local iwi and the wider public through local frequencies and online streaming. It operates as [[Te Whakaruruhau o Ngā Reo Irirangi Māori]], the Iwi Radio Network, currently chaired by former [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance]] MP [[Willie Jackson (politician)|Willie Jackson]].

Programming on these stations includes national and local news coverage, music, educational programming, comedy, drama and programmes that teach the Māori language. These stations update listeners on iwi news and events, and promote Māori language and culture. Each station includes local shows, personalities and breakfast programmes.

Tahu FM, based in [[Christchurch]], is also available on [[SKY TV (New Zealand)|Sky]] digital 423.

The main theme of ''Think of Lampedusa'' refers to the [[2013 Lampedusa migrant shipwreck|2013 shipwreck]] of some 500 illegal African migrants near the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]], that killed 366 persons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prix de poésie Tchicaya U Tam'si, L'Ivoirien Josué Guébo remporte à Assilah l’édition 2014|url=http://www.lematin.ma/express/2014/-prix-de-poesie-tchicaya-u-tam-si-_l-ivoirien-josue-guebo-remporte-a-assilah-l-edition-2014/207597.html|website=lematin.ma|language=fr|date=17 August 2014|access-date=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

It describes the reasons for emigration, the conditions under which journeys are made and the often dramatic consequences of these adventures.
The poet, using both [[mythological]] and [[historical]] elements, questions in this work complex realities about the [[nature]] of man and his [[Identity (social science)|identity]].

==Summary==
''Think of Lampedusa'' is the story of hundreds of [[young people]], of various [[religions]], who leave from [[Libya]], [[Somalia]], [[Eritrea]] or [[Mali]] towards Europe and most of whom perish during the crossing. Those who escape the depths of the ocean and reach the [[Lampedusa|island of Lampedusa]], will face the [[electric fence]] of [[hate]].

It is also, through time and space, a rewrite with a touch of [[irony]], the [[Iliad]] as well as the [[Odyssey]] and in a general way, the myth of Ulysses.

==Style==
''Think of Lampedusa'' is a [[Poems|collection of poems]] that presents itself as a single text. The work appears as a verse for a story and therefore holds both [[poetry]] and [[narration]]. It uses in places, [[Anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphora]] and [[allegories]].

The author presents [[memories]] but also expectations through a hike that leads him through [[sea]], [[dream]], [[raft]], [[anxiety]] and [[Shipwrecking|sinking]].

A '''watch strap''', '''watch band,''' or '''watch bracelet''' is a [[bracelet]] that straps a [[wrist watch]] onto the wrist.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/british/watchstrap&lt;/ref&gt; Watch straps may be made of [[leather]], [[plastic]], [[rubber]], [[cloth]], or [[metal]], sometimes in combination. It can be regarded as a [[fashion]] item, serving both a utilitarian and decorative function. Some metal watch straps may be [[metal plating|plated]] with, or even in rare cases made of, [[precious metal]]s.

Watch straps may close with a [[buckle]] or a [[folding clasp]]. Expanding watch straps are designed to expand elastically, often by the use of metal springs in a segmented design, and may be slipped on like a bracelet. Attachment points for the strap to the watch are largely standardized, with a spring-loaded double-ended pin used to anchor the watch strap to holes in a bracket that is integral to the [[watch case]], allowing worn watch straps to be replaced or swapped with new straps for fashion purposes.

Both metal watch cases, and watch straps incorporating metal parts can sometimes cause [[contact dermatitis]] in susceptible individuals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/contact-dermatitis/basics/symptoms/con-20032048&lt;/ref&gt; Special anti-allergy watch straps, like a NATO style watch strap, which shield the skin from exposure to metal parts, are available for sufferers of this type of dermatitis.

Specialist expanding watch straps exist for use with [[diving watch]]es. With increasing depth and rising water pressure the (sleeved) wrist of a diver is exposed to compression effects that have a shrinking effect on the wrist circumference. Many watch straps intended for diving watches have rippled or vented sections near the attachment points on the watch case to facilitate the required flexibility to strap the watch exaggeratedly tight for normal wear at the surface whilst keeping the watch adequately tight in place on the diver's wrist at depth.

'''''William's Doll''''' is a 1972 children's [[picture book]] by [[Charlotte Zolotow]] about a boy who wants a [[doll]] even though dolls typically are considered [[gender role|a toy only for girls]]. His father, uncomfortable with William's request, tries giving William toys the father considers more [[gender]]-appropriate, such as a [[basketball]] and a [[train set]]; while William enjoys these toys, he continues to ask for a doll. Eventually, the boy's grandmother fulfills the request, explaining to the father that William will use the doll to practice being a good father.

Zolotow has explained that although she is a [[feminist]] and appreciates that many feminists enjoyed the book's message, her inspiration was more from personal observations about her husband's early attempts to bond with the couple's son, Stephen, and about how men of the time period missed out on some of the pleasures of being closely involved with their children's development. She observed, for example, that by always exiting the room during diaper changes, her husband missed their son's first smile.&lt;ref name="zolotowcom"&gt;[http://www.charlottezolotow.com/willilams_doll.htm Charlotte Zolotow on the origins of ''William's Doll''], charlottezolotow.com (retrieved June 1, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The book often is used in the United States for lessons on gender roles, [[stereotype]]s, or general anti-[[bias]] education. For example, the journal article "'William's Doll' Revisited" was on a study comparing reactions of [[fourth grade|fourth-grade]] students in 1975 and in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greever |first=Ellen A. |last2=Austin |first2=Patricia |last3=Welhousen |first3=Karyn |date=March 2000 |title='William's Doll' Revisited |journal=Language Arts |volume=77 |issue=4 |pages=324–30 |format=PDF |issn=0360-9170 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |url=http://www.csun.edu/~bashforth/305_PDF/305_ME2/305_Language&amp;Gender/WilliamsDollRevisitedAcross20Years_LA2000.pdf |laysource=[[Education Resources Information Center]] |laysummary=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ603237&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ603237 |laydate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
A song based on the story, with music by [[Mary Rodgers]] and lyrics by [[Sheldon Harnick]], was included in the best-selling ''[[Free to Be... You and Me]]'' children's [[album]] and [[songbook]] in 1972, where it was sung by [[Alan Alda]] and [[Marlo Thomas]]. (This same song was sung by [[B. D. Wong]] at the [[Ms. Foundation]]'s 15th Annual Gloria Awards ceremony in 2003, where Marlo Thomas and former Ms. Foundation president Letty Cottin Pogrebin received the Creative Philanthropy Award for the album's creation.&lt;ref name="mcsr"&gt;[http://www.mencanstoprape.org/info-url2699/info-url_show.htm?doc_id=170569 "Yoko Ono Presents Award"] (undated article, retrieved June 1, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;)

When ''Free to Be... You and Me'' became a television special in [[1974 in television|1974]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] asked producer Marlo Thomas to make two changes to the material, one of which involved the Zolotow story:
{{Cquote|They wanted ''William's Doll'' cut, because it would turn every boy in the world into a homosexual &amp;mdash; which isn't such a bad idea. And the other issue was "Parents Are People." Harry Belafonte sang the man part and I sang the female part, and we were walking down Fifth Avenue pushing baby buggies and ABC said it wouldn't play in the South. It looked like we were married. ... Thankfully, 'That Girl' was a hit on ABC at the time, so I had a little clout. Both things stayed in.|20px|20px|Marlo Thomas|''Forward'', May 28, 2004&lt;ref name="jccny"&gt;Majorie Ingall, [http://www.jccmanhattan.org/category.aspx?catid=1795 "The East Village Mamele; Why 'Free to Be...' Still Kicks Butt,"] ''Forward'', [[Jewish Community Center|JCC Manhattan]], May 28, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''William's Doll'' also became a 14-minute film in [[1981 in film|1981]].&lt;ref name="zolotowcom"/&gt; The 1981 film starred Craig Salles as William and was shot in Graceada Park in Modesto, California. In [[2010 in film|2010]], the producers of [[RiffTrax]], formerly [[Mystery Science Theater 3000]], released ''William's Doll''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rifftrax.com/shorts/williams-doll William's Doll]. rifftrax.com&lt;/ref&gt;  This was their "riff" of the aforementioned short.
