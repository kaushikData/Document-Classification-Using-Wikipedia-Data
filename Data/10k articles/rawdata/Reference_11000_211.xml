'''Alibris''' is an online store that sells new books, [[used book]]s, [[out-of-print book]]s, rare books, and other media through an online network of [[independent bookstore|independent booksellers]].

== History ==
Alibris was founded in 1997 by [[Martin Manley]] and incorporated in 1998. It grew out of Interloc, an online company founded by antiquarian bookseller Richard Weatherford in 1994.{{Better source|reason=Citation is the Alibris company website; there must be more objective sources for this.|date=October 2018}} Interloc was one of the earliest successful efforts to centralize used book data online.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} It remained a private network until 1996, when the company launched its website. The company was backed by venture capital until 2006, when it was purchased by [[Oak Hill Capital Partners]], a [[private equity firm]]. In February 2010, Oak Hill Capital Partners bought Monsoon and merged it with Alibris with Monsoon Commerce owning Alibris.&lt;ref name=tie&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oregon.tie.org/event/40/mentor-connect-kanth-gopalpur|title=Mentor Connect with Kanth Gopalpur|publisher=[[TiE|TiE Oregon]]|accessdate=January 31, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221104657/https://oregon.tie.org/event/40/mentor-connect-kanth-gopalpur|archive-date=2014-02-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2017, Alibris was owned by AM Holding Inc. (formerly Monsoon Commerce Inc.){{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

== Company ==
Booksellers list their inventories on Alibris which in turn offers the books on its retail [[website]], a separate library services site, and business-to-business partners such as [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], [[Books-A-Million]], and [[Chapters|Chapters Indigo]]. It also offers services in the UK with the [[Waterstones]] market place. It offers more than 150 million books from a network of over 15,000 booksellers in 65 countries.

Most sales made through Alibris are fulfilled by the bookseller directly to the end customer. Sales to libraries or other institutions or books needing transoceanic shipping are consolidated in a distribution center in [[Sparks, Nevada]]. Alibris also has a similar network for music ([[record album|albums]], [[cassette tapes]], and [[CDs]]) and movies ([[VHS]] or [[DVD]]).

Alibris allows customers to buy and sell at the same time. Alibris charges a starting fee that varies based on what is being sold and what kind of commission is charged.

Alibris was a charter member of the [[Google eBooks]] service when it was announced by Google on December 6, 2010.&lt;ref name="googebook2010"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/12/discover-more-than-3-million-google.html | title= Discover more than 3 million Google eBooks from your choice of booksellers and devices | work= Official blog | publisher=[[Google]] | date= December 6, 2010| accessdate=2010-12-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101207022646/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/12/discover-more-than-3-million-google.html| archivedate= 7 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Torhalle_Kloster_Lorsch.jpg|thumb|250px|Carolingian gate hall of the former [[Lorsch Abbey|abbey at Lorsch]]]]
'''''Annales Laurissenses minores'''''  ({{lang-de|Kleine Lorscher Annalen}}) or '''ALM''' is the Latin name of a medieval, historiographic text from the [[Lorsch Abbey|abbey at Lorsch]] near [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in [[Germany]]. In many German texts, the they are also called the ''Kleine Lorscher Frankenchronik'' ("Short Lorsch Chronicle of the Franks"), but in English may be referred to as the "Short chronicle of Lorsch"&lt;ref&gt;Kaschke and Sören, "Chronicon Laurissense Breve" in ''Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle'', edited by Graeme Dunphy and Cristian Bratu, 17 Oct 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; or "Lesser Annals of Lorsch".&lt;ref&gt;This name was probably introduced by [[Georg Waitz]]: ''Chronicon breve Francorum Laurissense''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
The chronicle was written in the early 9th century AD by a monk at Lorsch Abbey. The name of the author is unknown. In chronological annual reports he describes events in the [[Frankish Empire]] during the 8th century, for example, its transition from [[Merovingian]] to [[Carolingian]] rule. The chronicle begins at the year 680 and ends at the year 817.&lt;ref&gt;Start of the ''Annales Laurissenses minores'' in the MGH: [http://www.mgh.de/dmgh/resolving/MGH_SS_1_S._114 p. 114]. End of the ''Annales Laurissenses minores'' in the MGH: [http://www.mgh.de/dmgh/resolving/MGH_SS_1_S._123 p. 123]&lt;/ref&gt; From 680 to 741 its contents are taken from the [[Fredegar]] Chronicle. From 741 to 788 the reports are partly original, but are based partly on the ''[[Annales Laurissenses maiores]]'' ("Great Lorsch Annals" or'' Große Lorscher Annalen'').&lt;ref&gt;The Great Lorsch Annals are usually referred to today as the ''[[Reichsannalen]]'' or ''[[Annales regni Francorum]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; From 788 the records in the ''Codex Fuldensis'' differ from those in the ''[[Codex Remensis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the ''annales Laurissenses minores'' in the MGH: [http://www.mgh.de/dmgh/resolving/MGH_SS_1_S._112 p. 112]&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the surviving manuscripts were once found in [[Fulda]] and [[Reims]], hence their present names. Later they were taken to [[Vienna]] and [[Berne]].&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the ''Annales Laurissenses minores'' in the MGH: [http://www.mgh.de/dmgh/resolving/MGH_SS_1_S._112 pp. 112ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Short Lorsch Chronicle was subsequently used as a source by the authors of the [[Annals of Fulda]] (''Annales Fuldenses''). 

The ''Annales Laurissenses minores'' should not be confused with the [[Annals of Lorsch]] (''Annales Laureshamenses'').

The '''Aristotle Metadata Registry''' (or Aristotle-MDR) is an [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[Metadata Registry]] framework based on the [[ISO/IEC 11179]] standard for Metadata Registries. It is influenced by the [[METeOR|AIHW Meteor Metadata Registry]]&lt;ref name='launch'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iassist2015.pop.umn.edu/program/block2#a3 |title=Aristotle Metadata Registry - A new contender for government metadata management

Aristotle-MDR is designed to describe data holdings databases and associated [[Metadata#Metadata types|structural metadata]]. The Aristotle Metadata Registry was publicly launched at the [[IASSIST|2015 IASSIST Conference]] in Toronto.&lt;ref name="launch" /&gt; In 2016, the founders of the Aristotle Metadata Registry were hired by [[NICTA|Data61]] (a division of [[CSIRO]]) to continue development of the platform.

In June 2018, the CSIRO and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare entered an agreement to replace the current METeOR metadata registry with a system build on the Aristotle Metadata Registry
&lt;ref name='replace-a'&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aihw.gov.au/about-our-data/metadata-standards |title=Replacement METeOR system |publisher=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare |access-date=2018-11-03 |quote=In June 2018, AIHW signed a contract with CSIRO to replace the existing METeOR technical platform.

== Extension API ==
Aristotle-MDR implements the object-oriented nature of ISO/IEC 11179
that has allowed the community to build extensions to the original metadata scope of ISO/IEC 11179.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metadata-standards.org/11179/ |title=ISO/IEC 11179-3 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=  |publisher=ISO |access-date=2016-04-01 |quote=It is not expected that this metamodel will completely accommodate all users. Particular sectors, such as document management, scientific data and statistical data, require metadata attributes not addressed in this standard. This standard provides Slots (see 7.2.2.4) as a mechanism to extend metadata items with custom attributes. Classes, relationships, and attributes may be added as extensions to existing packages in this conceptual data model, or complete new packages may be added.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current additional metadata types provided by the community include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/aristotle-mdr/aristotle-metadata-registry/wiki/Available-Extensions |title=Aristotle Metadata Registry Extensions }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:
* [[Health indicator]] and [[Performance Indicator]] types to record population-level health and equality indicators such as those collected by the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] and the [[World Health Organization]]
* A [[Data Catalog Vocabulary|DCAT]] compatible extension to support [[Data set]] specifications to record columnar datasets
* Download formats for [[Data Documentation Initiative]] and [[DHIS]]

'''Frank Donald Goodish''' (June 18, 1946 – July 17, 1988) was an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] who earned his greatest fame under the [[ring name]] '''Bruiser Brody'''.  As a wrestler, he helped innovate the "brawling" style and was infamous for his wild and legitimately uncooperative demeanor.

==Early life==
Goodish was an All-State football and basketball player at [[Warren High School (Warren, Michigan)|Warren High School, Michigan]], and played football at [[West Texas A&amp;M University]] (then known as West Texas State) and with the [[Washington Redskins]] in the [[National Football League|NFL]].

== Professional wrestling career ==
After attending West Texas A&amp;M and working as a sportswriter Goodish was trained to wrestle by Fritz Von Erich ( Jack Adkisson ). He first wrestled in Dallas - Fort Worth and later Louisiana. As '''Bruiser Brody''' and '''King Kong Brody''', Goodish competed as a freelancer in several companies including the [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]] (CSW), [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF), [[Southwest Championship Wrestling]] (SCW), [[Windy City Pro Wrestling|Windy City Wrestling]], [[World Wrestling Council]] (WWC), [[Deep South Wrestling]] (DSW), [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] (CWF), [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), and [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW). In the States, he had numerous feuds with the likes of [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala the Ugandan Giant]], [[Abdullah the Butcher]], and [["Crusher" Jerry Blackwell]]. In Japan, he was in a tag team with [[Stan Hansen]]. Brody had a reputation for refusing to [[Job (professional wrestling)|job]] to other wrestlers. He also competed under the moniker of '''Red River Jack''' in Texas, during an angle against [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart's]] men and [[Skandor Akbar]]'s Army in World Class Championship Wrestling. Brody also competed as '''the Masked Marauder''' at one time in the AWA. In 1976, he went to [[Vince McMahon, Sr.|Vince J. McMahon's]] WWWF where he challenged WWWF Champion [[Bruno Sammartino]] but was unsuccessful in winning the championship. Brody also teamed with [[Big John Studd]]. It was also in the WWWF where he wrestled Invader 1 (Jose Gonzales), whom he refused to [[sell (professional wrestling)|sell]] for.

In 1985, he had a very short stint with [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW) in a feud with [[Antonio Inoki]] and many of their matches ended in no contests or disqualifications. In 1987, Brody began working primarily for the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico after getting fired from New Japan. Brody continued his feud with Abdullah the Butcher, as well as engaging in a feud with [[Carlos Colon]]. He briefly returned to [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] to win his last [[NWA International Heavyweight Championship]]. On April 15, 1988, the first attempt to form what became the [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship]] was done when Brody faced off against [[NWA United National Championship|NWA United National]] and [[PWF Heavyweight Championship|PWF]] champion [[Genichiro Tenryu]]; the result was a double countout. Brody lost the title to [[Jumbo Tsuruta]] four days later. In WCCW in Texas he was actually a babyface, most often against Abdullah The Butcher. However against Abdullah in Montreal he was a heel managed by Floyd Creatchman. While there Tim "Killer" Brooks acted as his brother Buster Brody. In St. Louis for a short time he was popular in a NWA world title match against [[Ric Flair]], which went to a one-hour draw. Brody was in an ongoing feud with The Russian Brute who later went on to AWA fame with Manager Ox Baker. Due to his huge reputation in Japan promoter [[Giant Baba|Shohei Baba]] had the match taped and later aired on Japanese TV.

In Florida he beat [[B. Brian Blair]] for the Florida State championship. Brody had an infamous cage match with [[Lex Luger]] in Florida in January 1986. In the middle of the match, Brody stopped "[[Work (professional wrestling)|work]]ing" and stood around. Luger and [[Bill Alfonso]], the referee of the match, were puzzled and attempted to speak to Brody who did not respond. Luger and Alfonso decided to forgo the planned finish of the match and Alfonso disqualified Luger in a spot where Luger continually punched Brody in a corner and did not back off. After the match, Luger recalls asking Brody if he did anything wrong to upset him, to which Brody responded "no", and Brody's reasons for not working were not very clear, stating that "the match just wasn't working". In [[Larry Matysik]]'s book, ''Wrestling at the Chase'', Matysik states that before the match Brody told him "I'm not putting up with any of his bullshit" and that Brody was upset that Luger would not sell for him. However, when watching the match, it is clear that Luger did sell for Brody. In a later shoot interview, Bill Alfonso said that there was a miscommunication issue on who would lead the match and there was no ill will ever between the two. Another scenario was that Brody was upset with the promoters over his paychecks (Brody had a contentious history with wrestling promoters for much of his career) and decided to embarrass the promotion by being uncooperative in the match. In 1987 he returned to the AWA where he fought Greg Gagne and Jerry Blackwell. Despite his reputation as being disagreeable with promotors he would aid any who needed a boost in ticket sales as he was guaranteed to bring in crowds. While working for WCCW in Texas he was the booker and produced their TV program.

== Personal life ==
Prior to his wrestling career, Goodish worked as a sportswriter in San Antonio, Texas. Goodish was married on June 4, 1968, to Nola Marie Neece;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/25456?c=search&amp;first=Frank&amp;last=Goodish|title=Free Family Tree, Genealogy and Family History - MyHeritage|author=|date=|website=www.familytreelegends.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the marriage ended in divorce on October 12, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/31992?c=search&amp;first=Frank&amp;last=Goodish|title=Free Family Tree, Genealogy and Family History - MyHeritage|author=|date=|website=www.familytreelegends.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodish's second wife, New Zealand born Barbara Smith remained with him until his death in 1988. They lived in Texas. Together they had a son named Geoffrey Dean, born November 7, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/20902?c=search&amp;first=geoffrey&amp;last=goodish|title=Free Family Tree, Genealogy and Family History - MyHeritage|author=|date=|website=www.familytreelegends.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On July 16, 1988, Brody was in the locker room before his scheduled match with [[Dan Spivey]] in [[Bayamón]] (a city near [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]), when [[José González (wrestler)|José Huertas González]], a fellow wrestler and booker,&lt;ref name="Foley, Mick p.115"&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.115)&lt;/ref&gt; allegedly asked him to step into the shower area to discuss business. There was an argument between the two wrestlers and a scuffle ensued, and the way the dressing room was designed, nobody saw what actually happened, followed by two screams, loud enough for the entire locker room to hear. [[Tony Atlas]] ran to the shower and saw Brody bent over and holding his stomach. Atlas then looked up at González and saw him holding a knife.&lt;ref name=atlasTMTS&gt;Atlas, Tony. ''ATLAS Too Much ... Too Soon''. Crowbar Press. (p.197-205) {{ISBN|978-0-9844090-2-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the heavy traffic outdoors and large crowd in the stadium it took paramedics close to an hour to reach Brody. When the paramedics arrived, Atlas helped carry Brody downstairs to the waiting ambulance as, due to Brody's enormous stature, paramedics were unable to lift him. He later died from his stab wounds. González (a US citizen) claimed self-defense and testified on his own defense.  He was acquitted of murder in 1989, because the prosecution witnesses who did not live in Puerto Rico didn't show up, claiming that they did not receive their summons until after the trial had ended.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4787">The '''Building Performance Database''' ('''BPD''') is an anonymized database that contains [[energy use intensity]] data for hundreds of thousands of buildings in the [[United States]]. It is built by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] in the [[United States]] and maintained by the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bpd.lbl.gov|title = DOE Building Performance Database|accessdate = June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/building-performance-database|title = Building Performance Database|publisher = [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], [[United States]]|accessdate = June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can examine specific building types and geographic areas, compare performance trends among similar buildings, identify and prioritize cost-saving energy efficiency improvements, and assess the range of likely savings from these improvements. 

==History==

Prior to its launch, the BPD was described in a conference presentation by Elena Alschuler and Cody Taylor from October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/ab758/documents/2012-10-08-09_workshop/presentations/Day-2/DOE_Buildings_Performance_Database_Overview_2012-10-09.pdf|title = DOE Building Technologies Program|last = Alschuler|first = Elena|last2 = Taylor|first2 = Cody|publisher = [[California Energy Commission]]|date = October 9, 2012|accessdate = June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another presentation by Alschuler in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aceee.org/files/pdf/conferences/eeff/2013/Alschuler_5A.pdf|title = Unlocking the Value of Empirical Building Performance Data|last = Alschuler|first = Elena|date = May 15, 2013|accessdate = June 20, 2014|publisher = [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BPD was launched in June 2013 with data from over 60,000 commercial and residential buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energymanagertoday.com/free-building-performance-database-includes-60000-records-092854/|title = Free Building Performance Database Includes 60,000 Records|last = Hardesty|first = Linda|date = June 18, 2013|accessdate = June 20, 2014|publisher = Energy Manager Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.energysquad.com/blog/posts/products-and-brands/doe-launches-buildings-performance-database|title = DOE Launches Buildings Performance Database|last = Stern|first = Soriana|date = June 27, 2013|accessdate = June 20, 2014|publisher = EnergySquad|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20140620165558/http://www.energysquad.com/blog/posts/products-and-brands/doe-launches-buildings-performance-database|archivedate = June 20, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A factsheet put out by the [[White House Press Room]] on May 28, 2014 cited the Building Performance Database as an example of a success story, saying that it has exceeded a milestone of 750,000 building records, making it the world’s largest public database of real buildings’ energy performance information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/05/28/fact-sheet-harnessing-power-data-clean-secure-and-reliable-energy-future|title = FACT SHEET: Harnessing the Power of Data for a Clean, Secure, and Reliable Energy Future|date = May 28, 2014|accessdate = June 20, 2014|publisher = [[White House Press Room]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/white-house-touts-energy-data-as-an-important-national-resource|title = Is the White House’s Open Data Strategy Working for Energy?|last = Lacey|first = Stephen|date = June 2, 2014|accessdate = June 20, 2014|publisher = Green Tech Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/207394-feds-ramp-up-energy-climate-data-programs|title=Feds ramp up energy, climate data programs|last = Cama|first = Timothy|date = May 28, 2014|accessdate = June 20, 2014|publisher = ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data and API==

The BPD has an [[application programming interface]] (API) that can return the [[energy use intensity]] for any group of buildings defined by an API request. The BPD contains business proprietary and confidential information, and all data is anonymized and can only be analyzed in aggregate. The API can be accessed using [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], or [[cURL]].&lt;ref name=developers&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bpd.lbl.gov/developers/|title = developers (Buildings Performance Database)|publisher = [[Berkeley Lab]]|accessdate = June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dale earned large sums from working for the [[New York Stock Exchange]], allowing him to collect 19th and 20th-century French paintings. Although he considered establishing a private museum, he donated a part of his collection to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1941.  The rest of his collection was bequeathed to the National Gallery upon his death.&lt;ref name=NBK&gt;{{cite-NBK|Chester Dale}}, page 373; and National Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C.), pages 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Dale was born in 1883, and started his financial career at the age of fifteen, as a [[running|runner]] for the [[New York Stock Exchange]].

In time, he acquired assets that included utilities, railroads, and municipal bonds in the USA and Canada.  When the National Gallery of Art opened, Dale lent the gallery 22 American pictures, and within a few months, two rooms of French [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] paintings were established.  Upon the request of painter [[George Bellows]], Dale agreed to sit for an oil on canvas painting in 1922, depicting Dale holding a golf club.  Both Dale and Bellows were semi-professional athletes in their younger years.&lt;ref name="NGA-tour" /&gt;

In 1962, the long term loans of major artists who worked in [[Paris]] from the mid-19th century through the mid-20th century were left to the gallery at the bequest of Dale.  Included in the works that Dale bequeathed to the gallery were works by [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]], [[Claude Monet]],  [[Paul Cézanne]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Portrait of Louis Guillaume]]'' (1882)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pablo Picasso]].

At the age of 27, he married Maud Murray, a painter and critic, who introduced him to the idea of collecting modern art.

===Legacy===
The National Gallery of Art obtained 88 paintings from Dale's personal residence, an apartment in the [[Plaza Hotel]] in New York, upon his death.  The paintings were added to his 152 items already on loan to the National Gallery of Art.  There were 6 new galleries established on the main floor to house the additional acquisitions.  The bequest included 240 paintings, 7 sculptures, 22 graphics, over 1200 sales catalogs, and more than 1500 books.  Additionally as part of the bequest, there were 3 fellowships established with a $500,000 endowment. &lt;ref name="NGA-Bequest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/past/data/exh261.shtm|title=The Chester Dale Bequest|year=1965|publisher=National Gallery of Art|accessdate=2009-07-19}}{{dl|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Matthew Paris Elephant from Parker MS 16 fol 151v.jpg|thumb|300px|Elephant from ''Chronica maiora'', Part II, [[Parker Library]], MS 16, fol. 151v]]
The '''''Chronica Majora''''' is an important medieval [[illuminated manuscript]] [[chronicle]] written in Latin by [[Matthew Paris]], a [[Benedictine monk]] living in the [[St Alban's Cathedral|Abbey of St Albans]].  The work begins with the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation of the world]] and contains annals up to 1259, the year of Paris's death.

The content up to 1234 or 1235 is primarily based on ''[[Flores Historiarum]]'' by [[Roger of Wendover]] (d. 1236), with additions; after that date the material is Paris's own, written in his own hand from the entry for 1213 onward.

The first two parts of the ''Chronica'', covering the years up to 1188 and from 1189 to 1253, are contained in two manuscripts in the [[Parker Library, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], Parker MS 26 and MS 16.&lt;ref&gt;Parker Library on the web: [https://parker.stanford.edu/parker/catalog/rf352tc5448 MS 26], [https://parker.stanford.edu/parker/catalog/rb378fk5493 MS 16I], [https://parker.stanford.edu/parker/catalog/qt808nj0703 MS 16II] 362 x 244/248 mm. ff 141 + 281&lt;/ref&gt; They include 100 marginal drawings, some fragmentary maps and an itinerary, and full-page drawings of [[William I of England|William I]], and the Elephant with Keeper. MS 16 has very recently had all prefatory matter re-bound separately.

The remainder of the ''Chronica'', from 1254 until Paris's death in 1259, is in the [[British Library]], bound as Royal MS 14 C VII folios 157-218, following Paris's ''Historia Anglorum'' (an abridgement of the ''Chronica'' covering the period from 1070 to 1253).&lt;ref&gt;British Library Digitised Manuscript: [http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Royal_MS_14_C_VII Royal MS 14 C VII]&lt;/ref&gt;

An unillustrated copy of the material from 1189 to 1250, with much of his sharper commentary about Henry III toned down or removed, was supervised by Paris himself and now exists as British Library Cotton MS Nero D V, fol. 162-393.&lt;ref&gt;British Library Archives and Manuscripts catalogue: [http://searcharchives.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?docId=IAMS040-001102726 Cotton MS Nero D V].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Chronicles of Jerahmeel''''' is a voluminous work that draws largely on [[Pseudo-Philo]]'s earlier history of Biblical events and is of special interest because it includes [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] versions of certain [[deuterocanonical]] books in the [[Septuagint]]. 

The ''Chronicles'' were published in English as ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GwPVMv0NxMQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Chronicles+of+Jerahmeel%22#PPR7,M1 The Chronicles of Jerahmeel Or, the Hebrew Bible Historiale]'' by the [[Royal Asiatic Society]], translated by [[Moses Gaster]], 1899. Gaster stated in his extensive preface his view (p. xx) that the ''Chronicles'' were compiled from several Hebrew sources, some quite ancient and others more recent. 

The actual compiler of the chronicles identifies himself as "Eleasar ben Asher the Levite' who, according to Gaster, lived in the [[Rhineland]] in the 14th century.  The most recent events depicted in the ''Chronicles'' refer to the time of the [[Crusades]], but the entire rest of it pertains to the period before AD 70. Among the early sources quoted in the work is the 1st century Rabbi [[Eliezer ben Hyrcanus]].

Gaster explained that he chose to title it "Chronicles of Jerahmeel" instead of "Chronicles of Eleasar" because of his analysis that Eleasar was merely a compiler, while the enigmatic "Jeraḥmeel" is the source most extensively reproduced, following the ''[[Yosippon]]'' which is otherwise extant. This 'Jerahmeel' has since been identified as Jerahmeel ben Solomon, thought to have flourished in Italy around 1150. After a thorough discussion of all the textual evidence, Gaster further concluded that, like the closely related ''[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]]'', it relies on sources ultimately dependent on [[Isidore of Seville]], particularly evident in its mention of "[[Franks]]" and "[[Lombards]]" among the [[Sons of Noah]].

'''Conservation and restoration of objects made from plastics'''  is an activity dedicated to the [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] of objects of historical and personal value made from [[plastics]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]]. Within museum collections there are a variety of artworks and artifacts that are composed of [[plastic]] material whether they are [[Synthetic plastic|synthetic]] or semi-synthetic; these were created for a range of uses from artistic, to technical, to domestic use. Plastics have become an integral component of life and many plastic objects have become staple icons or objects worth preserving for the future.  Although relatively new material for museum collections, plastics having originated in the 19th century, they are deteriorating at an alarming rate, risking the loss not only of the objects themselves, but through their deterioration processes they place objects within their vicinity at risk too.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Plastics are made of synthetic, semi-synthetic and organic material, all of which are susceptible to degradation, with their respective off-gassing being harmful to the objects nearby in museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|pmc=2874019|title=Our Plastic Age|last=Thompson|first=Richard|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent changes in plastic manufacturing, as a result of environmental concerns, towards [[biodegradable plastics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://response.restoration.noaa.gov/about/media/what-you-can-do-keep-plastic-out-ocean.html|title=What You Can Do to Keep Plastic out of the Ocean {{!}} response.restoration.noaa.gov|website=response.restoration.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a potentially negative effect upon the long term stability of such objects within museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Madden|first=Odile|date=Spring 2014|title=Preserving Plastics: An Evolving Material, a Maturing Profession spring 2014. Conservation of plastics|url=https://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/pdf/v29n1.pdf|journal=Conservation Perspectives the GCI Newsletter|volume=|pages=4–9|via=The Getty Conservation Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification and composition of plastics  ==
All plastics vary by the type of polymer used to create it, these polymers are what conservators look to in order to divide plastics into groupings that could best help create a preservation or restoration plan. Groupings are important as some plastics can be dangerous or even flammable thus it is key to identify these plastics in order to best understand how to store and care for them.

== Identifying plastics ==
Identification of plastic in a collection is extremely important because all plastics release a harmful toxin or gas that can damage nearby objects and by being able to identity the most harmful plastics a preservation plan can be set into place to slow down the effects and protect other objects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Plastics are identified in three ways including looking for its trade name, trademark or patent number. Identifying plastic is done in order to  check what the plastic is composed of as different makers and depending on the year are different material could have been used to make the plastic.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2010|title=Care and Identification of Objects Made from Plastic|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/08-04.pdf|journal=Conserve O Gram|volume=|pages=|via=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is no marker to identify the type of plastic used then it can be identified by using various types of data analyzed using [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] technology like, [[Optical spectrometer|Optical Spectroscopy]], [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]] and [[Near-infrared spectroscopy|near-infared spectroscopy]] along with [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Other forms of identification include [[elemental analysis]], thermal analysis to decipher the composition of plastics.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Once the composition is found it is best to determine if the plastic in the collection will be considered Malignant or not.

[http://www.modip.ac.uk/ MoDiP], the Museum of Design in plastics,  has created a guide to plastic objects that includes the objects  manufacturing date,  manufacturing process along with its typical characteristics such as feel and smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modip.ac.uk/resources/curators_guide/A-Z_plastics|title=A - Z of plastics materials {{!}} Museum of Design in Plastics, MoDiP|website=www.modip.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important because if an object in the collection that is listed here differs from smell or touch then it could be the object has begun to deteriorate. It is also encouraged that if one has an object not listed then they should contact MoDiP to include it to the list.

== Common plastics ==
These are plastics that are still capable of degradation but its effects are not as harmful to nearby objects.The list below is of chemical compositions that make up common plastics found in museum collections:
* Cellulose Esters&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/29_1/preserving.html|title=Preserving Plastics: An Evolving Material a Maturing Profession (Feature)|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plasticized PVC,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ([[Polyvinyl chloride|Polyvinyl Chloride]], PVC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.creativemechanisms.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-pvc-plastic|title=Everything You Need To Know About PVC Plastic|last=Staff|first=Creative Mechanisms|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are plastics that will age faster if left untreated and have a higher potential or off-gassing or release a toxin that can damage surrounding objects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; To determine if objects are considered malignant proper identification of the object will be necessary.  
* [[Polyvinyl chloride|Poly(Vinyl Chloride)]]
* [[Cellulose nitrate|Cellulose Nitrate]]
* [[Cellulose acetate|Cellulose Acetate]]
* [[Vulcanization|Vulcanized Rubber]] 
* [[Bioplastic|Biodegradable plastics]]

[[Bioplastic|Biodegradable plastics]] have become an issue because as plastic is used in many everyday objects the push to create biodegradable plastics has been on the rise. This causes an issue for conservators because these object will ultimately degrade as their composition is designed to as there is an increase in plastic waste.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is these biodegradable plastics that can be prove to be difficult and museums will need to provide research for these items quickly to slow done their deterioration.

== Deterioration ==
Perhaps the most difficult part about plastic deterioration is that one cannot visibly see what types of chemical reactions are occurring inside the polymer or even identity the type of plastic until it is too late. Typically all plastics will give off a distinct odor, leak toxins, or will begin to shrink or crack in some way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/network/identification-of-plastics-by-looking-touching-and-smelling|title=Identification of plastics by looking, touching and smelling|work=Blog|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although deterioration will inevitably happen it is important to know  the causes of it and be able to mitigate it.

=== Causes of deterioration  ===
The cause of deterioration regarding plastics can be linked to age, chemical composition, storage, and improper handling of the objects. Conservators are in place to slow down the processes of deterioration by considering the 4 leading caused of deterioration:

# '''Age'''-  when plastics were first manufactured in the 19th century they were composed of semi-organic material, thus these over the years these objects have deteriorated due to lack of research and improper handling of these plastics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Without enough time to care for objects the older objects have deteriorated. 
# '''Chemical''' - Depending on the objects' chemical composition, conservators can understand how it will react overtime. Other chemical reactions come from heat, oxygen, light, liquids, additives and biological attacks as these can cause a reaction in the polymer to speed up deterioration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Chemical reactions are also caused by objects coming into contact with water and oxygen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
# '''Storage-'''  When objects are improperly stored is when contamination and deterioration can occur. This often occurs when temperature or relative humidity fluctuate in the storage area as this causes the polymers to react to the environment and will begin to deteriorate and possible contaminate surrounding objects. Storage should also be thought of as when an object is on exhibit as this is when the object is on display with lights and its temperature and humidity can fluctuate, being able to create a plan to adjust the exhibit case while on display can help prevent any damage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# '''Improper handling''' - This is due in part to improper cleaning techniques when using water or solvents on material that do not support those cleaning methods.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Also when handling the objects human error can occur that can cause abrasions or scratches.

=== Types of deterioration  ===
Understanding the different types of plastic chemical degradation as this helps determine what not to expose plastics to  As the polymers that are composed of the plastics can deteriorate easily by changes in temperature, water or light it is important to understand how these affect the polymers. Listed below are the chemical reactions that occur with the deterioration of the polymer's structure.

* '''Photo-oxidative degradation''' refers to plastic object degrading by being exposed to UV and Visible Light although the type of wavelength that will damage the plastic depends on the composition of the polymer.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Balijit|date=2007|title=Mechanistic Implications of Plastic Degradation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391007003539|journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability|volume=93|pages=561–584|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt; In General however, plastic will be affected by light and it is best practice to keep plastic away from light sources as much as possible. 
* '''[[Thermal degradation of polymers|Thermal degradation]]''' affects the whole unit of the polymer that the object is composed of and is affected by the temperature and amount of light the object is exposed to.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 
* '''Ozone-Induced degradation''' will deteriorate saturated and  unsaturated polymers when the polymer is exposed to "ozone in the air" will speed the process of deterioration.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A test is conducted to see if the objects has been exposed by taking small samples and analyzed using an [[FTIR]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* '''[[Catalysis|Catalytic Degradation]]''' Mainly focuses on plastic waste polymers as they are transformed into hydrocarbons
* '''[[Biodegradation]]''' is when the surface or the strength of the plastic changes, these properties allow it to decompose or mineralize by carbon dioxide and water.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* '''Decomposition of Hydroperoxides''' is when metal and metal ions are found on the plastic material as this can also lead to the deterioration of the object&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2012|title=Physical and Chemical processes leading to deterioration  of original properties of plastic|url=http://popart-highlights.mnhn.fr/wp-content/uploads/4_Degradation/2_Physical_and_chemical_processes/4_2_PhysicalAndChemicalProcessesLeadingToDeterioration.pdf|journal=Processes Leading to the Deterioration of Plastics|volume=|pages=|via=POPART}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}Additional effects of deterioration

For plastics composed of [[Cellulose acetate|Cellulose Acetate]] the  most common sign of  deterioration condition is when it this type is exposed to water, it will give off a smell of vinegar ([[Vinegar syndrome]]),  its surface will have  a white powder residue  and it will begin to shrink.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Cellulose Acetate butyrate and Cellulose butyrate will produce [[butyric acid]] which has a "vomit odor".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

[[Polyvinyl chloride|Poly(Vinyl Chloride]]) will most likely cause a blooming effect, white spores, on the surface that if it comes into contact with other surrounding material it will contaminate it.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Preventative care  ==
=== Handling ===
Safety gloves such as those made of Nitrile can help prevent toxins entering the skin when handling plastic objects.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As plastics can ooze or off-gas material that may or may not be visible to the naked eye wearing gloves other than cotton is recommended.

=== Storage environment ===
Proper storage of plastics can help slow down the degrading process of plastics. Plastics are currently stored with a RH Level of 50% with the storage temperature at 18 degrees Celsius with no light coming into contact with the objects.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shashoua|first=Yvonne|date=2014|title=A Safe Space Storage Strategies for Plastics|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/29_1/storage.html|journal=Conservation Perspectives|volume=29|pages=|via=http://getty.edu/conservation/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the composition of each plastic material can be different it is difficult to determine one unifying storage care plan ,thus  understanding the composition of the plastic can help determine their preferred climate levels.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Keeping plastics at a stable low temperature or considering placing these objects either in cold storage or in oxygen impermeable bags helps slow degradation.

Monitoring plastics in their storage environment is done by keeping track of their status and condition by using log entries on Excel spreadsheets or another format. To monitoring their temperature environment this is done using data loggers which track hourly changes in temperature. These methods can help strengthen a plan of preventative care as monitoring their status along with temperature can help connect any changes that occur.

=== Long-term storage equipment ===
Adsorbents such as "activated carbon, silica gel and zeolites"  are used as they can help with the gasses that are released from plastics as this material can help slow down the degrading process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These absorbents can also be used when the object is on display to prevent and off-gassing that could occur, so these can be used on exhibit and long-term storage. Absorbents along with acid-free boxes and silica gel can help slow down the process of degradation and [[Cellulose acetate film|vinegar syndrome]] which is common in film, Lego and artwork. A yearly check up of plastic objects can help monitor the condition of plastic objects as well as the condition of the surrounding objects to ensure they have not been contaminated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Objects composed of Cellulose Nitrate  benefit from cold storage as they are sensitive to increases in temperature.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''[http://www.gaylord.com/Preservation/Conservation-Supplies/Wrapping%2C-Lining-%26-Support-Materials/Marvelseal%26%23174%3B-360-Barrier-Film-%2850-ft-%29/p/M3650 Oxygen Impermeable bags]''' are used as they absorb all the oxygen in the bag.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With no oxygen to trigger the event of deterioration that is used for some plastics the process may be slowed down.

== Conservation   ==
The process of conservation and restoration of plastics requires an understanding of composition of the plastic and an appreciation for the possible methods of restoring plastics and their limitations, as well as an appreciation for the post-treatment preventive care of the object.

=== Cleaning ===
The process of cleaning plastics is done through the use of solvents or using modern technology after identifying the polymers that make up the composition of the plastic. Cleaning can still be done using water or solvents however,  solvents run the risk of physically damaging the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://popart-highlights.mnhn.fr/wp-content/uploads/5_Active_conservation/1_Conservation_of_plastics_in_collections/5_1_Introduction.pdf|title=Studies in Active Conservation of Plastic Artefacts in Museums|last=Shashoua|first=Yvonne|publisher=POPART|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spot test can be performed if uncertain how the object will react to water or solvents.

Light cleaning on the object is possible, but if cleaning requires a heavy hand then the use of  an Erbium: YAG Laser could assist in cleaning tougher scratches or abrasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/eryag-laser|title=Er:YAG laser - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Scratch removal ===
Within the field of contemporary art, where the finish is part of the artists intent the removal of scratches plays a far greater role than it would with social-historical artifacts, as such conservators have undertaken, and scientifically investigated, a variety of methods of scratch removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laganà|first=Ana|date=2014|title=Looking through Plastics: Investigating options for the treatment of scratches, abrasions, and losses in cast unsaturated polyester works of art|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/cons_plastics/related_mats.html|journal=COM-CC 17th Triennial Conference Preprints,|volume=|pages=|via=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/art_LA/paper_2014_icom_cc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filling ===
Fillings are used if the object has suffered considerable damage. The process of filling depends on the objects chemical composition consisting  of- refractive indexes, transparency, low viscosity, and its compatibility with the rest of the object.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/conservation-journal/the-use-of-lasers-in-the-conservation-of-museum-objects-made-from-plastics|title=The use of lasers in the conservation of museum objects made from plastics|work=Blog|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Balkan|Balkans]] [[folklore]], a '''dhampir''' (sometimes spelled ''dhampyre'', ''dhamphir'', or ''dhampyr'') is a creature that is the result of a union between a [[vampire]] and a [[human]]. This union was usually between male vampires and female humans, with stories of female vampires mating with male humans being rare.&lt;ref&gt;"Vampires Through the Ages: Lore &amp; Legends of the World's Most Notorious Blood Drinkers" "These vampires then, usually male, but in some rare stories female as well, traveled to another village where they were unknown to the inhabitants and married, producing offspring."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2018}}
The word ''dhampir'' derives from the words ''dham'', albanian Gheg variant of dhëmb (“tooth”) + pir, participle of pi (“to drink”), literally meaning 'that who drinks through his/her teeth'. It is also thought that word for vampire descends from Slavic "упирь" or "[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/%C7%ABpyr%D1%8C|ǫpyrь]]".&lt;ref&gt;''From Demons to Dracula: The Creation of the Modern Vampire Myth'' by Matthew Beresford, {{ISBN|1861894031}}, 2008, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Deutsches Wörterbuch von Jacob Grimm und Wilhelm Grimm''. 16 Bde. (in 32 Teilbänden). Leipzig: S. Hirzel 1854–1960.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Vampire". ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word ''dhampir'' may also have arisen from [[folk etymology]] due to the resemblance between the words ''vampir'' and ''dhampir''.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Nomenclature==
The word "dhampir" is associated with Balkan folklore, as described by [[Tatomir Vukanović|T. P. Vukanović]]. In the rest of the region, terms such as [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''vampirović'', ''vampijerović'', ''vampirić'' (thus, [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] ''lampijerović'', etc.) literally meaning "vampire's son", are used.&lt;ref name=levk&gt;Levkievskaja, E.E. La mythologie slave : problèmes de répartition dialectale (une étude de cas : le vampire). Cahiers slaves n°1 (septembre 1997). [http://www.recherches-slaves.paris4.sorbonne.fr/Cahier1/Levkievskaja.htm Online (French).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112192340/http://www.recherches-slaves.paris4.sorbonne.fr/Cahier1/Levkievskaja.htm |date=2008-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=petr&gt;Петровић, Сретен. 2000. Основи демонологије. In: Систем српске митологије. Просвета, Ниш 2000. [http://svevlad.org.rs/knjige_files/petrovic_mitologija.html#vampir Online (Serbian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331041243/http://www.svevlad.org.rs/knjige_files/petrovic_mitologija.html |date=2009-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other regions the child is named "Vampir" if a boy and "Vampirica" if a girl, or "Dhampir" if a boy and "Dhampirica" if a girl. In Bulgarian folklore, numerous terms such as ''glog'' (lit. "[[Common Hawthorn|hawthorn]]"), ''vampirdzhiya'' ("vampire" + ''[[nomen agentis]]'' [[suffix]]), ''vampirar'' ("vampire" + ''nomen agentis'' suffix), ''dzhadadzhiya'' and ''svetocher'' are used to refer to vampire children and descendants, as well as to other specialized [[vampire hunter]]s.&lt;ref name=dimitr&gt;Димитрова, Иваничка. 1983. Българска народна митология. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071024035846/http://bgrod.org/Vjara/index.php?p=bogove&amp;page=vampir Online article (Bulgarian)]&lt;/ref&gt; Dhampiraj is also an Albanian surname.

==Origin==
In the Balkans it was believed that male vampires have a great desire for women, so a [[vampire]] will return to have intercourse with his wife or with a woman he was attracted to in life.&lt;ref name=levk /&gt; Indeed, in one recorded case, a Serbian widow tried to blame her pregnancy on her late husband, who had supposedly become a vampire,&lt;ref name="petr"/&gt; and there were cases of Serbian men pretending to be vampires in order to reach the women they desired.&lt;ref&gt;Laković, Aleksandar. 2001. Vampiri kolo vode. In: [[Glas javnosti]], 20-12-2001. [http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2001/12/20/srpski/F01121902.shtml Online (Serbian)]&lt;/ref&gt; In Bulgarian folklore, vampires were sometimes said to [[Defloration|deflower]] virgins as well.&lt;ref name="levk"/&gt; The sexual activity of the vampire seems to be a peculiarity of [[South Slav]]ic vampire belief as opposed to other Slavs,&lt;ref name="levk"/&gt; although a similar motif also occurs in [[Belarus]]ian legends.&lt;ref&gt;Міфы Бацькаўшчыны. Вупыр (Вупар). [http://slounik.org/82139.html Online (Belarusian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers==

Legends state that Dhampirs were normal members of the community. But male Dhampirs of paternal vampire descent could see invisible vampires and practice sorcery, often starting careers as vampire hunters, which would be practiced for generations from father to son.&lt;ref&gt;The Vampire Book: The Encyclopedia of the Undead&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tatomir Vukanović|T. P. Vukanović]]. 1957-1959. "The Vampire." ''Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society'', 3rd ser. Part 1: 36(3-4): 125-133; Part 2: 37(1-2): 21-31; Part 3: 37(3-4): 111-118; Part 4: 39(1-2): 44-55. Reprinted in ''Vampires of the Slavs'', ed. Jan Perkowski (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Slavica, 1976), 201-234. The reprint lacks footnotes. Most material on dhampirs is in part 4, under the heading "Dhampir as the Chief Magician for the Destruction of Vampires."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Vampires of the Slavs'' by Jan Louis Perkowski "The practice of sorcery for the destruction of vampires is carried on in the house of Dhampir's descendants from father to son, throughout the generations."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Some traditions specify signs by which the children of a vampire can be recognized. [[Albania]]n legends state they have untamed dark or black hair and lack a shadow.&lt;ref name="petr"/&gt; In [[Bulgaria]]n folklore, possible indications include being "very dirty", having a soft body, no nails and bones (the latter physical peculiarity is also ascribed to the vampire itself), and "a deep mark on the back, like a tail." In contrast, a pronounced nose was often a sign, as were larger than normal ears, teeth or eyes. According to J. Gordon Melton, from his book, ''The Vampire Book: The Encyclopedia of the Undead'', in some areas, a true dhampir possessed a "slippery, jelly-like body and lived only a short life—a belief ... that vampires have no bones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QNlCwAAQBAJ&amp;q=slippery,+jelly-like+body+and+lived+only+a+short+life#v=snippet&amp;q=slippery,+jelly-like+body+and+lived+only+a+short+life&amp;f=false|title=The Vampire Book: The Encyclopedia of the Undead|year=2010|publisher=Visible Ink Press|page=201|author=J.

'''Discrimination in Ghana''' refers to all forms and manifestations of actions that deny social participation or human rights to certain categories of people in Ghanaian society or institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=discrimination, definition|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/american-english/discrimination |work=Cambridge Dictionaries Online|publisher=Cambridge University|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not always the case, discrimination in Ghana is often based on preconceived, usually unfavorable, judgments toward people or a person because of their religion, tribe, language or  personal characteristics including but not limited to gender, political opinion, social class, age, disability and sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="christian council"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.citifmonline.com/2015/02/22/discrimination-of-muslim-students-christian-council-calls-for-consensus/ | title=Discrimination of Muslim students: Christian Council calls for consensus | date=22 February 2015 | agency=CitiFmOnline | accessdate=March 1, 2015 | author=Allotey Akweiteh, Godwin | location=Koforidua - Ghana}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="koforidua"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2015/February-20th/govt-condemns-discrimination-against-muslim-pupils-threatens-to-sanction-school-heads.php | title=Gov't condemns discrimination against Muslim pupils; threatens to sanction school heads | date=20 February 2015 | agency=MyJoyOnline | accessdate=March 1, 2015 | author=Gadugah, Nathan | location=Accra Ghana}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="star fm"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=347477 | title=Peace Council moves to resolve "discrimination" against Muslim students | work=StarFmOnline | date=20 February 2015 | agency=GhanaWeb | accessdate=March 1, 2015 | location=Accra - Ghana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Ghana placed below average on the [[Failed state index]] scoring 4.9/10.0 when measured against the variables of ''Tolerance and Inclusion'', and ''Discrimination and violence against minorities''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/data/spi/components/com11#performance/countries/idr48/idr48%3C/ref%3E | title=Tolerance and Inclusion | publisher=Social Progress Index | accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of discrimination in Ghana==

===Age===

===Disability===
{{Main|Disability in Ghana}}

Discrimination in Ghana is widespread against the disabled. Few educational institutions accept disabled students or make provision for such students including those with mild cases, for example students who cannot climb stairs. Government building and worship centers are mostly built also lacking that same capability.&lt;ref name="quest.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.quest.com.gh/give-the-disabled-equal-access/ | title=Give the Disabled Equal Access | work=Quest.com | date=November 2011 | agency=HRAC/Ghana | accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ghanaweb"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Building-Barrier-Free-Environment-For-The-Disabled-203500 | title=Building Barrier-Free Environment For The Disabled | work=Ghanaweb.com | date=20 February 2011 | accessdate=July 29, 2015 | author=Addi, Seth K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults with mental illness may be put in [[prayer camps]]. In some communities infants who show signs of deformity are put to death for fear of infecting everyone else in their family with a perceived bad luck.&lt;ref name="graphic online"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/8463-7-communities-abolish-practice-of-killing-infants-with-deformities.html | title=7 Communities abolish practice of killing infants with deformities | work=Graphic.com | date=29 April 2013 | accessdate=July 29, 2015 | author=Enock Darfah Frimpong, Benjamin Xornam Glover | location=Upper East Region}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="myjoyonline"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://edition.myjoyonline.com/pages/news/201301/99854.php | title=Spirit Children; An undercover investigation by Anas Aremeyaw Anas | work=myjoyonline | date=14 January 2013 | accessdate=July 29, 2015| author=Anas Aremeyaw Anas| location=Sirigu, Bikum and southern Burkina Faso}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ghananewsagency"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ghananewsagency.org/features/deformed-children-are-being-killed-in-ghana-34633 | title=Deformed Children Are Being Killed In Ghana | work=Ghana News Agency | date=14 October 2011 | accessdate=July 29, 2015 | author=Albert Oppong Ansah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education institutions===
The [[Lord's Prayer]] is compulsory to students in all basic schools and in most senior high schools in the country. Besides the Lord's Prayer, Morning devotion, the widely practiced Christian ritual of praying before class starts in the morning is now been contested by Muslim parents and students.&lt;ref name="modernghana"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/601952/1/morning-devotion-in-schoolslet-us-l.html | title=Morning Devotion In Schools—Let Us Learn From The Nigerians | date=2 March 2015 | accessdate=July 29, 2015 | author=Opanin Kwabena Mensah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment and workplace===
Muslim women are banned from wearing a headscarf to work not only in private spaces but also in government offices. In March 2015, nurses at Mamobi Polyclinic in [[Accra]] were asked to go home and not return as punishment for putting on some form of head covering.&lt;ref name="mamobi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ghanacrusader.com/hijab-wearing-nurse-dismissed-work/ | title=Hijab wearing nurse ‘dismissed’ from work | work=Ghanacrusader.com | date=March 4, 2015 | accessdate=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 5 of the [[Constitution of Ghana]] protects freedom and practice of religion.&lt;ref name="constitution."&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/republic/constitution.php?id=Gconst5.html | title=FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS | publisher=Ghanaweb | work=Constitution of the Republic of Ghana | accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013 Report on [[International Religious Freedom]] published by the [[United States Department of State]] concludes that [[Government of Ghana]] generally respects all religious groups and has shown commitment to this by demonstrating leadership style when skirmishes do arise. It however confirmed among other cases accounts of instructors at some public schools openly discriminating against students based on their Islamic faith.&lt;ref name="USA"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/53d9077314.html | title=2013 Report on International Religious Freedom - Ghana | publisher=United States Department of State | date=28 July 2014 | accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following statements made by [[Bishop]] [[Charles Agyin-Asare]] at a [[Sunrise service]] in 2015  that there was "a [[religious cleansing]] campaign aimed at exterminating all Christians from the face of the earth and that "the world's [[Muslim population growth|1.2 billion Muslim population]] were targeting Christians to harm them for being Christians", various calls have been made by the government and stakeholders for religious leaders to moderate their speech and avoid cultivating fertile ground that can yield tension between the two faiths in Ghana. Agyen Asare at the service stated that "We won't keep quiet anymore, some people believe that they should kill others so that they are the only people who can worship their 'whoever'". He further stated that "It's unfortunate; and we are going to do something about it".&lt;ref name="modern ghana"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.modernghana.com/newsthread1/609378/1/292273#showcomments2 | title=Islamic fundamentalists can’t stop us from being Christians - Agyin-Asare | work=StarrFMOnline | date=6 April 2015 | agency=ModernGhana | accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agyin Asare"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailyguideghana.com/islamic-fundamentalists-cant-stop-us-from-being-christians-agyin-asare/ | title=Islamic fundamentalists can’t stop us from being Christians – Agyin-Asare | work=Dailyguideghana | date=April 5, 2015 | agency=starrfmonline | accessdate=April 6, 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629144129/http://www.dailyguideghana.com/islamic-fundamentalists-cant-stop-us-from-being-christians-agyin-asare/ | archivedate=June 29, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chief Imam of Ghana|Chief Imam]] has consistently dismissed claims of an existing Muslim-Christian tensions in the country stating that "we are living in harmony and would continue to do so".

Racism in Israel refers to all forms and manifestations of racism experienced in Israel, irrespective of the colour or creed of the perpetrator and victim, or their citizenship, residency, or visitor status.

In Turkey racism and ethnic discrimination are prevalent in its society and throughout its history, and this racism and ethnic discrimination is also institutional against the non-Muslim and non-Sunni minorities.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] This appears mainly in the form of negative attitudes and actions by Turks towards people who are not considered ethnically Turkish. Such discrimination is predominately towards non-Muslim minorities such as the Christian minorities like Greeks, Armenians, Assyrians, Bulgarians, Georgians, and others, as well as hostility towards various interpretations of Islam such as Alevis (Alawites), Sufis, Shiites and other Muslim non-Turks such as Kurds, Zazas and Arabs.

Ukraine is a multi-ethnic and multicultural nation[dubious – discuss][1][2][3] where racism and ethnic discrimination are arguably largely a fringe issue.[4] However, there have been recorded incidents of violence where the victim's race is widely thought to have played a role. Those incidents receive extensive media coverage and are usually condemned by all mainstream political forces.[5] Human Rights Watch reported that "Racism and xenophobia remain entrenched problems in Ukraine".[6] In 2012 the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) reported that "tolerance towards Jews, Russians and Romani appears to have significantly declined in Ukraine since 2000 and prejudices are also reflected in daily life against other groups, who experience problems in accessing goods and services".[7]

According to the 2007 Eurobarometer, Europeans believe that discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin is the most common form of discrimination in Europe.[1]

Racism of various forms is found in every country on Earth, albeit at different rates and nature of incidents.[2] Racism is widely condemned throughout the world, with 170 states signatories of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination by 8 August 2006.[3]--&gt;

'''''Fearless Girl''''' is a [[bronze sculpture]] by [[Kristen Visbal]], commissioned by [[State Street Global Advisors]] (SSgA) via McCann New York. It depicts a girl who, as originally installed, faced the ''[[Charging Bull]]'' (or ''[[Wall Street]] Bull'') statue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adage.com/article/agency-news/things-fearless-girl/308863/ |title=Eight Things You Don't Know About 'Fearless Girl' |publisher=[[Advertising Age]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was removed in November 2018 in preparation for relocation to in front of the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. A plaque with footprints was placed on the original site of ''Fearless Girl''.&lt;ref name="Moyer"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moyer |first=Liz |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/28/fearless-girl-on-the-move-but-leaves-footprints-for-visitors.html |title='Fearless Girl' on the move, but leaves footprints for visitors to stand in her place |work=[[CNBC]] |date=2018-11-28 |accessdate=2018-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

''Fearless Girl'' was commissioned to advertise for an [[index fund]] that comprises gender-diverse companies that have a relatively high percentage of women among their senior leadership. The plaque below the statue states: "Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference," with "SHE" being both a descriptive pronoun and the fund's [[NASDAQ]] [[ticker symbol]]. The statue was originally installed on March 7, 2017, at [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].

The commission by State Street Global Advisors specified that the statue should depict a girl with hands on her hips and chin up, with a height of 36 inches, which Kristen Visbal and her collaborators then increased to 50 inches, to better match the size of ''Charging Bull''.&lt;ref name="Dobnik" /&gt; Still, Visbal commented that "I made sure to keep her features soft; she's not defiant, she's brave, proud, and strong, not belligerent".&lt;ref name="Dobnik" /&gt; She modeled the sculpture on two children, but many of the distinguishing features were removed so that it would be universally appealing. A child who would represent all children "so everyone could relate to the Fearless Girl."&lt;ref name="Dobnik" /&gt;

== History ==
The statue was installed on March 7, 2017—the day before [[International Women's Day]]—by [[State Street Global Advisors]], in a campaign developed by advertising agency [[McCann Erickson|McCann New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/nycs-fearless-girl-statue-corporate-giants-46026204 |title=Behind NYC's 'Fearless Girl' statue are 2 corporate giants |last=Dobnik |first=Verena |date=March 9, 2017 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312022256/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/nycs-fearless-girl-statue-corporate-giants-46026204 |archivedate=March 12, 2017 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SSgA was celebrating the first anniversary of its "Gender Diversity Index" fund that "invests in U.S. large-capitalization companies that rank among the highest in their sector in achieving gender diversity across senior leadership".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.spdrs.com/post/driving-gender-diversity-with-a-bold-new-statement |title=Driving Gender Diversity with a Bold New Statement |last=Mavro |first=Jill |date=March 7, 2017 |website=SPDR Blog|access-date=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept for the statue was developed by Senior Art Director Lizzie Wilson and Senior Copywriter Tali Gumbiner. Wilson and Gumbiner established both the idea for the statue as well as the overall look of the girl using countless moodboards and imagery, which Visbal referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.adweek.com/creativity/the-story-of-the-fearless-girl-from-the-women-at-mccann-who-made-her/ |title=The Story of ‘The Fearless Girl,’ From the Women at McCann Who Made Her |last=Nudd |first=Tim |date=March 10, 2017 |website=Adweek|access-date=May 4, 2017|archive-ur;=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fearless Girl'' was originally given a one-week [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] permit that was later extended to 30 days.&lt;ref name="revesz" /&gt; Later, it was announced that the statue would remain in place through February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Fearless Girl' statue will stay through early next year |url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/27/news/fearless-girl-statue-2018/ |accessdate=March 27, 2017 |publisher=CNN Money}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Silva |first1=Daniella |title='Fearless Girl' statue will face off Wall Street bull for another year |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fearless-girl-statue-will-face-wall-street-bull-another-year-n738991 |website=NBC News |accessdate=March 27, 2017 |language=en |date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those advocating for the statue to stay longer was U.S. Representative [[Carolyn Maloney]] of [[New York's 12th congressional district]], who stated, "This statue has touched hearts across the world with its symbolism of the resiliency of women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/fearless-girl-charging-bull-wall-street-new-york-boradway-2018-bronze-statue-stand-up-a7651471.html |title=The Fearless Girl statue will stay on Wall Street until 2018 |last=O'Connor |first=Roision |date=March 27, 2017 |work=The Independent|access-date=April 11, 2017 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York City Public Advocate]] [[Letitia James]] wrote a letter that supported keeping the statue, "Fearless Girl stands as a powerful beacon, showing women—young and old—that no dream is too big and no ceiling is too high".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/exclusive-letitia-james-fearless-girl-permanent-article-1.2996620 |title=EXCLUSIVE: Letitia James wants 'Fearless Girl' to be permanent |work=NY Daily News|access-date=April 12, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

=== Juxtaposition with ''Charging Bull'' ===
[[File:Fearless Girl (cropped).jpg|thumb|The juxtaposition of ''Fearless Girl'' and ''Charging Bull'' upset some observers, including sculptor Arturo Di Modica, who installed ''Charging Bull'' in 1989.]]
[[Arturo Di Modica]], who installed ''Charging Bull'' in 1989, asked that the statue of the girl be removed, arguing that the piece exploited his work for commercial purposes and altered the perception of the bull.&lt;ref name="Mettler"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mettler |first1=Katie |title=Charging Bull sculptor says Fearless Girl distorts his art, so he's fighting back |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-charging-bull-sculptor-fearless-girl-20170412-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune |date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called ''Fearless Girl'' "an advertising trick" that he wants relocated, citing its political messaging.&lt;ref name="Stack2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/nyregion/fearless-girl-statue-de-blasio.html?_r=0 |title=‘Fearless Girl’ Statue to Stay in Financial District (for Now) |date=March 27, 2017 |work=The New York Times |last1=Stack |first1=Liam |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dobnik"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/03/26/new-york-invite-fearless-girl-statue-stay-wall-street/99677644/ |title=Will New York invite the 'Fearless Girl' statue to stay on Wall Street? |date=March 26, 2017 |work=USA Today |language=en |last1=Dobnik |first1=Verena |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 12, 2017, Di Modica and his attorney, former [[New York Civil Liberties Union]] director [[Norman Siegel]], challenged city officials who let the ''Fearless Girl'' statue be installed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/12/charging-bull-new-york-fearless-girl-statue-copyright-claim |title='Charging Bull' sculptor says New York's 'Fearless Girl' statue violates his rights |date=April 11, 2017 |work=The Guardian|access-date=April 13, 2017 |publisher=Associated Press |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/nyregion/charging-bull-sculpture-wall-street-fearless-girl.html |title=Wounded by ‘Fearless Girl,’ Creator of ‘Charging Bull’ Wants Her to Move |last=Barron |first=James |date=April 12, 2017 |work=The New York Times|access-date=April 13, 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Di Modica said that the statue corrupted ''Charging Bull''{{'s}} artistic integrity by distorting the intent of his statue from "a symbol of prosperity and for strength" into a villain, and does so for SSgA's commercial gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/04/12/charging-bull-sculptor-says-fearless-girl-distorts-his-art-hes-fighting-back/ |title=‘Charging Bull’ sculptor says ‘Fearless Girl’ distorts his art.

Some women criticized the statue as "corporate feminism" that violated their own [[feminism|feminist]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperallergic.com/364474/the-sculpture-of-a-fearless-girl-on-wall-street-is-fake-corporate-feminism/ The Sculpture of a “Fearless Girl” on Wall Street Is Fake Corporate Feminism.

"Corporate feminism", she wrote, "operates with the singular goal of aiding and abetting a universe of mothers who tuck their daughters in at night whispering, 'Someday, honey, you can lead the [[emerging markets]] and [[sovereign debt]] team at [[Citigroup]], and then become a director at [[Yahoo!|Yahoo]].{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/nyregion/fearless-girl-statue-manhattan.html |title=The False Feminism of ‘Fearless Girl’ |last=Bellafante |first=Ginia |date=March 16, 2017 |work=The New York Times|access-date=April 13, 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christine Emba, an opinion writer for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', wrote that the statue "portrays the empowered woman as a child, reinforcing the idea of femaleness as cute and inoffensive—a child with potential, maybe, but not all the way there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Emba |first=Christine |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/fearless-girl-and-charging-bull-are-more-alike-than-youd-think/2017/04/14/d3d909de-2147-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html |title='Fearless Girl' and 'Charging Bull' are more alike than you'd think |date=April 14, 2017 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other controversies ===
[[Gothamist]] reported on March 20, 2017, that masked New York activists covered the statue in "[[Make America Great Again]]" apparel and a [[flag of the United States|US flag]].  They also placed pro-[[Donald Trump]] signs on it, including one reading "VETS B4 ILLEGALS" and another with a drawing of [[Pepe the Frog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://gothamist.com/2017/03/20/fearless_girl_statue_trumped.php#photo-1 |title=Men In MAGA Hats Transform 'Fearless Girl' Statue Into Trump Supporter |work=Gothamist|access-date=November 1, 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 2017, State Street, the company that funded ''Fearless Girl'', paid $5 million to settle a lawsuit from its female and minority employees who alleged the company violated equal pay rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/fearless-girl-settlement.html |title=Firm Behind ‘Fearless Girl’ Statue Underpaid Women, U.S. Says |work=The New York Times |date=October 6, 2017 |access-date=August 8, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gallery of Maps'''&lt;ref name="vaticanstate.va" /&gt; ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Galleria delle carte geografiche'') is a gallery located on the west side of the [[Cortile del Belvedere|Belvedere Courtyard]] in the [[Vatican Museums|Vatican]] containing a series of painted topographical maps of [[Italy]] based on drawings by friar and geographer [[Ignazio Danti]].&lt;ref name="vaticanstate.va"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/vaticanstate/en/monumenti/musei-vaticani/galleria-delle-carte-geografiche.paginate.1.html | |publisher=Vatican State |title=Gallery of Maps |accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery was commissioned in 1580 by [[Pope Gregory XIII]] as part of other artistic works commissioned by the [[Pope]] to decorate the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. It took Danti three years (1580–1583) to complete the 40 panels of the 120&amp;nbsp;m long gallery.

==Design==
[[File:0 Italie - Corse - Sardaigne - Galleria delle carte geografiche.JPG|thumb|right|Map of [[Italy]], [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] – The Gallery of Maps – [[Vatican Museums]].]]

The panels map the entirety of the Italian peninsula in large-scale [[fresco]]es, each depicting a region as well as a perspective view of its most prominent city.  It is said that these maps are approximately 80% accurate.

With the [[Apennines]] as a partition, one side depicts the regions surrounded by the [[Ligurian Sea|Ligurian]] and [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]s and the other depicts the regions surrounded by the [[Adriatic Sea]].

After the series of regional maps, there are two general geographical maps (at the end of the itinerary): 

- Ancient Italy (with the inscription “Commendatur Italia locorum salubritate, coeli temperie, soli ubertate”)

- Modern Italy (with the inscription “Italia artium studiorumque plena semper est habita”).

==Other decorations==
The decorations on the vaulted ceiling are the work of a group of [[Mannerist]] artists including [[Cesare Nebbia]] and [[Girolamo Muziano]].

'''The Girls of Canby Hall''' Series by '''Emily Chase''', published by Scholastic (1984–1989), is a collection of young adult novels, based around the lives of a group of students at a New England boarding School.

Emily Chase, the "official author" is not really one writer, are many authors who have alternated themselves to write books (one of most famous is the romantic author [[Julie Garwood]]).

==Plot summary==

The story began with three teen-age girls coming to Canby Hall, a prestigious boarding school in Greenleaf, Massachusetts. Canby Hall was named after Julia Canby, the daughter of a Boston businessman who had died of Scarlet Fever while abroad in Europe.  Shelley Hyde, from [[Iowa]]; Faith Thompson from [[Washington, D.C.]] and Dana Morrison from [[New York City]]. They were assigned to 407 Baker Hall. (The other two dorm halls were Addison and Charles houses) At first the three girls clashed due to their differences, (Dana and Faith, both being from the East Coast, bonded immediately and Shelley having a harder time of it due to her being from the Midwest) but their young and hip housemother, Alison Cavanaugh, helped them sort through their differences and they bonded and became best friends.  Their friendship was even more solidified when, during a trip to see Shelley's family and friends in Iowa, Faith had a terrible medical emergency, which scared everyone involved.

After Shelley, Dana and Faith graduated, three new girls (Andrea "Andy" Cord; Jane Barrett and October "Toby" Houston) moved into 407, and on occasion, the six girls would get together, mainly for their former housemother's wedding and her pregnancy.  Jane's family (the Barretts) had helped give the money to build the school's science hall named Barrett Hall.  After Alison's marriage and her move to Boston, a new housemother named Meredith Pembroke comes along, and at first, handed out demerits with reckless abandon because she was overreacting to her own wild adolescence. Andrea, Jane and Toby talked her through the rough time, and then Meredith (nicknamed, Merrie) became as nice and friendly as Alison had been.

The other main adult, aside from the housemothers, was the school's austere headmistress, Patrice Allardyce, who was known as P.A. behind her back.  Despite her austerity and her enforcement of the rules, Ms. Allardyce was also discovered to be a fair, compassionate and personable human being too.

'''''Godkiller''''' is a [[transmedia storytelling|transmedia]] series of graphic novels, illustrated films, and novels created by [[filmmaker]] [[Matt Pizzolo]] that tells the stories of human beings caught in the crossfire of warring fallen gods.

The core series is a trilogy of feature-length illustrated films beginning with ''Godkiller: Walk Among Us'', illustrated by Anna Muckcracker and featuring performances by [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Davey Havok]] (lead singer of [[AFI (band)|AFI]]), [[Danielle Harris]], [[Bill Moseley]], [[Lydia Lunch]], [[Nicki Clyne]], and [[Justin Pierre]] (lead singer of [[Motion City Soundtrack]]). The series is particularly notable for its use of experimental and innovative media formats, such as the ''illustrated film'' format Pizzolo developed with producer Brian Giberson that merges [[sequential art]] with [[Computer animation|3D CGI]], [[motion graphics]] and dramatic voice performances in the style of a [[radio play]].&lt;ref&gt;Thill, Scott. "[https://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/10/post-apocalyptic-godkiller/ Post-Apocalyptic Comic Godkiller Emerges as 'Illustrated Film']". Wired.'' October 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizzolo and Muckcracker are currently at work on the second part of the trilogy ''Godkiller: Tomorrow's Ashes.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore |first=Debi |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33833/godkiller-updates-free-screening-limited-edition-dvd |title=Godkiller Updates: Free Screening &amp; Limited Edition DVD |work=Dreadcentral.com |date=2009-10-02 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The October 2009 illustrated film DVD ''Godkiller: Walk Among Us - Episode 1'' quickly established itself as its distributor's all-time fastest-selling release.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Debi. [http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34652/halo-8-launches-h8la-apparel-line "Halo-8 Launches H8LA Apparel Line"]. ''Dread Central''. November 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the first issue of the ''Godkiller 2: Tomorrow's Ashes'' comic book series debuted as a digital series.&lt;ref&gt;The Beat.

Godkiller returned in 2014 as a monthly paper comic book series from [[Black Mask Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kit, Borys]] (October 17, 2014). [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/grant-morrisons-sinatoro-getting-comic-738841 "Grant Morrison's 'Sinatoro' Getting the Comic Book Treatment From Black Mask Studios"]. [[The Hollywood Reporter]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, it was reported that ''Godkiller'' would be rebooted as an animated feature film trilogy directed by Pizzolo.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yamato, Jen]] (November 6, 2014). [http://deadline.com/2014/11/godkiller-comic-animated-movie-trilogy-black-mask-studios-1201276075/ ‘Godkiller’ Post-Apocalyptic Comic Bound For New Animated Trilogy]. ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication/Production history==
[[File:Godkiller Walk Among Us ep 2 dvd.jpg|thumb|Godkiller: Walk Among Us shortform episode-2 DVD cover (2010)]]
Pizzolo said about the inspiration behind ''Godkiller'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I thought it would be fun to design a new mythology for fuck-ups and misfits. My goal with it is to present heroes that don't behave heroically because it's their job to maintain the status quo or because they're bored and want to rescue a princess, they act heroically because they're regular misfits who are trying to do the best they can for each other in an unjust, fucked-up world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fullecirclestuff.blogspot.com/2009/11/making-of-godkiller.html |title=Fulle Circle Podcast: #70. The Making of "Godkiller" |work=Fullecirclestuff.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Core series===
The ''Godkiller'' series was devised to be simultaneously produced as a series of graphic novels and films (both utilizing the same sequential art) with the ultimate goal being a trilogy of feature-length films. Pizzolo and Muckcracker began by serializing ''Godkiller: Walk Among Us'' into a 6-issue comic book series (debuting in 2008) and a 3-episode film series (debuting in 2009) before the completed ''Walk Among Us'' feature film opened theatrically in 2010.

The ''Walk Among Us'' film was slated for a unique release of limited edition, bi-monthly DVDs starting September 29, 2009, followed by a theatrical run of the full feature in January 2010 and a DVD/Blu-ray release in March 2010.

Due to overwhelming demand far beyond studio expectations, the first DVD's street date was delayed until October 6, 2009, so enough DVDs could be supplied to the stores, including [[Best Buy]],  [[Borders Books]], [[F.Y.E.]] and [[Suncoast Motion Picture Company|Suncoast]], among many more retailers.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Debi. "[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33538/godkiller-dvd-release-pushed-back-accommodate-demand Godkiller DVD Release Pushed Back To Accommodate Demand]". Dread Central.'' September 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizzolo and Muckcracker are currently working on the second part of the trilogy, ''Godkiller: Tomorrow's Ashes.'' The new series is slated to be released in mid-2011, followed soon after by the next wave of films. The complete ''Tomorrow's Ashes'' feature-length film is expected to premiere theatrically in 2011.

===Additional series===

====''Godkiller: Silent War''====
[[File:Godkiller Silent War audiobook.jpg|thumb|Godkiller: Silent War audiobook cover (2009)]]
Pizzolo is currently writing the serialized, ongoing pre-apocalyptic prequel ''Godkiller: Silent War,'' an [[urban fantasy]] novel series which debuted as episodic e-books &amp; audiobooks on the special features of the ''Godkiller: Walk Among Us'' DVDs in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Debi. [http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33210/godkiller-dvd-will-include-prequel-audiobooks "Godkiller DVD Will Include Prequel Audiobooks"]. ''Dread Central''. August 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizzolo explained the dramatic structure to ''Dread Central'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Godkiller'' is split into two periods ... there's the pre-nuke world of ''Silent War'' and there's the post-nuke world of the graphic novel and illustrated film ''Walk Among Us.'' So ''Silent War'' is only a prequel insofar as it happens beforehand, but its events drive the ''Walk Among Us'' story, and many of the same characters appear in both. I'm super excited that the two stories can roll out together in this integrated way--everything about this project is unorthodox and crazy, hopefully everyone will enjoy the ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore |first=Debi |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33210/godkiller-dvd-will-include-prequel-audiobooks |title=Godkiller DVD Will Include Prequel Audiobooks |work=Dread Central |date=2009-08-27 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The early chapters of ''Silent War'' (released in October 2009, January 2010, and March 2010) depicted chaotic, youth-driven protests on Wall Street and are now considered prescient of the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement that began in September 2011. The protest scenes were illustrated by Muckcracker in mid-2011 as flashbacks in the comic book ''Godkiller: Tomorrow's Ashes - Spiderland'' and bear an uncanny resemblance to Occupy imagery. Pizzolo talked to ''Bleeding Cool'' about how the images of violent street protest, including a lynching of the Wall Street [[Charging Bull]], were not widely considered predictive at the time of their initial release.&lt;ref&gt;Falcetti, Louie. [http://www.bleedingcool.com/2012/07/30/killing-god-with-matt-pizzolo/ "Killing God with Matt Pizzolo"]. ''Bleeding Cool''. July 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We start tying in the events of ''Silent War'' in ''Spiderland.'' ''Silent War'' was previously a serialized prequel novella included on the ''Walk Among Us'' DVDs as e-books and audiobooks. I wrote it back in 2009 and some of the core plot takes place among young radicals protesting on Wall Street. The pages in ''Spiderland'' look like they're directly lifted from Occupy Wall Street, but Anna actually illustrated those pages last summer before Occupy started. It's funny because when ''Silent War'' started coming out people were telling me they didn't believe there would be a populist youth movement targeting Wall Street, but now when ''Spiderland'' comes out everyone will be like oh yeah that's so obvious haha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2012/07/30/killing-god-with-matt-pizzolo/ |title=Killing God With Matt Pizzolo - Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movies and TV News and Rumors |work=Bleedingcool.com |date=2012-07-30 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====''The Long Knives''====
Pizzolo has indicated that his upcoming graphic novel series [[Matt Pizzolo#The Long Knives|''The Long Knives'']] takes place in a shared universe with ''Godkiller'' and deals with several key ''Godkiller'' characters during the breakdown of society that precedes ''Godkiller: Walk Among Us''. ''The Long Knives'' is a [[Giallo]]-style horror illustrated by newcomer Ana Ludeshka.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Debi. [http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/36828/halo-8-announces-new-comic-bookillustrated-film-the-long-knives "Halo-8 Announces New Comic Book/Illustrated Film The Long Knives"]. ''Dread Central''. April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludeshka told ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was very shocked when I first read the Long Knives script. And not only because of the blood and the gore. There's no mercy in this story. It burns like cold things burn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/comics/605]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522070152/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/comics/605 |date=May 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Joe is recruited by an armed cult of populist assassins, he is thrust into a secret world of international cabals, alien conspiracies, and the countdown to Armageddon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore |first=Debi |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33880/halo-8-unveils-new-godkiller-clip |title=Halo-8 Unveils New Godkiller Clip |work=Dreadcentral.com |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formats==

===Illustrated film format===
[[File:Godkiller Walk Among Us cover art.jpg|thumb|Godkiller: Walk Among Us feature-length illustrated film DVD cover (2010)]]
Pizzolo developed the concept of an ''illustrated film'' with his producing partner Brian Giberson, mixing elements of anime, radio drama, video games, and motion comics. Utilizing the original artwork from the comic book, the ''illustrated film'' adds motion animation, visual effects, elaborate sound design, music, and voice-acting performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17587]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010210947/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17587 |date=October 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] asked Pizzolo to explain the differences between motion comics and illustrated films:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In illustrated films, we drive the pace of the storytelling with the dramatic voice performances and the sound design, so that allows us to showcase the illustrations in a way where you can really take a moment to absorb the art in the same way you can when reading a comic book ... Motion comics are closer to a form of [[limited animation]] that uses comics as source material. Illustrated films are closer to the experimental cinema of [[Ralph Bakshi|Ralph Bakshi's]] work, [[Chris Marker|Chris Marker's]] [[La jetée]] or animation like [[Liquid Television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thill |first=Scott |url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/10/post-apocalyptic-godkiller/ |title=Post-Apocalyptic Comic Godkiller Emerges as 'Illustrated Film' &amp;#124; Underwire |work=Wired.com |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pizzolo gave ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' additional thoughts on differences between motion comics and illustrated films:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The simple answer is illustrated-films are an attempt to merge comic book sequential art with cinematic storytelling, whereas motion comics seem more intent on re-purposing comic books into cartoons. And I don't mean to sound like a dick because I think motion comics are cool, these are just different. On first glance, they look very similar ... and people might say '' 'it's moving comics on a screen, that's motion comics' '' to which I say '' 'just because [[Seinfeld]] is moving people captured on 35mm film doesn't make it the same thing as [[Full Metal Jacket]].' '' On one level you could see motion comics and illustrated films as siblings like comics books vs graphics novels or TV shows vs feature films, but there are deeper distinctions. Basically, we're filmmakers so we're bringing a cinematic sensibility to this... We animate motion in the frame, but the need for motion is different in film ... it's not like [[Michael Madsen]] bounces around the frame in [[Reservoir Dogs]] the way [[Wakko]] does in [[Animaniacs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/comics/589]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507220720/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/comics/589 |date=May 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Godkiller Walk Among Us limited edition cover.jpg|thumb|Godkiller: Walk Among Us limited edition episode-1 DVD cover by Tim Seeley (2009)]]Explaining the decision to develop the new filmmaking format, Pizzolo told ''Bloody Disgusting'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;When we decided to make an anime adaptation of the comic book, I couldn't see how a traditional animated approach would do justice to Anna's incredibly lush and detailed illustrations. It made perfect sense to adapt the medium to suit her art, rather than vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Miska, Brad. "[http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/15395 Cult Icons Topline Halo-8's 'Godkiller']". Bloody-Disgusting.'' February 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pizzolo clarified further in an interview with ''Horror News'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are lots of reasons [Godkiller was made as an illustrated film], but I think the most important one was really being inspired by Anna Muckcracker's gorgeous artwork. Brian Giberson (my partner at Halo-8) and I had been experimenting with the illustrated film format for a while, but we might still have gone with traditional animation for Godkiller since it's really risky to experiment with a crazy story and a new filmmaking format at the same time. But once I saw Anna's art I knew that no traditional form of animation could do justice to the grimy, textured, surreal aesthetic she created. It was really an artistic choice, because from a business point of view it's just so risky.&lt;ref&gt;Horror, Joy.

The '''Greek Film Archive''' ({{lang-el|Ταινιοθήκη της Ελλάδος}}, ''Tainiothiki Tis Ellados'') is a nonprofit [[film archive]] organization located in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], whose goal is to produce and spread Greek and international films. It's a part of [[International Federation of Film Archives]] and a founding member of the [[European Film Gateway]]. It is also co-operating with the [[Thessaloniki International Film Festival]].

It's located in the Laϊs theatre, in [[kerameikos]], and consists of four departments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tainiothiki.gr/v2/lang_en/about/sections/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The organization was founded in 1963, with the 105/1963 royal decree and is a successor to the '''Athens cinema club''' which was founded in 1950 from the Athens film critics union. The first president of the organization was [[:el:Μόνα Μητροπούλου|Aglaia Mitropoulou]], who thanks to her friendship with the director of the [[Cinémathèque Française]] [[Henri Langlois]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kathimerini.gr/368826/article/politismos/arxeio-politismoy/h-epomenh-sekans-sth-laida&lt;/ref&gt;, managed to get ahold of many films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Ιστορικό|url = http://www.tainiothiki.gr/v2/about/history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2014, The Greek Film Archive was declared by the [[Hellenic Parliament]], as an official body that reserves film heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Η Ταινιοθήκη της Ελλάδος επίσημος φορέας διαφύλαξης κινηματογραφικής κληρονομιάς|url = http://www.tanea.gr/news/culture/article/5192995/h-tainiothhkh-ths-ellados-epishmos-foreas-diafylakshs-kinhmatografikhs-klhronomias/|publisher = [[Τα Νέα]]|date =  23 December 2014|accessdate = 27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Στην Ταινιοθήκη η διαφύλαξη της οπτικοακουστικής κληρονομιάς|url = http://www.avgi.gr/article/5166466/stin-tainiothiki-i-diafulaxi-tis-optikoakoustikis-klironomias|publisher = [[Η Αυγή]]|date = 24 December 2014|accessdate = 27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Στην Ταινιοθήκη της Ελλάδος η προστασία της κινηματογραφικής κληρονομιάς|url =http://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/887221/stin-tainiothiki-tis-ellados-i-prostasia-tis-kinimatografikis-klironomias|publisher = [[Ναυτεμπορική]]|date = 4 December 2014|accessdate = 27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 37th Cinéma du réel, which took place in [[Paris]], the Greek Film Archive was honored as the honorary film archive of the year.

==Archives==
The archive consists of more than 10.000 films, of which 600 are of Greek origin.

==Purpose==
* The collection of films of any kind, Greek or foreign, their classification, conservation, (restoration as required), safekeeping as well as their promotion through public screenings.
* The gathering and conservation of cinematographic documents (photographs, articles, books, screenplays, set models, newspapers, costumes, advertising material, programmes, and, in general, anything that has to do with the history of Cinema).
* Maintaining contact with similar foreign organizations and FIAF, as well as the development of cultural and artistic relations and the joint hosting of events.
* The organization of regular screenings, research into the technical and historical development of the cinema, and, finally, the creation of the Museum of Cinematography

{{quotebox|align=right|width=25%|quote=Harry has developed a sudden enthusiasm for litigation. What with North Hull Harry wants a fair buzz of legal activity. Harry's financial problems apparently have been solved and he's in a generous mood.|source=&lt;small&gt;Extract from a "Harry" letter, dated 2 February 1966, just after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s by-election victory in [[Hull North by-election, 1966|Hull North]]&lt;ref name="Power2001"/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;|quoted=yes}}
The "'''Harry'''" '''letters''', written by [[Peter Benenson]], founder of the international human rights group [[Amnesty International]], detail the funding during 1966 of Amnesty's mission in the [[Rhodesian]] capital of [[Harare|Salisbury]] by somebody or something referred to as "Harry", commonly interpreted as code for the British government, then headed by Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]]. The letters were made public in March 1967 by [[Polly Toynbee]], an Englishwoman who had worked for Amnesty in Salisbury while a 19-year-old [[gap year]] student during early 1966. Scandal resulted within both the British government and Amnesty; Benenson left the group soon after.

While with Amnesty in Rhodesia, Toynbee became suspicious of the disproportionately large amounts of money apparently at the disposal of Amnesty's mission there, as well as the modest scale of Amnesty's operations in both Rhodesia and Nigeria. Toynbee asked Benenson about the origin of the money, and pressed him on rumours that Britain was funding Amnesty's mission in Salisbury; according to her, he admitted it, and referred to it as "Operation ''Lordship''". This ran at odds with Amnesty's claimed apolitical stance. Toynbee subsequently acquired a set of letters that appeared to confirm her suspicions. Addressed to an Amnesty official in Salisbury, they described efforts to gain external financing for the Rhodesia mission. Toynbee made the existence of the letters public in March 1967, concurrently alleging that Amnesty had been "bought off" by [[Government of the United Kingdom|Whitehall]].&lt;ref name=CathHld67/&gt;

When questioned in Parliament on payments by the government to Amnesty, Wilson said that his administration had indeed been "approached by a member of the organisation",&lt;ref name='Hansard67'/&gt; and had given a list of possible financial donors in response. Amnesty claimed that any such activities had been unilaterally conducted by Benenson on his own accord, and denied any collective wrongdoing. Benenson held that the money had been intended for Rhodesian political prisoners and their families, and said that the British government had wished for the payments to be kept secret for political reasons. The relationship between Whitehall and Amnesty was ended as a result of the affair, with Amnesty reaffirming its official impartiality.

==Rhodesia mission==
[[File:PollyToynbee.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Polly Toynbee]] in 2005]]
In early 1966, during her [[gap year]] from studies at [[Oxford University]], [[Polly Toynbee]] served as the secretary for the peer and former [[West Indies cricket team|West Indian]] cricketer [[Learie Constantine]] on an [[Amnesty International]] mission to [[Nigeria]] and [[Rhodesia]],&lt;ref name="Power2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=indie261106&gt;{{cite news|first=Andy|last=McSmith|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/polly-toynbee-reborn-as-a-lady-of-the-right-425833.html|title=Polly Toynbee: Reborn, as a lady of the right|newspaper=The Independent|location=London|date=26 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; two countries in Africa.{{refn|group=n|name=rhodesia|Following its 1965 [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]], Rhodesia regarded itself as an independent country, while Britain and the United Nations held that it was still a British colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

We must have spent an enormous amount but we never achieved anything. We never saw anyone important. We just got vague assurances that the prisoners were all right."&lt;ref name="Power2001"/&gt; The mission then went on to Rhodesia, where the predominantly white minority government under [[Ian Smith]] had [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] the previous November. Since the declaration of independence there had been reports of mass arrests of black nationalist leaders.&lt;ref name="Power2001"/&gt;

During Toynbee's six weeks in [[Harare|Salisbury]], Toynbee and other volunteers dispensed funds to the families of political detainees, and tried to arrange legal aid for the prisoners. Toynbee claimed that Amnesty's operations in both Nigeria and Rhodesia were little more than nominal, and became suspicious of the financial situation surrounding the Salisbury mission in particular. Although Amnesty then had a modest budget for such a prominent organisation—it operated out of Benenson's cramped legal chambers, and during the financial year 1965–66 boasted an annual budget of only £7,000—Toynbee said she found that there was, in her own words, a seemingly "endless supply of money. I could go to the bank and draw out £200 at a time. And there was no check on what I did with the money."&lt;ref name="Wong2008"&gt;{{cite book|first=Wendy H.|last=Wong|title=Centralizing Principles: How Amnesty International Shaped Human Rights Politics Through Its Transnational Network|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fiGp0VNkNvwC&amp;pg=PA126|accessdate=18 November 2012|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-54464-7|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Amnesty founder [[Peter Benenson]] visited the group in Salisbury, Toynbee asked him where the funds came from, saying there were rumours flying around the city that it was coming from [[Government of the United Kingdom|Whitehall]], the British government. According to Toynbee, Benenson said the British government was indeed supplying money.&lt;ref name="Power2001"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jonathan|last=Power|title=Like Water on Stone: The Story of Amnesty International|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njElm3dJLKwC&amp;pg=PA129|accessdate=12 November 2012|date=17 May 2001|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-55553-487-5|pages=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly described the transactions as "Operation ''Lordship''".&lt;ref name="Wong2008"/&gt;

==Toynbee reveals the letters==
Toynbee and others were expelled from Rhodesia in March 1966 for refusing information to the [[British South Africa Police|police]].&lt;ref name="Forsythe2009"/&gt; While she was there, however, she acquired some letters that she said had been abandoned in a safe. The letters appeared to have been written in London by Benenson between January and March 1966; some were typed, while others were in his handwriting. Alternately signed "Margaret" or "Peter", and addressed to the Amnesty representative in Salisbury, they contained frequent references to somebody or something called "Harry", which Toynbee interpreted as code for the UK government.&lt;ref name="Power2001"/&gt;

Many of the letters contained detailed requests for payments and funding. One of them, dated 2 February 1966, included the passage "What with North Hull Harry wants a fair buzz of legal activity. Harry's financial problems apparently have been solved and he's in a generous mood."&lt;ref name="Power2001"/&gt; Toynbee construed this as a reference to the [[Hull North by-election, 1966|Hull North by-election]] of the previous month, which had increased the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government's majority in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] from three to four members.&lt;ref name="Power2001"/&gt; Toynbee's interest was aroused as Amnesty took pride in its declared apolitical stance, a concept very much at odds with the idea of funding from a national government.&lt;ref name=CathHld67&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/17th-march-1967/3/spiller-of-beans|title=Spiller of Beans|newspaper=[[The Catholic Herald]]|date=17 March 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 1967, Toynbee revealed the existence of the letters in newspaper interviews.&lt;ref name="Wong2008"/&gt; She claimed that Amnesty had been "bought off" by the British government; "Instead of dealing with legal test cases," she said, "it is wasting its time on welfare work which could equally well be done by the Red Cross".&lt;ref name=CathHld67/&gt;

==Fallout==
[[File:Dodwilson.JPG|thumb|left|upright|British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] admitted the UK government's involvement in the affair in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref name='Hansard67'/&gt;|alt=Harold Wilson looks up and to the viewer's right, looking somewhat indignant.]]
The letters' public appearance caused a scandal.&lt;ref name="Power2001"/&gt; Amnesty distanced itself from the Rhodesia mission, claiming that any such activities had been unilaterally undertaken by Benenson alone.&lt;ref name="Wong2008"/&gt; On 9 March, in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] answered a [[parliamentary question]] on the letters from [[Knox Cunningham]], who asked whether or not the "payments made to Amnesty International were made with his [Wilson's] authority; for what reason such payments were made; and what was the total amount paid by Her Majesty's Government during 1966 to Amnesty International."&lt;ref name='Hansard67'&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1967/mar/09/amnesty-international-donations|title=Amnesty International (Donations)| publisher=Hansard|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson replied that the government had been "approached by a member of the organisation concerned for the humanitarian purpose of helping the families of men who have been oppressively detained. We thought it right to suggest possible donors who might be willing to help."&lt;ref name='Hansard67'/&gt;

Benenson contended that the money had been for the prisoners and their families, and had not been gifted to Amnesty by the government. He insisted that the British government had wished the payments to remain secret for political reasons.&lt;ref name="Power2001"/&gt; A private letter written by Benenson two months before Toynbee's interviews said that a third party, the hotelier [[Charles Forte, Baron Forte|Charles Forte]], had been asked by Whitehall to provide £10,000 for the Rhodesia mission. In his letter, Benenson appeared to imply that Forte's donation might lead to an honour from the British government. Benenson later returned the money so as not to jeopardise the political reputation of the British government members involved in the payments.&lt;ref name="Forsythe2009"/&gt;

Following a state of crisis, Amnesty held a meeting in Denmark in March 1967, where Benenson's resignation was accepted. Benenson resigned on the grounds that Amnesty's offices had been bugged by the British government. In a report, Amnesty chairman [[Seán MacBride]] referred to Beneson's "erratic activities" and "unilateral decisions". Benenson responded by demanding MacBride's resignation, pointing out that the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] had funded the [[International Commission of Jurists]], of which MacBride was Secretary-General. The relationship between Amnesty and the British government was thereupon suspended. Amnesty vowed future impartiality, saying that it "must not only be independent and impartial but it must not be put into a position where anything else could even be alleged".&lt;ref name="Forsythe2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=David P.|last=Forsythe|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QbX90fmCVUC&amp;pg=PA164|accessdate=12 November 2012|date=11 August 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533402-9|pages=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehall concurrently switched its stance towards Amnesty from one of co-operation to "one of reserve".&lt;ref name="Forsythe2009"/&gt;

'''Sir Henry Enfield Roscoe''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]}} (7 January 1833 – 18 December 1915) was a British [[chemist]]. He is particularly noted for early work on [[vanadium]] and for [[photochemistry|photochemical]] studies.

== Life and work ==
[[Image:Kirchhoff Bunsen Roscoe.jpg|thumb|255px|right|Kirchhoff, Bunsen, and Roscoe (1862)]]
Henry Enfield Roscoe was born in [[London]], the son of [[Henry Roscoe (legal writer)|Henry Roscoe]] (1800–1836) and Maria Roscoe (née Fletcher)(1798-1885), and grandson of [[William Roscoe]] (1753–1831).&lt;ref&gt;See the two-volume biography: {{cite book|author = Roscoe, Henry|title = The Life of William Roscoe|year = 1833|volume = 1|publisher = T. Cadell|location = London|url = https://archive.org/details/lifewilliamrosc00roscgoog}} and {{cite book|author = Roscoe, Henry|title = The Life of William Roscoe|year = 1833|volume = 2|publisher = T. Cadell|location = London| url = https://archive.org/details/lifewilliamrosc05roscgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Stanley Jevons]] was a cousin.

Roscoe studied at the [[Liverpool Institute for Boys]] and [[University College London]]. He then went to [[Heidelberg]] to work under [[Robert Bunsen]], who became a lifelong friend. He also befriended [[William Dittmar]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830901185.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1857, Roscoe returned to England with Dittmar and was appointed to the chair of chemistry at [[Owens College]], [[Manchester]], with Dittmar as his assistant. Roscoe remained at the college until 1886 by which time the [[Victoria University (UK)|Victoria University]] had been established.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, H. B. (1951) Portrait of a University: chap. IV College to University: the Roscoe-Ward Epoch. Manchester: University Press&lt;/ref&gt; From 1885 to 1895 he was MP for [[Manchester South (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester South]]. He served on several royal commissions appointed to consider educational questions, in which he was keenly interested, and from 1896 to 1902 was vice-chancellor of the [[University of London]]. He was knighted in 1884.

Roscoe's scientific work includes a memorable series of researches carried out with Bunsen between 1855 and 1862, in which they laid the foundations of comparative photochemistry. In 1864 they carried out what is reputed to be the first [[Flash (photography)|flashlight photography]], using [[magnesium]] as a light source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Roscoe (1833–1915): flashlight photography|publisher=[[Museum of Science and Industry (Manchester)]]|year=2007|url=http://emu.msim.org.uk/htmlmn/collections/online/browsethemes/relatedobjects_lower.php?irn=2386|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, Roscoe began an elaborate investigation of vanadium and its compounds, and devised a process for preparing it pure in the metallic state, at the same time showing that the substance which had previously passed for the pure metal was contaminated with [[oxygen]]. In so doing he corrected [[Berzelius]]'s value for the [[atomic mass]]. Roscoe was awarded the 1868 [[Bakerian Lecture]] for this work. He also carried out researches on [[niobium]], [[tungsten]], [[uranium]], [[perchloric acid]], and the [[solubility]] of [[ammonia]].

He was the uncle of [[Beatrix Potter]]. The mineral [[Roscoelite]] was named after him, due to its vanadium content and Roscoe's work on that element.

Roscoe received an honorary doctorate ([[Legum Doctor|LL.D]]) from the [[University of Glasgow]] in June 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Glasgow University jubilee |day_of_week=Friday |date=14 June 1901 |page_number=10 |issue=36481}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1909 he was sworn in the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28311|date=23 November 1909|page=8661}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Franklin Institute]]'s [[The Franklin Institute Awards|Elliott Cresson Medal]] in 1912.

==Publications==
Roscoe's publications include, besides several elementary books on chemistry that had a wide circulation and were translated into many foreign languages, ''Lectures on Spectrum Analysis'' (1869); a ''Treatise on Chemistry'' (the first edition of which appeared in 1877–1892); ''A New View of Dalton's Atomic Theory'', with Dr [[Arthur Harden]] (1896); and an Autobiography (1906). The ''Treatise on Chemistry'', written in collaboration with [[Carl Schorlemmer]] (1834–1892), who was appointed his private assistant at Manchester in 1859, official assistant in the laboratory in 1861, and professor of organic chemistry in 1874, was long regarded as a standard work. Roscoe's ''Lessons in Elementary Chemistry'' (1866) passed through many editions in the UK and abroad.

{{nihongo|'''Yasuhiro Kojima'''|小島 泰弘|Kojima Yasuhiro}}, (July 22, 1937 – November 27, 1999),  was a [[Japanese-American]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and trainer best known by his [[ring name]] '''Hiro Matsuda'''. He trained many professional wrestlers including [[Hulk Hogan]], [[The Great Muta]], [["Mr. Wonderful" Paul Orndorff]], [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]], [[Lex Luger]], [["Cowboy" Bob Orton]], and [[Ron Simmons]].

==Professional wrestling career==
Kojima adopted his Hiro Matsuda identity while competing in the southern United States, inspired by earlier wrestlers [[Sorakichi Matsuda]] and Matty Matsuda. He initially debuted under his real name at [[Rikidōzan]]'s [[Japanese Wrestling Association]], but then left Japan to pursue wrestling in the Americas. Once in a while he would return to Japan, where he formed a tag team with [[Antonio Inoki]] that was only the outward reflection of the long-time friendship between the two men.

Matsuda was the first Japanese to win a [[National Wrestling Alliance]] world singles title when he won the [[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship|junior heavyweight championship]] on July 11, 1964, in Tampa, Florida by defeating [[Danny Hodge]]. He would win a second title in 1975 and lose it to Hodge.

As a trainer, Matsuda was famous for being very [[Stiff (professional wrestling)|stiff]] with his trainees to toughen them up and teach them to respect the business. He was very tough on a young Hulk Hogan; on his first day of training, Matsuda broke his leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://in.news.yahoo.com/hulk-hogan-politics-wrestling-training-074008098.html|title=Hulk Hogan on politics in wrestling, how training methods have changed, more|author=Snehartha|publisher=Yahoo News|accessdate=June 15, 2017|date=June 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hogan healed, he came right back to Matsuda's school, looking to continue his training. Matsuda was so impressed by his display of "guts" that he trained him properly from that day on.

He came to work in [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] in 1987 as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] to participate in a feud between his disciple [[Lex Luger]] and [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], plus wrestled a few matches on TV with [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]] manager James J Dillon acting as his manager. Matsuda was in Luger's corner. During the feud, he was billed as "The Master of the Japanese Sleeper," a [[Professional wrestling holds#Sleeper hold|sleeper hold]]. He famously locked [[Johnny Weaver]], who was in Rhodes' corner, in the hold. The prolonged application of the hold caused Weaver to bleed profusely from the mouth.

He later on worked briefly for [[World Championship Wrestling]] acting as the [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] in early 1989 for the [[Yamasaki Corporation]] (a renamed Four Horsemen) and then being involved in [[Terry Funk]]'s [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]], [[J-Tex Corporation|The J-Tex Corporation]] as their business agent from [[Japan]].  As was the case with [[Tojo Yamamoto]], he was frequently made the manager or spokesman of Japanese wrestlers on excursion in the United States. In this role, he "introduced" [[The Great Muta]] (managed by [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]]) on a ''World Championship Wrestling'' episode.

Kojima died in 1999 in [[Tampa, Florida]] of [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.femmezuigiri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hulk-hogan-this-is-where-the-power-lies.png&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indian ghost movies''' are popular not just in [[India]] but in the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[South East Asia]] and other parts of the world. Generally the movies are based on the experiences of modern people who are unexpectedly exposed to ghosts. Some Indian ghost movies, such as the comedy/horror film ''Chandramukhi'', have been great hits, dubbed into several languages.&lt;ref name=behind&gt;{{cite web

==Box office hits==

The 1949 ''[[Mahal (1949 film)|Mahal]]'' ([[Hindi]]: महल; [[Urdu]]: محل; [[English language|English]]: ''The Mansion'') was a groundbreaking [[Hindi language]] movie directed by [[Kamal Amrohi]] and starring [[Ashok Kumar]] and [[Madhubala]], one of the earliest known [[Bollywood]] films dealing with [[reincarnation]]. ''Mahal'' became one of the biggest box office hits of 1949 in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upperstall.com/films/mahal.html Mahal (1949)] Classic Films at upperstall&lt;/ref&gt; The movie paved the way for Indian [[gothic fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Mishra|first=Vijay|title=Bollywood cinema: temples of desire|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2002|isbn=0-415-93014-6|pages=49–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Chandramukhi]]'' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: சந்திரமுகி; [[Telugu language|Telugu]]: చంద్రముఖి; [[Hindi]]: चंद्रमुखी) (2005) is a [[horror film|horror]], [[comedy film|comedy]] and [[drama film]] directed by [[P. Vasu]] and produced by [[Ramkumar Ganesan]]. The soundtrack and background score for the film, which later became successful enough to be released as a separate album, was written by [[Vidyasagar (music director)|Vidyasagar]]. It was later dubbed into several languages, and became one of the highest grossing [[Tamil language|Tamil]] film ever.&lt;ref name=behind/&gt;
''Chandramukhi'' is a remake of the 2004 [[Kannada]] film ''[[Apthamitra]]'', which was the highest grossing Kannada film in recent times. The movie tells of the experiences of a married couple who buy an ancient palace in [[Mysore]] that turns out to be haunted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Common themes==
The ghost movies often concern modern people unexpectedly involved in the ghostly results of past events. 
''[[Bhoot (film)|Bhoot]]'' ([[Hindi]]: भूत, [[English language|English]]: Ghost) (2003) was directed by [[Ram Gopal Varma]] and starring [[Urmila Matondkar]] and [[Ajay Devgan]]. A couple takes an apartment that turns out to have a horrifying past. A series of inexplicable experiences drives the wife to near madness. Bhoot was perceived to be different from a typical Bollywood movie as it did not contain songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0341266|title=Bhoot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Krishna Cottage]]'' (2004) starring [[Sohail Khan]], [[Natassha]], and [[Ishaa Koppikar]] is a horror story that includes ghosts, death, reincarnation, and love, revolving around a fictional book "Kayi Unkahi Batein" (a few untold things) by Professor Siddharth Das ([[Rajendranath Zutshi]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|408976|Krishna Cottage}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have a more philosophical theme.
In ''[[Hum Tum Aur Ghost]]'', starring [[Arshad Warsi]] and [[Dia Mirza]], the hero is a charming fashion photographer whose life is marred by the fact that he hears voices that nobody else can hear, which disrupts his social life. He becomes aware of his special ability to connect with the souls that haven't crossed over, and sets out on a journey where he assists three souls, in the process learning much about himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movies/preview/14125/index.html |title=Bollywood Forum: Bollywood Talk &amp;#124; Bollywood Community &amp;#124; Bollywood Discussion |publisher=Bollywoodhungama.com |date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations from Indian literature==

Indian ghost movies are often based on Indian novels or short stories about ghosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Bollywood Horror Movies To Give You The Real Chills|url=https://in.bookmyshow.com/entertainment-news/movies/best-bollywood-horror-movies-give-real-chills|website=BookMyShow|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Anandabhadram]]'' ([[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]: അനന്തഭദ്രം) is a [[Malayalam cinema|Malayalam]] [[film]] released in 2005 about [[ghost]]s, [[Spirit#Metaphysical and metaphorical uses|spirits]], and [[black magic]], based on the award-winning novel of the same name by Sunil Parameswaran.&lt;ref name="novel"&gt;{{cite news

It is the first [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] venture of [[Cinema of India|Indian]] [[film director|director]] [[Santosh Sivan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chennaionline.com/film/Moviereviews/2005/12anandabhadram.asp Ananthabhadram on Chennai Online]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as of Bengali model/actress [[Riya Sen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Riya Sen in Ananthabhadram | publisher = That's Malayalam | url = http://thatsmalayalam.oneindia.in/movie/news/2005/03/031205riyasen.html | accessdate = 2007-03-29 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20061022173943/http://thatsmalayalam.oneindia.in/movie/news/2005/03/031205riyasen.html | archivedate = 2006-10-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The story of ''Ananthabhadram'' is a [[fairy tale]]. Set in rural Kerala, the tale is dominated by black magicians, [[martial arts]] experts, [[magician (fantasy)|sorcerers]] and [[seduction|seductresses]]. Sivan said "it was the story of Ananthabhadram that captivated me. The stories my grandmother used to tell me used to take me to a world of mystery. It was the same feeling when I heard this story and I have tried to capture that in my film."&lt;ref name="flashback"&gt;{{cite news | title = In flashback mode | publisher = The Hindu | date = 2006-08-02 | url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2005/11/19/stories/2005111901040100.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Paheli]]'' ([[Devanagari]]: पहेली, [[Nastaliq]]: پہیلی, {{lang-en|Riddle}}) (2005) was directed by [[Amol Palekar]] and produced by [[Gauri Khan]], Sanjiv Chawla and [[Shahrukh Khan]], who also plays the male lead. It is based on the short story written by [[Vijayadan Detha]] and tells the story of a wife ([[Rani Mukerji]]) who is left by her husband ([[Shahrukh Khan]]) and visited by a ghost, disguised as her husband, who is in love with her and takes her husband's place.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0451850|Paheli}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Duvidha]]'' (1973) was directed by [[Mani Kaul]] and was critically acclaimed and won Best Film at the 1974 [[Filmfare Awards]]. The film is based on a story by [[Vijayadan Detha]] which relates a popular folktale from [[Rajasthan]] about merchant’s son whose relationship with his young bride is thwarted by his work and a ghost who falls in love with her, resulting in the ghost soon impersonating the husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0070009|title=Duvidha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Shodh]]'' (1981) is based on the book ''Steaming Rice and a Ghost Story'' by [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]]. Surendra ([[Om Puri]]), having been exiled from his village in youth and established himself in the city, comes back to the news of his father's demise, reportedly at the hands of a phantom. He announces a prize for anyone who succeeds in showing him a ghost, which attracts the greed of the poor hungry peasants, resulting in the accusations of innocent people as haunted and even murders with the hope of producing a ghost.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0267924|title=Shodh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations from Western sources==

Some Bollywood ghost movies are adapted from Western sources, with varying degrees of success.
The 2003 ''[[Saaya (2003 film)|Saaya]]'' ([[Hindi]]: साया, [[Urdu]]: '''سایا''', [[Indian English|translation]]: ''Shadow'') is a direct lift of the 2002 Hollywood film [[Dragonfly (2002 film)|Dragonfly]].
''[[Raaz (2002 film)|Raaz]]'' ([[Hindi]]: राज़, [[Urdu]]: راز, [[translation]]: ''Secret'') (2002) directed by [[Vikram Bhatt]], is an unofficial [[Bollywood]] adaptation of the 2000 film ''[[What Lies Beneath]]''.&lt;ref name=aping&gt;{{cite web

The film is based on the story of a couple who have moved to [[Ooty]] to save their failing marriage. However, what they find in their new home is more than they expected when a ghost starts haunting the place. Sanjana suddenly finds that her husband is part of the ghostly conspiracy, which she must fix in order to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''[[Anjaane (2005 film)|Anjaane]]'' (2005) starred [[Manisha Koirala]], [[Sanjay Kapoor]], Tejasvini Kolhapure and [[Helen Jairag Richardson|Helen]]. The film was based on [[Alejandro Amenábar]]'s ghost story [[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]] starring [[Nicole Kidman]]. The film was criticized for being a copycat of the American version and the acting of Koirala was described by reviewers as "uninterested" and "mechanical".&lt;ref name=anjaane/&gt;
''[[Bhoothnath]]'' ([[Devanagari]]: भूतनाथ [[translation]]: "Lord of Ghosts") directed by Vivek Sharma and produced by [[Ravi Chopra]], is an adaptation of the [[Oscar Wilde]] short-story [[The Canterville Ghost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Influence on Western movies==

Some [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] movies refer to Bollywood ghost movies. For example, the 2001 movie ''[[Ghost World (film)|Ghost World]]'' by [[Terry Zwigoff]] includes a clip from the 1965 hit ''[[Gumnaam]]'' by [[Raja Nawathe]], which tells of a group of travelers in an isolated hotel who are murdered one by one. ''Gumnaam'' itself borrows from [[Agatha Christie]]'s [[detective fiction]] novel ''[[And Then There Were None]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''killersound''' was an entity that existed from 1999 to 2008 and primarily offered a [[royalty free]] music production library. The library offered music that was customizable by the licensee. The product format delivered perfectly looping, sampled recordings of each instrument that made up a given composition. End-users could then use their own multimedia software such as [http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/ Adobe Flash] to create new arrangements of the music they had licensed.

== Company history ==
killersound was officially formed as a California corporation on April 26, 1999, and was based in the Silicon Valley region. Initially focused on original music creation for discrete client-driven projects, an additional business line was introduced in 2000. Cast-offs from the recording of original music soundtracks were enhanced, edited and produced to completion and organized into a searchable, online music library. With the debut of the second version of its killersound.com website in July 2000 at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20081108034330/http://www.flashforwardconference.com/ Flash Forward Conference &amp; Film Festival], killersound became the first online music library with fully searchable and downloadable music tracks and single-tier pricing.
Over time, the library grew to nearly 1,000 customizable and loop-able music tracks featuring several dozen composers. One of the most notable composers discovered by killersound was none other than [http://www.grammys.com/grammy_awards/51st_show/list.aspx#27 2009 Grammy Award Nominated] Artist Joel Zimmerman ([[Deadmau5]]) as well as music producer and sound designer [http://www.midihead.com MIDIhead] who has most recently created patch libraries for [http://www.ilio.com/edm Spectrasonics Omnisphere™]. Eventually, other audio products were added including sound effects collections and multimedia bundles of images and audio. Later in the 2000s, the company found success re-purposing and licensing its material for the mobile phone ring tone market.

== Achievements ==
Helping to launch the new business direction towards the production music library model, company co-founder, Frank Gelat [http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/composersforum/composers/gelat/index.html (bio)] helped develop a technique utilizing Flash for delivering high-quality, low-bandwidth music soundtracks over narrowband, dial-up internet connections. Composers for the killersound library became accustomed to composing in this modular format for web presentations and found it lucrative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.djtimes.com/issues/2008/06/_features_06_2008.htm DJ Times Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;
Frank presented this technique in a session at the next Flash Forward Conference and his technique became widely known in the Flash community as "The killersound Technique". Given that neither [[Macromedia]] nor [[Adobe Systems]] have never developed a similar capability in subsequent versions of Flash, the technique is still useful to developers today. In fact, [[Adobe Systems]] still features the technique as it now perfectly applies to low-bandwidth audio presentation on mobile devices at Adobe.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/devices/articles/optimizing_sound.html Adobe - Developer Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13001">The '''Koenig Memorandum''' (also known as '''The Koenig Report''') was a confidential and internal  [[Israel]]i government document authored in April 1976 by [[Yisrael Koenig]], a member of the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]] (then the ruling party), who served as the Northern District Commissioner of the Ministry of the Interior for 26 years.&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;{{cite web|title=The Other Israelis|author=Yossi Klein|publisher=Ha'aretz Online, English Edition|date=November 4, 2006|accessdate=November 4, 2006|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=182985&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=5&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y&amp;itemNo=182985|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001183813/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=182985&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=5&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y&amp;itemNo=182985|archive-date=2007-10-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MERIP&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Koenig Report:Demographic Racism in Israel|publisher=Middle East Research and Information Project (MERIP)|date=October 1976|volume=51|pages=11–14|jstor=3010906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document put forward a number of strategic goals and tactical steps aimed at reducing the number and influence of [[Arab citizens of Israel]] in the [[Galilee]] region. Outlining what he viewed as "objective thought that ensures the long-term Jewish national interests," Koenig stressed the need to "examine the possibility of diluting existing Arab population concentrations".&lt;ref name=BADIL&gt;{{cite web|title=Ruling Palestine: A History of the Legally Sanctioned Jewish-Israeli Seizure of Land and Housing in Palestine|author=Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE) &amp; BADIL Resource Center for Palestinian Residency and Refugee Rights|publisher=BADIL|date=May 2005|url=http://www.badil.org/e-library/Ruling-Palestine.pdf|access-date=2006-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231185037/http://www.badil.org/e-library/Ruling-Palestine.pdf|archive-date=2006-12-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaking of the report by the Israeli newspaper [[Al Ha-Mishmar|Al-Hamishmar]] is frequently referred to as "a major turning point in the relationship between the Israeli State and the Palestinian minority."&lt;ref name=Saadi&gt;{{cite web|title=The Koenig Report and Israeli Policy Towards the Palestinian Minority, 1965 - 1975: Old Wine in New Bottles |author=Ahmad H. Sa'di |publisher=Arab Studies Quarterly |date=1 July 2003 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2501/is_3_25/ai_114519329 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624072150/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2501/is_3_25/ai_114519329 |archivedate=24 June 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The Koenig Memorandum was the first publicly available document to outline some of the "policies of discrimination and containment" that Palestinian citizens have been subject to since 1948, reflecting "planning and deliberations at the policy-making circles."&lt;ref name=Saadi/&gt; Its publication also exposed policy options that Israeli policy makers were considering prior to [[Land Day]], as its first (main) section was finalized on 1 March - one month before the events of Land Day.&lt;ref name=Saadi/&gt;

Although the Israeli Government never officially acknowledged that official government policies were guided by this plan, some of Koenig's recommendations were implemented, particularly those regarding the expansion of land expropriations from Arab owners and the establishment of new Jewish settlements in the area in order to fragment and contain the [[Palestinian Arab]] population in Israel.&lt;ref name=BADIL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discrimination Diary|publisher=Arab Human Rights Association|date=November 12, 1999|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/632/re1.htm|access-date=2006-11-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109111033/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/632/re1.htm|archive-date=2006-11-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Freedom to Take our Land|author=[[Jonathan Cook]]|publisher=Al Ahram Weekly|date=April 3–9, 2003|issue=632|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/632/re1.htm|access-date=2006-11-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109111033/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/632/re1.htm|archive-date=2006-11-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, both the Tel Aviv magazine, New Outlook and the New York newspaper Jewish Press reported in the fall of 1976 that Koenig had collaborated with prominent activists in [[Mapai]], the party of [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben-Gurion]], [[Levi Eshkol|Eshkol]], [[Golda Meir|Meir]], [[Shimon Peres|Peres]] and [[Yitzhak Rabin|Rabin]] to prepare the report, and that Zvi Aldoraty, Mapai candidate for Director of Arab Affairs, was a major co-author.&lt;ref name=Walz&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli Violations of Human Rights|author=L. Humphrey Walz|publisher=The Link, reprinted by Americans for Middle East Understanding|date=July–August 1977|volume=10|issue=3|url=http://www.ameu.org/printer.asp?iid=202&amp;aid=360|access-date=2006-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204655/http://www.ameu.org/printer.asp?iid=202&amp;aid=360|archive-date=2007-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reception==

The Koenig Memorandum came to the public’s attention in September 1976, when it was reprinted in full in [[Al Hamishmar]], a Hebrew-language newspaper in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Palestinian Education in Israel: The Legacy of the Military Government|author=Ismael Abu-Saad|work=Holy Land Studies: A Multidisciplinary Journal|volume=5|issue=1|date=May 2006|pages=21–56|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/holy_land_studies/v005/5.1abu-saad.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its publication provoked widespread debate in both the domestic and international arena.

===International reaction===

The comments of the [[Egypt]]ian Representative to the [[United Nations Security Council]], Abdul Meguid, provide one illustration of such debate in the international arena. At a meeting of the Security Council on November 1, 1976, Meguid stated, “The aims of the [[Israeli Government]] are well known, but recently one of these official plans came to the notice of public opinion: it is a secret document, known as the Koenig memorandum, presented to the Office of the Prime Minister by Mr. Koenig, who is a high official in the Israeli Interior Ministry and is responsible for the treatment of Arabs in Israel. The Israeli Government is somewhat embarrassed — or so it says — not because of the contents of this memorandum, but only because it was brought to the attention of world public opinion.”&lt;ref name=UNSC&gt;{{cite web|title= S/PV.1966|publisher=United Nations Security Council Official Records 31st Year|date=1 November 1976|url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/eed216406b50bf6485256ce10072f637/f67d4d633a025cf685256fd3006449ca!OpenDocument}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic reaction===
Domestically in Israel, the memorandum’s publication was received with a generally more muted response. The Israeli newspaper, [[Yediot Aharonot]] reported on September 7 that senior elements close to the Prime Minister attached importance to the Koenig report. Israeli radio on September 8 reported that [[Interior Minister of Israel|Interior Minister]], [[Yosef Burg]], reacted to the document’s publication by saying that he had complete faith in Mr. Koenig.&lt;ref name=UNSC/&gt;

On September 9, [[Haaretz]] newspaper reported that Amos Eiran, Director General of the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, deplored the "leaking" of the Koenig Report by Al-Hamishmar, but no governmental figures repudiated its recommendations.&lt;ref name=Walz/&gt;

Ahmad H. Sa'di, a lecturer in the Department of Politics and Government at the [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] in Israel claims that "The racist language of the Report and its draconian suggestions caused wide-ranging indignation by Palestinians. However, State officials dismissed this reaction as unwarranted. They maintained that the Report represented the opinion of its author(s), and did not represent an official policy nor did it reflect the mode of thinking in decision-making circles. The debates that followed the Report's publication have mostly centered on the limits of freedom of expression (and racism) that civil servants ought to observe, instead of dealing with the premises of the State policy towards the minority."&lt;ref name=Saadi/&gt;

==Main content==
The first section of Koenig's report is entitled, "The Demographic Problem and the Manifestations of Arab Nationalism."&lt;ref name=MERIP/&gt; In this section, Koenig claims that the Arab population of the Galilee region would constitute a majority (51%) of the population there by 1978 and that this, along with rising "nationalistic" sentiments "will endanger our control of that area."&lt;ref name=MERIP/&gt; He then proceeds to review the organizational capabilities of the [[Maki (current political party)|Rakah]] party, foreshadowing and reflecting the important role they played in [[Land Day]] demonstrations that took place on March 30, 1976, in which six [[Arab citizens of Israel]] were killed by the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] and [[Israel Police]].

In her book, "The Fate of the Jews: A People Torn Between Israeli Power and Jewish Ethics", Roberta Strauss Feuerlicht summarizes some of the major strategic objectives and tactical steps endorsed by The Koenig Memorandum, as follows:

* To preclude any possibility of an (independent, Arab) political union, Koenig recommended building more Jewish settlements in areas that are predominantly Arab. 
* Hostile Arab leaders should be replaced by compliant ones, whom Israel was to ‘create.’ Koenig wanted the number of Arab intellectuals reduced, because their frustration is potentially dangerous. He would encourage "the channeling of [Arab] students into technical professions, the physical and natural sciences. These studies leave less time for dabbling in nationalism and the dropout rate is higher." Koenig wanted to make it easier for Arabs to study abroad and harder for them to return and find jobs. Graduates who did remain in Israel were to be coopted. 
* Koenig also proposed mounting a smear campaign against Arab activists, reducing liquid savings to limit funds available in the Arab community to support political causes, and reducing the effectiveness of Arab student organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The fate of the Jews : a people torn between Israeli power and Jewish ethics|author=Roberta Strauss Feuerlicht|publisher=New York Times Books|year=1983|page=251|url= http://cosmos.ucc.ie/cs1064/jabowen/IPSC/php/art.php?aid=2871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further elements in the memorandum included Koenig's reflection that, "Social and economic security free[s] the individual and the family from economic worries ... and give[s] him, consciously and subconsciously, leisure time for social and nationalistic thoughts that are exploited by hostile elements to generate ferment and bitterness." As one practical measure to help obviate this end, Koenig proposed "neutralizing grants to large families."&lt;ref name=Klein/&gt;

An English translation of the full report appeared in ''SWASIA''.&lt;ref&gt;''A Secret Document: The "Koenig Momo"'', SWASIA, Vol III, No. 31, Oct 1976, pp1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==References to the Koenig Memorandum in books on the Middle East==
In his book, "Deliberate Deceptions: Facing the Facts About The U.S.-Israeli Relationship," [[Paul Findley]] cites among other examples, the recommendations of the Koenig Memorandum, to refute the common pro-Zionist assessment that Jewish citizens of Israel "do not have more rights than their non-Jewish fellows." He notes that these recommendations included encouraging [[emigration]] of Palestinian Arabs through study abroad programs and giving "preferential treatment to Jewish groups or individuals rather than to Arabs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book Reviews: Deliberate Deceptions: Facing the Facts About The U.S.-Israeli Relationship|author=Richard H. Curtiss|publisher=Washington Report On Middle East Affairs (WRMEA)|date=June 1993|page=70|url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0693/9306070.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent statements by Yisrael Koenig==
In Haaretz's online English Edition, Yisrael Koenig, now a pensioner, is quoted as saying that Israel's Arabs "only want to suck the best out of us." He further relates a story about a friend of his, "a rich Christian from [[Nazareth]]," who is grateful to him for Koenig's having persuaded him to immigrate to Canada. Koenig relates that the rationale he used was: "Your children will never have it good here."&lt;ref name=Klein/&gt;

The '''Laing Art Gallery''' in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[England]], is located on New Bridge Street. The gallery was designed in the Baroque style with Art Nouveau elements by architects Cackett and Burns Dick and is now a Grade II listed building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicartonline.org.uk/casestudies/regeneration/blue_carpet/ideas.php|title=Public Art Online Regeneration Case Studies - Blue Carpet|work=publicartonline.org.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017210728/http://www.publicartonline.org.uk/casestudies/regeneration/blue_carpet/ideas.php|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was opened in 1904 and is now managed by [[Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp; Museums]] and sponsored by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]].

A '''language-for-specific-purposes dictionary''' ('''LSP dictionary''') is a [[reference work]] which defines the specialised vocabulary used by experts within a particular field, for example, architecture. The discipline that deals with these [[dictionary|dictionaries]] is [[specialised lexicography]].  [[Medical dictionary|Medical dictionaries]] are well-known examples of the type.

==Users==
As described in Bergenholtz/Tarp 1995, LSP dictionaries are often made for users who are already specialists with a subject field (experts), but may also be made for semi-experts and for users who may be laypeople relative to a particular subject field. In contrast to LSP dictionaries, LGP ('''l'''anguage for '''g'''eneral '''p'''urposes) dictionaries are made to be used by an average user. LSP dictionaries may have one or more functions. LSP dictionaries may have communicative functions such as help users to translate texts, help users to understand texts and help users to produce texts. Dictionaries may also have cognitive functions such as help users to develop knowledge in general or about a specific topic, such as the birthday of a famous person and the inflectional paradigm of a specific verb.

==Different types==
According to Nielsen 1994, LSP dictionaries may cover one language (monolingual LSP dictionaries) or two languages (bilingual LSP dictionaries), and occasionally more languages. An LSP dictionary that attempts to cover as much of the vocabulary in a subject field as possible is called a [[maximizing dictionary]], and an LSP dictionary that attempts to cover a limited number of terms within a subject field is called a [[minimizing dictionary]].

Also, Nielsen 1994 distinguishes between the following types of dictionaries: An LSP dictionary that covers more than one subject field is called a [[multi-field dictionary]], an LSP dictionary that covers one subject field (e.g. a dictionary of law) is called a [[single-field dictionary]], and an LSP dictionary that covers part of a subject field (e.g. a dictionary of contract law) is called a [[sub-field dictionary]].

=== Usage dictionaries ===
A common form of LSP dictionary is a ''usage dictionary'' for a particular field or [[Genre (literature)|genre]], such as journalism, providing advice on words and phrases to prefer or prefer, and distinctions between easily confused usages.  Probably the best known of these for [[new style]] writing is the ''[[AP Stylebook]]''.  Many such works also have elements of a [[style guide]], though most of the latter are not in dictionary format, but arranged as a series of rules in sections, and more concerned with grammar and punctuation.  Some usage dictionaries are intended for a general rather than specialized audience, and are therefore more comprehensive; two major ones are ''[[Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' and ''[[Garner's Modern English Usage]]''.

This is a '''list of [[aircraft carriers]] which are currently in service, reserve, under construction, or being rebuilt'''. An aircraft carrier is a [[warship]] with a full-length [[flight deck]], [[hangar]] and facilities for arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/aircraft%20carrier]&lt;/ref&gt; The list only refers to the status of the ship, not availability or condition of an [[Carrier air wing|air wing]]. This includes [[helicopter carrier]]s and also [[amphibious assault ship]]s, if the vessel's primary purpose is to carry, arm, deploy, and recover aircraft.

[[File:3D Image of Tagalog component Languages.png|thumb|3D Pie-Chart about the languages and loanwords that comprise the Tagalog language.|right|Source languages of the Tagalog language.]]

The [[Tagalog language]] has developed a unique vocabulary since its inception from its [[Austronesian]] roots. According to [[lexographer]] [[Jose Villa Panganiban]], "of the 30,000 root words in the Tagalog language, there are close to 4,000 from Spanish, 3,000 from Malay, 2,000 from English, 2,000 from both [[Hokkien]] ([[Min Nan]]) and [[Yue Chinese dialects]], 300 from Tamil and Sanskrit, 200 from Arabic, 10 percent of Tagalog is from Nahuatl (Aztec) origins,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2017/06/28/mexico-our-older-sister/|title=Mexico, our older sister|work=Manila Bulletin News|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a few hundred altogether from other languages".

The Filipino language incorporated Spanish loanwords as a result of 333 years of contact with the Spanish language. In their review of a Pilipino-English dictionary, Llamzon and Thorpe (1972) point out that 40% of word roots are of Spanish origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Roger M. |authorlink=Roger M. Thompson |date=2003 |title=Filipino, English and Taglish - Language switching from multiple perspectives}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the sentence below in which Spanish–derived words are in italics (original in parentheses):

: '''Tagalog''': "''Puwede'' (''Puede'') ba akong umupo sa ''silya'' (''silla'') sa tabi ng ''bintana'' (''ventana'') habang nasa ''biyahe'' (''viaje'') tayo sa ''eroplano'' (''aeroplano'')?"
: '''Translation in English''': ("''May'' I sit on the ''chair'' near the ''window'' during our ''voyage'' in the ''aeroplane''?")

The adoption of the Abakada alphabet in 1940&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wika.pbworks.com/Kasaysayan |title=Ebolusyon ng Alpabetong Filipino |accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; changed the spelling of most of the Spanish loanwords present in the Filipino language.

Other loanwords derived from the Spanish language underwent spelling and pronunciation changes. Vowel changes can be observed to some of the Spanish words upon adoption into the Filipino language. For example, an /i/ to /a/ vowel shift can be observed in the Filipino word ''paminta'', which came from the Spanish word ''pimienta''.&lt;ref name=Forastieri /&gt; A rare vowel change from /e/ to /u/ can be observed in the words ''unano'' (from Sp. ''enano'') and ''umpisa'' (from Sp. ''empezar''). Other words derived from Spanish underwent vowel deletion upon adoption into the Filipino language, such as the words ''pusta'' (from Sp. ''apostar''), ''tarantado'' (from Sp. ''atarantado''), ''kursonada'' (from Sp. ''corazonada''), ''Pasko'' (from Sp. ''Pascua'') and ''labi'' (from Sp. ''labio'').&lt;ref name=Forastieri /&gt; Consonant shifts can also be observed to some of the Spanish words upon their adoption into the Filipino language. The [r] to [l] consonant shift can be observed in the following words: ''albularyo'' (witch doctor or folk healer, from Sp. ''herbolario''), ''alma'' (from Sp. ''armar''), ''almusal'' (from Sp. ''almorzar''), ''asukal'' (from Sp. ''azúcar''), ''balbas'' (from Sp. ''barba''), ''bandila'' (from. Sp. ''bandera''), ''dasal'' (from Sp. ''rezar''), ''hibla'' (thread or strand, from Sp. ''hebra''), ''hilo'' (dizzy, from Sp. ''giro''), ''hulmá'' (to mould, from Sp. ''ahormar''), ''kasal'' (from Sp. ''casar''), ''kumpisal'' (from Sp. ''confesar''), ''litratista'' (photographer, from Sp. ''retratista''), ''litrato'' (photograph, portrait or picture; from Sp. ''retrato''), ''multo'' (from Sp. ''muerto''), ''nunal'' (from Sp. ''lunar''), ''pastol'' (from Sp. ''pastor'') and ''pasyal'' (from Sp. ''pasear''). The loss of the /l/ phoneme can be observed in the Filipino word ''kutson'' derived from the Spanish ''colchón''. The loss of the /t/ phoneme can be observed in the Filipino words ''talino''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lopez |first1=Cecilio |title=The Spanish overlay in Tagalog |journal=Lingua |date=1 January 1965 |volume=14 |page=481 |doi=10.1016/0024-3841(65)90058-6 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0024384165900586 |language=en |issn=0024-3841}}&lt;/ref&gt; (intelligence or wisdom, from Sp.

''tinta''). Some Spanish-derived words have also undergone consonant or syllable deletion upon introduction to Tagalog like in the case of ''limos'' (from Sp. ''limosna''), ''masyado'' (from Sp. ''demasiado''), ''posas'' (from Sp. ''esposas''), ''restawran'' (from Sp. ''restaurante''), ''riles'' (rail, railway or railroad; from Sp. ''carriles''), ''sindi'' (from Sp. third-person singular present tense conjugation of the verb ''encender'') and ''sintonado'' (from Sp. ''desentonado'').&lt;ref name=Quilis2008 /&gt;

The Spanish digraph [ll] is pronounced by the Spaniards as /j/ during the Renaissance era and this reflected on the pronunciation and the spelling of Spanish-derived loanwords in Tagalog introduced before the 19th century, where the  digraph [ll] becomes [y] in Tagalog.&lt;ref name=Potet2016&gt;{{cite book |last=Potet |first=Jean-Paul G. |title=Tagalog Borrowings and Cognates |publisher=lulu.com |isbn=1326615793 |author-link=Jean-Paul G. Potet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such is the case of the words ''barya'' (from Sp. ''barilla''), ''kabayo'' (from Sp. ''caballo''), ''kutamaya'' (from. Sp. ''cota de malla''), ''lauya'' (a stew of meat and vegetables, from Sp. ''la olla''), ''sibuyas'' (from Sp. ''cebollas'') and ''tabliya'' or ''tablea'' (from Sp. ''tablilla de chocolate''). Spanish loanwords in which the digraph [ll] is pronounced as /lj/ in Tagalog were probably introduced (or reintroduced) during the 19th century by educated Peninsulares.&lt;ref name=Potet2016 /&gt; Examples include ''apelyido'' (from Sp. ''apellido''), ''balyena'' (from Sp. ''ballena''), ''kalye'' (from Sp. ''calle''), ''kutsilyo'' (from Sp. ''cuchillo''), ''makinilya'' (from Sp. ''maquinilla de escribir''), ''sepilyo'' (from Sp. ''cepillo de dientes''), ''silya'' (from Sp. ''silla'') and ''sigarilyo'' (from Sp. ''cigarrillo'').&lt;ref name=Potet2016 /&gt; There are also instances of the Spanish digraph [ll] being transformed into [l] upon adoption by Tagalog. Such is the case of the following words: ''kulani'' (lymph node, from Sp. ''collarín''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Potet |first1=Jean-Paul G. |title=Tagalog Borrowings and Cognates |date=2016 |publisher=Lulu.com |isbn=9781326615796 |pages=318-319 |url=https://books.google.it/books?id=jvOjDAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=kulani+collarin&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;), ''kursilista'' (from Sp. ''cursillista'') and ''uling'' (coal, soot or charcoal; from Sp. ''hollín''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alcantara y Antonio |first1=Teresita |title=Mga hispanismo sa Filipino: batay sa komunikasyong pangmadla ng Filipinas : pag-aaral lingguwistiko |date=1999 |publisher=Sentro ng Wikang Filipino, Unibersidad ng Pilipinas |isbn=9789718781777 |page=86 |url=https://books.google.it/books/about/Mga_hispanismo_sa_Filipino.html?id=s59kAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Others have morphed like 'ku(ha)nin' (Sp.: 'coja' + Tag.: '–nin'), which has inconspicuously developed into another pure Tagalog–sounding word. Another one is ''maamong kordero'' (from Sp. ''amo'' &amp; ''cordero''). Combined together, it conveys the description of a meek, tame, harmless human with Tagalog adjective prefix and suffix added. The compound word ''batya't palo–palo'', a must word in the laundry business where many Spanish words proliferate. The words were taken from the Spanish ''batea'' for "washing tub" and ''palo'' for "stick" or "beater", something a typical Filipino might think had no Spanish provenance at all. Others are ''umpisa'' (''empieza''), ''pulubi'' (''pobre''), ''pader'' (''pared'').

Some have acquired an entirely new meaning, such as ''kursonada'' (''corazonada'', originally meaning '"hunch"), which means "object of desire"; ''sospechoso'' is the "suspicious person" and not the "suspect" as in the original; ''insekto'' ("insecto"), which still means "insect" but also refers to a "pesty clownish person"; or even sige (''sigue''), a Spanish word for "continue" or "follow", which is now widely understood to mean "all right" or "go ahead".

Others use Spanish prefixes and/or suffixes, combined from Tagalog or other languages, without which the word can not be completed and convey its meaning. For example, ''pakialamero'' (from Tag. ''pakialam'', "to meddle" and the Sp. suffix ''–ero'', masculine subject); same as ''majongero'' ("[[mahjong]]", a Chinese word and the Sp. suffix ''–ero''). ''Daisysiete'' is a corruption and [[portmanteau]] of the [[English language in the Philippines|English]] "daisy" and the Spanish ''diecisiete'' ("seventeen"), now meaning a sweet and sexually desirable underaged (below 18, hence the number) female. ''Bastusing katawán'' (Sp.: ''basto'' &amp; Tag.: ''katawan'') is an example of a two-word term for a bombshell body

Even after the Spanish era, Tagalog is still being influenced by Spanish as new words are coined, albeit along its own terms, viz., ''alaskadór'' ("Alaska" + Sp. suffix '–ador'); ''barkada'' (from Sp.: ''barca'',"boat" to "clique"); ''bérde'' ("verde"="green", nuanced to "[[toilet humour]]" or "[[blue joke]]"); which are not readily understood in Spain or any Latin American country. In a strange twist, even if Filipinos have a chance to Tagalized words using foreign words, currently English&amp;mdash;their most accessible influence&amp;mdash;they coin words in a uniquely Hispanizing way i.e. "boksingero" (from Eng. "boxing") instead of using the Spanish "boxeador". Or "basketbolista" (from Eng. "basketball"), instead of borrowing from Spanish "baloncesto" to make it say "baloncestista" or "baloncestador" (although basketball "básquetbol" in many Latin American countries).

Here are some examples of Spanish–derived Tagalog words in the following format:
Word (Etymology – Original Definition/s if different from Nuanced Definition. = Derivative Definition if Compound Words) – Nuanced Definition. Shared Definition precedes Nuanced Definition if both exist.

Note that the first syllable of loanwords from Spanish that start with /aw/ are also sometimes pronounced and spelled /o/ (e.g. 'otonomiya' rather than 'awtonomiya') due to the predominance of pronunciation of loanwords from English.

===Loanwords that underwent semantic shift===

Upon adoption into Tagalog, a number of Spanish-derived terms underwent a process of [[semantic shift]] or change in meaning. A loanword is said to have undergone a semantic shift if its meaning in Tagalog deviates from the original meaning of the word in the source language (in this case, Spanish). A type of semantic shift is the so-called ''semantic narrowing'', which is a linguistic phenomenon in which the meaning of a Spanish-derived word acquires a less general or inclusive meaning upon adoption into Tagalog. Semantic narrowing occurs when a word undergoes specialization of usage. For example, the word ''kuryente'' (meaning "electricity" or "electric current") comes from the Spanish word ''corriente'', which is a general term to refer to any current, whether electric or not. Upon adoption of the word ''corriente'' into Tagalog as ''kuryente'', it underwent a semantic narrowing and its usage became restricted to refer only to an electric current, unlike its Spanish counterpart. Another example of a semantic narrowing is the Tagalog word ''ruweda'' (meaning "[[Ferris wheel]]"), a term derived from the Spanish word ''rueda'' which refers to any kind of wheel. Upon adoption into Tagalog, ''ruweda'' underwent usage specialization and its meaning became restricted to the Ferris wheel.

Semantic shift may also occur through semantic interference by another language, usually the English language. This phenomenon can result into reinterpretation of a Spanish-derived term by attributing to it an English meaning upon assimilation into Tagalog. An example is the Tagalog word ''libre'', which is derived from the Spanish translation of the English word ''free'', although used in Tagalog with the meaning of "without cost or payment" or "free of charge", a usage which would be deemed incorrect in Spanish as the term ''gratis'' would be more fitting. Another example is the Tagalog word ''iskiyerda'', derived from the Spanish term ''izquierda'' meaning "left" as opposed to "right", although used in Tagalog with the meaning of "to leave".

Here is the list of Spanish-derived words which underwent semantic shift upon assimilation into Tagalog:

===Tagalog words derived from pluralized Spanish nouns===

Some of the Spanish loanwords in Tagalog appear in their pluralized form, marked with -s or -es. However, in Tagalog, such words are not considered as plural and when they are pluralized in Tagalog, they need to be pluralized in the way that Tagalog pluralizes native words, i.e., by placing the pluralization marker ''mga'' before the word &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bundang |first1=Rebekah |title=Spanish Loanwords in Tagalog |url=https://scholarship.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/handle/10066/10641 |page=10 |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, the word ''butones'' (meaning button used in clothing, from Sp. ''botones'') is considered singular in Tagalog and its plural form is ''mga butones''.

=== Tagalog words derived from Spanish verbs ===

Several Spanish verbs are also adopted into Tagalog. Most of them are in their infinitive form characterized by the deletion of their final /r/, like for example in the case of the Tagalog ''intindi'' (to understand) derived from the Spanish verb ''entender''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lopez |first1=Cecilio |title=The Spanish overlay in Tagalog |journal=Lingua |date=1 January 1965 |volume=14 |page=477 |doi=10.1016/0024-3841(65)90058-6 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0024384165900586 |language=en |issn=0024-3841}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This feature is also found in [[Chavacano]] verbs which have a Spanish origin and it can be argued that an already restructured form of Spanish ([[Chavacano]] or a pidgin) was the origin of these Tagalog words&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stolz |first1=Thomas |last2=Bakker |first2=Dik |last3=Salas Palomo |first3=Rosa |title=Hispanisation: the impact of Spanish on the lexicon and grammar of the indigenous languages of Austronesia and the Americas |date=2008 |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |isbn=9783110207231 |page=209 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/hispanisation-the-impact-of-spanish-on-the-lexicon-and-grammar-of-the-indigenous-languages-of-austronesia-and-the-americas/oclc/651862960}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A list of these loanwords can be viewed below.

Alternatively, upon adoption into Tagalog, the final /r/ of the Spanish verbs in their infinitive form becomes /l/. Such is the case of the following loanwords: ''almusal'' (to have breakfast, from Sp. ''almorzar''), ''dasal'' (from Sp. ''rezar''), ''kasal'' (from Sp. ''casar''), ''kumpisal'' (from Sp. ''confesar''), ''minindal'' (from Sp. ''merendar''), ''pasyal'' (from Sp. ''pasear'') and ''sugal'' (from Sp. ''jugar''). In some cases, the Tagalog form is phonetically unassimilated like in the case of ''andar'' (to set in action or motion; from Sp. ''andar'').

Conjugated Spanish verbs are also adopted into Tagalog. Examples include: ''kúha'' (from Sp. ''coger''), ''pára'' (from Sp. ''parar''), ''pása'' (from Sp. ''pasar''), ''puwede'' (from Sp. ''poder''), ''tíra'' (from Sp. ''tirar'') and ''sige'' (from Sp. ''seguir''). ''Imbiyerna'' (meaning to annoy or to irritate someone) is derived from the Spanish verb ''infernar'' (meaning to irritate or to provoke) and was allegedly coined by Ricardo "Rikki" Dalu, originally to describe the hellish feeling and the frustration he experienced when attending Spanish classes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cariño |first1=Linda Grace |title=How Swardspeak was born, truly-ly! {{!}} Philstar.com |url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/sunday-life/2008/05/04/60073/how-swardspeak-was-born-truly-ly |website=philstar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In some cases, the conjugated verbs are combined with another word to form Tagalog morphemes like in the case of the following words: ''asikaso'' (from the combination of Sp. ''hacer'' and Sp. ''caso''), ''balewala'' or ''baliwala'' (from the combination of Sp. ''valer'' and Tag. ''wala''), ''etsapwera'' (from the combination of Sp. ''echar'' and Sp. ''fuera'') and ''kumusta'' (from the combination of Sp. ''cómo'' and Sp. ''estar'').

===Spanish-Tagalog hybrid compound terms===

Some Tagalog compound terms are actually formed through a combination of a native Tagalog term and an etymologically Spanish term, like in the case of the idiomatic expression ''balat-sibuyas'' (a term referring to a person's easiness to be offended), which is a combination of the Tagalog ''balat'' and Spanish ''cebolla''. The linguist Ekaterina Baklanova distinguishes at least two types of Spanish-Tagalog compound terms: ''hybrid loanwords''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baklanova |first1=Ekaterina |title=Morphological assimilation of borrowings in Tagalog |journal=SIL International |date=24 January 2013 |page=10 |url=https://www.sil.org/resources/archives/25695 |language=en |quote=While adopting a borrowing the recipient language may replace some part of the borrowing (mostly the root or its part) with the native lexical material, thus making a HYBRID LOANWORD. In the case of Tagalog borrowed morphemes may be substituted with those of PREVIOUSLY ASSIMILATED loanwords, thus some of the Tagalog hybrid loans consist only of borrowed material}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''mixed-borrowings''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baklanova |first1=Ekaterina |title=Types of Borrowings in Tagalog/Filipino |journal=Kritika Kultura |date=20 March 2017 |issue=28 |pages=42-43 |doi=10.13185/KK2017.02803 |url=https://journals.ateneo.edu/index.php/kk/article/view/KK2017.02803 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; are partially-translated Spanish terms which are adopted into Tagalog, ''e.g.'' ''karnerong-dagat'' (derived from the Spanish term ''carnero marino'', meaning "seal") and ''anemonang-dagat'' (derived from the Spanish term ''anémona de mar'', meaning "sea anemone"), while ''hybrid neologisms''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baklanova |first1=Ekaterina |title=Morphological assimilation of borrowings in Tagalog |journal=SIL International |date=24 January 2013 |page=10 |url=https://www.sil.org/resources/archives/25695 |language=en |quote=There are much more HYBRID NEOLOGISMS (CREATIONS) in the modern Tagalog, i.e. new words invented by Filipinos with use of some native and already assimilated borrowed material.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baklanova |first1=Ekaterina |title=Types of Borrowings in Tagalog/Filipino |journal=Kritika Kultura |date=20 March 2017 |issue=28 |page=45 |doi=10.13185/KK2017.02803 |url=https://journals.ateneo.edu/index.php/kk/article/view/KK2017.02803 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; are new terms invented by Filipinos with use of some native and already assimilated Spanish-derived material, ''e.g.'' ''pader-ilog'', meaning "embankment", derived from the combination of the Tagalog word ''ilog'' (meaning "river") and Spanish word ''pared'' (meaning "wall" and adopted in Tagalog as the word ''pader'').

Below is the list of some Spanish-Tagalog hybrid compound terms. Because of the lack of standardization, some of the compound terms listed below are written differently (''i.e.'' without the hyphen) in other Tagalog-based literature. For example, while the term ''sirang-plaka'' is usually encountered in many Tagalog-based works without the hyphen, there are also some instances of the term being written with the hyphen like in the case of one of the books written by the Chairman of the [[Commission on the Filipino Language]] [[Virgilio Almario]], entitled ''Filipino ng mga Filipino: mga problema sa ispeling, retorika, at pagpapayaman ng wikang pambansa''. Another example is the term ''takdang-oras'', which can also be encountered in the literature without the hyphen. As a rule, a hybrid compound term below will be hyphenated if it has at least one instance of it being written with the hyphen in Tagalog-based literary works.

==English==
[[English language|English]] has been used in everyday Tagalog conversation. This kind of conversation is called [[Taglish]]. English words borrowed by Tagalog are mostly modern and technical terms, but English words are also used for short usage (many Tagalog words translated from English are very long) or to avoid literal translation and repetition of the same particular Tagalog word. English makes the second largest vocabulary of Tagalog after Spanish. In written language, English words in a Tagalog sentence are written as they are, but they are sometimes written in Tagalog phonetic spelling. Here are some examples:

Many Malay loanwords entered the Tagalog vocabulary during pre-colonial times as [[Old Malay]] became the lingua franca of trade, commerce and diplomatic relations during the pre-colonial era of Philippine history as evidenced by the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] of 900 AD and accounts of [[Pigafetta]] at the time of the Spanish arrival in the country five centuries later.

Some Filipino jokes are based on comical reinterpretation of Japanese terms as Tagalog words like for example in the case of ''otousan'' (from the Japanese お父さん meaning "father") which is reinterpreted as ''utusan'' (meaning "servant" or "maid") in Tagalog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Potet |first1=Jean-Paul |title=Tagalog borrowings and cognates |date=2016 |publisher=Jean-Paul G.

The '''Macmillan Bible Atlas''' is a book on the geography, civilizations and cartography of the [[Holy Land]]. It describes the movements of biblical characters, trade routes and  battles. It also refers to archaeological excavations; illustrations of artifacts; and a comparative chronology of early civilizations that relate to the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1461665 Review] of the Macmillan Bible Atlas &lt;/ref&gt;

When it was first published in 1968, the [[Library Journal]] called it "one of the year's most outstanding reference books".  The third edition was published in 1993, after which a fourth (2002) and fifth (2011) edition appeared under a new title, '''Carta Bible Atlas'''.

'''Fanene Leifi Pita Maivia''' (born '''Fanene Pita Anderson'''; April 6, 1937 – June 12, 1982) was a [[Samoan Americans|Samoan-American]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] better known as '''Peter Maivia'''. He is the maternal grandfather of [[Dwayne Johnson|Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson]], part of the famous [[Anoa'i family]] and was a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promoter|promoter]] for the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] in [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name=hof/&gt;

==Wrestling career==
===New Zealand and Australia (1964-68)===
After spending his first twenty years in American Samoa, Mavia moved to New Zealand.

He began his wrestling career, wrestling not as The High Chief, but as Prince Peter Maivia. Athletic, naturally talented and a quick study, Maivia received his original ring training in [[New Zealand]], under the watchful eye of local wrestler/promoter [[Steve Rickard]].

Both in and out of the ring, Rickard taught the young Samoan a great deal about his new profession, and under his guidance, Maivia developed at an amazing rate. On August 3, 1964, after less than a year in the business, the popular rookie sensation stunned new Zealand's wrestling fanbase by toppling the rugged, experienced Rickard to win the prestigious New Zealand Heavyweight title in [[Auckland]]. The title victory was impressive, indeed, however Maivia's reign turned out to be extremely short, and he held the coveted New Zealand title for just three days, dropping the championship back to Steve Rickard in [[Wellington]] on August 6, 1964. The point had been made though, and from that period forward, Maivia enjoyed main-event status in the [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]]'s New Zealand territory.

Later in 1964, Maivia followed up his previous success by winning another very prestigious championship, the NWA Australasian Heavyweight title. Maivia became the new Australasian champion by defeating [[Kangaroo Kennedy]] in Auckland, and he would go on to carry the belt for four consecutive years before finally losing his title to Steve Rickard in 1968.

After developing his repertoire and ring skills in New Zealand, Maivia slowly began to branch out and take bookings in other (and often times larger) promotions, with success invariably following the popular islander.

===World Wide Wrestling Federation===
During his stay in the then called World Wide Wrestling Federation, he was one of its most prominent stars, making numerous appearances on [[Championship Wrestling]]. He worked matches with many well known wrestler who would go on to be [[WWE Hall of Fame]]rs, such as [[Superstar Billy Graham]], [[Ivan Putski]] and [[Bob Backlund]].

Maivia, also known as the Flying Hawaiian, was of the [[Ali'i]] lineage of [[Malietoa]].&lt;ref&gt;Ahching, Leiataua Ahching. ''Polynesian Interconnections'' (p.19)&lt;/ref&gt; Maivia's [[Pe'a|traditional Samoan tattoos]], which covered his abdomen and legs, were a symbol of his High Chief status.&lt;ref name=hof/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Funk, Terry. ''More Than Just Hardcore'' (p.197)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Superstar Billy Graham]], they were completed in three days. Maivia's grandson [[Dwayne Johnson|Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson]] revealed that they were done with traditional Samoan instrumentation: a small hammer, a needle, and ink.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Maivia disapproved of his daughter's relationship with [[Rocky Johnson]] because he was a professional wrestler.&lt;ref&gt;The Rock. ''The Rock Says...'' (p.6-7)&lt;/ref&gt; The duo married despite Maivia's objections.&lt;ref name=hof/&gt; His son, Peter Jr, also wrestled in Hawaii and the west coast after the passing of Peter Sr. sometimes under the name "Prince Peter Maivia".

Maivia was considered a "[[blood brother]]" by Amituanai Anoa'i, the father of [[the Wild Samoans]] ([[Afa Anoa'i|Afa]] and [[Sika Anoa'i|Sika]]), thus the [[Anoa'i family]] regard the Maivia line from him on forward as an extension of their own clan.

Maivia was also in the fifth [[James Bond]] film, ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'', where he plays a driver who transports a disguised Bond to Osato headquarters. His character also fights Bond, is hit with a sofa, wields a [[katana]], and is put down with a statue. He was the (uncredited) stunt fight co-ordinator for the film.

==Death==
In 1981, Maivia was diagnosed with [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=hof/&gt; He died on June 12, 1982.&lt;ref name=hof/&gt; Maivia was posthumously inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]], along with his son-in-law [[Rocky Johnson]], in 2008 by his grandson [[Dwayne Johnson]]. The award was accepted on his behalf by his daughter Ata Maivia-Johnson. During his tribute video, WWE chairman [[Vince McMahon]] refers to him as a 'tough S.O.B.' and somebody 'you didn't want to mess with' outside the ring, but added he was 'a real wonderful, likable guy'.
On October 19, 2008, Maivia's wife, [[Lia Maivia]], died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Elinor J.|last=Brecher|title=Grandmother of 'The Rock,' promoter |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/wrestling/story/741025.html|work=[[Miami Herald]]|publisher=|date=2008-10-25 |accessdate=2008-11-17}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="840">'''''R v Loubser''''' is an important case in South African criminal law, albeit with a very brief report. Its importance lies especially in the area of legal causation.

== Facts ==
A septic bandage was applied to an open wound, which had been caused in an assault.

== Judgment ==
The court there held that that circumstance did not interrupt the causal chain. [[Frans Lourens Herman Rumpff|Rumpff J]] made the declaration that, in the eyes of the law, an act is the cause of a situation if, according to human experience, the situation will flow from the act.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32348">A '''rime table''' or '''rhyme table''' ({{zh|t=韻圖|s=韵图|p=yùntú|w=yün-t'u}}) is a Chinese [[phonology|phonological]] model, tabulating the [[syllable]]s of the series of [[rime dictionaries]] beginning with the ''Qieyun'' (601) by their [[syllable onset|onset]]s, [[rhyme]] groups, [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s and other properties.  The method gave a significantly more precise and systematic account of the sounds of those dictionaries than the previously used ''[[fanqie|fǎnqiè]]'' analysis, but many of its details remain obscure.
The phonological system that is implicit in the rime dictionaries and analysed in the rime tables is known as [[Middle Chinese]], and is the traditional starting point for efforts to recover the sounds of early forms of Chinese.
Some authors distinguish the two layers as Early and Late Middle Chinese respectively.

The earliest rime tables are associated with Chinese [[Buddhist]] monks, who are believed to have been inspired by the [[Sanskrit]] syllable charts in the [[Siddham script]] they used to study the language. The oldest extant rime tables are the 12th-century ''[[Yunjing]]'' ("mirror of rhymes") and ''[[Qiyin lüe]]'' ("summary of the seven sounds"), which are very similar, and believed to derive from a common prototype.  Earlier fragmentary documents describing the analysis have been found at [[Dunhuang]], suggesting that the tradition may date back to the late [[Tang dynasty]].

Some scholars use the French spelling "rime", as used by the Swedish linguist [[Bernhard Karlgren]], for the categories described in these works, to distinguish them from the concept of poetic rhyme.{{sfnp|Branner|2006|p=2}}

==History==
The ''[[Qieyun]]'', produced by Lù Fǎyán (陸法言) in 601, was a [[rime dictionary]], serving as a guide to the recitation of literary texts and an aid in the composition of verse.
It quickly became popular during the [[Tang dynasty]], leading to a series of revised and expanded editions, the most important of which was the ''[[Guangyun]]'' (1008).
In these dictionaries, characters were grouped first by the [[four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]], and then into rhyme groups.
Each rhyme group was subdivided into groups of homophonous characters, with the pronunciation of each given by a ''[[fanqie]]'' formula, a pair of familiar characters indicating the sounds of the initial and final parts of a syllable respectively.  The dictionaries typically used several characters for each initial or final.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=24–25}}

The fanqie method of indicating pronunciation made the dictionaries awkward to use.
The ''děngyùnxué'' (等韻學 "study of classified rhymes") was a more sophisticated analysis of the ''Qieyun'' pronunciations, initially developed by Chinese Buddhist monks who were studying [[Vyākaraṇa|Indian linguistics]].
A tantalizing glimpse of this tradition is offered by fragments from [[Dunhuang]].
A fragment held by the [[British Library]] (Or.8210/S.512) simply lists 30 initial consonants.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1970|pp=206–207}}
Another document includes three fragments attributed to a monk called Shǒuwēn (守温), who may have lived as early as the 9th century.
These fragments do not contain tables, but describe the phonological analysis that underlies them.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=28–29}}

The oldest known rhyme tables are a version of the ''[[Yunjing]]'' published with prefaces dated 1161 and 1203, and the ''[[Qiyin lüe]]'', which was included in the 1161 encyclopedia ''[[Tongzhi (book)|Tongzhi]]''.
The two are very similar, and are believed to be derived from a single version pre-dating the [[Song dynasty]].{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=41–42}}
The tables were accompanied by a body of teachings known as ''mēnfǎ'' (門法 "school precepts"), including rules for placing fanqie spellings that did not conform to the system within the tables.{{sfnp|Coblin|2006a|pp=114–115}}

Later rhyme tables were more elaborate.
The ''Sìshēng děngzǐ'' (四聲等子) was probably created during the Northern Song, and explicitly introduced broad rhyme classes (''shè'' 攝), which were previously implicit in the ordering of the tables.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1970|pp=206–207}}
The preface of the ''Qièyùn zhĭzhǎngtú'' (切韻指掌圖) is dated 1203, in the Southern Song.{{sfnp|Coblin|2006b|p=125}}
In this work the tables are restructured with separate columns for each of the 36 initials.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=43}}
The ''Jīng shǐ zhèng yīn Qièyùn zhǐnán'' (經史正音切韻指南), produced by Liú Jiàn (劉鑑) in 1336, was the basis for one of the two sets of rime tables at the front of the [[Kangxi dictionary]].{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1970|pp=206–207}}

The ''Yunjing'' was lost in China for several centuries.
The ''Qieyun zhizhangtu'', incorrectly attributed to the 11th century scholar [[Sima Guang]], was believed to be the oldest of the rime tables, and was used in the earliest reconstruction efforts.
However, in the 1880s several versions of the ''Yunjing'' were discovered in Japan.
Comparison with the ''Qiyin lüe'' showed that they were based on a common model, of which the other rime tables were later refinements.
All recent reconstruction work has been based on the ''Yunjing''.
The ''Fù Sòng Yǒnglù'' (覆宋永禄) edition of 1564 is considered the most reliable, and is the basis of all reproductions in circulation.{{efn|This edition is so named because it was published in the [[Eiroku]] (永禄) era, pronounced in Chinese as Yǒnglù.}}{{sfnp|Coblin|2006b|pp=123–124}}

==Structure==
{{See also|Chinese historical phonology}}

In the medieval rime dictionaries, characters were organized into rhyme groups (''yùn'' 韵), with 193 groups in the ''Qieyun'', growing to 206 in the ''Guangyun''.
The order of the rhyme groups within each tone implies a correspondence between rhyme groups across the [[four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]].
Thus for each rhyme group with an -m, -n or -ng coda in the level tone there are typically corresponding rhyme groups with the same coda in the rising and departing tones, and a corresponding rhyme group in the [[entering tone]] with a -p, -t or -k coda respectively.{{efn|These tones differ from the [[four tones]] of [[Modern Standard Chinese]], though related tone systems are retained by many southern languages.}}
In contrast, syllables with vocalic codas typically had corresponding rhyme groups only in the level, rising and departing tones.
There were also four departing tone rhyme groups with -j codas that had no counterparts in the other tones.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=33–35}}

The rime tables were solely concerned with the pronunciation of syllables of these rime dictionaries, and do not contain dictionary-like material such as definitions.
Similarly, where a group of characters are recorded as [[homophone]]s in the rime dictionaries, typically only one will occur in a rime table.{{sfnp|Branner|2006|p=3}}
A rime table book presents these distinct syllables in a number of tabular charts, each devoted to one or more sets of parallel rhyme groups across the tones.

The preface to ''Qieyun'' indicates that it represented a compromise between northern and southern reading pronunciations from the late [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] period.{{efn|For translations of the ''Qieyun'' preface, see {{harvtxt|Baxter|1992}}, pp. 35–36 and {{harvtxt|Ramsey|1989}}, pp. 116–117.}}
Most linguists now believe that no single dialect contained all the distinctions it recorded, but that each distinction did occur somewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Norman|1988}}, pp. 24–25; {{harvtxt|Baxter|1992}}, pp. 35–38.&lt;/ref&gt;
The rime tables were compiled centuries later in the time of a new standard, and many of the distinctions in the ''Qieyun'' would have been meaningless to the compilers.
[[Edwin Pulleyblank]] has argued that the tables contain enough evidence to reconstruct the speech of that later period.  He calls this language Late Middle Chinese (LMC) in contrast to the Early Middle Chinese of the ''Qieyun'', and argues that it was the standard speech of the imperial capital [[Chang'an]] in the late [[Tang dynasty]].  His reconstruction accounts for most of the distinctions in modern varieties of Chinese (except [[Min Chinese|Min]]), as well as layers of Chinese loanwords, such as the [[Kan-on]] layer of [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pulleyblank|1970}}; {{harvtxt|Pulleyblank|1971}}; {{harvtxt|Pulleyblank|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tables ===
Each chart of the ''Yunjing'' is labelled as either "open" (''kāi'' 開) or "closed" (''hé'' 合).
The corresponding terms in the ''Qiyin lüe'' are "heavy" (''zhòng'' 重) and "light" (''qīng'' 輕).{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1984|p=73}}
The open/closed distinction is interpreted to indicate the absence or presence of lip rounding (often transcribed as -w- or -u-).
Some ''Guangyun'' rhyme groups include syllables of both kinds, and thus span two charts, while others are purely "open" or "closed", and thus fit within one chart.
Charts are grouped together in broad rhyme classes (''shè'' {{lang|zh-Hant|攝}}), each characterized as either "inner" (''nèi'' {{lang|zh-Hant|內}}) or "outer" (''wài'' {{lang|zh-Hant|外}}), thought to be related to vowel heights, contrasting [[close vowel]]s and [[open vowel]]s respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Norman|1988}}, pp. 31–32; {{harvtxt|Baxter|1992}}, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the first of the 43 charts of the ''Yùnjìng'' is shown below (the Arabic numerals are modern annotations):

[[File:yunjing.jpg|700px|center]]

The five big characters on the right-hand side read ''Nèi zhuǎn dìyī kāi'' (內轉第一開). In the ''Yùnjìng'', each chart is called a ''zhuǎn'' (lit. "turn"). The characters indicate that the chart is the first (第一) one in the book, and that the syllables of this chart are "inner" (內) and "open" (開).

The columns of each table classify syllables according to their initial consonant (''shēngmǔ'' 聲母 lit. "sound mother"), with syllables beginning with a [[vowel]] considered to have a "zero initial".  Initials are classified according to
* [[place of articulation]]: [[Labial consonant|labials]] (''chún'' 脣 "lip"), [[Alveolar consonant|alveolars]] (''shé'' 舌 "tongue"), [[Velar consonant|velars]] (''yá'' 牙 "back tooth"), [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] and [[Sibilant consonant|sibilants]] (''chǐ'' 齒 "front tooth"), and laryngeals (''hóu'' 喉 "throat").  The values of the last category remain controversial.
* [[manner of articulation]]: voiceless (''qīng'' 清 "clear"), voiceless aspirated (''cìqīng'' 次清 "secondary clear"), voiced (''zhuó'' 濁 "muddy") or [[Nasal stop|nasal]] or [[Liquid consonant|liquid]] (''qīngzhuó'' 清濁 "clear muddy").{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=30–31}}
The order of the places and manners roughly match that of [[Sanskrit]], providing further evidence of inspiration from Indian phonology.{{sfnp|Branner|2006|pp=9–10}}

Each table had 16 rows, with a group of four rows for each of the four tones of the ''[[Qieyun]]''.
The above chart covers four parallel ''Guangyun'' rhyme groups, the level-toned 東 ''dōng'', the rising-toned 董 ''dǒng'', the departing-toned 送 ''sòng'', and the entering-toned 屋 ''wū'' (which in Middle Chinese ended in -k, the entering tone counterpart of -ng).

Within each tone group are four rows known as ''děng'' (等 "class", "grade" or "group"), which [[Bernhard Karlgren]] translated as "divisions" while other linguists prefer "grades".
They are usually denoted by Roman numerals I to IV.
Their meaning remains the most controversial aspect of rime table phonology, but is believed to indicate [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] (transcribed as the presence or absence of -j- or -i-), [[Retroflex consonant|retroflex]] features, [[phonation]], vowel quality (high vs. low or front vs. back) or some combination of these.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=31–32}}
Other scholars view them not as phonetic categories but formal devices exploiting distributional patterns in the ''Qieyun'' to achieve a compact presentation.{{sfnp|Branner|2006|pp=15, 32–34}}

The symbol &lt;big&gt;○&lt;/big&gt; indicates that that particular syllable does not occur.

[[File:Qieyun Zhizhangtu table 02.png|700px|thumb|center|Table 2 of the ''Qieyun zhizhangtu'', a merger of the first two tables (東 ''dōng'' and 冬 ''dōng'' rhymes) of the ''Yunjing'']]

=== Organization ===
[[Bernard Karlgren]] noticed that classes of finals from the rime dictionaries were placed in different rows of the rime tables.
As three classes of final occurred in the first, second and fourth rows respectively, he named them finals of divisions I, II and IV.
The remaining finals he called "division-III finals" because they occurred in the third row of the tables.
Some of these (the "pure" division-III finals) occurred only in that row, while others (the "mixed" finals) could also occur in the second or fourth rows with some initials.{{sfnp|Branner|2006|p=24}}

Later workers noted that in the so-called ''[[chongniu]]'' rhyme groups, 支 ''zhī'', 脂 ''zhī'', 祭 ''jì'', 宵 ''xiāo'', 鹽 ''yán'', 侵 ''qīn'', 仙 ''xiān'' and 真 ''zhēn'', a consistent distinction within each rhyme group in the rime books is reflected in the rime tables by dividing the rhyme group between rows III and IV, often in adjacent tables.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=75}}
[[Li Rong (linguist)|Li Rong]], in a systematic comparison of the rhyme tables with a recently discovered early edition of the ''Qieyun'', identified seven classes of finals.
The table below lists the combinations of initial and final classes that occur in the ''Qieyun'', with the row of the rime tables in which each combination was placed:{{sfnp|Branner|2006|p=25}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=63–81}}

In addition, division-II and division-IV finals occur only in "outer" ''shè''.

This distribution is the foundation of the compact tabular presentation of rime dictionary syllables.
For example, the dental and retroflex stop initials are combined in a single group in a rime table, with the rows distinguishing the different ''Qieyun'' initials, and the three groups of sibilant initials are similarly combined.
In a similar fashion different finals may occupy different rows of the same chart.{{sfnp|Branner|2006|pp=32–33}}

The ''Guangyun'' rhyme groups (here illustrated in the level tone, except where a group occurs only in the departing tone) are distributed across the 43 charts of the ''Yunjing'' and ''Qiyin lüe'' as follows:

In some cases, the ''Guangyun'' already reflected the open/closed distinction with separate rhyme groups, while in others they were included in the same group.

==Thirty-six initials{{anchor|36 initials}}==
The earliest documentary records of the rime table tradition, the Dunhuang fragments, contain lists of 30 initials, each named after an exemplary character.
This was later expanded to a standard set of 36 in the preface of the ''Yunjing'', the major addition being a series of [[labiodental]] fricatives split from the labial series:{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1970|pp=206–207}}

[[File:Yunjing - 36 initials.png|700px|center]]

Tables of the ''Yunjing'' have only 23 columns, with one group of columns each for labials, coronals and sibilants, with the different types placed in different rows of the tables.
Some later tables such as the ''Qieyun zhizhangtu'' have 36 columns, one for each of the 36 initials.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=43}}

The 36 initials were so influential that it was not until 1842 that it was discovered (by [[Chen Li (scholar)|Chen Li]]) that the initials of the ''Qieyun'' were slightly different.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=54}}

[[Image:Entrance_to_the_Shrine_of_the_Book.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Shrine of the Book]]
[[Image:Shrine_of_the_Book_2.jpg|thumb|The Shrine of the Book is built to symbolize the scroll of the [[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]] - The [[shrine]] is built as a white [[dome]] symbolizing the Sons of Light, and a black [[basalt]] wall - symbolizing the Sons of Darkness.]]

The '''Shrine of the Book''' ({{lang-he|היכל הספר}}, ''Heikhal HaSefer'') is a wing of the [[Israel Museum]] in the [[Givat Ram]] neighborhood of [[Jerusalem]] that houses the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

==History==
Initially, it was intended{{By whom|date=July 2018}} to build a home for the scrolls on the Givat Ram campus of the [[Hebrew University]], adjoining the [[Jewish National and University Library]]. The building was constructed in 1965, funded by the family of [[David Samuel Gottesman]], a Hungarian-Jewish philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/JerusalemReport/Article.aspx?id=176539 Israel's Treasure Trove, [[Jerusalem Post]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The building was designed by [[Armand Phillip Bartos]], [[Frederick John Kiesler]] and Gezer Heller over a period of seven years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archdaily.com/156442/AD Classics: Shrine of the Book / Armand Phillip Bartos and Frederick John Kiesler]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[shrine]] is built as a white [[dome]], covering a structure placed two-thirds below the ground, that is reflected in a pool of water that surrounds it. Across from the white dome is a black [[basalt]] wall. According to one interpretation, the colors and shapes of the building are based on the imagery of the Scroll of the [[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]; the white dome symbolizes the Sons of Light and the black wall symbolizes the Sons of Darkness&lt;ref name="Shrine of the Book, The Israel Museum, The Temple"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shrine of the Book, The Israel Museum, The Temple|url=http://allaboutjerusalem.com/gallery-image/sons-light-sons-darkness/214|publisher= All About Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the fragility of the scrolls makes it impossible to display all on a continuous basis, a system of rotation is used. After a scroll has been exhibited for 3–6 months, it is removed from its showcase and placed temporarily in a special storeroom, where it "rests" from exposure.

The shrine houses the [[Isaiah scroll]], dating from the second century BCE, the most intact of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the [[Aleppo Codex]], dating from the 10th century CE, the oldest existing Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/A-sound-in-silence A Sound in Silence, [[Jerusalem Post]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[Bank of Israel]] released an Israeli [[bullion coin]] dedicated to the Shrine of the Book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelmint.com/newsletters/bullion4 Shrine of the Book bullion coin]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[open nomenclature]] it indicates that available material or evidence suggests that the proposed [[species]] is ''related to'', has an ''[[Affinity (taxonomy)|affinity]]'' to, but is ''not identical to'', the species with the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] name that follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An author who inserts ''[[n.sp.]],'' or ''[[sp. nov.]], aff'' before a species name thereby states the opinion that the specimen is a new, previously [[Species description|undescribed]] species,&lt;ref name="Bengtson 1988"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bengtson|first=P.|title=Open Nomenclature|url=http://www.palass-pubs.org/palaeontology/pdf/Vol31/Pages%20223-227.pdf|work=Palentology|accessdate=2 April 2014|year=1988|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071437/http://www.palass-pubs.org/palaeontology/pdf/Vol31/Pages%20223-227.pdf|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that there may not (yet) be enough information to complete a formal description. To use aff. alone, implies that the specimen differs suggestively from the [[holotype]] but that further progress is necessary to confirm that it is a novel species.

An example would be: a [[gastropod shell]] listed as [[Lucapina aff. aegis|''Lucapina'' aff. ''aegis'']] would mean that this shell somewhat resembles the shell of ''[[Lucapina aegis]]'', but is thought more likely to be another species, either closely related to, or closely resembling ''Lucapina aegis''. In a suitable context it also may suggest the possibility that the shell belongs to a species that has not yet been [[Species description|described]].

The use of aff. is similar to other indicators of open nomenclature such as [[cf.]], [[Species|sp.]], or ?,&lt;ref name="Bengtson 1988"/&gt; but the latter indicate that the species is ''uncertain'' rather than undescribed.

{{Politics of India}}

[[India]] won independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] by the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]], ending the [[British Raj]].  This act, passed in June and receiving [[royal assent]] in July, took effect on 15 August 1947.

==Precursors==

===Clean Break speech===
Although the militant factions of the Independence movement were advocating a complete break from British rule for almost a century, the first call for a non-violent movement led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] was articulated in the aftermath of the failed [[Cripps' mission]] in April, 1942. Below is an excerpt of Gandhi's speech advocating complete independence from British rule.&lt;ref name ="INC_website"&gt;{{cite web | title = Congress &amp; The Freedom Movement | publisher = [[Indian National Congress]] | url = http://www.aicc.org.in/new/congress-the-freedom-movement.php | accessdate = 11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am convinced that the time has come for the British and the Indians to be reconciled to complete separation from each other. Complete and immediate orderly withdrawal of the British from India [...] will at once put the Allied cause on a completely moral basis.  [...]
I ask every Briton to support me in my appeal to the British at this hour to retire from every Asiatic and African possession. ... I ask for a bloodless end of an unnatural domination and for a new era. Leave India to God and if that be too much, leave her to anarchy, necessity for withdrawal lies in its being immediate."&lt;/blockquote&gt;   By Rahul Kumar

===Quit India Resolution===
One 8 August 1942, the [[All India Congress Committee]] met in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] and passed the Quit India Resolution. The outcome was a mass uprising all over India with mass [[boycott]]s and [[civil disobedience]], called the [[Quit India Movement]]

==Declaring the close of the Colonial era==
On 15 August 1947, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister of free India]], addressed the [[Constituent Assembly]].  In his famous speech, ''[[Tryst with Destiny]]'', he declared the end of the colonial era and called on citizens to recognize the promise and opportunity of the moment:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Long years ago, we made a tryst with destiny. Now the time has come when we shall redeem our pledge - not wholly or in full measure - but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His speech&lt;ref name="modern_history_Sourcebook"&gt;{{cite web | title = Jawaharlal Nehru (1889-1964): Speech On the Granting of Indian Independence, August 14, 1947 | work = Modern History Sourcebook | publisher = [[Fordham University]] |date = October 1998| url = http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1947nehru1.html | accessdate = 11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; went on to pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi's efforts in the Independence Movement and called upon his countrymen to work together to
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...bring freedom and opportunity to the common man, to the peasants and workers of India; to fight and end poverty and ignorance and disease; to build up a prosperous, democratic and progressive nation, and to create social, economic and political institutions which will ensure justice and fullness of life to every man and woman."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The declaration ends with an exhortation to work together in the [[common good|common weal]] and cautions against narrow [[sectarianism|sectarian]] or religious divisiveness: &lt;blockquote&gt;"All of us, to whatever religion we may belong, are equally the children of India with equal rights, privileges and obligations. We cannot encourage communalism or narrow-mindedness, for no nation can be great whose people are narrow in thought or in action."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The case overturned the [[Durham rule]] for determining whether a defendant was [[not guilty by reason of insanity]].The Court ruled that the primary reason they were departing from the old test of insanity is that it put substantial dominance on the testimony of experts. The Court exhaustively examined the justification for the defense of insanity and the need to guide the jury with a specific framework for the insanity defense. The [[American Law Institute]] provided a better framework in the majority’s opinion because it took part of the reliance on experts away and focused on the acts and mental state of a defendant at the time he committed the acts constituting the crime.&lt;ref name=IECJ&gt;Insanity, Encyclopedia of Crime and Justice 735-40 (1983); Abraham Goldstein&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]], {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|634}} It proposed a rule that was adopted as the American Law Institute Model Penal Code rule ([[ALI rule]]).&lt;ref name=IECJ/&gt;

An '''unsponsored top-level domain''' (uTLD) is one of the categories  of [[top-level domain]]s (TLDs) maintained by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) for use in the [[Domain Name System]] of the [[Internet]].  IANA currently distinguishes 3 groups of top-level domains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/ |title=Root Zone Database |publisher=Interxxx Assigned Numbers Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[country-code top-level domain]]s (ccTLD), [[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLD) and [[top-level domain#Infrastructure domain|infrastructure top-level 
domain]].

Unsponsored TLD is a specialized top-level domain that has no sponsor, in opposition of sTLD (sponsored), that has a sponsor representing a specific community served by the domain. Generally speaking, uTLD is a TLD without "owner", where [[ICANN]] has an important governance role.

It is a reduced set of TLDs: old ones (&lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.org&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.net&lt;/code&gt;) and new ones (&lt;code&gt;.biz&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.info&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.name&lt;/code&gt;).

'''''Uriaș''''' (plural ''uriași'') is the common [[Romanian language|Romanian-language]] designation of [[Giant (mythology)|giants]], who are prominent figures in [[Romanian folklore]]. There are several varieties of ''uriași'', who share most of their traits but have different names from one [[Historical regions of Romania|historical region]] of [[Romania]] to another. Thus, '''''Jidovi''''' is the term used mainly in [[Oltenia]], and its bearers are supposed to be creators of large mounds, and, in some legends, they play an evil role. '''''Novaci''''' is used mainly in [[Muntenia]], for creatures who are mainly associated with the [[Southern Carpathians]].

'''Walter Frederick Ferrier''' (1865–1950) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[geologist]] and [[mining engineer]].

He graduated from [[McGill University]]'s school of mining engineering. He was a tireless [[mineral collector]] and was known for walking straight into mining offices to request specimens. Consequently, he created large collections of mineral specimens of a quality still admired to this day. Many classic specimens would never be in collections had it not been for his effort and skill. 
The mineral specimens he amassed were instrumental in creating the mineral collections of the [[Smithsonian]] in Washington DC, the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] in [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, [[University of Alberta]], and the museum particularly dear to his heart, the [[Redpath Museum]] at McGill University in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.

During one of his collecting trips he noticed a bladed mineral enclosed in [[chalcedony]] on the edge of [[Kamloops Lake]] in the Kamloops Mining Division, [[British Columbia]], Canada. It turned out to be a new member of the [[Zeolite]] family of minerals. Subsequently, it was named after him - [[Ferrierite]]. The type material of this mineral is stored at the Redpath Museum and is part of a separate collection that also bears his name.

'''Willis Linn Jepson''' (August 19, 1867 in [[Little Oak Ranch]], near [[Vacaville, California]] – November 7, 1946 in [[Berkeley, California]]) is known as [[California]]'s most distinguished early [[botanist]]. He graduated from the [[University of California]] in 1889, and became a UC professor in botany, a botanical writer, and a conservationist.

==History==
Jepson became interested in [[botany]] as a boy and explored the adjacent [[San Francisco Bay Area]] regions.  He had come in contact with various botanists before he entered college.

In 1892, Jepson was 25 years old when he, [[John Muir]], and [[Warren Olney]] formed the [[Sierra Club]], in Olney's law office in San Francisco.

From 1895 to 1898 Jepson served as instructor, and carried on research at UC Berkeley, [[Cornell University|Cornell]] (1895) and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (1896–97). He received his Ph.D. degree at [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1899.

He was made assistant professor in 1899, associate professor in 1911, professor in 1918, and professor emeritus in 1937. He was a Professor of Botany at UC Berkeley for four decades, thus his entire career was identified with the University of California.

==Works==
Jepson wrote at least 11 books during his lifetime, with two focused on California's trees. His works include ''A Flora of California'' (1909), ''The Trees of California'' (1909); and the major ''A Manual of the Flowering Plants of California'' (1925), predecessor of [[The Jepson Manual]] (1993).

==Legacy==
His specimens, extensive archives and fieldbooks are housed in the [[University and Jepson Herbaria]] libraries and archives. Most of his specimens from California have been databased in the [[Jepson Manual Online|Jepson Online Interchange for California Floristics − Jepson eFlora (TJM2)]] and form a multi-institutional Consortium of California Herbaria database.

===Honors and achievements===
Many honors came to Willis Linn Jepson during his long and productive lifetime, and commemorations afterwards. They include:
* Founded the [[California Botanical Society]], and was president of it from 1913–15
* Fellow of the [[California Academy of Sciences]] (1918–29), [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], [[Royal Society of Arts]], and [[American Geographical Society]]
* Delegate to the International Agricultural Congress at Liége (1906), and to the [[International Botanical Congress]]es at Cambridge (1930) and Amsterdam (1935)
* Councilor of the [[Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden]]
* UC Berkeley colleagues honored him with the Faculty Research Lectureship in 1934
* Foreign member of the Société Linnéenne de Lyon and the National Botanical Society of Czechoslovakia
* Life member of the [[American Genetic Association]]; and member of the [[American Society of Plant Taxonomists]], [[Botanical Society of America]], Society of Foresters, Washington Academy of Sciences, [[Western Society of Naturalists]], [[Phi Beta Kappa]], and [[Sigma Xi]].
* The [[Saxifragaceae]] genus ''[[Jepsonia]]'', and host of plant species botanical and common names, are named after him in commemoration.
* The [[Jepson Herbarium]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] is named for him.
* ''[[The Jepson Manual]]: Higher Plants of California'' is named in his honor.
* Willis Jepson Middle School is named after him in [[Vacaville, California]].
