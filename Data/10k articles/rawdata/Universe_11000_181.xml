'''''A Cow at My Table''''' is a 1998 [[documentary film]] examining Western [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] towards farm animals and meat.

It covers the conflict between [[animal rights]] advocates and the [[meat industry]], and their respective attempts to influence consumers. It was directed, shot, and edited by [[Jennifer Abbott]], who spent five years travelling across Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand to interview representatives on all sides. The film intercuts these interviews with images of farm animals and industrial farming operations. It explores what is sometimes popularly called [[factory farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vegetarian fair offers fresh ideas and meaty moo-vie|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/427912491.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+08%2C+1999&amp;author=&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Vegetarian+fair+offers+fresh+ideas+and+meaty+moo-vie&amp;pqatl=google|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=September 8, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filming of ''A Cow at My Table'' drew early criticism from the Canadian meat industry, with both the Ontario Chicken Marketing Board and the [[Dairy Farmers of Ontario]] publishing articles warning of Abbott's actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strathdee|first=Mike|title=Farm groups shun filmmaker who faces charge of mischief|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/497844321.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+27%2C+1996&amp;author=Mike+Strathdee&amp;pub=Waterloo+Region+Record&amp;desc=Farm+groups+shun+filmmaker+who+faces+charge+of+mischief&amp;pqatl=google|newspaper=The Record|date=July 27, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1818">'''Alexander François Selligue''' (1784-1845) was a French engineer. In 1832, he together with David Blum patented an application of [[shale oil]] for direct illumination. In 1838, he patented "the employment of mineral oils for lighting". His process of distilling [[bituminous shale]]s ([[oil shale]]) was first described in the ''Journal des Connaissances Usuelles'' in 1834.&lt;ref name=silliman&gt;

'''Amber''' is [[fossil]]ized tree [[resin]], which has been appreciated for its color and natural beauty since [[Neolithic]] times.&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt; Much valued from antiquity to the present as a [[gemstone]], amber is made into a variety of decorative objects.&lt;ref name=Jersey&gt;"Amber" (2004). In Maxine N. Lurie and Marc Mappen (eds.) ''Encyclopedia of New Jersey'', Rutgers University Press, {{ISBN|0813533252}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Amber is used in [[jewelry]]. It has also been used as a healing agent in folk medicine.

There are five classes of amber, defined on the basis of their chemical constituents. Because it originates as a soft, sticky tree resin, amber sometimes contains animal and plant material as [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20161208"&gt;{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas |title=That Thing With Feathers Trapped in Amber?

(1995) ''The quest for life in amber''. Basic Books, {{ISBN|0-201-48928-7}}, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The English word ''amber'' derives from [[Arabic]]  {{lang|ar-Latn|ʿanbar}} {{lang|ar|عنبر|rtl=yes}}&lt;ref name=etym/&gt; (cognate with [[Middle Persian]] ''ambar''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbinics.org/pahlavi/MacKenzie-PahlDict.pdf A Concise Pahlavi Dictionary, D N MacKenzie, Oxford University Press, 1971] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203034323/http://www.rabbinics.org/pahlavi/MacKenzie-PahlDict.pdf |date=3 December 2012 }}, {{ISBN|0 19 713559 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) via [[Middle Latin]] ''ambar'' and [[Middle French]] ''ambre''. The word was adopted in [[Middle English]] in the 14th century as referring to what is now known as ''[[ambergris]]'' (''ambre gris'' or "grey amber"), a solid waxy substance derived from the [[sperm whale]]. 
In the [[Romance languages]], the sense of the word had come to be extended to Baltic amber (fossil resin) from as early as the late 13th century. At first called white or yellow amber (''ambre jaune''), this meaning was adopted in English by the early 15th century. As the use of ambergris waned, this became the main sense of the word.&lt;ref name=etym&gt;{{OEtymD|amber}} and {{OED|amber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two substances ("yellow amber" and "grey amber") conceivably became associated or confused because they both were found washed up on beaches. Ambergris is less dense than water and floats, whereas amber is too dense to float, though less dense than stone.&lt;ref&gt;see: Abu Zaid al Hassan from Siraf &amp; Sulaiman the Merchant (851), ''Silsilat-al-Tawarikh (travels in Asia)''.{{clarify|date=September 2013}}&lt;!--"see" this for what? what is this substantiating?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The classical names for amber, [[Latin]] ''electrum'' and [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἤλεκτρον#Ancient Greek|ἤλεκτρον]]}}  (''ēlektron''), are connected to a term ἠλέκτωρ (''ēlektōr'') meaning "beaming [[Sun]]".&lt;ref name=King1&gt;
[[Homeric Greek|Homeric]] ([[Iliad]] 6.513, 19.398). The feminine {{lang|grc|ἠλεκτρίς}} being later used as a name of the [[Moon]].

Collings, ''Gemlore: An Introduction to Precious and Semi-Precious Stones'', 2009, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''elektron'' gave rise to the words ''electric, electricity'', and their relatives because of amber's ability to bear a [[static electricity]] charge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/electric "Electric."

==History== 
[[Theophrastus]] discussed amber in the 4th century BC, as did [[Pytheas]] (c. 330 BC), whose work "On the Ocean" is lost, but was referenced by [[Pliny the Elder]] (23 to 79 AD), according to whose ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|The Natural History]]'' (in what is also the earliest known mention of the name ''[[Germania]]''):&lt;ref name="pliny37-11"&gt;''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D37%3Achapter%3D11 37.11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924171950/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D37%3Achapter%3D11 |date=24 September 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Pytheas says that the [[Gutones]], a people of Germany, inhabit the shores of an estuary of the Ocean called Mentonomon, their territory extending a distance of six thousand stadia; that, at one day's sail from this territory, is the Isle of [[Abalus]], upon the shores of which, amber is thrown up by the waves in spring, it being an excretion of the sea in a concrete form; as, also, that the inhabitants use this amber by way of fuel, and sell it to their neighbors, the [[Teutones]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Earlier&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137;query=chapter%3D%23172;layout=;loc=4.26 IV.27.13] or IV.13.95 in the Loeb edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny says that Pytheas refers to a large island - three days' sail from the [[Scythia]]n coast and called [[Baltia|Balcia]] by [[Xenophon of Lampsacus]] (author of a fanciful travel book in Greek) - as ''Basilia'' - a name generally equated with ''Abalus''. Given the presence of amber, the island could have been [[Heligoland]], [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], the shores of [[Bay of Gdansk]], the [[Sambia Peninsula]] or the [[Curonian Lagoon]], which were historically the richest sources of amber in northern Europe.{{cn|date=December 2018}}
It is assumed{{by whom|date=March 2018}} that there were well-established trade routes for amber connecting the Baltic with the Mediterranean (known as the "[[Amber Road]]"). Pliny states explicitly that the Germans exported amber to [[Pannonia]], from where the [[Adriatic Veneti|Veneti]] distributed it onwards.

The ancient Italic peoples of southern Italy used to work amber; the National Archaeological Museum of Siritide (Museo Archeologico Nazionale della Siritide) at [[Policoro]] in the [[province of Matera]] ([[Basilicata]]) displays important surviving examples.
Amber used in antiquity as at [[Mycenae]] and in the prehistory of the Mediterranean comes from deposits of [[Sicily]].{{cn|date=December 2018}}

Pliny also cites the opinion of [[Nicias]] ({{circa}} 470–413 BC), according to whom amber&lt;blockquote&gt;is a liquid produced by the rays of the sun; and that these rays, at the moment of the sun's setting, striking with the greatest force upon the surface of the soil, leave upon it an unctuous sweat, which is carried off by the tides of the Ocean, and thrown up upon the shores of Germany.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Besides the fanciful explanations according to which amber is "produced by the Sun", Pliny cites opinions that are well aware of its origin in tree resin, citing the native Latin name of ''succinum'' (''sūcinum'', from ''sucus'' "juice").&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[succinic acid]] as well as ''succinite'', a term given to a particular type of amber by [[James Dwight Dana]]&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Amber is produced from a marrow discharged by trees belonging to the pine genus, like gum from the cherry, and resin from the ordinary pine. It is a liquid at first, which issues forth in considerable quantities, and is gradually hardened [...] Our forefathers, too, were of opinion that it is the juice of a tree, and for this reason gave it the name of "succinum" and one great proof that it is the produce of a tree of the pine genus, is the fact that it emits a pine-like smell when rubbed, and that it burns, when ignited, with the odour and appearance of torch-pine wood.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

He also states that amber is also found in Egypt and in India, and he even refers to the [[electrostatic]] properties of amber, by saying that "in Syria the women make the [[spindle whorl|whorl]]s of their spindles of this substance, and give it the name of ''harpax'' [from ἁρπάζω, "to drag"] from the circumstance that it attracts leaves towards it, chaff, and the light fringe of tissues".

Pliny says that the German name of amber was ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/glasą#Proto-Germanic|glæsum]]'', "for which reason the Romans, when [[Germanicus Caesar]] commanded the fleet in those parts, gave to one of these islands the name of Glæsaria, which by the barbarians was known as Austeravia". This is confirmed by the recorded [[Old High German]] word ''glas'' and by the [[Old English]] word ''[[:wikt:glær#Old English|glær]]'' for "amber" (compare ''[[wikt:glass|glass]]'').
In [[Middle Low German]], amber was known as ''berne-, barn-, börnstēn'' (with etymological roots related to "burn" and to "stone"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Bernstein|title=Bernstein - Wiktionary|author=|date=|website=en.wiktionary.org|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326142339/https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Bernstein|archivedate=26 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The Low German term became dominant also in [[High German]] by the 18th century, thus modern German ''Bernstein'' besides [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''barnsteen''.

Early in the nineteenth century, the first reports of amber found in North America came from discoveries in [[New Jersey]] along [[Crosswicks Creek]] near [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], at [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], and near [[Woodbury, New Jersey|Woodbury]].&lt;ref name=Jersey/&gt;

==Composition and formation==
Amber is [[heterogeneous]] in composition, but consists of several [[resin]]ous bodies more or less soluble in [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[chloroform]], associated with an insoluble [[Bitumen|bituminous]] substance. Amber is a [[macromolecule]] by free [[radical polymerization]] of several precursors in the [[labdane]] family, e.g. [[communic acid]], [[cummunol]], and [[biformene]].{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=792}}&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Villanueva-García, Antonio Martínez-Richa, and Juvencio Robles [http://www.arkat-usa.org/ark/journal/2005/I06_Juaristi/1567/EJ-1567C.asp Assignment of vibrational spectra of labdatriene derivatives and ambers: A combined experimental and density functional theoretical study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060412074659/http://www.arkat-usa.org/ark/journal/2005/I06_Juaristi/1567/EJ-1567C.asp |date=12 April 2006 }} [[Arkivoc]] (EJ-1567C) pp. 449–458&lt;/ref&gt; These labdanes are [[diterpene]]s (C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;) and trienes, equipping the organic skeleton with three [[alkene]] groups for [[polymerization]]. As amber matures over the years, more polymerization takes place as well as [[isomerization]] reactions, [[Cross-link|crosslinking]] and [[cyclization]].

Heated above {{convert|200|C}}, amber decomposes, yielding an '''oil of amber''', and leaves a black residue which is known as "amber colophony", or "amber pitch"; when dissolved in oil of [[turpentine]] or in [[linseed oil]] this forms "amber varnish" or "amber lac".{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=792}}

===Formation===
Molecular polymerization, resulting from high pressures and temperatures produced by overlying sediment, transforms the resin first into [[copal]]. Sustained heat and pressure drives off [[terpene]]s and results in the formation of amber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Patty C.|last=Rice|title=Amber: Golden Gem of the Ages. 4th Ed.|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2006|isbn=1-4259-3849-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this to happen, the resin must be resistant to decay. Many trees produce resin, but in the majority of cases this deposit is broken down by physical and biological processes. Exposure to sunlight, rain, microorganisms (such as [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]), and extreme temperatures tends to disintegrate the resin. For the resin to survive long enough to become amber, it must be resistant to such forces or be produced under conditions that exclude them.&lt;ref&gt;Poinar, George O. (1992) ''Life in amber''.

===Botanical origin===
[[File:Bernstein Bitterfeld, Gedanit, Bruchstücke 5658.jpg|thumb|250px|Amber from Bitterfeld]]
Fossil resins from Europe fall into two categories, the famous Baltic ambers and another that resembles the ''[[Agathis]]'' group.

===Inclusions===
[[File:Baltic-amber-fossils-inclusions.jpg|thumb|Baltic amber with inclusions]]
The abnormal development of resin in living trees (''succinosis'') can result in the formation of amber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sherborn|first1=Charles Davies|title=Natural Science: A Monthly Review of Scientific Progress, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uCzPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA379&amp;lpg=PA379&amp;dq=succinosis&amp;ots=WAo8N5bpyg&amp;sig=NrKYaFZJdOOfBG1niEAQsXYLTqw&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2w6nXprrMAhVT42MKHWCwDQsQ6AEINTAG&amp;q=succinosis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impurities are quite often present, especially when the resin dropped onto the ground, so the material may be useless except for varnish-making. Such impure amber is called ''firniss''.

Such [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusion]] of other substances can cause amber to have an unexpected color. [[Pyrites]] may give a bluish color.  ''Bony amber'' owes its cloudy opacity to numerous tiny bubbles inside the resin.{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=793}} However, so-called ''black amber'' is really only a kind of [[Jet (lignite)|jet]].

In darkly clouded and even opaque amber, inclusions can be imaged using high-energy, high-contrast, high-resolution [[X-ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7324564.stm |title=BBC News, " Secret 'dino bugs' revealed", 1 April 2008 |publisher=BBC News |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=30 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100828135744/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7324564.stm| archivedate= 28 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraction and processing==

=== Distribution and mining ===
[[File:Baltic-amber-deposit-Yantarny.jpg|thumb|Amber mine "Primorskoje" in Jantarny, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia]]

Amber is globally distributed, mainly in rocks of Cretaceous age or younger.
Historically, the [[Sambia Peninsula|Samland]] coast west of [[Königsberg]] in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] was the world's leading source of amber. The first mentions of amber deposits here date back to the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://leta.st/blog/2016/07/history-of-russian-amber-1/ "The History of Russian Amber, Part 1: The Beginning"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315013751/https://leta.st/blog/2016/07/history-of-russian-amber-1/ |date=15 March 2018 }}, Leta.st&lt;/ref&gt; About 90% of the world's extractable amber is still located in that area, which became the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] of Russia in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gurukul.ucc.american.edu/ted/amber.htm Amber Trade and the Environment in the Kaliningrad Oblast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706182814/http://gurukul.ucc.american.edu/ted/amber.htm |date=6 July 2012 }}. Gurukul.ucc.american.edu. Retrieved on 19 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pieces of amber torn from the seafloor are cast up by the waves, and collected by hand, dredging, or diving. Elsewhere, amber is mined, both in open works and underground galleries. Then nodules of ''blue earth'' have to be removed and an opaque crust must be cleaned off, which can be done in revolving barrels containing sand and water. Erosion removes this crust from sea-worn amber.{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=793}}

[[File:Ambre bleu dominicain 21207.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blue amber]] from Dominican Republic]]
[[Caribbean amber]], especially [[Dominican amber|Dominican]] [[blue amber]], is mined through [[bell pit]]ting, which is dangerous due to the risk of tunnel collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Wichard, Wilfred and Weitschat, Wolfgang (2004) Im Bernsteinwald. – Gerstenberg Verlag, Hildesheim, {{ISBN|3-8067-2551-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
The Vienna amber factories, which use pale amber to manufacture pipes and other smoking tools, turn it on a [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]] and polish it with whitening and water or with [[rotten stone]] and oil. The final luster is given by friction with flannel.{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=793}}

When gradually heated in an oil-bath, amber becomes soft and flexible. Two pieces of amber may be united by smearing the surfaces with [[linseed oil]], heating them, and then pressing them together while hot. Cloudy amber may be clarified in an oil-bath, as the oil fills the numerous pores to which the turbidity is due. 

Small fragments, formerly thrown away or used only for varnish, are now used on a large scale in the formation of "ambroid" or "pressed amber".{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=793}} The pieces are carefully heated with exclusion of air and then compressed into a uniform mass by intense hydraulic pressure, the softened amber being forced through holes in a metal plate. The product is extensively used for the production of cheap jewelry and articles for smoking. This pressed amber yields brilliant interference colors in polarized light.

Amber has often been imitated by other resins like [[copal]] and [[kauri gum]], as well as by [[celluloid]] and even [[glass]]. Baltic amber is sometimes colored artificially, but also called "true amber".{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=793}}

== Appearance ==
Amber occurs in a range of different colors. As well as the usual yellow-orange-brown that is associated with the color "amber", amber itself can range from a whitish color through a pale lemon yellow, to brown and almost black. Other uncommon colors include red amber (sometimes known as "cherry amber"), green amber, and even [[blue amber]], which is rare and highly sought after.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gemselect.com/gem-info/amber/amber-gemstone-information-and-education.php|title=Amber: Natural Organic Amber Gemstone &amp; Jewelry Information; GemSelect|website=www.gemselect.com|access-date=2017-08-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828193355/https://www.gemselect.com/gem-info/amber/amber-gemstone-information-and-education.php|archivedate=28 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yellow amber is a hard fossil resin from evergreen trees, and despite the name it can be translucent, yellow, orange, or brown colored. Known to the Iranians by the Pahlavi compound word kah-ruba (from kah "straw" plus rubay "attract, snatch", referring to its electrical properties), which entered Arabic as kahraba' or kahraba (which later became the Arabic word for [[electricity]], كهرباء ''kahrabā&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''), it too was called amber in Europe (Old French and Middle English ambre). Found along the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, yellow amber reached the Middle East and western Europe via trade. Its coastal acquisition may have been one reason yellow amber came to be designated by the same term as ambergris. Moreover, like ambergris, the resin could be burned as an incense. The resin's most popular use was, however, for ornamentation—easily cut and polished, it could be transformed into beautiful jewelry.
Much of the most highly prized amber is transparent, in contrast to the very common cloudy amber and opaque amber. Opaque amber contains numerous minute bubbles. This kind of amber is known as "bony amber".&lt;ref&gt;"Amber". (1999). In G. W. Bowersock, Peter Brown, Oleg Grabar (eds.) ''Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World'', Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|0674511735}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although all [[Dominican amber]] is fluorescent, the rarest Dominican amber is blue amber. It turns blue in natural sunlight and any other partially or wholly [[ultraviolet]] light source. In long-wave UV light it has a very strong reflection, almost white. Only about {{convert|100|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} is found per year, which makes it valuable and expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Manuel A. Iturralde-Vennet |year=2001 |title=Geology of the Amber-Bearing Deposits of the Greater Antilles |journal=Caribbean Journal of Science |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=141–167 |url=http://academic.uprm.edu/publications/cjs/Vol37b/37_141-167.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511133007/http://academic.uprm.edu/publications/cjs/Vol37b/37_141-167.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes amber retains the form of drops and [[stalactite]]s, just as it exuded from the ducts and receptacles of the injured trees.{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=793}} It is thought that, in addition to exuding onto the surface of the tree, amber resin also originally flowed into hollow cavities or cracks within trees, thereby leading to the development of large lumps of amber of irregular form.

==Classification==
Amber can be classified into several forms. Most fundamentally, there are two types of plant resin with the potential for fossilization. [[Terpenoid]]s, produced by [[conifers]] and [[angiosperms]], consist of ring structures formed of [[isoprene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) units.&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt; [[Phenolic resin]]s are today only produced by [[angiosperms]], and tend to serve functional uses. The extinct [[Medullosales|medullosan]]s produced a third type of resin, which is often found as amber within their veins.&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt; The composition of resins is highly variable; each species produces a unique blend of chemicals which can be identified by the use of [[pyrolysis]]–[[gas chromatography]]–[[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt; The overall chemical and structural composition is used to divide ambers into five classes.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0146-6380(92)90051-X|title=The nature and fate of natural resins in the geosphere—II. Identification, classification and nomenclature of resinites|year=1992|last1=Anderson|first1=K|last2=Winans|first2=R|last3=Botto|first3=R|journal=Organic Geochemistry|volume=18|issue=6|pages=829–841}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson1992iii/&gt; There is also a separate classification of amber gemstones, according to the way of production.

===Class I===
This class is by far the most abundant. It comprises labdatriene carboxylic acids such as communic or [[ozic acid]]s.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt; It is further split into three sub-classes. Classes Ia and Ib utilize regular labdanoid diterpenes (e.g. communic acid, communol, biformenes), while Ic uses ''enantio'' labdanoids (ozic acid, ozol, ''enantio'' biformenes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1021/bk-1995-0617.ch006|title=Amber, Resinite, and Fossil Resins|year=1996|last1=Anderson|first1=Ken B.|volume=617|pages=105–129|chapter=New Evidence Concerning the Structure, Composition, and Maturation of Class I (Polylabdanoid) Resinites|series=ACS Symposium Series|isbn=0-8412-3336-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ia====
Class Ia includes ''Succinite'' (= 'normal' Baltic amber) and ''Glessite''.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992iii/&gt; They have a communic acid base, and they also include much succinic acid.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt;

[[Baltic amber]] yields on dry distillation succinic acid, the proportion varying from about 3% to 8%, and being greatest in the pale opaque or ''bony'' varieties. The aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid. Baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid, hence the name ''succinite''. Succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3, which is rather greater than that of many other fossil resins. Its specific gravity varies from 1.05 to 1.10.{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=792}} It can be distinguished from other ambers via [[IR spectroscopy]] due to a specific [[carbonyl]] absorption peak. IR spectroscopy can detect the relative age of an amber sample. Succinic acid may not be an original component of amber, but rather a degradation product of [[abietic acid]].&lt;ref name=Rottlaender1970&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natmus.dk/cons/reports/2002/amber/amber.pdf |title=Degradation and inhibitive conservation of Baltic amber in museum collections |year=2007 |author=Shashoua, Yvonne |work=Department of Conservation, The National Museum of Denmark |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511212102/http://www.natmus.dk/cons/reports/2002/amber/amber.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ib====
Like class Ia ambers, these are based on communic acid; however, they lack [[succinic acid]].&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt;

====Ic====
This class is mainly based on ''enantio''-labdatrienonic acids, such as ozic and [[zanzibaric acid]]s.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt; Its most familiar representative is Dominican amber.&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt;

Dominican amber differentiates itself from [[Baltic amber]] by being mostly transparent and often containing a higher number of [[fossil]] inclusions. This has enabled the detailed reconstruction of the ecosystem of a long-vanished tropical forest.&lt;ref name=Poinar&gt;George Poinar, Jr. and Roberta Poinar, 1999. ''The Amber Forest: A Reconstruction of a Vanished World'', (Princeton University Press) {{ISBN|0-691-02888-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resin from the extinct species ''[[Hymenaea protera]]'' is the source of Dominican amber and probably of most amber found in the tropics. It is not "[[succinite]]" but "[[retinite]]".&lt;ref&gt;Grimaldi, D. A. (1996) Amber – Window to the Past. – American Museum of Natural History, New York, {{ISBN|0810919664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class II===
These ambers are formed from resins with a sesquiterpenoid base, such as [[cadinene]].&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt;

===Class III===
These ambers are [[polystyrenes]].&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt;

===Class IV===
Class IV is something of a wastebasket;{{clarify|date=April 2018}} its ambers are not polymerized, but mainly consist of [[cedrene]]-based sesquiterpenoids.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992ii/&gt;

===Class V===
Class V resins are considered to be produced by a pine or pine relative. They comprise a mixture of diterpinoid resins and ''n''-alkyl compounds. Their main variety is ''[[Copaline|Highgate copalite]]''.&lt;ref name=Anderson1992iii&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/0146-6380(93)90111-N|title=The nature and fate of natural resins in the geosphere—III.

Amber becomes abundant long after the Carboniferous, in the [[Early Cretaceous]], {{Ma|early cretaceous|round=-1}},&lt;ref name=Grimaldi2009/&gt; when it is found in association with [[Prehistoric insects|insects]]. The oldest amber with arthropod inclusions comes from the Levant, from Lebanon and Jordan. This amber, roughly 125–135 million years old, is considered of high scientific value, providing evidence of some of the oldest sampled [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name="PoinarOthers2011a"&gt;Poinar, P.O., Jr., and R.K. Milki (2001) ''Lebanese Amber: The Oldest Insect Ecosystem in Fossilized Resin.'' Oregon State University Press, Corvallis. {{ISBN|0-87071-533-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lebanon, more than 450 outcrops of Lower Cretaceous amber were discovered by Dany Azar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Azar|first=Dany|title=Lebanese amber: a "Guinness Book of Records"|journal=Annales Universitatis Paedagogicae Cracoviensis|year=2012|volume=111|pages=44–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a Lebanese paleontologist and entomologist. Among these outcrops, 20 have yielded biological inclusions comprising the oldest representatives of several recent families of terrestrial arthropods. Even older, [[Jurassic]] amber has been found recently in Lebanon as well. Many remarkable insects and spiders were recently discovered in the amber of Jordan including the oldest [[zoraptera]]ns, [[Cleridae|clerid beetles]], umenocoleid [[cockroach|roaches]], and achiliid [[planthopper]]s.&lt;ref name="PoinarOthers2011a"/&gt;

Baltic amber or succinite (historically documented as Prussian amber{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=792}}) is found as irregular [[Nodule (geology)|nodule]]s in marine [[Glauconite|glauconitic]] sand, known as ''blue earth'', occurring in the Lower [[Oligocene]] strata of [[Sambia Peninsula|Sambia]] in [[Prussia]] (in historical sources also referred to as ''Glaesaria'').{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=792}} After 1945, this territory around [[Königsberg]] was turned into [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], [[Russia]], where amber is now systematically mined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Jean|last=Langenheim|title=Plant Resins: Chemistry, Evolution, Ecology, and Ethnobotany|publisher=Timber Press Inc.|year=2003|isbn=0-88192-574-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears, however, to have been partly derived from older [[Eocene]] deposits and it occurs also as a derivative phase in later formations, such as [[glacial drift]]. Relics of an abundant flora occur as inclusions trapped within the amber while the resin was yet fresh, suggesting relations with the flora of Eastern [[Asia]] and the southern part of [[North America]]. [[Heinrich Göppert]] named the common amber-yielding pine of the Baltic forests ''Pinites succiniter'', but as the wood does not seem to differ from that of the existing genus it has been also called ''Pinus succinifera''. It is improbable, however, that the production of amber was limited to a single species; and indeed a large number of conifers belonging to different genera are represented in the amber-flora.{{sfn|Rudler|1911|p=793}}

===Paleontological significance===
Amber is a unique [[Fossilization|preservational mode]], preserving otherwise unfossilizable parts of organisms; as such it is helpful in the reconstruction of ecosystems as well as organisms;&lt;ref&gt;[http://db.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/amber.shtml BBC – Radio 4 – Amber] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212064001/http://db.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/amber.shtml |date=12 February 2006 }}.

The preservation of prehistoric organisms in amber forms a key plot point in [[Michael Crichton]]'s 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' and the [[Jurassic Park (film)|1993 movie adaptation]] by [[Steven Spielberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Making of Jurassic Park| author=Don Shay &amp; Jody Duncan| year=1993| p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the story, scientists are able to extract the preserved blood of [[dinosaurs]] from prehistoric [[mosquitoes]] trapped in amber, from which they genetically clone living dinosaurs.

===Scent of amber and amber perfumery===
[[File:Colar lituano com âmbar.JPG|thumb|Lithuanian amber jewelry]]

In [[ancient China]], it was customary to burn amber during large festivities. If amber is heated under the right conditions, [[oil of amber]] is produced, and in past times this was combined carefully with [[nitric acid]] to create "artificial musk" – a resin with a peculiar [[musk]]y odor.&lt;ref name="Amber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aphrodisiacs-info.com/amber.html|title=Amber as an aphrodisiac|website=Aphrodisiacs-info.com|accessdate=September 19, 2012|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130117090500/http://www.aphrodisiacs-info.com/amber.html|archivedate=January 17, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although when burned, amber does give off a characteristic "pinewood" fragrance, modern products, such as [[perfume]], do not normally use actual amber due to the fact that fossilized amber produces very little scent. In perfumery, scents referred to as “amber” are often created and patented&lt;ref&gt;Thermer, Ernst T.

The scent of amber was originally derived from emulating the scent of ambergris and/or the plant resin [[labdanum]], but due to the [[endangered species]] status of the sperm whale the scent of amber is now largely derived from labdanum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://teresacasimiro.com.sapo.pt/Bibliographic_References/21.pdf|title=Characterization of the Portuguese-Grown Cistus ladanifer Essential Oil|authors=Gomes, Paula B, Mata, Vera G, Rodrigues, A E|journal=Journal of Essential Oil Research|year=2005|doi=10.1080/10412905.2005.9698864|volume=17|issue=2|pages=160|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324060544/http://teresacasimiro.com.sapo.pt/Bibliographic_References/21.pdf|archivedate=24 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term “amber” is loosely used to describe a scent that is warm, musky, rich and honey-like, and also somewhat earthy. It can be synthetically created or derived from natural resins. When derived from natural resins it is most often created out of labdanum. [[Benzoin (organic compound)|Benzoin]] is usually part of the recipe. [[Vanilla]] and [[clove]]s are sometimes used to enhance the aroma.

"Amber" perfumes may be created using combinations of labdanum, [[benzoin resin]], [[copal]] (itself a type of tree resin used in incense manufacture), vanilla, [[Dammara resin]] and/or synthetic materials.&lt;ref name="Amber"/&gt;

=== Imitation made in natural resins ===

Young resins, these are used as imitations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Matushevskaya|2013|pp=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Kauri resin from ''[[Agathis australis]]'' trees in New Zealand.
* The [[copal]]s ([[subfossil]] resins). The African and American ([[Colombia]]) copals from ''[[Fabaceae|Leguminosae]]'' trees family (genus ''[[Hymenaea]]''). [[Dominican amber|Amber of the Dominican]] or Mexican type ([[#Class I|Class I]] of fossil resins). Copals from Manilia ([[Indonesia]]) and from New Zealand from trees of the genus ''[[Agathis]]'' (''[[Araucariaceae]]'' family)
* Other fossil resins: [[burmite]] in [[Burma]], [[rumenite]] in [[Romania]], simetite in [[Sicilia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1374">The '''anaerobic contact process''' is a type of [[anaerobic digester]]. Here a set of reactors are created in series, often with recycling. This recycled material is pumped up into the bottom of the first reactor, an upflow reactor. The upflow anaerobic process is a large reactor which allows the waste to flow up from the bottom and separates the waste into 3 zones. At the very top is the [[biogas]] zone where the gas is collected. Bacteria digest waste in the lowest portion of the upflow reactor; the [[bioreactor]] zone. In between these two stages is the clarifier zone where which exports the stabilised waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rpi.edu/dept/chem-eng/Biotech-Environ/Environmental/Sludge/digest.html |title=Anaerobic digesters |access-date=2006-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317232001/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/chem-eng/Biotech-Environ/Environmental/Sludge/digest.html |archive-date=2007-03-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Owen, William F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3068"> [[File:Bauschinger effect.svg|thumb|alt=Tensile-compressive asymmetry due to the Bauschinger effect|the Bauschinger effect.]]The '''Bauschinger effect''' refers to a property of materials where the material's stress/strain characteristics change as a result of the microscopic [[stress (physics)|stress]] distribution of the material. For example, an increase in tensile [[yield strength]] occurs at the expense of compressive [[yield strength]].  The effect is named after German engineer [[Johann Bauschinger]].

While more tensile cold working increases the tensile yield strength, the local initial compressive yield strength after tensile cold working is actually reduced. The greater the tensile cold working, the lower the compressive [[yield strength]].

The Bauschinger effect is normally associated with conditions where the yield strength of a metal decreases when the direction of strain is changed. It is a general phenomenon found in most [[polycrystalline]] metals.  The basic mechanism for the Bauschinger effect is related to the [[dislocation]] structure in the [[cold work]]ed metal. As deformation occurs, the [[dislocation]]s will accumulate at barriers and produce dislocation [[grain boundary strengthening|pile-up]]s and tangles. Based on the cold work structure, two types of mechanisms are generally used to explain the Bauschinger effect.

==Process of the Bauschinger effect==
# Local back stresses may be present if less than it would be if the strain had continued in the initial direction.
# Composite Mechanism

== Mechanism of action ==
Severe unidirectional cold working results in accumulation of dislocation at barriers to dislocation movement,  When stresses are applied in the reverse direction, the dislocations are now aided by the back stresses that were present at the dislocation barriers previously and also because the back stresses at the dislocation barriers in the back are not likely to be strong compared to the previous case. Hence the dislocations glide easily, resulting in lower yield stress for plastic deformation for reversed direction of loading.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mechanical Metallurgy|last = Dieter|first = George E.|publisher = McGraw Hill Book Company|year = 1988|isbn = 0-07-084187-X|location = |pages = 236,237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequence of Bauschinger effect ==
[[Metal forming]] operations  result in situations exposing the metal workpiece to stresses of reversed sign. The Bauschinger  effect contributes to work softening of the workpiece, for example in straightening of [[Bar drawing|drawn]]  bars or rolled sheets, where [[Rolling (metalworking)|rollers]] subject the workpiece to alternate bending stresses, thereby reducing the yield strength and enabling greater cold drawability of the workpiece.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4979">'''Bian stones''' are pointed stones that were historically used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. They are generally considered to be a precursor to [[acupuncture]], utilising heated pointed stones (instead of [[acupuncture]] needles) in the treatment of back and neck pain. The stones are made from a variety of materials found along the coastline of [[Shandong]], [[China]].

== History ==
Bian stone therapy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinesedrs.com/BianStone.html|title=Great Wall Chinese Medicine, Bian Stone|author=Great Wall Chinese Medicine|work=chinesedrs.com|accessdate=27 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604124814/http://www.chinesedrs.com/BianStone.html|archivedate=4 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of humanity's oldest medical practices. The Bian-stone technique refers to the use of stone-based equipment to perform massaging, heating and other operations. The devices are called bian stone tools. Bian-stone includes both the bian-stone technique and the tool. When used in medical institutions for therapeutic purposes, it is referred to as Bian-stone treatment.

Before [[acupuncture]] and [[moxibustion]] appeared, ancient Chinese people selected certain kinds of stone and ground it into a therapeutic tool that featured a sharp tip or an edge. Such shapes allowed the stone to be applied to the human body in different ways. The puncturing and pressing methods eventually evolved into acupuncture, while the heated-stone application evolved into moxibustion. A classic book notes that bian-stone treatment originated in the east of China, but moxibustion came from the North, where people had to warm themselves by fire.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/624373192|title=Chinese acupuncture and moxibustion|date=2010|publisher=Foreign Language Press|others=Cheng, Xinnong., Deng, Liangyue., 程莘农., 邓良月.|isbn=9787119059945|edition=3rd|location=Beijing|oclc=624373192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known by three names - Needle Stone, Arrow-headed Stone, and Bian Stone - these stones were used in primitive society as a special medicinal tool. Excavations of New Stone Age ruins in Asia recovered multiple Bian-stone needles of varying lengths from multiple locations. The recovered stone needles have different ends for different procedures, including blood-letting, qi (energy) regulation, and incising.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This technique disappeared during the [[Han Dynasty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-27682-8_93#page-1|title=Petrological and Mineralogical Studies of the Sibin Bian-Stone, a Material for Making Acupuncture Tools in Ancient China|work=springer.com|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the introduction and use of iron.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The source of the material for making Bian-stone has been identified as [[Sibin, Kale|Sibin]] floating stone. Bian stone appliances have since been devised and developed and therapeutic techniques explored.

Researchers have also investigated historical Chinese documents. Bian-stone is the first technique of the five major ancient medical practices of the “[[Yellow Emperor]]” (these five are: Bian-stone, Bian-stone tool, moxibustion, medicine, guided by Rocker).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Influence==
[[Image:Bian stone necklace.JPG|thumb|Bian stone necklace.]]
Bian stone has been applied in [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] for various soft tissue injuries, especially, [[cervical spondylosis]], [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] or [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[lower back pain]],&lt;ref name="Zeinemann Alternate Chinese Medicine" /&gt; as well as [[skin disorders]], such as abscesses or boils, and regulating qi and blood circulation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Clinical practice==
Therapy usually begins with a traditional Chinese massage to open up the body's meridians, followed by a series of Bian stone treatments with pre-heated bian stone. This therapy can be coupled with other traditional Chinese medicine therapy, such as acupuncture, or [[Fire cupping|cupping]] to achieve the optimal effect on [[cervical vertebra]]&lt;ref name="neck pain" /&gt; disease.

'''''Cereus repandus''''' (syn. '''''Cereus peruvianus'''''), the '''Peruvian apple cactus''', is a large, erect, thorny columnar [[cactus]] found in [[South America]] as well as the nearby [[ABC Islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC Islands]] of the [[Dutch Caribbean]]. It is also known as '''giant club cactus''', '''hedge cactus''', '''''cadushi''''' (in [[Wayuu language|Wayuunaiki]]&lt;ref name = villalobosetal2007&gt;Villalobos ''et al.'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;), and '''''kayush'''''.

With an often tree-like appearance, its cylindrical gray-green to blue stems can reach {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=off}} in height and 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter as a self-supporting plant. However, if supported by a scaffold, ''C.&amp;nbsp;repandus'' has grown to a height of {{convert|110|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} at the SDM College of Dental Sciences at Dharwad, [[Karnataka]], [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.worldrecordacademy.com/nature/tallest_homegrown_cactus_SDM_College_of_Dental_Sciences_breaks_Guinness_World_Records_record_215450.html | title= World Record Academy | date= 1 September 2015 | access-date= 26 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; technically making this the tallest cactus plant in the world, although no cactus under natural conditions exceeds {{convert|82|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} in height in the case of ''[[Cereus stenogonus|C.&amp;nbsp;stenogonus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan L. Britton and Joseph H. Rose , The Cactaceae (New York: Dover Pub. Inc., 1963 reprint) Vol. 2 p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The large, cream-colored, nocturnal [[flower]]s remain open for only one night. The [[fruit]]s, known locally as [[pitaya]], ''olala'' (only in some parts of [[Bolivia]]) or Peruvian apple, are thornless and vary in skin colour from violet-red to yellow. The edible flesh is white and contains small, edible, crunchy seeds. The flesh sweetens as the fruit opens out fully.

''Cereus repandus'' is an unresearched, under-utilized cactus, grown mostly as an ornamental plant. As noted above, it has some local culinary importance. The [[Wayuu]] from the [[La Guajira Peninsula]] of [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]] also use the inner cane-like wood of the plant in [[wattle and daub]] construction.&lt;ref name = villalobosetal2007 /&gt;

The '''contact angle''' is the [[angle]], conventionally measured through the liquid, where a [[liquid]]–[[vapor]] [[interface (chemistry)|interface]] meets a [[solid]] surface. It quantifies the [[wetting|wettability]] of a solid surface by a liquid via the Young equation. A given system of solid, liquid, and vapor at a given temperature and pressure has a unique equilibrium contact angle. However, in practice a dynamic phenomenon of [[#Hysteresis|contact angle hysteresis]] is often observed, ranging from the advancing (maximal) contact angle to the receding (minimal) contact angle &lt;ref name="CAH"&gt; {{cite journal|last1= Shi| first1= Z. | last2=et al. | title= Dynamic contact angle hysteresis in liquid bridges| journal= Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects  | year=2018 | volume=555  | pages= 365–371|url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092777571830606X| doi=10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.07.004| arxiv= 1712.04703 }} &lt;/ref&gt;. The equilibrium contact is within those values, and can be [[hysteresis|calculated from them]]. The equilibrium contact angle reflects the relative strength of the liquid, solid, and vapor [[intermolecular force|molecular interaction]].

==Thermodynamics==
[[File:Contact angle.svg|thumb|400 px|Schematic of a liquid drop showing the quantities in the Young equation.]]
The shape of a liquid–vapor interface is determined by the [[Young–Laplace equation]], with the contact angle playing the role of a [[boundary value problem|boundary condition]] via the [[wetting#Simplification to planar geometry.2C Young.27s relation|Young equation]].

The theoretical description of contact arises from the consideration of a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] between the three [[phase (matter)|phases]]: the [[liquid]] phase (L), the [[solid]] phase (S), and the gas or [[vapor]] phase (G) (which could be a mixture of ambient atmosphere and an equilibrium concentration of the liquid vapor). (The "gaseous" phase could be replaced by another [[miscibility|immiscible]] liquid phase.) If the solid–vapor [[surface energy|interfacial energy]] is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{SG}&lt;/math&gt;, the solid–liquid interfacial energy by &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{SL}&lt;/math&gt;, and the liquid–vapor interfacial energy (i.e. the [[surface tension]]) by &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{LG}&lt;/math&gt;, then the equilibrium contact angle &lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{C}&lt;/math&gt; is determined from these quantities by the [[wetting#Simplification to planar geometry.2C Young.27s relation|Young equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_\mathrm{SG} - \gamma_\mathrm{SL} - \gamma_\mathrm{LG} \cos \theta_\mathrm{C}=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

The contact angle can also be related to the work of [[adhesion]] via the [[Young–Dupré equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_\mathrm{LV} (1 + \cos \theta_\mathrm{C} )= \Delta W_\mathrm{SLV} \,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta W_\mathrm{SLV}&lt;/math&gt; is the solid – liquid adhesion energy per unit area when in the medium V.

===Contact Angle Hysteresis===
A given substrate-liquid-vapor combination yields a continuous range of contact angle values in practice. The maximum contact angle is referred to as the advancing contact angle and the minimum contact angle is referred to as the receding contact angle. The advancing and receding contact angles are measured from dynamic experiments where droplets or liquid bridges are in movement &lt;ref name="CAH" /&gt;. In contrast, the equilibrium contact angle described by the Young-LaPlace equation is measured from a static state. Static measurements yield values in-between the advancing and receding contact angle depending on deposition parameters (e.g. velocity, angle, and drop size) and drop history (e.g. evaporation from time of deposition). Contact angle hysteresis is defined as &lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{A} - \theta_\mathrm{R}&lt;/math&gt;although the term is also used to describe the expression &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta_\mathrm{R}-\cos\theta_\mathrm{A}&lt;/math&gt;.The static, advancing, or receding contact angle can be used in place of the equilibrium contact angle depending on the application.

The advancing contact angle can be described as a measure of the liquid-solid cohesion while the receding contact angle is a measure of liquid-solid adhesion. The advancing and receding contact angles can be measured directly using different methods and can also be calculated from other wetting measurements such as force tensiometery (aka [[Wilhelmy plate|Wilhemy-Plate]] method). 

Advancing and receding contact angles can be measured directly from the same measurement if drops are moved linearly on a surface. For example, a drop of liquid will adopt a given contact angle when static, but when the surface is tilted the drop will initially deform so that the contact area between the drop and surface remains constant. The "downhill" side of the drop will adopt a higher contact angle while the "uphill" side of the drop will adopt a lower contact angle. As the tilt angle increases the contact angles will continue to change but the contact area between the drop and surface will remain constant. At a given surface tilt angle, the advancing and receding contact angles will be met and the drop will move on the surface. In practice, the measurement can be influenced by shear forces and momentum if the tilt velocity is high. The measurement method can also be challenging in practice for systems with high (&gt;30 degrees) or low (&lt;10 degrees) contact angle hysteresis. 

Advancing and receding contact angle measurements can be carried out by adding and removing liquid from a drop deposited on a surface. If a sufficiently small volume of liquid is added to a drop, the contact line will still be pinned, and the contact angle will increase. Similarly, if a small  amount of liquid is removed from a drop, the contact angle will decrease. 

The Young's equation assumes a homogeneous surface and does not account for surface texture or outside forces such as gravity. Real surfaces are not atomically smooth or chemically homogeneous so a drop will assume contact angle hysteresis. The equilibrium contact angle (&lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{c}&lt;/math&gt;) can be calculated from &lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{R}&lt;/math&gt; as was shown theoretically by Tadmor &lt;ref name="Tadm"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Line energy and the relation between advancing, receding, and Young contact angles|doi=10.1021/la049410h|year=2004|last1=Tadmor|first1=Rafael|journal=Langmuir|volume=20|pages=7659–64|pmid=15323516|issue=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed experimentally by Chibowski &lt;ref name="Chib"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jcis.2007.10.059|pmid=18177886 |title=Surface free energy of sulfur—Revisited I. Yellow and orange samples solidified against glass surface |year=2008|last1=Chibowski|first1=Emil|journal=Journal of Colloid and Interface Science|volume=319|issue=2 |pages=505–13|bibcode=2008JCIS..319..505C}}&lt;/ref&gt; as,

:&lt;math&gt;
\theta_\mathrm{c}=\arccos\left(\frac{r_\mathrm{A}\cos{\theta_\mathrm{A}}+r_\mathrm{R}\cos{\theta_\mathrm{R}}}{r_\mathrm{A}+r_\mathrm{R}}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
r_\mathrm{A}=\left(\frac{\sin^3{\theta_\mathrm{A}}}{2-3\cos{\theta_\mathrm{A}}+\cos^3{\theta_\mathrm{A}}}\right)^{1/3}
~;~~
r_\mathrm{R}=\left(\frac{\sin^3{\theta_\mathrm{R}}}{2-3\cos{\theta_\mathrm{R}}+\cos^3{\theta_\mathrm{R}}}\right)^{1/3}
&lt;/math&gt;

On a surface that is rough or contaminated, there will also be contact angle hysteresis, but now the local equilibrium contact angle (the Young equation is now only locally valid) may vary from place to place on the surface.&lt;ref name=deGennes&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Gennes|first=P.G.|title=Wetting: statics and dynamics|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|year=1985|volume=57|issue=3|pages=827–863|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.57.827|bibcode= 1985RvMP...57..827D}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Young–Dupré equation, this means that the adhesion energy varies locally – thus, the liquid has to overcome local energy barriers in order to wet the surface. One consequence of these barriers is contact angle [[hysteresis]]: the extent of wetting, and therefore the observed contact angle (averaged along the contact line), depends on whether the liquid is advancing or receding on the surface.

Because liquid advances over previously dry surface but recedes from previously wet surface, contact angle hysteresis can also arise if the solid has been altered due to its previous contact with the liquid (e.g., by a chemical reaction, or absorption). Such alterations, if slow, can also produce measurably time-dependent contact angles.

===Effect of roughness to contact angles===
Surface roughness has a strong effect on the contact angle and wettability of a surface. The effect of roughness depends on if the droplet will wet the surface grooves or if air pockets will be left between the droplet and the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/516902/Pdf/Attension/Theory%20Notes/AT-TN-07-Surface-roughness-CA-wettability.pdf?t=1509632879462|title=Influence of surface roughness on contact angle and wettability|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the surface is wetted homogeneously, the droplet is in Wenzel state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wenzel|first=Robert N.|date=1936-08-01|title=RESISTANCE OF SOLID SURFACES TO WETTING BY WATER|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry|volume=28|issue=8|pages=988–994|doi=10.1021/ie50320a024|issn=0019-7866}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Wenzel state, adding surface roughness will enhance the wettability caused by the chemistry of the surface. The Wenzel correlation can be written as
:&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\cos(\theta_m)=r\cos(\theta_Y)&lt;/math&gt;
where θ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the measured contact angle, θ&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt; is the Young contact angle and r is the roughness ratio. The roughness ratio is defined as the ratio between the actual and projected solid surface area.

If the surface is wetted heterogeneously, the droplet is in Cassie-Baxter state. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cassie|first=A. B. D.|last2=Baxter|first2=S.|date=1944-01-01|title=Wettability of porous surfaces|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=tf9444000546|journal=Transactions of the Faraday Society|language=en|volume=40|pages=546|doi=10.1039/tf9444000546|issn=0014-7672}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most stable contact angle can be connected to the Young contact angle. The contact angles calculated from the Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter equations have been found to be good approximations of the most stable contact angles with real surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marmur|first=Abraham|date=2009-07-06|title=Solid-Surface Characterization by Wetting|journal=Annual Review of Materials Research|volume=39|issue=1|pages=473–489|doi=10.1146/annurev.matsci.38.060407.132425|issn=1531-7331|bibcode=2009AnRMS..39..473M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic Contact Angles===
For liquid moving quickly over a surface, the contact angle can be altered from its value at rest. The advancing contact angle will increase with speed, and the receding contact angle will decrease. The discrepancies between static and dynamic contact angles are closely proportional to the [[Capillary number]], noted &lt;math&gt;Ca&lt;/math&gt;.

==Contact angle curvature==
On the basis of interfacial energies, the profile of a surface droplet or a liquid bridge between two surfaces can be described by the [[Young–Laplace equation]] &lt;ref name="CAH" /&gt;. This equation is applicable for three-dimensional axisymmetric conditions and is highly non-linear. This is due to the [[mean curvature]] term which includes products of first- and second-order derivatives of the drop shape function &lt;math&gt;f\left(x,y\right)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\kappa_m=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\left(1+{f_x}^2\right)f_{yy}-2f_x f_y f_{xy} + \left(1+{f_y}^2\right)f_{xx}}{\left(1+{f_x}^2+{f_y}^2\right)^{3/2}} &lt;/math&gt;.

Solving this [[elliptic partial differential equation]] that governs the shape of a three-dimensional drop, in conjunction with appropriate boundary conditions, is complicated, and an alternate energy minimization approach to this is generally adopted. The shapes of three-dimensional sessile and pendant drops have been successfully predicted using this energy minimisation method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chen Y, He B, Lee J, Patankar NA|title=Anisotropy in the wetting of rough surfaces|url=http://files.instrument.com.cn/filescenter/20060113/16969.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcis.2004.07.038|pmid=15571703|journal=Journal of Colloid and Interface Science|year=2005|volume=281|issue=2|pages=458–464|bibcode=2005JCIS..281..458C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bhutani&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1615/InterfacPhenomHeatTransfer.2013007038 |title=Determination of apparent contact angle and shape of a static pendant drop on a physically textured inclined surface|journal=Interfacial Phenomena and Heat Transfer|year=2013|volume=1|pages=29–49|last1=Bhutani|first1=Gaurav|last2=Muralidhar|first2=K.|last3=Khandekar|first3=Sameer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical contact angles==
[[File:Video contact angle.gif|thumb|Image from a video contact angle device. Water drop on [[glass]], with reflection below.|alt=Side view of a very wide, short drop of water with a low contact angle.]]
[[File:DropConnectionAngel.jpg|thumb|right|A water drop on a lotus leaf surface showing contact angles of approximately 147°.]]
Contact angles are extremely sensitive to contamination; values reproducible to better than a few degrees are generally only obtained under laboratory conditions with purified liquids and very clean solid surfaces. If the liquid molecules are strongly attracted to the solid molecules then the liquid drop will completely spread out on the solid surface, corresponding to a contact angle of 0°. This is often the case for water on bare [[metal]]lic or [[ceramic]] surfaces,&lt;ref name=zisman&gt;{{cite book|last=Zisman|first=W.A.|title=Contact Angle, Wettability, and Adhesion|year=1964|publisher=ACS|pages=1–51|editor=F. Fowkes}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the presence of an [[oxide]] layer or contaminants on the solid surface can significantly increase the contact angle. Generally, if the water contact angle is smaller than 90°, the solid surface is considered [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cvn5l-QytVIC&amp;pg=PA471|page=471|title=Surface design: applications in bioscience and nanotechnology|author1=Renate Förch |author2=Holger Schönherr |author3=A. Tobias A. Jenkins |publisher=Wiley-VCH|year=2009|isbn=978-3-527-40789-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if the water contact angle is larger than 90°, the solid surface is considered [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]]. Many [[polymer]]s exhibit hydrophobic surfaces. Highly hydrophobic surfaces made of low surface energy (e.g. [[fluorination|fluorinated]]) materials may have water contact angles as high as ~120°.&lt;ref name=zisman/&gt; Some materials with highly rough surfaces may have a water contact angle even greater than 150°, due to the presence of air pockets under the liquid drop. These are called [[superhydrophobe|superhydrophobic]] surfaces.

If the contact angle is measured through the gas instead of through the liquid, then it should be replaced by 180° minus their given value. Contact angles are equally applicable to the interface of two liquids, though they are more commonly measured in solid products such as [[cookware#Non-stick|non-stick pans]] and [[waterproof fabric]]s.

==Control of contact angles==
Control of the wetting contact angle can often be achieved through the deposition or incorporation of various organic and inorganic molecules onto the surface. This is often achieved through the use of specialty silane chemicals which can form a SAM (self-assembled monolayers) layer. With the proper selection of the organic molecules with varying molecular structures and amounts of hydrocarbon and/or perfluoronated terminations, the contact angle of the surface can tune. The deposition of these specialty silanes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ma.ecsdl.org/content/MA2006-01/23/781.abstract|author=Kobrin, B.; Zhang, T. and Chinn, J. |chapter=Choice of precursors in Vapor-phase Surface Modification|title=209th Electrochemical Society meeting, May 7–12, 2006, Denver, CO}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be achieved in the gas phase through the use of a specialized vacuum ovens or liquid-phase process. Molecules that can bind more perfluorinated terminations to the surface can results in lowering the surface energy (high water contact angle).

==Measuring methods==
[[File:Rame-hart goniometer.jpg|thumb|A [[contact angle goniometer]] is used to measure the contact angle.]]
[[File:Dynamic contact angle measurement.svg|thumb|Dynamic sessile drop method]]

===The static sessile drop method===
{{Main|Sessile drop technique}}
The sessile drop contact angle is measured by a [[contact angle goniometer]] using an optical subsystem to capture the profile of a pure liquid on a solid substrate. The angle formed between the liquid–solid interface and the liquid–vapor interface is the contact angle. Older systems used a microscope optical system with a back light. Current-generation systems employ high resolution cameras and software to capture and analyze the contact angle. Angles measured in such a way are often quite close to advancing contact angles. Equilibrium contact angles can be obtained through the application of well defined vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Volpe, C. D.; Brugnara, M.; Maniglio, D.; Siboni, S.; Wangdu, T.|title=About the possibility of experimentally measuring an equilibrium contact angle and its theoretical and practical consequences|journal=Contact Angle, Wettability and Adhesion|year=2006|volume=4|pages=79–100|url=http://app.knovel.com/web/toc.v/cid:kpCAWAV011/viewerType:toc/root_slug:contact-angle-wettability-3/url_slug:study-surface-charge#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The pendant drop method===
Measuring contact angles for pendant drops is much more complicated than for sessile drops due to the inherent unstable nature of inverted drops. This complexity is further amplified when one attempts to incline the surface. Experimental apparatus to measure pendant drop contact angles on inclined substrates has been developed recently.&lt;ref name=bhutani/&gt; This method allows for the deposition of multiple microdrops on the underside of a textured substrate, which can be imaged using a high resolution [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] camera. An automated system allows for tilting the substrate and analysing the images for the calculation of advancing and receding contact angles.

===The dynamic sessile drop method===
{{Main|Sessile drop technique}}
The dynamic sessile drop is similar to the static sessile drop but requires the drop to be modified. A common type of dynamic sessile drop study determines the largest contact angle possible without increasing its solid–liquid interfacial area by adding volume dynamically. This maximum angle is the advancing angle. Volume is removed to produce the smallest possible angle, the receding angle. The difference between the advancing and receding angle is the contact angle [[hysteresis]].

===Dynamic Wilhelmy method===
[[File:Dynamic contact angle Attension Sigma.png|alt=Measuring dynamic contact angle of a rod/fiber with a force tensiometer.|thumb|Measuring dynamic contact angle of a rod/fiber with a force tensiometer.]]
A method for calculating average advancing and receding contact angles on solids of uniform geometry. Both sides of the solid must have the same properties. Wetting force on the solid is measured as the solid is immersed in or withdrawn from a liquid of known surface tension. Also in that case it is possible to measure the equilibrium contact angle by applying a very controlled vibration. That methodology, called VIECA, can be implemented in a quite simple way on every [[Wilhelmy plate|Wilhelmy]] balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Volpe, C. D.; Maniglio, D.; Siboni, S.; Morra, M.|title=An experimental procedure to obtain the equilibrium contact angle from the Wilhelmy method|url=http://ogst.ifpenergiesnouvelles.fr/articles/ogst/pdf/2001/01/della_volpe_v56n1.pdf|doi=10.2516/ogst:2001002|journal=Oil and Gas Science and Technology|year=2001|volume=56|pages=9–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single-fiber Wilhelmy method===
Dynamic Wilhelmy method applied to single fibers to measure advancing and receding contact angles.
[[File:Meniscus contact angle Attension Theta.png|alt=Single-fiber meniscus contact angle measurement.|thumb|Single-fiber meniscus contact angle measurement.]]

===Single-fiber meniscus method===
An optical variation of the single-fiber Wilhelmy method. Instead of measuring with a balance, the shape of the meniscus on the fiber is directly imaged using a high resolution camera. Automated meniscus shape fitting can then directly measure the static, advancing or receding contact angle on the fiber.

===Washburn's equation capillary rise method===
{{Main|Washburn's equation}}
In case of a porous materials many issues have been raised both about the physical meaning of the calculated pore diameter and the real possibility to use this equation for the calculation of the contact angle of the solid, even if this method is often offered by much software as consolidated.&lt;ref name=Brugnara&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marco |first1=Brugnara |last2=Claudio |first2=Della Volpe |last3=Stefano |first3=Siboni |chapter=Wettability of porous materials.

'''Copper(I) oxide''' or '''cuprous oxide''' is the [[inorganic compound]] with the formula Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. It is one of the principal [[oxide]]s of [[copper]], the other being CuO or [[Copper(II) oxide|cupric oxide]]. This red-coloured solid is a component of some [[antifouling]] paints.  The compound can appear either yellow or red, depending on the size of the particles.&lt;ref&gt;N. N. Greenwood, A. Earnshaw, ''Chemistry of the Elements'', 2nd ed., Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford, UK, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Copper(I) oxide is found as the reddish [[mineral]] [[cuprite]].

==Preparation==
Copper(I) oxide may be produced by several methods.&lt;ref&gt;H. Wayne Richardson "Copper Compounds'' in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a07_567}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most straightforwardly, it arises via the oxidation of copper metal:
: 4 Cu  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →  2 Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Additives such as water and acids affect the rate of this process as well as the further oxidation to copper(II) oxides. It is also produced commercially by reduction of copper(II) solutions with [[sulfur dioxide]].  Aqueous cuprous chloride solutions react with base to give the same material.  In all cases, the color is highly sensitive to the procedural details.

[[File:Cu-pourbaix-diagram.svg|thumbnail|left|	 [[Pourbaix diagram]] for copper in uncomplexed media (anions other than OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; not considered). Ion concentration 0.001 m (mol/kg water). Temperature 25°C.]]

Formation of copper(I) oxide is the basis of the [[Fehling's solution|Fehling's test]] and [[Benedict's reagent|Benedict's test]] for reducing [[sugar]]s. These sugars reduce an [[alkaline]] solution of a copper(II) salt, giving a bright red [[precipitate]] of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

It forms on [[silver]]-plated copper parts exposed to moisture when the silver layer is porous or damaged.  This kind of [[corrosion]] is known as [[red plague (corrosion)|red plague]].

Little &lt;!--none really--&gt; evidence exists for cuprous hydroxide, which is expected to rapidly undergo dehydration.  A similar situation applies to the hydroxides of gold(I) and silver(I).

==Properties==
The solid is [[diamagnetic]].  In terms of their coordination spheres, copper centres are 2-coordinated and the oxides are tetrahedral.  The structure thus resembles in some sense the main polymorphs of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and both structures feature interpenetrated lattices.

Copper(I) oxide dissolves in concentrated [[ammonia]] solution to form the colourless [[complex (chemistry)|complex]] [Cu(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which is easily [[redox|oxidized]] in air to the blue [Cu(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. It dissolves in [[hydrochloric acid]] to give solutions of CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.  Dilute [[sulfuric acid]] and [[nitric acid]] produce [[copper(II) sulfate]] and [[copper(II) nitrate]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;D. Nicholls, ''Complexes and First-Row Transition Elements'', Macmillan Press, London, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O degrades to [[copper(II) oxide]] in moist air.

== Structure ==
Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O crystallizes in a [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] structure with a lattice constant a&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;=4.2696 Å. The Cu atoms arrange in a [[Bravais lattice|fcc]] sublattice, the O atoms in a [[Bravais lattice|bcc]] sublattice. One sublattice is shifted by a quarter of the body diagonal. The [[space group]] is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Pn\bar{3}m&lt;/math&gt;, which includes the [[point group]] with full octahedral symmetry.

==Semiconducting properties==
In the history of [[semiconductor]] physics, Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is one of the most studied materials, and many experimental observations and semiconductor applications have been demonstrated first in this material:
*[[Semiconductor]]
*Semiconductor [[diode]]s&lt;ref&gt;L. O. Grondahl, Unidirectional current carrying device, Patent, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;
*Phonoritons &lt;ref&gt;L. Hanke, D. Fröhlich, A.L. Ivanov, P.B. Littlewood, and H. Stolz "LA-Phonoritons in Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" ''[[Phys. Rev. Lett.]]'' '''83''' (1999), 4365.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Brillouin: ''Wave Propagation and Group Velocity'', [[Academic Press]], [[New York City]], 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;
The lowest excitons in Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are extremely long lived; absorption lineshapes have been demonstrated with [[electronvolt|neV]] linewidths, which is the narrowest bulk exciton resonance ever observed.&lt;ref&gt;J. Brandt, D. Fröhlich, C. Sandfort, M. Bayer, H. Stolz, and N. Naka, ''Ultranarrow absorption and two-phonon excitation spectroscopy of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O paraexcitons in a high magnetic field'', Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 217403 (2007). {{DOI|10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.217403}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The associated quadrupole [[polariton]]s have low [[group velocity]] approaching the speed of sound. Thus, light moves almost as slowly as sound in this medium, which results in high polariton densities.
Another unusual feature of the [[ground state]] excitons is that all primary scattering mechanisms are known quantitatively.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Wolfe and A. Mysyrowicz: Excitonic Matter, ''[[Scientific American]]'' '''250''' (1984), No. 3, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O was the first substance where an entirely parameter-free model of [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] [[linewidth]] broadening by [[temperature]] could be established, allowing the corresponding [[absorption coefficient]] to be deduced. It can be shown using Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O that the [[Kramers–Kronig relation]]s do not apply to polaritons.&lt;ref name="Hopfield1958"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopfield|first1=J.

==Applications==
Cuprous oxide is commonly used as a [[pigment]], a [[fungicide]], and an anti[[fouling]] agent for marine paints.  [[Rectifier|Rectifier diode]]s based on this material have been used industrially as early as 1924, long before [[silicon]] became the standard.  Copper(I) oxide is also responsible for the pink color in a positive [[Benedict's reagent|Benedict's test]].

{{unreferenced|date=May 2013}}
'''Dó paper''' ({{lang-zh|竹紙}} ; "bamboo paper") is a paper made from the bark of the [[Rhamnoneuron balansae]] traditionally produced in many villages in [[Vietnam]]. It plays an important role in folk art, [[Dong Ho Painting]] in particular, because of its durability.

== Production process ==
The production process includes some stages. First, the bark is soaked in [[limewater]] for three months. Second, the black outer bark is husked off and ground by mortar and pestle before being blended with a viscous substance made from a plant belonging to [[Verbenaceae]] family. This mixture is diluted to form a slurry. A bamboo mold ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: liềm xeo) is dipped into the vat of slurry and removed. Paper fibers adhere to the mold in a thin sheet that is then pressed, dried, rolled, and dried again. The final product must be soft, light, and durable.

==Applications==
Due to its durability, this paper found many uses in traditional Vietnam, including the making of books, paintings, and documents.

'''Garissa Power Station''' is a {{convert|55|MW|abbr=on}} [[Solar power|solar]] power plant under construction in [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name="Build"&gt;{{cite web|title=REA to build Sh12.8 billion solar farm in Garissa |accessdate=30 September 2016  |url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/539546-3139990-jia501/index.html |date=31 March  2016 | first=Neville | last=Otuki |newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]] | location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The power station is located in [[Garissa County]] about {{convert|20|km|0}}, north of the town of [[Garissa]].&lt;ref name="Build"/&gt; This is approximately {{convert|385|km|0}} by road, north-east of [[Nairobi]], the country's capital and largest city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=30 September 2016 |

==Overview==
The solar farm sits on {{convert|85|ha|acre}} and consist of 200,200 solar panels and is expected to be the largest in East and Central Africa. It is expected to create about 1,000 jobs during the construction period.&lt;ref name="Buy"/&gt; The power from this power station is enough to power about 625,000 homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Sh12bn-solar-project-given-green-light/1056-3140280-ejmok7/index.html | title=Sh12 billion solar project given green light | accessdate=30 September 2016 |date=31 March 2016 | newspaper=[[Daily Nation]] |first=Elizabeth |last=Merab | location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power station is owned and operated by [http://www.rea.co.ke/ Kenya Rural Electrification Authority], a [[government of Kenya|government]] agency. The power generated will be sold to Kenya Power and Lighting for integration into the national grid.&lt;ref name="Buy"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=30 September 2016 | url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Kenya-s-largest-solar-plant-inks-power-sale-deal/539546-3399466-3pfwetz/index.html | title=Kenya’s largest solar plant inks power sale deal | date=29 September 2016 | first=Neville |newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]] |last=Otuki | location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, the [[Business Daily Africa]], reported that the expected commissioning of this power plant had been pushed back to December 2018, following delays.&lt;ref name="New"&gt;{{cite web|  url=https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/economy/Garissa-55MW-solar-farm-starts-operations/3946234-4315276-g2qldpz/index.html |title=Garissa-based 55MW solar farm starts operations in December |date=22 February 2018 |first=Lynet |last=Igadwah |
newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]]|location=Nairobi |access-date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power purchase agreement, signed in September 2016, calls for Kenya Power to sell electricity from the solar plant at KSh12 (US$0.12) per kilowatt hour, approximately KSh8 cheaper than diesel-generated electricity.&lt;ref name="New"/&gt;

==Construction timeline, costs, and funding==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31549">'''[[Hydraulic jump]] in a rectangular channel''', also known as '''classical jump''', is a [[natural phenomenon]] that occurs whenever flow changes from supercritical to subcritical flow. In this transition, the water surface rises abruptly, surface rollers are formed, intense mixing occurs, air is entrained, and often a large amount of energy is dissipated. In other words, a hydraulic jump happens when a higher [[velocity]], ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, [[supercritical flow]] upstream is met by a subcritical downstream flow with a decreased velocity, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and sufficient depth. Numeric models created using the [[standard step method]] or [[HEC-RAS]] are used to track supercritical and subcritical flows to determine where in a specific reach a hydraulic jump will form.

There are common hydraulic jumps that occur in everyday situations such as during the use of a household sink. There are also man-made hydraulic jumps created by devices like weirs or sluice gates. In general, a hydraulic jump may be used to dissipate energy, to mix chemicals, or to act as an aeration device.&lt;ref name="Chanson_2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title= Current Knowledge In Hydraulic Jumps And Related Phenomena.

To produce equations describing the jump, since there is an unknown energy loss, there is a need to apply [[momentum–depth relationship in a rectangular channel#Conservation of Momentum|conservation of momentum]].&lt;ref name="Chanson_2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title= Momentum Considerations in Hydraulic Jumps and Bores |url= http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:273253  |publisher=Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering, ASCE, Vol. 138, No. 4, pp. 382–385 (DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000409) |year=2012 |issn= 0733-9437}}&lt;/ref&gt; To develop this equation, a general situation in which there may or may not be an energy loss between upstream and downstream, and there may or may not be some obstacle on which there is a drag force P&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is considered. however, for a simple or classic hydraulic jump the force per unit width(P&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) equals 0. From there the momentum equation, and the conjugate depths equation can be derived.

A series of small surface rollers are formed in a [[standing wave]] like the one shown in Figure 1.

=== Common hydraulic jumps ===
Hydraulic jumps occur commonly in everyday situations such as during the use of any household [[sink]].  The jump can be seen in the form of a circular, stationary [[wave]] surrounding the inflow of water.  The hydraulic jump occurs at the point where the seemingly still water becomes turbulent.  As water hits the sink, it disperses, increasing in depth to a critical radius where the flow (supercritical with low depth, high velocity, and a [[Froude number]] greater than 1) must suddenly jump to a greater, subcritical depth (high depth, low velocity, and a Froude number less than 1) that is known to conserve [[momentum]].

=== Man-made hydraulic jumps ===
Hydraulic jumps may also be manmade; as seen in Figure 2, scientists have been experimenting with the effects of [[viscosity]] on the hydraulic jump and have been able to create steady asymmetrical forms.&lt;ref name="JB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-math.mit.edu/~bush/jump.htm |title=Surface Tension and the Hydraulic Jump |publisher=Math.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In more practical applications, jumps are created in the environment with specific purposes such as [[erosion]] prevention.  Erosion in stream beds is often caused by a high velocity water flow which leads to [[sediment]] transport.  This process can be prevented by decreasing the velocity of the flow into the stream bed with the introduction of a hydraulic jump.  Often in these cases, a hydraulic jump is created by devices such as a [[weir]] or [[sluice gate]] where the turbulent flow enters the stream.  The mixture of chemical constituents in a solution is another practical use for hydraulic jumps.  Introducing a hydraulic jump rapidly increases the turbulence of the flow, allowing sufficient constituent mixing without the use of any additional mechanisms.  The wastewater industry sometimes uses hydraulic jumps as a way to mix solutions, minimizing the need to implement more expensive mechanical mixing systems.

Still another use for manmade hydraulic jumps is [[energy dissipation]].  One example of an energy dissipating use is a hydraulic jump stilling basin.  In these basins, horizontal and sloping aprons are used to dissipate up to 60% of the energy of incoming flow; the basins implement devices such as chute blocks, baffle piers, and dentated ends whose effectiveness in energy dissipation is dependent on the Froude number of the incoming flow.  ‘Hydraulic jump stilling basins are not typically suggested for use when dealing with heads greater than 100 meters due to complications caused by turbulences like intermittent [[cavitation]], vibration, uplift, and hydrodynamic loading.’&lt;ref name = "Khat"&gt;[Khatsuria, R.M. The Hydraulics of Spillways and Energy Dissipators. {{ISBN|0-8247-5789-0}}. CRC Press, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other hydraulic structures such as [[dam]]s and weirs also use these same energy dissipating principles to reduce the incoming force from turbulent flows that tend to scour or erode downstream areas.

==Derivation of formula for simple, momentum conserving hydraulic jump in rectangular channel==

===Definitions of momentum===
Momentum is defined as the product of mass times velocity, and like velocity, it is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]].  French Scientist and Philosopher of the early 1600s [[René Descartes]] first discovered the concept of momentum but got stuck on the amount of motion (speed) which was not being conserved. [[Christian Huygens]], a Dutch Scientist, pointed out that the "quantity of motion" did not need to be a positive value; a negative value meant that it was moving in the opposite direction.

===Definition of variables===
: ''mv'' = momentum = mass x velocity [=]  MLT&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
: ''ρ'' = density [=] ML&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;
: ''q'' = ''Q''''/''w'' = flow rate per unit width [=] L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
: ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; = dynamic force due to frictional resistance [=] MLT&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
: ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = upstream pressure [=] ML&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
: ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = downstream pressure force [=] ML&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
: ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = upstream depth [=] L
: ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = downstream depth [=] L
: ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;  = Froude number [dimensionless]  [=] L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
: ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = height of hydraulic jump [=] L
: ''M'' = momentum function (specific force + momentum) [=] L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
: ''γ'' = specific weight of water (9810 N/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) [=] ML&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;

The basic principles behind the momentum function are:
# [[Conservation of momentum]] which "states that the total momentum of a closed system of objects (which has no interactions with external agents) is constant" and
# [[Newton's laws of motion]] stating that the sum of the forces in a particular direction is equal to the mass times acceleration in that direction.
{{Confusing|section|date=October 2013}} 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum F_x = \Delta (ma_x)&lt;/math&gt; {{Clarify|date=October 2013}}
:&lt;math&gt;\sum F = \Delta m \times \frac{dy}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; = change in mass &amp;times; change in velocity  {{Vague|see [[Newton's laws of motion#Variable-mass systems]]|date=October 2013}}
:momentum = ''mv''
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta mv = \Delta m \times \frac{dy}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; = change in mass &amp;times; change in velocity
:&lt;math&gt;\sum F_x = \Delta (mv_x)&lt;/math&gt;

The following [[Formal proof|derivation]] is for the momentum function of a simple momentum conserving hydraulic jump in a rectangular channel with constant width.

# Change in momentum.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\Delta (mv)(w) = \rho(Q)(v_2 - v_1)&lt;/math&gt;
# Divide through by ''w'' to obtain ''q''.  Change in momentum per unit width. &lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\Delta (mv) = \rho q(v_2 - v_1)&lt;/math&gt;
# Sum of forces in the direction of flow. &lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sum F = P_1 - P_2 - F_d \qquad \text{where } P = {\gamma \times y^2 \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;
# The sum of forces is equal to the momentum change. &lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;{\gamma \times y_1^2 \over 2} - {\gamma \times y_2^2 \over 2} - F_d = \rho q(v_2 - v_1)&lt;/math&gt;
# Divide by γ. &lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;{y_1^2 \over 2} - {y_2^2 \over 2} - {F_d \over \gamma} = {\rho \times q \times (v_2 - v_1) \over \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;
# Recall that &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{g} = {\rho \over \gamma}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;{y_1^2 \over 2} + {qv_1 \over g} = {y_2^2 \over 2} + {qv_2 \over g}&lt;/math&gt;
# Recall that &lt;math&gt;v = \frac{q}{y}&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the equation for M. &lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;M = {y_1^2 \over 2} + {q^2 \over gy_1} = {y_2^2 \over 2} + {q^2 \over gy_2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Conjugate depths relationships==

===Definition of conjugate depths===
[[Conjugate depth]]s are the depths (''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) upstream and the depth (y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) downstream of the hydraulic jump whose momentum functions are equal for a given unit discharge,&amp;nbsp;''q''.  The depth upstream of a hydraulic jump is always supercritical, and the depth downstream of a hydraulic jump is always subcritical. It is important to note that the conjugate depth is different than the alternate depths for flow which are used in energy conservation calculations.

===Mathematical derivation of equation===
(1) Beginning with  momentum function{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}, we equate momentum between locations 1 and 2: 
:&lt;math&gt;M=\frac{y_1^2}{2}+\frac{q^2}{g y_1}=\frac{y_2^2}{2}+\frac{q^2}{g y_2}&lt;/math&gt;
(2) Rearranging terms by moving the q terms to the left and the 1/2 terms to the right, we get:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{q^2}{g}\left(\frac{1}{y_1}-\frac{1}{y_2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(y_2^2-y_1^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;
(3) We then multiply to get a common denominator on the left-hand side and factor the right-hand side:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{q^2}{g}\left(\frac{y_2-y_1}{y_1 y_2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}(y_2-y_1)(y_2+y_1)&lt;/math&gt;
(4) The (''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;minus;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) term cancels out:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{q^2}{g}\left(\frac{1}{y_1 y_2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}(y_2+y_1)\qquad\text{where }q_1^2=y_1^2 v_1^2=y_2^2 v_2^2&lt;/math&gt;
(5) Divide by ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_1^2}{g}\left(\frac{1}{y_1 y_2}\right)=\frac{1}{2 y_1^2}(y_2+y_1)\qquad\text{recall }F r_1^2=\frac{v_1^2}{g y_1}&lt;/math&gt;
(6) Multiply by ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and expand right-hand side:
:&lt;math&gt;F r_1^2=\frac{y_2^2}{2 y_1^2}+\frac{y_2}{2 y_1}&lt;/math&gt;
(7) Substitute ''x'' for the quantity ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. We have a quadratic equation in x:
:&lt;math&gt;F r_1^2=\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow 0=\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x}{2}-F r_1^2\qquad \Rightarrow 0=x^2+x-2F r_1^2\qquad a=1,\;b=1,\;c=-2F r_1^2&lt;/math&gt;
(8) Using the quadratic equation:
:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-1\pm\sqrt{1-4(1^2)(-2F r_1^2)}}{2(1)}=\frac{-1\pm\sqrt{1+8F r_1^2}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:Since:
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1+8F r_1^2}&lt;/math&gt; must be positive,
:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-1-\sqrt{1+8F r_1^2)}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; produces a negative number.
:This is not possible because x represents a ratio of positive depths &lt;math&gt;\frac{y_2}{y_1}&lt;/math&gt;.
(9) Hence, substituting the constant ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; back in for ''x'' to get the conjugate depth equation:
:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-1+\sqrt{1+8F r_1^2}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{y_2}{y_1}=\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{1+8 F r_1^2} - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

==Relationship of conjugate depths on M-y diagram==

===Example 1: Conjugate depths and the M-y diagram===
Given: &lt;br&gt;
::Rectangular channel
::Flow per unit width, q = 10 ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s
::Depth, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.24 ft
Find: &lt;br&gt;
::M-y Diagram and depth after the hydraulic jump
Solution: &lt;br&gt;
::For depth after hydraulic jump, y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;(1)\quad y_2=\frac{y_1}{2}\left(\sqrt{1+8 F r_1^2}-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(2)\quad F r_1=\frac{v}{(g y_1)^{1/2}}=\frac{q}{y_1(g y_1)^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(3)\quad F r_1^2=\frac{q^2}{g y_1^3}=\frac{(10)^2}{32.2*(0.24^3)}=224.65&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(4)\quad y_2=\frac{0.24}{2}\sqrt{1+8(224.65)}-1=4.97\;ft&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(5)\quad M_1=\frac{(0.24)^2}{2}+\frac{q^2}{g*(0.24)}=13\;ft^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(6)\quad M_2=\frac{(4.97)^2}{2}+\frac{q^2}{g*(4.97)}=13\;ft^2&lt;/math&gt;

The M-y Diagram for this example is plotted below.  To develop the M-y Diagram, we plot the value of M as a function of depth with M on the x-axis and depth on the [[y-axis]] since this is more naturally conducive to visualizing the change in momentum with depth.  This example is a very basic hydraulic jump situation where the flow approaches at a supercritical depth, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and jumps to its subcritical conjugate depth, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in order to obtain the necessary energy to continue moving down the channel with the given [[Flow measurement|flow rate]], ''q''.

[[File:M-y Diagram.jpg|M-y Diagram]]&lt;br&gt;
Figure 6. M-y Diagram

===Explanation of diagram and what it represents===
The M-y Diagram is a [[graphical representation]] of the conservation of momentum and can be applied over a hydraulic jump to find the upstream and downstream depths.  We can see from the above example that the flow approaches supercritically at a depth of ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  There is a jump to the subcritical conjugate depth of ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; which is labeled as ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in Figure 6.  Figure 6 helps in visualizing how two depths can exist with the same momentum.

===Analysis of important M-y curve locations===
There are a few key locations on the [[Momentum–depth relationship in a rectangular channel#The M-y Diagram|M-y diagram]] which are labeled in Figure 6 above developed based on the information in Example 1.  The first location of interest is the critical point labeled with y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; in Figure 6.  The critical point represents the minimum value of the momentum function available for that particular flow per unit width, ''q''.  An increase in q would cause the M function to move to the right and slightly up, giving the flow access to more momentum at its critical point.  It follows that a decrease in the q value would move the M function down and to the left, decreasing the momentum available to the flow at its critical value.  This is shown graphically Figure 7 below.

[[File:M-y Diagram2.png|M-y diagram 2]]

Figure 7. Effect of increasing q on depth up- and down-stream of hydraulic jump

From Figure 7, it can also be seen what effect increasing the flow rate, ''q'', will have on the depth up- and down-stream of the jump.  Increasing the incoming flow rate (from q = 10&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s to 30&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s in Figure 7) will result in an increase in the supercritical approach depth and a decrease in the subcritical depth post-jump.  This can be seen in Figure 6 by the decrease in depth from y&lt;sub&gt;1,q=30&lt;/sub&gt; to y&lt;sub&gt;1,q=10&lt;/sub&gt; and the increase in depth between y&lt;sub&gt;2,q=30&lt;/sub&gt; and y&lt;sub&gt;2,q=10&lt;/sub&gt;.  From this analysis of the change in depth due to a change in flow rate, we can also imagine that the energy lost in a jump with a value of q = 10&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s would be different from that of a jump with q = 30&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s.  This is further discussed in Section 5.1.

==Calculations for typical parameters in simple hydraulic jumps in rectangular channels==

===Energy loss===
Although momentum is conserved throughout the hydraulic jump, the energy is not.  There is an initial loss of energy when the flow jumps from [[Supercritical flow|supercritical]] to subcritical depths.  The resulting loss of energy is equal to the change in specific energy across the jump and is given by the [[equation]] for ΔE below.  The equation below is based on the condition that y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are conjugate depths.
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E = E_1 - E_2 = \left(y_1 + \frac{q^2}{2g y_1^2}\right) - \left(y_2 + \frac{q^2}{2g y_2^2}\right) = \frac{(y_2 - y_1)^3}{4y_1 y_2}&lt;/math&gt;
When looking at the critical points on the M-y diagram and what their locations tell us about the nature of the hydraulic jump, we mentioned that an increase in q would affect the energy lost in the jump.  From Figure 7 we see that increasing the flow rate decreases the difference in the upstream and downstream depth of the jump (''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; – ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).  From this we can infer that if the momentum is held to be constant, there will be a decrease in the energy lost in the jump if the flow rate is increased.

The efficiency of the jump is determined by the [[dimensionless parameter]] E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; which tells us how much of the original energy is remaining after the jump is complete.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.most.gov.mm/techuni/media/CE_04016_chap8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;   The equation for the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] is given below and shows the heavy dependence that the efficiency has on the Froude number of the upstream flow.  Example 2 shows a sample calculation for energy loss and efficiency.
:&lt;math&gt;{E_2 \over E_1} = {(8Fr_1^2 + 1)^{3/2} - 4Fr_1^2 + 1 \over 8Fr_1^2(2 + Fr_1^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 2: Energy loss and efficiency===
Given:
:Rectangular Channel
:Velocity, ''v'' = 10 m/s
:Depth, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5 m
Find:
:Energy loss and efficiency across the hydraulic jump
Solution:
:&lt;math&gt;(1)\; F r_1=\frac{v}{\sqrt{gy}}=\frac{10[m/s]}{\sqrt{9.81[m/s^2]*0.5[m]}}=4.5&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(2)\; F r_1&gt;1\quad \text{(supercritical flow)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(3)\; y_2=\frac{y_1}{2}\left(\sqrt{1+8F r_1^2}-1\right)=\frac{0.5}{2}\left(\sqrt{1+8*4.5^2}-1\right)=2.94\;m&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(4)\; \Delta E=\frac{(y_2-y_1)^3}{4 y_1 y_2}=\frac{(2.94-0.5)^3}{4*2.94*0.5}=2.47\;m&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(5)\; \frac{E_2}{E_1}=\frac{(8 F r_1^2 + 1)^{3/2}-4 F r_1^2+1}{8 F r_1^2(2+F_1^2)}=\frac{(8*4.5^2+1)^{3/2}-4*4.5^2+1}{8*4.5^2(2+4.5^2)}=0.55&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(6)\; \% \text{ efficiency}=0.55*100=55\%\text{ efficient}\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Length of hydraulic jump===
Length of a hydraulic jump is often hard to measure in the field and during [[laboratory]] investigations due to the sudden changes in surface turbulence, in addition to the formation of roller and eddies.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-387-30174-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The length of a hydraulic jump is often an important factor to know when considering the design of structures like [[settling basin]]s.  The equation derived for length is based on experimental data, and relates the length to the upstream Froude number.
:&lt;math&gt;(1)\; L = 220 \times y_1 \times \tanh\frac{Fr_1 - 1}{22}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Willi H. Hager|Hager, W.H.]] 1992. Energy Dissipators and Hydraulic Jump. Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht, The Netherlands.  {{ISBN|0-7923-1508-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example 3: Length calculation===
Given:
:Use data from Example 2
Find:
:Length of jump
Solution:
:&lt;math&gt;(2)\; L=220*0.5*\tanh\left(\frac{4.5-1}{22}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(3)\; \tanh(z)=\frac{e^z-e^{-z}}{e^z+e^{-z}}\qquad\text{if necessary, this is an alternate way to calculate }\tanh(z)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(4)\; z=\frac{4.5-1}{22}=0.1591&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(5)\; \tanh(z)=0.1578&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(6)\; L=220*0.5*0.1578=17.4\;m&lt;/math&gt;

===Height of hydraulic jump===
The height of the hydraulic jump, similar to length, is useful to know when designing [[waterway]] structures like settling basins or [[spillway]]s.  The height of the hydraulic jump is simply the difference in flow depths prior to and after the hydraulic jump.  The height can be determined using the Froude number and upstream energy.

Equations:
:&lt;math&gt;(1)\; h_j=y_2-y_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(2)\; y_2=\frac{y_1}{2}\left(\sqrt{1+8 F r_1^2}-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;
Substitute ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equation into jump height equation:
:&lt;math&gt;(3)\; h_j=\frac{y_1}{2}\left(\sqrt{1+8 F r_1^2}-1\right)-y_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(4)\; h_j=\frac{y_1 \sqrt{1+8 F r_1^2} - 3 y_1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 4: Height calculation===
Given:
:Use data from Example 2
Find:
:Height of jump
Solution:
:&lt;math&gt;(5)\; h_j=\frac{y_1 \sqrt{1+8 F r_1^2} - 3 y_1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(6)\; h_j=\frac{0.5\sqrt{1+8(4.5)^2}-(3*0.5)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(7)\; h_j=2.4\;m&lt;/math&gt;

== Types of jumps ==
A hydraulic jump can assume several distinct forms depending on the approach [[Froude number]], Fr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Chow"&gt;Chow, V. T. (1959). Open-Channel Hydraulics, McGraw-Hill, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these types has unique flow patterns and flow characteristics, such as the strength and formation of rollers and eddies, that help to determine the amount of energy dissipation that will occur in the jump. The following descriptions of jump types are based on specific ranges of [[Froude number]]s, but it should be noted that these ranges are not precise and that overlap can occur near the endpoints.

=== Weak jump (1 &lt; Fr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 2.5) ===

For the case when 1 &lt; Fr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1.7, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are approximately equal and only a very small jump occurs.&lt;ref name="Chow"/&gt; In this range, the water surface shows slight undulations and because of this, jumps in this range are sometimes known as undular jumps. These surface riffles generally result in very little [[energy dissipation]]. As Fr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; approaches 1.7, a number of small rollers begin to form at the water surface at the jump location, but in general, the downstream water surface remains relatively smooth. Between 1.7 &lt; Fr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 2.5, the velocity remains fairly uniform on either side of the jump and energy loss is low.&lt;ref name="Chow"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Chaudhry "&gt;Chaudhry, M. H. (2008). Open-Channel Flow, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Akan "&gt;Akan, A. O. (2006). Open Channel Hydraulics, Elsevier Ltd., Burlington, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oscillating jump (2.5 &lt; Fr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 4.5) ===

An oscillating jump can occur when 2.5 &lt; Fr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 4.5. During this jump, the jet of water at the entrance of the jump (supercritical) fluctuates from the bottom of the channel to the top of the channel at an irregular period. [[Turbulence]] created from this jet can be near the channel bottom at one instant and then suddenly transition to the water surface. This [[oscillation]] of the jet causes irregular waves to form, which can propagate for long distances downstream of the jump, potentially causing damage and degradation of the channel banks.&lt;ref name="Chow"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Chaudhry "/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Akan "/&gt;

=== Steady Jump (4.5 &lt; Fr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 9) ===

When the [[Froude number]] falls into this range, the jump forms steadily and at the same location. In a steady jump, turbulence is confined within the jump and the location of the jump is the least susceptible to downstream flow conditions out of the four major types of jumps. Steady jumps are generally well-balanced and the [[energy dissipation]] is usually considerable (45-70%).&lt;ref name="Chow"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Chaudhry "/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Akan "/&gt;

=== Strong jump (Fr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 9) ===

There is a large difference in [[Hydraulic jumps in rectangular channels#Conjugate depths relationships|conjugate depths]] in a strong jump. Strong jumps are characterized by a jump action that is very rough resulting in a high [[energy dissipation]] rate. At irregular intervals, slugs of water can be seen rolling down the front of the jump face. These slugs enter the high-velocity, [[Supercritical flow|supercritical]] jet and cause the formation of additional waves in the jump. [[Energy dissipation]] in strong jumps can reach up to 85%.&lt;ref name="Chow"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Chaudhry "/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Akan "/&gt;

== Jump location ==
In general, a [[hydraulic jump]] is formed at a location where the upstream and downstream flow depths satisfy the [[Hydraulic jumps in rectangular channels#Conjugate depths relationships|conjugate depth]] equation. However, there can be conditions in a channel, such as downstream controls, that can alter where the conjugate depths form. [[Tailwater]] depth can play a very influential role on where the jump will occur in the channel, and changes in this depth can shift the jump either upstream or downstream. Figure 6 contains three scenarios of [[tailwater]] elevations (y&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;): y&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;  is equal to the conjugate depth (y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of the upstream flow depth (y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;),  y&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;  is less than the conjugate depth (y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of the upstream flow depth (y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), and y&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;  is greater than the conjugate depth (y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of the upstream flow depth (y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). The upstream depth (y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) in all three cases is controlled by a [[sluice gate]] and remains constant. Its corresponding conjugate depth (y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is shown by the dashed line in each of the scenarios. 
 
[[File:Effect of Tailwater Elevation on Jump Location.png|thumb|center|275px|alt=Figure 6: Effect of Tailwater Elevation on Jump Location|'''Figure 6: Effect of Tailwater Elevation on Jump Location''']]

In the first situation (Scenario A), the jump is formed right at the apron, as it would if there was no downstream control. However, in the next scenario (Scenario B), the downstream [[tailwater]] depth has some control imposed on it such that it is less than the conjugate to y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case, the jump travels downstream and initiates at a point where the upstream flow depth (y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;’) has risen to the conjugate of the new downstream [[tailwater]] depth (y&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;). This rise from y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;’ is caused by [[Friction|frictional resistance]] in the channel; and velocity decrease, the depth increase. In this image, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;’ and y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;’ represent the conjugate depths of the hydraulic jump where y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;’ assumes the depth of y&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;. In contrast, in the third setup (Scenario C), there is a downstream control that forces the [[tailwater]] elevation to a depth above the original conjugate depth. Here, y&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than the required depth so the jump is pushed upstream. In this scenario, the [[sluice gate]] inhibits the movement of the jump upstream so that the upstream conjugate cannot be attained. This leads to a situation known as a submerged or drowned hydraulic jump. These scenarios demonstrate how influential the role of tailwater is to jump formation and location.&lt;ref name=" Chaudhry "/&gt;

==Classifications of hydraulic jumps==

===Classification by Froude number===
Table 1. Hydraulic Jump Classifications&lt;ref name="text"&gt;[White, Frank M. (6th edition). Fluid Mechanics. McGraw Hill Inc. {{ISBN|0-07-293844-7}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Froude number vs ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;===
To help visualize the relationship of the upstream Froude number and the flow depth downstream of the hydraulic jump, it is helpful to plot y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; versus the upstream Froude Number, Fr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. (Figure 8) The value of y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a ratio of depths that represent a dimensionless jump height; for example, if y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 2, then the jump doubles the depth of flow.  As the upstream Froude Number increases (moves toward more supercritical flow), the ratio of the downstream depth to the upstream depth also increases, and the graph verifies the existence of a positive [[linear relationship]] between the dimensionless jump height and the upstream Froude Number.  This implies that a more supercritical upstream flow, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, will produce a larger downstream depth, y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and thus a larger jump.  The relationship given in Figure 8 below was developed for a horizontal, rectangular channel with q = 10&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s.  This graph is limited by the following due to the nature of a hydraulic jump:

::1.  y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1: depth increases over the jump so that y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

::2.  Fr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1: downstream flow must be subcritical

::3.  Fr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1: upstream flow must be supercritical

Table 2 shows the calculated values used to develop Figure 8.  The values associated with a y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.5&amp;nbsp;ft are not valid for use since they violate the above limits.  The cusp of the above limits is reached at the critical depth, y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, where all of these values are equal to 1.  There will not, however, be a hydraulic jump in the situation where y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[File:Filling station off the A40 roundabout - geograph.org.uk - 1169731.jpg|thumb|UK filling stations collected more than £27 billion in fuel duty in 2014-15.]]
'''Hydrocarbon Oil Duty''' (also '''fuel duty''' and '''fuel tax''') is a [[fuel tax]] levied on some fuels used by most [[road]] [[motor vehicle]]s in the [[United Kingdom]]; with exceptions for [[Public transport bus service|local bus services]], some farm and [[Heavy equipment (construction)|construction vehicles]] and [[aviation]], which pay reduced or no fuel duty.

The government revenue from fuel duty was £27.1 billion for the financial year 2014-2015.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} This is an increase in cash terms in comparison to 2013-2014 but now only represents 1.5% of GDP. This is in contrast to the start of the 2000s when it was 2.3% of GDP.  A further £3.9 billion is raised from the [[Value-added tax (United Kingdom)|VAT]] on the duty, contributing some 3.5 per cent of total [[Economy of the United Kingdom|UK tax revenues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=United Kingdom National Accounts: The Blue Book |year=2010 |publisher=Office for National Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fuel Price Escalator]], which was introduced in 1993 was abandoned after the disruptive [[Fuel protests in the United Kingdom|fuel tax protests of 2000]].

The [[Finance Act 1908]] introduced a petrol duty in the UK, with the rate being set at 3[[old pence|d]] (£0.013) per [[imperial gallon|UK gallon]], bringing the price of a typical UK gallon to 1[[shilling|s]] 1½d ({{Inflation|UK|0.065|1908|r=2|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}&lt;ref name=politicescouk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/fuel-duties|title=Fuel duties|work=Politics.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was then abolished by the [[Finance Act 1919]] after several years of steady petrol price rises and replaced by [[vehicle excise duty|vehicle taxation]], and the [[tax disc]] based on horsepower,&lt;ref name=politicescouk/&gt; after which the cost of petrol was about 4s{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} ({{Inflation|UK|0.2|1919|r=2|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} per UK gallon.

In 1928, following market reductions in the cost of a UK gallon of fuel to about 1s 2½d ({{Inflation|UK|0.0604|1928|r=2|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} the Government introduced a tax of 4d (£0.017) per UK gallon&lt;ref name=politicescouk/&gt; bringing the cost of a UK gallon of petrol to 1s 6¾d{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} ({{Inflation|UK|0.078|1928|r=2|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}

In the 1993 Budget during the [[Second Major ministry|Major ministry]], [[Norman Lamont, Baron Lamont of Lerwick|Norman Lamont]] introduced a 10p rise and also a [[Fuel Price Escalator]] whereby the cost of fuel would be increased annually by 3 per cent above inflation in future years; the [[Petroleum Revenue Tax]] was reduced in the same budget and later abolished. [[Kenneth Clarke]], the new chancellor, increased the escalator to 5p in November of that year. These increases were introduced at a time of considerable change in government transport policy, and followed [[Road protest in the United Kingdom|major UK road protests]], including the [[M11 link road protest]] and the protest at [[Twyford Down]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/gummer-denies-the-great-car-economy-1430379.html|title=Gummer denies the 'great car economy'|work=The Independent|date=1994-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The escalator was increased in 6p per year in 1997 by [[Gordon Brown]], chancellor for the new [[Blair ministry]].

The escalator was effectively cancelled by the [[Brown ministry]] follow severe disruption caused by the [[Fuel protests in the United Kingdom|fuel tax protests in 2000]]. Since that time more cautious increases have been applied.&lt;ref name=politicescouk/&gt; A planned 3.02p/litre rise which was confirmed by the [[2012 United Kingdom budget]] to come into effect on 1 August 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17458423|title=Budget 2012: Fuel duty increase gets go-ahead|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; was later deferred until 1 January 2013 at short notice. The last increase in Fuel duty occurred in 2010. Taxation currently accounts for 75% of the total price of fuel at 99.7ppl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/cars/article-3399800/LEE-BOYCE-Chancellor-bit-pickle-motorists-come-March-oil-prices-continue-fall.html|title = The Chancellor could find himself in a bit of pickle...|publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European comparisons==
The UK average petrol price as of 11 January 2016 is £1.01 per litre. This is slightly above the European average but is 30p lower than the peak in 2014. With declining oil prices, it has been suggested petrol could fall to 86.9p per litre if oil prices fall to $10 a barrel. Average diesel prices are currently £1.03 per litre. The minimum petrol price available is 99.7p and £1.03 for diesel. The minimum across Europe is 87.9.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.petrolprices.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aviation===

[[Avgas]], used some smaller planes, was taxed at half the rate of road petrol for all users until October 2008, when the reduced rate was limited to commercial flying.

Until 31 October 2008 all avtur, which is an unmarked type of kerosene, was fully rebated to a nil rate of duty.

Changes introduced on 1 November 2008 The expiry of the derogation gave rise to the requirement to charge the full rate of duty on fuel used for private pleasure-flying and led to changes in the treatment of both avtur and avgas. Unleaded petrol used in private pleasure-flying is not affected as it was already subject to duty at the full rate as used in road vehicles.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buses===
{{main|Bus Service Operators Grant}}
The [[Bus Service Operators Grant]] provides a [[fuel duty rebate]] to local bus service operators (but not for express coach which receives no rebate).  As of April 2010 the rebate was £0.43 for diesel, £0.2360 for road fuel gas other than natural gas and 100% for biodiesel and bioethanol. Additional rebates are available for increasing fuel efficiency, low carbon emission vehicles and equipping vehicles with Smartcards and GPS tracking equipment.&lt;ref name=rates&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/regional/buses/busgrants/bsog/rates.pdf |title=Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) rates in England |publisher=Department for Transport |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122085143/http://dft.gov.uk/pgr/regional/buses/busgrants/bsog/rates.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 it was proposed that long-distance scheduled coach services should receive the rebate in return for offering half-price fares to older and disabled passengers.&lt;ref name=cm200102&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmtlgr/828/82804.htm|title=II.

The '''Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission''' (IOGCC), formerly the '''Interstate Oil Compact Commission''', is a [[United States]] organization, representing the [[governor (United States)|governors]] of 31 member and seven associate [[U.S. state|states]], that works to ensure the nation's [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] resources are conserved and utilized to their maximum potential while protecting health, safety and the environment.&lt;ref name=Baca&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baca|first1=Marie C.|title=Some Appointees to Oil and Gas Commission Are Industry Execs, Lobbyists|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/some-appointees-to-oil-and-gas-commission-are-industry-execs-lobbyists|accessdate=23 September 2014|work=Our Investigations|publisher=ProPublica|date=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1935, it is the oldest and largest [[interstate compact]] in the nation.&lt;ref name=DailyGPI&gt;{{cite news|title=New Oklahoma Governor to Head IOGCC|url=http://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/85695-new-oklahoma-governor-to-head-iogcc|accessdate=23 September 2014|work=Daily GPI|publisher=Natural Gas Intelligence|date=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the early days of oil exploration, drilling was governed by the ''[[law of capture]]'', which states that the owner of land on which a well resides has the right to any oil from that well even if it was drained from the land of his neighbors. This provided an incentive for each land owner to extract the oil as fast as possible.&lt;ref name=Economic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lovejoy|first1=Wallace F.|last2=Homan|first2=Paul T.|title=Economic aspects of oil conservation regulation| date=2011| publisher=Taylor and Francis| location=Hoboken|isbn=9781135985462}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}} Each state tried to regulate its own oil by such measures as proration, the limiting of production to some fraction of capacity; but then two great oil fields, the [[Oklahoma City Oil Field]] and the [[East Texas Oil Field]], were discovered. This, along with the [[Great Depression]], led to much waste and very low prices, with a catastrophic effect on the industry. The problems were large enough that the states recognized the need for cooperation.&lt;ref name=Economic/&gt;{{rp|33&amp;ndash;34}}

The compact was formed in 1935 as the ''Interstate Compact to Conserve Gas and Oil''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/74th-congress/session-1/c74s1ch781.pdf Joint resolution consenting to an interstate oil compact to conserve oil and gas]'' '''Pub. Res., No. 64 (1935);''' 74TH CONGRESS. SESS. I. CHS. 780, 781. &lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the compact was to eliminate the glut of oil and raise prices for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Leach, Richard H. "[https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/oklrv10&amp;id=284&amp;collection=journals&amp;index= The Interstate Oil Compact: A Study in Success.]" ''Okla. L. Rev.'' 10 (1957): 274.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[interstate compact]] was seen as an alternative to direct federal regulation that would allow oil producing states to retain more control.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Blakely M. "[https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/mislj17&amp;section=38 The Interstate Compact to Conserve Oil and Gas: An Experiement in Co-Operative State Production Control.]" ''Miss. LJ'' 17 (1945): 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] occupied wells in Oklahoma and Texas in 1931&amp;ndash;1932, an Oil States Advisory Committee drafted the Thomas-McKeon Bill, which proposed an interstate oil compact and a Federal Interstate Oil Board to recommend quotas. However, the bill was abandoned after oil industry representatives withdrew their support.&lt;ref name=Economic/&gt;{{rp|37&amp;ndash;38}}&lt;ref name=Nash&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nash|first1=Gerald D.|title=United States Oil Policy, 1890–1964: Business and Government in Twentieth Century America|date=1968|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=9780822975748}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|126}} From 1933 to 1935, oil was regulated under the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] and the Petroleum Code, which in effect left production control in the hands of industry representatives, with no representation for the states.&lt;ref name=Economic/&gt;{{rp|38}} The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] found these regulations unconstitutional in 1935,&lt;ref name=Finders&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daintith|first1=Terence|title=Finders keepers? how the law of capture shaped the world oil industry|date=2010|publisher=RFF Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9781936331765}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|375}} and the idea of an interstate compact was revived. On December 3, 1934, Oklahoma Governor-elect [[E. W. Marland]] met with the governors of Kansas and Texas to discuss an interstate compact. This led to the drafting of the Interstate Compact to Conserve Oil and Gas, which was ratified by Congress on August 27, 1935.&lt;ref name=Nash/&gt;{{rp|150&amp;ndash;151}} At first, Congress ratified it for only two years at a time, then four years, and finally the compact was made permanent in 1979.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zimmerman |first1=Joseph F.| title=Interstate cooperation : compacts and administrative agreements| date=2002| publisher=Praeger| location=Westport, Conn.| isbn=9780275977566}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76}}

Some economic historians have described the regulation of oil output under the compact as an example of a [[price fixing]] cartel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Libecap |first=Gary D. |author-link=Gary Libecap|date=1989 |title= The Political Economy of Crude Oil Cartelization in the United States, 1933-1972| jstor= 2122740| journal =The Journal of Economic History |volume=49| issue=4 |pages=833–855}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production controls of the IOGCC and the [[Texas Railroad Commission]] have been cited as precursors to the establishment of [[OPEC]]'s caps on member state oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url= http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/249314680| title=How cartels endure and how they fail: studies of industrial collusion| author-link=Peter Grossman| last=Grossman| first=Peter Z| date=2004| page=218|publisher=Elgar| isbn=1858988306| location=Cheltenham |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated purpose of the compact was "conserve oil and gas by the prevention of physical waste thereof from any cause".&lt;ref name=charter&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter|url=http://iogcc.publishpath.com/charter|publisher=IOGCC|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; States that ratified the compact agreed to enact legislation for this purpose. Article VI of the compact constituted "The Interstate Oil Compact Commission," renamed as the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission in 1991, and its duty was to make recommendations for preventing the physical waste of gas and oil.&lt;ref name=Finders/&gt;&lt;ref name=charter/&gt;

==Organizational structure==
[[File:Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission members map.svg|thumb|{{legend|#346733|Member states}}{{legend|#C6DEBD|Associate states}}]]
Initially the commission had six members: [[Colorado]], [[Illinois]], [[Kansas]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Texas]]. It now has 31 member states, 7 associate states and 10 international affiliates (including 7 Canadian provinces and territories).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Member states|url=http://iogcc.ok.gov/member-states|publisher=IOGCC|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governor of each member state appoints an official representative who can vote on policy recommendations, and any number of associate representatives who can vote in their place if the official representative is not available. The list of members can be found on the IOGCC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iogcc.ok.gov/member-states|title=Member States|publisher=IOGCC|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many representatives are state regulators overseeing gas and drilling, but as of 2010 at least seven were industry executives and lobbyists.&lt;ref name=lobbyists&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baca|first1=Marie C.|title=Some Appointees to Oil and Gas Commission Are Industry Execs, Lobbyists|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/some-appointees-to-oil-and-gas-commission-are-industry-execs-lobbyists|accessdate=24 September 2014|work=ProPublica|date=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The commission meets biannually, but much of its work occurs in small committee meetings throughout the year.&lt;ref name=lobbyists/&gt; To govern operations, it has steering, finance, resolutions and nominating committees. Other committees are Energy Resources, Research and Technology; Environment and Safety; International; Public Lands; Public Outreach; and State Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committees and Workgroups|url=http://iogcc.publishpath.com/committees-and-workgroups|website=What We Do|publisher=IOGCC|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transparency and accountability===
The IOGCC is governed by the compact and several bylaws. The compact did not provide for any resources to support IOGCC; a later bylaw stipulated that its expenses would be paid "from voluntary contributions from the member states and other sources of revenue approved by the Commission". These sources, which include federal grants, have proved to be enough to allow the commission to function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Broun |first1=Caroline N.|first2=Michael L. |last2=Buenger |title=The evolving use and the changing role of interstate compacts : a practitioner's guide|date=2006|publisher=Administrative Law Section, American Bar Association|location=Chicago, Ill.|isbn=9781590316436}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|144}} IOGCC uses an Oklahoma government email address and domain but it is not a state, not a [[List of federal agencies in the United States|federal agency]] and does not have to register to lobby the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desmogblog.com/2016/04/11/iogcc-oil-gas-fracking-stealth-lobby DESMOG: Introducing IOGCC: The Most Powerful Oil and Gas Lobby]&lt;/ref&gt; A plethora of information is available but relatively little of it has come directly from the organization itself. IOGCC claims an exemption from the [[Open Public Records Act]] and has removed a provision within its by-laws that formerly said its records are open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eenews.net/stories/1059968679 Energy Wire: Hydraulic Fracturing - Public disclosure database kept private]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-horn/iogcc-the-most-powerful-o_b_9664710.html Huffington Post: IOGCC: The Most Powerful Oil and Gas Lobby You’ve Never Heard Of]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
To identify best practices, IOGCC surveys member states and assesses their activities. It catalogues innovative programs and shares the information with states, and it hosts biannual meetings that draw together representatives from the government, the oil industry and environmentalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Do|url=http://iogcc.ok.gov/what-we-do|publisher=IOGCC|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOGCC is an advocate for states' rights, arguing that state regulation is more effective than "one size fits all" federal regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=States' Rights|url=http://iogcc.ok.gov/states-rights|website=Issues|publisher=IOGCC|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as creating reports, it creates model statutes as a guide for legislation by states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Model Statutes|url=http://iogcc.ok.gov/model-statutes|website=Issues|publisher=IOGCC|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues that IOGCC has worked on include [[Energy policy of the United States|national energy policy]], [[carbon sequestration]], [[environmental stewardship]], [[hydraulic fracturing]] and [[produced water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Issues|url=http://iogcc.ok.gov/issues|publisher=IOGCC|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Price fixing===
In the 1930s and 1940s, the commission functioned as a [[price fixing]] cartel. According to the legal scholar Blakely Murphy, the commission operated under the guise resource conservation but primarily existed to protect the interests of oil producers.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Blakely M. "[https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/tulr22&amp;id=412&amp;collection=journals&amp;index= Administrative Mechanism of the Interstate Compact to Conserve Oil and Gas: The Interstate Oil Compact Commission, 1935-1948]." ''Tul. L. Rev.'' 22 (1947): 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon sequestration===
A large part of the human contribution to [[global warming]] is from the emission of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a result of burning [[fossil fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Houghton|editor1-first=J.T.|editor2-first=Y. |editor2-last=Ding |editor3-first=D.

Phase I concluded that the states had the knowledge and experience to regulate sequestration safely. In phase II, started in 2006, the task force prepared a report that included a model statute for the states with explanations on how to implement it.&lt;ref name=Curtiss/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Storage: A Legal and Regulatory Guide for States |publisher=IOGCC |date=December 2007 |url=http://iogcc.publishpath.com/Websites/iogcc/pdfs/Road-to-a-Greener-Energy-Future.pdf |accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
The IOGCC has three awards. The E. W. Marland Award, established in 1994, recognizes an outstanding state legislator. The Warwick Downing Award, established in 2005, recognizes an individual outside state governments who has made an outstanding contribution to the IOGCC. The highest honor, established in 2001, is the Chairman's Stewardship Award for exemplary efforts in environmental stewardship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Award Programs|url=http://iogcc.ok.gov/award-programs|website=What We Do|publisher=IOGCC|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This award has four categories: Environmental Partnership (for partnerships with industry led by non-industry organizations); Energy Education; Small Company and Large Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chairman's Stewardship Awards 2012|url=http://iogcc.ok.gov/Websites/iogcc/images/Chairman_Stewardship/CS_Award_Booklet_Final_2012.pdf|publisher=IOGCC|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kahl''' plant was the first [[nuclear power]] plant ever to be built in Germany.  It was located in [[Karlstein am Main]] and was an (at the time) experimental [[boiling water reactor]].  It was built by [[General Electric]] and supplied by [[Siemens]]. At the end of 2008, the demolition works had been finished.

The station was the subject of the 1961 short documentary film, ''[[Kahl (film)|Kahl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.german-films.de/filmarchive/browse-archive/view/detail/mode/oscar_doc/film/kahl/|title=KAHL|work=German Films Service|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Keelung''' ([[Standard Mandarin]] [[Hànyǔ Pīnyīn|Pīnyīn]]: ''Jīlóng''; [[Hokkien]] [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī|POJ]]: ''Ke-lâng''), officially known as '''Keelung City''', is a major port city situated in the northeastern part of [[Taiwan]]. It borders [[New Taipei]] with which it forms the [[Taipei–Keelung metropolitan area]], along with Taipei itself. Nicknamed the ''Rainy Port'' for its frequent rain and maritime role, the city is Taiwan's second largest [[seaport]] (after [[Kaohsiung]]).

== Name ==
According to early Chinese accounts, this northern coastal area was originally called ''Pak-kang'' ({{zh|c=北港|poj=Pak-káng}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=William |authorlink=William Campbell (missionary) |title=Formosa under the Dutch: described from contemporary records, with explanatory notes and a bibliography of the island |year=1903 |publisher=Kegan Paul |location=London |oclc=644323041 |ref=harv |chapter=Explanatory Notes |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/formosaunderdut01campgoog#page/n554/mode/2up |pages=538–557}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century, the city was known to the Western world as '''Kelung''',&lt;ref&gt;for example: {{cite book |last=Smith |first=D. Warres |title=European settlements in the Far East: China, Japan, Corea, Indo-China, Straits Settlements, Malay States, Siam, Netherlands, India, Borneo, the Philippines etc. |publisher=S. Low, Marston &amp; company |year=1900 |url=https://archive.org/stream/europeansettlem00warrgoog#page/n74/mode/2up |page=38 |ol=6905314M |oclc=3110223 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the variants ''Kiloung'', ''Kilang'' and ''Keelung''.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|loc=Index p.20}} In his 1903 general history of Taiwan, US Consul to Formosa (1898–1904) [[James W. Davidson]] related that "Kelung" was among the few well-known names, thus warranting no alternate [[Romanization of Japanese|Japanese romanization]].{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=iii}}

However, the Taiwanese people have long called the city ''Kelang'' ({{zh|poj=Ke-lâng/Koe-lâng|t=雞籠|l=rooster cage" or "hencoop}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klcg.gov.tw/en/01/01_2.jsp |title=Welcome to Keelung City: The Beginning |publisher=Keelung City Government |accessdate=2010-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926220102/http://www.klcg.gov.tw/en/01/01_2.jsp |archivedate=26 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;). It has been proposed that this name was derived from the local mountain that took the shape of a rooster cage. However, it is more probable that the name was derived from the first inhabitants of the region, as are the names of many other Taiwanese cities. In this case, the [[Ketagalan people]] were the first inhabitants, and early Han settlers probably approximated "Ketagalan" with ''Ke-lâng'' ([[Hokkien]] phonetics).

In 1875, during the late [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing era]], a new official name was given ({{zh|c=基隆|p=Jīlóng|l=base prosperous}}).&lt;ref name="KCG-Qing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klcg.gov.tw/en/01/01_2_3.jsp |title=Ching Dynasty |publisher=Keelung City Government |accessdate=2010-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526162424/http://www.klcg.gov.tw/en/01/01_2_3.jsp |archivedate=26 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], probably the working language of Chinese government at the time, both the old and new names were likely pronounced ''Kīlóng'' (hence "Keelung").

Under [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] (1895–1945), the city was also known to the west by the Japanese romanization '''Kīrun''' (also written as ''Kirun'' or ''Kiirun''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Terry|first=Thomas Philip |title=Terry's Japanese Empire |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|year=1914 |url=https://archive.org/stream/terrysjapaneseem00terr#page/774/mode/2up |page=774 |oclc=51414323 |ol=18847607M |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In [[Standard Chinese]], which became the official language of Taiwan after its handover to the Republic of China, the newer name is read '''Jīlóng''' (the shift from initial ''K'' to ''J'' is a recent development in the Beijing dialect, see [[Old Mandarin]]). However, the locals continue to call the city '''Ke-lâng''' across the changes in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{R:nan:tdj|n=35577|poj=koe-lâng|hj=基隆|v=1|p=466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{holodict|35351|e=基隆市}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Map of Formosa Coal Resources 美國人所繪福爾摩沙-臺灣基隆以東煤礦分布.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Keelung in 1856.]]

Keelung was first inhabited by the [[Ketagalan people|Ketagalan]], a tribe of [[Taiwanese aborigine]]. The [[Spanish expedition to Formosa]] in the early 17th century was its first contact with the West; by 1624 the Spanish had built [[San Salvador de Quelung]], a fort in Keelung serving as an outpost of the [[Manila]]-based [[Spanish East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Altares|first1=Guillermo|title=Una excavación aporta una nueva visión de la colonización de Asia|url=http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2016/11/12/actualidad/1478959382_298788.html|accessdate=November 13, 2016|language=es|newspaper=El País|date=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish ruled it as a part of [[Spanish Formosa]]. From 1642 to 1661 and 1663–1668, Keelung was under [[Netherlands|Dutch]] control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Twitchett|first=Denis Crispin|title=The Cambridge history of China, Volume 2; Volume 8|publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1978 |page=46 |isbn=9780521243339|oclc = 613665518}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mingdyn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klcg.gov.tw/en/01/01_2_2.jsp |title=Ming Dynasty and Cheng Cheng kung's Era |publisher=Keelung City Government |accessdate=2010-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525181927/http://www.klcg.gov.tw/en/01/01_2_2.jsp |archivedate=25 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dutch East India Company]] took over the Spanish Fort San Salvador at [[Santissima Trinidad (Taiwan)|Santissima Trinidad]]. They reduced its size and renamed it Fort Noort-Hollant.&lt;ref name="mingdyn" /&gt; The Dutch had three more minor fortifications in Keelung and also a little school and a preacher.

([[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]]), the crew of the Keelung forts fled to the Dutch trading post in Japan. The Dutch came back in 1663 and re-occupied and strengthened their earlier forts. However, trade with Qing China through Keelung was not what they hoped it would be and, in 1668, they left after getting harassed by aboriginals.{{sfnp|Shepherd|1993|p=95}}

====First Opium War====
{{main|First Opium War|Nerbudda incident}}
Given the strategic and commercial value of Taiwan, there were British suggestions in 1840 and 1841 to seize the island.&lt;ref name="Tsai2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shih-Shan Henry Tsai|title=Maritime Taiwan: Historical Encounters with the East and the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUbfBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-46517-1|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonard H.

The brig ''Ann'' also became shipwrecked in March 1842. Most of the crew were Indian [[lascar]]s. Survivors from both ships were transferred by authorities to the capital Tainan. The Taiwan Qing commanders, Ta-hung-ah and Yao Ying, filed a disingenuous report to the emperor, claiming to have defended against an attack from the Keelung fort. In October 1841, [[HMS Nimrod (1828)|HMS ''Nimrod'']] sailed to Keelung to search for the ''Nerbudda'' survivors, but after Captain Joseph Pearse found out that they were sent south for imprisonment, he ordered the bombardment of the harbour and destroyed 27 sets of cannon before returning to Hong Kong. Most of the survivors—over 130 from the ''Nerbudda'' and 54 from the ''Ann''—were [[Nerbudda incident|executed in Tainan]] in August 1842.&lt;ref name="Tsai2014" /&gt;

In 1863, the Qing Empire opened up Keelung as a trading port and the city enjoyed rapid development due to the abundant commodities such as placer gold and high quality coal found in the drainage area of [[Keelung River]]. In 1875, [[Taipeh Prefecture]] was created and included Keelung. In 1878, Keelung was formed into a ''ting'' or sub-prefecture.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=211}} Around the same time, the name was changed from ''Ke-lang'' ({{zh|t=雞籠廳|labels=no}}) to ''Kilong'' ({{zh|c=基隆廳|labels=no}}), which means "rich and prosperous land".&lt;ref name=KCG-Qing /&gt;

====Sino-French War====
{{main|Sino-French War|Keelung Campaign}}
During the Sino-French War (1884–85), the French attempted an invasion of Taiwan during the Keelung Campaign. [[Liu Mingchuan]], who led the defence of Taiwan, recruited Aboriginals to serve alongside the Chinese soldiers in fighting against the French of Colonel [[Jacques Duchesne]]'s Formosa Expeditionary Corps. The French were defeated at the [[Battle of Tamsui]] and the Qing forces pinned the French down at Keelung in an eight-month-long campaign before the French withdrew.

===Empire of Japan===
A systematic city development started during the Japanese Era, after the 1895 [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], which handed all Taiwan over to Japan. A five-phase construction of Keelung Harbor was initiated, and in by 1916 trade volume had exceeded even those of Tamsui and Kaohsiung Harbors to become one of the major commercial harbors of Taiwan.&lt;ref name="KCG-JR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klcg.gov.tw/en/01/01_2_4.jsp |title=Japanese Occupation |publisher=Keelung City Government |accessdate=2010-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524093925/http://www.klcg.gov.tw/en/01/01_2_4.jsp |archivedate=24 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keelung was governed as {{nihongo|Kīrun Town|基隆街}}, Kīrun District, [[Taihoku Prefecture]] in 1920 and was upgraded to a city in 1924.&lt;ref name="KCG-JR" /&gt; The [[Pacific War]] broke out in 1941, and Keelung became one of the first targets of Allied bombers and was nearly destroyed as a result.&lt;ref name="KCG-JR" /&gt;

===Republic of China===
After the [[Retrocession Day|withdrawal of the Japanese, Taiwan became part of the Republic of China (ROC)]] in October 1945, Keelung was established as a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] of [[Taiwan Province]]. The [[Keelung City Government]] worked with the harbor bureau to rebuild the city and the harbor and in 1984, the harbor became the 7th largest container harbor in the world.&lt;ref name=KCG-ROC /&gt;

==Geography==
Keelung City is located in the northern part of Taiwan Island. It occupies an area of {{convert|132.76|km2|abbr=on}} and is separated from its neighboring county by mountains in the east, west and south. The northern part of the city faces the ocean and is a great deep water harbor since early times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klcg.gov.tw/en/01/01_1.jsp|title=Introduction|publisher=Keelung City Government|accessdate=17 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120415/http://www.klcg.gov.tw/en/01/01_1.jsp|archivedate=26 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Keelung has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa'') with a yearly rainfall average upwards of {{convert|3700|mm|0}}. It has long been noted as one of the wettest and gloomiest cities in the world; the effect is related to the [[Kuroshio Current]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=James W. |authorlink=James W.

However its location on northern mountain slopes means that due to [[orographic lift]], rainfall is heavier during fall and winter, the latter during which a northeasterly flow prevails. During summer, southwesterly winds dominate and thus there is a slight [[rain shadow effect]]. Fog is most serious during winter and spring, when relative humidity levels are also highest.

A green box, stretched in the direction perpendicular to the METATOY, appears bent into a hyperbola when seen through the METATOY. A close-up view of the METATOY can be seen in the following picture.]]
A '''METATOY''' is a sheet, formed by a two-dimensional array of small, telescopic optical components, that switches the path of transmitted light rays.  METATOY is an acronym for "'''meta'''ma'''t'''erial f'''o'''r ra'''y'''s", representing a number of analogies with [[metamaterial]]s; METATOYs even satisfy a few definitions of metamaterials, but are certainly not metamaterials in the usual sense.  When seen from a distance, the view through each individual telescopic optical component acts as one pixel of the view through the METATOY as a whole.  In the simplest case, the individual optical components are all identical; the METATOY then behaves like a homogeneous, but pixellated, window that can have very unusual optical properties (see the picture of the view through a METATOY).

METATOYs are usually treated within the framework of [[geometrical optics]]; the light-ray-direction change performed by a METATOY is described by a [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] of the direction of any incoming light ray onto the corresponding direction of the outgoing ray.  The light-ray-direction mappings can be very general. METATOYs can even create pixellated light-ray fields that could not exist in non-pixellated form due to a condition imposed by [[wave optics]].&lt;ref name=HamiltonCourtial2009&gt;{{cite journal |author=A.

Much of the work on METATOYs is currently theoretical, backed up by computer simulations.  A small number of experiments have been performed to date; more experimental work is ongoing.

==Examples of METATOYs==
[[Image:Close-up of Dove-prism array seen from above.png|thumb|Close-up view of a METATOY formed by an array of upright [[Dove prism]]s, seen from above.  The view through the METATOY is shown in the previous image.]]

Telescopic optical components that have been used as the unit cell of two-dimensional arrays, and which therefore form homogeneous METATOYs, include a pair of identical lenses (focal length &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;) that share the same optical axis (perpendicular to the METATOY) and that are separated by &lt;math&gt;2 f&lt;/math&gt;, that is they share one focal plane (a special case of a [[refracting telescope]] with [[angular magnification]] -1);&lt;ref name=StevensHarvey2002&gt;{{cite journal |pages=S17–S21 |author=R.

Examples of inhomogeneous METATOYs include the moiré magnifier,&lt;ref name=HutleyEtAl1994&gt;{{cite journal|author=M. C. Hutley|title=The moiré magnifier| journal=Pure Appl. Opt.: J. Eur. Opt. Soc.

and [[frosted glass]], which can be seen as an extreme case of an inhomogeneous, random METATOY made from prisms.

Note that examples of METATOYs as defined above have existed long before analogies with metamaterials were noted and it was recognized that METATOYs can perform wave-optically forbidden ray-direction mappings (in pixellated form).&lt;ref name="HamiltonCourtial2009" /&gt;

==Wave-optical constraints on light-ray fields and METATOYs==
[[Wave optics]] describes light at a more fundamental level than [[geometrical optics]].  In the ray-optics limit (in which the optical [[wavelength]] tends towards zero) of scalar optics (in which light is described as a [[scalar wave]], an approximation that works well for [[paraxial]] light with uniform [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]), the light-ray field '''r'''&lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to a light wave &lt;math&gt;u(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; is its phase gradient,&lt;ref name=LandauLifschitz1992&gt;{{cite book|last=Landau|first=L. D.|author2=Lifschitz, E. M.|title=Klassische Feldtheorie|publisher=Akademie Verlag|year=1992|pages=154–157|isbn=978-3-05-501550-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}(x,y,z)=\nabla \phi(x,y,z),&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\phi(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; is the phase of the wave &lt;math&gt;u(x,y,z)=A(x,y,z) \exp(i \phi(x,y,z))&lt;/math&gt;.  But according to [[vector calculus identities|vector calculus]], the curl of any gradient is zero, that is
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \nabla \phi(x,y,z)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and therefore
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{r}(x,y,z)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This last equation is a condition, derived from wave optics, on light-ray fields.
(Each of the three equations that makes up this vector equation expresses the [[symmetry of second derivatives|symmetry of the second spatial derivatives]], which is how the condition was initially formulated.&lt;ref name="HamiltonCourtial2009" /&gt;)

Using the example of ray-rotation sheets,&lt;ref name=HamiltonEtAl2009&gt;{{cite journal|author=A. C. Hamilton|title=Local light-ray rotation|journal=J. Opt. Soc. Am. A|year=2009|postscript=.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was shown that METATOYs can create light-ray fields that do not satisfy the above condition on light-ray fields.&lt;ref name="HamiltonCourtial2009" /&gt;

==Relationship with metamaterials==
METATOYs are not [[metamaterial]]s in the standard sense.  The acronym "''meta''ma''t''erial f''o''r ra''y''s" was chosen because of a number of similarities between METATOYs and metamaterials,&lt;ref name="HamiltonCourtial2009" /&gt; which are discussed below, along with the differences.
In addition, metamaterials provided the inspiration for early METATOYs research, as summarized in the following quote:&lt;ref name="HamiltonCourtial2009" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Motivated by the desire to build optical elements that have some of the visual properties of metamaterials on an everyday size scale and across the entire visible wavelength spectrum, we recently started to investigate sheets formed by miniaturized optical elements that change the direction of transmitted light rays.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Similarities with metamaterials===
In a number of ways, METATOYs are analogous to [[metamaterial]]s:&lt;ref name="HamiltonCourtial2009" /&gt;
''structure'':  metamaterials are arrays of small (sub-wavelength size) wave-optical components (electro-magnetic circuits resonant with the optical frequency), whereas METATOYs are arrays of small (so that they work well as pixels), telescopic, "ray-optical components";
''functionality'':  both metamaterials and METATOYs can behave like homogeneous materials, in the case of metamaterials a volume of material, in the case of METATOYs a sheet material, in both cases with very unusual optical properties such as negative refraction.

===Differences with metamaterials===
Arguably amongst the most startling properties of metamaterials are some that are fundamentally wave-optical, and therefore not reproduced in METATOYs.  These include amplification of evanescent waves, which can, in principle, lead to perfect lenses ("superlenses") &lt;ref name=Pendry2000&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. B. Pendry|title=Negative Refraction Makes a Perfect Lens|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|volume=85|pages=3966–3969|year=2000|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.3966|pmid=11041972|issue=18|postscript=.|bibcode=2000PhRvL..85.3966P}}&lt;/ref&gt; and magnifying superlenses ("hyperlenses");&lt;ref name=JacobEtAl2006&gt;{{cite journal|author=Z. Jacob|title=Optical Hyperlens: Far-field imaging beyond the diffraction limit|journal=Opt. Express|volume=14|pages=8247–8256|year=2006|doi=10.1364/OE.14.008247|pmid=19529199|issue=18|postscript=.|arxiv = physics/0607277 |bibcode = 2006OExpr..14.8247J |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Z. Liu|title=Far-Field Optical Hyperlens Magnifying Sub-Diffraction-Limited Objects|journal=Science|volume=315|page=1686|year=2007|doi=10.1126/science.1137368|pmid=17379801|issue=5819|postscript=.|bibcode=2007Sci...315.1686L|display-authors=etal|citeseerx=10.1.1.708.3342}}&lt;/ref&gt; reversal of the [[phase velocity]]; reversal of the [[Doppler shift]].

On the other hand, because they are not bound by wave-optical constraints on light-ray fields, it can be argued that METATOYs can perform light-ray-direction changes that metamaterials could not, unless a METATOY was effectively built out of metamaterials.

'''Marble Bar''' is a town and rock formation in the [[Pilbara]] region of north-western [[Western Australia]]. It is well known for its extremely hot weather. By mean maximum temperatures it is the second hottest place in Australia, behind only [[Wyndham, Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hottest places by maximum mean temperature in Australia |url=http://www.bonzle.com/c/a?a=f&amp;sc=hot |website=Bonzle Digital Atlas of Australia |accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The town was officially gazetted in 1893 following the discovery of [[gold]] in the area in 1890 by a [[prospecting|prospector]] named Francis Jenkins who is remembered by the name of the town's main street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Western-Australia/Marble-Bar/2005/02/17/1108500208281.html|title=Marble Bar|accessdate=2008-09-16 | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Marble Bar was derived from a nearby [[jasper]] bar mistaken for [[marble]] and now known as Marble Bar, which runs across the bed of the [[Coongan River]].

In 1891 the town boasted a population in excess of 5,000 as it experienced a rush on the goldfields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.about-australia.com/western-australia/australias-north-west/destinations/marble-bar/|title=About Australia - Marble Bar, WA |year=2008|accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1895 the town had its Government offices built; these are now [[National Trust of Australia|National Trust]] buildings. Cut from local stone, the buildings still stand today.

Possibly the most famous building in the town is the ''Ironclad hotel'' built in the 1890s, constructed of corrugated Iron, and given the name by American miners who were reminded of the [[Ironclad warship|Ironclad ships]] from the United States. In 2006, the Ironclad hotel was listed on the Western Australian register of heritage places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2006/02/07/1564216.htm|title=ABC News - Historic Marble Bar hotel to get heritage listing|year=2006|accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several large [[gold nugget]]s were discovered as a result of the goldrush. The 333 [[ounce]] Little Hero nugget, the 413 ounce Bobby Dazzler and the 332 ounce General Gordon nugget were all found in the goldfields around the town.

During [[World War II]], [[United States Army Air Forces]] and [[Royal Australian Air Force]] [[heavy bomber]]s were based {{convert|25|km}} away [[as the crow flies]] at [[Corunna Downs Airfield]]. Allied airmen from the base attacked [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]ese forces as far away as [[Borneo]].

The Port Hedland to Marble Bar railway opened on 15 July 1911, costing around ₤300,000 to build.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article233483510|title=Port Hedland|date=18 July 1911|newspaper=[[The Murchison Times And Day Dawn Gazette]]|accessdate=26 November 2017|issue=141|location=Western Australia|volume=17|page=3|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article211366545|title=Port Hedland-Marble Bar railway|date=17 July 1911|newspaper=[[Geraldton Express]]|accessdate=26 November 2017|location=Western Australia|volume=XXXIII|page=3|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to low traffic and high financial losses, the railway closed from 31 May 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article76086479|title=Hedland- Marble Bar railway to close|date=24 May 1951|newspaper=[[Northern Times]]|accessdate=26 November 2017|issue=21|location=Western Australia|volume=75|page=6|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This railway could be seen as a narrow gauge precursor to the network of standard gauge [[iron-ore]] railways that have since been created across the [[Pilbara]].

==Climate ==
Marble Bar has a [[Desert climate#Hot desert climates|hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWh'') with sweltering summers and warm winters. Most of the annual rainfall occurs in the summer. The town set a world record of most consecutive days of {{convert|100|F|1}} or above, during a period of 160 days from 31 October 1923 to 7 April 1924.&lt;ref name="climateextremes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp1.htm|title=Marble Bar heatwave, 1923-1924|work=Australian Climate Extremes|publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology]]|accessdate=21 September 2008|archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp1.html|archivedate=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although annual temperatures indicate Marble Bar should be within the [[tropics]], with a July (winter) mean of {{convert|19|C|F}}, it does not have the high precipitation requirements for hot-weather climates to sustain tropical vegetation.

During December and January, temperatures in excess of {{Convert|45|C|F}} are common, and the average maximum temperature exceeds [[normal human body temperature]] for six months each year. Marble Bar receives 159.6 clear days annually. [[Dewpoint]] in the summers is between {{convert|10|and|15|C|F}}. In contrast to most of the year, winters are warm, with days averaging {{convert|27|C|F}}, low humidity and clear skies. Nights from June to August can be chilly, occasionally as low as {{convert|5|C|F}} but frost is unknown. Even in mid winter however, brief bursts of heat can result in the temperature rising to as high as {{convert|35|C|F}} for a few days before dropping back to normal.

Rainfall is sparse and erratic, though variability is significantly less extreme than over the coastal Pilbara – the tenth [[percentile]] being {{convert|190.9|mm|in|2}} vis-à-vis only {{convert|67.4|mm|in|2}} in [[Onslow, Western Australia|Onslow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dewar|first=Robert E|last2=Wallis|first2=James R|title=Geographical patterning of interannual rainfall variability in the tropics and near tropics: An L-moments approach|journal=[[Journal of Climate]]|volume=12|issue=12|pages=3457–3466|bibcode=1999JCli...12.3457D|year=1999|doi=10.1175/1520-0442(1999)012&lt;3457:GPOIRV&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It falls largely between December and March, with occasional rain events from autumn northwest cloudbands up to June. As little as {{convert|71.1|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} can fall in a year; however, during heavy wet seasons when the monsoon reaches well south into the Pilbara, the rainfall can be significantly more – as much as {{convert|927.1|mm|in|2}} fell between April 1999 and March 2000, and {{convert|797.9|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} fell in 1980 owing to several [[tropical cyclone]]s. The most rain recorded in a month is {{convert|417.4|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} in March 2007,&lt;ref name="climate2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_004106_All.shtml|title=Climate statistics for Australian locations: Marble Bar|publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology]]|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most in one day {{convert|304.8|mm|in|2}} on 2 March 1941.&lt;ref name="climate"/&gt;

A locality nearby is known as ''North Pole'' (21° 05' S. 119° 22' E.). It is the location of rock formations considered to have evidence that puts the origin of life on earth back to 3,400–3,500 million years ago, due to [[stromatolites]] in particular rock sequences.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Kim.

==Background==
The early development of this type of complex takes place around the turn of the 19th century. In 1886 Janovski observed an intense violet color when he mixed [[1,3-Dinitrobenzene|''meta''-dinitrobenzene]] with an alcoholic solution of alkali. In 1895 [[Cornelis Adriaan Lobry van Troostenburg de Bruyn|Lobry de Bruyn]] investigated a red substance formed in the reaction of [[trinitrobenzene]] with [[potassium hydroxide]] in [[methanol]]. In 1900 Jackson and Gazzolo reacted [[trinitroanisole]] with [[sodium methoxide]] and proposed a [[quinoid]] structure for the reaction product.

:[[Image:MeisenheimerComplex.png|500px|Scheme 1. The Meisenheimer complex]]

In 1902 [[Jakob Meisenheimer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | title = Ueber Reactionen aromatischer Nitrokörper
 | author = [[Jakob Meisenheimer]]
 | journal = [[Annalen der Chemie|Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie]]
 | volume = 323
 | issue = 2
 | year = 1902
 | pages = 205–246
 | doi = 10.1002/jlac.19023230205}}&lt;/ref&gt; observed that by acidifying their reaction product, the starting material was recovered.

With three electron withdrawing groups, the negative charge in the complex is located at one of the nitro groups according to the quinoid model. When less electron poor arenes this charge is delocalized over the entire ring (structure to the right in ''scheme 1'').

In one study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Evidence for Carbon–Carbon Meisenheimer–Wheland Complexes between Superelectrophilic and Supernucleophilic Carbon Reagents  |author1=Carla Boga |author2=Erminia Del Vecchio |author3=Luciano Forlani |author4=Andrea Mazzanti |author5=Paolo E.

The [[Wheland intermediate]] is its opposite number{{clarify|date=September 2015}} and the [[reactive intermediate]] in [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]].

:[[Image:MeisenHeimerWhelandComplex.png|380px|Scheme 2 Meisenheimer–Wheland complex]]

The structure of this complex was confirmed by [[NMR spectroscopy]].

==Janovski reaction==

The '''Janovski reaction''' is the reaction of 1,3-[[dinitrobenzene]] with an [[enol]]izable [[ketone]] to the Meisenheimer adduct.

==Zimmermann reaction==
In the '''Zimmermann reaction''' the Janovski adduct is oxidized with excess base to a strongly colored enolate with subsequent reduction of the dinitro compound to the aromatic nitro amine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wubbels|first=Gene G.|last2=Winitz|first2=Simeon|last3=Whitaker|first3=Craig|date=1990-01-01|title=NMR and ultraviolet spectral characterization of dihydrobenzene intermediates in the displacement of hydrogen by intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic photosubstitution|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jo00289a043|journal=The Journal of Organic Chemistry|volume=55|issue=2|pages=631–636|doi=10.1021/jo00289a043|issn=0022-3263}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction is the basis of the '''Zimmermann test''' used for the detection of [[17-Ketosteroid|ketosteroids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haskins|first1=Arthur L.|last2=Sherman|first2=Alfred I.|last3=Allen|first3=Willard M.|title=Paper Chromatographic Separation and Ultraviolet Analysis of Commercially Prepared Progesterone|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=1950|volume=182|issue=1|pages=429–438|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/182/1/429.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montreal East Refinery ([[Gulf Canada]]) is a small petrochemical refinery located inside the city of Montréal-Est and inside the Coastal Petrochemical fields.  The operator of the refining unit is Coastal Petrochemical (Petrochimie Coastal du Canada).

==History==
The refinery was constructed by [[British-American Oil]] Company in the 1930s to process crude oil imported from [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishamericanoil.ca/history4.html History of the British-American Oil Company, page 4].  Retrieved 2015-04-08&lt;/ref&gt;  It was shut down by B/A’s successor company, Gulf Canada, in 1983.  Ultramar Canada purchased the 74,000 b/d capacity facility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19850814&amp;id=J4oxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uqUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2373,992906&amp;hl=en Untramar seeks Gulf's assets, The Montreal Gazette, August 14, 1985].  Retrieved 2015-04-08&lt;/ref&gt; refinery from Gulf Canada in 1986 and closed it soon after with the loss of 450 jobs. &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19851227&amp;id=P68yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=le8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1947,2051787&amp;hl=en Montreal refinery closure approved, The Ottawa Citizen, December 27, 1985].  Retrieved 2017-11-09&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 1986 Montreal-based engineering firm [[SNC Lavalin|Lavalin Inc.]] announced it was purchasing the refinery and would re-open it.&lt;Ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19860627&amp;id=1kkwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=R6gFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1497,3193669&amp;hl=en The Montreal Gazette, June 27, 1986].  Retrieved 2015-04-08&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1986 the refinery and its 210 000 m2 site was sold to Kemtec Petrochemicals which converted the plant to produce [[p-Xylene|paraxylene]].  The plant came on line in 1989 and operated until 1991.  That year Kemtec filed for bankruptcy.  The site was determined to be heavily contaminated and, facing potentially large clean-up costs, all creditors of the company except the Government of Quebec declined to take over the property.  

==Recent operations==
In 1994 the refinery was purchased by Coastal Canada Petroleum, Inc., (CCP) a subsidiary of Houston-based [[Coastal Corporation]], for USD $1.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/COASTAL+SUBSIDIARY+ACQUIRES+KEMTEC+PETROCHEMICAL+PLANT%3B+MONTREAL...-a015658628 Coastal Subsidiary Acquires Kemtec Petrochemical Plant, PRNewsire, August 4, 1994].  Retrieved 2015-04-08&lt;/ref&gt;  CCP acquired the processing equipment, entered into a long-term lease for the site, and agreed to make payments to an environmental trust fund for remediation of the contaminated site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13050">&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Nerc logo.JPG|thumb|right|200px]] --&gt;A '''NERC Tag''', also commonly referred to as an '''E-Tag''', represents a transaction on the [[North America]]n bulk electricity market scheduled to flow within, between or across electric utility company territories.  The NERC Tag is named for the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation|North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)]], which is the entity that was responsible for the implementation of the first energy tagging processes.  NERC Tags were first introduced in 1997, in response to the need to track the increasingly complicated [[Electricity market|energy transactions]] which were produced as a result of the beginning of electric [[deregulation]] in North America.

==Electric Deregulation in North America==

The [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)]]'s [[Energy Policy Act of 1992]] was the first major step towards electric deregulation in North America, and was followed by a much more definitive action when FERC issued Orders 888 and 889 in 1996, which laid the groundwork for formalized deregulation of the industry and led to the creation of the network of [[Open Access Same-Time Information System|Open Access Same-Time Information System (OASIS)]] nodes.

FERC is an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]] and thus its authority extends only over [[Electric utility|electric utilities]] operating in the United States.  However, NERC members include all of the FERC footprint as well as all of the electric utilities in lower [[Canada]] and a [[Mexico|Mexican]] utility company.  In the interest of reciprocity and commonality, all NERC members generally cooperate with FERC rules.

The creation of OASIS nodes allowed for energy to be scheduled across multiple power systems, creating complex strings of single "point-to-point" transactions which could be connected end-to-end to literally travel across the continent.  This frequently created situations where it was difficult or impossible for [[transmission system operator]]s to ascertain all of the transactions impacting their local system or take any corrective actions to alleviate situations which could put the [[Electric power transmission|power grid]] at risk of damage or collapse.  The NERC Tag was implemented as a result of this new problem introduced by deregulation.

==NERC Tag Versions==

===NERC Tag 1.x===

The earliest NERC Tag application was based on a [[Microsoft Excel]] [[spreadsheet]], and was introduced in 1997.  The form was usually completed by the power marketers or schedulers, by defining the date and time of the transaction, the physical path of the energy schedule from its point of [[Electricity generation|generation]] to point of consumption, the financial path (buying/selling chain) of the energy schedule, the hourly energy amounts scheduled to flow, and also the OASIS transmission requests for each power system crossed which thereby documented that permission to cross each power system had been properly obtained.

Elements of a NERC Tag included Control Areas (CA), Transmission Providers (TP), Purchasing/Selling Entities (PSE), transmission Points of Receipt (POR) and Points of Delivery (POD), as well as product codes for several transmission and generation priorities.

The physical path was the most important aspect of the NERC Tag in terms of understanding the impact of a collection of individual transactions after they had been compiled into a single complete transaction.  To complete the physical path it was necessary to identify the power system and power plant where the energy was to be generated, any and all power systems that would be utilized to move the energy to its eventual destination, and lastly the power system and location of the delivery point where the energy would be consumed (the "load").

When a NERC Tag was created in the spreadsheet, the information was then distilled into a small [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] formatted data packet which was disseminated via [[e-mail]] to all of the participants listed on the NERC tag.  In this way, all participants of a transaction were able to determine which other electric utilities and power marketers were involved in the transaction, and what the roles of the other participants were.  More importantly, in the event of a contingency such as a [[Power outage|transmission line outage]] or generation failure, all participants could more easily be notified of the schedule change, and could then all act in cooperation to curtail the scheduled transaction.

The NERC Tag 1.0 implementation was not capable of collecting schedule flow data in any useful way, but it did serve to familiarize schedulers with the demands of tagging their transactions, a process that would eventually be mandatory.  A database of transmission scheduling points maintained by NERC through the [[Transmission System Information Networks|Transmission System Information Networks (TSIN)]] that was originally developed for the OASIS nodes was greatly expanded to include additional information required in the process of creating NERC Tags.

The spreadsheet-based NERC Tag application saw minor improvements in functionality and scope with small incremental changes which advanced it to NERC Tag 1.3, although there was not much discernible difference to the participants, and until version 1.4 was implemented, any previous version could still be used.

===E-Tag 1.4 and 1.5===

Not long after NERC introduced the NERC Tag spreadsheet and packet emailer, NERC concluded that it did not want involvement in any future software development or maintenance.  A NERC Tag specification document, version 1.4, was drafted as the next level in energy tagging, the NERC Tag would subsequently also be known as an '''E-Tag'''.  Data transfer would now occur directly over an [[Internet]] connection instead of via e-mail.  This eliminated the cumbersome process required to receive a data packet via email and port it back into the original spreadsheet-based tagging application.  This change made the NERC Tag much easier to use in a real-time application.  E-Tag 1.4 went into effect in 1999, but was replaced just nine months later with E-Tag 1.5, followed three months later with E-Tag 1.501.  The 1.5 and 1.501 Specs corrected the shortcomings experienced with the initial release of the first E-Tag Spec.

Although NERC was responsible for the E-Tag Spec, it opened development of the application to run it to the software market.  Initially there were numerous E-Tagging software providers, mainly a mix of small [[Startup company|start-ups]] and new applications developed by existing energy industry software developers.  The E-Tag 1.5 Spec was written in such a way that the various applications were permitted to have differing [[graphical user interface|graphical user interfaces (GUIs)]], but functionally "under the hood" they were required to be able to interact with each other when transmitting, receiving and processing E-Tags.  A new feature introduced with E-Tag 1.4/1.5, made possible by the real-time sharing of E-Tags, was the ability for reliability entities (namely the CA's and TP's) in the E-Tag to electronically approve or deny E-Tags based on various criteria.

The arrival of real-time tagging also enabled NERC to begin collecting real-time and short-term future data regarding the energy transactions scheduled throughout the North American power grid.  The data from approved transactions was ported to the [[Interchange Distribution Calculator|Interchange Distribution Calculator (IDC)]], where the data could be applied to a virtual study model of the [[Eastern Interconnection]].  The IDC went online in 1999.

===E-Tag 1.6===

Building on the lessons experienced with E-Tag applications to date, E-Tag 1.6 went into effect in 2000.  There were seven variations of E-Tag 1.6, up to E-Tag 1.67 which was in effect until late 2002.  Most of the changes in E-Tag 1.6 were of a functional nature and not overly apparent to the users.

Under E-Tag 1.6, NERC implemented the "no tag, no flow" rule, where all energy transactions were to be documented with an E-Tag.  Accurate system studies of the Eastern Interconnection in order to determine which schedules should be curtailed would only be possible if every transaction was tagged and therefore included in the IDC calculations.  Reliability Coordinators in the Eastern Interconnection could access the IDC online and run flow studies based on various operating scenarios with all of the current energy schedules derived from the E-Tags.  When an actual contingency occurred, the Reliability Coordinators could identify the constrained transmission line or corridor within the IDC, and the IDC would then identify which E-Tagged schedules should be curtailed in order to ease the loading on the restricted facilities.

===E-Tag 1.7===

NERC's E-Tag 1.7 Specification completely reworked the E-Tag platform from scratch.  Some users said that it was so significant that it might have been more appropriate to have called it "E-Tag 2.0".  For the first time, [[xml|Extensible Markup Language (XML)]] was utilized to format the data transferred between E-Tag applications, finally replacing the base CSV data transfer format based on its ancestral NERC Tag 1.0 spreadsheet/e-mail origins.  The TSIN database was expanded to include generation and load points which were matched with PSEs that had rights to schedule them, and also included complex associations that enforced matched sets of PORs and PODs with TPs.  E-Tag 1.7 also greatly expanded the time frame flexibility of an E-Tag by allowing extensions and modifications with comprehensive approval processes, layering of multiple OASIS requests for transmission rights, and also fully automated the tag curtailment functions from the IDC so that individual manual tag curtailments were no longer necessary.

Shortly after E-Tag 1.7 went online in 2002, the [[Western Electricity Coordinating Council|Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC)]] implemented the [[WECC Unscheduled Flow Tool|WECC Unscheduled Flow (USF) Tool]], which accomplished a similar automated curtailing capability for the [[Western Interconnection]] that the IDC had done for the Eastern Interconnection.

The number of software choices for E-Tag software dwindled within the first few years to a handful of major players.  The number of E-Tag users was strictly limited by the number of entities involved in E-Tagging, and the cost of complying with NERC E-Tag Specifications became prohibitive for any software company that did not already have significant market share or adequate financial backing.  The added complexities of E-Tag 1.7 dealt a severe blow to most of the E-Tagging software providers, and within a year of E-Tag 1.7 going online, there was only one dominant E-Tag software provider remaining, which also provided all IDC and WECC USF services, though a few holdouts and customer-developed "in-house" E-Tag applications remain.

Version 1.7.097 of E-Tag was implemented on January 3, 2007.

===E-Tag 1.8===

Five years following the release of E-Tag 1.7, a major update was developed and implemented on December 4, 2007.  E-Tag 1.8 cleaned up some long-standing issues not easily addressed with minor revisions to E-Tag 1.7 and brought the E-Tag applications back up to current industry policy standards.

==Future of E-Tag==

OASIS primarily deals with the purchase and availability of transmission from individual transmission providers with a forward-looking time frame, while E-Tag is focused on real-time scheduling and power flow management across multiple systems.  Nonetheless, the FERC-derived OASIS applications and NERC-derived E-Tag applications are somewhat duplicative.  FERC's plan for the eventual introduction of '''OASIS Phase 2''' envisions a combined platform to post transmission offerings, allow transmission purchases, and facilitate scheduling and flow management, effectively merging the essential functions of E-Tag and OASIS.  However, there has been very little activity to move towards OASIS Phase 2 since the introduction of E-Tag 1.7 in 2002, and the future remains unclear.  As both systems have increased in complexity over time, the difficulties in merging the two independently evolved systems have likewise also increased.

'''Narec''', since 2014 known as the '''National Renewable Energy Centre''', is a part of the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) [[Catapult centres|Catapult]], a British technology innovation and research centre for [[offshore wind power]], [[Wave power|wave energy]], [[tidal power|tidal energy]] and [[low carbon]] technologies. ORE Catapult's head office is in Glasgow, Scotland. The centre operates multi-purpose offshore renewable energy test and demonstration facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Test &amp; Demonstration assets – Catapult|url = https://ore.catapult.org.uk/testing|website = ore.catapult.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to other centres, such as [[NREL]] in the US&lt;ref&gt;http://www.narec.co.uk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216002837/http://www.narec.co.uk/ |date=16 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Centre for Renewable Energies (CENER)]] in Spain. The National Renewable Energy Centre is based in [[Blyth, Northumberland]].

==History==

Originally known as NaREC (New and Renewable Energy Centre), the centre was created in 2002 by [[One NorthEast]], the North East [[regional development agency]], as part of the ''Strategy for Success'' programme.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strategyforsuccess.info/page/news/article.cfm?articleId=1400&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the organisation changed its name to Narec (National Renewable Energy Centre).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companiesintheuk.co.uk/ltd/national-renewable-energy-centre|title=OFFSHORE RENEWABLE ENERGY CATAPULT|work=CompaniesInTheUK}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, the organisation merged with the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult to focus on the development and cost reduction of offshore wind, wave and tidal energy across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ORE Catapult and Narec merge|url = http://renews.biz/64303/ore-catapult-narec-link-ships|website = reNEWS – Renewable Energy News|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Narec to merge with Glasgow’s Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult|url = http://www.thejournal.co.uk/business/business-news/narec-merge-glasgows-offshore-renewable-6917321|website = journallive|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation was originally involved in a wide range of technologies, including:
* Wind (onshore and offshore)
* Transmission and distribution
* Photovoltaics
* Oil and gas
* Marine renewables
* Fuel cells
* Microrenewables
* Biomass&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narec.co.uk/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216002837/http://www.narec.co.uk/|title=Welcome to NaREC|archivedate=16 February 2008|work=narec.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, due to UK government cutbacks, Narec closed, sold off or separated parts of the business. Now, Narec itself concentrates on testing blades and drive trains for marine renewables. Spin-off companies include:

'''Narec Distributed Energy''' – An organisation which deals with microrenewables, energy efficiency, low carbon transport and citywide energy planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narecde.co.uk|title=Narec Distributed Energy – National Renewable Energy Centre Group|work=Narec Distributed Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narec Distributed Energy is 100% owned by Narec.

'''Solar''' '''Capture Technologies''' – 8% owned by Narec, and 92% owned by the Swedish firm Absolicon. This organisation is focused on silicon photovoltaic cells.&lt;ref name="wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/57f66c2d0af5abf81b3aeaaf94e518dc/compdetails|title=Failure Page|work=companieshouse.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narecsolar.com|title=Solar Capture Technologies – Home – Solar Capture Technologies|work=Solar Capture Technologies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absolicon.com/narec-solar-spun-out/|title=Narec Solar Spun Out|work=absolicon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narec Capital''' – A financial organisation run by Narec and Ashberg Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nebusiness.co.uk/business-news/latest-business-news/2011/07/04/narec-capital-looking-to-raise-300m-of-funding-51140-28987729/|title=Narec Capital looking to raise £300m of funding|author=journallive Administrator|date=4 July 2011|work=journallive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narec Capital Risk Solutions''' – Beyond its existence, there is very little information on what this organisation does.&lt;ref name="wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk"/&gt;

Following its merger with ORE Catapult, the National Renewable Energy Centre now focuses on helping to de-risk and accelerate the development and commercialisation of the offshore renewable energy industry in the UK.

==Closed facilities==

===Clothier High Voltage Laboratory===

The [[Henry William Clothier|Clothier]] Electrical Testing Laboratory was opened in 1970 by [[A. Reyrolle &amp; Company]]. Narec took over the facility in 2004, to use it to test the robustness of electrical infrastructure offshore locations to onshore sites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nebusiness.co.uk/business-news/latest-business-news/2010/05/13/narec-in-advanced-talks-on-wind-turbine-tests-51140-26434889/2/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although one of the few high voltage testing facilities in the world,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} the facility was closed by Narec in 2011 due to a lack of government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shieldsgazette.com/news/business/latest-news/plug_could_be_pulled_on_testing_lab_1_3230372|title=Plug could be pulled on testing lab|work=shieldsgazette.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many parts of the lab were relocated to Narec's main campus in Blyth. The ruins of the original lab are now the property of [[Siemens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/02/urban-explorers-highlight-decay-highest-voltage-lab-world|title=Urban explorers highlight the decay of the highest voltage lab in the world|work=newstatesman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NB-36H with B-50, 1955 - DF-SC-83-09332.jpeg|thumb|right| The only US aircraft to carry a nuclear reactor was the [[Convair NB-36H|NB-36H]]. The reactor was never actually connected to the engines. The program was cancelled in 1958.]]

A '''nuclear-powered aircraft''' is a concept for an [[aircraft]] intended to be powered by nuclear energy. The intention was to produce a [[jet engine]] that would heat compressed air with heat from fission, instead of heat from burning fuel. During the [[Cold War]], the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] researched nuclear-powered bomber aircraft, the greater endurance of which could enhance [[nuclear deterrence]], but neither country created any such operational aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/03/best-bad-idea-ever-why-putins-nuclear-powered-missile-is-possible-and-awful/&lt;/ref&gt;

One inadequately solved design problem was the need for heavy shielding to protect the crew and those on the ground from [[acute radiation syndrome]]; other potential problems included dealing with crashes.

Some unmanned missile designs included nuclear powered supersonic cruise missiles.

However, the advent of [[ICBM]]s, and [[nuclear submarine]]s in the 1960s greatly diminished the strategic advantage of such aircraft, and respective projects were cancelled; the inherent danger of the technology has prevented its civilian use.

==U.S. programs==

===NEPA and ANP===
{{Main|Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion}}

In May 1946, the [[United States Army Air Forces]] started the Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) project, which conducted studies until the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) program replaced NEPA in 1951. The ANP program included provisions for studying two different types of nuclear-powered jet engines: [[General Electric]]'s Direct Air Cycle and [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]]'s Indirect Air Cycle. ANP planned for Convair to modify two B-36s under the '''MX-1589''' project.  One of the B-36s, the [[Convair NB-36H|NB-36H]], was to be used for studying shielding requirements for an airborne reactor, while the other was to be the [[Convair X-6|X-6]]; however, the program was cancelled before the X-6 was completed.

The first operation of a nuclear aircraft engine occurred on January 31, 1956 using a modified [[General Electric J47]] [[turbojet]] engine.&lt;ref name=NTRS&gt;{{cite web|last=Thornton|first=G.|title=Introduction to nuclear propulsion- introduc- tion and background lecture 1, feb. 26-28, 1963|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19640019868|work=Nuclear Materials Propulsion Operation|publisher=NASA Technical Report Server|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion]] program was terminated by Kennedy after the President's annual budget message to Congress in 1961.

The [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] researched and developed nuclear aircraft engines. Two shielded reactors powered two [[General Electric J87]] [[turbojet]] engines to nearly full thrust. Two experimental engines complete with reactor system, HTRE 3 and HTRE 1, are at the [[EBR-1]] facility south of the [[Idaho National Laboratory]] {{Coord|43|30|42.22|N|113|0|18|W|display=inline}}.
[[File:Aircraft Reactors Arco ID 2009.jpg|thumb|right| Experimental HTRE reactors for nuclear aircraft, (HTRE 3 left and HTRE 1 right) on display at Idaho National Laboratory near Arco, Idaho ({{Coord|43|30|42.22|N|113|0|18|W|display=inline}}).]]

The U.S. designed these engines for use in a new, specially-designed nuclear bomber, the [[WS-125]].  Although Eisenhower eventually terminated it by cutting NEPA and telling Congress that the program was not urgent, he backed a small program for developing high temperature materials and high performance reactors; that program was terminated early in the Kennedy administration.

===Project Pluto===
{{Main|Project Pluto}}
In 1957, the Air Force and the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] contracted with the [[Lawrence Radiation Laboratory]] to study the feasibility of applying heat from nuclear reactors to [[ramjet]] engines. This research became known as ''Project Pluto''. This program was to provide engines for an unmanned cruise missile, called SLAM, for [[Supersonic Low Altitude Missile]]. The program succeeded in producing two test engines, which were operated on the ground. On May 14, 1961, the world's first nuclear ramjet engine, "Tory-IIA," mounted on a railroad car, roared to life for just a few seconds. On July 1, 1964, seven years and six months after it was born, "Project Pluto" was cancelled.

==Soviet programs==

===Soviet nuclear bomber hoax===
The 1 December 1958 issue of ''[[Aviation Week and Space Technology|Aviation Week]]'' included an article, ''Soviets Flight Testing Nuclear Bomber'', that claimed that the Soviets had greatly progressed a nuclear aircraft program:&lt;ref&gt;''Soviets Flight Testing Nuclear Bomber'', Aviation Week, 1 December 1958, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; "[a] nuclear-powered bomber is being flight tested in the Soviet Union. Completed about six months ago, this aircraft has been flying in the Moscow area for at least two months. It has been observed both in flight and on the ground by a wide variety of foreign observers from Communist and non-Communist countries." Unlike the US designs of the same era, which were purely experimental, the article noted that "The Soviet aircraft is a prototype of a design to perform a military mission as a continuous airborne alert warning system and missile launching platform."  Photographs illustrated the article, along with technical diagrams on the proposed layout; these were so widely seen that one company produced a plastic [[model aircraft]] based on the diagrams in the article.  An editorial on the topic accompanied the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modelarchives.free.fr/archives_P/Aplane/Aplane_Bounder_K.html|title=Modelarchives|author=|date=|website=modelarchives.free.fr|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns were soon expressed in Washington that "the Russians were from three to five years ahead of the US in the field of atomic aircraft engines and that they would move even further ahead unless the US pressed forward with its own program".&lt;ref&gt;''Soviet Nuclear Plane Possibility Conceded'', Ford Eastman, Aviation Week, 19 January 1959, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns caused continued but temporary funding of the US's own program.

The aircraft in the photographs was later revealed to be the conventional [[Myasishchev M-50]] ''Bounder'', a medium-range strategic bomber that performed like the USAFs [[B-58 Hustler]]. The design was considered a failure, never entered service, and was revealed to the public on Soviet Aviation Day in 1963 at [[Monino]], putting the issue to rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modelarchives.free.fr/archives_P/Aplane/Aplane_Bounder_S.html|title=Modelarchives|author=|date=|website=modelarchives.free.fr|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tupolev Tu-119===
{{main|Tupolev Tu-95LAL}}
The Soviet program of nuclear aircraft development resulted in the experimental [[Tupolev Tu-119]], or the Tu-95LAL (LAL- Летающая Атомная Лаборатория- Flying Nuclear Laboratory) which derived from the [[Tupolev Tu-95]] bomber. It had 4 conventional turboprop engines and an onboard nuclear reactor. The Tu-119 completed 34 research flights, most of which were made with the reactor shut down. The main purpose of the flight phase was examining the effectiveness of the radiation shielding, which was one of the main concerns for the engineers. Massive shielding was needed in order to reduce radiation levels, and the obvious potential of the [[ICBM]] made the expensive program superfluous, and around the mid-1960s it was cancelled.

Several other projects reached only the design phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buttler|Gordon|2004|pp=78–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colon|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russian programs ==

In February 2018, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] claimed that Russia had developed a new, nuclear-powered cruise missile with nuclear warhead that can evade air and missile defenses and hit any point on the globe. According to the statements its first flight test occurred in 2017. It was claimed to feature "a small-size super-powerful power plant that can be placed inside the hull of a cruise missile and guarantee a range of flight ten times greater than that of other missiles." The video showed the missile evading defense systems over the Atlantic, flying over [[Cape Horn]] and finally north towards Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenseworld.net/news/22065/Putin_Reveals_New_Russian_Nuclear_Missile_Defense|title=Putin Reveals New Russian Nuclear Missile Defense|author=|date=|website=www.defenseworld.net|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tass.com/defense/992226|title=Putin declares creation of unstoppable nuclear-powered missile|author=|date=|website=tass.com|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/420157-russia-new-hypersonic-icbm/|title=Russia's new hypersonic Sarmat ICBM has begun active testing – Putin (VIDEO)|author=|date=|website=rt.com|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/putin-claims-russia-has-nuclear-arsenal-capable-of-avoiding-missile-defenses/2018/03/01/d2dcf522-1d3b-11e8-b2d9-08e748f892c0_story.html|title=Putin claims Russia is developing nuclear arms capable of avoiding missile defenses|first=Anton|last=Troianovski|date=1 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/03/01/russias-putin-boasts-all-powerful-nuclear-missile/384142002/|title=Putin says 'no one in the world has anything like' all-powerful nuclear missile|author=|date=|website=usatoday.com|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date there is no publicly available evidence to verify these statements.

But that's incredible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/03/01/590014611/experts-aghast-over-russian-claim-of-nuclear-powered-missile-with-unlimited-rang|title=Experts Aghast At Russian Claim Of Nuclear-Powered Missile With Unlimited Range|author=|date=|website=npr.org|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a CSIS fellow, such a nuclear powered missile "has an almost unlimited range -- you could have it flying around for long periods of time before you order it to hit something"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/arms-expert-putin-weapons-look-like-overkill-question-and-answer/29071494.html|title=Q&amp;A: Arms Expert Says Putin's Weapons Boasts Look Like 'Overkill'|author=|date=|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putin's statements and the video showing a concept of the missile in flight suggest that it is not a supersonic ramjet like [[Project Pluto]] but a subsonic vehicle with a nuclear-heated turbojet or turbofan engine.

The new cruise missile will be named Burevestnik (Thunderbird).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.janes.com/article/78819/new-russian-weapons-named&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fusion power==
Lockheed-Martin announced, in 2014, that they were working on developing a small [[High beta fusion reactor|fusion reactor]]. They described it as being about the size of a jet engine and having the potential to power aircraft, spaceships, and cities. They expected it to be operating before 2024.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sploid.gizmodo.com/lockheed-martins-new-fusion-reactor-might-change-humani-1646578094 Lockheed Martin's new fusion reactor might change humanity forever], Jesus Diaz, 10/15/2014 10:41am, retrieved 15 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nuyts Archipelago Wilderness Protection Area''' is a [[protected area]] located  in the [[Nuyts Archipelago]] off the west coast of [[Eyre Peninsula]] in [[South Australia]] within {{convert|10|km|abbr=off}} to {{convert|75|km|abbr=off}} south-west of [[Ceduna, South Australia|Ceduna]].  The wilderness protection area was proclaimed in August 2011 under the ''Wilderness Protection Act 1992'' in order to protect ‘important island habitat for species such as the [[stick-nest rat]] and [[brush-tailed bettong]]s (which are part of re-introduction programs) and species such as the [[carpet python]] and [[short-nosed bandicoot]]’ and habitat for ‘other notable species’ including the [[Australian sea lion]] and [[Short-tailed shearwater|mutton bird]]s.  It was created on land both excised from the [[Nuyts Archipelago Conservation Park]] and land on Evans Island previously classed as unalienated Crown land with exception of a portion held by [[Australian Maritime Safety Authority]] for ‘lighthouse purposes’.  The land excised from the Nuyts Archipelago Conservation Park comprised the following islands: Purdie Islands, Lound Island, Goat Island, Lacy Islands, Lilliput Island, Franklin Islands, Blefuscu Island, Egg Island, Freeling Island, [[Smooth Island (South Australia)|Smooth Island]], Dog Island, West Island, [[St Francis Island]], Masillon Island, Fenelon Island and Hart Island.  The Wilderness Protection Area is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category Ib — Wilderness Area|Category Ib protected area]].&lt;ref name=2012-13report&gt;{{cite journal|title=Wilderness Advisory Committee Annual Report 2012-13|date=September 2013|pages=18|url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/5ad5624b-73b3-4284-86e0-a28900c9111c/wilderness-annual-report-2012-13-rep.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2014|issn=1832-9357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CAPAD2012SASum&gt;{{cite web|title=CAPAD 2012 South Australia Summary (see 'DETAIL' tab)|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/0f927a4e-336a-490c-a896-ec37874a5c73/files/capad2012sa.xlsx|work=CAPAD 2012|publisher=Australian Government - Department of the Environment|accessdate=6 February 2014|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PHASR Rifle.jpg|thumb|200px|PHASR Rifle]]
The '''personnel halting and stimulation response rifle''' ('''PHASR''') is a prototype [[Non-lethal force|non-lethal]] [[laser]] [[dazzler (weapon)|dazzler]] developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory's Directed Energy Directorate, U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].&lt;ref&gt;Eva D. Blaylock (Air Force Research Laboratory Directed Energy Directorate Public Affairs). [https://archive.is/20120721195102/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123012699 New technology 'dazzles' aggressors], The Official Website of the U.S. Air Force, Posted November 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to temporarily disorient and blind a target. Blinding laser weapons have been tested in the past, but were banned under the 1995 UN [[Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons]], which the United States [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties|acceded]] to on 21 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unog.ch/__80256ee600585943.nsf/(httpPages)/3ce7cfc0aa4a7548c12571c00039cb0c?OpenDocument&amp;ExpandSection=1%2C3%2C2#_Section1|title=United Nations Office at Geneva|publisher=www.unog.ch|accessdate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PHASR rifle, a low-intensity laser, is not prohibited under this regulation, as the blinding effect is intended to be temporary.  It also uses a two-wavelength laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Personnel Halting and Stimulation Response (PHaSR) |url=http://www.kirtland.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070404-043.pdf |website=Official United States Air Force Website |publisher=Air Force Research Laboratory, Office of Public Affairs |accessdate=21 October 2018 |ref=USAFFactSheet |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920034509/https://www.kirtland.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070404-043.pdf |archivedate=20 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PHASR was tested at [[Kirtland Air Force Base]], part of the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] [[Air Force Research Laboratory#Directorates|Directed Energy Directorate]] in [[New Mexico]].

Its name is likely derived from The [[List of weapons in Star Trek#Phaser|Phaser]] in [[Star Trek]]

A '''raw material''', also known as a '''feedstock''', '''unprocessed material''', or '''primary commodity''', is a basic material that is used to produce goods, finished products, energy, or intermediate materials which are feedstock for future finished products. As feedstock, the term connotes these materials are bottleneck assets and are highly important with regard to producing other products. An example of this is [[crude oil]], which is a raw material and a feedstock used in the production of industrial [[chemical]]s, [[fuel]]s, [[plastic]]s, and [[pharmaceutical]] goods; [[lumber]] is a raw material used to produce a variety of products including all types of furniture.&lt;ref name="w10"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jakob|last=Wolf|title=Schnellkurs HGB-Jahresabschluss: Das neue Bilanzrecht: Richtig vorgehen&amp;nbsp;— erfolgreich umstellen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyWUFP7FnY4C&amp;pg=PA90|date=15 January 2010|publisher=Walhalla Fachverlag|isbn=978-3-8029-3436-0|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metallic raw material production follows the processes such as crushing, roasting, magnetic separation, flotation, and leaching (at the first step), smelting and alloying (at the second step). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/materials-processing|title=Materials processing|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "raw material" denotes materials in minimally processed or unprocessed in states; e.g., raw [[latex]], [[crude oil]], [[cotton]], [[coal]], raw [[biomass]], [[iron ore]], [[air]], [[lumber|logs]], or [[water]] i.e. "''...any product of agriculture, forestry, fishing and any other mineral that is in its natural form or which has undergone the transformation required to prepare it for internationally marketing in substantial volumes.''"&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Degryse, L'économie en 100 et quelques mots d'actualité, De Boeck, 2005, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Places with plentiful raw materials and little economic development often show a phenomenon, known as "[[Dutch disease]]" or the "[[resource curse]]", that occurs when the economy of a country is mainly based upon its exports due to its method of governance.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Tchibambelela, Le commerce mondial de la faim: stratégie de rupture positive au Congo-Brazzaville, Éditions L'Harmattan, 2009, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] as it is rich in raw materials; the [[Second Congo War]] focused on controlling these raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal Boniface, La géopolitique: Les relations internationales, Éditions Eyrolles et tout le monde s'en fou, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raw materials are also used by non-humans, such as birds using [[found object]]s and [[twig]]s to create [[nest]]s.

==Early life==
Bose was born in [[Calcutta]] (now Kolkata), the eldest of seven children in a [[Bengali Kayastha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Satyendra Nath Bose|page=12|
author1 = Santimay Chatterjee|author2=Enakshi Chatterjee|year=1976|publisher=National Book Trust, India| quote=Satyendra Nath was born in Calcutta on the first of January, 1894, in a high caste Kayastha family with two generations of English education behind him.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  family. He was the only son, with six sisters after him. His ancestral home was in the village Bara Jagulia, in the district of [[Nadia district|Nadia]], in the state of [[West Bengal]]. His schooling began at the age of five, near his home.  When his family moved to Goabagan, he was admitted into the New Indian School.  In the final year of school, he was admitted into the [[Hindu School]].  He passed his entrance examination ([[matriculation]]) in 1909 and stood fifth in the order of merit. He next joined the intermediate science course at the [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency College]], Calcutta, where his teachers included [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]], [[Sarada Prasanna Das]], and [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]]. [[Naman Sharma]] and [[Meghnad Saha]], from Dacca ([[Dhaka]]), joined the same college two years later. [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis]] and [[Sisir Kumar Mitra]] were a few years senior to Bose. Bose chose mixed (applied) mathematics for his BSc and passed the examinations standing first in 1913 and again stood first in the MSc mixed mathematics exam in 1915. It is said that his marks in the MSc examination created a new record in the annals of the University of Calcutta, which is yet to be surpassed.&lt;ref name = "kamble"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/dream/jan2002/article1.htm | title = Vigyan Prasar| first = Dr VB | last = Kamble |date=January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his MSc, Bose joined the [[University of Calcutta]] as a research scholar in 1916 and started his studies in the [[theory of relativity]]. It was an exciting era in the history of scientific progress. [[Old quantum theory|Quantum theory]] had just appeared on the horizon and important results had started pouring in.&lt;ref name="kamble" /&gt;

His father, Surendranath Bose, worked in the Engineering Department of the [[East Indian Railway Company]]. In 1914, at age 20, Satyendra Nath Bose married Ushabati Ghosh,&lt;ref name="SNB Project"/&gt;{{sfn| Wali| 2009| p= xvii}} the 11-year-old daughter of a prominent Calcutta physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Masters, Barry R. |url=http://newweb.bose.res.in/Prof.S.N.Bose-Archive/objects/Masters-Bose.pdf |title=Satyendra Nath Bose and Bose-Einstein Statistics|date=April 2013|journal= Optics &amp; Photonics News|volume=24 |issue=4 |page=41|bibcode=2013OptPN..24...40M |doi=10.1364/OPN.24.4.000040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had nine children, two of whom died in early childhood. When he died in 1974, he left behind his wife, two sons, and five daughters.&lt;ref name="kamble" /&gt;

As a [[Polyglotism|polyglot]], Bose was well versed in several languages such as [[Bengali language|Bengali]], English, French, German and [[Sanskrit]] as well as the poetry of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Kālidāsa|Kalidasa]]. He could play the ''[[esraj]]'', an Indian musical instrument similar to a violin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vigyan Prasar – SC Bose|url=http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/snbose/bosenew.htm|website=www.vigyanprasar.gov.in|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was actively involved in running night schools that came to be known as the Working Men's Institute.&lt;ref name= SMahanti /&gt;{{sfn | Wali | 2009| p= xvi}}

==Research career==
Bose attended [[Hindu School]] in Calcutta, and later [[List of Kolkata Presidencians|attended]] [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]], also in Calcutta, earning the highest marks at each institution, while fellow student and future astrophysicist [[Meghnad Saha]] came second.&lt;ref name = SMahanti&gt;{{cite web | first =Dr Subodh  | last = Mahanti | place = [[India|IN]] |title=Satyendra Nath Bose, The Creator of Quantum Statistics |url=http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/snbose/bosenew.htm |publisher=Vigyan Prasar}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came in contact with teachers such as [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]], Prafulla Chandra Ray and Naman Sharma who provided inspiration to aim high in life. From 1916 to 1921, he was a lecturer in the [[Academic department|physics department]] of the [[University of Calcutta]]. Along with Saha, Bose prepared the first book in English based on German and French translations of original papers on Einstein's special and general relativity in 1919. In 1921, he joined as [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] of the department of Physics of the recently founded [[University of Dhaka]] (in present-day Bangladesh).&lt;ref name=Banglapedia&gt;{{citation

Satyendra Nath Bose, along with Saha, presented several papers in theoretical physics and pure mathematics from 1918 onwards. In 1924, while working as a Reader (Professor without a chair) at the Physics Department of the [[University of Dhaka]], Bose wrote a paper deriving [[Planck's law|Planck's quantum radiation law]] without any reference to [[classical physics]] by using a novel way of counting states with identical particles. This paper was seminal in creating the very important field of [[quantum statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF03010400|url=http://hermes.ffn.ub.es/luisnavarro/nuevo_maletin/Bose_1924.pdf|bibcode=1994JApA...15....3B|title=Planck's Law and the Light Quantum Hypothesis|journal=Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy|volume=15|pages=3–7|last1=Bose|first1=S.

Einstein, recognising the importance of the paper, translated it into German himself and submitted it on Bose's behalf to the prestigious ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]''. As a result of this recognition, Bose was able to work for two years in European X-ray and crystallography laboratories, during which he worked with [[Louis de Broglie]], [[Marie Curie]], and Einstein.&lt;ref name= SMahanti/&gt;&lt;ref name="shanbhag"&gt;{{cite web | first = MR | last = Shanbhag | work = Personalities | title = Scientist | url = http://www.calcuttaweb.com/people/snbose.shtml | publisher = Calcutta web | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20020802081628/http://www.calcuttaweb.com/people/snbose.shtml | archivedate = 2 August 2002 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "OConnorRobertson"&gt;{{cite web | first1 =JJ | last1 = O'Connor | first2 = EF | last2 = Robertson |date= October 2003 |title= Satyendranath Bose |url= http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bose.html | publisher= St Andrew's | work = The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive | place = UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wali|2009|pp = xx–xxiii}}

===Bose–Einstein statistics===
[[File:Bose letter.jpg|thumb|left|Bose's letter to Einstein]]
While presenting a lecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =MR | last = Shanbhag |title= Satyendra Nath Bose (January 1, 1894 – February 4, 1974) | url=http://www.isical.ac.in/~econophys/bose.html |publisher=Indian Statistical Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Dhaka]] on the theory of [[radiation]] and the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], Bose intended to show his students that the contemporary theory was inadequate, because it predicted results not in accordance with experimental results.

In the process of describing this discrepancy, Bose for the first time took the position that the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] would not be true for microscopic particles, where fluctuations due to [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] will be significant. Thus he stressed the probability of finding particles in the [[phase space]], each state having volume {{math|''h''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and discarding the distinct position and [[momentum]] of the particles.

Bose adapted this lecture into a short article called "Planck's Law and the Hypothesis of Light Quanta" and sent it to [[Albert Einstein]] with the following letter:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Bose And His Statistics | first =G | last = Venkataraman |page=14 | publisher =Universities Press |year=1992 |isbn= 978-81-7371-036-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Respected Sir, I have ventured to send you the accompanying article for your perusal and opinion. I am anxious to know what you think of it. You will see that I have tried to deduce the coefficient {{math|8π ν&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''c''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} in Planck's Law independent of classical electrodynamics, only assuming that the ultimate elementary region in the phase-space has the content {{math |''h''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. I do not know sufficient German to translate the paper. If you think the paper worth publication I shall be grateful if you arrange for its publication in ''Zeitschrift für Physik''. Though a complete stranger to you, I do not feel any hesitation in making such a request. Because we are all your pupils though profiting only by your teachings through your writings. I do not know whether you still remember that somebody from Calcutta asked your permission to translate your papers on Relativity in English. You acceded to the request. The book has since been published. I was the one who translated your paper on Generalised Relativity.}}

Einstein agreed with him, translated Bose's paper "Planck's Law and Hypothesis of Light Quanta" into German, and had it published in ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' under Bose's name, in 1924.{{sfn|Wali|2009|p= 414}}

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The reason Bose's interpretation produced accurate results was that since photons are indistinguishable from each other, one cannot treat any two photons having equal energy as being two distinct identifiable photons. By analogy, if in an alternate universe coins were to behave like photons and other [[boson]]s, the probability of producing two heads would indeed be one-third (tail-head = head-tail).

Bose's interpretation is now called [[Bose–Einstein statistics]]. This result derived by Bose laid the foundation of [[quantum statistics]], and especially the revolutionary new philosophical conception of the indistinguishability of particles, as acknowledged by Einstein and Dirac.{{sfn|Wali|2009|p= 414}} When Einstein met Bose face-to-face, he asked him whether he had been aware that he had invented a new type of statistics, and he very candidly said that no, he wasn't that familiar with [[Boltzmann]]'s statistics and didn't realize that he was doing the calculations differently. He was equally candid with anyone who asked.

====Bose–Einstein condensate====

Center: just after the appearance of the condensate. Right: after further evaporation, leaving a sample of nearly pure condensate.]]

Einstein also did not at first realize how radical Bose's departure was, and in his first paper after Bose, he was guided, like Bose, by the fact that the new method gave the right answer. But after Einstein's second paper using Bose's method in which Einstein predicted the Bose–Einstein condensate (''pictured left''), he started to realize just how radical it was, and he compared it to wave/particle duality, saying that some particles didn't behave exactly like particles.  Bose had already submitted his article to the British Journal ''Philosophical Magazine'', which rejected it, before he sent it to Einstein. It is not known why it was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;A.Douglas Stone, Chapter 24, ''The Indian Comet'', in the book ''Einstein and the Quantum'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein adopted the idea and extended it to atoms. This led to the prediction of the existence of phenomena which became known as [[Bose–Einstein condensate]], a dense collection of [[boson]]s (which are particles with integer [[spin (physics)|spin]], named after Bose), which was demonstrated to exist by experiment in 1995.

===Dhaka===
[[File:Satyendra-nath-bose.jpg|thumb|Bose at Dhaka University in the 1930s]]
After his stay in Europe, Bose returned to Dhaka in 1926. He did not have a doctorate, and so ordinarily, under the prevailing regulations, he would not be qualified for the post of Professor he applied for, but Einstein recommended him. He was then made [[Chair (official)|Head]] of the Department of Physics at [[Dhaka University]]. He continued guiding and teaching at Dhaka University.

Bose designed equipment himself for an [[X-ray crystallography]] laboratory. He set up laboratories and libraries to make the department a center of research in X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, magnetic properties of matter, optical spectroscopy, wireless, and [[Unified field theory|unified field theories]]. He also published an [[equation of state]] for [[real gas]]es with [[Meghnad Saha]]. He was also the [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the Faculty of Science at Dhaka University until 1945.

===Calcutta===
When the [[partition of India]] became imminent (1947), he returned to Calcutta and taught there until 1956. He insisted every student design his own equipment using local materials and local technicians. He was made [[Emeritus|professor emeritus]] on his retirement.&lt;ref name="shanbhag"/&gt;{{sfn|Wali|2009|pp = xxx, xxiv}}&lt;ref name=SMahanti/&gt; He then became Vice-Chancellor of [[Visva-Bharati University]] in [[Santiniketan]]. He returned to the University of Calcutta to continue research in nuclear physics and complete earlier works in organic chemistry. In subsequent years, he worked in applied research such as extraction of [[helium]] in hot springs of [[Bakreshwar]].{{sfn|Wali|2009|pp =xxxvi, xxxviii}}

===Other fields===
Apart from physics, he did some research in [[biotechnology]] and literature ([[Bengali literature|Bengali]] and English). He made deep studies in [[chemistry]], geology, [[zoology]], [[anthropology]], engineering and other sciences. Being [[Bengali people|Bengali]], he devoted a lot of time to promoting [[Bengali language|Bengali]] as a teaching language, translating scientific papers into it, and promoting the development of the region.&lt;ref name="OConnorRobertson"/&gt;{{sfn|Wali|2009|pp =xxiv, xxxix}}&lt;ref name=Biography&gt;{{Citation | title = Science world | url = http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Bose.html | contribution = Bose, Satyendranath (1894–1974) | type = biography | first = Michel | last = Barran | publisher = Wolfram}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, [[Rabindranath Tagore]] dedicated his only book on science, ''Visva–Parichay'', to Satyendra Nath Bose. Bose was honoured with title [[Padma Vibhushan]] by the Indian Government in 1954. In 1959, he was appointed as the National Professor, the highest honour in the country for a scholar, a position he held for 15 years. In 1986, the [[S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences]] was established by an act of Parliament, Government of India, in Salt Lake, Calcutta.{{sfn| Wali| 2009 | pp = xxxiv, xxxviii}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120103/jsp/opinion/story_14952697.jsp#.T4BeL3qKZWM | title = Original vision | first = Partha | last = Ghose | date = 3 January 2012 | newspaper = The Telegraph | place = [[India|IN]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bose became an adviser to then newly formed [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]].  He was the President of [[Indian Physical Society]] and the National Institute of Science. He was elected General President of the [[Indian Science Congress]]. He was the Vice-President and then the President of Indian Statistical Institute.  In 1958, he became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]].  He was nominated as member of [[Rajya Sabha]].

[[Partha Ghose]] has stated that&lt;ref name=SMahanti/&gt;

==Nobel Prize nomination==

S.N. Bose was nominated by K. Banerji (1956), D.S. Kothari (1959), S.N. Bagchi (1962) and A.K. Dutta (1962) for the Nobel Prize in Physics, for his contribution to Bose–Einstein statistics and the unified field theory. For instance, Kedareswar Banerjee, head of the Physics Department, University of Allahabad, in a letter of 12 January 1956 wrote to the Nobel Committee as follows: “(1). He (Bose) made very outstanding contributions to Physics by developing the statistics known after his name as Bose statistics. In recent years this statistics is found to be of profound importance in the classifications of fundamental particles and has contributed immensely in the development of nuclear physics. (2). During the period from 1953 to date he has made a number of highly interesting contributions of far-reaching consequences on the subject of Einstein’s Unitary Field Theory.” Bose's work was evaluated by an expert of the Nobel Committee, [[Oskar Klein]], who did not see his work worthy of a Nobel Prize.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Rajinder (2016) ''India's Nobel Prize Nominators and Nominees – The Praxis of Nomination and Geographical Distribution'', Shaker Publisher, Aachen, pp. 26–27. {{ISBN|978-3-8440-4315-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Rajinder (2016) ''Die Nobelpreise und die indische Elite'', Shaker Verlag, Aachen, pp. 24–25. {{ISBN|978-3-8440-4429-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Rajinder (2016) ''Chemistry and Physics Nobel Prizes – India's Contribution'', Shaker Verlag, Aachen. {{ISBN|978-3-8440-4669-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Satyendranath Bose 1994 stamp of India.jpg|thumb|Bose on a 1994 stamp of India]]
[[Bosons]], a class of elementary [[Subatomic particle|subatomic]] particles in [[particle physics]] were named after Satyendra Nath Bose to commemorate his contributions to science.&lt;ref name="AP-20120710"&gt;{{cite news |last=Daigle |first=Katy |title=India: Enough about Higgs, let's discuss the boson |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20120710/D9VU1DRG0.html |date=10 July 2012 |newspaper=[[AP News]] |accessdate=10 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20120919"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bal |first=Hartosh Singh |title=The Bose in the Boson |url= http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/indians-clamor-for-credit-for-the-bose-in-boson/ |date=19 September 2012 |work=[[New York Times]] blog |accessdate=21 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several Nobel Prizes were awarded for research related to the concepts of the [[boson]], [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] and [[Bose–Einstein condensate]], Bose himself was not awarded a Nobel Prize.

In his book ''The Scientific Edge'', physicist [[Jayant Narlikar]] observed: {{quote |SN Bose's work on particle statistics (c. 1922), which clarified the behaviour of [[photon]]s (the [[Elementary particle|particles]] of light in an enclosure) and opened the door to new ideas on statistics of Microsystems that obey the rules of quantum theory, was one of the top ten achievements of 20th century Indian science and could be considered in the Nobel Prize class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jayant V | last = Narlikar | year = 2003 | title = The Scientific Edge: The Indian Scientist from Vedic to Modern Times | publisher = Penguin Books | isbn = 978-0-14-303028-7 | page = 127}}.  The work of other 20th century Indian scientists which Narlikar considered to be of Nobel Prize class were [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]], [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman]] and [[Megh Nad Saha]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote | When Bose himself was once asked that question, he simply replied, "I have got all the recognition I deserve"— probably because in the realms of science to which he belonged, what is important is not a Nobel, but whether one's name will live on in scientific discussions in the decades to come.&lt;ref name= outlook-in-bose&gt;{{cite news| last= Alikhan| first= Anvar| title= The Spark in a Crowded Field|url= http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?281539|accessdate= 10 July 2012| newspaper= Outlook India | date = 16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A '''Scott-T transformer'''  (also called a '''Scott connection''') is a type of circuit used to produce [[two-phase electric power]] (&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;φ, 90&amp;nbsp;degree phase rotation)&lt;ref name=GET-2485T&gt;{{cite book |title=Distribution Transformer Manual, GET-2485T |year=1996 |publisher=General Electric Company |location=Hickory, NC |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; from a [[three-phase]] (&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;φ, 120&amp;nbsp;degree phase rotation) source, or vice versa. The Scott connection evenly distributes a balanced load between the phases of the source. The Scott three-phase [[transformer]] was invented by a [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] engineer [[Charles F. Scott (engineer)|Charles F. Scott]] in the late 1890s to bypass [[Thomas Edison]]'s more expensive [[rotary converter]] and thereby permit two-phase generator plants to drive three-phase motors.&lt;ref name=Passer&gt;{{cite book |author=Passer, Harold C. |title=The Electrical Manufacturers, 1875-1900 |publisher=Harvard |year=1953 |page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interconnection==
At the time of the invention, two-phase motor loads also existed and the Scott connection allowed connecting them to newer three-phase supplies with the currents equal on the three phases.&lt;ref name="All About Circuits"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_2/chpt_9/7.html |title=All About Circuits |access-date=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was valuable for getting equal voltage drop and thus feasible [[Voltage regulation|regulation of the voltage]] from the [[electric generator]] (the phases cannot be varied separately in a three-phase machine). [[Nikola Tesla]]'s original [[polyphase system|polyphase power system]] was based on simple-to-build two-phase four-wire components. However, as transmission distances increased, the more transmission-line efficient three-phase system became more common. (Three phase power can be transmitted with only three wires, where the two-phase power systems required four wires, two per phase.) Both 2&amp;nbsp;φ and 3&amp;nbsp;φ components coexisted for a number of years and the Scott-T transformer connection allowed them to be interconnected.

==Technical details==
[[File:Scott-T.JPG|thumb|400px|Standard Scott Connection 3&amp;nbsp;φ to 2&amp;nbsp;φ]]
Assuming the desired voltage is the same on the two and three phase sides, the Scott-T transformer connection (shown right) consists of a centre-tapped 1:1 ratio main transformer, T1, and a {{radic|3}}/2 (≈86.6%) ratio teaser transformer, T2. The centre-tapped side of T1 is connected between two of the phases on the three-phase side. Its centre tap then connects to one end of the lower turn count side of T2, the other end connects to the remaining phase. The other side of the transformers then connect directly to the two pairs of a two-phase four-wire system.

===Unbalanced loads===
Two-phase motors draw constant power, just as three-phase motors do, so a balanced two-phase load is converted to a balanced three-phase load. However if a two-phase load is not balanced (more power drawn from one phase than the other), no arrangement of transformers (including the Scott-T transformers) can restore balance: Unbalanced current on the two-phase side causes unbalanced current on the three-phase side. Since the typical two-phase load was a motor, the current in the two phases was presumed inherently equal during the Scott-T development.

In modern times people have tried to revive the Scott connection as a way to power [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] [[Railway electrification system|electric railways]] from three-phase Utility supplies. This will not result in balanced current on the three-phase side, as it is unlikely that two different railway sections, each connected as two-phase, will at all times conform to the Scott presumption of being equal. The instantaneous difference in loading on the two sections will be seen as an imbalance in the three-phase supply; there is no way to smooth it out with transformers.&lt;ref name=AIEE&gt;{{cite journal |journal=AIEE Transactions |date=Jan 1957 |pages=432-445 |author=General Electric |title=(unknown)}} The cited article is a GE paper which points out that railway unbalance, even via Scott-T transformers, affects generators, the motors of other customers and presumably delta connected transformers. Even small unbalances can cause heating. However, because electric systems have grown larger over the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, the paper suggests that the railways are now a tolerable load, provided one has a confirming system analysis. Scott-T transformers may not even be relevant, since direct line-to-line load connections may be sufficient. So this leaves a potential solution, but the single-phase load should then be viewed as being ''tolerated'', not ''balanced''. Allowing it also raises the question: “''What if other customers asked for the same toleration?''”&lt;/ref&gt;

===Back to back arrangement===
[[File:Scott t 3 phase.png|thumb|400px|Scott Connection 3&amp;nbsp;φ to 3&amp;nbsp;φ]]
The Scott-T transformer connection may be also be used in a back-to-back T-to-T arrangement for a three-phase to three-phase connection. This is a cost-saving in the lower-power transformers due to the two-coil T connected to a secondary two-coil T instead of the traditional three-coil primary to three-coil secondary transformer. In this arrangement the X0 neutral tap is part way up on the secondary teaser transformer (see right). The voltage stability of this T-to-T arrangement as compared to the traditional three-coil primary to three-coil secondary transformer is questioned, as the "per unit" impedance of the two windings (primary and secondary, respectively) ''are not'' the same in a T-to-T configuration, whereas the three windings (primary and secondary, respectively) ''are'' the same in a three transformer configuration, if the three transformers are identical.

Three-phase to three-phase (also called "T-connected") distribution transformers are seeing increasing applications. The primary ''must'' be [[delta (letter)|delta]]-connected (&amp;Delta;), but the secondary ''may be'' either delta or “wye”-connected ([[Y (letter)|Y]]), at the customer's option, with X0 providing the neutral for the “wye” case. Taps for either case are usually provided. The customary maximum capacity of such a distribution transformer is 333&amp;nbsp;kV&amp;nbsp;A (a third of a megawatt).

Used primarily in [[aviation]], '''self-sealing''' is a technology—in wide use since [[World War II]]—that prevents [[fuel tanks]] or [[fuel bladder|bladders]] from leaking fuel and igniting after being damaged by enemy fire.

Typical self-sealing tanks have multiple layers of [[rubber]] and reinforcing fabric, one of [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] rubber, and one of untreated natural rubber, which can absorb fuel, swell, and expand when it comes into contact with the fuel. When a fuel tank is punctured, the fuel seeps into the layers, causing the untreated layer to swell and thus seal the puncture.

==World War I==
George J. Murdock applied for the patent "War Aeroplane Fuel Tanks" on February 7, 1917 but was temporarily blocked by an order of the [[Federal Trade Commission]], on February 6, 1918, to keep any discussion or publication of the invention secret.&lt;!-- This order was in conformity with the provisions of the [[Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917|Trading with the Enemy Act]] and of the Executive Order of October 12, 1917. Violation of the order entailed a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment of 10 years or both.--&gt; The order was rescinded by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|United States Patent Office]] on September 26, 1918 and Murdock was eventually granted United States Patent 1,386,791 "Self-Puncture Sealing Covering for Fuel-Containers" on August 9, 1921. Military aircraft built by the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] used this self-sealing fuel tank.

==World War II==
In the newer generations of pre-war and early-war aircraft, self-sealing tanks were tanks used to minimize the damage from leaking or burning [[fuel]]. A conventional fuel tank, when hit by gunfire, could leak fuel rapidly. This would not only reduce the aircraft's effective range, but was also a significant fire hazard. Damaged fuel tanks could also rupture, destroying the [[airframe]] or critically affecting [[Flight dynamics|flight characteristics]].

It was realized that, because of weight limitations, it was not practical to simply add armor plate to aircraft fuel tanks; a method of stopping fuel leaking from damaged tanks was necessary.

Early attempts at protecting fuel tanks consisted of using metal tanks, covered inside or outside by a material that expanded after being pierced. Research revealed that the ''exit'' of the projectile, rather than the entry, was the greater problem, as it often tumbled, thus creating a large exit hole. Among the earliest versions of these types of tanks were those manufactured in the UK at [[Portsmouth]] airport by [[FPT Industries|Fireproof Tanks Ltd]]. These tanks were first installed in the [[Fairey Battle]] light bomber with other versions installed in [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters and larger aircraft such as the [[Avro Lancaster]] heavy bomber. The Henderson Safety Tank company provided crash-proof self-sealing tanks for the [[Miles Master]] trainer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1940/1940%20-%202064.html|title=fuel tanks - henderson system - airscrew spinners - 1940 - 2064 - Flight Archive|work=flightglobal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans were using layers of rubber laid over leather hide with a treated fibre inner surface for the self-sealing tanks on their [[Junkers Ju 88]] bombers early in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1940/1940%20-%203430.html |title=the Ingenious Ju-88 |journal=Flight |year=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Manufacture of self-sealing gas tanks, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.jpg|thumb|Manufacture of self-sealing gas tanks at Goodyear (1941)]]

In the [[United States of America|US]], Ernst Eger of [[United States Rubber Company]] (later [[Uniroyal]]) patented&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US2401627 Puncture Sealing Gas Tank]&lt;/ref&gt; a self-sealing fuel tank design in 1941; one of many companies involved in developing this technology during the war. [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] chemist James Merrill filed a [[patent]] in 1941 (published in 1947) for refining and successfully testing his method for manufacturing self-sealing tanks using a two-layer system of rubber compounds encased in a metal outer shell or the wing lining of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference|number=2424701 |y=1947 |m=07|d=29 |inventor=Merrill |title=Fuel tank casing}} [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/2424701 USPTO text and images]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, he received a War Production Board citation from President Roosevelt and the Goodyear tanks were subsequently placed in service in Goodyear-produced [[F4U Corsair|Corsair]] fighters, as well as other aircraft. By 1942 Fireproof Tanks had developed the first flexible fuel bladders as range extender tanks for the Mk IX Spitfire. These tanks were flexible containers, made of a laminated self-sealing material like [[vulcanized rubber]] and with as few seams as possible to minimize leak paths.

As early tests showed that impact could overpressurize a fuel tank, the self-sealing fuel cell is suspended, allowing it to absorb shocks without rupture. [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] fuel tanks during the war were able to withstand {{convert|.50|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} bullets and, on occasion, [[20 mm caliber|{{convert|20|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}]] [[Autocannon|cannon]] shells.

Not all fighters were fitted with the relatively new invention. Self-sealing tanks tended to be heavier with lower capacity than non-sealed tanks. Nonetheless, aircraft that were fitted with self-sealing tanks regularly took more punishment than those without, and were able to return to base. Combat experience in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific war]] showed that the heavily protected American aircraft could sustain far more damage than the lightly armored Japanese designs without self-sealing fuel tanks (for instance, the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]).

The same principles were applied to give self-sealing fuel lines in aircraft (MIL-PRF-7061C).

==Modern use==
Most [[Fighter aircraft|jet fighter]]s and all [[List of United States military helicopters|US military rotary wing aircraft]] have some type of self-sealing tanks. Military rotary wing fuel tanks have the additional feature of being [[Crashworthiness|crashworthy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA401697&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf A Study of Helicopter Crash-Resistant Fuel Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; High altitudes require the tanks to be pressurized, making self-sealing difficult. Newer technologies have brought advances like inert [[Ballistic foam|foam-filled]] tanks to prevent detonation. This foam is an open cell foam that effectively divides the gas space above the remaining fuel into thousands of small spaces, none of which contain sufficient vapour to support combustion. This foam also serves to reduce fuel [[slosh]]. Major manufacturers of this technology include Hutchinson, Amfuel ([[Zodiac Aerospace|Zodiac]]) (formerly [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]]), [[Meggitt]] (formerly [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]]), Robertson Fuel Systems, [[GKN]] USA, and [[FPT Industries]].  FPT is now part of GKN.&lt;ref name="GKN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fptind.co.uk/about-gkn-portsmouth.html|title=About GKN (Company History - Portsmouth)|accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For military use, tanks are qualified to MIL-DTL-27422 (includes [[crashworthiness]] requirements) or MIL-DTL-5578 (non-crashworthy). An aircraft fuel tank sometimes consists of several interconnected fuel cells. The interconnecting hoses are typically also self-sealing.&lt;ref name="UH-60 handbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aasf3-ny.org/4-Standards/Documents/PUBLICATIONS/StudentHandouts/UH60%20Fuel%20System.pdf|title=UH-60A Student Handbook|publisher=United States Army Warfighting Center|year=2008|accessdate=December 5, 2011|pages=D-3|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105193150/http://aasf3-ny.org/4-Standards/Documents/PUBLICATIONS/StudentHandouts/UH60%20Fuel%20System.pdf|archivedate=January 5, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to fighter aircraft some military patrol vehicles and armoured VIP limousines feature self-sealing fuel tanks.
                                                                      
Self-sealing fuel tanks using military technology are also required in some [[motorsport]] categories.

The '''sustainable yield''' of [[natural capital]] is the [[ecological yield]] that can be extracted without reducing the base of capital itself, i.e. the [[Economic surplus|surplus]] required to maintain [[ecosystem services]] at the same or increasing level over time.  This yield usually varies over time with the needs of the [[ecosystem]] to maintain itself, e.g. a [[forest]] that has recently suffered a [[blight]] or [[flooding]] or [[fire]] will require more of its own ecological yield to sustain and re-establish a mature forest.  While doing so, the sustainable yield may be much less.

In forestry terms it is the largest amount of harvest activity that can occur without degrading the productivity of the stock.

[[File:Net fishing professionally 0544990019 KALFA.jpg|thumb| Fishery management utilizes the concept of sustainable yield to determine how much fish can be removed, so that the population remains sustainable.]]

This concept is important in fishery management, in which sustainable yield is defined as the number of fish that can be extracted without reducing the base of fish stock, and the [[maximum sustainable yield]] is defined as the amount of fish that can be extracted under given environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ricker|first=W.E.|date=1975|title=Computation and Interpretation of Biological Statistics of Fish Populations|journal=Bulletin of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada|volume=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fisheries, the basic natural capital or virgin population, must decrease with extraction. At the same time productivity increases. Hence, sustainable yield would be within the range in which the natural capital together with its production are able to provide satisfactory yield. It may be very difficult to quantify sustainable yield, because every dynamic ecological conditions and other factors  not  related to harvesting induce changes and fluctuations in both, the natural capital and its productivity.

In the case of [[groundwater]] there is a safe yield of water extraction per unit time, beyond which the [[aquifer]] risks the state of [[overdrafting]] or even depletion.

==Biography==
===Early life and career in military===
Syed Ali Nawab was born in [[Budaun]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] in [[British Indian Empire|British India]], into an [[Urdu-speaking]] family on 6 October 1925.{{rp|58}}&lt;ref name="Alumni Directory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aligarh Muslim University - Alumni Directory|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/78291282/Aligarh-Muslim-University-Alumni-Directory#scribd|website=Scribd|publisher=Alumni Directory|accessdate=7 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was married to Razia Jaffery, an Army Captain and graduate of [[King Edward Medical College]] who belonged to a family from [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. Nawab went to attend [[Aligarh Muslim University]] (AMU) after his matriculation in 1941–43.{{rp|58–59}}&lt;ref name="Alumni Directory"/&gt; He initially studied [[physics]] and graduated with [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] in physics in 1946, before attending the engineering college.{{rp|58–59}}&lt;ref name="Alumni Directory"/&gt; In 1948, he graduated with [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[electrical engineering]] and [[Immigration to Pakistan|emigrated]] to [[Pakistan]] in 1949.{{rp|58–59}}&lt;ref name="Alumni Directory"/&gt; In 1950, he joined the [[Pakistan Military Academy]] (PMA) in [[Kakul]], and graduated at the top of his class.{{rp|59}}&lt;ref name="Alumni Directory"/&gt;

In 1951, Nawab was [[commissioned officer|commissioned]] in the [[Pakistan Army]]'s [[Pakistan Army Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering|Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering]] (PEME) and was one of the few army officers directed by the [[Pakistani military]] to attend the [[Loughborough University]] where he gained [[Master of Science|MSc]] in [[mechanical engineering]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="The News International (Part - VIII)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khan|first1=Dr. A.Q.|title=Unsung heroes: Random Thoughts (Part - VIII)|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/521486-unsung-heroes|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=www.thenews.com.pk|agency=The News International|publisher=The News International, AQ Khan|date=25 August 1925|location=Islamabad|language=en-pk|quote={{small|Col Qazi was one of the early batches sent by the army to Loughborough University for Engineering.

Upon returning to Pakistan in 1954, [[Major]] Nawab was appointed as [[inspector]] of vehicle and engineering equipment in the [[Pakistan Army]], having responsible for quality inspection and equipment for the military vehicles.{{rp|104}}&lt;ref name="The Institution of Mechanical Engineering. 1954"/&gt; In 1955–56, Major Nawab was later posted in the [[GHQ (Pakistan Army)|Army GHQ]] as a controller of inspection and technical development.{{rp|104}}&lt;ref name="The Institution of Mechanical Engineering. 1954"/&gt;

In 1957–60, Major Nawab was first directed to attend the [[Royal Military College of Science]] in [[Shrivenham]] in [[England]] to study [[machine design]] [[Machine element|components]] on the military vehicles, and was then sent to attend the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], the [[United States Army]] facility, located in [[Maryland]], in the [[United States]].{{rp|44}}&lt;ref name="Mechanical Engineering Publications Limited, 1960"/&gt; At the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] in [[Maryland]], Major Nawab attended the Ordnance Officer Career Course, and qualified as an [[wikt:ordnance|ordnance]] specialist.{{rp|44}}&lt;ref name="Mechanical Engineering Publications Limited, 1960"/&gt;

In 1960–64, [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] Nawab was appointed assistant director of the EME director at the [[GHQ (Pakistan Army)|Army GHQ]].{{rp|44;99}}&lt;ref name="Mechanical Engineering Publications Limited, 1960"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chartered Mechanical Engineer|date=1960|publisher=Mechanical Engineering Publications Limited|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Has7AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Syed+Ali+Nawab+mechanical&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Syed+Ali+Nawab|accessdate=8 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, [[Lieutenant-Colonel|Lt-Col.]] Nawab participated in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|second war]] with [[India]], responsible for managing military ordnance and inspections of the military vehicles.

In 1965, [[Colonel]] Nawab was directed by the [[Minister of Defence (Pakistan)|Minister of Defence]] (MoD) to join the staff of the [[High Commission of Pakistan, London|High Commission]] of Pakistan in [[London]] as a military [[liaison officer]] for the [[British Army]].{{rp|43}}&lt;ref name="H.M.

Stationery Office, 1983"/&gt;
{{rp|43}}&lt;ref name="H.M. Stationery Office, 1970"/&gt;

===Postwar career===

After the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|third war]] with India in 1971, [[Colonel|Col.]] Nawab was posted back at the [[Pakistan Army Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering|Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering]] as an inspector-general for inspection for the military equipment and vehicles at the [[GHQ (Pakistan Army)|Army GHQ]], later promoted as [[One star rank|one-star]] rank general, [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]], in 1972–75.

In 1975, Nawab was promoted to the rank of two star or Major General as DG Military Vehicles Research and Development Establishment.&lt;ref&gt;https://defence.pk/pdf/threads/pakistan-military-vehicles-research-and-development-establishment-mvrde-achievements-for-armed-for.437449/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Prime Minister Bhutto]] had placed the nuclear weapons project directly under Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan's control rather than the Army, Nawab's first appointment as a Major General was in the Ministry of Defense as DG MVRDE in 1975, where he could work directly with the newly appointed Secretary of Defense, Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan at the Ministry of Defense without arousing suspicion

Nawab was transferred to the position of Director General [[Pakistan Army Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering|Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering]] (EME) on May 6, 1976 until 6 December 1976.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Army Museum"&gt;{{cite web|last1=army museum|first1=armymuseum|title=DIRECTOR GENERALS OF EME|url=http://www.pakarmymuseum.com/exhibits/director-generals-of-eme/|website=www.pakarmymuseum.com|publisher=Pakistan Army Museum|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, then-[[Defence Secretary of Pakistan|Defence Secretary]] [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] directed Major-General Nawab to supervise the establishing of [[Engineering Research Laboratories]] (ERL); and made him responsible for procuring metallurgical equipments, [[Ore|elemental ores]], and [[metalworking]] that was crucial for scientific and research work at the ERL.&lt;ref name="News International, Khan 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khan|first1=AQ|title=An indomitable man: Ghulam Ishaq Khan|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/21756-an-indomitable-man|accessdate=8 November 2017|work=www.thenews.com.pk|agency=News International|publisher=News International|date=2 February 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zia ul Haq|General Zia]] who was recently promoted to COAS on March 1, 1976 was instructed by the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Ghulam Ishaq Khan to transfer Nawab to the post of DG EME in the Army so Nawab could perform these functions and use his British connections to the [[British Ministry of Defence]] to import and procure industrial equipments, and the [[computerized numerical control]] machines from the [[United Kingdom]] that were installed in the ERL.&lt;ref name="News International, Khan 2015"/&gt;

At the ERL, Nawab established the [[machine shop]] at the ERL, and was noted among the civilian scientists as competent [[mechanical engineer]] and able machinist, while working on the [[machine design]] [[Machine element|components]] that were crucial for the feasibility of the [[Zippe-type centrifuge|gas centrifuges]], where Nawab designed and built the machine components using the [[lathe]], [[drill press]], [[bandsaw]], and the [[CNC machine]]s.&lt;ref name="News International, Khan 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=Houston|first2=Alexander|last2=Glasser|first3=Scott|last3=Kemp|title=The gas centrifuge and nuclear weapons proliferation|journal=Physics Today|volume=September|pages=40–45|year=2008|doi=10.1063/1.2982121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/61/9/10.1063/1.2982121&lt;/ref&gt; Major-General Nawab officiated his role towards establishing the engineering branch at the [[Kahuta Research Laboratories|KRL]] as a senior engineer and researcher while partially completing the engineering staffing composed of EME army officers.{{rp|157–158}}&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press, Khan 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khan|first1=Feroz Hassan|title=Eating Grass: The making of the Pakistani bomb|date=2012|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Palo Alto|isbn=9780804784801|pages=401|edition=1st|url=|language=en-us|format=google books|chapter={{small|Mastery of Uranium Enrichment}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major-General Nawab also used his influence as DG EME in carefully selecting and deputing EME officers as to be posted as military liaison officers and staff at the Office of Military Procurement (PALTO) that was used by the ERL at the [[High Commission of Pakistan, London|High Commission of Pakistan]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="News International, AQ Khan :Part - XVI" /&gt; All this was done clandestinely, without [[Abdul Qadeer Khan|Dr A.Q. Khan]] knowing that Nawab was actually DG EME to maintain deniability. Brigadier Islamullah Khan of EME assisted in maintaining the clandestine aspect of this operation and in building ERL. He as well as other EME officers who assisted were recommended and later promoted to the rank of Major General.

In 1977–78, Major-General Nawab was moved to be appointed as [[Chairman]] of [[Pakistan Ordnance Factories]] (POF) but remain associated with his work at the ERL.&lt;ref name="The News International, 2015 Part XV"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khan|first1=AQ|title=RANDOM THOUGHTS : Unsung Heroes (Part XV)|url=http://www.sapulse.com/new_comments.php?id=9404_0_1_370_M1|accessdate=10 November 2017|work=South Asian Pulse|agency=The News International|publisher=www.sapulse.com|date=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; COAS General [[Zia ul Haq|Zia]] was instructed by Secretary Defence, Ghulam Ishaq Khan to recommend this transfer. Nawab used his appointment at POFs to make additional personnel allocations to ERL and to procure ores of [[natural uranium|uranium]] in the country, and relocating them at a secure location for the expansion of nuclear infrastructure.&lt;ref name="The News International, 2015 Part XV"/&gt;

In 1978, during [[Zia ul Haq|General Zia's]] military regime, Major-General Nawab was superseded from his rank, as junior officers were promoted to higher ranks. However, Nawab was given an extension of three years to resume his classified works with the KRL.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. This was unsurprising since [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Prime Minister Bhutto]] and [[Tikka Khan|General Tikka Khan]] had both been jailed; and Nawab's boss Defense Secretary [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] was moved to the Ministry of Finance. Subsequently, Ghulam Ishaq Khan had to bring Zia up to speed on details of the project and convince Zia to give Nawab the extension.

In 1981, Major-General Nawab again provided a crucial technical support when he assisted the KRL scientists in redesigning, and eventually machining of the [[gyration]]al beds and [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing components]] of the [[gas centrifuge]]s with the goal of developing powerful and effective methods of gaseous method that were employed in the [[Uranium enrichment]].{{rp|157–160}}&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press, Khan 2012"/&gt;

==Later life==

In 1981, Major-General Nawb was again posted by the [[Ministry of Defence (Pakistan)|Ministry of Defence]] as the military liaison officer at the [[High Commission of Pakistan, London|High Commission of Pakistan]] in the [[United Kingdom]], working closely with maintaining Pakistan Army's military relations with [[British Army]].{{rp|23}}&lt;ref&gt;A Year Book of the Commonwealth. H.M. Stationery Office. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; His assignment did not last long, and eventually decided to seek [[Honorable discharge|retirement]] from his [[military service]] with the Army in 1983.&lt;ref name="Finance &amp; Development"/&gt;

After his retirement, Nawab found{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=Should this be "founded"}} the small [[Engineering consultant|engineering consulting firm]], the Experts Advisory Cell (EAC), where he worked for the [[Government of Pakistan]] as a [[Consulting engineer|consultant engineer]] to advise and monitor state owned enterprises.&lt;ref name="Finance &amp; Development"/&gt;  Later, he became involved in consulting on the [[Energy consumption|electricity manufacturing]] and [[electric power production]] to the [[Ministry of Industries and Production (Pakistan)|Ministry of Industries and Production]].&lt;ref name="Finance &amp; Development"/&gt;  He also co-authored a paper while consulting on the industrial [[nuclear power generation]] to the [[Ministry of Finance (Pakistan)|Ministry of Finance]] as he opined: "Evaluating Public Manufacturing Enterprises: An experimental monitoring system".&lt;ref name="Finance &amp; Development"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hartman|first1=Arntraud|first2=Syed Ali|last2=Nawab|title=Evaluating Public Manufacturing Enterprises in Pakistan: An experimental monitoring system|journal=Finance &amp; Development|volume=22|number=3|pages=27–30|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the contributions of Nawab's and his firm, the EAC, to industrialization of Pakistan were recognized by the World Bank and IMF in the 1983 World Development Report.&lt;ref&gt;"Managing State Owned Enterprises". World Development Report 1983. World Bank Publications. {{ISBN|0195204328}}, 9780195204322. 1983: 82. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

He later consulted the [[Ministry of Defence Production (Pakistan)|Ministry of Defence Production]] on product safety and quality assurance for many years, until living a quiet live in [[Karachi]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Adrian and Catherine Scott-Clark, Deception: Pakistan, the United States, and the Secret Trade in Nuclear Weapons. New York. Walker Publishing Company. 1977: page 112. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February 1994, Nawab passed away at his estate in [[Karachi]], and was buried in [[List of cemeteries in Karachi|Military Cemetery]] in [[Defence Housing Authority, Karachi|DHA Society]] in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan.{{rp|220}}&lt;ref name="Springer, 2001 A. Siddiqa" /&gt; For many years, Nawab's work and role at the [[Kahuta Research Laboratories|KRL]] was not known to the public and details of his work was kept well hidden until the memoirs were published by dr. [[Abdul Qadeer Khan|AQ Khan]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="The News International (Part - VIII)" /&gt;

According to the various admission, Nawab often used the codename: ''Anis Nawab'', to hide his identity while working on classified works at the ERL, when he reportedly met with journalist Peter Griffin to discuss the issue of [[Industry of Pakistan|industrialization]] in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Adrian and Catherine Scott-Clark, Deception: Pakistan, the United States, and the Secret Trade in Nuclear Weapons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2981">'''The Hopewell Project''' is a solar-powered residence in [[North America]] that generates [[hydrogen]] for subsequent reconversion into [[electricity]], meeting all of the home's power needs, including heating and cooling, through renewable solar energy.  The  solar/hydrogen-powered home is located northwest of [[Hopewell, New Jersey]] in [[East Amwell Township, New Jersey|East Amwell Township]], cost $500,000 and was dedicated on October 20, 2006.&lt;ref name=HydrogenHouseAbout&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hydrogenhouseproject.org/contact.html |title=Hydrogen House Project: Contact |year=2013 |website=Hydrogen House Project |accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project overview ==

The Hopewell Project is an organization of private citizens advocating the adoption of renewable energy technologies.  The Hopewell Project does not advocate a particular renewable energy technology.

The Solar-Hydrogen Residence that has been set up and is operating in Hopewell, New Jersey combines [[photovoltaic]] solar, electrolyzer, fuel cell, computer software, and other technologies that have been carefully selected to work in concert to make the renewable energy installation 100% reliant on renewable energy sources for the home's energy needs, negating the need for utility delivered non-renewable energy sources.

The New Jersey project, which opened in October 2006 after four years of planning and building, cost around $500,000, some $225,000 of which was provided by the [[New Jersey Board of Public Utilities]]. The project also got equipment and expertise from a number of commercial sponsors including Exide, which donated some $50,000 worth of batteries, and [[Swagelok]], an Ohio company that provided [[stainless steel]] piping costing around $28,000. Michael Strizki, the project promoter, contributed about $100,000 of his own money.

In the summer, the solar panels generate 60% more electricity than the super-insulated house needs. The excess is stored in the form of hydrogen which is used in the winter—when the solar panels can't meet all the domestic demand—to make electricity in the fuel cell.

== Future developments ==

The Hopewell Project is currently developing a complete solar-hydrogen-fuel cell turnkey system that could be installed on an  average home. The target is to bring the system to market by 2008, for the approximate price of a mid-range automobile (considerably lower than the price for the initial system).

'''''The Phenomenon of Man''''' (''Le phénomène humain'') is a 1955 book written by the [[French people|French]] [[philosopher]], [[paleontologist]] and [[Jesuit]] priest [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. In this work, Teilhard describes [[evolution]] as a process that leads to increasing complexity, culminating in the unification of [[consciousness]].

The book was finished in the 1930s, but was published [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously]] in 1955, and translated into English in 1959. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] initially prohibited the publication of some of Teilhard's writings on the grounds that they contradicted [[orthodoxy]].

The foreword to the book was written by one of the key advocates for [[natural selection]] and evolution of the 20th century, and a co-developer of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in biology, [[Julian Huxley]].

== Summary ==
Teilhard views [[evolution]] as a process that leads to increasing complexity. From the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] to the thinking animal, a process of psychical concentration leads to greater [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' marks the beginning of a new age, as the power acquired by consciousness to turn in upon itself raises mankind to a new sphere.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Borrowing Huxley’s expression, Teilhard describes humankind as evolution becoming conscious of itself.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In Teilhard's conception of the evolution of the species, a collective identity begins to develop as trade and the transmission of ideas increases.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;  Knowledge accumulates and is transmitted in increasing levels of depth and complexity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a further augmentation of consciousness and the emergence of a thinking layer that envelops the earth.&lt;ref name="Man, Harper Torchbooks 1961, p. 244"&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Teilhard calls the new membrane the “[[noosphere]]” (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] “''nous''”, meaning mind), a term first coined by [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]. The noosphere is the [[collective consciousness]] of humanity, the networks of thought and emotion in which all are immersed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
The development of [[science]] and [[technology]] causes an expansion of the human sphere of influence, allowing a person to be simultaneously present in every corner of the world. Teilhard argues that humanity has thus become cosmopolitan, stretching a single organized membrane over the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Teilhard describes the process by which this happens as a "gigantic psychobiological operation, a sort of mega-synthesis, the “super-arrangement” to which all the thinking elements of the earth find themselves today individually and collectively subject".&lt;ref name="Man, Harper Torchbooks 1961, p. 244"/&gt; The rapid expansion of the noosphere requires a new domain of psychical expansion, which "is staring us in the face if we would only raise our heads to look at it".&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Teilhard’s view, evolution will culminate in the [[Omega Point]], a sort of supreme consciousness. Layers of consciousness will converge in Omega, fusing and consuming them in itself.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; The concentration of a conscious universe will reassemble in itself all consciousnesses as well as all that we are conscious of.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Teilhard emphasizes that each individual facet of consciousness will remain conscious of itself at the end of the process.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
{{expand section|date=July 2010}}
In 1961, the Nobel Prize-winner [[Peter Medawar]], a British immunologist, wrote a scornful review of the book for the journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= P.B. Medawar|year= 1961 |title= Critical Notice |journal= [[Mind (journal)|Mind]]| publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |volume=LXX |issue= |pages=99–106 |url= http://bactra.org/Medawar/phenomenon-of-man.html |doi= 10.1093/mind/LXX.277.99 |pmid= |pmc= |authorlink= Peter Medawar }}&lt;/ref&gt; calling it "a bag of tricks" and saying that the author had shown "an active willingness to be deceived": "the greater part of it, I shall show, is nonsense, tricked out with a variety of metaphysical conceits, and its author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself".

The evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] called Medawar's review "devastating", and ''The Phenomenon of Man'' "the quintessence of bad poetic science".&lt;ref name="Dawkins2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Dawkins|title=Unweaving the Rainbow: Science, Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZudTchiioUoC&amp;pg=PA320|date=5 April 2000|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-547-34735-9|pages=320–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the June 1995 issue of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', Jennifer Cobb Kreisberg said, "Teilhard saw the Net coming more than half a century before it arrived":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=A Globe, Clothing Itself With a Brain | publisher= [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date=June 1995 | url= https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/teilhard_pr.html | author=Jennifer Cobb Kreisberg | accessdate=2010-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Teilhard imagined a stage of evolution characterized by a complex membrane of information enveloping the globe and fueled by human consciousness. It sounds a little off-the-wall, until you think about the Net, that vast electronic web encircling the Earth, running point to point through a nerve-like constellation of wires.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In July 2009, during a [[vespers]] service in [[Aosta Cathedral]] in northern Italy, [[Pope Benedict XVI]], reflecting on the [[Epistle to the Romans]] in which "St. Paul writes that the world itself will one day become a form of living worship", commented on Teilhard:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ncronline.org/print/14207 | title=Pope cites Teilhardian vision of the cosmos as a 'living host' | date=28 July 2009| author=John L. Allen Jr. | publisher= |work=[[National Catholic Reporter]]| accessdate=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It's the great vision that later Teilhard de Chardin also had: At the end we will have a true cosmic liturgy, where the cosmos becomes a living host. Let's pray to the Lord that he help us be priests in this sense, to help in the transformation of the world in adoration of God, beginning with ourselves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3815">The '''[[United States Air Force]] Stability and Control DATCOM''' is a collection, correlation, codification, and recording of best knowledge, opinion, and judgment in the area of aerodynamic stability and control prediction methods. It presents substantiated techniques for use (1) early in the design or concept study phase, (2) to evaluate changes resulting from proposed engineering fixes, and (3) as a training on crosstraining aid. It bridges the gap between theory and practice by including a combination of pertinent discussion and proven practical methods. For any given configuration and flight condition, a complete set of stability and control derivatives can be determined without resort to outside information.

A spectrum of methods is presented, ranging from very simple and easily applied techniques to quite accurate and thorough procedures. Comparatively simple methods are presented in complete form, while the more complex methods are often handled by reference to separate treatments. Tables which compare calculated results with test data provide indications of method accuracy. Extensive references to related material are also included.

The report was compiled from September 1975 to September 1977 by the [[McDonnell Douglas Corporation]] in conjunction with the engineers at the Flight Dynamics Laboratory at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]].

== Methodology ==
Fundamentally, the purpose of the DATCOM (Data Compendium), is to provide a systematic summary of methods for estimating basic stability and control derivatives. The DATCOM is organized in such a way that it is self-sufficient. For any given flight condition and configuration the complete set of derivatives can be determined without resort to outside information. The book is intended to be used for preliminary design purposes before the acquisition of test data. The use of reliable test data in lieu of the DATCOM is always recommended. However, there are many cases where the DATCOM can be used to advantage in conjunction with test data.

For instance, if the lift-curve slope of a wing-body combination is desired, the DATCOM recommends that the lift-curve slopes of the isolated wing and body, respectively, be estimated by methods presented and that appropriate wing-body interference factors (also presented) be applied. If wing-alone test data are available, it is obvious that these test data should be substituted in place of the estimated wing-alone characteristics in determining the lift-curve slope of the combination. Also, if test data are available on a configuration similar to a given configuration, the characteristics of the similar configuration can be corrected to those for the given configuration by judiciously using the DATCOM material.

== Sections  ==
The DATCOM Manual is divided into 9 sections:

* Guide to DATCOM and Methods Summary
* General Information
* Effects of External Stores
* Characteristics at Angle of Attack
* Characteristics in Sideslip
* Characteristics of High-Lift and Control Devices
* Dynamic Derivatives
* Mass and Inertia
* Characteristics of VTOL-STOL Aircraft

== Implementation  ==
Many textbooks utilized in universities implement the DATCOM method of stability and control. Shortly before compilation of the DATCOM was completed, a computerized version called Digital DATCOM was created. The [[United States Air Force Stability and Control Digital DATCOM|USAF S&amp;C Digital DATCOM]] implements the DATCOM methods in an easy to use manner.

[[Image:Unit block wagon.jpg|thumb|Wooden unit blocks in a wagon]]
A '''unit block''' is a type of standardized wooden [[toy block]] for children. Known also as '''standard unit blocks''' or '''kindergarten blocks''', these building blocks are common in [[preschool]]s and some [[kindergarten]] classrooms in the United States.

==Sizes==
A unit block is 5.5&amp;nbsp;inches long, 2.75&amp;nbsp;inches wide, and 1.375&amp;nbsp;inches thick. Larger pieces include the double (11&amp;nbsp;inches long) and quadruple (22&amp;nbsp;inches long) sizes. Smaller sizes are made in various [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] of the standard unit.

==History==
[[File:Child playing with unit blocks 2.jpeg|thumbnail|Child playing with unit blocks]]The unit block principle was popularized by educator [[Caroline Pratt (educator)|Caroline Pratt]] in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.communityplaythings.com/about-us/history|title=communityplaythings.com - Our History|website=www.communityplaythings.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt based her blocks on a similar but larger-scale block system designed by educator [[Patty Hill]], a follower of [[Friedrich Fröbel]], the originator of kindergarten education. Fröbel's series of 20 age-calibrated educational "gifts" had included a set of eight blocks, sized ½ by 1 by 2 inches, or a 1:2:4 ratio, which could be formed into a cube.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite web|last1=G.F.|title=The Economist explains How do unit blocks help children learn?|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/07/economist-explains-6|website=The Economist|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She founded the [[City and Country School]] in 1914 in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080528093432/http://www.cityandcountry.org/cc2/mission.html City and Country School Mission/Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, under license from the school, a version of the blocks was sold by a company called [[Childcraft (toy manufacturer)|Childcraft]].

==Wood==
Unit blocks vary in price according to the wood used and the manufacturer. [[Maple]] blocks (the original wood put forth by Pratt) are more expensive than [[birch]] or [[beech]], which in turn are more expensive than [[rubberwood]].

'''United States foreign policy in the Middle East''' has its roots as early as the Barbary Wars in the first years of the U.S.'s existence, but became much more expansive after [[World War II]]. American policy during the [[Cold   War]] tried to prevent [[Soviet Union]] influence by supporting anti-communist regimes and backing [[Israel]] against Soviet-sponsored [[Arab]] countries. The U.S. also came to replace the [[United Kingdom]] as the main security patron of the [[Persian Gulf]] states in the 1960s and 1970s, working to ensure a stable flow of Gulf [[oil]].&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=81402&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[9/11 attacks]] of 2001, U.S. policy has included an emphasis on [[counter-terrorism]]. The U.S. has diplomatic relations with all countries in the [[Middle East]] except for [[Iran]], whose 1979 [[Iranian Revolution|revolution]] brought to power a staunchly anti-American regime.

Recent priorities of the U.S. government in the Middle East have included resolving the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and limiting the spread of [[weapons of mass destruction]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/04/america-trump-kennedy-syria-atomic-war/523092/&lt;/ref&gt; among regional states.

== History==
[[File:Decatur Boarding the Tripolitan Gunboat.jpg|thumb|U.S. naval officer [[Stephen Decatur]] boarding a Tripolitan gunboat during the [[First Barbary War]], 1804]]
The United States' relationship with the Middle East prior to [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] was limited, although commercial ties existed even in the early 19th century. President [[Andrew Jackson]] established formal ties with the Sultan of [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] and [[Oman]] in 1833. (The Sultan saw the U.S. as a potential balance to Britain's overwhelming regional influence.) Commercial relations opened between the U.S. and Persia in 1857, after Britain persuaded the Persian government not to ratify a similar agreement in 1851.&lt;ref name="Fain2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fain|first=W.

In comparison to European powers such as Britain and France which had managed to colonize almost all of the Middle East region after defeating the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1918, the United States was "popular and respected throughout the Middle East".&lt;ref&gt;Fawcett, L., (2005) ''The International Relations of the Middle East'', UK: Oxford University Press, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, "Americans were seen as good people, untainted by the selfishness and duplicity associated with the Europeans."&lt;ref name="Fawcett, L 2005 p 285"&gt;Fawcett, L. (2005) ''The International Relations of the Middle East'' UK: Oxford University Press p 285&lt;/ref&gt; American missionaries had brought modern medicine and set up educational institutions all over the Middle East. Moreover, the United States had provided the Middle East with highly skilled petroleum engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Rugh, W. A. (2005) ''American Encounters with Arabs: The Soft Power of U.S. Public Diplomacy in the Middle East'' U.S.: Praeger Publishers Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-275-98817-3}} pp 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there were some connections made between the United States and the Middle East before the Second World War. Other examples of cooperations between the U.S. and the Middle East are the [[Red Line Agreement]] signed in 1928 and the [[Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement]] signed in 1944. Both of these agreements were legally binding and reflected an American interest in control of Middle Eastern energy resources, namely oil, and moreover reflected an American "security imperative to prevent the (re)emergence of a powerful regional rival".&lt;ref&gt;Le Billon, P., El Khatib, F. (March 2004) "From free oil to 'freedom oil': terrorism, war and U.S. Geopolitics in the Persian Gulf", ''Geopolitics'', Volume 9, Issue 1 p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Line Agreement had been "part of a network of agreements made in the 1920s to restrict supply of petroleum and ensure that the major [mostly American] companies … could control oil prices on world markets".&lt;ref&gt;Review (Winter 1982): "State Power and Industry Influence: American Foreign Oil Policy in the 1940s", ''International Organization'' 36, no. 1 p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Line agreement governed the development of Middle East oil for the next two decades. The Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement of 1944 was based on negotiations between the United States and Britain over the control of Middle Eastern oil. Below is shown what the American President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had in mind for to a British Ambassador in 1944:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Persian oil … is yours. We share the oil of Iraq and Kuwait. As for Saudi Arabian oil, it's ours.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin, D (1991) ''The Prize: The Epic quest for Oil, Money and Power'' New York: Simon and Schuster p 401&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On August 8, 1944, the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement was signed, dividing Middle Eastern oil between the United States and Britain. Consequently, political scholar Fred H. Lawson remarks, that by the mid-1944, U.S. officials had buttressed their country's position on the peninsula by concluding an Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement that protected "all valid concession contracts and lawfully acquired rights" belonging to the signatories and established a principle of "equal opportunity" in those areas where no concession had yet been assigned.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, F. H. (Aug., 1989) "The Iranian Crisis of 1945–1946 and the Spiral Model of International Conflict" ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', Vol. 21, No. 3 p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, political scholar Irvine Anderson summarises American interests in the Middle East in the late 19th century and the early 20th century noting that, "the most significant event of the period was the transition of the United States from the position of net exporter to one of net importer of petroleum."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Irvine.(1981) ''Aramco, The United States, and Saudi Arabia''. Princeton University Press. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the Second World War, the United States had come to consider the Middle East region as "the most strategically important area of the world."&lt;ref name="Chomsky, N 2005 p 8"&gt;[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky, Noam]] (January/February 2005) "Imperial Presidency", ''Canadian Dimension'', Vol. 39, No. 1 p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and "one of the greatest material prizes in world history," argues [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref name="Chomsky, N 2005 p 8" /&gt; For that reason, it was not until around the period of World War&amp;nbsp;II that America became directly involved in the [[Middle East]] region. At this time the region was going through great social, economic and political changes and as a result, internally the Middle East was in turmoil. Politically, the Middle East was experiencing an upsurge in the popularity of nationalistic politics and an increase in the number of nationalistic political groups across the region, which was causing great trouble for the English and French colonial powers.

History scholar Jack Watson explains that "Europeans could not hold these lands indefinitely in the face of [[Arab nationalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Watson, J. B. (1981) Success ''in Twentieth century World Affairs since 1919'' Norwich: John Murray (Publishers) Ltd p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Watson then continues, stating that "by the end of 1946 Palestine was the last remaining mandate, but it posed a major problem".&lt;ref&gt;Watson, J. B. (1981), ''Success in Twentieth Century World Affairs since 1919'', Norwich: John Murray (Publishers) Ltd p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; In truth, this nationalistic political trend clashed with American interests in the Middle East, which were, as Middle East scholar Louise Fawcett argues, "about the [[Soviet Union]], access to oil and the project for a Jewish state in [[Mandate Palestine|Palestine]]".&lt;ref&gt;Fawcett, L. (2005), ''International Relations of the Middle East'' UK: Oxford University Press, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Arabist Ambassador [[Raymond Hare]] described the Second World War, as "the great divide" in United States' relation with the Middle East, because these three interests would later serve as a backdrop and reasoning for a great deal of American interventions in the Middle East and thus also come to be the cause of several future conflicts between the United States and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Fawcett, L 2005 p 285" /&gt;

== Formation of Israel ==
{{Main|United States–Israel relations}}
In 1947, the U.S. and the Truman administration, under domestic political pressure, pushed for a solution and resolution on the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], and in May 1948 the new state of Israel came into existence. This process was not without its fights and loss of lives. Nevertheless, "the first state to extend diplomatic recognition to Israel was the United States; the Soviet Union and several Western nations quickly followed suit. No Arab state, however, recognized Israel."&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, W, C, Piotrowski, H, (6th ed.)(2005) ''The World since 1945: A History of International Relations U.S.'' Lynne Rienner Publishers p 154&lt;/ref&gt;

== Syria: 1949 ==
[[Syria]] became an independent republic in 1946, but the [[March 1949 Syrian coup d'état]], led by Army Chief of Staff [[Husni al-Za'im]], ended the initial period of civilian rule. Za'im met at least six times with CIA operatives in the months prior to the coup to discuss his plan to seize power. Za'im requested American funding or personnel, but it is not known whether this assistance was provided. Once in power, Za'im made several key decisions that benefitted the United States. He approved the [[Trans-Arabian Pipeline]] (TAPLINE), an American project designed to transport Saudi Arabian oil to Mediterranean ports. Construction of TAPLINE had been delayed due to Syrian intransigence. Za'im also improved relations with two American allies in the region: Israel and Turkey. He signed an [[1949 Armistice Agreements|armistice]] with Israel, formally ending the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] and he renounced Syrian claims to [[Hatay Province]], a major source of dispute between Syria and Turkey. Za'im also cracked down on local communists. However, Za'im's regime was short-lived. He was overthrown in August, just four and a half months after seizing power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Douglas Little|year=1990|title=Cold War and Covert Action: The United States and Syria, 1945–1958|journal=Middle East Journal|volume=44|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/issue51/articles/51_12-13.pdf|title=1949–1958, Syria: Early Experiments in Cover Action, Douglas Little, Professor, Department of History, Clark University|format=PDF|accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gendzier|first=Irene L.|title=Notes from the Minefield: United States Intervention in Lebanon and the Middle East, 1945–1958|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1997|page=98|quote=Recent investigation … indicates that CIA agents Miles Copeland and Stephen Meade … were directly involved in the coup in which Syrian colonel Husni Za'im seizedpower.

== Mosaddeq and the Shah ==
{{seealso|1953 Iranian coup d'état}}
[[File:Supportes of Mosaddegh.JPG|thumb|Supporters of Mohammed Mosaddeq in 1952]]
Opposed to foreign intervention in Iran and a keen nationalist, [[Mohammed Mosaddeq]] became the prime minister of Iran in 1951. Thus, when Mosaddeq was elected he chose to nationalize the Iranian oil industry, where previously British holdings had generated great profits for Britain through the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]]. Furthermore, prior to the nationalisation of Iranian oil Mosaddeq had also cut all diplomatic ties with Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Dionisi, D, J(2005) ''American Hiroshima: The reasons why and a call to strengthen America's Democracy'', Canada: Trafford Publishing, {{ISBN|1-4120-4421-9}}, pp 30–38&lt;/ref&gt; The Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was opposed to the nationalisation of Iranian oil as he feared this would result in an oil embargo, which would destroy Iran's economy and thus, the Shah was very concerned with the effect of Mosaddeq's policies on Iran. Equally worried were workers in the Iranian oil industry, when they experienced the economic effect of the sanctions on Iranian oil exports which Mosaddeq's policies had resulted in, and riots were happening across Iran.&lt;ref name="Immerman, R 2006 p 314"&gt;[[Richard H. Immerman|Immerman, R. H.]], [[Athan Theoharis|Theoharis, A. G.]] (2006) ''The Central Intelligence Agency: Security under Scrutiny'' U.S.: Greenwood Press, {{ISBN|0-313-33282-7}}, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi asked Mosaddeq to resign, as was the Shah's constitutional right, but Mosaddeq refused, which resulted in national uprisings. The Shah, fearing for his personal security, fled the country but nominated [[General Fazlollah Zahedi]] as new Prime Minister. Although General Fazlollah Zahedi was a nationalist, he did not agree with the Mosaddeq's lenient attitude towards the communist [[Tudeh]] party, which the United States had also become increasingly concerned with, fearing Soviet influence spreading in the Middle East. Therefore, in late 1952, the British government asked the U.S. administration for help with the removal of Mohammed Mosaddeq. President [[Harry S. Truman]] thought Mossadeq was a valuable bulwark against Soviet influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB126/|title=Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran|publisher=[[National Security Archive]]|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Truman left office in January 1953, and the new administration of [[Dwight Eisenhower]] shared British concern over Mossadeq. Allen Dulles, the director of the CIA, approved one million dollars on April 4, 1953 to be used "in any way that would bring about the fall of Mossadegh"&lt;ref name="Dionisi, D 2005 p 40"&gt;Dionisi, D, J(2005) ''American Hiroshima: The reasons why and a call to strengthen America's Democracy'', Canada: Trafford Publishing, {{ISBN|1-4120-4421-9}}, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, after a failed attempt on August 15, "on August 19, 1953, General Fazlollah Zahedi succeeded [with the help of the United States and Britain] and Mossadegh was overthrown. The CIA covertly funneled five million dollars to General Zahedi's regime on August 21, 1953."&lt;ref name="Dionisi, D 2005 p 40" /&gt;

This CIA operation, often referred to as [[Operation Ajax]] and led by CIA officer [[Kermit Roosevelt, Jr.]], ensured the return of the Shah on August 22, 1953.&lt;ref name="Immerman, R 2006 p 314" /&gt;

== The Suez Crisis ==
{{Main|Suez Crisis}}
[[File:1956-08-09 Press Parley.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:43|President Eisenhower press conference about the crisis, 9 August 1956]]
Today more than a quarter of the world's oil is shipped through the Suez Canal.&lt;ref&gt;Fiscus, J, W (2004) ''War and Conflict in the Middle East: The Suez Crisis'', U.S.: The Rosen Publishers Group, {{ISBN|0-8239-4550-2}}, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Although accepting large sums of military aid from the United States in 1954, by 1956 Egyptian leader [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] had grown tired of the American influence in the country. The involvement that the U.S. would take in Egyptian business and politics in return for aid, Nasser thought "smacked of [[colonialism]]."&lt;ref&gt;Lesch, D, W(ed.) (2003) ''The Middle East and the United States: A Historical and Political Reassesment'' U.S.: Westview Press, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, as political scholar B.M. Bleckman argued in 1978, "Nasser had ambivalent feelings toward the United States. From 1952 to 1954 he was on close terms with U.S. officials and was viewed in Washington as a promising moderate Arab leader. The conclusion of an arms deal with the USSR in 1955, however, had cooled the relationship between Cairo and Washington considerably, and the Dulles-Eisenhower decision to withdraw the offer to finance the [[Aswan High Dam]] in mid-1956 was a further blow to the chances of maintaining friendly ties. Eisenhower's stand against the British, French, and Israeli attack on Egypt in October 1956 created a momentary sense of gratitude on the part of Nasser, but the subsequent development of the Eisenhower Doctrine, so clearly aimed at 'containing' Nasserism, undermined what little goodwill existed toward the United States in Cairo."&lt;ref&gt;Bleckman B, M, Kaplan, S, S (1978) ''Force Without War: U.S. armed Forces As a Political Instrument'' U.S.: The Brookings Institution p 249&lt;/ref&gt; "The Suez Crisis of 1956 marked the demise of British power and its gradual replacement by USA as the dominant power in the Middle East."&lt;ref&gt;Attie, C. C. (2004) ''Struggle in the Levant'', Kings Lynn: The Centre for Lebanese Studies, Oxford p 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Eisenhower Doctrine became a manifestation of this process. "The general objective of the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]], like that of the Truman Doctrine formulated ten years earlier, was the containment of Soviet expansion."&lt;ref&gt;Attie, ''Struggle in the Levant'', p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when the Doctrine was finalised on March 9, 1957, it "essentially gave the president the latitude to intervene militarily in the Middle East … without having to resort to Congress."&lt;ref&gt;Attie, ''Struggle in the Levant'', p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; indeed as, Middle East scholar Irene L. Gerdzier explains "that with the Eisenhower Doctrine the United States emerged "as the uncontested Western power … in the Middle East."&lt;ref&gt;Gettleman, M, E, Schaar, S (2003) ''The Middle East and Islamic World Reader'', U.S.: Grove Press p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in [[Jordan]] nationalistic anti-government rioting broke out and the United States decided to send a battalion of marines to [[Lebanon]] in case of possibly having to intervene in Jordan later that year. Moreover, attempting to keep the pro-American King Hussein of Jordan in power, the CIA started to make secret payments of millions of dollars a year to King Hussein. In the same year, the U.S. supported allies in Lebanon, Iraq, Turkey and Saudi Arabia and sent fleets to be near Syria as Syria's government had executed nationalistic and pro-Soviet policies the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, S, E (1980) ''The Rise to Globalism: American Foreign Policy, 1938–1980'' New York: Penguin Books p. 463&lt;/ref&gt; However, 1958 was to become a difficult year in U.S. foreign policy; in 1958 Syria and Egypt were merged into the "United Arab Republic", anti-American and anti-government revolts started occurring in Lebanon, causing the Lebanese president Chamoun to ask America for help, and the very pro-American King Feisal the 2nd of Iraq was overthrown by a group of nationalistic military officers.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhower, (1965) ''White House Years, vol. 2: Waaina Peace 1956–1961'' New York: Doubleday, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; It was quite "commonly believed that [Nasser] … stirred up the unrest in Lebanon and, perhaps, had helped to plan the Iraqi revolution."&lt;ref&gt;Owen, R, Louis, R(2002) ''A Revolutionary year: The Middle East in 1958'', U.K.: I.B. Tauris &amp; Co,. Ltd, {{ISBN|1-86064-402-3}}, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Six Day War and Black September ==
{{details|topic=Black September|Black September in Jordan}}
In June 1967 Israel fought with Egypt, Jordan, and Syria in the [[Six-Day War]]. As a result of the war, Israel captured the [[West Bank]], [[Golan Heights]], and the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. The U.S. supported Israel with weapons and continued to support Israel financially throughout the 1970s. On September 17, 1970, with U.S. and Israeli help, Jordanian troops attacked [[PLO]] guerrilla camps, while Jordan's U.S.-supplied air force dropped napalm from above. The U.S. deployed the aircraft carrier ''Independence'' and six destroyers off the coast of Lebanon and readied troops in Turkey to support the assault.

The American interventions in the years before the Iranian revolution have all proven to be based in part on economic considerations, but more so have been influenced and led by the international Cold War context.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, J. B. (1981) Success ''in Twentieth century World Affairs since 1919'' Norwich: John Murray (Publishers) Ltd p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;

The relations of the U.S. with [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] have been closely tied to the [[War on terrorism]] that has happened there. American policy has been instrumental in coordinating the ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan.

The Turkish government accused the coup leaders of being linked to the [[Gülen movement]], which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by [[Fethullah Gülen]], a Turkish businessman and cleric who lives in Pennsylvania, United States.

'''XMASS''' is a multipurpose [[physics]] experiment in [[Japan]] that monitors a large tank of [[xenon]] for flashes of light that might be caused by hypothetical [[dark matter]] particles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/xmass/about/index-e.html XMASS overview]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to searching for dark matter, XMASS is also studying neutrinoless double beta decay and solar neutrinos.

Its results have not confirmed the annual variation seen in some earlier experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/september-2015/xmass-continues-dark-matter-debate XMASS continues dark matter debate. Oct 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Construction started in April 2007. The detector was completed in September 2010. Commissioning run was conducted between October 2010 and June 2012. Since November 2013, the detector has been taking scientific data. The detector is sometimes called XMASS-I, as it is planned to be superseded by an upgrade called XMASS-1.5 (a 5 ton detector) and eventually XMASS-II (24 ton detector).

As of 2018, the experiment continues.

==Detector==
The detector is located 1000m underground in the [[Kamioka Observatory]] in Japan. It contains about 800&amp;nbsp;kg of liquid xenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/xmass/about/status/index-e.html About XMASS : Detector]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Çanta Wind Farm''' ({{lang-tr|Çanta Rüzgar Enerji Santrali}}) is a [[wind power]] plant consisting of 19 [[wind turbine]]s with a total installed capacity of 47.5&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Megawatt|MW]]. The wind farm is situated in [[Çanta, Silivri|Çanta]] town of [[Silivri]] district in [[Istanbul Province]], northwestern [[Turkey]]. It went in production by end May 2014.

The wind farm was initially projected by Bora Wind Energy Company in 2011. After Boydak Energy Company took over Bora Co., the construction began in 2012. The farm went in production by end May 2014 with six turbines of each 2.5&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Megawatt|MW]]. By end June the same year, eight more turbines increased the total installed capacity to 35&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt;

==Location==
The wind farm is located on a {{convert|240|m|ft|abbr=on}}-high hill northwest of Çanta town,&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt; just east of the provincial border between [[Tekirdağ Province|Tekirdağ]] and Istanbul. It is at a distance of {{convert|27|km|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Çorlu]],&lt;ref name="iwr"/&gt; {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on}} to Silivri and {{convert|83|km|mi|abbr=on}} to Istanbul.

==Technical details==
Maximum power output of each of the 19 turbines supplied by [[Nordex SE|Nordex]] in Germany is 2.5&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Megawatt|MW]],&lt;ref name="ye"/&gt; and the total annual energy production is about 151&amp;nbsp;[[Kilowatt hour|GWh]].&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt; The turbines of type [[Nordex SE#Technical data 2.5&amp;nbsp;MW Gamma class|N100/2500]] have {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} rotor diameter.&lt;ref name="iwr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mm"/&gt;

Average annual wind speed at the site is given with {{convert|7.5|-|8.5|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="iwr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ye"/&gt;
