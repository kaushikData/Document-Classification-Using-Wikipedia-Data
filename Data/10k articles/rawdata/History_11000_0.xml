The '''seventh millennium''' of the [[Gregorian calendar]] will begin on January 1, 6001, and end on December 31, 7000. 

==Astronomical events==
These are astronomical dates, so they are given in the astronomical format of Year Month Day, which allows them to be ordered.
*6212 November 7: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] [[occultation|occults]] [[Regulus]].
*6587 September 9: [[Venus]] occults Regulus.
*6727 August 25: [[Mars]] occults Regulus for the first time since June 28, 17,619 [[Anno Domini|BC]]. Despite the over 24,300 years wait, it will happen three more times over the next 677 years.
*6757 July 5: There is anticipated to be a simultaneous [[solar eclipse]] and [[transit of Mercury]], the first such simultaneous [[eclipse]] and planetary transit in over 13 millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transit.savage-garden.org/en/sedt/24/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222115137/http://transit.savage-garden.org/en/sedt/24/|title=AD 6757 Jul 05 - Simultaneous occurrence of solar eclipse and transit of Mercury|author=Zhelyazko Zhelyazkov|archivedate=22 February 2012|work=savage-garden.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*6947 October 9: Mercury occults Regulus.

==Other==
*In the year 6939, the [[Westinghouse Time Capsules]] from the years 1939 and 1964 are scheduled to be opened after 5,000 years.
*In the year 6970, the Expo'70 Time Capsule from the year 1970, buried under a monument near [[Osaka Castle]], Japan, is scheduled to be opened after 5,000 years.
*The [[Astrological age|Age of Capricorn]] will end its 2000-year reign.
*By 7000 AD, [[Venus]] could feasibly have been [[terraforming|terraformed]], according to [[Martyn J. Fogg]] in ''Terraforming: Engineering Planetary Environments''.

==Science fiction==
* The events of the video game series ''[[Xenosaga]]'' take place sometime in the early 6000s. Due to the vagueness of the times given in Episode 1 of the series ('20xx' followed by '4000 years in the future'), it is possible the events cross over into the 62nd century. Contrary to this, the dates given in ''[[Xenogears Perfect Works]]'' would place Xenosaga's events in the year 7277. The Xenogears timeline does not apply to the Xenosaga timeline. At one time the two story arcs were believed to exist in the same fictional universe as many of those involved with the design and development of Xenogears continued to work on Xenosaga. However it has been stated on several occasions that the two universes are not directly related in any way.
* In ''[[Doctor Who]]'', [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor's]] daughter [[Jenny (Doctor Who)|Jenny]] was born on July 24, 6012 in the 61st century on the planet Messaline, which humans had colonised along with the amphibious Hath. By this time cloning technology that can duplicate an adult human within seconds and implant knowledge into their mind has been perfected.

• The 2018 Doctor Who episode “The Tsuranga Conundrum” is set in the 67th century. 

*The first [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] [[Jay Garrick]] met a foe Dmane from the year 6946, who was accidentally sent back to 1946 when he was about to be executed for rebelling against the Government. He is sent back to his own time and executed. The beings of his era have larger, more pointed heads.
*Flash [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues Gallery]] member [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] originally came from the 64th century, according to his first comics appearance in February 1962. He was exiled to the past by the tyrannical Central Clockworks that rule Earth.

=== Music ===
* In the song "[[In the Year 2525]]" by [[Zager and Evans]], it is predicted that by the year 6565 mating will cease to exist in its current form, and children will be chosen from a "long glass tube".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Laffer|first=William D.|title='In the Year 2525' Began in the Year 1965: The Anatomy of a No. 1 Record|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OzkoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JigEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5309,599319&amp;dq=in-the-year-2525&amp;hl=en|newspaper=The [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Journal]] |date=22 July 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The song "Here in 6048" by the Italian power metal band [[Vision Divine]], makes multiple references about life in the 7th millennium.
* In the song "[[6969]]" by [[Ninja Sex Party]], the comedy duo travels to the titular year hoping to find a sexual paradise, but instead discover a [[dystopia]]n world where human touch has been outlawed by the tyrannical Council of Dick Elders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Garza |first=Richard |date=27 July 2015 |title=Attitude City by Ninja Sex Party a funny, sexual album |url=http://www.westernherald.com/arts_and_entertainment/article_facdf4a6-3237-11e5-b07a-8b39ddb59201.html |publisher=Western Herald |access-date=27 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1802">The '''Agri''' were an ancient people dwelling along the [[Palus Maeotis]] in antiquity. [[Strabo]] describes them as living among the [[Maeotae]], [[Sindi (people)|Sindi]], [[Dandarii]], [[Toreatae]], [[Arrechi]], [[Tarpetes]], [[Sittaceni]], [[Dosci]], and [[Aspurgiani]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D11%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D11 Strab. 11.2.11 at Tufts University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Agri is one of the [[Maeotae]] tribes, who lived in the 1st millennium BC on the east and the southeast coast of the [[Azov sea]]. Russian scientists, archeologists, historians and ethnographers in the Soviet period concluded that the Maeotae is one of the tribes of the [[Adyghe people]] ([[Circassians]]).

In the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' in the article about the [[Adyghe people]]) it says&lt;ref&gt;[http://gatchina3000.ru/big/002/515_bolshaya-sovetskaya.htm ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia''. [[Sub voce|s.v.]] Adyghe]&lt;/ref&gt;"Living in the basin of the river Kuban part of the tribes ([[Adyghe people]]), as a rule, be indicated (names) of ancient historians under the collective name 'Maeotae'." In the article about the Maeotae it is written.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/~книги/БСЭ/Меоты/ ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia''. s.v. Maeotae]&lt;/ref&gt;"Maeotae were engaged in farming and fishing. Part of the Maeotae by the language was akin to the Adygs (Circassians), the part of the Iranians. In the 4th–3rd centuries BC many of Maeotae included in the composition of the [[Bosporan kingdom]]."

'''''Ancient Aliens''''' is an American television series that premiered on April 20, 2010, on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/ancient-aliens/episodes|title=Ancient Aliens Episode Guide|date=December 25, 2010|publisher=History.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by [[Prometheus Entertainment]] in a documentary style, the program presents hypotheses of [[ancient astronauts]] and proposes that historical texts, archaeology, and legends contain evidence of past human-[[Potential cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact|extraterrestrial contact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/ancient-aliens/articles/ancient-alien-theory|title=Ancient Aliens Theory|date=December 25, 2010|publisher=History.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/ancient-aliens/articles/evidence-of-ancient-aliens|title=Evidence of Ancient Aliens?|date=December 25, 2010|publisher=History.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show has been widely criticized by [[historians]], [[cosmologists]] and other scientific circles for presenting and promoting [[pseudoscience]] and [[pseudohistory]].

The series started with a [[TV special]] of the same name that aired on March 8, 2009, on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] channel. Seasons 1–3 aired on the same channel until 2011. From season 4 to the middle of season 7, the series aired on [[H2 (TV channel)|H2]]. On April 10, 2015, episode premieres returned to History.

Season 13 premiered on April 27, 2018 with a two-hour special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/ancient-aliens-season-13-when-will-show-return|title=Ancient Aliens Season 13: What date will show return in 2018?|first=Julian|last=Cheetle|publisher=Monstersandcritics.com|date=March 30, 2018|accessdate=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The executive producer of ''Ancient Aliens'' is [[Kevin Burns]], who also directed and wrote the pilot episode. [[Giorgio A. Tsoukalos]] serves as consulting producer and appeared on screen in the pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radioamerikanow.com/?p=1731|title=December 4, 2010, Giorgio Tsoukalos, "Ancient Aliens" &amp; "Twilight of the Gods"|author=Barb|format=podcast|publisher=Radio Amerika Now|date=December 4, 2010|accessdate=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erich von Däniken]] appeared in the pilot episode, and UFO researcher [[C. Scott Littleton]] served as an expert consultant for the show until his death in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1556-3502.2011.52231.x|title=Obituary of C. Scott Littleton|work=Anthropology News|date=February 17, 2011|volume=52|number=2|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio talk show host [[George Noory]] speaks in five episodes, including the pilot. Reverend [[Barry Downing]], known for describing angels in the Bible as ancient astronauts, offered his viewpoints in the pilot episode. Psychologist [[Jonathan Young (psychologist)|Jonathan Young]], who brings a mythological perspective, appears on screen in every episode but the first pilot. [[Alternate history]] author [[David Hatcher Childress]] speaks frequently in most episodes.

It presents theories as to why the Maya backdated the 5125-year long-count calendar to 3114 BC (over 3,000 years before their civilization began) and what could happen after it ends December 21, 2012. Discussed are two artifacts, [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] monument six and a [[Comalcalco]] mud brick, that may suggest the return of a star god Bolon Yokte; the [[Popol Vuh]] creation myths; the [[Chilam Balam]] manuscripts; and the monuments of [[Tikal]] (which is suggested to have been built to mimic the [[Pleiades]] cluster); and [[Chichen Itza]], dedicated to the return of the Maya god [[Kukulkan]].

===Critical reception===
Reviewers have characterized the show as "far-fetched",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph (London)|date=April 30, 2011|page=38|title=Ancient Aliens|author=SH}}&lt;/ref&gt; "hugely speculative",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Times (London)|date=April 30, 2011|first=Joe|last=Clay|title=Digital Choices|page= 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "...expound[ing] wildly on theories suggesting that astronauts wandered the Earth freely in ancient times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Globe and Mail (Canada)|date=April 25, 2011|first=Andrew|last=Ryan|title=Tonight on TV/Critical Picks|page=R2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the ideas presented in the show are not accepted by the scientific community, and have been criticized as [[pseudoscience]] and [[pseudohistory]].&lt;ref name=Fritze&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/hsp/summary/v010/10.5.fritze.html|last=Fritze|first=Ronald H.|title=On the Perils and Pleasures of Confronting Pseudohistory|work=Historically Speaking|volume=10|number=5|date=November 2009|pages=2–5|issn=1941-4188}}&lt;/ref&gt; History professor [[Ronald H. Fritze]] observed that pseudoscience as offered by von Däniken and the ''Ancient Aliens'' program has a periodic popularity in the US: "In a pop culture with a short memory and a voracious appetite, aliens and pyramids and lost civilizations are recycled like fashions."&lt;ref name=Fritze/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rorotoko&gt;{{cite web|last=Fritze|first=Ronald|title=Ronald H.

[[Forbes.com]] contributor Brad Lockwood criticized ''Ancient Aliens'' as an example of the History Channel's addition of "programs devoted to monsters, aliens, and conspiracies", commenting that, "''Ancient Aliens'' defies all ability to suspend disbelief for the sake of entertainment."&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news|last=Lockwood|first=Brad|title=High Ratings Aside, Where's the History on History?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradlockwood/2011/10/17/high-ratings-aside-wheres-the-history-on-history/|work=October 17, 2011|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes.com staff writer Alex Knapp also criticized the series and cited [[archaeologist]] Keith Fitzpatrick-Matthews' rebuke of the History Channel for "treating (''Ancient Aliens'') nonsense as though it were fact."&lt;ref name=Forbes2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2011/09/19/an-archaeologist-watches-the-history-channel-and-questions-the-part-about-the-aliens|title=An Archaeologist Watches the History Channel and Questions the Part About the Aliens|last1=Knapp|first1=Alex|date=September 19, 2011|work=Tech|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Smithsonian.com]] science writer Brian Switek was extremely critical of the series, particularly an episode that suggested "aliens exterminated dinosaurs to make way for our species." He characterized the show as "some of the most noxious sludge in television’s bottomless chum bucket." Switek wrote that the show employs the [[Gish gallop]] technique to overwhelm the viewer with many "fictions and distortions".&lt;ref name=Switek&gt;{{cite web|last=Switek|first=Brian|title=The Idiocy, Fabrications and Lies of Ancient Aliens|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/dinosaur/2012/05/the-idiocy-fabrications-and-lies-of-ancient-aliens|work=May 11, 2012|publisher=Smithsonian.com|accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have called attention to a paucity of opposing viewpoints.  [[Kenneth Feder]], Professor of Archaeology at [[Central Connecticut State University]] and author of ''Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries: Science and Pseudoscience in Archaeology'',&lt;ref&gt;Feder, K. (1990). ''Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries: Science and Pseudoscience in Archaeology''.  New York, McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages. {{ISBN|978-0078116971}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has said that he was approached by ''Ancient Aliens'' producers regarding his potential participation.  "My response was, I’d be happy to be on your show, but you should know that I think that the ancient astronaut hypothesis is execrable bullshit," he said, in an interview.  "I haven’t heard back from them, rather remarkably. So, I guess maybe they’re not interested in the other point of view."&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Alien Astronauts: Interview with Ken Feder.

===Appearances in popular culture===
''[[South Park]]'' parodied the show in an episode entitled "[[A History Channel Thanksgiving]]" (November 11, 2011, episode 15.13).  Reviewer Ramsey Isler commented, "The aim is placed squarely on ''Ancient Aliens'' specifically," and described the animation as "a perfect satire of all the ridiculousness of this series, including the black and white art with aliens photoshopped in, and interviews with people of dubious authority."&lt;ref name=IGN&gt;{{cite web|last=Isler|first=Ramsey|title=South Park: "A History Channel Thanksgiving" Review|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/121/1212124p1.html|work=IGN Television Reviews|publisher=IGN Entertainment|accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Viceland]] premiered ''[[Traveling the Stars: Action Bronson and Friends Watch ‘Ancient Aliens’]]'' (also known as ''Action Bronson Watches Ancient Aliens'') with a special on April 20, 2016 followed by a ten-episode series beginning in July. The series features rapper [[Action Bronson]], who praises ''Ancient Aliens'' as "the best thing that was ever created by man," commenting over the History series while smoking [[cannabis]] with celebrity guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.craveonline.com/music/1012299-action-bronson-ancient-aliens |title=Action Bronson’s New Show Is High-larious |last=Green |first=Patrick |date=July 21, 2016 |website=CraveOnline |access-date=September 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to producers Jordan Kinley and Hannah Gregg, the show was conceived as a way to address disgruntled viewers of H2, the network that formerly aired ''Ancient Aliens'' before being replaced by Viceland on cable carriers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/traveling-stars-action-bronson-friends-ancient-aliens-interview |title=How Action Bronson Ended Up Getting High and Watching 'Ancient Aliens' |last=Capossela |first=Francesca |date=August 3, 2016 |website=Vice |access-date=September 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Augustus Constantine Sinclair''' (c. 1834 – 27 January 1891) was the head of the Government Printing Office in Jamaica in the nineteenth century and the compiler with Laurence R. Fyfe of the annual ''Handbook of Jamaica'', first published in 1881. He is credited with the idea of the [[Jamaica International Exhibition]] of 1891 but died on its opening day.

==Early life and family==
Augustus Sinclair was born in Jamaica around 1834. He was christened at St. Catherine's, Middlesex, Jamaica, on 31 December 1834.&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XNJ8-D9X Augustus Constantine Sinclair.] FamilySearch.

Retrieved 6 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He married Catherine Ann Rosetta Graham in 1886 and they had a daughter, Amy Louise Graham Sinclair, born 1888, and a son, Cyril Augustus Graham Sinclair, born in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XNNX-V2F Augustus Constantine Sinclair.] FamilySearch. Retrieved 9 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
As head of the Government Printing Office, Sinclair was responsible for printing government publications, including the proceedings of the [[Jamaican Parliament]]. He was also the joint compiler with [[Laurence R. Fyfe]] of the Colonial Secretary's Office, of the first editions of the long-running ''[[Handbook of Jamaica]]'', from 1881.&lt;ref name=Eves&gt;Eves, C. Washington. (1886) ''[https://archive.org/stream/jamaicaatcolonia00eves#page/n11/mode/2up/ Jamaica at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, London, 1886]''. London: Spottiswoode. pp. vi-vii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gleaner/&gt;

Also with Fyfe, he wrote ''Jamaica: Outlines of its Geography and History'' for schools (1883, at least five later editions)&lt;ref name="Higman"&gt;"Historiography of Jamaica" by Howard Johnson in {{cite book|author=B.W. Higman (Ed.)|title=General history of the Caribbean: Volume VI Methodology and historiography of the Caribbean|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E12cpltazYgC&amp;pg=PA484|year=1999|publisher=UNESCO Publishing &amp; Macmillan Education|location=London|isbn=978-92-3-103360-5|page=484}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prepared a report of the Jamaican exhibits at the [[Colonial and Indian Exhibition]] of 1886 for the governors of the [[Jamaica Institute]] which was reprinted and bound into [[C. Washington Eves]]' own account of the exhibits.&lt;ref name=Eves/&gt; In 1889, Sinclair and Fyfe produced a history of Jamaica during the governorship of [[Sir Henry Wylie Norman]] (1883–89) which, typically of their historical works, concentrated on chronology and fact-based material rather than analysis.&lt;ref name="Higman"/&gt;

== Jamaica International Exhibition==
Sinclair is credited with the idea of the [[Jamaica International Exhibition]] of 1891 which he based on the 1851 [[Great Exhibition]] in London.&lt;ref name=Gleaner/&gt; For many years he was unable to drum up sufficient support for his project for a Jamaican equivalent, but in 1889 [[Sir Henry Blake]] arrived as the new governor of Jamaica and gave the idea his blessing. It opened less than two years later.&lt;ref name=Gleaner&gt;[http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0018.html Pieces of the Past. The Great Exhibition of 1891: Jamaica on Show.] ''[[Jamaica Gleaner]]'', 14 January 2002. Retrieved 6 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Sinclair died, aged 58, at 106 King Street, Kingston, on 27 January 1891, on the day of the opening of the Jamaica International Exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jamaica-history.weebly.com/1891-exhibition.html Jamaica International Exhibition, 1891.] Joy Lumsden.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1481">'''Bashmur''' ([[Arabic-language|Arabic]]: آلباشمر, {{Lang-cop|Ⲡⲓϣⲙⲟⲩⲣ}}) was an area in [[Egypt]] in which the [[Copts|Coptic Christians]] [[Peshmurians revolt|revolted]] against Arab rule in the 8th and 9th century.

== Location ==
The boundaries of El Bashmur have not been constant throughout the centuries. Perhaps from the mid-eighth to the mid-ninth century, El Bashmur encompassed the entire marsh region northeast of [[Fuwa, Egypt|Fuwa]] ({{Lang-cop|Ⲙⲉⲗⲉϫ}}, ''Melej'') extending as far to the east as just north of [[Dekernes]]. Later it may have been limited to the eastern part of this area. The name El Bashmur survives in this region as the name of a [[Nile]] canal that breaks off about 4.5 miles (7&amp;nbsp;km) east of [[Mansoura, Egypt]] by El Salamun and runs through the area between the [[Damietta]] arm of the Nile and Dekernes before emptying into the El Sirw canal some 3.5 miles (5.5&amp;nbsp;km) south of [[Dakahlia Governorate|Dakahlia]].

==Biography==
[[Image:Bazilije Stjepan Pandžić --- Drinovci --- 2011-06-24.jpg|thumb|left|Pandžić family house in [[Drinovci]]]]
Bazilije Stjepan Pandžić was born on January 30, 1918 in Drinovci, district [[Ljubuški]], then still part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. He lives in [[Zagreb]]. He finished [[elementary school]] in his hometown in 1929, high school in [[Široki Brijeg]] in 1938, entered the novitiate of the [[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscan Order]] (OFM) in [[Humac (Ljubuški)|Humac]]. He began his [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Theology|theological]] studies in [[Mostar]], and he was ordained to the priesthood in 1941. In 1942 he continued his studies in [[Rome]] and earned his licentiate in 1943.&lt;ref name="Bazilije_Pandžić" /&gt; At the Pontifical Antonianum University he received his doctorate in theology in 1945 with a thesis on the history of Trebinje-Mrkan.&lt;ref&gt;Bazilije Stjepan Pandžić: ''De dioecese tribuniensi et mercanensi'', printed in Rome, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 he studied [[Archival science|archive science]], [[paleography]] and [[diplomacy]] at the Vatican School (associated to Vatican archives), acquiring the title paleographus et archivarius. At the [[Sapienza University of Rome|Roman State University]] (La Sapienza), Department of [[Islamic Science]]s ([[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), he earned his doctorate in philosophy in 1951.&lt;ref name="Bazilije_Pandžić" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRVATSKA_ENCIKLOPEDIJA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wixstatic: [http://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/dbb04a_c50b2b46d00a4bebafda3bc00dfaea4b.pdf ''Isprave / Documents (Bazilije Pandžić)'']. PDF. 2018-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wanted to do research in the Ottoman archives in Istanbul on the history of Bosnia, Herzegovina, Dalmatia and Dubrovnik. However, in 1947 he was appointed to the position of the general service registrar (archivist) of the Franciscan Order (OFM) in Rome, a position which he held up to 1985. In the function of archivist he participated in international conferences in Paris, Moscow, Florence, etc. and co-operated in the publications of their journals. He was also elected to administrative positions in professional associations. In his book Archivistica ecclesiastica which was published by the Vatican's archives in 1967, he summarized his experiences as an archivist. His entire professional life has been dedicated to research in the various Vatican archives. He has published twenty-one scientific books and the three books of memoirs, a large number of scholarly papers, and hundreds of magazine articles. He wrote mainly in [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], and occasionally in English, [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. His works are published in various countries ([[Vatican City]], Italy, [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], Spain, [[Argentina]], United States, Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria and [[Poland]]).&lt;ref name="Bazilije_Pandžić" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRVATSKA_ENCIKLOPEDIJA" /&gt;

For a general history of the Franciscan Order the two most important, monumental volumes are Annales Minorum,&lt;ref&gt;vol. 31/1956, and 32/1964.&lt;/ref&gt; i. e. a continuation of the series which the Irish Franciscan friar Lucas Wadding had started in the 17th century. For the study of the history of missions within the series Historia missionum Ordinis Fratrum Minorum he was responsible for the 4th Volume: Regiones Proximi Orientis et Paeninsulae Balcanicae in 1974.&lt;ref name="Bazilije_Pandžić" /&gt;

As an expert of the Congregation for the Saints he worked under several [[pope]]s. He issued three so-called “positions” (positiones), i.e., historical-critical editions of the life and work of individuals to be canonized.&lt;ref name="Bazilije_Pandžić" /&gt; His first one was on [[Nicholas Tavelic|Nicholas Tavelić]] in 1961&lt;ref&gt;Sacra Rituum Congregatio, Sectio historica, n. 12: Sebenicen. Declarationis martyrii B. Nicolai Tavelić sacerdotis professi Ordinis Fratrum Minorum in odium fidei, ut fertur, in civitate Ierusalem interfecti (+1391), Positio super martyrio ex officio concinnata. Bazilije Pandžić. Typis Polyglotis Vaticanis 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in [[Pope Paul VI]]’s [[canonization]] of Nicholas Tavelić in 1970. Another positio in 1970 brought forth critical source material about the life of Beatrice de Silva, of Spanish origin.&lt;ref&gt;Sacra Congregatio pro causis Sanctorum, Officium Historicum n. 6: Toletana Canonizationis Beatricis de Silva Fundatricis Monialium Franciscalium a Santissima Conceptione († c. 1492), Positio super vita et virtutibus ex officio concinnata. Bazilije Pandžić. Rim 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; The third in 1983 concerned the German Franciscan Liberatus Weiss and companions.&lt;ref&gt;Sacra Congregatio pro causis sanctorum, Officium historicum, n. 108: Viennen. Beatificationis seu declarationis martyrii servi Dei et 2 sociorum O. F. M. in odium fidei, uti fertur, anno 1716 in Aethiopia occisorum Positio super martyrio ex officio concinnata. Bazilije Pandžić. Rim 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bazilije Pandžić is one of the founders and editors of the publishing house ZIRAL in 1970. While in exile 70 books were published before moving in 1991 to Mostar. Bazilije Pandžić was the co-founder of the Croatian Historical Institute in Rome. While being in exile, he published newspaper articles in the Croatian Catholic Messenger and Croatian Almanac of Chicago. After his return to the homeland he participated in various scientific conferences and contributed to journals such as Nova et vetera, Bosna franciscana, Herzegovina franciscana, Kršni zavičaj, Naša ognjišta, Vrutak, etc. Since 1995 he lives in Zagreb where he continued his scholarly research. Most recently, he published several works, including the three-volume Acta Franciscana Hercegovinae in 2003 and 2009, and Herzegovinian Franciscans. Seven centuries with the people in 2001. His collected, scientific works, amount to about 10,000 pages, including 24 monographs.&lt;ref&gt;Bazilije Pandžić: ''Opera omnia typis edita.'' DVD-ROM and PDF. Collegit Zvonko Pandžić. Editio electronico modo confecta. Zagreb: Editiones Tusculanae 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bazilije_Pandžić" /&gt; After the publication of the collected works he published two more books: the second, enlarged edition of the comprehensive work Herzegovinian Franciscans,&lt;ref&gt;Bazilije Pandžić: ''Hercegovački franjevci. Sedam stoljeća s narodom.'' Mostar, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and a book of fundamental-theological reflections titled Ususret Bogu (Towards God).&lt;ref&gt;Zagreb, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Clifton Star Chamber Case''' or ''Clifton vs. Robinson'' refers to a court case that took place in [[early modern England]] in 1600 before the [[Star Chamber]], concerning the [[abduction of children]] by choir schools.

==The case==
In 1600, Henry Clifton, a nobleman from [[Norfolk]],&lt;ref name="Heller"&gt;{{cite book |last= Heller |first= Herbert Jack |date= 2000 |title=Penitent Brothellers: Grace, Sexuality, and Genre in Thomas Middleton's City Comedies|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=osKRuBKU344C |location=Newark |publisher= [[University of Delaware Press]] |page=123 |isbn= 9780874137019 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; sued the Blackfriars company (headed by [[Nathaniel Giles|Gyles]], Robinson, and Evans) for their abduction of his son Thomas Clifton on 13 December that year. Henry Clifton obtained a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] from [[John Fortescue of Salden|Sir John Fortescue]], who granted it using his authority as a member of the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] due to his connections and high social status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mapoflondon6.uvic.ca/BLAC6.htm#CLIF3 |title= Blackfriars Theatre |last=Jenstad |first=Janelle |date=29 September 2017 |website= The Map of Early Modern London |publisher= [[University of Victoria]] |access-date=30 October 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forse |first=James H. |date=1993 |title=Art Imitates Business: Commercial and Political Influences in Elizabethan Theatre |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=r7gHKfW5zSEC&amp;dq |location=Bowling Green |publisher=Bowling Green State University Popular Press |pages=191–194 |isbn= 9780879725952 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bullough |first1= Vern L. |last2= Bullough |first2= Bonnie |date=1993 |title=Cross Dressing, Sex, and Gender|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=KcD7nVelXJgC |location=Philadelphia |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]] |pages=80–81 |isbn= 9780812214314 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for the case is not that Thomas Clifton was forcibly impressed into the choir school (which was entirely legal) but that the boy was made to act in the plays of [[Children of the Chapel]].&lt;ref name="Ackroyd"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ackroyd|first1=Julie|title=Child Actors on the London Stage, Circa 1600: Their Education, Recruitment, and Theatrical Success|date=2017|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=9781845198480|pages=4–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1606, possibly as a result of this case, the royal patent allowing the Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal to impress children into service was revised to stipulate that choristers who had been forcibly impressed would not be "used or employed as Comedians or Stage players."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Performing Childhood in the Early Modern Theatre: The Children's Playing Companies, 1599-1613|last=Lamb|first=Edel|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=978-0230202610|location=Basingstoke|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of the case==
The Clifton case is one of the only surviving objections to the common practice of forcibly impressing boys into ecclesiastical choir schools in medieval and early modern England. It is notable that the objection is to the child's involvement in the controversial children's theater companies of the period. Forcible impressment was royally sanctioned, as is evidenced in letters from [[Elizabeth I]] on 15 July 1597 for the master of the [[Children of the Chapel]].&lt;ref name="Ackroyd"/&gt; The prevalence of the practice is evidenced by documents such as an authorization for the [[Chapel Royal]] in 1420 and ''An Ordinance of the Lordes and Commons Assembled in Parliament, for the Apprehending and Bringing to Condigne Punishment, All Such Lewd Persons as Shall Steale, Sell, Buy, Inveigle, Purloune, Convey, or Receive Any Little Children'' (9 May 1644).&lt;ref name="Ackroyd"/&gt; Besides Thomas Clifton, we also have information on the recruitments of Salmon Pavey, Avery Trussell, John Chappell, [[Nathan Field]], John Motteram, Philip Pykman, and Thomas Grymes by choir schools.&lt;ref name="Ackroyd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corrigan"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=5FoVUIYGXdgC&amp;dq|title=Playhouse Law in Shakespeare's World|last=Corrigan|first=Brian Jay|date=2004|publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson University Press]]|isbn=9780838640227|location=Madison|pages=74–75|author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3067">'''Dino Compagni''' (c. 1255{{snd}}February 26, 1324) was an [[Italy|Italian]] historical writer and political figure.

Dino is an abridgement of Aldobrandino or Ildebrandino. He was born into a ''popolano'' or prosperous family of [[Florence]], supporters of the white party of the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelphs]]. Dino was active in Florentine politics serving as consul for the guild of traders,{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} and later as member of the Signory twice, Prior, and Gonfalonier of Justice. He was democratic in feeling, and was a supporter of the new ordinances of [[Giano della Bella]].{{sfn|Oelsner|1911|p=903}}

[[File:Palazzo compagni, salone, antonio cuccinelli, dino compagni in san giovanni predica la pace tra guelfi e ghibellini.JPG|thumb|right|250px|''Compagni advocates for peace between Guelphs and Ghibellines in a sermon in church of San Giovanni'' by [[Antonio Cuccinelli]].]]

From November 1301 onward, when the White faction lost the power of the Signory to the Black party, Dino was to never serve in a Government council. Because he had been a prior, his property was not forfeit; he was not sent into exile as other members of the White faction.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} When [[Charles of Valois]], the nominee of [[Boniface VIII]], was expected in Florence, Compagni, foreseeing the evils of civil discord, assembled a number of citizens in the church of San Giovanni, and tried to quiet their excited spirits.{{sfn|Oelsner|1911|p=903}}

His ''Cronica'' (chronicle) relates the events that came under his own notice from 1280 to 1312. It bears the stamp of a strong subjectivity. The narrative is constantly personal. Compagni is more of a historian than a chronicler, because he looks for the reasons of events, and makes profound reflections on them. He is one of the important authorities for that period of Florentine history, notwithstanding the mistakes of fact which are to be found in his writings.{{sfn|Oelsner|1911|p=903}}

'''Ephraim George Squier''' (June 17, 1821 – April 17, 1888), usually cited as '''E. G. Squier''', was an American [[archaeologist]] and newspaper editor.

==Biography==
[[File:E G Squier.jpg|thumb]]
Squier was born in [[Bethlehem, New York]], the son of a minister of English heritage and his [[Palatinate (region)|Palatine German]] wife.&lt;ref name=dab&gt;{{Cite DAB|title=Squier, Ephraim George|year=1935|author=Mary Wilhelmine Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early youth he worked on a farm, attended and taught school, studied engineering, and became interested in American antiquities. The [[Panic of 1837]] made an engineering career unfeasible, so he pursued literature and journalism.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; He was associated in the publication of the ''New York State Mechanic'' at [[Albany, New York|Albany]] 1841-1842. In 1843-1848, he engaged in journalism in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] and then edited the [[Chillicothe, Ohio]],&lt;ref name="appletons"&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Squier, Ephraim George|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; weekly newspaper the ''Scioto Gazette''.

During this period, Squier collaborated with physician [[Edwin H. Davis]] on the book, ''[[Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley]]'', which was issued in 1848. The work was a landmark in American scientific research, the study of the prehistoric [[Mound builder (people)|Mound Builders]] of North America, and the early development of archaeology as a scientific discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Stiebing 1984, p.136&lt;/ref&gt; The book was the first volume of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s ''Contributions to Knowledge'' series and the Institution's first publication.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4301/ |title = Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1848 |accessdate = 2013-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Squier and Davis' most important achievements was their systematic approach to analyzing and documenting the sites they surveyed, including the [[Serpent Mound]] in Peebles, [[Ohio]], which they discovered in 1846, and the mapping of the Mound City Group in [[Chillicothe, Ohio]], which has been restored using their data and is now part of [[Hopewell Culture National Historical Park]]. Squier and Davis's collection of ancient Mound objects is now kept at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=35345&amp;peoA=35345-3-7 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was appointed special chargé d'affaires to all the [[Central America]]n states in 1849, and negotiated treaties with [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]], and [[San Salvador]]. In 1853 he made a second visit to Central America to examine a line for a projected interoceanic railroad, and to make further study of the archaeology of the country. In 1856 he received the medal of the [[French Geographical Society]] for his researches. In 1858, he married [[Miriam Leslie|Miriam Florence Folline]] who had recently had a previous marriage annulled.&lt;ref name="dab"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DAB|title=Leslie, Miriam|author=A. Everett Peterson|year=1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1860, he became editor-in-chief for [[Frank Leslie]]'s publishing house, and supervised the publication of the first two volumes of ''[[Frank Leslie's Pictorial History of the American Civil War]]''.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; In 1863 Squier was appointed U. S. commissioner to [[Peru]], where he made an exhaustive investigation of [[Inca]] remains and took numerous photographs of them. He later gave a series of 12 lectures on "The Inca Empire" for the [[Lowell Institute]] for their 1866-67 season.&lt;ref&gt;Harriet Knight Smith, [https://archive.org/details/historyoflowelli00smitiala ''The history of the Lowell Institute''], Boston:  Lamson, Wolffe and Co., 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868 he was appointed consul-general of Honduras at New York, and in 1871 he was elected the first president of the [[Anthropological Institute of New York]].&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt; He conducted ethnological studies, especially in Nicaragua, Honduras and Peru.

On returning from Peru, he continued working for Frank Leslie, but gave it up when his health failed. In 1873, his wife divorced him, and married Leslie a year later.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; In 1874 his health became so seriously impaired as to preclude further original research, and though he subsequently recovered sufficiently to direct the final preparation and revision of his work on Peru for publication, the affection resulted in his death. He was a member of numerous historical, archaeological, and scientific societies.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt; He died in [[Brooklyn]], New York.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

'''Elizabeth Arden, Inc.''' is a major [[United States|American]] [[cosmetics]], [[skin care]] and [[fragrance]] company founded by [[Elizabeth Arden]]. As of September 7, 2016, the company is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Revlon|Revlon, Inc.]]&lt;ref name=Gen1&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160907006742/en/Revlon-Announces-Completion-Elizabeth-Arden-Acquisition | title=Official Press Release | date=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Elizabeth Arden - Magazine ad - Zan-e Rooz, Issue 181 - 31 August 1968.jpg|thumb|A 1968 Magazine ad of Elizabeth Arden in Persian, [[Zan-e Rooz]].]]
The company was founded as ''Red Door'' salon on [[Fifth Avenue]] in 1910. Arden's company was then sold to [[Eli Lilly and Company]] in 1971 for $38 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|38000000|1971|r=0}}}} today). Eli Lilly and Company sold Arden to [[Fabergé (cosmetics)|Fabergé]] in 1987 for $657 million. Arden's cosmetics company continues to trade today, and was bought from [[Unilever]] in 2003 by FFI for $225 million, a New York company. They changed the company's name to Elizabeth Arden, which is publicly listed ({{NASDAQ|RDEN}}). The company is located in [[Pembroke Pines, Florida]], a suburb of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.elizabetharden.com/corporate-locations.php|title=Corporate Locations, Elizabeth Arden, Inc.|author=Elizabeth Arden Webmaster|work=elizabetharden.com|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company continues to offer color coordinated make-up sets, as well as an extensive line of skin care products and treatments.

Past 'faces' of Elizabeth Arden were [[Vendela Kirsebom]] during the 1980s, [[Amber Valletta]] to the mid-1990s, and [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]. On 2 December 2014, the company announced [[Karlina Caune]] would be the new face of the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.elizabetharden.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=98237&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1994025|title=Elizabeth Arden - a global prestige beauty fragrance cosmetics and skincare products company - Press Release|author=Elizabeth Arden Webmaster|work=elizabetharden.com|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Arden's death, some of the company's focus has shifted to the development of a number of fragrance lines. The company's signature fragrance is called "Red Door" named after their day spas which are called "Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salons". Other fragrance within their own line are "Fifth Avenue", "Green Tea", "Provocative Woman", "Mediterranean", "Pretty", "Red Door Aura" and their newest, "Untold". The company also holds the license to [[Britney Spears]] [[Britney Spears products#Fragrances|fragrances]], as well as the [[Hilary Duff]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Mariah Carey]] fragrance collections. [[Juicy Couture]]'s "Viva la Juicy", "Couture Couture", and "Peace, Love &amp; Juicy Couture", and [[Justin Bieber]] and [[Taylor Swift]]'s fragrance collections are recent additions to the Arden portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taylorswift.com/news#57124|title=TAYLOR LAUNCHES WONDERSTRUCK|publisher=TaylorSwift.com|accessdate=July 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, as the first ever "Pin to give it" campaign on [[Pinterest]], Elizabeth Arden aims to supply women with cancer with confidence boosting make up products. This is a part of the "Look Good Feel Better" campaign which the company has been a part of for several years. The LGFB is dedicated to help cancer patients to manage the appearance related side effects of cancer treatment.

==Sale to Revlon==

In June 2016, US cosmetics company [[Revlon]] announced its intention to buy Elizabeth Arden Inc. for US $870 million (£611m).

{{Emotion}}
The study of the '''evolution of emotions''' dates back to the 19th century. [[Evolution]] and [[natural selection]] has been applied to the study of [[human communication]], mainly by [[Charles Darwin]] in his 1872 work, ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.&lt;ref name ="Darwin2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Darwin|first1= C.|title= The expression of the emotions in man and animals|year= 2007|origyear= 1872|publisher= Filiquarian|location= New York |isbn= 0-8014-1990-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Darwin researched the expression of [[emotion]]s in an effort to support his theory of evolution.  He proposed that much like other [[Phenotypic trait|trait]]s found in animals, emotions also evolved and were adapted over time.&lt;ref name="Hess"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hess|first1= U.|last2= Thibault|first2= P.|year= 2009|title= Darwin and Emotion Expression|journal= American Psychologist|volume= 64|issue= 2|pages= 120–8|pmid= 19203144 |doi= 10.1037/a0013386}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work looked at not only [[facial expression]]s in [[animals]] and specifically [[human]]s, but attempted to point out parallels between [[behavior]]s in humans and other animals.

According to modern evolutionary theory, different emotions evolved at different times. Primal emotions, such as fear, are associated with ancient parts of the brain and presumably evolved among our premammal ancestors. Filial emotions, such as a human mother's love for her offspring, seem to have evolved among early mammals. Social emotions, such as guilt and pride, evolved among social primates. Sometimes, a more recently evolved part of the brain moderates an older part of the brain, such as when the cortex moderates the [[amygdala]]'s fear response. [[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] consider human emotions to be best adapted to the life our ancestors led in nomadic foraging bands.

==Origins==
Darwin's original plan was to include his findings about expression of emotions in a chapter of his work, ''[[The Descent of Man|The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' (Darwin, 1871) but found that he had enough material for a whole book. It was based on [[observations]], both those around him and of people in many parts of the world. One important observation he made was that even in individuals who were born [[Blindness|blind]], body and facial expressions displayed are similar to those of anyone else. The ideas found in his book on [[universality (philosophy)|universality]] of emotions were intended to go against Sir [[Charles Bell|Charles Bell's]] 1844 claim&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bell|first1= C.|title= The anatomy and philosophy of expression as connected with the fine arts|edition= 3|year= 1844|publisher= John Murray|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; that human facial [[muscles]] were created to give them the unique ability to express emotions.&lt;ref name=Hess/&gt; The main purpose of Darwin's work was to support the theory of evolution by demonstrating that emotions in humans and other animals are similar. Most of the similarities he found were between [[species]] closely [[related]], but he found some similarities between distantly related species as well. He proposed the idea that emotional states are adaptive, and therefore only those able to express certain emotions passed on their characteristics.&lt;ref name=Darwin2/&gt;

===Darwin's principles===
In the 1872 work, Darwin proposed three principles. The first of the three is the "principle of serviceable habits," which he defined as useful habits reinforced previously, and then inherited by offspring. He used as an example contracting of eyebrows (furrowing the brow), which he noted is serviceable to prevent too much light from entering the eyes. He also said that the raising of eyebrows serves to increase the [[field of vision]]. He cited examples of people attempting to remember something and raising their brows, as though they could "see" what they were trying to remember.

The second of the principles is that of [[antithesis]]. While some habits are serviceable, Darwin proposed that some actions or habits are carried out merely because they are opposite in nature to a serviceable habit, but are not serviceable themselves. Shrugging of the shoulders is an example Darwin used of antithesis, because it has no service. Shoulder shrugging is a passive expression, and very opposite of a confident or aggressive expression.&lt;ref name=Darwin2/&gt;

The third of the principles is expressive habits, or nervous discharge from the nervous system. This principle proposes that some habits are performed because of a build-up to the [[nervous system]], which causes a [[:wikt:discharge|discharge]] of the [[Psychomotor agitation|excitement]]. Examples include foot and finger tapping, as well as vocal expressions and expressions of [[anger]]. Darwin noted that many animals rarely make noises, even when in [[pain]], but under extreme circumstances they vocalize in response to pain and [[fear]].&lt;ref name=Darwin2/&gt;

==Research==
{{See also|Emotion in animals}}
[[Paul Ekman]] is most noted in this field for conducting research involving facial expressions of emotions. His work provided data to back up Darwin's ideas about universality of facial expressions, even across cultures. He conducted research by showing photographs exhibiting expressions of basic emotion to people and asking them to identify what emotion was being expressed. In 1971, Ekman and Wallace Friesen presented to people in a preliterate culture a story involving a certain emotion, along with photographs of specific facial expressions. The photographs had been previously used in studies using subjects from [[Western cultures]]. When asked to choose, from two or three photographs, the emotion being expressed in the story, the preliterate subjects' choices matched those of the Western subjects most of the time. These results indicated that certain expressions are universally associated with particular emotions, even in instances in which the people had little or no exposure to Western culture. The only emotions the preliterate people found hard to distinguish between were fear and [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]].&lt;ref name="Friesen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ekman|first1= P|last2= Friesen|first2= W|year= 1971|title= Constants across cultures in the face and emotion|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 17|issue= 2|pages=124–9 |url=http://www.ekmaninternational.com/ResearchFiles/Constants-Across-Cultures-In-The-Face-And-Emotion.pdf|pmid= 5542557 |doi= 10.1037/h0030377}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ekman noted that while universal expressions do not necessarily prove Darwin's theory that they evolved, they do provide strong evidence of the possibility.&lt;ref name="Ekman 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ekman|first1= P.|year= 1993|title= Facial expression and emotion|journal= American Psychologist|volume= 48|issue= 4|pages= 384–92|url=http://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/_private/gradsoc_articles/facial%20expressions/Ekman%201993%20Am%20psych.pdf|pmid= 8512154 |doi= 10.1037/0003-066X.48.4.384 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned the similarities between human expressions and those of other [[primates]], as well as an overall universality of certain expressions to back up Darwin's ideas. The expressions of emotion that Ekman noted as most universal based on research are: anger, fear, [[disgust]], [[sadness]], and [[enjoyment]].&lt;ref name="Ekman 1993"/&gt;

A common view is that facial expressions initially served a non-communicative [[adaptive]] function. Thus, the widened eyes in the facial expression of [[fear]] have been shown to increase the visual field and the speed of moving the eyes which helps finding and following threats. The wrinkled nose and mouth of the facial expression of [[disgust]] limit the intake of foul-smelling and possibly dangerous air and particles. Later, such reactions, which could be observed by other members of the group, increasingly become more distinctive and exaggerated in order to fulfill a primarily socially communicative function. This communicative function can dramatically or subtly influence the behavior of other members in the group. Thus, rhesus monkeys or human infants can learn to fear potential dangers based on only the facial expressions of fear of other group members or parents. Seeing fear expressions increases the tendency for flight responses while seeing anger expressions increases the tendency for fight responses. [[Classical conditioning]] studies have found that it is easier to create a pairing between a negative stimulant and anger/fear expressions than between a negative stimulant and a happiness expression. Cross-cultural studies and studies on the congenitally [[Blindness|blind]] have found that these groups display the same expressions of shame and pride in situations related to social status. These expressions have clear similarities to displays of submission and dominance by other primates. Humans viewing expression of pride automatically assign a higher social status to such individuals than to those expressing other emotions.&lt;ref name=Shariff2011/&gt;

[[Robert Zajonc]], a University of Michigan psychologist, published two reviews in 1989 of the "facial efference theory of emotion", also known as [[facial feedback hypothesis|facial feedback theory]],&lt;ref name="Adelmann "&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adelmann |first1 = P.

The theory is based on the idea that increasing the temperature of portions of the hypothalamus can produce aggressive behavior, whereas cooling can produce relaxation.  Our emotional language has comparable descriptors, such as "hot-head" and "cool-breezy".  The theory offers an explanation for the evolution of common facial expressions of emotion in mammals.  Little experimental work has been done to extend the theory, however.

[[Carroll Izard]], a [[psychologist]] who is known for his work with emotions, discussed gains and losses associated with the evolution of emotions. He said that discrete emotion experiences emerge in ontogeny before language or conceptual structures that frame the qualia known as discrete emotion feelings are acquired. He noted that in evolution, when humans gained the [[wikt:capability|capability]] of expressing themselves with [[language]], which contributed greatly to emotional evolution. Not only can humans [[:wikt:articulate|articulate]] and share their emotions, they can use their experiences to foresee and take appropriate action in future experiences. He did, however, raise the question of whether or not humans have lost some of their [[empathy]] for one another, citing things such as murder and crime against one another as destructive.&lt;ref name="Izard"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Izard|first1= C.|year= 2009|title= Emotion Theory and Research: Highlights, Unanswered Questions, and Emerging Issues|journal= Annual Review of Psychology|volume= 60|issue= 1|pages= 1–25|pmid= 18729725 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163539 |pmc= 2723854 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph LeDoux]] focuses much of his research on the emotion fear. Fear can be evoked by two systems in the [[brain]], both involving the [[thalamus]] and the [[amygdala]]: one old, short and fast, the other more recently evolved, more circuitous and slower. In the older system, sensory information travels directly and quickly from the thalamus to the amygdala where it elicits the autonomic and motor responses we call fear. In the younger system, sensory information travels from the thalamus to the relevant cortical sensory areas (touch to the somatosensory cortex, vision to the visual cortex, etc.) and on to frontal association areas, where appraisal occurs. These frontal areas communicate directly with the amygdala and, in light of appraisal, may reduce or magnify the amygdala's fear response. If you glimpse what looks like a snake, long before your younger frontal areas have had time to determine it is a stick, the old thalamus-amygdala system will have evoked fear. LeDoux hypothesizes that the old fast system persists because a behavioral response at the first hint of danger is of little consequence when mistaken but may mean the difference between life and death when appropriate.&lt;ref name= LeDoux1998&gt;{{cite book |last1= LeDoux|first1= J|editor1-first= JM|editor1-last= Jenkins|editor2-first= K|editor2-last= Oatley|editor3-first= NL|editor3-last= Stein|title= Human Emotions: A reader|edition= |year= 1998|publisher= [[Blackwell Publishers]]|location= Malden, Massachusetts|isbn= 0-631-20747-3|pages=98–111 |chapter= The emotional brain|chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=kB19aJKJLoEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=the+emotional+brain+the+mysterious&amp;ots=trmA2l5D2r&amp;sig=XW8_YPeQTeUTz6wxPbbx1MxgAmM#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20emotional%20brain%20the%20mysterious&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LeDoux1996&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ledoux|first1= J.|year= 1996|title= Emotion Theory and Research: Highlights, Unanswered Questions, and Emerging Issues|journal= Annual Review of Psychology|volume= 60|issue= 1|pages= 1–25|pmid=18729725|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163539|pmc=2723854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ferminchavez.jpg|right|thumb|Fermín Chávez in 1979]]

'''Fermín Chávez''' ([[Nogoyá]] 13 July 1924 – 28 May 2006) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] historian, poet and journalist, born in El Pueblito, a small town near [[Nogoyá]], province of [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]]. He studied humanities in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], philosophy in [[Buenos Aires]], and devoted three years to the study of [[theology]], [[canon law]], [[archaeology]] and [[Biblical Hebrew|Ancient Hebrew]] in [[Cusco|Cuzco]], [[Peru]].

Under the rule of [[Juan Perón]] (1946–1955) he was a militant [[Justicialist Party|Justicialist]], close to [[Eva Perón]], whom he met in 1950. He joined the [[Peronism|Peronist]] cause along with other [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] intellectuals, like his friend [[José María Castiñeira de Dios]]. He then formed part of the resistance to those who [[Revolución Libertadora|ousted Perón]] in 1955, and was a member of the delegation that returned with Perón to Argentina after his exile in [[Spain]], in 1973.

His journalistic career started in 1947 the nationalistic newspaper ''Tribuna''. He wrote in Peronist publications and in the newspapers ''[[La Capital]]'' ([[Rosario]]), ''La Opinión'', ''Mayoría'', and ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]''. He also collaborated with magazines, dictionaries and encyclopedias; in 1949 founded the poetry maganize ''Nombre'', and in 1967, ''Ahijuna''. He was the press chief of the state oil company [[Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales|YPF]] from 1970 to 1973, and worked in the official press of the city of Buenos Aires during the administration of General José Embrioni, since 1973. He was also a History of Education in the Philosophy faculty of the [[Universidad de Buenos Aires]].

As a revisionist, he questioned the traditional, "official" version of Argentine history, such as the view of founding fathers as flawless, unquestionable idols. He wrote more than 40 books about different aspects of this history, including some about ''[[caudillo]]s'', [[Peronism]],  and [[Che Guevara]], and supervised an edition of the complete works of Juan Perón. He also completed [[José María Rosa]]'s ''Historia Argentina''. In 2004 he published a ''History and Anthology of [[Gaucho|Gauchesque]] Poetry''.

Chávez died in 2006 at the age of 81, in Buenos Aires, after being hospitalized due to heart problems.

'''Florencia Mallon''' (born 28 October 1951) is an American [[historian]] of [[Latin America]] and [[colonialism]].

==Life and work==
Florencia Elizabeth Mallon was born in [[Santiago, Chile]] on 28 October 1951. She attended [[high school]] in [[Argentina]], [[Colombia]] and the [[United States]]. Mallon graduated from [[Harvard University]] with a [[B.A.]], [[magna cum laude]] in literature and history in 1973. A graduate research seminar with [[John Womack]] that she took as a junior sparked her interest in [[Latin American history]] and she was awarded her [[M.A.]], [[M.Phil.]], and [[Ph.D.]] in that subject by [[Yale University]] in 1975, 1976 and 1980 respectively. Mallon married her husband, Steven J. Stern in 1978 and they have two children together. Her first teaching job was at the [[Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina]] in [[Lima, Peru]] where she co-taught a mini-seminar with her husband. She then became an instructor and then an [[assistant professor]] at [[Marquette University]] in 1979–82. Mallon was then offered a position as an assistant professor of modern Latin American history at the [[University of Wisconsin]] in 1982. She was promoted to associate professor two years later and then to full professor in 1988. Her second book, ''Peasant and Nation: The Making of Postcolonial Mexico and Peru'', was designated a Centennial Book by the [[University of California Press]] and received the Bryce Wood Award from the [[Latin American Studies Association]]. "In 1995 she received the University of Wisconsin’s Emil H. Steiger Distinguished Teaching Award as well as the history department’s Karen Fredrikka Falk Johnson Distinguished Teaching Award."&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon &amp; Cosner, pp. 149–50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Forensic genealogy is defined in a legal context, specifically when conducting research in the following manner:
*Estate or [[probate research]] to identify unknown and [[missing heir]]s, and potentially provide expert testimony in a courtroom;
**Unknown heir cases typically involve an individual's estate who died [[intestate]], but may also be the result of a [[remainderman]] predeceasing the [[testator]] or [[testatrix]] of a will.&lt;ref name="PaBarAssoc76.125"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ramage |first1=Michael S. |title=Missing and Unknown Heir Law Practice and Procedure |journal=Pennsylvania Bar Association Quarterly |date=2005 |volume=76 |issue=July |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Missing heir cases involve locating [[beneficiaries]] of a will.&lt;ref name="PaBarAssoc76.125" /&gt;
*Military repatriation: Assisting branches of the United States military in reuniting the remains of service members with their families using DNA analysis (a.k.a. [[DNA profiling]]);
*[[Kinship]] determination: Identifying family members in regard to cases of adoption, foster care, and guardianship;
*Land and real estate issues involving title, [[adverse possession]], rights of way, [[lis pendens]], or [[muniment of title]], and oil, gas, and [[mineral rights]] and royalties. Oil, gas, and mineral rights cases may be dealt with the same as unknown and missing heir cases, or [[quiet title]] actions, depending on the state with jurisdiction and the situation of the case;&lt;ref name="RealPropJournal10"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=American Bar Association |first1=Committee on Administration and Distribution of Decedent’s Estates |title=Clearing Title of Heirs to Intestate Real Property |journal=Real Property, Probate and Trust Journal |date=1975 |volume=10 |issue=Fall |page=454 |jstor=20781390}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|454}}
**Established law in Texas gives landowners the rights to oil and gas beneath their property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oil &amp; Gas Exploration and Surface Ownership |url=http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/media/7124/surfaceownerinfo.pdf |website=Railroad Commission of Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Research to help clients establish U.S. citizenship or support [[dual citizenship]] in a foreign country;
*Assisting coroner’s offices in identifying relatives of unclaimed remains;
*[[Provenance]], [[class action]] claimants, [[intellectual property rights]], etc.

A alternative definition of the field has been explained by author and scientist [[Colleen M. Fitzpatrick]], PhD, in her 2005 book ''Forensic Genealogy'',&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Fitzpatrick |first = Colleen |title = Forensic Genealogy |publisher = Rice Book Press |date = 2005 |url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Forensic_Genealogy.html?id=AKZpAAAAMAAJ |isbn =978-0976716006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a [[forensic science]] approach is used in genealogical research. The author describes various research methods, approaches, and genealogical knowledge she has determined to be forensic in nature:
*Examining photographs for clues to pinpoint a place or time of an event. For example, a house in the background of a photo may reveal an address number, or the type of clothing worn by people can suggest when a picture was taken. Colleen Fitzpatrick has stated “The most important lesson a digital detective can ever learn is to notice what a photograph is really saying.”;&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick" /&gt;{{rp|4}}
*Estimating birth dates by scrutinizing marriage age laws of a jurisdiction;
*Researching “the historical context of your family”&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick" /&gt;{{rp|3}} to provide more insight into their lives;
*Understanding that immigrant name changes did not occur at [[Ellis Island]], but either at the immigrant’s [[embarkation]] point or years after entry to the United States;
*Analyzing [[DNA]] test results to study both matches and non-matches, as well as estimating one’s [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA), and discovering [[non-paternity event]]s;
*Using a Y-chromosome [[cladogram]] “to identify the main branches of a family”; etc.&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Fitzpatrick |first = Colleen |title = Forensic Genealogy |publisher = Rice Book Press |date = 2005 |url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Forensic_Genealogy.html?id=AKZpAAAAMAAJ |isbn =978-0976716006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

'''Frederic Logan Paxson''' (February 23, 1877 in Philadelphia&amp;nbsp;– October 24, 1948 in [[Berkeley, California]]) was an American historian. He had also been President of the [[Organization of American Historians|Mississippi Valley Historical Association]]. He had undergraduate and PhD degrees from the [[University of Pennsylvania]], as well as a master's from [[Harvard University]]. He taught at Wisconsin (1910 to 1932) as successor to [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] and the University of California-Berkeley from 1932 to 1947.

As a historian he was an authority on the [[American frontier]]. His [[1925 Pulitzer Prize]] was for ''History of the American Frontier, 1763-1893''.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Americana'' (1969 edition), v 21 page 431&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
Among his students were [[Earl S. Pomeroy]] and Ira Clark.  They admired his teaching greatly. Clark said Paxson gave students "a sense of participating in his exploration of the past" and of "contact with living men and problems of narrative."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; Pomeroy said that Paxson was not given to philosophical speculation, but rather spoke of "techniques and of specific problems and their meaning more than of validity in the abstract." Paxson also advised his students to make an attempt at synthesis, however tentative and inexact. Pomeroy notes that Paxson had a masterful knowledge of political history and "found the political framework, among other conventional frameworks, indispensable in telling a general story."  However Paxson also insisted on the importance of economic and social history and had himself published on such  subjects as the rise of sport and the highway movement.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

Paxson coined the term "Historical Engineering" to describe the wartime work he had done in revising textbooks to suit the ''mood'' of the era of the World War,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Novick | first1 = Peter | title = That Noble Dream: The 'Objectivity Question' and the American Historical Profession (Ideas in Context) | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | pages = 128 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mhiw__MLyVAC&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;ots=qNnsY9Hin9&amp;dq=Historical%20Engineering%20PAXSON&amp;pg=PA128#v=onepage&amp;q=Historical%20Engineering%20PAXSON&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-08-23 | isbn = 978-0-521-35745-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; by "explaining the issues of the war that we might the better win it."

==Works==
At Pennsylvania, Paxton studied history, international law, and economics. His major advisor was the historian [[John Bach McMaster]], who encouraged him to read widely and use new sources such as newspapers, in addition to the archival resources in London and Washington needed for diplomatic studies. After publishing his dissertation in 1903 on American foreign policy regarding the independence of the South American republics in the 1820s, he moved away from diplomatic issues to Western studies. He started with a series of studies on Colorado, planning a book that was never finished. He then moved to broader narrative histories of the frontier, culminating with his prize-winning  ''History of the American Frontier, 1763-1893'' in  1924. It covers a very wide sweep of topics, with unusual strength in handling violent relations between the frontiersman and the Indians. Paxson emphasized the impact on people of the process of moving to the west, downplaying the static aspects of specific localities.  During the First World War, despite his Quaker upbringing, he served as a major in the War Department's historical bureau and used his writing skills to explain the historical context of American policies.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner. pp 143-152.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Quentin_Massys_-_Portrait_of_a_Man_-_National_Gallery_of_Scotland.jpg|200px|thumb|16th-century painting of a [[civil law notary]], by Flemish painter [[Quentin Massys]]. A civil law notary is roughly analogous to a common law [[solicitor]], except that, unlike solicitors, civil law notaries do not practice litigation.]]

The [[legal profession]] has its origins in ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. Although in Greece it was forbidden to take payment for pleading the [[Lawsuit|cause]] of another, the rule was widely flouted. After the time of [[Claudius]], lawyers (''iuris consulti'') could practise openly, although their remuneration was limited. A skilled and regulated profession developed gradually during the late Roman Empire and the [[Byzantine Empire]]: [[advocate]]s acquired more status, and a separate class of [[Notary|notaries]] (''tabelliones'') appeared.

In [[Western Europe]], the legal profession went into decline during the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]], re-emerging during the 12th and 13th centuries in the form of experts on [[canon law]]. The profession started to be regulated and to extend its reach to civil as well as ecclesiastical law.

==Ancient Greece and Rome==
The earliest people  who could be described as "lawyers" were probably the [[orators]] of ancient [[Athens]] (see [[History of Athens]]). However, Athenian orators faced serious structural obstacles. First, there was a rule that individuals were supposed to plead their own cases, which was soon bypassed by the increasing tendency of individuals to ask a "friend" for assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Bonner, ''Lawyers and Litigants in Ancient Athens: The Genesis of the Legal Profession'' (New York: Benjamin Blom, 1927), 202.&lt;/ref&gt; However, around the middle of the fourth century, the Athenians disposed of the perfunctory request for a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, a more serious obstacle, which the Athenian orators never completely overcame, was the rule that no one could take a fee to plead the cause of another. This law was widely disregarded in practice, but was never abolished, which meant that orators could ''never'' present themselves as legal professionals or experts.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, 206.&lt;/ref&gt; They had to uphold the [[legal fiction]] that they were merely an ordinary citizen generously helping out a friend for free, and thus they could never organize into a real profession&amp;mdash;with professional associations and titles and all the other pomp and circumstance&amp;mdash;like their modern counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, 208–209.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if one narrows the definition to those men who could practice the legal profession openly and legally, then the first lawyers would have to be the orators of [[ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazard, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Crook (classicist)|John A. Crook]], ''Law and Life of Ancient Rome'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1967), 90.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ban on fees was abolished by [[Claudius|Emperor Claudius]], who legalized advocacy as a profession and allowed the Roman advocates to become the first lawyers who could practice openly&amp;mdash;but he also imposed a fee ceiling of 10,000 [[sestertius|sesterces]].&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 90. Crook cites [[Tacitus]], ''Annals'' VI, 5 and 7 for this point. For more information about the complex political affair that forced Emperor Claudius to decide this issue, see ''The Annals of Tacitus'', Book VI ([[Franklin Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Franklin Center, PA]]: The Franklin Library, 1982), 208.&lt;/ref&gt; This was apparently not much money; the [[Satires of Juvenal]] complain that there was no money in working as an advocate.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Like their Greek contemporaries, early Roman advocates were trained in [[rhetoric]], not law, and the judges before whom they argued were also not law-trained.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; But very early on, unlike Athens, Rome developed a class of specialists who were learned in the law, known as jurisconsults (''iuris consulti'').&lt;ref name="Crook, 88"&gt;Crook, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisconsults were wealthy amateurs who dabbled in law as an intellectual hobby. Advocates and ordinary people also went to jurisconsults for legal opinions.&lt;ref name="Crook, 88"/&gt; Thus, the Romans were the first to have a class of people who spent their days thinking about legal problems, and this is why their law became so "precise, detailed, and technical."&lt;ref name="Crook, 88"/&gt;

During the [[Roman Republic]] and the early [[Roman Empire]], jurisconsults and advocates were unregulated, since the former were amateurs and the latter were technically illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Any citizen could call himself an advocate or a legal expert, though whether people believed him would depend upon his personal reputation. This changed once Claudius legalized the legal profession. By the start of the [[Byzantine Empire]], the legal profession had become well-established, heavily regulated, and highly stratified.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. M. Jones, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: A Social, Economic, and Administrative Survey'', vol. 1 ([[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman, OK]]: University of Oklahoma Press, 1964), 507.&lt;/ref&gt; The centralization and bureaucratization of the profession was apparently gradual at first, but accelerated during the reign of Emperor [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Schulz, ''History of Roman Legal Science'' ([[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 1946), 113.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the jurisconsults went into decline during the imperial period.&lt;ref&gt;Schulz, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of Fritz Schulz, "by the fourth century things had changed in the eastern Empire: advocates now were really lawyers."&lt;ref&gt;Schulz, 268.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by the fourth century, advocates had to be enrolled on the bar of a court to argue before it, they could only be attached to one court at a time, and there were restrictions (which came and went depending upon who was emperor) on how many advocates could be enrolled at a particular court.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 508–510.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 380s, advocates were studying law in addition to rhetoric (thus reducing the need for a separate class of jurisconsults); in 460, [[Leo I the Thracian|Emperor Leo]] imposed a requirement that new advocates seeking admission had to produce testimonials from their teachers; and by the sixth century, a regular course of legal study lasting about four years was required for admission.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 512–513.&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius's fee ceiling lasted all the way into the Byzantine period, though by then it was measured at 100 [[Solidus (coin)|solidi]].&lt;ref name="Jones, 511"&gt;Jones, 511.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, it was widely evaded, either through demands for maintenance and expenses or a ''sub rosa'' [[barter (economics)|barter]] transaction.&lt;ref name="Jones, 511"/&gt; The latter was cause for disbarment.&lt;ref name="Jones, 511"/&gt;

The notaries (''tabelliones'') appeared in the late Roman Empire. Like their modern-day descendants, the civil law notaries, they were responsible for drafting wills, conveyances, and contracts.&lt;ref name="Jones, 515"&gt;Jones, 515.&lt;/ref&gt; They were ubiquitous and most villages had one.&lt;ref name="Jones, 515"/&gt; In Roman times, notaries were widely considered to be inferior to advocates and jurisconsults.&lt;ref name="Jones, 515"/&gt; Roman notaries were not law-trained; they were often barely literate, with an unfavorable reputation for wrapping simple transactions in mountains of legal jargon, since they were paid by the line.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
[[Image:Pieter Brueghel the Younger - Village Lawyer - WGA3633.jpg|300px|thumb|''Village Lawyer'' by [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], 1621 ]]

After the fall of the western Empire and the onset of the Dark Ages, the legal profession of Western Europe collapsed. As James Brundage has explained: "[by 1140], no one in Western Europe could properly be described as a professional lawyer or a professional canonist in anything like the modern sense of the term 'professional.' "&lt;ref&gt;James A. Brundage, "The Rise of the Professional Jurist in the Thirteenth Century," &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;20 Syracuse J. Int'l L. &amp; Com. 185&lt;/span&gt; (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 1150 onward, a small but increasing number of men became experts in [[canon law]] but only in furtherance of other occupational goals, such as serving the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as priests.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1190 to 1230, however, there was a crucial shift in which some men began to practice canon law as a lifelong profession in itself.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The legal profession's return was marked by the renewed efforts of church and state to regulate it. In 1231 two French councils mandated that lawyers had to swear an oath of admission before practicing before the bishop's courts in their regions, and a similar oath was promulgated by the papal legate in London in 1237.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 188.&lt;/ref&gt; During the same decade, Frederick II, the emperor of the Kingdom of Sicily, imposed a similar oath in his civil courts.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1250 the nucleus of a new legal profession had clearly formed.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The new trend towards professionalization culminated in a controversial proposal at the [[Second Council of Lyon]] in 1275 that ''all'' ecclesiastical courts should require an oath of admission.&lt;ref name="Brundage, 189"&gt;Brundage, 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not adopted by the council, it was highly influential in many such courts throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Brundage, 189"/&gt; The civil courts in England also joined the trend towards professionalization; in 1275 a statute was enacted that prescribed punishment for professional lawyers guilty of deceit, and in 1280 the mayor's court of the city of London promulgated regulations concerning admission procedures, including the administering of an oath.&lt;ref&gt;John Hamilton Baker, ''An Introduction to British Legal History'', 3rd ed. (London: Butterworths, 1990), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Hopi]]''' maintain a complex religious and mythological tradition stretching back over centuries.  However, it is difficult to definitively state what all Hopis as a group believe. Like the oral traditions of many other societies, Hopi mythology is not always told consistently and each Hopi [[mesa]], or even each village, may have its own version of a particular story.  But, "in essence the variants of the Hopi myth bear marked similarity to one another."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Vecsey.  ''The Emergence of the Hopi People'', ''in'' American Indian Quarterly, vol. 7, no. 3, American Indian Religions, 70 (Summer 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also not clear that those stories which are told to non-Hopis, such as anthropologists and ethnographers, represent genuine Hopi beliefs or are merely stories told to the curious while keeping safe the Hopi's more sacred doctrines.  As folklorist [[Harold Courlander]] states, "there is a Hopi reticence about discussing matters that could be considered ritual secrets or religion-oriented traditions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Courlander]]. ''The Fourth World of the Hopis: The Epic Story of the Hopi Indians as Preserved in their Legends and Traditions'', 201 University of New Mexico Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the Hopis have always been willing to assimilate foreign ideas into their cosmology if they are proven effective for such practical necessities as bringing rain.&lt;ref name="Susan E. James 2000"&gt;Susan E. James. "Some Aspects of the Aztec Religion in the Hopi Kachina Cult", ''Journal of the Southwest'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The Hopi had at least some contact with Europeans as early as the 16th century, and some believe that European Christian traditions may have entered Hopi cosmology at some point. Indeed, Spanish missions were built in several Hopi villages starting in 1629 and were in operation until the [[Pueblo Revolt]] of 1680. However, after the revolt, it was the Hopi alone of all the [[Pueblo peoples|Pueblo]] tribes who kept the Spanish out of their villages permanently, and regular contact with whites did not begin again until nearly two centuries later. The Hopi mesas have therefore been seen as "relatively unacculturated" at least through the early 20th century, and it may be posited that the European influence on the core themes of Hopi mythology was slight.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

==Major deities==
[[File:Hopi Tawa Mural.jpeg|thumb|300px|Tawa, the sun spirit and creator in Hopi mythology.]]

Most Hopi accounts of creation center around Tawa, the sun spirit. Tawa is the creator, and it was he who formed the "First World" out of Tokpella, or endless space, as well as its original inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Coulander. ''The Fourth World of the Hopis: The Epic Story of the Hopi Indians as Preserved in their Legends and Traditions'', 17 University of New Mexico Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  It is still traditional for Hopi mothers to seek a blessing from the sun for their newborn children.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Udall.  Me and Mine: The Life Story of Helen Sekaquaptewa, 7 (University of Arizona Press, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts have it that Tawa, or Taiowa, first created Sotuknang, whom he called his nephew. Taiowa then sent Sotuknang to create the nine universes according to his plan, and it was Sotuknang who created Spider Woman, or [[Spider Grandmother]].{{cn|date=December 2016}} Spider Woman served as a messenger for the creator and was an intercessor between the deity and the people. In some versions of the Hopi creation myth, it is she who creates all life under the direction of Sotuknang.{{cn|date=December 2016}} Yet other stories tell that life was created by Hard Being Woman of the West and Hard Being Woman of the East, while the sun merely observed the process.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Voth. ''The Traditions of the Hopi'', 1 (Chicago, 1905)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold Courlander explains that this version of the story is an attempt to amalgamate two conflicting Hopi traditions dealing with two female deities, Spider Grandmother and Huruing Wuhti (Hard Being Woman).  Spider Grandmother has a central role or myth where the Hopi arrive in the Fourth World via the [[sipapu]], whereas Hard Being Woman is related to Hopi legends that they arrived in the Fourth World by boat. ''The Fourth World of the Hopi'', 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Masauwu, Skeleton Man, was the Spirit of Death, Earth God, door keeper to the Fifth World, and the Keeper of Fire. He was also the Master of the Upper World, or the Fourth World, and was there when the good people escaped the wickedness of the Third World for the promise of the Fourth.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Coulander. The Fourth World of the Hopis, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;   Masauwu is described as wearing a hideous mask, but again showing the diversity of myths among the Hopi,  Masauwu was alternately described as a handsome, bejewelled man beneath his mask or as a bloody, fearsome creature.  He is also assigned certain benevolent attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton A. Tyler.  ''Pueblo Gods and Myths'', 5-7 (University of Oklahoma Press, 1964)&lt;/ref&gt; One story has it that it was  Masauwu who helped settle the Hopi at [[Oraibi]] and gave them stewardship over the land. He also charged them to watch for the coming of the Pahana (see section below), the Lost White Brother.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Kotchongva.  ''Where is the White Brother of the Hopi Indian?'', ''in'' Improvement Era (1936).&lt;/ref&gt;  Other important deities include the twin war gods, the [[kachinas]], and the trickster, Coyote.

[[Maize]] is vital to Hopi subsistence and religion.  "For traditional Hopis, [[Maize|corn]] is the central bond. Its essence, physically, spiritually, and symbolically, pervades their existence. For the people of the mesas corn is sustenance, ceremonial object, prayer offering, symbol, and sentient being unto itself. Corn is the Mother in the truest sense that people take in the corn and the corn becomes their flesh, as mother milk becomes the flesh of the child."&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Wall and Virgil Masayesva, "People of the Corn: Teachings in Hopi Traditional Agriculture, Spirituality, and Sustainability", ''American Indian Quarterly'', Summer/Fall 2004, pages 435–453.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four Worlds==
Hopi legend tells that the current earth is the Fourth World to be inhabited by Tawa's creations. The story states that in each previous world, the people, though originally happy, became disobedient and lived contrary to Tawa's plan. They engaged in sexual promiscuity, fought one another, and would not live in harmony. The most obedient were delivered (usually by Spider Woman) to the next higher world, with physical changes occurring both in the people in the course of their journey, and in the environment of the next world. In some stories, the former world was then destroyed along with their wicked inhabitants, whereas in others the good people were simply led away from the chaos which had been created by their actions.

===Entrance into the Fourth World===
[[File:Hopi petroglyph - Mesa Verde National Park.jpeg|thumb|A Hopi [[petroglyph]] in [[Mesa Verde National Park]]. The boxy spiral shape near the center of the photo likely represents the "sipapu", the place where the Hopi emerged from the earth in their creation story.]]

Two main versions exist as to the Hopi's emergence into the present Fourth World. The more prevalent is that Spider Grandmother caused a hollow reed (or bamboo) to grow into the sky, and it emerged in the Fourth World at the sipapu.  The people then climbed up the reed into this world, emerging from the sipapu. The location of the sipapu is given as in the [[Grand Canyon]].

The other version (mainly told in Oraibi) has it that Tawa destroyed the Third World in a great flood. Before the destruction, Spider Grandmother sealed the more righteous people into hollow reeds which were used as boats. On arrival on a small piece of dry land, the people saw nothing around them but more water, even after planting a large bamboo shoot, climbing to the top, and looking about. Spider Woman then told the people to make boats out of more reeds, and using island "stepping-stones" along the way, the people sailed east until they arrived on the mountainous coasts of the Fourth World.

While it may not be possible to positively ascertain which is the original or "more correct" story, Harold Courlander writes, at least in [[Oraibi]] (the oldest of the Hopi villages), little children are often told the story of the ''sipapu'', and the story of an ocean voyage is related to them when they are older.&lt;ref name=Courlander&gt;Harold Courlander. ''The Fourth World of the Hopis'', p.205.&lt;/ref&gt; He states that even the name of the Hopi Water Clan (Patkinyamu) literally means "a dwelling-on-water" or "houseboat".  However, he notes the ''sipapu'' story is centered on [[Walpi]] and is more accepted among Hopis generally.&lt;ref name=Courlander/&gt;

===Migrations===
Upon their arrival in the Fourth World, the Hopis divided and went on a series of great migrations throughout the land. Sometimes they would stop and build a town, then abandon it to continue on with the migration. They would leave their symbols behind on the rocks to show that Hopi had been there. Long the divided people wandered in groups of families, eventually forming clans named after an event or sign that a particular group received upon its journey.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'' Harold Courlander.  ''The Fourth World of the Hopi'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  These clans would travel for some time as a unified community, but almost inevitably a disagreement would occur, the clan would split and each portion would go its separate way. However, as the clans traveled, they would often join together forming large groups, only to have these associations disband, and then be reformed with other clans. These alternate periods of harmonious living followed by wickedness, contention, and separation play an important part of the Hopi mythos. This pattern seemingly began in the First World and continues even into recent history.

In the course of their migration, each Hopi clan was to go to the farthest extremity of the land in every direction. Far in the north was a land of snow and ice which was called the "Back Door", but this was closed to the Hopi. However, the Hopi say that other peoples came through the Back Door into the Fourth World. "Back Door" could refer to the [[Bering land bridge]], which connected Asia with North America. The Hopi were led on their migrations by various signs, or were helped along by Spider Woman. Eventually, the Hopi clans finished their prescribed migrations and were led to their current location in northeastern Arizona.

Most Hopi traditions have it that they were given their land by  Masauwu, the Spirit of Death and Master of the Fourth World.

===Sacred Hopi tablets===
Hopi tradition tells of sacred tablets which were imparted to the Hopi by various deities. Like most of Hopi mythology, accounts differ as to when the tablets were given and in precisely what manner.

Perhaps the most important was said to be in the possession of the Fire Clan, and is related to the return of the Pahana. In one version, an elder of the Fire Clan worried that his people would not recognize the Pahana when he returned from the east. He therefore etched various designs including a human figure into a stone, and then broke off the section of the stone which included the figure's head. This section was given to Pahana and he was told to bring it back with him so that the Hopi would not be deceived by a witch or sorcerer.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Courlander, ''The Fourth World of the Hopi'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt; This one is Truth, the stone has an Indian face of black, white and grey with black feathers, and it is not etched but looks more like ink that soaked into the stone.

==Kachinas==
[[Image:Kachina dolls.jpg|thumb|240px|Drawings of kachina dolls from an 1894 anthropology book.]]

Around  1325 CE [[Kachina]] masks and Kachina dancers appear as rock art.&lt;ref name="Layton"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Layton|authorlink1=Robert Hugh Layton|editor1-last=McDonald|editor1-first=Jo|editor2-last=Veth|editor2-first=Peter|title=A Companion to Rock Art|date=2012|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1444334241|page=448|url=https://books.google.com/?id=excwzC1zhY0C&amp;pg=PT641&amp;dq=kachina+1325#v=onepage&amp;q=kachina%201325&amp;f=false|chapter=Rock art, identity and indigeneity}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it remains an open question among scholars as to whether the kachina religion was an indigenous creation, or an import from Mexico. The similarity of many aspects of Hopi religion to that of the [[Aztecs]] to the south strongly suggest the latter to many scholars.{{cn|date=February 2016}}  Raymond Friday Locke discusses the Hopi legend of the Pahana writing that "The Hopis...had long anticipated the coming of Pahana and, either by coincidence or because of a common root of the legends, Pahana was due to visit the Hopi in the very same year that Quetzalcoatl was expected to return to the Aztecs. He arrived some twenty-one years later in the person of the Spaniard [[Pedro de Tovar]], one of Coronado's [[conquistador]]s, and was the first white man to be seen by the Hopis and very probably the Navajo. Unlike the Aztecs, the Hopis put this Spanish Pahana to a series of tests, and when he failed them they sent him on his way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Locke|first1=Raymond Friday|title=The Book of the Navajo|date=2002|publisher=Mankind Publishing Company|isbn=978-0876875001|page=140|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z8e2mfFJa-4C&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=Pahana+Quetzalcoatl#v=onepage&amp;q=Pahana%20Quetzalcoatl&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the Hopi, kachinas are supernatural beings who represent and have charge over various aspects of the natural world. They might be thought of as analogous to Greco-Roman [[demi-god]]s or Catholic [[saints]]. There are literally hundreds of different kachinas, which may represent anything from rain to watermelon, various animals, stars, and even other Indian tribes. However, the kachinas are also thought to be the spirits of dead ancestors, and they may come to the Hopi mesas in the form of rain clouds.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

The Hopi say that during a great drought, they heard singing and dancing coming from the [[San Francisco Peaks]]. Upon investigation, they met the Kachinas who returned with the Hopi to their villages and taught them various forms of agriculture. The Hopi believe that for six months of the year, Kachina spirits live in the Hopi villages. After the Home Dance in late-July or early-August, the Kachinas return to the San Francisco Peaks for six months.&lt;ref&gt;Pecina, Ron and Pecina, Bob. ''Hopi Kachinas: History, Legends, and Art''. Schiffer Publishing Ltd., 2013. {{ISBN|978-0-7643-4429-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hopi believe that these dances are vital for the continued harmony and balance of the world. It serves the further and vital purpose of bringing rain to the Hopi's parched homeland.

==Pahana==
The true Pahana (or Bahana) is the Lost White Brother of the Hopi. Most versions have it that the Pahana or Elder Brother left for the east at the time that the Hopi entered the Fourth World and began their migrations. However, the Hopi say that he will return again and at his coming the wicked will be destroyed and a new age of peace, the [[Fifth World (Native American mythology)|Fifth World]], will be ushered into the world. As mentioned above, it is said he will bring with him a missing section of a sacred Hopi stone in the possession of the Fire Clan, and that he will come wearing red. Traditionally, Hopis are buried facing east in expectation of the Pahana who will come from that direction.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Coulander. The Fourth World of the Hopis, 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend of the Pahana seems intimately connected with the [[Aztec]] story of [[Quetzalcoatl]], and other legends of Central America.&lt;ref name="Susan E. James 2000"/&gt; This similarity is furthered by the liberal representation of [[Awanyu]] or the Paluliikon, the horned or plumed serpent, in Hopi and other [[Pueblo]]an art. This figure resembles Quetzacoatl, the feathered serpent, of Mexico. In the early 16th century, both the Hopis and the Aztecs believed that the coming of the Spanish [[conquistadors]] was the return of this lost white prophet. Unlike the Aztecs, upon first contact the Hopi put the Spanish through a series of tests in order to determine their divinity, and having failed, the Spanish were sent away from the Hopi mesas.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Friday Locke.  ''The Book of the Navajo'', 139-140 (Hollaway House 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

One account has it that the Hopi realized that the Spanish were not the Pahana based upon the destruction of a Hopi town by the Spanish. Thus when the Spanish arrived at the village of [[Awatovi Ruins|Awatovi]], they drew a line of cornmeal as a sign for the Spanish not to enter the village, but this was ignored.  While some Hopi wanted to fight the invaders, it was decided to try a peaceful approach in the hope that the Spanish would eventually leave.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Courlander.  ''The Fourth World of the Hopis'', 176.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Spanish accounts record a short skirmish at [[Awatovi Ruins|Awatovi]] before the Hopis capitulated.

== In popular culture ==
The [[art film]]/[[avant-garde]] [[opera]] ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'' references both the [[Hopi language|Hopi]] term ''Ko.yan.nis.qatsi'' ("life out of balance"), and three Hopi prophecies &amp;mdash;i.e. warnings or [[eschatology]].
* "If we dig precious things from the land, we will invite disaster."
* "Near the day of Purification, there will be cobwebs spun back and forth in the sky."
* "A container of ashes might one day be thrown from the sky, which could burn the land and boil the oceans."

[[David Lanz]] and [[Paul Speer]]'s 1987 [[New-age music|new-age]] album ''Desert Vision'' has a track named "Tawtoma."

The novel by [[Tony Hillerman]], ''[[The Dark Wind]]'', first published in 1982, discusses Hopi mythology throughout the story, as key characters are Hopi men, and events of the story occur near important shrines or during an important ceremony. The fictional Navajo sergeant Jim Chee works with fictional Hopi Albert "Cowboy" Dashee, who is a deputy for Coconino County, Arizona, and speaks Hopi and English, translating for Chee on occasion, as well as explaining shrines and ceremonies to him.

In the 2001 novel ''[[American Gods]]'' by [[Neil Gaiman]], Mr. Ibis (an incarnation of the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|ancient Egyptian god]] [[Thoth]]) discusses the reluctance of scientists to accept evidence of [[pre-Columbian]] visitors to the Americas, and refers to the ''sipapu'' story as historical fact: "Heaven knows what'll happen if they ever actually find the Hopi emergence tunnels. That'll shake a few things up, you just wait."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23334">An '''[[interview]]''' in [[qualitative research]] is a [[conversation]] where [[question]]s are asked to elicit information. The ''interviewer'' is usually a professional or paid researcher, sometimes trained, who poses questions to the ''interviewee'', in an alternating series of usually brief questions and answers. They can be contrasted with [[focus group]]s in which an interviewer questions a group of people and observes the resulting conversation between interviewees, or [[survey (human research)|surveys]] which are more anonymous and limit respondents to a range of predetermined answer choices.  In phenomenological or ethnographic research, interviews are used to uncover the meanings of central themes in the life world of the subjects from their own point of view.

==Characteristics of qualitative research interviews==

* Interviews are completed by the interview based on what the interviewee says to be conformed and done.
* Interviews are a far more personal form of research than questionnaires.
* In the personal interview, the interviewer works directly with the interviewee.
* Unlike with mail surveys, the interviewer has the opportunity to probe or ask follow up questions.
* Interviews are generally easier for the interviewee, especially if what is sought are opinions and/or impressions.
* Interviews are time consuming and resource intensive.
* The interviewer is considered a part of the measurement instrument and has to be well trained in how to respond to any contingency.
*Interviews provide an opportunity of face to face interaction between 2 persons; hence, they reduce conflicts.

==Technique==

When choosing to interview as a method for conducting qualitative research, it is important to be tactful and sensitive in your approach. Interviewer and researcher, Irving Seidman, devotes an entire chapter of his book, Interviewing as Qualitative Research, to the import of proper interviewing technique and interviewer etiquette. Some of the fundamentals of his technique are summarized below:

Listening: According to Seidman, this is both the hardest as well as the most important skill in interviewing. Furthermore, interviewers must be prepared to listen on three different levels: they must listen to what the participant is actually saying, they must listen to the “inner voice”&lt;ref name="Seidman_a"&gt;Seidman, I (1998). Technique isn’t everything, but it is a lot. In Interviewing as qualitative research: A guide for researchers in education and the social sciences. New York, NY: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or subtext of what the participant is communicating, and they must also listen to the process and flow of the interview so as to remain aware of how tired or bored the participant is as well as logistics such as how much time has already passed and how many questions still remain.&lt;ref name="Seidman_a" /&gt;
The listening skills required in an interview require more focus and attention to detail than what is typical in normal conversation. Therefore, it is often helpful for interviewers to take notes while the participant responds to questions or to tape-record the interviews themselves to as to be able to more accurately transcribe them later.&lt;ref name="Seidman_a" /&gt;

Ask questions (to follow up and to clarify): While an interviewer generally enters each interview with a predetermined, standardized set of questions, it is important that they also ask follow-up questions throughout the process. Such questions might encourage a participant to elaborate upon something poignant that they’ve shared and are important in acquiring a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Additionally, it is important that an interviewer ask clarifying questions when they are confused. If the narrative, details, or chronology of a participant’s responses become unclear, it is often appropriate for the interviewer to ask them to re-explain these aspects of their story so as to keep their transcriptions accurate.&lt;ref name="Seidman_a" /&gt;

Be respectful of boundaries: Seidman explains this tactic as “Explore, don’t probe,”&lt;ref name="Seidman_a" /&gt; It is essential that while the participant is being interviewed they are being encouraged to explore their experiences in a manner that is sensitive and respectful. They should not be “probed” in such a way that makes them feel uncomfortable or like a specimen in lab. If too much time is spent dwelling on minute details or if too many follow-up questions are asked, it is possible that the participant will become defensive or unwilling to share. Thus, it is the interviewer’s job to strike a balance between ambiguity and specificity in their question asking.&lt;ref name="Seidman_a" /&gt;

Be wary of leading questions: Leading questions are questions which suggest or imply an answer. While they are often asked innocently they run the risk of altering the validity of the responses obtained as they discourage participants from using their own language to express their sentiments. Thus it is preferable that interviewers ask open-ended questions instead. For example, instead of asking “Did the experience make you feel sad?” - which is leading in nature - it would be better to ask “How did the experience make you feel” - as this suggests no expectation.&lt;ref name="Seidman_a" /&gt;

Don’t interrupt: Participants should feel comfortable and respected throughout the entire interview - thus interviewers should avoid interrupting participants whenever possible. While participants may digress in their responses and while the interviewer may lose interest in what they are saying at one point or another it is critical that they be tactful in their efforts to keep the participant on track and to return to the subject matter in question.&lt;ref name="Seidman_a" /&gt;

Make the participant feel comfortable: Interviewing proposes an unusual dynamic in that it often requires the participant to divulge personal or emotional information in the presence of a complete stranger. Thus, many interviewers find it helpful to ask the participant to address them as if they were “someone else,”&lt;ref name="Seidman_a" /&gt; such as a close friend or family member. This is often an effective method for tuning into the aforementioned “inner voice”&lt;ref name="Seidman_a" /&gt; of the participant and breaking down the more presentational barriers of the guarded “outer voice” which often prevails.&lt;ref name="Seidman_a" /&gt;

==Strengths and weaknesses==

There are many methods. When considering what type of qualitative research method to use, Qualitative Interviewing has many advantages. Possibly the greatest advantage of Qualitative interviewing is the depth of detail from the interviewee. Interviewing participants can paint a picture of what happened in a specific event, tell us their perspective of such event, as well as give other social cues. Social cues, such as voice, intonation, body language etc. of the interviewee can give the interviewer a lot of extra information that can be added to the verbal answer of the interviewee on a question. This level of detailed description, whether it be verbal or nonverbal, can show an otherwise hidden interrelatedness between emotions, people, objects unlike many quantitative methods of research.&lt;ref name="Weiss"&gt;Weiss, R. S. (1994). Learning from strangers, the art and method of qualitative interview studies. New York, NY: Free Pr.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, qualitative interviewing has a unique advantage in its specific form. Researchers can tailor the questions they ask to the respondent in order to get rich, full stories and the information they need for their project. They can make it clear to the respondent when they need more examples or explanations.&lt;ref&gt;Emans, Ben (1986). Interviewen; theorie, techniek en training. Groningen: Wolters-Noordhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only can researchers also learn about specific events, they can also gain insight into people’s interior experiences, specifically how people perceive and how they interpreted their perceptions. How events affected their thoughts and feelings. In this, researchers can understand the process of an event instead of what just happened and how they reacted to it.

Another advantage of qualitative interviewing is what it can give to the readers of academic journals and papers. Research can write a clearer report to their readers, giving them a “fuller understanding of the experiences of our respondents and a greater chance to identify with the respondent, if only briefly.”&lt;ref name="Weiss" /&gt;

Qualitative interviewing is not a perfect method for all types of research. It does have its disadvantages. First, there can be complications with the planning of the interview. Not only is recruiting people for interviews hard, due to the typically personal nature of the interview, planning where to meet them and when can be difficult. Participants can cancel or change the meeting place at the last minute.

During the actual interview, a possible weakness is missing some information. This can arise from the immense multitasking that the interviewer must do. Not only do they have to make the respondent feel very comfortable, they have to keep as much eye contact as possible, write down as much as they can, and think of follow up questions.
After the interview, the process of coding begins and with this comes its own set of disadvantages. First, coding can be extremely time consuming. This process typically requires multiple people, which can also become expensive. Second, the nature of qualitative research itself, doesn’t lend itself very well to quantitative analysis. Some researchers report more missing data in interview research than survey research, therefore it can be difficult to compare populations&lt;ref name="Weiss" /&gt;

==Participant in qualitative research interviews==

Compared to something like a written survey, interviews allow for a significantly higher degree of intimacy,&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, Irving. Interviewing as Qualitative Research: A Guide for Researchers in Education and the Social Sciences. Teachers College Press, 1998, pg.49&lt;/ref&gt; with participants often revealing personal information to their interviewers in a real-time, face-to-face setting. As such, this technique can evoke an array of significant feelings and experiences within those being interviewed.

On the positive end, interviewing can provide participants with an outlet to express themselves. Since the job of interviewers is to learn, not to treat or counsel, they do not offer participants any advice, but nonetheless, telling an attentive listener about concerns and cares can be pleasing. As qualitative researcher Robert S. Weiss puts it, “To talk to someone who listens, and listens closely, can be valuable, because one’s own experience, through the process of being voiced and shared, is validated.”&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Robert. Learning from Strangers: The Art and Method of Qualitative Interview Studies. The Free Press, 1994, pg. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Such validation, however, can have a downside if a participant feels let down upon termination of the interview relationship,&lt;ref name="Learning from Strangers, pg. 123" /&gt; for, unlike with figures like therapists or counselors, interviewers do not take a measure of ongoing responsibility for the participant, and their relationship is not continuous.&lt;ref name="SeidmanIrving"&gt;Seidman, Irving. Interviewing as Qualitative Research: A Guide for Researchers in Education and the Social Sciences. Teachers College Press, 1998, pg.91&lt;/ref&gt; To minimize the potential for this disappointment, researchers should tell participants how many interviews they will be conducting in advance, and also provide them with some type of closure, such as a research summary or a copy of the project publication.&lt;ref name="Learning from Strangers, pg. 123"&gt;Weiss, Robert. Learning from Strangers: The Art and Method of Qualitative Interview Studies. The Free Press, 1994, pg. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

On the negative end, the multiple-question based nature of interviews can lead participants to feel uncomfortable and intruded upon if an interviewer encroaches on territory that they feel is too personal or private. To avoid crossing this line, researchers should attempt to distinguish between public information and private information, and only delve deeper into private information after trying to gauge a participant’s comfort level in discussing it.&lt;ref name="SeidmanIrving" /&gt;

Furthermore, the comparatively intimate nature of interviews can make participants feel vulnerable to harm or exploitation.&lt;ref name="SeidmanIrving_a"&gt;Seidman, Irving. Interviewing as Qualitative Research: A Guide for Researchers in Education and the Social Sciences. Teachers College Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; This can be especially true for situations in which a superior interviews a subordinate, like when teacher interviewers his or her student. In these situations, participants may be fearful of providing a “wrong answer,” or saying something that could potentially get them into trouble and reflect on them negatively.&lt;ref name="SeidmanIrving_a" /&gt; However, all interview relationships, not just explicitly superior-subordinate ones, are marked by some degree of inequality, as interviewers and participants want and receive different things from the technique.&lt;ref name="SeidmanIrving_a" /&gt; Thus, researchers should always be concerned with the potential for participant feelings of vulnerability, especially in situations where personal information is revealed.

In order to combat such feelings of vulnerability and inequity and to make participants feel safe, equal, and respected, researchers should provide them with information about the study, such as who is running it and what potential risks it might entail, and also with information about their rights, such as the right to review interview materials and withdraw from the process at any time. It is especially important that researchers always emphasize the voluntary nature of participating in a study so that the participants remain aware of their agency.&lt;ref name="SeidmanIrving_a" /&gt;

These aforementioned power dynamics present in interviews can also have specific effects on different social groups according to racial background, gender, age, and class. Race, for example, can pose issues in an interview setting if participants of a marginalized racial background are interviewed by white researchers,&lt;ref name="SeidmanIrving_a" /&gt; in which case the existence of historical and societal prejudices can evoke a sense of skepticism and distrust.&lt;ref name="SeidmanIrving_a" /&gt; Gender dynamics can similarly affect feelings, with men sometimes acting overbearingly when interviewing women and acting dismissively when being interviewed by women, and same-gendered pairs being vulnerable to false assumptions of commonality or a sense of implicit competition.&lt;ref name="SeidmanIrving_a" /&gt; In terms of class, participants of perceived lower status demonstrate, in some cases, either excessive skepticism or excessive submissiveness, and in terms of age, children and seniors may exhibit fears of being patronized.&lt;ref name="SeidmanIrving_a" /&gt; In order to minimize these social group related negative feelings, researchers should remain sensitive to possible sources of such tensions, and act accordingly by emphasizing good manners, respect, and a genuine interest in the participant, all of which can all help bridge social barriers.&lt;ref name="SeidmanIrving_a" /&gt;

Finally, another aspect of interviews that can affect how a participant feels is how the interviewer expresses his or her own feelings, for interviewers can project their moods and emotions onto those they are interviewing. For instance, if an interviewer feels noticeably uncomfortable, the participant may begin to share this discomfort,&lt;ref name="SeidmanIrving_a" /&gt; and if an interviewer expresses anger, he or she is in danger of passing it on to the participant. So, researchers should try to remain calm, polite, and interested at all times.

==Types==

; Informal, Conversational interview: No predetermined questions are asked, in order to remain as open and adaptable as possible to the interviewee's nature and priorities; during the interview the interviewer "goes with the flow".
; General interview guide approach: Intended to ensure that the same general areas of information are collected from each interviewee; this provides more focus than the conversational approach, but still allows a degree of freedom and adaptability in getting the information from the interviewee.
; Standardized, open-ended interview: The same open-ended questions are asked to all interviewees; this approach facilitates faster interviews that can be more easily analyzed and compared.
; Closed, fixed-response interview: All interviewees are asked the same questions and asked to choose answers from among the same set of alternatives. This format is useful for those not practiced in interviewing. This type of interview is also referred to as structured.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Brenda (2014). "In-Depth Interviewing" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=ENDpAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23 ''Routledge Handbook of Research Methods in Military Studies''], (eds.) J. Sorters, P. Shields, S Henriette. New York: Routledge. 115-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Household research==

Research on [[household]]s pose specific ethical problems of [[anonymity]] and [[consent]] among interviewees, and there is an ongoing controversy over whether [[spouse]]s should be interviewed in personal, individual interviews or in [[couple interview]]s.&lt;ref name="B-F-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bjørnholt |first1=M |last2= Farstad |first2= G.R. |year= 2012|title='Am I rambling?' On the advantages of interviewing couples together |journal=[[Qualitative Research]] |volume=14|issue=1 |pages=3–19|publisher= |doi= 10.1177/1468794112459671 |url=http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Am_I_rambling_on_the_advantages_of_interviewing_couples_together.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interviewer's judgements==

According to Hackman and Oldman several factors can bias an interviewer's judgment about a job applicant. However these factors can be reduced or minimized by training interviews to recognized them.

Some examples are:::

;Prior Information: Interviewers generally have some prior information about job candidates, such as recruiter evaluations, application blanks, online screening results, or the results of psychological tests. This can cause the interviewer to have a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward an applicant before meeting them.

;The Contrast Effect: How the interviewers evaluate a particular applicant may depend on their standards of comparison, that is, the characteristics of the applicants they interviewed previously.

;Interviewers' Prejudices: This can be done when the interviewers' judgement is their personal likes and dislikes. These may include but are not limited to racial and ethnic background, applicants who display certain qualities or traits and refuse to consider their abilities or characteristics.

==Stages of interview investigation==
* Thematizing, the why and what of the investigation
* Designing, plan the design of the study
* Interviewing, conduct the interview based on a guide
* Transcribing, prepare the interview material for analysis
* Analyzing, decide on the purpose, the topic, the nature and methods of analysis that are appropriate
* Verifying, ascertain the validity of the interview findings
* Reporting, communicate findings of the study based on academic criteria

In 1996, Lent founded [[NextCard]], an internet [[financial services]] company. NextCard was the first company to enable consumers to apply for a credit card over the internet and be approved in real time and the first company to offer consumers the ability to design their own card by uploading a personalized image during the application process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As chairman and CEO, Lent took NextCard public in 1999 and led a secondary offering in 2000. However, due to his first wife’s illness, Lent stepped down as CEO later in 2000, to care for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/1012883/1/nextcard-mixes-good-news-quicker-profitability-with-bad-ceos-departure.html|title=NextCard Mixes Good News, Quicker Profitability, With Bad, CEO's Departure|last=Eavis|first=Peter|date=2000-07-24|work=TheStreet|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Lent’s departure, NextCard suffered serious setbacks. It was announced in late 2001, that the company was undercapitalized, and it was taken over by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) in 2002.  Along with the other board members, Lent was involved for several years in shareholder lawsuits and investigations by the FDIC and [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC). These were eventually settled, and in 2005 the SEC dismissed fraud charges that it had levied against Lent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19903.htm|title=Jeremy R.

== Writing ==

=== ''The Patterning Instinct'' ===
''The Patterning Instinct: A Cultural History of Humanity’s Search for Meaning'' ([[Prometheus Books]], May 2017) is a cognitive history of humanity, tracing how different cultures patterned meaning into the universe and how that has affected history. The result of ten years of research, the book offers a thesis that “culture shapes values and those values shape history.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This approach is in contrast to the predominant [[Geographic determinism|geographic determinist]] approach to history, exemplified by historians such as [[Jared Diamond]], [[Ian Morris (historian)|Ian Morris]] and [[Kenneth Pomeranz]]. Lent argues that “The cognitive frames through which different cultures perceive reality have had a profound effect on their historical direction. The worldview of a given civilization—the implicit beliefs and values that create a pattern of meaning in people’s lives—has, in my opinion, been a significant driver of the historical path each civilization has taken.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lent|first=Jeremy|date=|title=Patterning Instinct|url=|journal=Origins: The Bulletin of the International Big History Association|volume=VI|pages=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book conducts what Lent calls an “archaeological exploration of the mind,” using findings from [[cognitive science]] and [[systems theory]] to reveal the implicit layers of values that form cultural norms. In a departure from the mainstream science-religion debate, ''The Patterning Instinct'' shows how medieval Christian rationalism acted as an incubator for scientific thought, which in turn, shaped the modern vision of the “conquest of nature.” Evaluating the sustainability crisis, Lent argues that it is culturally driven: a product of particular patterns that could be reshaped.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edelweiss.abovethetreeline.com/ProductDetailPage.aspx?sequence=18&amp;group=catalog&amp;mailingID=0&amp;mailingGroupID=0&amp;catalogID=4016922&amp;org=&amp;sku=1633882934|title=The Patterning Instinct|website=edelweiss.abovethetreeline.com|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book concludes by exploring scenarios for humanity’s future, foreseeing a coming struggle between two contrasting views: one driving to a technological world of artificially enhanced humans, the other enabling a sustainable future arising from intrinsic connectedness among people and to the natural world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''The Patterning Instinct'' contains a foreword by [[Fritjof Capra]]. Prior to publication, the book received favorable endorsements from notables such as [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich,]] [[Thom Hartmann]], Rick Hanson, [[J. R. McNeill]], and [[Jonathon Porritt]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Guardian journalist, George Monbiot, has called it "the most profound and far-reaching book I have ever read."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2018/01/31/stepping-back-from-the-brink/|title=Stepping Back from the Brink|work=George Monbiot|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book received a Silver Award from [http://nautilusbookawards.com/2017-silver-winners/ Nautilus Book Awards] in April, 2018 in the Social Sciences &amp; Education category.

=== ''Requiem of the Human Soul'' ===
Beginning around 2005, Lent began an inquiry into the various constructions of meaning formed by cultures around the world and throughout history. The first expression of this investigation was his science fiction novel, ''Requiem of the Human Soul'' (Libros Libertad, 2009)..

The novel is set in the late 22nd century when most people are genetically enhanced. The minority that remains genetically unadulterated, known as Primals, consists mostly of the impoverished global underclass. The UN is holding a hearing in New York to consider whether to make the Primals extinct. The novel is written from the viewpoint of a Primal, Eusebio, who has been picked to represent his race in a last-ditch legal effort to save the Primals from extinction.

The novel raises questions about spirituality, history and global politics: Can the human race enhance itself to a higher plane? At what cost and benefit? If some “essence” of humanity was lost as a result, would that be so bad, given our sordid and shameful history? On the other hand, is there something special—a human soul—worth keeping at any price? Ultimately, the novel invites the reader to grapple with a fundamental question: what does it mean to be human?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Requiem of the Human Soul|last=Lent|first=Jeremy|publisher=Libros Libertad|year=2009|isbn=|location=Vancouver|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liology Institute ==
Lent founded the nonprofit Liology Institute in 2012, with the aim of fostering a worldview that could enable humanity to thrive sustainably. The institute, according to its website, “is dedicated to fostering a worldview in which the human discovery and experience of meaning in our lives is compatible with the findings of scientific investigation, offering a deeply integrated and coherent understanding of humanity’s place in our cosmos which could enable us to thrive on our planet harmoniously and sustainably.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liology.org/|title=The Liology Institute|website=The Liology Institute|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lent coined the term "liology" from the Chinese word ''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|li]],'' meaning organizing principles of the universe, and “ology” of Greek etymology meaning “the study of.” The institute is intended to integrate traditional East Asian practices with the findings of modern systems science.

Its stated objectives are to:
* Stimulate and encourage a deep integration of scientific rigor with spiritual meaning.
* Distill East Asian spiritual traditions and integrate them with findings in systems biology, complexity science and neuroscience.
* Replace the mind/body duality of conventional Western thought with a concept that value is intrinsic to our experience.
* Join the worldwide movement towards achieving a sustainable way of living.
* Adopt an interdisciplinary approach to understanding humanity's history, current condition and trajectory.
* Cultivate skills that promote integration within a person and harmonization between humanity and the natural world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
In 2014, the institute began an annual series of workshops, exploring how the values and insights of Liology apply to people’s everyday lives.

== Great Transformation ==
Lent asserts that humanity is entering a period of transformation, of a scale that has occurred twice before in history: the [[First agricultural revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] twelve thousand years ago, and the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific]] and [[Industrial Revolution]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s several hundred years ago. The trajectories he consider include a [[collapse of civilization]], a [[Posthumanism|posthuman]] techno society and sustainable human flourishing (a "Great Transformation").

Lent claims that, to secure the latter humanity needs a new suite of values based on a sense of intrinsic connectedness. These values emphasize:
* Quality of life, rather than material possessions
* Political, social, and economic choices based on shared humanity
* Environmentally sustainable societies.&lt;ref&gt;“The Great Transformation, Or How We (Just) Avoided a Climate Catastrophe: A historian in 2050 looks back at the first half of the century.” Presented at the UC Santa Barbara virtual conference: ''The World In 2050: Creating/Imagining Just Climate Futures.'' October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José Hermano Baptista Saraiva''' &lt;small&gt;[[Order of Prince Henry|GCIH]]&lt;/small&gt; • &lt;small&gt;[[Order of Public Instruction (Portugal)|GCIP]]&lt;/small&gt; (3 October 1919 – 20 July 2012) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[professor]], [[historian]] and [[jurist]]. He was most known as a television personality in Portugal, having been the author and presenter of several documentary series of historical divulgation in the last decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sol.sapo.pt/inicio/Cultura/Interior.aspx?content_id=1907 |title=José Hermano Saraiva reconhecido pela Academia como 'grande divulgador' da História|trans-title=José Hermano Saraiva acknowledged by the Academy as History's 'great spokesperson'|publisher=Sol|language=Portuguese|date=11 October 2010|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Hermano Saraiva was a professor of [[law]] and [[business]] [[management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waatp.com/gate/index.html?to=http%253A%252F%252Fcolipoleiria.blogspot.com%252F2010%252F09%252Fjose-hermano-saraiva.html&amp;people_id=49445720|title=José Hermano Saraiva|trans-title=José Hermano Saraiva|publisher=WAATP|language=Portuguese|date=11 October 2010|accessdate=23 March 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Education minister|Minister of Education]] of Portugal between 1968 and 1970 and [[ambassador]] to [[Brazil]] between 1972 and 1974. He lectured in the'' [[Instituto Superior de Ciências Sociais e Políticas|Instituto Superior de Ciências Sociais e Política Ultramarina]]'' at the ''[[Universidade Técnica de Lisboa]]'', and in private teaching institutes.

Saraiva is most famous in Portugal, but also among Portuguese communities around the world, on account of his television programs on the [[History of Portugal]], broadcast by [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal|RTP]]. He was a member of the [[Sciences Academy of Lisbon]], [[Academia Portuguesa da História|Portuguese Academy of History]] and [[Instituto Histórico de São Paulo|São Paulo Historical Institute]] in Brazil.

Hermano Saraiva was distinguished with the ''Grã-Cruz of the Order of Public Instruction'', ''Grã-Cruz of the Order of Prince Henry'', the ''Grã-Cruz of the Order of Barão do Rio Branco'' of [[Brazil]], the ''Grã-Cruz of the Ordem do Mérito do Trabalho'' and the ''Comendador da Real Ordem de Nossa Senhora da Conceição de Vila Viçosa''.

His supporters point out his qualities as a television communicator and of spreader of the History of Portugal to the least instructed people in the country and to the Portuguese communities outside Portugal.

==Personal life==
Hermano Saraiva was born in [[Leiria]], the third of the six sons of José Leonardo Venâncio Saraiva (born 1 April 1881, erudite and well known professor, Mayor of Leiria and Head Master of Liceu Passos Manuel in [[Lisbon]]) and wife Maria da Ressurreição Baptista Saraiva. Amongst his siblings is [[:pt:António José Saraiva|António José Saraiva]], a known investigator in the area of [[literature]], and his [[Nephew and niece|nephew]] [[:pt:José António Saraiva|José António Saraiva]] worked as a [[journalist]] and [[architect]]. One of his maternal [[uncle]]s was the last living Portuguese veteran of the [[World War I|First World War]].

Saraiva married Maria de Lourdes de Bettencourt de Sá Nogueira (born 16 May 1918), daughter of Rodrigo de Sá Nogueira (born 3 December 1892, a [[college]] [[professor]] and great-nephew of [[Bernardo de Sá Nogueira de Figueiredo, 1st Marquess of Sá da Bandeira]]) and wife Maria Luísa Rodrigues de Bettencourt (married 20 November 1915), fathering five children.

Saraiva died, aged 92, in [[Setúbal]].

The '''Lamta Archaeological Museum''' is an [[archaeological museum]] located in [[Lamta]], [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref name="web"&gt;[http://www.patrimoinedetunisie.com.tn/eng/musees/lamta.php Lamta Archaeological Museum], Republic of Tunisia's Ministry of Culture, accessed December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The museum started in 1992 and its principal role is to explain the history of the area which starts in the 13th century b.c.e. with the start attributed to [[Phoenicia]]n sailors. The [[Punics|Punic]] funeral remains inside the museum illustrate the changes in culture and the methods of manufacture.&lt;ref name="web"/&gt;

The settlement chose wisely during the Roman period aligning itself militarily with Rome and when that was split it chose to back the winner, [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref name="web"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7943">A '''lunisolar calendar''' is a [[calendar]] in many [[culture]]s whose date indicates both the [[moon phase]] and the time of the solar [[year]]. If the solar year is defined as a [[tropical year]], then a lunisolar calendar will give an indication of the [[season]]; if it is taken as a [[sidereal year]], then the calendar will predict the [[constellation]] near which the [[full moon]] may occur. As with all calendars which divide the year into months there is an additional requirement that the year have a whole number of months. In this case ordinary years consist of twelve months but every second or third year is an [[embolismic month|embolismic year]], which adds a thirteenth [[Intercalation (timekeeping) | intercalary]], embolismic, or leap month.

==Examples==
The [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew]], [[Jain calendar|Jain]], [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist]], [[Hindu calendar|Hindu]] and [[Kurdish calendar|Kurdish]] as well as the traditional  [[ Burmese calendar|Burmese]], [[Chinese calendar|Chinese]], [[Japanese calendar|Japanese]], [[Tibetan calendar|Tibetan]], [[Vietnamese calendar|Vietnamese]], [[Mongolian calendar|Mongolian]] and [[Korean calendar|Korean]] calendars (in the [[east Asian cultural sphere]]), plus the ancient [[Hellenic calendars|Hellenic]], [[Coligny calendar|Coligny]], and [[Babylonian calendar]]s are all lunisolar. Also, some of the ancient [[Islamic calendar#Pre-Islamic calendar|pre-Islamic]] calendars in [[south Arabia]] followed a lunisolar system.&lt;ref name="EI2-Tarikh"&gt;F.C. De Blois, "TAʾRĪKH": I.1.iv. "Pre-Islamic and agricultural calendars of the Arabian peninsula", ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'', 2nd edition, '''X''':260.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese, Coligny and
Hebrew&lt;ref&gt;The modern Hebrew calendar, since it is based on rules rather than observations, does not exactly track the tropical year, and in fact the average Hebrew year of ~365.2468 days is intermediate between the tropical year (~365.2422 days) and the sidereal year (~365.2564 days).
&lt;/ref&gt; lunisolar calendars track more or less the tropical year whereas the Buddhist and Hindu lunisolar calendars track the sidereal year. Therefore, the first three give an idea of the seasons whereas the last two give an idea of the position among the constellations of the full moon. The Tibetan calendar was influenced by both the Chinese and Buddhist calendars. The [[Germanic calendar|Germanic peoples also used a lunisolar calendar]] before their conversion to Christianity.

The [[Islamic calendar]] is [[lunar calendar|lunar]], but not a lunisolar calendar because its date is not related to the sun.  The civil versions of the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s are [[solar calendar|solar]], because their dates do not indicate the moon phase &amp;mdash; however, both the Gregorian and Julian calendars include undated lunar calendars that allow them to [[Computus|calculate]] the Christian celebration of [[Easter]], so both are lunisolar calendars in that respect.

== Determining leap months ==

A rough idea of the frequency of the intercalary or leap month in all lunisolar calendars can be obtained by the following calculation, using approximate lengths of months and years in days:
*Year: 365.25, Month: 29.53
*365.25/(12 × 29.53) = 1.0307
*1/0.0307 = 32.57 common months between leap months
*32.57/12 = 2.7 common years between leap years

Intercalation of leap months is frequently controlled by the "epact", which is the difference between the lunar and solar years (approximately 11 days). The Metonic cycle, used in the Hebrew calendar and the Julian and Gregorian ecclesiastical calendars, adds seven months during every nineteen year period. The classic [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] cycle can be reproduced by assigning an initial epact value of 1 to the last year of the cycle and incrementing by 11 each year. Between the last year of one cycle and the first year of the next the increment is 12. This adjustment, the ''saltus lunae'', causes the epacts to repeat every 19 years. When the epact goes above 29 an intercalary month is added and 30 is subtracted. The intercalary years are numbers 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 19. Both the Hebrew calendar and the Julian calendar use this sequence.

The  Buddhist and Hebrew calendars restrict the leap month to a single month of the year; the number of common months between leap months is, therefore, usually 36, but occasionally only 24 months. Because the Chinese and Hindu lunisolar calendars allow the leap month to occur after or before (respectively) any month but use the true motion of the [[sun]], their leap months do not usually occur within a couple of months of [[perihelion]], when the apparent speed of the sun along the [[ecliptic]] is fastest (now about 3 January). This increases the usual number of common months between leap months to roughly 34 months when a doublet of common years occurs, while reducing the number to about 29 months when only a common singleton occurs.

==With uncounted time==
An alternative way of dealing with the fact that a solar year does not contain an integer number of months is by including uncounted time in the year that does not belong to any month. Some [[Coast Salish peoples]] used a calendar of this kind. For instance, the [[Sts'Ailes|Chehalis]] began their count of lunar months from the arrival of spawning [[chinook salmon]] (in Gregorian calendar October), and counted 10 months, leaving an uncounted period until the next chinook [[salmon run]].&lt;ref&gt;Suttles, Wayne P. ''Musqueam Reference Grammar'', UBC Press, 2004, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gregorian lunisolar calendar==
The Gregorian calendar has a lunisolar calendar, which is used to determine the date of Easter. The rules are in the [[Computus]].

'''Mathias Chardon''' (name in religion Charles) (b. at [[Yvoi-Varignan]], [[Ardennes]], France, 22 September 1695; d. at the [[monastery of St-Arnold in Metz]], 21 October 1771) was a French [[Benedictine]] scholar of the [[Congregation of Saint-Vannes]].

==Life==

He took vows in the [[monastery of St-Vannes]] (St-Viton) in [[Verdun]] in 1712, and became known for his learning. At the general chapter of the Congregation of St-Vannes, held at [[Toul]], in 1730, Chardon was forced to resign his office as a professor because he opposed the Bull ''[[Unigenitus]]''.

==Works==

The "Histoire des Sacraments" (Paris, 1745, 6 vols.) was written against the [[Sacramentarians]]. It is a historical work, showing how the sacraments were administered in the Catholic Church, and how they were used from the time of the Apostles to his days. There is also an Italian translation (Verona, 1754; Brescia, 1758; Capolago, 1835), and it is reprinted in [[Migne]], "Cursus Theologiae" (Paris, 1840), XX, 1-1152.

The '''Mauro-Roman Kingdom''' ([[Latin]]: ''Regnum Maurorum et Romanorum'') was an independent [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Berbers|Berber]] kingdom centered on the city of [[Altava]] which controlled much of the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] province of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]], located in present-day northern [[Algeria]]. The kingdom was first formed in the fifth century as Roman control over the province weakened and Imperial resources had to be concentrated elsewhere, notably in defending the [[Italian Peninsula]] itself from invading germanic tribes.

The rulers of the Mauro-Roman Kingdom would repeatedly come into conflict with the [[Vandals]] of the neighbouring [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandalic Kingdom]], which had been established following the Vandalic conquest of the Roman province of Africa. King [[Masuna]] of the Moors and Romans would ally with the armies of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] during their reconquest of Northern Africa in the [[Vandalic War]]. Following the Eastern Roman victory over the Vandals, the Mauro-Roman Kingdom would maintain its alliance with the Eastern Roman Empire, assisting it in wars against invading Berbers of other tribes and kingdoms, such as the [[Kingdom of the Aures]].

Eventually, the diplomatic ties between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Mauro-Roman Kingdom would break down. King [[Garmul]] of the Moors and Romans would invade the Eastern Roman [[Praetorian prefecture of Africa|Praetorian Prefecture of Africa]] in an attempt at capturing Roman territories. His defeat in 578 AD led almost immediately to the end of the Mauro-Roman Kingdom, which was fragmented and partially reincorporated into the Roman Empire.

The kingdom was succeeded by some smaller romanized Berber successor states, such as the [[Kingdom of Altava]]. These petty kingdoms would last in the [[Maghreb]] until the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|conquest of the region]] by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the seventh and eighth centuries.

==History==
===Background===
[[File:Roman_Empire_-_Mauretania_Caesariensis_(125_AD).svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Roman_Empire_-_Mauretania_Caesariensis_(125_AD).svg|left|thumb|182x182px|The province of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]] within the Roman Empire.]]
[[Mauretania]] and western [[Numidia]], previously a Roman client kingdom, were fully annexed by the Roman Empire in 40 AD and divided into two provinces under Emperor [[Claudius]]; [[Mauretania Tingitana]] ("Tangerine Mauretania") and [[Mauretania Caesariensis]] ("Caesarian Mauretania"), with the separating border designated as [[Moulouya River]].{{sfn|Talbert|2000|p=457}}

Northern Africa was not as well-defended as frontiers that saw frequent attacks, such as those against [[Germania]] and [[Parthian Empire|Persia]], but the economic importance of the African provinces made them important to retain. To this end, defensive structures were constructed alongside their borders, such as the ''[[Fossatum Africae]]''; a 750&amp;nbsp;km long linear defensive structure composed of ditches, stone walls and other fortifications. This structure would be in consistent use until the [[Vandals|Vandal]] conquest of the [[Africa (Roman province)|province of Africa]].{{sfn|Baradez|1949|p=162}} The Mauretanian frontier, not as well defended as that of the African frontier, was known as the ''[[Limes Mauretaniae]]''.{{sfn|Frank|1959|p=68}}

As Roman authority became occupied elsewhere during the disastrous civil wars and disintegrations of the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], local nomadic [[Berbers|Berber]] tribes harassed settlements and occupied some of the border regions of Mauretania Tingitania and Mauretania Caesariensis. The incursions were seen as such a large threat that the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman Emperor]], [[Maximian]], personally became involved in the conflict.{{sfn|Barnes|1981|p=16}} Three Berber tribes, the [[Bavares (Berber tribe)|Bavares]], [[Quinquegentiani]] and [[Fraxinenses]], had formed a confederation. Though the Berbers faced a defeat against a small army raised by the [[Roman governor|governor]] of Mauretania Caesariensis in 289 AD, they soon returned. In 296 AD, Maximian raised an army, from [[Praetorian Guard|Praetorian cohorts]], [[Aquileia]]n, Egyptian, and Danubian legionaries, Gallic and German [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]], and [[Thracian]] recruits, advancing through Spain that autumn.{{sfn|Barnes|1982|p=59}} He may have defended the region against raiding Berbers before crossing the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] into Mauretania Tingitana to protect the area from [[Franks|Frankish]] pirates.{{sfn|Barnes|1981|p=16}}

Maximian began an offensive against the invading tribes in March 297 AD, and pursued them even beyond the borders of the Empire, not content with simply letting them return to their homelands in the [[Atlas Mountains]], from which they would be able to continue to wage war. Though the Berbers were skilled at guerrilla warfare and the terrain was unfavorable, Maximian continued his campaign deep into Berber territory. When the campaign was concluded in 298 AD, Maximian had driven the tribes back into the [[Sahara]], devastated previously secure land and killed as many as he could.{{sfn|Odahl|2004|p=58}}{{sfn|Williams|1997|p=75}} On March 10, he made a triumphal entry into [[Carthage]], with the people hailing him as ''redditor lucis aeternae'' ("restorer of the eternal light").{{sfn|Odahl|2004|p=58}}{{sfn|Williams|1997|p=75}}

=== Establishment ===
The fifth century would see the collapse and fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The inland territories of Mauretania had already been under Berber control since the fourth century, with direct Roman rule confined to coastal cities such as [[Septem (Ceuta)|Septem]] in Mauretania Tingitania and [[Caesarea in Mauretania|Caesarea]] in Mauretania Caesariensis.{{sfn|Wickham|2005|p=18}} The Berber rulers of the inland territories maintained a degree of Roman culture, including the local cities and settlements, and often nominally acknowledged the suzerainty of the Roman Emperors.{{sfn|Wickham|2005|p=335}}

As barbarian incursions became more common even in previously secure provinces such as Italy, the Western Roman military became increasingly occupied to defend territories in the northern parts of the Empire. Even the vital [[Rhine]] frontier against [[Germania]] had been stripped of troops in order to organize a defense against a [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] army invading Italy under [[Alaric I|Alaric]]. The undermanned frontier allowed several tribes, such as the [[Vandals]], [[Alans]] and [[Suebi]], to cross the Rhine in 406 AD and invade Roman territory.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=195}}

As attention was needed elsewhere, central authority began to collapse in many of the more distant provinces. In Mauretania, local Berber leaders and tribes had long been integrated into the imperial system as allies, ''[[foederati]]'' and frontier commanders and as Roman control weakened, they established their own kingdoms and polities in the region. The presence of [[Romanization (cultural)|romanized]] communities along the frontier regions of the provinces meant that the Berber chieftains had some experience in governing populations composed of both Berbers and Romans.{{sfn|Merrills|2017|p=}}

Following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Mauro-Roman Kingdom would grow into a fully fledged [[Barbarian kingdoms|Barbarian kingdom]] not entirely unlike those that had sprung up in other parts of the former Empire. Though most other Barbarian kingdoms, such as those of the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigoths]] and [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]], were fully within the borders of the former Roman Empire, the Mauro-Roman Kingdom extended beyond the formal imperial frontier, also encompassing Berber territories never controlled by the Romans.{{sfn|Merrills|2017|p=}}

=== Kings of the Moors and Romans ===
One of the Berber rulers of Mauretania, [[Masuna]], titled himself as ''Rex gentium Maurorum et Romanorum'', the "King of the Roman and Moorish peoples". Masuna is known only from an inscription on a fortification in [[Altava]] (modern [[Ouled Mimoun]], in the region of [[Oran]]), dated 508 AD. He is known to have possessed Altava, assumed to have been the capital due to its prominence under subsequent kings, and at least two other cities, ''[[Castra Severiana]]'' and ''[[Safar (city)|Safar]]'', as mention is made of officials he appointed there. As the seat of an ecclesiarchal [[diocese]] (the diocese of Castra Severiana, an ancient bishophoric which flourished during Late Antiquity), the control of ''Castra Severiana'' may have been particularly important.{{sfn|Morcelli|1816|p=130}}
: In full, the inscription reads: ''"Pro sal(ute) et incol(umitate) reg(is) Masunae gent(ium) Maur(orum) et Romanor(um) castrum edific(atum) a Masgivini pref(ecto) de Safar. Iidir proc(uratore) castra Severian(a) quem Masuna Altava posuit, et Maxim(us) pr(ocurator) Alt(ava) prefec(it). P(ositum) p(rovinciae) CCCLXVIIII".'' The three officials appointed are Masgiven ([[Roman Prefect|prefect]] of Safar), Lidir ([[Procurator (Ancient Rome)|procurator]] of Castra Severiana) and Maximus (procurator of Altava). The date, 469, is the provincial founding date and would correspond to 508 AD.{{sfn|Graham|1902|p=281}}{{sfn|Conant|2004|p=|pp=199–224}}

The core administrative centers of the kingdom were located on the territorial interface of two distinct populations, the coastal and settled provincial ''Romani'' (Romans) and the tribal ''Mauri'' (Moors, or Berbers) situated around and beyond the former Roman frontier.{{sfn|Merrills|2017|p=}}{{Page needed|date=April 2018}} The citizens of the Roman cities were subjects of a formal and organized administration headed by appointed officials, such as those appointed by King Masuna. The military manpower was derived from the Berber tribes over which control was maintained through the control of key individuals, such as tribal leaders, by issuing honors and estates to them.{{sfn|Merrills|2017|p=}} As the Mauro-Roman Kingdom adopted the military, religious and sociocultural organization of the Roman Empire, it continued to be fully within the Western Latin world. The administrative structure and titulature used by the rulers of the kingdom suggests a certain romanized political identity in the region.{{sfn|Conant|2012|p=280}} This Roman political identity was maintained by other smaller Berber kingdoms in the region as well, such as in the [[Kingdom of the Aures]] where King [[Masties]] claimed the title of ''[[Imperator]]'' during his rule around 516 AD, postulating that he had not broken trust with either his Berber or Roman subjects.{{sfn|Rousseau|2012|p=}}

=== The Eastern Roman Empire and the Vandals ===
Eastern Roman records referring to the Vandal Kingdom, which had occupied much of the old Roman province of Africa and coastal parts of Mauretania, often refer to it with regards to a trinity of peoples; Vandals, [[Alans]] and Moors, and though some Berbers had assisted the Vandals in their conquests in Africa, Berber expansion was more often than not focused against the Vandals rather than with them, which would lead to some expansion of the Mauro-Roman Kingdom and other Berber kingdoms of the region, such as the Kingdom of the Aures.{{sfn|Wolfram|2005|p=170}}

Indeed, a Berber king identified by the historian [[Procopius]] of the Eastern Roman Empire as "''Massonas''" (often assumed to be the same person as Masuna) allied with the forces of the Eastern Roman Empire in 535 AD against the Vandal Kingdom during the [[Vandalic War]].{{sfn|Martindale|1980|p=734}} When Belisarius and the Eastern Roman forces arrived in Northern Africa to invade and restore Roman rule over the region, local Berber rulers willingly submitted to Imperial rule, only demanding in return the symbols of their offices; a silver crown, a staff of silver gilt, a tunic and gilded boots. Essentially [[client king]]s, many of the Berber rulers would prove recalcitrant. Those rulers that were not directly adjacent to Imperial territories were more or less independent, though nominally still Imperial subjects, and were treated with larger amounts of courtesy than the ones directly bordering the Empire, as to keep them in line.{{sfn|Grierson|1959|p=127}}

Following the Eastern Roman re-conquest of the Vandal Kingdom, the local governors began to experience problems with the local Berber tribes. The province of [[Byzacena]] was invaded and the local garrison, including the commanders Gainas and Rufinus, was defeated. The newly appointed [[Praetorian prefect of Africa|Praetorian Prefect of Africa]], [[Solomon (Byzantine general)|Solomon]], waged several wars against these Berber tribes, leading an army of around 18,000 men into Byzacena. Solomon would defeat them and return to Carthage, though the Berbers would again rise and overrun Byzacena. Solomon would once again defeat them, this time decisively, scattering the Berber forces. Surviving Berber soldiers retreated into [[Numidia]] where they joined forces with [[Iabdas (Berber king)|Iabdas]], [[Kingdom of the Aures|King of the Aures]].{{sfn|Martindale|1992|p=1171}}{{sfn|Bury|1958|p=143}}

Masuna, allied with the Eastern Empire, and another Berber king, [[Ortaias]] (who ruled a kingdom in the former province of [[Mauretania Sitifensis]]),{{sfn|Grierson|1959|p=126}} urged Solomon to pursue the enemy Berbers into Numidia, which he did. Solomon did not engage Iabdas in battle however, distrusting the loyalty of his allies, and instead constructed a series of fortified posts along the roads linking Byzacena with Numidia.{{sfn|Martindale|1992|p=1172}}{{sfn|Bury|1958|p=143}}

Masuna died around 535 AD and was succeeded as King of the Moors and Romans by [[Mastigas]] (also known as Mastinas). Procopius states that Mastigas was a fully independent ruler who ruled almost the entire former province of Mauretania Caesariensis, except for the former provincial capital, Caesarea, which had been under control of the Vandals and was in Eastern Roman hands during his time.{{sfn|Martindale|1992|p=851}} The rulers of the Mauro-Roman Kingdom, and other Berber kingdoms, continued to regard themselves as subjects of the Eastern Roman Emperor in Constantinople, even when they were at war with him or engaged in raids of Imperial territory, most Berber rulers using titles such as ''[[dux]]'' or ''[[Rex (title)|rex]]''.{{sfn|Grierson|1959|p=126}}

=== Collapse ===
The last recorded king of the ''Regnum Maurorum et Romanorum'' was [[Garmul]] (also known as Garmules) who would resist Eastern Roman rule in Africa.{{sfn|Aguado Blazquez|2005|p=46}} In the late 560s, Garmul launched raids into Roman territory, and although he failed to take any significant town, three successive generals, Praetorian prefect Theodore (in 570 AD) and the two ''[[Magister militum|magistri militum]]'' Theoctistus (in 570 AD) and Amabilis (in 571 AD), are recorded by the Visigoth historian [[John of Biclaro]] to have been killed by Garmul's forces.{{sfn|Martindale|1992|p=504}} His activities, especially when regarded together with the simultaneous [[Visigoth]] attacks in [[Spania]], presented a clear threat to the province's authorities. Garmul was not the leader of a mere semi-nomadic tribe, but of a fully-fledged barbarian kingdom, with a standing army. Thus, the new Eastern Roman emperor, [[Tiberius II Constantine]], re-appointed Thomas as praetorian prefect of Africa, and the able general [[Gennadius (6th century)|Gennadius]] was posted as ''magister militum'' with the clear aim of reducing Garmul's kingdom. Preparations were lengthy and careful, but the campaign itself, launched in 577–78 AD, was brief and effective, with Gennadius utilizing terror tactics against Garmul's subjects. Garmul was defeated and killed in 578 AD.{{sfn|Aguado Blazquez|2005|pp=45–46}}

With the defeat of Garmul, the Mauro-Roman Kingdom collapsed. The Eastern Roman Empire re-incorporated some of the territory of the Kingdom, notably the coastal corridor of the old provinces of Mauretania Tingitania and Mauretania Caesariensis.{{sfn|Aguado Blazquez|2005|pp=45–46}}

Altava remained the capital of a romanized Berber kingdom, though the [[Kingdom of Altava]] was significantly smaller in size than the Kingdom of Masuna and Garmul had been.{{sfn|Martindale|1980|p=|pp=509–510}} In the late fifth and early sixth century, [[Christianity]] grew to be the fully dominant religion in the Berber Altava kingdom, with syncretic influences from the [[traditional Berber religion]]. A new church was built in the capital [[Altava]] in this period.{{sfn|Lawless|1969|p=|pp=}} Altava and the other successor kingdoms of the Mauro-Roman Kingdom, the [[Kingdom of the Ouarsenis|Kingdoms of the Ouarsenis]] and [[Kingdom of the Hodna|the Hodna]], also saw an economical rise and the construction of several new churches and fortifications. Though the Eastern Roman Praetorian Prefecture of Africa and the later [[Exarchate of Africa]] would see some further Berber rebellions, these would be put down and many Berber tribes would be accepted as ''foederati'', as they had been many times in the past.{{sfn|Merrills|2017|p=}}

The last known romanized Berber King to rule from Altava was [[Kusaila]]. He died in the year 690 AD fighting against the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]]. He was also leader of the Awraba tribe of the Berbers and possibly Christian head of the [[Sanhaja|Sanhaja confederation]]. He is known for having led an effective Berber martial resistance against the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]'s conquest of the Maghreb in the 680s. In 683 AD [[Uqba ibn Nafi]] was ambushed and killed in the [[Battle of Vescera]] near [[Biskra]] by Kusaila, who forced all Arabs to evacuate their just founded [[Kairouan]] and withdraw to [[Cyrenaica]].{{sfn|Conant|2012|p=|pp=280–281}} But in 688 AD Arab reinforcements from [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] arrived under Zuhair ibn Kays. Kusaila met them in 690 AD, with the support of Eastern Roman troops, at the [[Battle of Mamma]]. Vastly outnumbered, the Awraba and Romans were defeated and Kusaila was killed.{{sfn|Talbi|1971|p=|pp=19–52}}

With the death of Kusaila, the torch of resistance passed to a tribe known as the Jerawa tribe, who had their home in the [[Aurès Mountains]]: his [[Berbers and Christianity|Christian Berber]] troops after his death fought later under [[Kahina]], the queen of the Kingdom of the Aures and the last ruler of the romanized Berbers.{{sfn|Talbi|1971|p=|pp=19–52}}

'''Millennials''', also known as '''Generation Y''' or '''Gen Y''', are the [[generation]]al [[demography|demographic]] [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] following [[Generation X]] and preceding [[Generation Z]]. There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and researchers typically use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years.&lt;!-- This range is based on the sources given in the text below; please seek talk page consensus before changing --&gt;  Millennials are sometimes referred to as "echo boomers" due to a major surge in birth rates in the 1980s and 1990s, and because millennials are often the children of the [[baby boomers]]. Although millennial characteristics vary by region, depending on social and economic conditions, the [[generation]] has been generally marked by an increased use and familiarity with communications, media, and digital technologies.{{fact|date=October 2018}}&lt;!-- Needs a study comparing younger people to older people from previous generations--&gt;

In August 1993, an ''[[Advertising Age]]'' editorial coined the phrase ''Generation Y'' to describe those who were aged 11 or younger as well as the [[teenager]]s of the upcoming ten years who were defined as different from [[Generation X]].&lt;ref&gt;"Generation Y" ''Ad Age'' 30 August 1993. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Trend Ticker: Ahead of the Next Wave |journal=Advertising Age |date=1 September 2003 |first=Peter |last=Francese |url=http://adage.com/article/american-demographics/trend-ticker-ahead-wave/44208/ |accessdate=31 March 2011 |quote=Today's 21-year-olds, who were born in 1982 and are part of the leading edge of Generation Y, are among the most-studied group of young adults ever.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to journalist Bruce Horovitz, in 2012, ''Ad Age'' "threw in the towel by conceding that millennials is a better name than Gen Y",&lt;ref name="Horovitz" /&gt; and by 2014, a past director of data strategy at ''Ad Age'' said to NPR "the Generation Y label was a placeholder until we found out more about them".&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|title=From GIs To Gen Z (Or Is It iGen?): How Generations Get Nicknames|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/06/349316543/don-t-label-me-origins-of-generational-names-and-why-we-use-them|publisher=NPR|accessdate=7 October 2014|author=Samantha Raphelson|date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millennials are sometimes called ''Echo Boomers'',&lt;ref name="usa110605"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/workplace/2005-11-06-gen-y_x.htm|title=Generation Y: They've arrived at work with a new attitude|last=Armour|first=Stephanie|date=6 November 2008|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to their being the offspring of the baby boomers and due to the significant increase in birth rates from the early 1980s to mid 1990s, mirroring that of their parents.

Chinese millennials are commonly called the 1980s and 1990s [[Generation|generations]]. At a 2015 conference in Shanghai organized by [[University of Southern California]]'s US-China Institute, millennials in China were examined and contrasted with American millennials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://china.usc.edu/ University of Southern California US-China Institute] University of Southern California, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Findings included millennials' marriage, childbearing, and child raising preferences, life and career ambitions, and attitudes towards volunteerism and activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://china.usc.edu/video-millennialminds|title=Video: #MillennialMinds|publisher=University of Southern California|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traits ==

Authors [[Strauss and Howe|William Strauss and Neil Howe]] believe that each generation has common characteristics that give it a specific character with four basic generational archetypes, repeating in a cycle. According to their hypothesis, they predicted millennials will become more like the "civic-minded" [[G.I. Generation]] with a strong sense of community both local and global.&lt;ref name="Strauss 2000 370" /&gt; Strauss and Howe ascribe seven basic traits to the millennial cohort: special, sheltered, confident, team-oriented, conventional, pressured, and achieving. Arthur E. Levine, author of ''When Hope and Fear Collide: A Portrait of Today's College Student'' describes these generational images as "stereotypes".&lt;ref name="Hoover"/&gt;

Strauss and Howe's research has been influential, but it also has critics.&lt;ref name="Hoover"&gt;{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Hoover |title=The Millennial Muddle: How stereotyping students became a thriving industry and a bundle of contradictions |date=11 October 2009 |url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Millennial-Muddle-How/48772/ |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |access-date=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Jean Twenge says Strauss and Howe's assertions are overly-deterministic, non-falsifiable, and unsupported by rigorous evidence. Twenge, the author of the 2006 book ''Generation Me'', considers millennials, along with younger members of Generation X, to be part of what she calls "Generation Me".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Twenge|first=Jean M.|title=Generation Me|year=2006|publisher=Free Press (Simon &amp; Schuster)|location=New York|isbn=978-0743276979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenge attributes millennials with the traits of confidence and tolerance, but also describes a sense of [[entitlement]] and [[narcissism]], based on personality surveys showing increased narcissism among millennials compared to preceding generations when they were teens and in their twenties.

The study examined two types of narcissism: grandiose narcissism, described as "the narcissism of [[extraversion|extraverts]], characterized by attention-seeking behavior, power and dominance", and vulnerable narcissism, described as "the narcissism of [[introversion|introverts]], characterized by an acute sense of self-entitlement and defensiveness."&lt;ref name="prnews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="syzygy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Longman|first1=Molly|title=Survey: Iowa millennials not as narcissistic as rest of U.S.|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/life/2016/10/22/survey-iowa-millennials-not-narcissistic-rest-us/92521480/|accessdate=24 October 2016|publisher=The Des Moines Register|date=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Michigan]]'s "Monitoring the Future" study of high school seniors (conducted continually since 1975) and the American Freshman survey, conducted by UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute of new college students since 1966, showed an increase in the proportion of students who consider wealth a very important attribute, from 45% for Baby Boomers (surveyed between 1967 and 1985) to 70% for Gen Xers, and 75% for millennials. The percentage who said it was important to keep abreast of political affairs fell, from 50% for Baby Boomers to 39% for Gen Xers, and 35% for millennials. The notion of "developing a meaningful philosophy of life" decreased the most across generations, from 73% for Boomers to 45% for millennials.

In March 2014, the Pew Research Center issued a report about how "millennials in adulthood" are "detached from institutions and networked with friends."&lt;ref name="Pew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2014/03/2014-03-07_generations-report-version-for-web.pdf|title=Millennials in Adulthood – Detached from Institutions, Networked with Friends|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Millennials in Adulthood"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/03/07/millennials-in-adulthood/|title=Millennials in Adulthood|date=7 March 2014|work=Pew Research Center's Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report said millennials are somewhat more upbeat than older adults about America's future, with 49% of millennials saying the country's best years are ahead though they're the first in the modern era to have higher levels of student loan debt and unemployment.

Fred Bonner, a Samuel DeWitt Proctor Chair in Education at [[Rutgers University]] and author of ''Diverse Millennial Students in College: Implications for Faculty and Student Affairs'', believes that much of the commentary on the Millennial Generation may be partially correct, but overly general and that many of the traits they describe apply primarily to "white, affluent teenagers who accomplish great things as they grow up in the suburbs, who confront anxiety when applying to super-selective colleges, and who multitask with ease as their [[helicopter parents]] hover reassuringly above them." During class discussions, Bonner listened to black and Hispanic students describe how some or all of the so-called core traits did not apply to them. They often said that the "special" trait, in particular, is unrecognizable. Other socio-economic groups often do not display the same attributes commonly attributed to millennials. "It's not that many diverse parents don't want to treat their kids as special," he says, "but they often don't have the [[social capital|social]] and [[cultural capital]], the time and resources, to do that."&lt;ref name="Hoover"/&gt;

In his book ''Fast Future'', author David Burstein describes millennials' approach to social change as "pragmatic idealism" with a deep desire to make the world a better place, combined with an understanding that doing so requires building new institutions while working inside and outside existing institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Burstein, David (2013).

Elza Venter, an educational psychologist and lecturer at Unisa, South Africa, in the Department of Psychology of Education, believes members of Generation Y are digital natives because they have grown up experiencing digital technology and have known it all their lives. Prensky &lt;ref&gt;Prensky, M. (2001). "Digital natives, digital immigrants": Part 1. ''On the Horizon'', 9(5), 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt; coined the concept ‘digital natives’ because this generation are ‘native speakers of the digital language of computers, video games and the internet’. This generation spans 20 years and its older members use a combination of face-to-face communication and computer [[mediated communication]], while its younger members use mainly electronic and digital technologies for interpersonal communication.&lt;ref&gt;Elza Venter (5 January 2017).

There are vast, and conflicting, amounts of literature and empirical studies discussing the existence of generational differences as it pertains to the workplace.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The majority of research concludes millennials differ from both their generational cohort predecessors, and can be characterized by a preference for a flat corporate culture, an emphasis on [[Work–life balance|work-life balance]] and social consciousness.{{qualify evidence}}&lt;!-- What % of them share this preference? --&gt;

According to authors from [[Florida International University]], original research performed by Howe and Strauss as well as Yu &amp; Miller suggest Baby Boomers resonate primarily with loyalty, work ethic, steady career path, and compensation when it comes to their professional lives.&lt;ref name="FIU"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huyler|first1=Debaro|last2=Pierre|first2=Yselande|last3=Ding|first3=Wei|last4=Norelus|first4=Adly|title=Millennials in the Workplace: Positioning Companies for Future Success|url=http://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1424&amp;context=sferc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generation X on the other hand, started shifting preferences towards an improved work-life balance with a heightened focus on individual advancement, stability, and job satisfaction.&lt;ref name="FIU" /&gt; Meanwhile, millennials place an emphasis on producing meaningful work, finding a creative outlet, and have a preference for immediate feedback.&lt;ref name="FIU" /&gt; In the article "Challenges of the Work of the Future," it is also stressed that millennials working at the knowledge-based jobs very often assume personal responsibility in order to make the most of what they do. As they are not satisfied with remaining for a long period of time at the same job, their career paths become more dynamic and less predictable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bondar|first1=Kateryna|title=Challenges of the Work of the Future|url=http://innovacima.com/en/2017/11/29/challenges-work-future/|website=InnovaCima|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings also suggest the introduction of social media has augmented collaborative skills and created a preference for a team-oriented environment.&lt;ref name="FIU" /&gt; 

In the 2010 the ''[[Journal of Business and Psychology]],'' contributors Myers and Sadaghiani find millennials "expect close relationships and frequent feedback from supervisors" to be a main point of differentiation.&lt;ref name="Myers and Sadaghiani"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myers|first1=Karen K.|last2=Sadaghiani|first2=Kamyab|title=Millennials in the Workplace: A Communication Perspective on Millennials' Organizational Relationships and Performance|journal=Journal of Business and Psychology|date=1 January 2010|volume=25|issue=2|pages=225–238|doi=10.1007/s10869-010-9172-7|pmid=20502509|jstor=40605781|pmc=2868990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple studies observe millennials’ associating job satisfaction with free flow of information, strong connectivity to supervisors, and more immediate feedback.&lt;ref name="Myers and Sadaghiani" /&gt; Hershatter and Epstein, researchers from [[Emory University]], argue a lot of these traits can be linked to millennials entering the educational system on the cusp of academic reform, which created a much more structured educational system.&lt;ref name="Hershatter and Epstein"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hershatter|first1=Andrea|last2=Epstein|first2=Molly|title=Millennials and the World of Work: An Organization and Management Perspective|journal=Journal of Business and Psychology|date=1 January 2010|volume=25|issue=2|pages=211–223|doi=10.1007/s10869-010-9160-y|jstor=40605780}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue in the wake of these reforms, such as the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], millennials have increasingly sought the aid of mentors and advisers, leading to 66% of millennials seeking a flat work environment.&lt;ref name="Hershatter and Epstein"/&gt;

Hershatter and Epstein also stress a growing importance on work-life balance. Studies show nearly one-third of students' top priority is to "balance personal and professional life".&lt;ref name="Hershatter and Epstein" /&gt; The Brain Drain Study shows nearly 9 out of 10 millennials place an importance on work-life balance, with additional surveys demonstrating the generation to favor familial over corporate values.&lt;ref name="Hershatter and Epstein" /&gt; Studies also show a preference for work-life balance, which contrasts to the Baby Boomers' work-centric attitude.&lt;ref name="Myers and Sadaghiani" /&gt;

Data also suggests millennials are driving a shift towards the public service sector. In 2010, Myers and Sadaghiani published research in the ''Journal of Business and Psychology'' stating heightened participation in the [[Peace Corps]] and [[AmeriCorps]] as a result of millennials, with volunteering being at all-time highs.&lt;ref name="Myers and Sadaghiani" /&gt; Volunteer activity between 2007 and 2008 show the millennial age group experienced almost three-times the increase of the overall population, which is consistent with a survey of 130 college upperclassmen depicting an emphasis on altruism in their upbringing.&lt;ref name="Myers and Sadaghiani" /&gt; This has led, according to a Harvard University Institute of Politics, six out of ten millennials to consider a career in public service.&lt;ref name="Myers and Sadaghiani" /&gt;

The 2014 Brookings publication shows a generational adherence to corporate social responsibility, with the National Society of High School Scholars (NSHSS) 2013 survey and Universum's 2011 survey, depicting a preference to work for companies engaged in the betterment of society.&lt;ref name="Brookings"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winograd|first1=Morley|last2=Hais|first2=Michael|title=How Millennials Could Upend Wall Street and Corporate America {{!}} Brookings Institution|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-millennials-could-upend-wall-street-and-corporate-america/|website=Brookings|publisher=Brookings Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millennials' shift in attitudes has led to data depicting 64% of millennials would take a 60% pay cut to pursue a career path aligned with their passions, and financial institutions have fallen out of favor with banks comprising 40% of the generation's least liked brands.&lt;ref name="Brookings" /&gt;

In 2008, author Ron Alsop called the millennials "Trophy Kids,"&lt;ref name="Alsop08" /&gt; a term that reflects a trend in competitive sports, as well as many other aspects of life, where mere participation is frequently enough for a reward. It has been reported that this is an issue in corporate environments.&lt;ref name="Alsop08"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alsop|first=Ron|title=The Trophy Kids Grow Up: How the Millennial Generation is Shaking Up the Workplace|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year= 2008|isbn=978-0-470-22954-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ta6Jb47xoZQC&amp;dq=The+Trophy+Kids+Grow+Up:+How+the+Millennial+Generation+is+Shaking+Up+the+Workplace |accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some employers are concerned that millennials have too great expectations from the workplace.&lt;ref name="WSJ_Trophy_Kids"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sec.online.wsj.com/article/SB122455219391652725.html|title=The Trophy Kids Go to Work|last=Alsop|first=Ron|date=21 October 2008|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=24 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies predict they will switch jobs frequently, holding many more jobs than Gen Xers due to their great expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Kunreuther, Frances; Kim, Helen &amp; Rodriguez, Robby (2009). ''Working Across Generations'', San Francisco, CA. {{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Jean Twenge reports data suggests there are differences between older and younger millennials regarding workplace expectations, with younger millennials being "more practical" and "more attracted to industries with steady work and are more likely to say they are willing to work overtime" which Twenge attributes to younger millennials coming of age following the financial crisis of 2007–2008.&lt;ref name=NYMAG/&gt;

There is also a contention that the major differences are found solely between millennials and Generation X. Researchers from the [[University of Missouri]] and The [[University of Tennessee]] conducted a study based on measurement equivalence to determine if such a difference does in fact exist.&lt;ref name="MWEP"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meriac|first1=John P.|last2=Woehr|first2=David J.|last3=Banister|first3=Christina|title=Generational Differences in Work Ethic: An Examination of Measurement Equivalence Across Three Cohorts|journal=Journal of Business and Psychology|date=1 January 2010|volume=25|issue=2|pages=315–324|doi=10.1007/s10869-010-9164-7|jstor=40605789}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study looked at 1,860 participants who had completed the Multidimensional Work Ethic Profile (MWEP), a survey aimed at measuring identification with work-ethic characteristics, across a 12-year period spanning from 1996 to 2008.&lt;ref name="MWEP" /&gt; The results of the findings suggest the main difference in work ethic sentiments arose between the two most recent generational cohorts, Generation X and millennials, with relatively small variances between the two generations and their predecessor, the Baby Boomers.&lt;ref name="MWEP" /&gt;

That said, some research fails to find convincing differences. A meta study conducted by researchers from The [[George Washington University]] and The [[U.S. Army]] Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences questions the validity of workplace differences across any generational cohort. According to the researchers, disagreement in which events to include when assigning generational cohorts, as well as varied opinions on which age ranges to include in each generational category are the main drivers behind their skepticism.&lt;ref name="Workplace Meta Study"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Costanza|first1=David P.|last2=Badger|first2=Jessica M.|last3=Fraser|first3=Rebecca L.|last4=Severt|first4=Jamie B.|last5=Gade|first5=Paul A.|title=Generational Differences in Work-Related Attitudes: A Meta-analysis|journal=Journal of Business and Psychology|date=1 January 2012|volume=27|issue=4|pages=375–394|doi=10.1007/s10869-012-9259-4|jstor=41682990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis of 20 research reports focusing on the three work-related factors of job satisfaction, organizational commitment and intent to turn over proved any variation was too small to discount the impact of employee tenure and aging of individuals.&lt;ref name="Workplace Meta Study" /&gt; Newer research shows that millennials change jobs for the same reasons as other generations—namely, more money and a more innovative work environment.

==Political views==
Surveys of political attitudes among millennials in the United Kingdom have suggested increasingly [[social liberalism|social liberal]] views, as well as higher overall support for [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] economic policies than preceding generations. They are more likely to support [[same-sex marriage]] and the legalization of drugs.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21578666-britains-youth-are-not-just-more-liberal-their-elders-they-are-also-more-liberal-any | work=The Economist | title=Generation Boris}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Economist'' parallels this with millennials in the United States, whose attitudes are more supportive of social liberal policies and same-sex marriage relative to other demographics.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt; They are also more likely to oppose [[animal testing]] for medical purposes than older generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/162881/older-americans-moral-attitudes-changing.aspx|title=Older Americans' Moral Attitudes Changing|author=Gallup, Inc.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pew Research]] described millennials as "the force of the youth vote" and as part of the  political conversation which helped elect the [[Barack Obama|first U.S. black president]], describing millennials as between 12 and 27 during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S Presidential election]].&lt;ref name=Pew2018&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/01/defining-generations-where-millennials-end-and-post-millennials-begin/|title=Defining generations: Where Millennials end and post-Millennials begin|last=|first=|date=March 2018|website=www.pewresearch.org|publisher=Pews Research Center|access-date=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Bernie Sanders]], a self-proclaimed [[democratic socialist]] and democratic candidate in the [[2016 United States presidential election]], was the most popular candidate among millennial voters in the [[United States presidential primary|primary phase]], having garnered more votes from people under 30 in 21 states than the major parties' candidates, [[Donald Trump]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], did combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=More young people voted for Bernie Sanders than Trump and Clinton combined — by a lot|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/20/more-young-people-voted-for-bernie-sanders-than-trump-and-clinton-combined-by-a-lot/|access-date=6 August 2016|publisher=The Washington Post|date=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' viewed him as changing the way millennials viewed politics, saying, "He's not moving a party to the left.

In the United Kingdom, the majority of millennials opposed [[Brexit|the British withdrawal from the European Union]]. Blaming [[Baby boomers]], who largely supported the referendum, one commenter said: "The younger generation has lost the right to live and work in 27 other countries.

[[File:Safe Space America Truck.jpg|thumb|A Safe Space America vehicle in 2016, which is used to promote the availability and creation of [[safe space]]s]]
[[Neil Howe]] believes that a defining trait of millennials is that they are more likely to support [[political correctness]] than members of older generations.&lt;ref name=HowePC&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=Why Do Millennials Love Political Correctness?

Support for restricting offensive speech was lower among older generations, with 27% of Gen Xers, 24% of Baby Boomers, and only 12% of the Silent Generation supporting such restrictions.

==Demographics in the United States==
Millennial population size varies, depending on the definition used. [[William Strauss and Neil Howe]] projected in their 1991 book ''Generations'' that the U.S. millennial population would be 76 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FTGY-uoCCCoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=generations#v=onepage&amp;q=generations&amp;f=false |title=Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069 |publisher=Harper Perennial |year=1991|isbn=9780688119126 }}p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; Later,{{when|date=December 2014}} using dates ranging from 1982 to 2004, Neil Howe revised the number to over 95 million people (in the U.S.).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} In a 2012 [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] article, it was estimated that there were approximately 80 million U.S. millennials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.time.com/2012/03/29/millennials-vs-baby-boomers-who-would-you-rather-hire/|title=Millennials vs. Baby Boomers: Who Would You Rather Hire?|author=Dan Schawbel|publisher=Time Magazine|date=29 March 2012|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Census Bureau]], using birth dates ranging from 1982 to 2000, stated the estimated number of U.S. millennials in 2015 was 83.1 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Millennials Outnumber Baby Boomers and Are Far More Diverse|url = https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-113.html|website = www.census.gov|accessdate = 5 October 2015|first = US Census|last = Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Pew Research Center]] found that millennials surpassed Baby Boomers to become the largest living generation in the United States.

They're being "marginalized and face uncertain working conditions" in jobs that are unrelated to their educational background, and receive the minimum allowable base [[salary]] of €700 per month.

''Generation Flux'' is a [[neologism]] and [[psychographic]] (not demographic) designation coined by ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' for [[economy of the United States|American employees]] who need to make several changes in [[career]] throughout their working lives due to the chaotic nature of the job market following the Great Recession.

Millennials are expected to make up approximately half of the U.S. workforce by 2020. Millennials are the most highly educated and culturally diverse group of all generations, and have been regarded as hard to please when it comes to employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2013/03/07/7-surprising-ways-to-motivate-millennial-workers/#27d2e85b4ed9|title=7 Surprising Ways To Motivate Millennial Workers|first=Jenna|last=Goudreau|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address these new challenges, many large firms are currently studying the social and behavioral patterns of millennials and are trying to devise programs that decrease intergenerational estrangement, and increase relationships of reciprocal understanding between older employees and millennials. The UK's [[Institute of Leadership &amp; Management]] researched the gap in understanding between millennial recruits and their managers in collaboration with [[Ashridge Business School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-l-m.com/research-and-comment/generationy.aspx |title=Great Expectations: Managing Generation Y, 2011 |publisher=I-l-m.com |date=8 July 2011 |accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings included high expectations for advancement, salary and for a coaching relationship with their manager, and suggested that organizations will need to adapt to accommodate and make the best use of millennials. In an example of a company trying to do just this, [[Goldman Sachs]] conducted training programs that used actors to portray millennials who assertively sought more [[feedback]], [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], and involvement in decision making. After the performance, employees discussed and debated the generational differences they saw played out.&lt;ref name="Alsop08" /&gt;

Millennials have benefited the least from the economic recovery following the [[Great Recession]], as average incomes for this generation have fallen at twice the general adult population's total drop and are likely to be on a path toward lower incomes for at least another decade. A [[Bloomberg L.P.]] article wrote that "Three and a half years after the worst recession since the [[Great Depression]], the earnings and employment gap between those in the under-35 population and their parents and grandparents threatens to unravel the American dream of each generation doing better than the last. The nation's younger workers have benefited least from an economic recovery that has been the most uneven in recent history."&lt;ref name="AmericanDream"&gt;Smith, Elliot Blair.

== Peter Pan generation ==
American sociologist Kathleen Shaputis labeled millennials as the ''[[Boomerang Generation]]'' or ''[[Peter Pan]] generation'', because of the members' perceived tendency for delaying some [[rites of passage]] into adulthood for longer periods than most generations before them. These labels were also a reference to a trend toward members living with their parents for longer periods than previous generations.&lt;ref name="Shaputis"&gt;Shaputis, Kathleen (2004). ''The Crowded Nest Syndrome: Surviving the Return of Adult Children''. Clutter Fairy Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0972672702}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimberly Palmer regards the high cost of housing and higher education, and the relative affluence of older generations, as among the factors driving the trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2007/12/12/the-new-parent-trap_print.html |author=Palmer, Kimberly|title=The New Parent Trap: More Boomers Help Adult Kids out Financially |work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |date=12 December 2007 |accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questions regarding a clear definition of what it means to be an adult also impacts a debate about delayed transitions into adulthood and the emergence of a new life stage, Emerging Adulthood. A 2012 study by professors at [[Brigham Young University]] found that college students were more likely to define "adult" based on certain personal abilities and characteristics rather than more traditional "rite of passage" events.&lt;ref name="Nelson07"&gt;{{cite web|author=Brittani Lusk |url=http://www.heraldextra.com/news/article_3db6743c-35bc-5e6a-a737-938b93f57ac3.html |title=Study Finds Kids Take Longer to Reach Adulthood |work=[[Provo Daily Herald]] |date=5 December 2007 |accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Nelson noted that "In prior generations, you get married and you start a career and you do that immediately. What young people today are seeing is that approach has led to divorces, to people unhappy with their careers … The majority want to get married […] they just want to do it right the first time, the same thing with their careers."&lt;ref name="Nelson07" /&gt; Their expectations have had a dampening effect on millennials' rate of marriage. 

A 2013 joint study by sociologists at the [[University of Virginia]] and [[Harvard University]] found that the decline and disappearance of stable full-time jobs with [[Health insurance in the United States|health insurance]] and pensions for people who lack a college degree has had profound effects on [[working-class Americans]], who now are less likely to marry and have children within marriage than those with college degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-08/asa-law080613.php|title=Love and work don't always work for working class in America, study shows|date=13 August 2013|publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from a 2014 study of U.S. millennials revealed over 56% of this cohort considers themselves as part of the working class, with only approximately 35% considering themselves as part of the middle class; this class identity is the lowest polling of any generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/15/us-millennials-feel-more-working-class-than-any-other-generation |title=US millennials feel more working class than any other generation |work=The Guardian |accessdate=15 March 2016 |date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by the [[Urban Institute]] conducted in 2014, projected that if current trends continue, millennials will have a lower marriage rate compared to previous generations, predicting that by age 40, 31% of millennial women will remain single, approximately twice the share of their single Gen X counterparts.

Data also showed a significant increase in the percentage of young adults living with parents compared to the previous demographic cohort, [[Generation X]], with 23% of young adults aged 18–34 living with parents in 2000, rising to 32% in 2014. Additionally, in 2000, 43% of those aged 18–34 were married or living with a partner, with this figure dropping to 32% in 2014. High student debt is described as one reason for continuing to live with parents, but may not be the dominant factor for this shift as the data shows the trend is stronger for those without a college education. Richard Fry, a senior economist for Pew Research said of millennials, "they're the group much more likely to live with their parents." furthering "they're concentrating more on school, careers and work and less focused on forming new families, spouses or partners and children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More young adults live with parents than partners, a first|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-millennials-live-at-home-20160524-snap-story.html|accessdate=31 May 2016|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fry|first1=Richard|title=For First Time in Modern Era, Living With Parents Edges Out Other Living Arrangements for 18- to 34-Year-Olds|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/05/24/for-first-time-in-modern-era-living-with-parents-edges-out-other-living-arrangements-for-18-to-34-year-olds/|accessdate=31 May 2016|publisher=Pew Research|date=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a cross-generational study comparing millennials to Generation X conducted at [[Wharton School of Business]], more than half of millennial undergraduates surveyed do not plan to have children. The researchers compared surveys of the Wharton graduating class of 1992 and 2012. In 1992, 78% of women planned to eventually have children dropping to 42% in 2012.

In their 2007 book, authors Junco and Mastrodicasa expanded on the work of [[William Strauss]] and [[Neil Howe]] to include research-based information about the personality profiles of millennials, especially as it relates to higher education. They conducted a large-sample (7,705) research study of [[college]] [[student]]s.

In their survey, they found that 97% of these students owned a [[computer]], 94% owned a [[mobile phone]], and 56% owned an [[MP3 player]].

A 2013 Pew Research Poll found that 84% of millennials, born since 1980, who were at that time between the ages of 18 and 32, favored [[Legalization of marijuana|legalizing the use of marijuana]].&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt; In 2015, the Pew Research Center also conducted research regarding generational identity.&lt;ref name="pporg"/&gt; It was discovered that millennials are less likely to strongly identify with the generational term when compared to Generation X or to the Baby Boomers, with only 40% of those born between 1981 and 1997 identifying as part of the Millennial Generation. Among older millennials, those born 1981–1988, Pew Research found 43% personally identified as members of the older demographic cohort, Generation X, while only 35% identified as millennials. Among younger millennials (born 1989–1997), generational identity was not much stronger, with only 45% personally identifying as millennials. It was also found that millennials chose most often to define themselves with more negative terms such as self-absorbed, wasteful or greedy. In this 2015 report, Pew defined millennials with birth years ranging from 1981 onwards.&lt;ref name="pporg"/&gt;

Along with being educated, millennials also tend to upbeat. As stated above in the economic prospects section, about 9 out of 10 millennials feel as though they have enough money or that they will reach their long-term financial goals, even during the tough economic times, and they are more optimistic about the future of the U.S. Additionally, millennials are also more open to change than older generations. According to the Pew Research Center that did a survey in 2008, millennials are the most likely of any generation to self-identify as [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]s and are also more supportive of [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] domestic social agenda than older generations. Finally, millennials are less overtly religious than the older generations. About one in four millennials are unaffiliated with any religion, a considerably higher ratio than that of older generations when they were the ages of millennials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Operation PBHistory''' was a covert operation carried out in [[Guatemala]] by the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). It followed [[Operation PBSuccess]], which led to the overthrow of Guatemalan President [[Jacobo Árbenz]] in June 1954 and ended the [[Guatemalan Revolution]]. PBHistory attempted to use documents left behind by Árbenz's government and by organizations related to the communist [[Guatemalan Party of Labour]] to demonstrate that the [[Guatemalan government]] had been under the influence of the [[Soviet Union]], and to use those documents to obtain further intelligence that would be useful to US intelligence agencies. It was an effort to justify the overthrow of the elected Guatemalan government in response to the negative international reactions to PBSuccess.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=300}} The CIA also hoped to improve its intelligence resources about communist parties in Latin America, a subject on which it had little information.

The first phase of the operation began soon after Árbenz's resignation on June 27, 1954: several agents were dispatched to Guatemala beginning on July 4. These included agents of the CIA and the [[Office of Intelligence Research]] (OIR). The first phase involved the collection of 150,000 documents from sources including Árbenz's personal possessions, trade union offices, and police agencies. The ruling military junta led by [[Carlos Castillo Armas]] aided these efforts. Following a presentation made to US President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] on July 20, a decision was taken to accelerate the operation, and the number of people working in Guatemala was increased. The new team members posed as unaffiliated with the US government to maintain [[plausible deniability]]. The operation helped set up the Guatemalan [[National Committee of Defense Against Communism]], which was covertly funded by the CIA: agents of the committee became involved in PBHistory. The team studied over 500,000 documents in total, and finished processing documents on 28 September 1954.

PBHistory documents were used to support the CIA's existing operations [[Operation Kufire|Kufire]] and [[Operation Kugown|Kugown]], which sought to track Latin American communists and to disseminate information critical of the Árbenz government. Documents were also shared with the [[Kersten Committee|Kersten Committee of the US House of Representatives]], which publicized PBHistory within the US. The documents uncovered by the operation proved useful to the Guatemalan intelligence agencies, enabling the creation of a register of suspected communists. Operation PBHistory did not succeed in its chief objective of finding evidence that the Guatemalan communists were being controlled by the Soviet government, and was unable to counter the international narrative that the United States had toppled the government of Jacobo Árbenz to serve the interests of the [[United Fruit Company]].

The [[Guatemalan Revolution#October Revolution|October revolution]] of 1944 in Guatemala led to the election of [[Juan José Arévalo]] as President of Guatemala, who initiated reforms based on liberal capitalism.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=14–15}}{{sfn|Jiménez|1985|p=149}} Arévalo was an anti-communist, and cracked down on the communist [[Guatemalan Party of Labour]] (''Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo'', PGT).{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=98–99}} The US government was nonetheless suspicious that he was under the influence of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=15–16}} Arévalo's defense minister [[Jacobo Árbenz]] was [[Guatemalan presidential election, 1950|elected president in 1950]].{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=50–69, 73–84}} Influenced partly by [[McCarthyism]], the US government was predisposed to see communist influence in Árbenz's government, particularly after the legalization of the PGT. Árbenz also had personal ties to some PGT members.{{sfn|Cullather|1999|pp=14–28}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=228–230}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=73–84}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=61–67}} In 1952 Árbenz began an [[Decree 900|agrarian reform program]] that transferred uncultivated land from large landowners to poor laborers in return for compensation.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=64–67}} In response the US-based [[United Fruit Company]], which had large landholdings in Guatemala, intensively lobbied the US government for Árbenz's overthrow.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=75–82}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=72–77}}

US President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] authorized a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) operation to overthrow Árbenz, code-named [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|Operation PBSuccess]] in August 1953.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=138–143}} Within the CIA, the operation was headed by [[Frank Wisner]], who had worked in the US intelligence services since World War II.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=108–109}} While preparations for Operation PBSuccess were underway, the US government issued a series of statements denouncing the Guatemalan government, alleging that it had been infiltrated by communists.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=256–257}} On 18 June 1954 [[Carlos Castillo Armas]], a [[Guatemalan armed forces|Guatemalan army]] Colonel in exile since a [[Guatemalan Revolution#1949 coup attempt|failed coup]] in 1949,{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=141–143}} led an invasion force of 480 men into Guatemala.{{sfn|Cullather|1999|pp=87–89}} The invasion was supported by a campaign of [[psychological warfare]], which presented Castillo Armas's victory as a ''fait accompli'' to the Guatemalan people.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=165}} Worried by the possibility of a US invasion, the Guatemalan army refused to fight, and on June 27 Árbenz resigned.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=174}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=330–335}}

[[File:Guatemala in North America (-mini map -rivers).svg|thumb|left|alt=Guatemala lies southeast of Mexico in Central America.|A map showing the position of the Republic of Guatemala in North America]]

The actions of the United States resulted in international outrage. Media outlets across the world accused the US of sponsoring a coup to reverse Árbenz's agrarian reform in the interests of the United Fruit Company.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=301–302}} This criticism was influenced by the coverage put out by media outlets in communist-controlled countries, but was repeated in the media in countries that were US allies, with Britain's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the Swedish [[Social Democratic Party]] joining in.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=301–302}} Latin American opposition to the US reached a new peak: author Daniel James stated that "No one could recall so intense and universal a wave of anti-US sentiment in the entire history of Latin America."{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=302–303}}{{sfn|James|1954|p=13}} Although people within the US saw the coup as a triumph for US foreign policy,{{sfn|Gunn|2008|pp=149–150}} CIA officials felt that in order for Operation PBSuccess to be termed a success, further action was needed. Thus, the CIA was interested in finding documents that would allow it to portray the administration of Árbenz as being controlled by Soviet communists, and thus to justify the coup.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=301–302}}

Due to the quick overthrow of the Árbenz government, the CIA believed that the government and the PGT leaders would not have been able to destroy any incriminating documents, and that these could be analyzed to demonstrate Árbenz's supposed ties to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=301–302}}{{sfn|Gunn|2008|pp=149–150}} According to historian [[Nick Cullather]], Wisner hoped to "expose Soviet machinations throughout the hemisphere".{{sfn|Cullather|1999|p=106}} The CIA also believed that it could better understand the workings of Latin American communist parties, on which subject the CIA had very little information.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=301–302}} Although there had been an active communist movement in Latin America since 1919, it had largely been clandestine, and the CIA knew little about the methods that parties like the PGT used.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=301–302}} The CIA hoped that PGT records left behind in haste would enable its international Communism Division to reconstruct the party's leadership and organizational structure, and possibly do the same for other communist parties in the region.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=301–302}}

The CIA also hoped to exploit the aftermath of the coup to bolster its own intelligence resources. Wisner, who was serving as [[Deputy Director for Plans]] at the time of the coup, hoped to recruit agents both from among communists who wanted to defect, and from other Guatemalans who might become a part of the new government.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=301}} In Wisner's words, he wished to identify "people who can be controlled and exploited to further US policy".{{sfn|Cullather|1999|p=106}} Furthermore, the agency hoped to use the findings of the operation to demonstrate the extent of Soviet influence for propaganda purposes, and also to use the information gathered to completely eliminate any communist influence in Guatemala.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=301–302}}

==Document analysis==

===First phase===
On June 30, 1954, three days after the resignation of Árbenz, Wisner sent a telegram that later became known as the "shift of gears cable".{{sfn|Cullather|1999|p=106}}{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=301}} Two agents from the CIA, and two from the [[Office of Intelligence Research]] (OIR), arrived in Guatemala City on July 4. Castillo Armas had arrived in the capital on the previous day to assume the presidency.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=303–304}} One of the CIA officers was Lothar Metzl, who was on the [[counterintelligence]] staff of the CIA.  Metzl was an Austrian, who had studied communist movements since the 1930s, including in Europe.{{sfn|Cullather|1999|p=106}}{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=303–304}} In Wisner's words, the agents were supposed to perform a "snatch job on documents while the melon was freshly burst open".{{sfn|Cullather|1999|p=106}}

The initial targets of the operation were the personal possessions and documents of Árbenz and those of [[Carlos Enrique Díaz]] (who had been chief of the armed forces under Árbenz, and briefly his successor as president), the offices of trade unions, known front organizations, police agencies, and the headquarters of the [[Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo]] (PGT).{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=303–304}} The results of the initial searches were disappointing for the CIA; many of the offices had already been plundered both by the Guatemalan army and by other looters.{{sfn|Gunn|2008|pp=149–150}}{{sfn|Cullather|1999|p=106}}{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=303–304}} The CIA were particularly interested in finding documents that mentioned the Árbenz government's purchase of weapons from [[Czechoslovakia]], but they were unsuccessful. They were also unsuccessful in finding any evidence that the Soviet Union had controlled the communist movement in Guatemala.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=303–304}}

Despite these difficulties, the agents collected 150,000 documents, in addition to a number of government files, which the agency judged to be useful. The CIA received assistance in collecting these from Castillo Armas's junta, and from the Guatemalan army. The haul was described as the "greatest catch of documents ever left behind by a Communist Party and its auxiliaries".{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=304}}{{sfn|Cullather|1999|p=107}} Most of these had nothing but "local significance".{{sfn|Cullather|1999|p=107}} Although no documents were discovered demonstrating Soviet influence, the CIA hoped to use the large number of papers to show that the communists in Guatemala had had a large influence over the government, through institutions like labor unions, peasant organizations, student unions, and youth groups.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=304}}{{sfn|Cullather|1999|p=107}}

On July 20, the CIA agents presented the results of their first two weeks of work in Washington. At Wisner's request, [[Tracy Barnes]]—principal manager of CIA operations in PBSuccess—created a booklet from these documents to show to US President Dwight Eisenhower.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=305}} The 23 documents in the booklet included communist literature owned by Árbenz, such as a Chinese study on agrarian reform and some Marxist volumes, as well as diplomatic records implying communist sympathies, and a biography of [[Joseph Stalin]] belonging to Árbenz's wife [[Maria Cristina Villanova de Árbenz|Maria Cristina Villanova]].{{sfn|Cullather|1999|p=107}}{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=305}} After the presentation, Wisner decided that the examination of the seized documents needed to proceed faster, and so expanded the group of agents working in Guatemala.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=305}}

One of the aims of the new team was to help Castillo Armas establish an intelligence agency that would be able to fight communism in Guatemala. Castillo Armas was pressured to create an anti-communist task force, which he did on July 20—creating the [[National Committee of Defense Against Communism]] (''Comité de Defensa Nacional contra el Comunismo''). The purpose of this group was to create an anti-communist bureaucracy and intelligence service and to organize records and facilitate PBHistory. The ''Comité'' secretly received funds from the CIA, with the understanding that this fact could prove "very embarrassing" and that a new source would eventually need to be found.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=306}} Although the ''Comité'' was theoretically an intelligence agency, it also had some police powers. It could order the arrest of anybody suspected of being a communist, and had oversight over all army and police authorities. The CIA team was supposed to help it set up by creating a nucleus of information about people associated with the PGT.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=306}}

The ''Comité'' was not, however, granted the power to arrest or search house of prominent government officials who had served under Árbenz. This was largely because Castillo Armas and other military leaders lacked trust in the ''Comité''.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=307}} Nevertheless, the ''Comité'' was able to conduct personal searches of exiles as they left the country. This proved to be ineffective as very few documents proved to be revealing.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=307}}

===Second phase===

On August 4, a new and larger US contingent was deployed to Guatemala. In order to remain covert, this group identified itself to Armas as the "Social Research Group", composed of businessmen and experts from universities. It consisted of eight CIA officers, three men from the State Department, and one from the US Information Agency.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=305}} It was led by an officer working under the pseudonym "Francis T. Mylkes," and included [[David Atlee Phillips]], who was fluent in Spanish and had been part of the PBSuccess team. The group presented itself as unaffiliated with the US government in order to avoid nationalist backlash and to maintain [[plausible deniability]].{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=306}} The new PBHistory group worked directly with the new Guatemalan ''Comité'' training its 25 agents and using them to procure documents; the training covered topics including screening, organizing, and classifying confiscated documents, as well as "the rudiments of mail control, logging, abstracting, and cryptic reference".{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=306}}

Eventually, the 25 personnel of the ''Comité'' joined the CIA officers in sorting and processing the seized documents. The CIA officers had a separate side entrance to the building in which the operations took place, in order to maintain the image that the operation was a Guatemalan internal affair.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=307}} The task of sorting through the papers proved to be daunting: by September, the main index of the material contained 15,800 cards. All hand-written material was preserved, and multiple copies of printed material were kept. Every document had to be reproduced, because the original copies of each one were to remain in Guatemala.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=307}} Approximately half of the paper that had been gathered was incinerated. The CIA gave the highest priority to the documents seized from the PGT.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=307}}

By September 1954, the PBHistory agents had found only a small number of top secret documents. Some of the documents showed that government officials and communist party leaders had been able to dispose of most of the sensitive material before they left.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=307}} In the period of uncertain leadership that followed Árbenz's overthrow, a member of one of the series of ruling juntas had prevented the ''Comité'' from searching the homes of private citizens, and from arresting them, which potentially reduced the number of sensitive documents the CIA had access to. Additionally, Castillo Armas stated after taking power that the intelligence information of the army had been completely destroyed.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=307}}

The CIA finished processing documents on September 28, 1954. By this point, the agents had parsed through more than 500,000 unique documents. Photostatic copies were taken of 2,095 important documents, 750 photographs of the material were published for the use of the media, and 50,000 documents were microfilmed.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=307}}{{sfn|Holly|Patterson|2003}} Copies of a handful of important documents were distributed to the various agencies that had been a part of PBHistory, as well as the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=307}}

==Document exploitation==
The agencies that participated in Operation PBHistory had different aims in mind for the products of the operation. The CIA was most interested in using the information gathered against communist movements in Latin America and elsewhere. The State Department wanted to use them to reconstruct the history of the communist party within Guatemala, while the highest priority of the [[United States Information Agency]] was to use the documents to release information that could be used to change international opinion.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=308}} The agents in charge of the operation were expected to balance these interests: however, as the organization behind the operation, the CIA had veto power over any public use.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=308}} The work done by the PBHistory team assisted two existing CIA operations, [[Operation Kufire]] and [[Operation Kugown]], both of which had been a part of Operation PBSuccess.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=308–309}}

===Operation Kufire===
{{Main|Operation Kufire}}
[[File:GuerrilleroHeroico.jpg|thumb|Border|right|alt=Black and white image of a long-haired, bearded man of about 30, wearing a military beret and vest|Cuban revolutionary [[Ernesto "Che" Guevara]]. The CIA opened a file on him as a consequence of Operation PBHistory and Operation Kufire, while he was still only known as a physician.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=309}}]]
Operation Kufire was a wide-ranging effort to track communists from various countries across Latin America who had come to Guatemala during the presidency of Árbenz.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=308–309}} The CIA expected that these individuals would return to their home countries, or to other countries that had liberal policies about political asylum, and by tracking them, the CIA hoped to disrupt their activities.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=308–309}} During the course of this operation, a CIA analyst asked Philips whether to open a file on a 25-year old physician, who did not at the time appear to be particularly threatening. Philips said yes, thereby opening a file on [[Che Guevara|Ernesto "Che" Guevara]], which would quickly become one of the thickest files the CIA had on a single individual.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=309}} Few other documents resulted in files that were of enduring value to the CIA.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=309}}

===Operation Kugown===
{{Main|Operation Kugown}}
Operation Kugown was the name given to the psychological warfare operation that had played an important part in the overthrow of Árbenz. During the coup, its primary targets had been the Árbenz government. After the conclusion of the coup, Kugown continued, targeting the rest of Guatemala, and the wider international audience.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=309}} The aim of the operation was to disseminate derogatory information about Árbenz,{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=309}} and to convince Guatemalans—and the rest of the world—that Árbenz's regime had been communist-dominated.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=309–310}} The use of documents from PBHistory for Operation Kugown began in August 1954. The standard method employed by the CIA was to select a document that could be portrayed as incriminating and write an explanation covering it. This would then be released to the press by the ''Comité'', so that the local agency could receive some credit.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=310}} The ''Comité'' also released a short documentary film, titled ''Despues Descubrimos La Verdad'' ("''Later We Discover the Truth''"). Through these avenues news media in Guatemala and elsewhere in Central America were saturated with stories of how the Árbenz government had been controlled by communists.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=310}}

While the press releases had a substantial impact within Guatemala, the CIA was unable to staunch the continued criticism of the US role in the coup, which came from virtually all countries except for [[West Germany]] and the US itself. Very few news agencies chose to run the press releases from the ''Comité'', even though a number of them were put out.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=310}} Information was sent to press agencies worldwide describing infiltration by the PGT and links among Communists elsewhere; nonetheless, their impact remained minimal.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=310}} The lack of attention frustrated the PBHistory agents to the point where they planned to stage a [[false flag]] attack on their own headquarters, which would later be described as the work of Guatemala's remaining communists.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=311}} However, the CIA decided that such an attack would need the cooperation of too many "indigenous" people, and the plan was scrapped as being too risky.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=311}} Operation Kugown also released a large quantity of communist propaganda material that had entered Guatemala from countries within the Soviet sphere of influence; these convinced American journalists such as Donald Grant, of the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', that there must have been a connection between Árbenz and the Soviet government.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=311}}{{sfn|Grant|1955}}{{sfn|Grant|1954}} Ultimately, these operations were unsuccessful in convincing Latin America that the 1954 coup was justified.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=321–322}}

}}
Information from the PBHistory documents was disseminated by the officials of both the US and Guatemalan governments. US ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] made use of 21 documents in a speech he made at the [[United Nations]].{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=310–311}} Information was also funneled to US ambassadors and Congresspeople. The US Congress in 1954 was among the few [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican controlled]] Congresses in many years. Republicans sought to use an anti-communist push to generate support for themselves and to erode the voting base of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]]. Anti-Communist members of the US Congress, such as [[Charles J. Kersten]] and [[Patrick J. Hillings]] of the [[Kersten Committee]], enthusiastically involved themselves with PBHistory.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=313–314}} By August 1954, Kersten was receiving PBHistory documents from Dulles so he could use them in speeches to Congress about the Soviet Union's influence in Guatemala.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=315}} In September and October 1954, the Kersten Committee held hearings purportedly investigating the penetration of communist influence. PBHistory documents were used in this process, and Castillo Armas became the first head of state to testify before a US Congress committee (although he did so through the use of a tape recording of his testimony).{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=316}} Although the hearings did little to unearth information about communist presence in Guatemala, they provided Operation PBHistory with huge publicity within the US.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=316}}

At the same time, the involvement of the Kersten committee and of Kersten and Hillings caused concern for the CIA. Dulles constantly worried that their investigation would damage CIA operations, particularly when Hillings visited Guatemala shortly before PBSuccess was to begin.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=315}} Congresspeople had not officially been informed of the CIA's role in the coup, and Dulles wished to keep them uninformed. By supplying them with PBHistory documents, Dulles hoped to forestall them from inadvertently exposing the CIA's other projects.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=315}} Following the hearings, a subcommittee headed by Hillings produced a final report. In addition to stating without evidence that the Guatemalan government had been acting under orders from the Soviet Union, this report falsely claimed that Soviet weapons had been brought covertly to Guatemala by submarine.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=317}} This unintentionally drew attention to [[Operation Washtub (Nicaragua)|Operation Washtub]], a CIA effort to foist incriminating weapons on the Guatemalan government.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=317}}{{sfn|Rabe|2004}}

===Other uses===
Once the CIA had stopped using the documents for propaganda purposes, the agents in charge of PBHistory decided that the best use of the documents they had uncovered would be to record the growth of the communist movement in Guatemala. This research was undertaken by the US State Department's Office of Intelligence Research.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=319}} The OIR produced a 50-page report after five months of work; the State Department considered it the "definitive answer" to the question of how communism had arisen in Guatemala.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=319}} The government of Honduras, which had allowed its territory to be used as a "staging area" for the coup against Árbenz, also made use of the PBHistory papers to justify its position. It argued that it had been facing interference in its internal matters from communists in Guatemala.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=311}}

==Aftermath and analysis==
{{Further|Jacobo Árbenz#Later life}}
[[Max Holland]], analyzing PBHistory in 2004, wrote that although very few highly sensitive communist documents were found, the operation provided the CIA with its first detailed look at the development of a powerful communist movement. It also allowed them to set up a Guatemalan service that would work against the communists, and for these reasons, the CIA judged the operation to be a success.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=321}} Historian [[Kate Doyle]] stated that the documents uncovered by PBHistory allowed the CIA to create a register of suspected communists.{{sfn|Doyle|1997}} The documents were described by participants as an "intelligence goldmine"; the register that the CIA left with the Guatemalan security forces contained information on thousands of citizens.{{sfn|Doyle|1997}}

PBHistory documents were used for years afterward to discredit Árbenz (living in exile) and to counter Soviet propaganda about American imperialism in Guatemala.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=312}} When Árbenz moved to [[Montevideo]] in 1957, the CIA used the PBHistory documents to produce a biography of Árbenz that described him as a Soviet agent, in an attempt to prevent him from moving to Mexico, where opposition to Castillo Armas' regime was coalescing.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=312}} Nonetheless, Árbenz remained a symbol of principled resistance to the United States, helped in part by Soviet propaganda to that effect.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=312}} When some of the PBHistory documents were published, they received little attention in Latin America.{{sfn|Gunn|2008|pp=149–150}} Though PBSuccess was viewed positively within the US soon after it occurred, the violence perpetrated by the Guatemalan governments supported by the US in the 1970s and 1980s changed the perception of the coup among the US public.{{sfn|Gunn|2008|pp=149–150}}

Despite the report produced by the Office of Intelligence Research, by 1957 the CIA realized that its version of the history of the Árbenz government and the coup was not gaining traction. Books written by defenders of the Árbenz government, which were strongly critical of the US intervention, were generally better received. Nationalist Latin Americans were inclined to view the Castillo Armas government as a creation of the US.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=319}} As a result, the US government decided to allow [[Ronald Schneider (historian)|Ronald Schneider]], a historian who was in the process of completing his [[Ph.D]], to access the PBHistory archive. Schneider published ''Communism in Guatemala: 1944 to 1954'' in 1959. Later observers have stated that the publication may have been subsidized in some way by the CIA: both the [[Foreign Policy Research Institute]], where Schneider worked, and [[Frederick A. Praeger]], who published Schneider's book, received CIA funds.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=319}} Schneider stated in his book that the ''Comité'' was responsible for collecting the documents he accessed, but did not mention the CIA's role in funding the ''Comité'', nor did he explain how the documents came to the US.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=320}} Schneider's book did not rely on PBHistory material alone, but also on information that he gathered during a trip to Mexico and Guatemala in 1957.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=321}} The book was generally well received.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=319}}

The operation failed in its main purpose, which was to find evidence that the government of Árbenz was under Soviet control.{{sfn|Gunn|2008|pp=149–150}}{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=322}} A CIA report published on October 1, 1954, stated that "'very few' 'Communist damaging' documents had been found".{{sfn|Holly|Patterson|2003}} The US failed to persuade Latin Americans of its point of view on communism: most people viewed the reforms of the [[Guatemalan Revolution]] in a positive light, and even Schneider's account, described by Holland as a balanced portrayal, was unable to persuade the public that the Soviet Union was involved in the rise of Guatemalan communism.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=322}} Political scientist Jeremy Gunn, who was given access to the material collected by the operation, stated that it "found no traces of Soviet control and substantial evidence that Guatemalan Communists acted alone, without support or guidance from outside the country".{{sfn|Gunn|2008|pp=149–150}} Nothing useful was discovered with respect to international communism either.{{sfn|Doyle|1997}} In contrast, the Soviet government's portrayal was of a Guatemalan government that did not threaten the interests of the US, but which was nonetheless overthrown in order to protect the United Fruit Company. Over time, this description of the events became the favored one in Latin America.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=322}}

The Soviet narrative was further strengthened in 1957, when Castillo Armas was overthrown and replaced with a highly reactionary government which further rolled back the reforms of the 1944 revolution; the Eisenhower administration did not react to the coup in any significant way.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=322}} When [[Richard Nixon]], then US vice-president, visited Latin America in 1958, he encountered severe abuse wherever he went, even from people who were not communists or their sympathizers. PBHistory was also unable to change the strong resentment against the CIA that the Guatemalan coup had created.{{sfn|Holland|2004|pp=322–323}} Writing in 2008 Gunn compared PBHistory to a similarly unsuccessful attempt by the US to justify the [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]] after it had occurred.{{sfn|Gunn|2008|pp=149–150}}{{sfn|Rabe|2004}} Historian Mark Hove has written that "Operation PBHistory proved ineffective because of 'a new, smoldering resentment' that had emerged in Latin America over US intervention in Guatemala."{{sfn|Hove|2007|p=40}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2666">'''Phocaean red slip''' (PRS) is a category of ''[[terra sigillata]]'', or "fine" [[Ancient Roman pottery]] produced in or near the ancient city of [[Phokaia]] in Asia Minor. It is recognizable by its thin reddish slip over a fine fabric, often with occasional white (lime) inclusions. The main period of production is the late 4th century AD into the 7th century, contemporary to the later production of [[African red slip ware|African red slip]]. All forms are open bowls or dishes. Later forms have stamped decoration.

The most widely used typology was defined John Hayes in his book ''Late Roman Pottery'', where the ware is called "Late Roman C" according to the name given by [[Frederick Waagé]] in his publication of the [[Antioch]] excavations. The supplement to that volume established the name "Phocaean Red Slip". Hayes form 3 and Hayes form 10 are the most widely exported forms, appearing in the western Mediterranean and also in the British Isles.

== Biography ==

=== Training ===
The son of an engineer, he spent his youth in the port of [[Bordeaux]]. Reading [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k921268 ''La Cité grecque''] by [[Gustave Glotz]], pushed him towards literary studies: he was received in 1940 in the [[École normale supérieure]] de la rue d'Ulm then at the [[Agrégation in France|agrégation de lettres]] in 1944. A member of the [[French School at Athens]] from 1947 to 1952, he studied in Greece archaic statuary of [[Delos]] and excavated the site of [[Thasos]]. In 1955, under the direction of [[André Aymard]], he defended his major thesis, dedicated to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] - the minor one being dedicated to the Athenian poet [[Agathon]], under the direction of {{Interlanguage link multi|Louis Séchan|fr}}.
&lt;!--
=== Career ===
Il obtint ensuite un poste d'assistant à la Sorbonne puis à Lyon (1951). Il devint maître de conférences à l'université de Montpellier (1955) avant d'être nommé professeur, en 1957, à l'université de Besançon, où il demeura toute sa carrière. Il y gagna le surnom de « doyen rouge », en raison de son militantisme communiste. Il y créa en 1968 un Centre d'histoire ancienne, devenu ensuite une unité du [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] sous le nom d'« Analyses des formations sociales de l'Antiquité », puis l'Institut des sciences de l'Antiquité, et en 1970 le Groupe international de recherches sur l'esclavage antique.

[[Image:Pietro Colletta.jpg|thumb|right|Pietro Colletta.]]
'''Pietro Colletta''' (January 23, 1775 – November 11, 1831) was a [[Naples|Neapolitan]] [[general]] and [[historian]], entered the Neapolitan artillery in 1796 and took part in the campaign against the French in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cuoco|first1=Vincenzo|title=Historical Essay on the Neapolitan Revolution of 1799|date=2014|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-4945-3|page=XVI|url=https://books.google.com/?id=X0VRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR16&amp;lpg=PR16&amp;dq=Pietro+Colletta+Neapolitan+general#v=onepage&amp;q=Pietro%20Colletta%20Neapolitan%20general&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Colletta was born in [[Naples]].

On the entry of the [[France|French]] into the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the establishment of the [[Parthenopaean Republic]] (1799), Colletta adhered to the new government.  When the Bourbon king [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]] reconquered the city, Colletta was thrown into prison and only escaped the death penalty by means of judiciously administered bribes.  Turned out of the army, he became a [[civil engineer]].  When the Bourbons were expelled a second time in 1806 and [[Joseph Bonaparte]] seized the throne of Naples, he was reinstated in his rank and served in the expedition against the brigands and rebels of [[Calabria]].

In 1812, Colletta was promoted to general, and made director of roads and bridges.  He served under [[Joachim Murat]] and fought the [[Austria]]ns at the [[Battle of the Panaro]] in 1815.  On the restoration of Ferdinand, Colletta was permitted to retain his rank in the army, and was given command of the Salerno division.  At the outbreak of the revolution of 1820 the king called him to his councils, and, when the constitution had been granted, Colletta was sent to put down the separatist rising in [[Sicily]], which he did with great severity.

He fought in the constitutionalist army against the Austrians at [[Battle of Rieti|Rieti]] (March 7, 1821).  On the re-establishment of autocracy, he was arrested and imprisoned for three months by order of the Prince of Canosa, the chief of police and his particular enemy.  He would have been executed had not the Austrians intervened in his favour, and he was exiled instead to [[Brünn]] in [[Moravia]].  In 1823, he was permitted to settle in [[Florence]], where he spent the rest of his days engaged on his ''Storia del reame di Napoli''.

==Works==

His history (first published in 1834), which deals with the reigns of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] and Ferdinand IV (1734–1825), is still the standard work for that period, but its value is somewhat diminished by the authors bitterness against his opponents and the fact that he does not give chapter and verse for his statements, many of which are based on his recollection of documents seen, but not available at the time of writing.  Still, having been an actor in many of the events recorded, he is on the whole accurate and trustworthy.

See [[Gino Capponi]]'s memoir of him published in the ''Storia del reame di Napoli'' (2nd ed., Florence, 1848).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7741">'''Reijer Hooykaas''' (1 August 1906 in [[Schoonhoven]] – 4 January 1994 in [[Zeist]]) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] historian of science.  He along with [[Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis]] were pioneers in professionalizing the [[history of science]] in the Netherlands.  Hooykaas gave the prestigious [[Gifford Lectures]] at St. Andrews in 1975-77. [[H. Floris Cohen]] dedicated his historiographical text ''The Scientific Revolution'' ([[University of Chicago Press]], 1994) to Hooykaas; its section on [[religion]] deals primarily with Hooykaas.&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Religion in the English Speaking World'', 2001, page 61&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
He was born into a [[Calvinist]] family of [[silversmith]]s. Hooykaas studied chemistry and physics at the University of Utrecht graduating in 1933.  While teaching high school chemistry and working on his Ph.D., he published articles on the history of science and religion, which brought his abilities to the attention of other scholars.&lt;ref name="MO"&gt;[[Malcolm Oster]] ([[The Open University]]), Sep. 1999, ''[[The British Journal for the History of Science]]'', Vol. 32, No. 3, pp. 366–368&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946 he became the first to hold a history of science chair at a Dutch university. From 1946 to 1972 he was a professor at the Free University of Amsterdam ([[Vrije Universiteit]] Amsterdam). In 1959 he became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00000971 |title=R. Hooykaas (1906 - 1994) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impatience ==

Hooykaas's impatience with certain modern historical attitudes has been the object of respect and praise.  Fellow historian Malcolm Oster noted that Hooykaas was "personally irritated" by historians who conclude that early modern scientists with strong religious views must have had "some mental disorder." Examples of such scientists for Hooykaas are [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Robert Boyle]], and [[Isaac Newton]].&lt;ref name="MO"/&gt;

*"Science and Reformation", [[Journal of World History]], 3(1956): pp.&amp;nbsp;109–139.
:&lt;small&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; In this once-important article defending the Protestantism thesis, Hooykaas shows "how the religious attitude of so-called 'ascetic' Protestantism, which more or less stood under Calvin's influence, furthered the development of science." This article is an acknowledged summary of (and thus has been superseded by) [''Religion and the Rise of Modern Science'' (1972)]&lt;ref name=brooks/&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/small&gt;

:&lt;small&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; This book is a systematic and articulate attempt to show the philosophical as well as sociological connections between science and Protestantism in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Hooykaas tends to oversimplify when he categorizes "types" of Christianity and of philosophy. His own theological biases sometimes intrude. But the book remains important for anyone doing work in our field. It is excellent for an introductory discussion of the philosophical issues--and especially as regards the relation of the "voluntaristic doctrine of God" to early modern natural philosophy. Hooykaas examines continental as well as English Calvinists and considers why and how they believed science should be cultivated: (1) to the glory of God and to the benefit of humankind; (2) empirically, in spite of human authorities; and (3) by using our hands. The book is a veritable mine of relevant biblical texts.&lt;ref name=brooks/&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/small&gt;

Hooykaas describes well Boyle's voluntartistic dotrine of God, his religious motivation and his justification for doing natural philosophy.&lt;ref name=brooks/&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/small&gt;

After lecturing in [[Population study|population studies]] at [[University of Plymouth|Plymouth Polytechnic]] for a year, Smith took up an assistant [[Lecturer|lectureship]] in [[historical geography]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] from 1974 to 1976. He then joined the [[Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure]] and was its assistant director for two years from 1981 to 1983. He also joined [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge]], as a [[fellow]] in 1977, but left in 1983 to take up a fellowship at [[All Souls College, Oxford]]; while at All Souls, he was also, initially, a lecturer in [[Demographic history|population history]] at the [[University of Oxford]] until 1989, when he took up a [[Reader (academic rank)|readership]] and the directorship of the [[Wellcome Unit for the History of Medicine]] at Oxford. He left Oxford in 1994, when he was elected a fellow of [[Downing College, Cambridge]], and appointed director of the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure. From 2003 to 2011, he was also professor of historical geography and demography, and was head of the Department of Geography at Cambridge from 2007 to 2010; he retired from his fellowship in 2010 (having been vice-master of Downing College for six years) and from the Group two years later.&lt;ref name="WhWaWh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prof"&gt;[https://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/people/smith/ "Richard M.

'''Tao''' ({{lang-ka|ტაო}}) is a historical [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] district and part of historic [[Tao-Klarjeti (historical region)|Tao-Klarjeti]] region, today part of the [[Eastern Anatolia Region, Turkey|Eastern Anatolia]] region of [[Turkey]]. Its name derives from the ancient proto-Georgian inhabitants of this area, known as [[Taochi]].&lt;ref name="Suny1994"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=riW0kKzat2sC&amp;pg=PA6|title=The Making of the Georgian Nation|author=Ronald Grigor Suny|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20915-3|pages=6–|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===
The history of Tao could be traced to the emergence of the tribal confederation of [[Diauehi|Diauchi]] (Taochi, Tao) at 12–8th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;G. Kavtaradze. "The Ancient Country of Taokhians and the Beginnings of Georgian Statehood". "Language and Culture". N5-6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Diauchi was engaged in war with the powerful kingdom of [[Urartu]], and the inscriptions of the Urartu kings [[Menua]] ({{Circa}} 810–786 BC) and [[Argishti I of Urartu|Argishti]] ({{Circa}} 786–764) reveal the wealth and power of this proto-Georgian kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Sagona. ''Archaeology at the North-East Anatolian Frontier'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8th century BC, Diauchi was destroyed by the neighboring [[Colchis]] and Urartu and part of its territory was annexed by the Colchis. In the 4th-3rd centuries BC region was organized into a province of the [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberian Kingdom]]. 

The region was bitterly contested by the Georgian and Armenian rulers throughout the following centuries. In the 4th and 5th centuries AD, following the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]–[[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] partition of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] in 387, Tao came under Persian influence, and its western border ([[Iberian Gates|Iberian gates]]) served as aboundary between the two empires. Tao or [[Tayk]] was one of the nine districts forming the territory of the Armenian kingdom of [[Arshak III]]. Tao at that period was a principality, the ancestral domain of the [[Mamikonian|Mamikonid]] clan. In the 6th century, the Byzantines took control over Tao. Once the Mamikonians had disappeared from the scene, the [[Bagrationi dynasty|Bagratids]] began their ascendancy. 

=== Middle Ages ===
Medieval Georgian sources recorded the Upper (southwest) Tao and Lower (northwest) Tao, of which the former was in [[Bagrationi dynasty|Bagratid]] possession while the latter was ruled by the [[Guaramid dynasty|Guaramid House]]. By the late 8th century, The Bagrationi family had grown in prominence by the time the [[Kingdom of Iberia|Caucasian Iberia]] fell to the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid Empire]] in the 6th century, and the leading local princely families were exhausted by [[Caliphate|Arab]] attacks. The rise of the new dynasty was made possible by the extinction of the Guaramids and the near-extinction of the [[Chosroid dynasty|Chosroids]], and also by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] preoccupation with their own civil wars and conflict with the [[Byzantine Empire]].  

=== Princedom ===
The new era began in [[Tao-Klarjeti (historical region)|Tao-Klarjeti]] in 813, when the last Iberian prince [[Ashot I of Iberia|Ashot I]] of the [[Bagrationi dynasty]] moved to [[Klarjeti]] and made it a base in his struggle against the [[Arab rule in Georgia|Arab occupation]]. Recognizing the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] suzerainty, he received a title of [[Kouropalates|Curopalate]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: κουροπαλάτης) and established the [[Principality of Tao-Klarjeti|Kouropalatate of Iberia]]. The Bagrationi family eventually took control of both Upper and Lower Tao and gradually expanded its sphere of influence. He encouraged resettlement of Georgians in these lands, and patronized monastic life initiated by the prominent Georgian ecclesiastic figure [[Gregory of Khandzta|Grigol Khandzta]] (&lt;abbr&gt;c.&lt;/abbr&gt; 759–861). For a long time the region became a [[Culture of Georgia (country)|cultural]] [[Safe house|safe-house]] and one of the most important [[Georgian Orthodox Church|religious]] centers of Georgia.

In the second half of the 10th century, Tao became a large and powerful principality during the rule of [[David III of Tao]]. The growth and consolidation of this principality contributed to the expansion of Georgian cultural and economic ties with other kingdoms and principalities. The might of the principality was clearly demonstrated in 979, when Byzantine Emperor [[Basil II]], facing a large rebellion of [[Bardas Skleros|Bardas Scleros]] (976–979), appealed for help to David III. Georgian expeditionary corps under the [[Tornike Eristavi|John Tornikios]] defeated the insurgents and restored the emperor’s authority. Throughout his reign, David Curopalates pursued his grand design of the [[Kingdom of Georgia#Unification of the Georgian State|unification of Georgia]]. Supported by Ioane Marushisdze, the powerful duke of [[Principality of Iberia|Iberia (Kartli)]], he succeeded in having his adopted son [[Bagrat III of Georgia|Bagrat]] placed on the throne of [[Kartli]] in 975 and of [[Kingdom of Abkhazia|Abkhazia]] in 978.
[[File:Caucasus 1213 AD map en.svg|thumb|Kingdom of Georgia under [[Tamar of Georgia|Queen Tamar]]'s reign.]]
Following David III’s death in 1001, his domain was inherited by emperor of Byzantine Basil II, these provinces were organized into the [[Iberia (theme)|theme of Iberia]] with the capital at [[Erzurum|Theodosiopolis]], forcing the successor Georgian Bagratid ruler [[Bagrat III of Georgia|Bagrat III]] to recognize the new rearrangement. Bagrat’s son, [[George I of Georgia|George I]], however, inherited a longstanding claim to David’s succession. Young and ambitious, George launched a campaign to restore the Kuropalates’ succession to Georgia and occupied Tao in 1015–1016. Byzantines were at that time involved in a relentless war with the [[First Bulgar Empire|Bulgar Empire]], limiting their actions to the west. But as soon as [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|Bulgaria was conquered]], [[Basil II]] led his army against Georgia (1021). An exhausting war lasted for two years, and ended in a [[Battle of Svindax|decisive Byzantine victory]], forcing George to agree to a peace treaty, in which he had to abandon his claims to Tao.

After the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071 the Seljuk advance forced the Byzantines to evacuate the eastern [[Anatolia]], in 1072-1073 the Georgian governor of ''[[Iberia (theme)|theme of Iberia]],'' [[Gregory Pakourianos]] ceded control over Tao to King [[George II of Georgia]]. Over the next five centuries, Tao was an integral part of the [[Kingdom of Georgia]]. The medieval [[Tsitsishvili|House of Panaskerteli]], who derived their name from the [[Panaskerti|castle of Panaskerti]] came into prominence with [[Zakaria of Panaskerti]], who together with some other nobles, put down in 1192 the revolt against Queen [[Tamar of Georgia]] and were eventually enfeoffed with the duchy of Tao. His descendant, T'aqa Panaskerteli, Duke of Tao, defeated the [[Turkmens|Turkomans]] invading Georgia in about 1302 at [[Tortum|Tortomi]] Castle.&lt;ref name="traditio"&gt;[[Toumanoff, Cyril]]. "The Fifteenth-Century Bagratids and the Institution of Collegial Sovereignty in Georgia." ''Traditio'' 7 (1949–51): 184-185&lt;/ref&gt; Tao was later placed within principality of [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]], ruled by the [[House of Jaqeli]]. 

=== Modern history ===
In 1545 region was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]], which retained it for the centuries. After the [[Georgia within the Russian Empire|Russian annexation of Georgia]] in 1801, the region was contested between [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and the Ottoman Empire in a [[History of the Russo-Turkish wars|series of wars]] throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. After the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878]], one part of Tao, now designated as [[Yusufeli]] and [[Oltu]] districts, were ceded to the Russian Empire and incorporated into [[Batum Oblast|Batum]] and [[Kars Oblast]], while most part of historical Tao were secured by Ottomans, as part of [[Erzurum Vilayet]]. However, the Russian territorial gains in Tao were reversed in the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] between Ottoman Turkey and [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevik Russia]] in 1918. Although the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] briefly regained its control of the region in 1919–1920, the subsequent invasion of the Red Army in 1921 led to the territorial partition of Georgia in which Turkey received the provinces of Tao and Klarjeti. 

Today Tao is within the boundary of modern-day [[Turkey]]. Armenian residents were largely forced out of the region during the early 20th century, but the Georgian populace remains. More importantly, the region contains numerous Georgian historical monuments, notably the churches and monasteries of [[Ishkhani]], [[Bana cathedral|Bana]], [[Doliskana]], [[Parkhali]], [[Khakhuli Monastery|Kakhuli]], [[Oshki]], [[Otkhta]] and others. Recent study has found most of the surviving monuments in satisfactory condition, but some have been vandalised and immediate conservation and renovation is urgently needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9631">The '''Thurian Age''' is a specific epoch in the fictional timeline used by [[Robert E. Howard]] in his [[Kull of Atlantis|Kull]] stories. It predates the [[Hyborian Age]] of the [[Conan the Barbarian]] stories and is known to them as the ''Pre-Cataclysmic Age''.&lt;ref name="hyborianage"&gt;''[[The Hyborian Age]]'' by [[Robert E. Howard]] (1936)&lt;/ref&gt; The main continent is called '''Thuria''', although smaller continents such as Atlantis and an unnamed Eastern continent exist, as do several island chains. Most of the planet is unexplored wilderness inhabited by "scattered clans and tribes of primitive savages."&lt;ref name="hyborianage" /&gt; The boundary between the two ages is marked by the "Great Cataclysm," which might have taken place as early as ca. 35,000 to 40,000 B.C, or as recently as 18,000 B.C. depending on the sources considered. When Robert E. Howard began to chronicle the adventures of Conan the Cimmerian, in the early 1930s, he prepared a fictional history of the Hyborian Age which he had created. That "history" dealt not only with the period during and after Conan's life, but also with events some eight thousand years earlier, during the Thurian civilization which produced King Kull, exiled warrior of Atlantis in the days before that continent sank into the surging seas.

A great cataclysm ends the Thurian Age some time after the Kull stories. Several countries sink into the sea, others rise from it, and the rest is devastated by earthquakes and volcanoes. Civilization is destroyed and the survivors attempt to build a new culture but warfare and a Lesser Cataclysm strike, creating the Hyborian ''Vilayet Sea'' and destroying any last remnants of Thurian society.&lt;ref name="hyborianage" /&gt;

== Dominant kingdoms ==
Six kingdoms dominate the main continent of Thuria: Valusia, Kamelia, Commoria, Grondar, Thule, and Verulia. All share a common language and possibly a common origin. East of these kingdoms is a vast desert. The six kingdoms are all part of the "Seven Empires" although the seventh member is never named.

Following the Cataclysm, one of the kingdoms (not Valusia), become the [[Zhemri]] people who eventually form the land of Zamora (the people of which in turn eventually become the [[Romani people]]).

=== Commoria ===
{{Expand section|a description of Commoria|date=July 2007}}
They are described as having wars with Valusia&lt;ref name="hyborianage" /&gt; but it does not appear in the Kull stories.

=== Grondar ===
The kingdom furthest to the east of the Thurian continent, bordering the eastern desert. Its people are less cultured than those of the other kingdoms.&lt;ref name="hyborianage" /&gt;

In an untitled draft in ''Kull- Exile of Atlantis'', Grondar is 1) described as being east of Zarfhaana and having a wasteland, 2) occasionally sending out raiders into the grass savannah that separates it from its western neighbors, 3) Thurania is a named target of these raids, 4) the ancestors of the Grondarans came from somewhere unknown and defeated an older people who inhabited the land now known as Grondar (the remains of the original inhabitants' cities lie in the grass savanah between Grondar and the western kingdoms), and 5) hinted that Grondar didn't have cities similar to those of the west.&lt;ref name="Atlantis' 2006"&gt;''Kull of Atlantis'' by Robert E. Howard (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kamelia ===
{{Expand section|a description of Kamelia|date=July 2007}}

=== [[Thule]] ===
{{Expand section|a description of Thule|date=July 2007}}

The name Thule comes from Classical mythology (or pseudo-geography). First described by [[Greeks|Greek]] explorer [[Pytheas]], it is a mysterious land to the north. It has been associated with [[Scandinavia]] and [[Iceland]].

=== Valusia ===
The kingdom furthest to the west of the Thurian continent.&lt;ref name="hyborianage" /&gt; This kingdom was created and initially ruled by the [[Serpent Men]], until they were overthrown by their human slaves. They attempted to control the new human kingdom of Valusia from behind the scenes, using illusionary magic, when mankind's memories of the past wars faded. However, the Serpent Men were again defeated in a secret war. Finally they created a religion, the Snake Cult, to do the same thing again and almost succeeded. Their power was, however, eventually destroyed by [[Kull of Atlantis|Kull]], an Atlantean barbarian who had gained the crown of Valusia by force.&lt;ref name="shadow"&gt;''[[The Shadow Kingdom]]'' by [[Robert E. Howard]] (1929)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kull notes, in ''[[The Shadow Kingdom]]'', how the Valusia of his time is a fading and degenerate country, "living mostly in dreams of bygone glory, but still a mighty land and the greatest of the Seven Empires". The kingdom is already ancient by his standards: "The hills of Atlantis and Mu were isles of the sea when Valusia was young."&lt;ref name="shadow" /&gt;

== Barbarian societies ==
There are three main barbarian societies in the Thurian Age.&lt;ref name="hyborianage" /&gt;

=== [[Atlantis]] ===
{{see| Atlantis}}

A small continent to the west of Thuria and east of the Pictish Islands. They have colonies on Thuria itself.

Atlantis is an old enemy of the "Seven Empires" (see Dominant Kingdoms) of Thuria and has an even more ingrained enmity of the Picts.&lt;ref name="shadow" /&gt;

Following a cataclysm which destroyed the Thurian Age, Atlantis sinks beneath the sea. The survivors on the Thurian continent are forced back into the Stone Age by lack of resources, but become skilled in this medium and develop an artistic culture. They soon enter a war with the surviving Picts and lost to their superior numbers and Stone Age military technology. The survivors of the war devolve back into apes. They eventually re-evolve into humans and became the [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmerians]] of the [[Hyborian Age]]. In turn, the Cimmerians become the [[Celts]], [[Gaels]], and [[Scythians]] of modern history.

=== [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] ===
Lemuria is a chain of large islands east of Thuria.

Following the cataclysm which ended the Thurian age, these islands sank into the sea. The surviving Lemurians escaped into the east coast of the Thurian continent and were enslaved by an unnamed pre-human race. After enduring more than a thousand years of brutal slavery, the Lemurians were reduced to a state of savagery. The Lemurians eventually rose up and destroyed their masters, the survivors of whom escaped to the south of Thuria and created the kingdom of [[Stygia (Conan)|Stygia]].

The Lemurians eventually became the Hyrkanians of the Hyborian Age and formed the country of Turan on the edge of the Vilayet Sea. The Hyrkanians played a part in destroying a Hyborian civilization during an unspecified era after the Conan stories. The stories assert they eventually became the [[Tatars]], [[Huns]], [[Mongols]], and [[Turkish people|Turks]] of the modern age.&lt;ref name="hyborianage" /&gt;

=== Pictish Islands ===
A chain of islands in the far west of Thuria and Atlantis. Due to raiding expeditions, they have colonies on Thuria itself. The Picts have an ancient feud with the Atlanteans.

After the cataclysm, the Pictish Islands rose to form the mountains of what would be the [[Americas]]. The Picts of the islands would become the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. The Picts of Thuria fell further into barbarism but remained stable, neither evolving or devolving as other societies had. At first their society held, despite reverting to the stone age, but a war with the surviving Atlanteans halted any advancement they would have made. They would become the savage Picts of the ''Pictish Wilderness'' on the west coast of the Hyborian kingdoms in the [[Conan the Barbarian]] stories&lt;ref name="hyborianage" /&gt; and the more degenerate [[Picts]] of Britain in the [[Bran Mak Morn]] stories&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kings of the Night]]'' by [[Robert E. Howard]]&lt;/ref&gt; and real history.

== Other kingdoms ==
Another mysterious kingdom lies on the east coast of the Thurian continent. They have some contact with Lemuria but come from another continent entirely to the east of the Lemurian islands.&lt;ref name="hyborianage" /&gt;

The Kull novel ''The Shadow Kingdom'' refers in passing to two other countries, Mu and Kaa-u.&lt;ref name="shadow" /&gt; Mu sinks during a cataclysm and its mountains become the islands of the [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]].&lt;ref name="eons"&gt;''[[The Isle of the Eons]]'' by [[Robert E. Howard]] (unfinished fragment)&lt;/ref&gt;

An untitled draft in the "Kull of Atlantis" stories mentions 3 other nations: Farsun (an enemy of Thurania, located west of Valusia), Zarfhaana (east of Valusia, the Camoonian Desert separates the two and there is a sea to the north of Zarfhaana), and Thurania (south of Zarfhaana, enemy of Farsun).&lt;ref name="Atlantis' 2006"/&gt;

== Pre-human societies ==
There are other "equally civilized" but non-human kingdoms. The citizens were of one or more older, pre-human races. One such mysterious pre-human civilization exists at the south of Thuria, this country is, at first, untouched by the Cataclysm. When the oppressors of the Lemurians are overthrown, however, the survivors escape to this region and destroy it in turn, creating the new country of [[Stygia (Conan)|Stygia]].&lt;ref name="hyborianage" /&gt;

The following is a '''timeline of the first premiership of Winston Churchill''', who was the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955. Churchill served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during the bulk of World War II. His speeches and radio broadcasts helped inspire British resistance, especially during the difficult days of 1940&amp;ndash;41 when the British Commonwealth and Empire stood almost alone in its active opposition to [[Nazi Germany]]. He led Britain as Prime Minister until victory over Nazi Germany had been secured. for the general history see [[Timeline of the United Kingdom home front during World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;The main sources here are ''Facts on file yearbook'' (compilation of weekly reports) and ''Keesing's Contemporary Archives'' (monthly reports), both online.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] lost the 1945 election, Churchill became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] to the Labour Government. He would go on to be re-elected as Prime Minister in 1951.

=== April ===
* {{Timeline-event |date={{Start date|1942|04|14|df=y}} |event= [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]], concerned that the situation in Malta will cause the Axis forces in North Africa to be better supplied than British forces, sends a telegram to [[Sir Stafford Cripps]] in Cairo, asking him to pressure [[Claude Auchinleck|General Auchinleck]] to take offensive action before this can occur.}}
* {{Timeline-event |date={{Start date|1942|04|20|df=y}} |event= [[William Dobbie|General Dobbie]], Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief of [[Malta]], sends a message to [[Winston Churchill|the PM]] saying "it is obvious that the very worst may happen if we cannot replenish our vital needs, especially flour and ammunition, and that very soon...." Churchill concludes from this and other "disturbing news" that Dobbie is not capable enough for such an important job, and decides to replace him with [[Lord Gort]].}}

=== May ===
* {{Timeline-event |date={{Start date|1942|05|09|df=y}} |event= On the night of 8-9 May 1942, gunners of the [[Ceylon Garrison Artillery]] on Horsburgh Island in the Cocos Islands rebelled. Their mutiny was crushed and three of them were executed, the only British Commonwealth soldiers to be executed for mutiny during the Second World War.&lt;br&gt;USS Wasp and HMS Eagle deliver a second contingent of Spitfires to Malta in [[Operation Bowery]]. A few days later, a grateful Churchill will signal Wasp "Who says a Wasp can't sting twice?" These aircraft, employed more aggressively than those previously delivered, turn the tide in the skies over Malta during the next few days, and the Axis is forced to abandon daylight bombing. This is a major turning point in the Siege, and thus in the North African Campaign, although the approaches to the island remain subject to deadly and accurate Axis air attack, preventing efficient re-supply of the island.}}
* {{Timeline-event |date={{Start date|1942|05|10|df=y}} |event=10: Churchill, growing ever more frustrated with [[General Auchinleck]]'s inactivity, finally sends him a telegram with a clear order; attack in time to cover for the Harpoon/Vigorous convoys to Malta during the dark of the moon in early June. This places Auchinleck in the position of complying or resigning. Auchinleck does not immediately reply, leaving Churchill, CIGS, and the War Cabinet in a state of suspense.}}
* {{Timeline-event |date={{Start date|1942|05|17|df=y}} |event= It has been a week since Churchill sent his ultimatum to [[General Auchinleck]], and he has not yet received a reply. He sends a terse follow-up: "It is necessary for me to have some account of your general intentions in light of our recent telegrams." Again there is no immediate reply. }}
* {{Timeline-event |date={{Start date|1942|05|19|df=y}} |event= [[General Auchinleck]] at last replies to Churchill's somewhat urgent telegram of the 10th, saying he will have an attack ready by the sailing of the Harpoon/Vigorous convoys for Malta.}}
* {{Timeline-event |date={{Start date|1942|05|21|df=y}} |event= In discussions with Winston Churchill and [[Anthony Eden]], Molotov continues to press Soviet demands for territorial acquisitions made during the run-up to war, including the Baltic states, Eastern Poland, and Bessarabia. Churchill cannot or will not agree to these demands, and the talks become deadlocked.}}

=== June ===
* {{Timeline-event |date={{Start date|1942|06|14|df=y}} |event= At the [[Gazala Line]], the British position has become untenable, and General Auchinleck authorizes General Ritchie to make a concerted withdrawal from forward positions along the line. &lt;br&gt; 1st South African Division is able to withdraw along the coastal road, but the road cannot accommodate all the troops at once, and this route in any event is under threat of being cut by [[Rommel]]'s forces; so troops including 50th Division must first breakout to the southwest, through the area occupied by Italian X Corps, and then turn east to rejoin 8th Army. This somewhat daring operation is concluded successfully. The RAF forces available, although outnumbered, make a valiant effort to cover the retreat. Churchill sends [[General Auchinleck|Auchinleck]] a telegram beginning, 'To what position does Ritchie want to withdraw the Gazala troops? Presume there is no question in any case of giving up Tobruk.' &lt;br&gt; The convoy 'Vigorous', en route to Malta, sights a large Italian naval squadron headed toward it. 'Harpoon' comes under attack for the first time; 'Vigorous' has been under air attack almost since leaving port. }}
* {{Timeline-event |date={{Start date|1942|06|15|df=y}} |event = [[General Auchinleck]] sends Churchill a reply to the latter's telegram of the 14th, saying in part, "...I have no intention whatever of giving up Tobruk." }}

* {{Timeline-event |date={{Start date|1942|08|13|df=y}} |event= General Bernard Montgomery appointed commander of British Eighth Army in North Africa; Churchill is anxious to see more offensive action on the part of the British.}}

=== November ===
* {{Timeline-event |date={{Start date|1942|11|10|df=y}} |event= Montgomery begins a major British offensive beginning at Sollum on the Libya/Egypt border. The British reach [[Bardia]] on the 11th, [[Tobruk]] on the 12th, and [[Benghazi]] on the 18th. &lt;br&gt; Lieutenant [[General Montgomery]] is knighted and made a full General. Churchill speaks: "This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning."}}

'''Tsepon Wangchuk Deden Shakabpa''' ({{Bo|t=རྩིས་དཔོན་དབང་ཕྱུག་བདེ་ལྡན་ཞྭ་སྒབ་པ|w=rtsis dpon dbang phyug bde ldan zhwa sgab pa}}, January 11, 1907 – February 23, 1989) was a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] nobleman, scholar and former [[Finance Minister]] of the government of [[Tibet (1912–1951)|Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1hMvZvRAfwwC&amp;pg=PA318 A Saint in Seattle The Life of the Tibetan Mystic Dezhung Rinpoche]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
M. Shakabpa, was born in Tibet. His father,  Tashi Phuntsok Shakabpa, was the steward of Lhasa.  His uncle Trimon Norbu Wangyal, served as a Minister in the Cabinet of the [[13th Dalai Lama]]. Shakabpa joined the Government at the age of 23, in 1930, as an official of the Treasury, and was appointed Minister of Finance in 1939, a position he held until 1950. His uncle, who had participated in the [[Simla Accord (1914)|tripartite negotiations between Great Britain, China and Tibet]] in 1914, strongly encouraged him to take up an interest in Tibetan history, handing him in 1931 many documents he had personally collected from the Simla Accord negotiations,&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa, ''One Hundred Thousand Moons,'' BRILL, Vol.1, 2010 edited and translated by Derek F. Maher, Vol.1, p.xxxix&lt;/ref&gt; in order to counter the Chinese narrative accounts concerning his country.&lt;ref&gt;W. D. Shakabpa, ''One hundred thousand moons,'' p.xi.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tsepon Shakabpa with Lord Mountbatten in 1948.jpg|thumb|1948 meeting of Shakabpa and the last British [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy of India]], [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]]]]
Between late 1947 and early 1949, Shakabpa, in his capacity as Tibet's Finance Minister, was despatched abroad by the [[Cabinet (government)|Tibetan Cabinet]], or ''[[Kashag]],'' as head of a Tibetan [[Trade Mission]], a delegation that travelled around to world to investigate the possibilities of commercial treaties, particularly with the United States. He travelled to India, China, USA, England, France, Switzerland and Italy. The mission was intended also to strengthen claims for Tibet as an independent, sovereign nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tibetoffice.org/en/index.php?url_channel_id=8&amp;url_publish_channel_id=780&amp;url_subchannel_id=11&amp;well_id=2 SHAKABPA'S PASSPORT FOUND]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derek Maher, ibid. p.xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] argues that the official passport he was issued with at the time illustrates that  [[Tibet]] was an independent country.

As Chinese forces spilled over into [[Amdo]] and [[Kham]], Shakabpa and Tsechak Khenchung Tupten Gyelpo were appointed to serve as chief negotiators with the Chinese. The mission was aborted when the Tibetan cabinet minister in eastern Tibet, [[Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme|Ngapo Ngawang Jigme]], apparently arranged an agreement with the Chinese. When the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] entered Tibet in 1951, Shakabpa decided to go into exile, moving to India where, from 1959 until 1966, he was the principal representative of the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in New Delhi. It was from this time on that Shakabpa began to concentrate on a thorough study of Tibetan history.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Maher, ibid. p.xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

As events in Tibet deteriorated in the mid-fifties, he began to organise the [[Tibetan resistance]] together with the Dalai Lama's two older brothers, [[Gyalo Thondup]] and the [[Taktser Rinpoche]] also known as [[Thubten Jigme Norbu]].&lt;ref&gt;Maher, ibid. p.xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; After China's violent suppression of Tibetan demonstrations, and the flight into exile of the Dalai Lama and 80,000 Tibetans into exile, Shakabpa played a key role in developing the infrastructure for assisting the new [[diaspora]] in India. His major work, ''Tibet: A Political history,'' published by Yale University Press in 1967, has been judged 'the most thorough explication in a western language of a Tibetan's view of their history' down to recent times,&lt;ref&gt;Maher, ibid p.xv.&lt;/ref&gt; His perspective views the [[Tibet during the Ming Dynasty|historical relationship]] between China and Tibet as flowing from the model of preceptor and patron(''mchod gnas dang yon bdag'') established by [[Genghis Khan]], whereby 'the lama serv(ed) as the spiritual guide and preceptor of the khan, while the khan played the role of the protector and patron of the khan,'&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa, ibid. p.xli., ch.4 pp.199ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Tibet was 'forcibly incorporated into China under the threat of military destruction only in 1951'. This book, and in his more definitive account in Tibetan, published in 1976, have been subjected to a critique by Chinese Tibetologists.&lt;ref&gt;Maher, ibid.pp.xvii, xix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wáng  Guì  (王贵/王貴), Xǐráonímǎ  (喜饶尼玛/喜饒尼瑪), Táng jiāwèi  (唐家卫/唐家衛), 'Shakabpa's ''Political History'' and the Real History of Tibet,' (''Xiàgébā de 《Xīzàng zhèngzhì shǐ》yǔ xīzànglìshǐ de běnlái miànmù,'' (夏格巴的《西藏政治史》与西藏历史的本来面目),  Minzu chubanshe, Beijing 1996.(Tibetan translation: Gui Wang, Xiraonima, Jiawei Tang, ''Bod rang skyong ljongs "Bod kyi srid don rgyal rabs."

An English version is available in Wang Jiawei &amp; Nyima Gyaincain, ''The Historical Status of China's Tibet,'' China Intercontinental Press, 1997. This critique has in turn been reviewed by Derek F. Maher, 'An Examination of a Critical Appraisel of Tsepon Shakabpa's ''One Hundred Thousand Moons'',' in Gray Tuttle (ed.) ''The Rise of the Modern in Tibet,'' Beiträge zur Zentralasienforschung, International Institute for Tibetan and Buddhist Studies, Wissenschaftsverlag GmbH; Sankt Augustia, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakabpa lived in New Delhi, [[Kalimpong]] and Manhattan. He died of stomach cancer, at the age of 82, in 1989 in the house of one of his sons, [[Tsoltim Ngima Shakabpa]], in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]].

[[File:Passeportshakabpa.jpg|thumb|left|Shakabpa's passport]]
A photograph of Shakabpa's passport was first published in 1967 in his book ''Tibet: A Political History''. In 2003, this Tibetan passport was rediscovered in [[Nepal]] by Friends of Tibet (India) was presented to the XIV Dalai Lama in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article1975197.ece Crumpled passport ‘proves’ Tibet independence claim - Times Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Issued by the [[Kashag]] to Tibet's  finance minister Shakabpa for foreign travel, the passport was a single piece of pink paper, complete with photograph. It has a message in hand-written Tibetan and typed English, similar to the message by the nominal issuing officers of today's passports, stating that ""''the bearer of this letter – Tsepon Shakabpa, Chief of the Finance Department of the Government of Tibet, is hereby sent to China, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and other countries to explore and review trade possibilities between these countries and Tibet. We shall, therefore, be grateful if all the Governments concerned on his route would kindly give due recognition as such, grant necessary passport, visa, etc. without any hindrance and render assistance in all possible ways to him.''" The text and the photograph is sealed by a square stamp belonging to the Kashag, and is dated "''26th day of the 8th month of Fire-Pig year (Tibetan)''" (10 October 1947 in the gregorian calendar).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.friendsoftibet.org/mediaonfot/20040402a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The passport has received visa and entry stamps from several countries and territories, including India, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Switzerland, Pakistan, Iraq and Hong Kong, but not China. Some visa do reflect an official status, with mentions such as "Diplomatic courtesy, Service visa, Official gratis, Diplomatic visa, For government official".

The existence of this passport, which is believed to be genuine, is used by pro-Tibetan independence groups to demonstrate the recognised independence of Tibet in the mid 1900s.

[[Kurdistan Freedom Party]] (PAK) and [[Komalah]] expressed their support to the [[Kurdish separatism in Iran|Kurdish cause]] of PDKI as well, with both clashing with Iranian security forces in 2016 and 2017 respectively. In parallel, a leftist Iranian Kurdish rebel group PJAK resumed military activities against Iran in 2016, following a long period of stalemate.

The 2016 clashes came following a background of what PDKI described as "growing discontent in Rojhelat".&lt;ref name=mee&gt;{{cite web|author=Florian Neuhof |url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/forgotten-kurds-kurdistan-democratic-party-iran-iraq-986735140 |title=Iran's forgotten Kurds plot a comeback |publisher=[[Middle East Eye]] |date=2016-05-04 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commander of the PAK military wing described their engagement and declaration of hostilities against the Iranian government were due to the fact that "the situation in eastern Kurdistan ([[Iranian Kurdistan]]) has become unbearable, especially with the daily arbitrary executions against the Kurds [in Iran]".&lt;ref name=ara05&gt;{{cite web|author=Name * |url=http://aranews.net/2016/05/kurdish-rebels-attack-iranian-revolutionary-guards/ |title=Kurdish rebels attack Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Sardasht |publisher=[[ARA News]] |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{further|Kurds in Iran|Kurdish separatism in Iran|Mahabad riots|Kurdish nationalism}}

On November 3, eight Iranian border guards and a "large number of terrorists" were killed in a clash between Iranian security and PJAK militants according to Iranian sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2656848&amp;language=en |title=Eight Iranian guards killed near borders with Turkey - Military - 03/11/2017 |publisher=KUNA |date= |accessdate=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Iranian report indicated that among the killed Iranians - 5 were border guards and 3 were civil employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/iran/03112017|title=Clashes in northern Iran kill 8, including 5 border guards|publisher=|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Iranian semi-official Fars News agency, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Monday (December 4, 2017) that an Iranian border guard was killed and four others were injured in Maku, Iran, near the border with Turkey.&lt;ref name=rudaw06122017/&gt; Turkey claimed the attack was conducted by forces from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Daily Sabah also blamed the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK), the Iranian wing of the PKK.&lt;ref name=rudaw06122017/&gt; "The survivors sought help from the Turkish side and the injured were airlifted to hospitals here," reported Daily Sabah. "A soldier succumbed to his wounds at the hospital.&lt;ref name=rudaw06122017/&gt; The Turkish media agency reported the injured included "engineers working on an irrigation project" and "soldiers were providing security."&lt;ref name=rudaw06122017/&gt;

In early December 2017, 3 Kurdish smugglers were reported killed by Iranian security in Urmia Province according to Kurdish Hawar News, while another Kurdish smuggler was wounded in another incident in the Kaiman Bahurman village; In Zanjan province a Kurdish trader from Suqis was "seriously wounded," according to Hawar News.&lt;ref name=rudaw06122017&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/iran/061220171|title=Iranian regime forces, Kurds continue clashes near borders|publisher=|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018===
In early January the IRGC issued announcement on the death of three members of the force, after insurgent attack; the PDKI peshmerga claimed on the other hand of inflicting 6 fatalities on the IRGC during a clash in West Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/iran/060120182|title=Iran promises 'harsh' response for Kurdish groups after deadly border clashes|publisher=|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early March, two PDKI commanders were assassinated in Iraqi Kurdistan, with the Iranian [[Ministry of Intelligence]] accused by pro-PDKI sources of being behind the attacks.&lt;ref name="Assassination"/&gt;

In July, militants blew up an ammunition dump and killed eleven [[Iran]]ian [[Islamic Republic of Iran Border Guard Command|border guards]] stationed at an [[Iran–Iraq border]] post in [[Marivan County]]. Several militants were killed in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Militants kill 10 Iran Guards at Iraqi border post: agency |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-security-clash/militants-kill-10-iran-guards-at-iraqi-border-post-agency-idUSKBN1KB0DV |accessdate=23 July 2018 |work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On August 12, it was reported that 20 people were killed in heavy clashes between the IRGC and the PDKI.&lt;ref name=aawsat&gt;[https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1360876/iran-20-killed-clashes-between-irgc-kurdish-group]&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, the IRGC claimed of killing 10 Kurdish militants, not specifying its own casualties. PDKI claimed that its armed guerillas killed 12 IRGC troops, also not specifying their own casualties.&lt;ref name=aawsat/&gt;

On September 7th, the IRGC claimed killing 6 Kurdish militants at the vicinity of the Iraqi border, allegedly belonging to an organization responsible for the July attack.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-security-clash/irans-guards-say-they-killed-six-kurdish-militants-near-iraq-border-idUSKCN1LN2GS]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8th, the Iranian IRGC forces performed a missile attack on Kurdish party headquarters of PDKI and KDP-I in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], killing at least 11 people,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa-warning/iran-says-missile-attack-on-kurdish-dissidents-a-warning-to-hostile-powers-idUSKCN1LT2B8]&lt;/ref&gt; wounding 50 more.&lt;ref name=wp&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iran-guard-claims-missile-attack-on-separatist-kurds-in-iraq/2018/09/09/ba4db578-b41c-11e8-ae4f-2c1439c96d79_story.html?noredirect=on]&lt;/ref&gt; The weapons used were reportedly Fateh 110-bs with a 300km range. Iraqi Foreign Ministry issued a statement criticizing Iran’s attack, as harming Iraq's sovereignity.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

==Belligerents==
The Kurdish separatist movements of [[Kurdistan Freedom Party|PAK]] and [[Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan|KDPI]] were the first to initiate insurgency in the first half of 2016. In October 2016, [[Kurdistan Free Life Party|PJAK]] separately announced to resume its militant activities, which have largely been postponed since 2011 unilateral cease fire. On 23 October 2016, the leader of [[Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan|Komala]] party [[Abdullah Muhtadi]] called the movements of East Kurdistan to form a joint front in order to "merge their separate enclaves is necessary in order to face their common enemy—Iran".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/221020164 |title=Kurds urge unity against common enemy Iran |website=Rudaw.net |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Komalah officially announced initiation of militant activity in June 2017.

On behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the security forces involved in fighting include the Revolutionary Guards units, the [[Basij]] and the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Border Guard Command]].

==Foreign involvement==
Amidst of [[Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict]], Iranian authorities blame [[Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah|Saudi intelligence agency]] for supporting the unrest however Saudi officials deny involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-politics-kurds-idUSKCN11A0BD|title=To Iranian eyes, Kurdish unrest spells Saudi incitement |publisher=Reuters|date=4 September 2016|access-date=29 September 2016|author=Babak Dehghanpisheh|editor=William Maclean and Toby Chopra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[Stratfor]] analysis, [[Kurdistan Freedom Party|PAK]] and [[Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan|KDPI]] have appealed directly to [[Riyadh]] in their calls for funding and "countries with a vested interest in exacerbating Iran's domestic problems—such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Israel]]—may agree to help the Kurds". Saudi Arabia may have been providing financial support to all three Kurdish insurgent groups through its consulate in the [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], which is newly opened.&lt;ref name="stratfor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/iranian-kurds-return-arms|title=Iranian Kurds Return to Arms|publisher=[[Stratfor]]|date=29 July 2016|access-date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Worms''' ({{IPA-de|vɔʁms|lang}}) is a city in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Germany]], situated on the [[Upper Rhine]] about {{convert|60|km|mi|lk=off|sigfig=1|abbr=off}} south-southwest of [[Frankfurt-am-Main]]. It had approximately 82,000 inhabitants {{As of|2015|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="stla2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bevölkerung der Gemeinden am 31.Dezember 2015 - A1033_201522_hj_G.pdf|periodical=statistik.rlp.de|publisher=Rheinland Pfalz|url=http://www.statistik.rlp.de/fileadmin/dokumente/berichte/A/1033/A1033_201522_hj_G.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2017-11-27|last=Statistisches Landesamt|date=2015-12-31|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=15|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pre-Roman foundation, Worms was the capital of the [[Kingdom of the Burgundians]] in the early 5th century and hence the scene of the medieval legends referring to this period, notably the first part of the  ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''. 
Worms has been a Roman Catholic [[Prince-Bishopric of Worms|bishopric]] since at least 614,  and  was an important [[Count palatine|palatinate]] of [[Charlemagne]]. [[Worms Cathedral]] is one of the [[Imperial Cathedrals]] and among the finest examples of [[Romanesque architecture]] in Germany.  Worms prospered in the [[High Middle Ages]] as an  [[Imperial Free City]]. Among more than a hundred Imperial [[Diet (assembly)|Diets]] held at Worms, the  Diet of 1521 (commonly known as [[Diet of Worms|''the'' Diet of Worms]]) ended with the [[Edict of Worms]] in which [[Martin Luther]] was declared a [[heretic]]. Today, the city is an industrial centre and is famed as the origin of ''[[Liebfraumilch]]'' wine. Other industries include chemicals, metal goods and fodder.

==Geography==

===Geographic location===
Worms is located on the west bank of the river Rhine between the cities of [[Ludwigshafen]] and [[Mainz]].  On the northern edge of the city  the [[Pfrimm]] flows into the Rhine, and on the southern edge the [[Eisbach (Rhine)|Eisbach]] (English "Ice Stream"), flows into the Rhine.

===Boroughs===
Worms has 13 boroughs (or "Quarters") around the city centre. They are as follows:

===Climate===
The climate in the Rhine Valley is very temperate in winter and quite enjoyable in summer. Rainfall is below average for the surrounding areas.  Winter snow accumulation is very low and often melts quickly.

==History==

===Antiquity===
Worms was in ancient times a Celtic city named ''Borbetomagus'', perhaps meaning "water meadow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Etymologie.info|quote=damit der Bedeutung von 'Borbetomagus' = dt. 'Wasserwiese'|url=http://www.etymologie.info/~e/i_/it-__lo__.html|title=Etymologie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later it was conquered by the Germanic [[Vangiones]]. In 14 BC, Romans under the command of [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] captured and fortified the city, and from that time onwards a small troop of infantry and cavalry were garrisoned there. The Romans renamed the city as ''Augusta Vangionum'', after the [[Augustus|then-emperor]] and the local tribe. The name does not seem to have taken hold, however, and the German ''Worms'' developed from ''Borbetomagus''. The garrison grew into a small town with a regular Roman street plan, a forum, and temples for the main gods [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Minerva]] (whose temple was the site of the later cathedral), and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]].
[[File:Martinskirche Worms Portal.jpg|thumb|St Martin's Church.|left]]
Roman inscriptions, altars, and votive offerings can be seen in the archaeological museum, along with one of Europe's largest collections of [[Roman glass]]. Local potters worked in the town's south quarter. Fragments of amphoras contain traces of olive oil from [[Hispania Baetica]], doubtless transported by sea and then up the Rhine by ship.

During the disorders of 411–13 AD, the Roman usurper [[Jovinus]] established himself in Borbetomagus as a puppet-emperor with the help of King [[Gunther]] of the Burgundians, who had settled in the area between the Rhine and [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] some years before. The city became the capital of the Burgundian kingdom under Gunther (also known as Gundicar). Few remains of this early Burgundian kingdom survive, because in 436 it was all but destroyed by a combined army of Romans (led by [[Flavius Aetius|Aëtius]]) and Huns (led by [[Attila]]); a belt clasp found at Worms-Abenheim is a museum treasure. Provoked by Burgundian raids against Roman settlements, the combined Romano-Hunnic army destroyed the Burgundian army at the Battle of Worms (436), killing King Gunther. It is said that 20,000 were killed. The Romans led the survivors southwards to the Roman district of Sapaudia (modern day [[Savoy]]). The story of this war later inspired the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''.
The city appears on the [[Peutinger Map]], dated to the [[4th century]].

[[File:Worms 1630 P7160060.JPG|thumb|left|Map of Worms in 1630. The Jewish Ghetto is marked in yellow.]]
Worms has been a Roman Catholic [[Bishopric of Worms|bishopric]] since at least 614, with an even earlier mention in 346. In the [[Frankish Empire]], the city was the location of an important [[Count palatine|palatinate]] of [[Charlemagne]], who built one of his many administrative palaces here. The bishops administered the city and its territory. The most famous of the early medieval bishops was [[Burchard of Worms]].

[[Worms Cathedral]] (''Wormser Dom''), dedicated to [[Saint Peter|St Peter]], is one of the finest examples of [[Romanesque architecture]] in Germany. Alongside the nearby Romanesque cathedrals of [[Speyer Cathedral|Speyer]] and [[Mainz Cathedral|Mainz]], it is one of the so-called ''Kaiserdome'' ([[Imperial Cathedrals]]). Some parts in early Romanesque style from the 10th century still exist, while most parts are from the 11th and 12th century, with some later additions in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style (see the external links below for pictures).

Four other Romanesque churches as well as the Romanesque old city fortification still exist, making the city Germany's second in Romanesque architecture only to [[Cologne]].

Worms prospered in the [[High Middle Ages]]. Having received far-reaching privileges from King Henry IV (later [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry III]]) as early as 1074, the city later became an [[Imperial Free City]], being independent of any local ruler and responsible only to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] himself. As a result, Worms was the site of several important events in the history of the Empire. In 1122 the [[Concordat of Worms]] was signed; in 1495, an [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] met here and made an attempt at reforming the disintegrating [[Imperial Circle Estates]] by the [[Imperial Reform]].  Most important, among more than a hundred Imperial Diets held at Worms, that of 1521 (commonly known as ''the'' [[Diet of Worms]]) ended with the [[Edict of Worms]], in which [[Martin Luther]] was declared a [[heretic]] after refusing to recant his religious beliefs. Worms was also the birthplace of the first Bibles of the Reformation, both [[Martin Luther]]'s German Bible and [[William Tyndale]]'s first complete English New Testament by 1526.&lt;ref&gt;Teems, David. "Tyndale: The man who gave God an English voice." Nashville: Thomas Nelson  (2012).  Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city, known in medieval Hebrew by the name ''Varmayza'' or ''Vermaysa'' (ורמיזא, ורמישא), was a centre of medieval [[Ashkenazic]] [[Judaism]]. The Jewish community was established there in the late 10th century, and Worms's first [[synagogue]] was erected in 1034. In 1096, [[Worms massacre (1096)|eight hundred Jews were murdered]] by crusaders and the local mob. The [[Jewish Cemetery, Worms|Jewish Cemetery in Worms]], dating from the 11th century, is believed to be the oldest surviving ''in situ'' cemetery in [[Europe]]. The [[Worms Synagogue|Rashi Synagogue]], which dates from 1175 and was carefully reconstructed after its desecration on ''[[Kristallnacht]]'', is the oldest in Germany. Prominent students, rabbis, and scholars of Worms include [[Rashi|Shlomo Yitzhaki (Rashi)]] who studied with R. Yizhak Halevi, [[Eleazar of Worms|Elazar Rokeach]], Maharil, and [[Yair Bacharach]]. At the rabbinical synod held at Worms at the turn of the 11th century, Rabbi [[Gershom ben Judah]] (Rabbeinu Gershom) explicitly prohibited [[polygamy]] for the first time. For hundreds of years, until ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in 1938, the Jewish Quarter of Worms was a centre of Jewish life. Worms today has only a very small Jewish population, and a recognizable Jewish community as such no longer exists. However, after renovations in the 1970s and 1980s, many of the buildings of the Quarter can be seen in a close-to-original state, preserved as an outdoor museum.

===Modern era===

In 1689 during the [[Nine Years' War]], Worms (like the nearby towns and cities of [[Heidelberg]], [[Mannheim]], [[Oppenheim]], [[Speyer]] and [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]]) was sacked by troops of King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] of [[Kingdom of France|France]], though the French only held the city for a few weeks. In 1743 the [[Treaty of Worms (1743)|Treaty of Worms]] was signed, forming a political alliance between Great Britain, Austria and the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. In 1792 the city was occupied by troops of the [[French First Republic]] during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. The Bishopric of Worms was [[German mediatization|secularized]] in 1801, with the city being annexed into the [[First French Empire]]. In 1815 Worms passed to the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] in accordance with the [[Congress of Vienna]] and the city was subsequently administered within [[Rhenish Hesse]].

After the Battle of the Bulge, Allied Armies advanced into the Rhineland in preparation for a massive assault into the heart of the Reich.  Worms was a German strongpoint on the west bank of the Rhine and the forces there resisted the Allied advance tenaciously.  Worms was thus heavily bombed by the [[Royal Air Force]] in two attacks on Feb. 21 and March 18 1945. A post-war survey estimated that 39 per cent of the town's developed area was destroyed. The RAF attack on Feb. 21 was aimed at the main railway station on the edge of the inner city, and at chemical plants southwest of the inner city, but also destroyed large areas of the city centre. Carried out by 334 bombers, the attack in a few minutes rained 1,100 tons of bombs on the inner city, and Worms Cathedral was among the buildings set on fire.  The Americans did not enter the city until the Rhine crossings began after the seizure of the [[Ludendorff Bridge|Remagen Bridge]].

In the attacks, 239 inhabitants were killed and 35,000 (60 percent of the population of 58,000) were made homeless. A total of 6,490 buildings were severely damaged or destroyed. After the war, the inner city was rebuilt, mostly in modern style. Postwar, Worms became part of the new state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]; the borough Rosengarten, on the east bank of the Rhine, was lost to Hesse.

Worms today fiercely vies with the cities [[Trier]] and [[Cologne]] for the title of "Oldest City in Germany."  Worms is the only German member of the [[Most Ancient European Towns Network]].&lt;ref name="Members"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argos.gr/diktyoe.htm |title=diktyo |first= |last=MAETN |work=classic-web.archive.org |year=1999 |accessdate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051022022345/http://www.argos.gr/diktyoe.htm |archivedate=October 22, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Worms city council website"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worms.de/deutsch/kultur/wir_ueber_uns/Aelteste_Stadt.php |title=worms.de &amp;#62; Kultur &amp;#62; älteste deutsche Stadt |first= |last=Worms city council |work=worms.de |year=2011 |accessdate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719115700/http://www.worms.de/deutsch/kultur/wir_ueber_uns/Aelteste_Stadt.php |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A multimedia ''Nibelungenmuseum'' was opened in 2001, and a yearly festival right in front of the ''Dom'', the [[Worms Cathedral|Cathedral of Worms]], attempts to recapture the atmosphere of the pre-Christian period.

In 2010 the Worms synagogue was firebombed. Eight corners of the building were set ablaze, and a [[Molotov cocktail]] was thrown at a window. There were no injuries. [[Kurt Beck]], [[Minister-President (Germany)|Minister-President]] of Rhineland-Palatinate, condemned the attack and vowed to mobilize all necessary resources to find the perpetrators, saying, "We will not tolerate such an attack on a synagogue".&lt;ref name="Synagogue fire bombed"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/german-synagogue-arsonists-leave-the-palestinians-in-peace-1.290854| title=Worms synagogue fire-bombed| work=[[Haaretz]]| date=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
