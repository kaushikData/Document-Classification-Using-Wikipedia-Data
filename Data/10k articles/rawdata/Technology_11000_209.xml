'''Acetone peroxide''' is an [[organic peroxide]] and a [[primary explosive|primary]] [[high explosive]]. It is produced by the reaction of [[acetone]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]] to yield a mixture of linear [[monomer]] and [[Alicyclic compound|cyclic]] [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[Trimer (chemistry)|trimer]], and [[oligomer|tetramer]] forms. The trimer is known as '''triacetone triperoxide''' ('''TATP''') or '''tri-cyclic acetone peroxide''' ('''TCAP'''). The dimer is known as '''diacetone diperoxide (DADP)'''. Acetone peroxide takes the form of a white crystalline powder with a distinctive [[Sodium hypochlorite|bleach]]-like odor (when impure) or a fruit-like smell when pure and can explode if subjected to heat, friction, static electricity, concentrated sulfuric acid, strong UV radiation or [[Shock (mechanics)|shock]]. As a non-[[nitrogenous]] explosive, TATP has historically been more difficult to detect, and it has been used as an explosive in several [[Terrorism|terrorist]] attacks since 2001.

== History ==
Acetone peroxide (specifically, triacetone triperoxide) was discovered in 1895 by [[Richard Wolffenstein (chemist)|Richard Wolffenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{cite journal| first=R| last=Wolffenstein | name-list-format = vanc | title=Über die Einwirkung von Wasserstoffsuperoxyd auf Aceton und Mesityloxyd | trans-title = On the effect of hydrogen peroxide on acetone and mesityl oxide | language = German | journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft | volume=28 | issue=2 | pages= 2265–2269 | year=1895 | url = https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015026352040;view=1up;seq=1001 | doi = 10.1002/cber.189502802208}}  Wolffenstein determined that acetone peroxide formed a trimer, and he proposed a structural formula for it.  From pp. 2266–2267:  ''"Die physikalischen Eigenschaften des Superoxyds, der feste Aggregatzustand, die Unlöslichkeit in Wasser etc. sprachen dafür, dass das Molekulargewicht desselben ein grösseres wäre, als dem einfachen Atomverhältnisse entsprach.  … Es lag also ein trimolekulares Acetonsuperoxyd vor, das aus dem monomolekularen entstehen kann, indem sich die Bindungen zwischen je zwei Sauerstoffatomen lösen und zur Verknüpfung mit den Sauerstoffatomen eines benachbarten Moleküls dienen.  Man gelangt so zur folgenden Constitutionsformel:  ''[diagram of proposed molecular structure of the trimer of acetone peroxide]'' .  Diese eigenthümliche ringförmig constituirte Verbindung soll Tri-Cycloacetonsuperoxyd genannt werden."'' (The physical properties of the peroxide, its solid state of aggregation, its insolubility in water, etc., suggested that its molecular weight would be a greater [one] than corresponded to its simple empirical formula. … Thus [the result of the molecular weight determination showed that] there was present a tri-molecular acetone peroxide, which can arise from the monomer by the bonds between each pair of oxygen atoms [on one molecule of acetone peroxide] breaking and serving as links to the oxygen atoms of a neighboring molecule.  One thus arrives at the following structural formula:  [diagram of proposed molecular structure of the trimer of acetone peroxide] .  This strange ring-shaped compound shall be named "tri-cycloacetone peroxide".)

In 1899 [[Adolf von Baeyer]] and [[Victor Villiger]] described the first synthesis of the dimer and described use of acids for the synthesis of both peroxides.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Baeyer and Villiger prepared the dimer by combining [[potassium persulfate]] in [[diethyl ether]] with acetone, under cooling.  After separating the ether layer, the product was purified and found to melt at 132–133&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;(Baeyer and Villiger, 1899), p. 3632.&lt;/ref&gt;  They found that the trimer could be prepared by adding [[hydrochloric acid]] to a chilled mixture of acetone and [[hydrogen peroxide]].&lt;ref&gt;(Baeyer and Villiger, 1900), p. 859.&lt;/ref&gt;  By using the [[Freezing-point depression|depression of freezing points]] to determine the molecular weights of the compounds, they also determined that the form of acetone peroxide that they had prepared via potassium persulfate was a dimer, whereas the acetone peroxide that had been prepared via hydrochloric acid was a trimer, like Wolffenstein's compound.&lt;ref&gt;(Baeyer and Villiger, 1900), p. 859.  From p. 859:  ''"Das mit dem Caro'schen Reagens dargestellte, bei 132–133° schmelzende Superoxyd gab bei der Molekulargewichtsbestimmung nach der Gefrierpunktsmethode Resultate, welche zeigen, dass es dimolekular ist.  Um zu sehen, ob das mit Salzsäure dargestellte Superoxyd vom Schmp. 90–94° mit dem Wolffenstein'schen identisch ist, wurde davon ebenfalls eine Molekulargewichtsbestimmung gemacht, welche auf Zahlen führte, die für ein trimolekulares Superoxyd stimmen."''  (The peroxide that was prepared with Caro's reagent and that melted at 132–133°C gave — according to a determination of molecular weight via the freezing point method — results which show that it is dimolecular.  In order to see whether the peroxide that was prepared with hydrochloric acid and that has a melting point of 90–94°C is identical to Wolffenstein's, a molecular weight determination of it was likewise made, which led to numbers that are correct for a trimolecular peroxide.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on this methodology and on the various products obtained, was further investigated in the mid-20th century by Milas and Golubović.&lt;ref name = MilasGolubovic59&gt;{{cite journal | title = Studies in Organic Peroxides.

It was impossible to remove this substance by repeated recrystallization or sublimation.As we have found and published previously [23, 24] it is possible to reduce the amount of this substance by long-termthermal treatment at higher temperatures.&lt;/ref&gt; Under neutral conditions, the reaction is reported to produce the [[monomer]]ic [[organic peroxide]].&lt;ref name = MilasGolubovic59/&gt;

The product made by using hydrochloric acid is regarded as more stable than the one made using sulfuric acid. It is known that traces of sulfuric acid trapped inside the formed acetone peroxide crystals lead to instability. In fact, the trapped sulfuric acid can induce detonation at temperatures as low as 50&amp;nbsp;°C, this is the most likely mechanism behind accidental explosions of acetone peroxide that occur during drying on heated surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matyas|first=Robert|last2=Pachman|first2=Jiri| name-list-format = vanc |date=2007-07-01|title=Thermal stability of triacetone triperoxide|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279704800|journal=Science and Technology of Energetic Materials|volume=68|pages=111–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TATP/DADP, as well as [[Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine|HMTD]], belongs to the [[Mercury(II) fulminate|mercury fulminate]] group of primary explosives. This means that small, unconfined, samples (less than 2 g) tend to quickly burn ([[deflagration]]), while [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8kGJ3MYCMk larger] and/or properly confined samples detonate. This is sometimes demonstrated in chemistry classes. The experimenter may pour a small amount of acetone peroxide on his/her hand and light it on fire. This is strongly recommended against. The nature of deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) is probabilistic and even extremely small, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbetQqznT8 unconfined samples] may immediately [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH6wJfEo5wc detonate]! In any case, any direct contact of primary explosive with any part of the body breaks one of the cardinal safety rules for the safe handling of primary explosives!

The tetrameric form of acetone peroxide, prepared under neutral conditions using a [[tin(IV) chloride|tin]] catalyst in the presence of a [[chelator]] or general inhibitor of [[Radical (chemistry)|radical chemistry]], is reported to be more chemically stable, although still a very dangerous [[primary explosive]].&lt;ref name=jiang/&gt; It's synthesis has been disputed.&lt;ref name="Pachman, J. 2010"/&gt;

Both TATP and DADP are prone to loss of mass via [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]. DADP has lower [[Molecular mass|molecular weight]] and higher [[vapor pressure]]. This means that DADP is more prone to sublimation than TATP.

== Industrial uses ==
[[Ketone]]  peroxides, including acetone peroxide and [[methyl ethyl ketone peroxide]], find application as [[Radical initiator|initiator]]s for [[polymerization]] reactions, e.g., [[silicone]] or [[polyester]] [[resin]]s, in the making of [[fiberglass]]-reinforced composites.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} For these uses, the peroxides are typically in the form of a dilute solution in an organic solvent; methyl ethyl ketone is more common for this purpose, as it is stable in storage.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Acetone peroxide is used as a [[flour bleaching agent]] to bleach and "mature" flour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferrari CG, Higashiuchi K, Podliska JA | title = Flour Maturing and Bleaching with Acyclic Acetone Peroxides | journal = Cereal Chemistry | year = 1963 | volume = 40 | pages = 89–100 | url = http://www.aaccnet.org/publications/cc/backissues/1963/Documents/chem40_89.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acetone peroxides are unwanted by-products of some oxidation reactions such as those used in [[phenol]] syntheses.&lt;ref name=Costantini&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number= 5003109|status= |title= Destruction of acetone peroxide|pubdate=1991-03-26 |gdate= |fdate= |pridate= |inventor=Costantini, Michel |invent1= |invent2= |assign1= |assign2= |class= |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5003109.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their explosive nature, their presence in chemical processes and chemical samples creates potential hazardous situations.

==Sensitivity==
TATP, when fresh, is about as sensitive as an average primary explosive. DADP, when fresh, is slightly less sensitive than the average primary explosive. Older samples may contain larger crystals due to re-sublimation and larger crystals are generally more sensitive. However the experimental evidence behind this effect is contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wydawnictwa.ipo.waw.pl/cejem/vol-9-3-2012/Matyas.pdf|title=Study of TATP: Mass Loss and Friction Sensitivity During Ageing|last=Matyáš|first=Robert | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that the variance of friction force between different surfaces (e.g. different kinds of paper) is often greater than the variance between the friction sensitivity of a given pair of primary explosives. This leads to different values for friction sensitivity measured at different laboratories. Wet acetone peroxide is several times less sensitive to friction than dry acetone peroxide yet its impact sensitivity is almost the same as in the case of dry sample. Mixes with synthetic oil like [[WD-40]] are both less impact and friction sensitive than the dry sample. Water mixed with ethanol is even better.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wydawnictwa.ipo.waw.pl/cejem/vol-10-2-2013/Matyas.pdf|title=Decreasing the Friction Sensitivity of TATP, DADP and HMTD|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://energetics.chm.uri.edu/system/files/TATP1.2013.pdf|title=Factors Influencing Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP) and Diacetone Diperoxide (DADP) Formation: Part I|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sensitivity of mixes can not be (naively) predicted. One can expect, for example, that a mixture of TATP and [[ammonium nitrate]] is going to be less sensitive than pure TATP. The opposite is true (at certain ratios) since the sensitivity is affected by complex, mutual crystal interplay and hardness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matyáš|first=Robert|last2=Zeman|first2=Svatopluk|last3=Trzciński|first3=Waldemar|last4=Cudziło|first4=Stanisław|date=August 2008|title=Detonation Performance of TATP/AN-Based Explosives|journal=Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics|language=en|volume=33|issue=4|pages=296–300|doi=10.1002/prep.200700230|issn=0721-3115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TATP [[shockwave]] overpressure is 70% of that for TNT, the positive phase impulse is 55% of the TNT equivalent.

One can easily calculate moderately precise lethality distances for the resulting shockwave using Bass or Bowen equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ffi.no/no/Rapporter/2012%20-%2000539.pdf|title=Review of blast injury prediction models|last=Teland|first=Jan Arild| name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1&amp;nbsp;kg of TATP should produce 50% mortality at a distance of 1.2 m and near 99% mortality at a distance of about 0.9 m. 10&amp;nbsp;kg of TATP should produce 50% lethality at 3.2 m and 99% mortality at 2.5 m (distance between upper body and the center of explosion, person facing any direction). The lethality distances for a person that is directly facing the explosion are about 20 % higher. A crowded environment reduces these distances by about 1/3. This leads to about 700 g of TATP per 1 fatality for moderately crowded buses and trains from the shockwave effects alone.

The acceleration ability of loose TATP powder (0.3 - 0.5 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is rather poor. The volume energy of 0.4 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; TATP is about 1120 J/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, while the same parameter for cast TNT is about 6800 J/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This very roughly translates to typical fragment velocities of 0.5 – 1&amp;nbsp;km/s for loose 0.4 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; TATP charges and 1 – 2&amp;nbsp;km/s for charges made out of cast TNT.

TATP is attractive to terrorists because it is easily prepared from readily available retail ingredients, such as hair bleach and nail polish remover.&lt;ref name="nyt-isis" /&gt; It is also able to evade detection because it is one of the few high explosives that do not contain [[nitrogen]],&lt;ref name="mother of satan" /&gt; and can therefore pass undetected through traditional [[explosive detection]] scanners designed to detect nitrogenous explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feds are all wet on airport security |publisher=Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) |date=2006-08-24 |url=http://results.factiva.com/index/index.aspx?ref=NSL0000020060824e28o0001y |quote=At the moment, Watts said, the screening devices are set to detect nitrogen-based explosives, a category that doesn't include TATP |accessdate=11 September 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several detection devices for TATP have however now been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jacoby|first1=Mitch|title=Explosive used in Brussels isn't hard to detect|url=https://cen.acs.org/articles/94/web/2016/03/Explosive-used-Brussels-isnt-hard.html|accessdate=28 January 2018|work=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|date=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=det/&gt;

Large scale TATP synthesis is often betrayed by excessive bleach-like or fruity smell. This smell can even penetrate into clothes and hair in amounts that are quite noticeable. Such a person "smells like chemicals". This has been reported in the [[2016 Brussels bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Higgins|author2=Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura|title=In Brussels Bombing Plot, a Trail of Dots Not Connected|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/world/europe/in-brussels-bombing-plot-a-trail-of-dots-not-connected.html|accessdate=28 March 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accidents ==

TATP is a common source of injury among amateur chemists, particularly finger amputations. There is at least on the order of 3 and 10 recorded amputations in Slovakia and the US respectively, with possibly over 100 cases per year in Canada, Europe and the US combined.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.atf.gov/explosives/docs/report/2016-explosives-incident-report/download&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these injuries are caused by small amounts of TATP that inadvertently detonate (due to small, unexpected areas of high friction or static electricity sparks) in close proximity of fingers, since small amounts (1 - 3 grams) are generally not powerful enough to amputate fingers from distances larger than 5 – 10&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Stúpajúci trend podomáckej výroby výbušnin a udalosti s tým spojené, Kriminalistický a expertízny ústav Policajného zboru, p. 8 http://www.unms.sk/swift_data/source/dokumenty/skusobnictvo/upravy_2009/odborne_seminare_2008/KEU_BA_01_10_2008.pdf, written in Slovak&lt;/ref&gt; Direct contact between fingers and TATP is to be avoided for this reason.

[[Image:Annulus diagram for oil wells.jpg|200 px|right|Annulus]]
The '''annulus''' of an [[oil well]] or [[water well]] is any void between any piping, [[Production tubing|tubing]] or [[Casing (oil well)|casing]] and the piping, tubing, or casing immediately surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=annulus Oilfield Glossary: Term 'annulus'], retrieved 18 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is named after the corresponding [[Annulus (mathematics)|geometric concept]].  The presence of an annulus gives the ability to circulate fluid in the well, provided that excess [[drill cuttings]] have not accumulated in the annulus, preventing fluid movement and possibly sticking the pipe in the [[borehole]].

For a new well in the process of being drilled, this would be the void between the [[drill string]] and the formation being drilled.  An easy way to visualise this would be to stand a straw (purple in diagram) straight up in the center of a glass of water.  All of the water in between the straw and the sides of the glass would be the annulus (yellow area in diagram), with the straw itself representing the [[drill string]] and the sides of the glass representing the [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formation]].  While drilling, [[drilling fluid]] is pumped down the inside of the drill string and pushes the [[drill cuttings]] up the annulus to the surface, where the cuttings are removed from the [[drilling fluid]] ([[drilling mud]]) by the [[shale shakers]].

In a completed well, there may be many annuli.  The 'A' annulus is the void between the [[production tubing]] and the smallest [[Casing (oil well)|casing string]].  The 'A' annulus can serve a number of crucial tasks, including [[gas lift]] and [[well kill]]s.  A normal well will also have a 'B' and frequently a 'C' annulus, between the different casing strings.  These annuli do not normally have any connection to well bore fluids, but maintaining pressure in them is important in order to ensure integrity of the casing strings.

Though all annuli in a completed well are expected to be isolated from the [[production tubing]] and each other, connections allowing the flow of fluids between them may sometimes occur, due to either [[well intervention|intervention]] or wear and tear. There is said to be "communication" between these connected annuli.

During [[coiled tubing]] interventions, the void between the coil and the production tubing can also be considered an annulus and be used for circulation.

'''atm⁵''' is an [[interbank network]] in [[Singapore]], connecting the [[automated teller machine|ATMs]] of six of Singapore's eight [[List of banks in Singapore#Qualifying full banks|qualifying full banks]], QFB.  {{As of|2016}}, there are 230+ atm⁵ ATMs island-wide. The network was established in April 2005.

atm⁵ is also one of the few interbank networks that does not charge its customers for transactions via another member bank's ATM, having removed all interbank transaction charges on April 4, 2006.

While Citibank has many ATMs, only a percentage of them are part of the atm⁵ group. Hence, banks usually recommend customers to make sure that the atm⁵ logo is present on the members' ATM before they carry out their transaction(s).

[[Image:Prześcieradło.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A blue bed sheet]]
{{Wiktionary}}
A '''sheet''' is a rectangular piece of [[cloth]] used as [[bedding]], being placed immediately below or above [[bed]] occupants. Bed sheets can generally be divided into two categories: "top" and "bottom" sheets. 

A bottom sheet is laid above the [[mattress]] and bed occupants lie on it. It may be either a flat sheet (extra fabric is usually tucked under the mattress), or a fitted sheet, which is sewn in a pocket-like shape to go down over the corners of the mattress, and has an elastic band around the edges of the sheet to prevent the sheet from slipping. However, this can make it more difficult to fold when not in use. 

Bottom sheets are standard in developed countries. They are more easily washable than a mattress, and when used properly can protect the longevity of the mattress and provide better sanitation for bed occupants. The biggest problem with bed sheets is that they are often not effective. Take this common example, for example. When a person lays a bed sheet down on their bed, the surrounding environment will either cool down or heat up the single bed sheet. To combat this, a bed sheet patron must apply an additional bed sheet to the bed before use.

A top sheet is a flat sheet which bed occupants lie underneath. [[Blanket]]s, quilts, duvets/[[comforter]]s and other bed covers are laid over the top sheet, but because of the top sheet they do not directly touch the bed occupant.

Top sheets are standard in the U.S., but much of Europe prefers to use duvet covers. A duvet cover consists of two rectangles sewn together on all but one side to create a sleeve for the duvet, which can be taken off and washed. When no other blankets are lain atop the covered duvet, it can provide several advantages over a top sheet. First, respecting sanitation, with a top sheet the bed occupant could accidentally in the night remove the barrier between themself and the duvet (which is less washable); with a duvet cover this is impossible. Second, for households with children, a bed with a covered duvet is easier to make: the child need only tug the corners of the duvet back towards the corners of the bed. Tucking in a top sheet before arranging the duvet is an extra step. Third, switching a duvet cover is a cheaper way to change color schemes than buying a new comforter.

However, a top sheet has its own advantages. First, a tucked-in top sheet can provide a comfortable feeling of snugness that duvets cannot, as duvets are not usually large enough to tuck under the mattress. Second, top sheets allow a wider range of blanket choices besides duvets, such as quilts. Top sheets are ultimately useless, as the bed sheet applicator will find no comfort of a single bed sheet unless they are in the bed, snuggling. Sheets are also much easier to replace after being washed, because duvets can be difficult to insert into a duvet cover. Using a duvet instead of a top sheet also prevents a bed user from removing blankets during the night without being completely without cover, whereas a top sheet provides basic coverage without insulating too much heat.

In some Asian countries, such as China, top sheets are not used. Flat sheets are often used in place of fitted sheets or together with them as bottom sheets.{{clarify|date=March 2016}} Most families prefer to use duvet covers to cover the quilts.

==History==
The term ''bed sheet'' was first used in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bed%20sheet|title=Bed sheet|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bed sheets were traditionally white and made of linen, cotton or silk, but now various colors and patterns are used.

==Styles==
[[File:Colorful Bed sheets.jpg|alt=|thumb|Assortment of different colored bed sheets]]
Bed sheets come in two main varieties: flat and fitted. A flat sheet is simply a rectangular sheet of cloth, while a [[wikt:fitted sheet|fitted sheet]] has its four corners, and sometimes two or four sides, fitted with [[Elastomer|elastic]], to be used only as a bottom sheet. The fitted sheet may also be secured using a drawstring instead of elastic. The purpose of a fitted bottom sheet is to keep it from slipping off the mattress while the bed is in use. A particular way of folding and tucking while making the bed, known as "hospital corners," is sometimes used when the bottom sheet is flat rather than fitted.

Usually a flat bed sheet is [[overlock]]ed around the edges to form four [[seam (sewing)|seams]]. One of the seams is wider than the other three and helps with orienting the sheet correctly on the [[mattress]]. The wider seam goes at the head end of the mattress. Sometimes the sides do not have seams, but are finished with the [[selvedge]] only. When placing a flat sheet on a bed, the manufacturer has designed the printed side to be softer, and thus it should be placed on the bed printed side "down". When folding back the covers, this also allows the printed side to show, for aesthetic purposes. When one [[Bed-making|makes a bed]], the patterned or [[monogram]]med side of the top sheet is placed facing down and then the top edge is folded towards the foot of the bed, exposing the design.

In the US and Canada, sheets are often sold in a four-piece set consisting of a fitted sheet, a flat sheet and two pillowcases. In China, a four-piece set consists of a duvet cover, two pillowcases and either a fitted or flat sheet. Fitted Sheets are gaining popularity due to ease of use. Use of good quality elastic make fitted sheets durable.

==Materials==

Cotton and cotton blends dominate the market. The most common blend being cotton and polyester. Cotton provides absorbency and a soft hand, while polyester adds durability and wrinkle resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/know-your-home-furnishings/oclc/53051985?referer=di&amp;ht=edition|title=Know Your Home Furnishings|last=Elsasser|first=Virginia Hencken|date=2004|publisher=Fairchild Publications|year=|isbn=1563672421|location=New York, NY|pages=|language=English|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common fibers used in the manufacturing of bed sheets include [[linen]], [[silk]], [[Modal (textile)|Modal]] and bamboo rayon, [[lyocell]], and [[polypropylene]]. Polypropylene (olefin) is a hypoallergenic spun-bound material produced at a low cost and typically used in emergency shelters or hospitals as disposable sheeting.

==Construction==
The quality of bed sheets is often conveyed by the [[thread count]]—the number of threads per square inch of material. In general, the higher the thread count, the softer the sheet, but the weave and type of thread may affect the "hand" of the material so that a sheet with a lower thread count may actually be softer than one with a higher count. Yarn quality also plays a part in the look and feel of sheets, as finer yarns tend to create a finer sheet fabric. The ply also plays a role in how heavy the sheet feels. Ply represents how many fibers are twisted together as the sheet is being created. A 2 ply 300 thread count sheet will feel heavier than a single ply 600 thread count sheet. 
 
The most common constructions are muslin, [[percale]], sateen, flannel, and knitted jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/textiles-for-residential-and-commercial-interiors/oclc/953427784&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Textiles for Residential and Commercial Interiors|last=Willbanks|first=Amy|date=2014|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781609019372|location=|pages=|language=English|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[plain weave]] the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[weft]] cross each other one at a time, and [[sateen]], has multiple threads (usually three or four) over, and one under.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=  |title=The Difference Between Percale &amp; Sateen |first=George |last=Boykin |work=[[eHow]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite 4''' ('''CBERS-4'''), also known as '''Ziyuan I-04''' or '''Ziyuan 1E''', is a [[remote sensing]] satellite intended for operation as part of the [[China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program]]me between the [[China]] [[China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application|Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application]] and [[Brazil]]'s [[National Institute for Space Research]].&lt;ref name="gsp"/&gt; The fifth CBERS satellite to fly, it was successfully launched on 7 December 2014. It replaces [[CBERS-3]] which was lost in a launch failure in December 2013.

==Spacecraft==
CBERS-4 is a {{convert|1980|kg|lb|adj=on}} spacecraft based on the [[Phoenix-Eye 1]] [[satellite bus]].&lt;ref name="gsp"/&gt; It was developed by the [[China Academy of Space Technology]], in partnership with Brazil, at a cost of US$125 million for each party. The spacecraft have a single solar array which provides power to its systems, generating 2,300&amp;nbsp;watts of electrical power, and have a design life of three years.&lt;ref name="EOP"/&gt;

The CBERS-4 spacecraft carries four instruments: MUXCam, a multispectral camera; PanMUX, a [[panchromatic]] imager; the Infrared Medium Resolution Scanner, or IRSCAM, and WFICAM, a wide-field imaging camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbers.inpe.br/ingles/satellites/description_cbers3_4.php|title=CBERS - Satélite Sino-Brasileiro de Recursos Terrestres|publisher=INPE|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cameras will be used to observe a swath of {{convert|120|km}} of landmass at a time, enabling the satellite to scan the entire surface of the planet every 26 days, with a spatial resolution of up to {{convert|20|m}}.&lt;ref name="GdP"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/vidaecidadania/conteudo.phtml?tl=1&amp;id=1429846&amp;tit=Brasil-vai-ao-espaco-via-China|title=Brasil vai ao espaço via China|trans-title=Brazil goes to space through China|work=Gazeta do Povo|accessdate=2014-12-07|date=2013-12-02|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBERS-4 was initially scheduled to be launched in 2015, however after the loss of [[CBERS-3]] at launch in December 2013, China and Brazil agreed to accelerate the production of CBERS-4 by 1 year.&lt;ref name="falha"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbers.inpe.br/noticia.php?Cod_Noticia=3471|title=Lançamento do CBERS-3|publisher=INPE|date=December 9, 2013|accessdate=December 7, 2014|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite will restore the Brazilian government's ability to observe its own territory following a 4.5-year gap caused by the failure of [[CBERS-2B]] and [[CBERS-3]].

==Launch==
A [[Long March 4B|Chang Zheng 4B]] carrier rocket was used to launch CBERS-4. The launch took place at 03:26 UTC on 7 December 2014, using [[Taiyuan Launch Complex 9|Launch Complex 9]] at the [[Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center|Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre]]. The satellite was successfully placed into a [[sun-synchronous orbit]].

A '''cash sorter machine''' is a [[machine]] used for sorting [[banknotes]]. Cash Sorters can file through a number of banknotes, and sort it into [[Denomination (currency)|denominations.]] Many Cash Sorters also function as a [[banknote counter]], and can count money as well as splitting them into groups. Some cash sorters can also detect [[counterfeit money]] using security features of the banknote. Primary users are [[bank]]s, [[financial institution]]s, [[casino]]s, and large [[theme park]]s, as they all come across large amounts of [[cash]].

'''Celluloids''' are a class of  [[Chemical compound|compounds]] created from [[nitrocellulose]] and [[camphor]], with added dyes and other agents.  Generally considered the first [[thermoplastic]], it was first created as '''Parkesine''' in 1856&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Fenichell, Plastic: The Making of a Synthetic Century, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and as '''Xylonite''' in 1869, before being registered as  ''Celluloid'' in 1870. Celluloid is easily [[Molding (process)|molded]] and shaped, and it was first widely used as an [[ivory]] replacement.

The main use was in movie and photography film industries, which used only celluloid film stock prior to the adoption of [[Cellulose acetate|acetate]] safety film in the 1950s. Celluloid is highly flammable, difficult and expensive to produce and no longer widely used; its most common uses today are in [[table tennis|table tennis balls]], musical instruments, and [[guitar pick]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dandreapicks.com/about.htm Andrea Picks: The Saga of Cellulose] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124231926/http://www.dandreapicks.com/about.htm |date=January 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Nitrocellulose===
Nitrocellulose-based plastics slightly predate celluloid. [[Collodion]], invented in 1848 and used as a wound dressing and an emulsion for photographic plates, is dried to a celluloid-like film.

===Alexander Parkes===
[[File:Old celluloid film rolls (5201105455).jpg|alt=|thumb|old '''Celluloid films'''

]]
The first celluloid as a bulk material for forming objects was made in 1855 in [[Birmingham]], England, by [[Alexander Parkes]], who was never able to see his invention reach full fruition, after his firm went bankrupt due to scale-up costs.&lt;ref name="Painter &amp; Coleman" /&gt; Parkes patented his discovery as Parkesine in 1862 after realising a solid residue remained after evaporation of the solvent from photographic collodion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=UK Patent office|title=Patents for inventions|year=1857|publisher=UK Patent office|pages=255|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nCoU-2tAx8C&amp;pg=PA255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parkes patented it as a clothing waterproofer for woven fabrics in the same year. Later Parkes showcased Parkesine at the 1862 International Exhibition in London, where he was awarded a bronze medal for his efforts. The introduction of Parkesine is generally regarded as the birth of the plastics industry.&lt;ref name="Painter &amp; Coleman"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Paul C. |last1=Painter  |first2=Michael M. |last2=Coleman  |url= https://books.google.com/?id=CL7O_hH0aw4C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=PARKESINE+alexander+parkes#v=onepage&amp;q=PARKESINE%20alexander%20parkes&amp;f=false |title=Essentials of Polymer Science and Engineering |chapter=The Early History of Polymers |year=2008 |pages=7–9 |publisher=DEStech&gt;|isbn=9781932078756 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parkesine was made from [[cellulose]] treated with [[nitric acid]] and a [[solvent]]. It is often called synthetic ivory. The Parkesine company ceased trading in 1868. Pictures of Parkesine are held by the [[Plastics Historical Society]] of London. There is a plaque on the wall of the site of the Parkesine Works in [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ep-first-plastic-in-the-world.htm |title=Hackney Council - First Plastic in the World |first= |last= |work=hackney.gov.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Wesley Hyatt===
In the 1860s, an American, [[John Wesley Hyatt]], acquired Parkes's patent and began experimenting with cellulose nitrate with the intention of manufacturing [[billiard ball]]s, which until that time were made from [[ivory]]. He used [[cloth]], ivory dust, and [[shellac]], and on April 6, 1869, patented a method of covering billiard balls with the addition of collodion. With assistance from Peter Kinnear and other investors,&lt;ref name="NYSPL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc22082.htm |title=Albany Billiard Ball Company Records, 1894-1944; Bulk 1915-1944 |year=2009 |first=Fred (ed.) |last=Bassett |work=NYSL.NYSED.gov |at="Manuscripts and Special Collections" section |publisher=New York State Library, NYS Education Dept |location=Albany, NY, US |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105050050/http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc22082.htm |archivedate=January 5, 2013 |accessdate=January 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyatt formed the [[Albany Billiard Ball Company]] (1868–1986) in [[Albany, New York]], to manufacture the product. In 1870, John and his brother Isaiah patented a process of making a "horn-like material" with the inclusion of cellulose nitrate and camphor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=AbVXAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=105,338 |title=US patent #105,338 issued July 12, 1870 |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander Parkes and Daniel Spill ''(see below)'' listed camphor during their earlier experiments, calling the resultant mix "xylonite", but it was the Hyatt brothers who recognized the value of camphor and its use as a plasticizer for cellulose nitrate. Isaiah Hyatt dubbed his material "celluloid" in 1872.

===Daniel Spill and legal disputes===
[[File:US-NJ(1891) p568 NEWARK, THE CELLULOID COMPANY.jpg|thumbnail|Newark, New Jersey, industrial production complex of the Celluloid Company (c. 1890)]]
English inventor [[Daniel Spill]] had worked with Parkes and formed the Xylonite Co. to take over Parkes' patents, describing the new plastic products as ''Xylonite''. He took exception to the Hyatts' claims and pursued the brothers in a number of court cases between 1877 and 1884. Initially the judge found in Spill's favour, but ultimately it was judged that neither party held an exclusive claim and the true inventor of celluloid/xylonite was Alexander Parkes, due to his mention of camphor in his earlier experiments and patents.&lt;ref name=THG&gt;Daniel Spill, Celluloid Manufacturing Company, United States. Circuit Court (New York : Southern District) ''Spill vs. Celluloid Manufacturing Company litigation documents''&lt;/ref&gt; The judge ruled all manufacturing of celluloid could continue both in Spill's British Xylonite Company and Hyatts' Celluloid Manufacturing Company.

[[File:Arco pen.jpg|thumb|upright|Celluloid and [[sterling silver]] pen.]]
The name ''Celluloid'' actually began as a [[trademark]] of the Celluloid Manufacturing Company, first of Albany, NY, and later of [[Newark, New Jersey]], which manufactured the celluloids patented by John Wesley Hyatt. Hyatt used heat and pressure to simplify the manufacture of these compounds. Over the years, celluloid became the common use term used for this type of plastic. In 1878 Hyatt was able to patent a process for injection moulding thermoplastics, although it took another fifty years before it could be realised commercially, and in later years celluloid was used as the base for [[photographic film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plastiquarian.com/index.php?id=13&amp;subid=135&amp;osCsid=fc41f33a8e541b152ad79a59d00b3d19 |title=Plastics Historical Society |publisher=Plastiquarian.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English photographer [[John Carbutt]] founded the Keystone Dry Plate Works in 1879 with the intention of producing gelatin dry plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historiccamera.com/cgi-bin/librarium2/pm.cgi?action=app_display&amp;app=datasheet&amp;app_id=1782&amp;|title=John Carbutt at Historic Camera - History Librarium|work=historiccamera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Celluloid Manufacturing Company was contracted for this work, which was done by thinly slicing layers out of celluloid blocks and then removing the slice marks with heated pressure plates. After this, the celluloid strips were coated with a photosensitive gelatin emulsion. It is not certain exactly how long it took for Carbutt to standardize his process, but it occurred no later than 1888. A {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} sheet of Carbutt's film was used by [[William Dickson (film pioneer)|William Dickson]] for the early [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] [[motion picture]] experiments on a cylinder drum Kinetograph. However, the celluloid [[film base]] produced by this means was still considered too stiff for the needs of motion-picture photography.

By 1889, more flexible celluloids for [[photographic film]] were developed, and both [[Hannibal Goodwin]] and the [[Kodak|Eastman Kodak Company]] obtained patents for a film product. ([[Ansco]], which purchased Goodwin's patent after he died, was eventually successful in a patent-infringement suit against Kodak). This ability to produce photographic images on a [[Nitrate film|flexible material]] (as opposed to a glass or metal plate) was a crucial step toward making possible the advent of motion pictures.

Most movie and photography films prior to the widespread move to [[Cellulose acetate film|acetate films]] in the 1950s were made of celluloid. Its high flammability was legendary since it self-explodes when exposed to temperatures over 150°&amp;nbsp;C in front of a hot movie-projector beam. While celluloid film was standard for 35mm theatrical productions until around 1950, motion-picture film for amateur use, such as 16mm and 8mm film, were on acetate "safety base", at least in the US.

Celluloid was useful for creating cheaper jewellery, jewellery boxes, hair accessories and many items that would earlier have been manufactured from ivory, horn or other expensive animal products.  It was often referred to as "Ivorine" or "French Ivory". For this use, a form of celluloid was developed in France that had lines in it to make it resemble  [[Ivory|ivory]].&lt;ref name=Grasso16&gt;{{cite book |last=Grasso |first=Tony |date=1996 |title= Bakelite Jewellery A Collector's guide|publisher=The Apple Press |page=16 |isbn=1850766134 }} &lt;/ref&gt;  It was also used for dressing table sets, dolls, picture frames, charms, hat pins, buttons, buckles, stringed instrument parts, [[accordions]], fountain pens, cutlery handles and kitchen items.  The main disadvantage the material had was that it was flammable.  Items made in celluloid are collectible today and increasingly rare in good condition.  It was soon overtaken by [[Bakelite]] and [[Catalin]]. Table tennis [[Table tennis#Ball|balls]] are still made from celluloid. "Parker Brothers...made some versions {{bracket|of [[diabolo]]s}} out of hollow Celluloid--which, because of its '[[friction]]less' properties, spun even faster than steel."&lt;ref&gt;Orbanes, Philip (2004). ''The Game Makers: The Story of Parker Brothers from Tiddledy Winks to Trivial Pursuit'', p.48. Harvard Business. {{ISBN|9781591392699}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelf clocks and other furniture items were often covered with celluloid in a manner similar to [[wood veneer|veneer]].  This celluloid was printed to look like expensive woods, or materials like marble or granite.  The [[Seth Thomas (clockmaker)|Seth Thomas]] clock company called its celluloid clock material "adamantine".  Celluloid enabled clockmakers to make the typical late Victorian style of black [[mantel clock]] in such a way that the wooden case appeared to be black marble, and the various pillars and other decorative elements of the case looked like semi-precious stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Seth Thomas Clocks &amp; Movements | publisher=U. S. Books | author=Ly, Tran Duy | year=1996 | isbn=0-9647406-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Handharmonika.jpg|thumb|Flaming celluloid pattern on an accordion.]]

Celluloid was also a popular material in the construction of [[slide rules]]. It was primarily used to coat wooden slide rule faces, such as in early [[Faber-Castell|A.W. Faber]] rules, as well as cursor end pieces, such as in [[Keuffel and Esser]] rules.

Celluloid remains in use for musical instruments, especially accordions and guitars. Celluloid is very robust and easy to mold in difficult forms, and has great acoustic performance as cover for wooden frames since it does not block wood's natural pores. Instruments covered with celluloid can easily be recognized by the material's typical [[nacre]]-like flaming pattern. Thick celluloid panels are cooked in a [[bain-marie]] which turns them into a leather-like substance. Panels are then turned on a mold and allowed to harden for as long as three months.

==Formulation==
A typical formulation of celluloid might contain 70 to 80 parts [[nitrocellulose]], nitrated to 11% [[nitrogen]], 30 parts [[camphor]], 0 to 14 parts [[dye]], 1 to 5 parts [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]], plus stabilizers and other agents to increase stability and reduce flammability.

==Production==

Celluloid is made from a mixture of chemicals such as nitrocellulose, camphor, alcohol, as well as colorants and fillers depending on the desired product. The first step is transforming raw cellulose into nitrocellulose by conducting a [[nitration]] reaction. This is achieved by exposing the cellulose fibers to an aqueous solution of nitric acid; the hydroxyl groups (-OH) will then be replaced with nitrate groups (-NO3) on the cellulose chain. The reaction can produce mixed products, depending on the degree of substitution of nitrogen, or the percent nitrogen content on each cellulose molecule; cellulose nitrate has 2.8 molecule of nitrogen per molecule of cellulose. It was determined that sulfuric acid was to be used as well in the reaction in order to first, catalyze the nitric acid groups so it can allow for the substitution onto the cellulose, and second, allow for the groups to easily and uniformly attach to the fibers, creating a better quality nitrocellulose. The product then must be rinsed to wash away any free acids that did not react with the fibers, dried, and kneaded. During this time, a solution of 50% camphor in alcohol is added, which then changes the macromolecule structure of nitrocellulose into a homogeneous gel of nitrocellulose and camphor. The chemical structure is not well understood, but it is determined that it is one molecule of camphor for each unit of glucose. After the mixing, the mass is pressed into blocks at a high pressure and then is fabricated for its specific use.&lt;ref name="cool.conservation-us.org"&gt;"JAIC 1991, Volume 30, Number 2, Article 3 (pp. 145 to 162)." JAIC 1991, Volume 30, Number 2, Article 3 (pp. 145 to 162). Web. 18 Nov. 2014. &lt;http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic30-02-003_3.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitrating cellulose is an extremely flammable process in which even factory explosions are not uncommon. Many western celluloid factories closed after hazardous explosions, and only two factories in China remain in business.

==Environmental hazards==

===Deterioration===
[[File:A Fungi damaged photographic slide.tif|thumb|A fungus-damaged photographic slide]]
Many sources of deterioration in celluloid exist, such as thermal, chemical, photochemical, and physical.  The most inherent flaw is as celluloid ages, the camphor molecules are ‘squeezed’ out of the mass due to the unsustainable pressure used in the production. That pressure causes the nitrocellulose molecules to bind back to each other or crystallize, and this results in the camphor molecules being shoved out of the material. Once exposed to the environment, camphor can undergo [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] at room temperature, leaving the plastic as brittle nitrocellulose. Also, with exposure to excess heat, the nitrate groups can break off and expose nitrogen gases, such as [[nitrous oxide]] and [[nitric oxide]],&lt;ref&gt;Springate, Megan E. (1997) "Cellulose Nitrate Plastic (Celluloid) in Archaeological Assemblages: Identification and Care,"Northeast Historical Archaeology: Vol. 26 26: Iss. 1, Article 5.
&lt;/ref&gt; to the air.

Another factor that can cause this is excess moisture, which can accelerate deterioration of nitrocellulose with the presence of nitrate groups, either newly fragmented from heat or still trapped as a free acid from production. Both of these sources allow the accumulation of nitric acid. Another form of deterioration, photochemical deterioration, is severe in celluloid because it absorbs [[ultraviolet]] light well. The absorbed light leads to chain-breakage and stiffening.&lt;ref name="cool.conservation-us.org"/&gt;

[[Accordion]]s even over 100 years old covered with thick celluloid might be in pristine condition, while on the other hand thin celluloid film stocks are often melted in an unrecognisable solid block after decades in storage.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

'''Coffee cup sleeves''', also known as '''coffee sleeves''', '''coffee clutches''', '''coffee cozies''', '''hot cup jackets''', '''paper [[zarf]]s''', '''coffee collars''', '''coffee sleeve''',  and '''cup holders''', are roughly cylindrical sleeves that fit tightly over handle-less paper [[coffee]] cups to insulate the drinker's hands from hot coffee. Coffee sleeves are typically made of textured [[paperboard]], but can be found made of other materials. Coffee sleeves allow [[coffee house]]s, [[fast food restaurant]]s, and other vendors to avoid double-cupping, the practice of using two (or more) nested [[paper cup]]s for a single hot beverage. Some paper cup holders carry [[advertisements]].

The coffee sleeve was invented in 1991 by [[Jay Sorensen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/how-the-coffee-cup-sleeve-was-invented-119479/?no-ist|title=How the Coffee Cup Sleeve Was Invented|website=Smithsonian|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[patent]]ed in 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sorensen|first=Jay|title=United States Patent: 5425497 - Cup holder|date=June 20, 1995|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%252Fnetahtml%252FPTO%252Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=5425497.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5425497&amp;RS=PN/5425497|accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (under the [[trademark]]ed name '''Java Jacket'''), and are now commonly utilized by coffee houses and other vendors that sell hot beverages dispensed in [[disposable]] paper cups. There are a number of patents that cover various coffee sleeves and their aspects. Other people have claimed to invent the coffee sleeve. 

There are a number of companies that manufacture coffee sleeves; the top five companies by volume of coffee sleeves sold in the U.S. are, in no particular order, [[International Paper]], [[LBP Manufacturing]], Java Jacket and [[Labansat &amp; Schulz Manufacturing]].{{CN|date=August 2018}}

The sleeve was invented while Sorensen was driving his daughter Ryeder to school and spilt a cup of coffee in his lap.  The java jacket first appeared at the Seattle Coffeefest in 1995 and Sorensen and his wife Colleen were overwhelmed with requests and orders to fill.

Coffee cup sleeves can be customized by having [[logo]]s or brands printed directly on the sleeves. Many coffee shops have custom printed coffee sleeves. 

Coffee sleeves should not be confused with fixed [[cup holders]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11883">'''Commuter Challenge''' is a national, week long event in Canada and is held annually during the [[Environment Canada#Environment Week Act, Canadian|Canadian Environment Week]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ec.gc.ca/sce-cew/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=56886AF1-1 Environment Canada: Canadian Environment Week]&lt;/ref&gt; Formatted as a friendly competition between workplaces and Canadian municipalities, the national and host city coordinators announce winners based on the highest percent participation.  The event has a strong workplace focus where employers promote the event in-house to support their employees in leaving their cars at home in favour of more sustainable commuter modes including walking, jogging, cycling, in-line skating, public transit, [[carpooling]] and [[teleworking]].

The first Commuter Challenge was hosted in 1991 and the Canadian Commuter Challenge tracking tool was launched in 1999 and is currently coordinated nationally by the [[Calgary]]-based environmental group, the Sustainable Alberta Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://calgarycommute.ca/ Sustainable Alberta Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Participants record their commutes and are ranked via Sustainable Alberta Association's web-based tracking tools. In 2014, Commuter Challenge drew participation from over 26,675 individuals and 1,803 workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commuterchallenge.ca Commuter Challenge blog: Results]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Small sustainable transportation events started emerging in Canada in the early 1990s in different cities across the country; all under different names and in different formats.

In 1991 in Calgary, Andrea Main, then curator of the ERCB's Energeum (Energy Resources Conservation Board, now [[Alberta Energy Utilities Board]]), organized an interdepartmental competition to promote alternative transportation options for that year's National Environment Week. In 1992, the ERCB challenged three other energy companies in Calgary to a friendly competition to see which workplace had the highest percent of sustainable commuters. By 1995, the Calgary Challenge had mushroomed to include 25 workplaces, primarily oil and gas companies.&lt;sup&gt;[[Commuter Challenge#cite note-4|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Andrea Main drafted the original proposal for the challenge and coined the name "Commuter Challenge".  In its inaugural year, the ERCB's Gas Department won the competition—the prize for which was the adoption of one acre of rainforest.  Individual distance winners won T-shirts donated by [[Mountain Equipment Co-op|Mountain Equipment Coop]].

At the same time in 1991, cyclists from [[Ottawa]] and [[Hull, Quebec]], organized the first commuter challenge in the National Capital Region. The annual event was founded by Mike Buckthought, a programmer-analyst and avid cyclist.&lt;ref&gt;Tong, Tracey (June&amp;nbsp;3, 2008). "Turns out commute is a challenge," ''Metro News''.&lt;/ref&gt; During National Environment Week, participants from [[Environment Canada]] and Forestry Canada reduced emissions by an estimated 1&amp;nbsp;tonne of carbon dioxide. Reductions in emissions were estimated using Environment Canada's Mobile 4C model. In 1992, the challenge expanded to include four organizations in Ottawa-Hull (Environment Canada, Forestry Canada, [[Bell Canada]], and [[Bell-Northern Research]]). Participants reduced greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 8&amp;nbsp;tonnes of carbon dioxide.

In 1995, the event expanded to include the first inter-city challenge, with Ottawa-Hull competing against [[London, Ontario]]. That year, the event included participants from Ottawa-Hull and London, as well as other cities in [[Ontario]], [[British Columbia]], Alberta and the United States. Reductions in emissions were estimated using Environment Canada's Mobile 5C model. On May 18, 1995, participants reduced emissions by an estimated 5&amp;nbsp;tonnes of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;Buckthought, Mike (July–August 1995). "Cycling Challenge '95," ''Peace and Environment News'' (Ottawa).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Calgary challenged Vancouver, Ottawa and London to an informal intercity challenge which attracted the attention of the Canadian Broadcasting Association (CBC) demonstrated the need for a national challenge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toolsofchange.com/English/CaseStudies/default.asp?ID=113 Tools of Change: Commuter Challenge, Environment Canada's Participation]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, over 14,500 people in Ottawa-Hull, London, Calgary, Vancouver and [[Victoria, BC|Victoria]] used environment-friendly transportation to get to work during Environment Week.&lt;ref&gt;Buckthought, Mike (July–August 1998). "Car-less Commuters Challenge Pollution," ''Peace and Environment News'' (Ottawa).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Sustainable Alberta Association received Federal Government support through the Climate Change Action Fund to launch a national event and website over three years.  The project, led by Kathryn Winkler, made it possible for regions, workplaces and individuals anywhere in Canada to participate and see the impact that they have as a result of their commuter choices. The impacts that are available by region, by workplace/team and for individuals include GHG reductions, calories burned, liters of fuel saved as well as regional and workplace participation levels.

By 2000, twenty Canadian cities had signed up for the event with host organizations ranging from not-for-profit environmental groups, municipal offices and health authoriteis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toolsofchange.com/en/case-studies/detail/155/ Tools of Change: Calgary Commuter Challenge].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 the national program coordination was handed off to an Ottawa-based non-governmental organization, Auto Free Ottawa.

In 2002 it was passed on to Go for Green, another Ottawa-based non-governmental organization. Go for Green coordinated the Commuter Challenge from 2002 to 2008.

In 2003, a total of 48,764 people joined the Commuter Challenge. The event was launched by Environment Minister David Anderson on May&amp;nbsp;30, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Environment Canada (May&amp;nbsp;28, 2003). "Environment Minister Launches Canadian Environment Week."&lt;/ref&gt; The Commuter Challenge was now a national event, with participation from all provinces and territories. A number of cities showed strong support for green transportation, with high numbers of participants: Ottawa-Gatineau (10,807), Winnipeg (10,058), Vancouver (9,219), Central Okanagan, BC (6,560), Waterloo Region (4,146), and Calgary (1,659).

In 2006 Justin Trudeau was the National Spokes person for the event &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2hdQhILBRk Justin Trudeau PSA for the 2006 Commuter Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt; and endorse the program.

In 2009 Sustainable Alberta Association took on the national coordination once again. Today the Commuter Challenge is delivered by a small team of dedicated volunteers and occasional contract help out of the SAA office in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The program is primarily funded by fees paid by corporate participants in Calgary and corporate sponsorships. Other financial support includes contributions from regional coordinators, the City of Calgary, foundations and local funding sources.

== Partner organizations ==

Commuter Challenge has had many partners over the years. Significant long-term partners include: Better Environmentally Sound Transportation (BEST),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commuterchallengebc.ca/ 2012 BEST Commuter Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit organization that coordinates the Commuter Challenge in [[British Columbia]]; the [[Green Action Centre]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenactioncentre.ca/program/commuterchallenge/ Green Action Centre: 2013 Commuter Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt; an organization that coordinates the event in [[Manitoba]]; and Clean Nova Scotia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://clean.ns.ca/programs/transportation/commuter-challenge/ Clean Nova Scotia:Commuter Challenge 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211104504/http://clean.ns.ca/programs/transportation/commuter-challenge/ |date=2013-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a foundation based in Nova Scotia.

Government partners have included the Province of Manitoba, the Province of British Columbia, the City of [[Winnipeg]], the City of [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] and the [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo|Region of Waterloo]]. Major support is received annually though collaboration with the City of Calgary, notably its transportation department.

Sustainable Alberta Association and the Calgary Commuter Challenge received funding from the Climate Change Action Fund (CCAF). The funding supported development of an online data collection system.

In 2011 Sustainable Alberta Association participated in the [[Shell Canada|Shell]] "Fuelling Change" grant and won $100,000 to help facilitate the development of the new commuter tracking software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fuellingchange.com Fuelling Change: Canadian Commuter Challenge - Give Your Car a Day Off program]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Commuter Challenge partnered with Climate Change Central (C-3), another Alberta-based environmental advocacy group, to give away [[air miles]] to randomly chosen participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatechangecentral.com/node/690 Climate Change Central: C3 and Commuter Challenge Campaign Details] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608065651/http://climatechangecentral.com/node/690 |date=2012-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ConocoPhillips has been the longest standing private sector supporter of the Calgary Commuter Challenge (since 2007) that contributes directly to the national program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conocophillips.ca/EN/sd/investment/volunteer/Pages/index.aspx ConocoPhillips]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1831">A '''delay-line oscillator''' is a form of [[electronic oscillator]] that uses a [[Analog delay line|delay line]] as its principal timing element.

The circuit is set to oscillate by [[Inverter (logic gate)|inverting]] the output of the delay line and feeding that signal back to the input of the delay line with appropriate amplification. The simplest style of delay-line oscillator, when properly designed, will oscillate with period exactly two times the delay period of the delay line. Additional outputs that are correlated in frequency with the main output but vary in phase can be derived by using additional taps from within the delay line.

The delay line may be realized with a physical delay line (such as an [[LC circuit|LC network]] or a [[transmission line]]). In contrast to a [[Phase-shift oscillator]] in which LC components are lumped, the capacitances and inductances are distributed through the length of the delay line. A [[ring oscillator]] uses a delay line formed from the [[gate delay]] of a cascade of [[logic gate]]s. The timing of a circuit using a physical delay line is usually much more accurate. It is also easier to get such a circuit to oscillate in the desired [[Overtone|mode]].

The delay-line oscillator may be allowed to ''free run'' or it may be gated for use in [[Asynchronous circuit|asynchronous logic]].

Since the optical cavity is a delay line, a [[laser]] can be regarded as a special case of the delay-line oscillator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31428">'''Digital history''' is the use of [[digital media]] to further [[historical]] analysis, presentation, and research.  It is a branch of the [[Digital humanities]] and an extension of [[quantitative history]], [[cliometrics]], and computing.  Digital history is commonly digital public history, concerned primarily with engaging online audiences with historical content, or, digital research methods, that further academic research. Digital history outputs include: digital archives, online presentations, data visualizations, interactive maps, time-lines, audio files, and virtual worlds to make history more accessible to the user. A researcher can interact with, explore and visualise, the output more easily than with conventional [[historiography|historiographical material]]. Recent digital history projects focus on creativity, collaboration, and technical innovation, [[text mining]], [[corpus linguistics]], [[Social network analysis|network analysis]], [[3D Modeling]], and [[big data]] analysis. Utilising these resources the user can rapidly develop new analyses that can link to, extend, and bring to life existing histories.

== History ==
Early digital history in the 1960s and 70s focused on quantitative analyses, primarily of demographic data - censuses, election returns, city directories, etc. These early computers could be programmed to conduct statistical analyses of these records, creating tallies, or seeking trends across records.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dollar and Richard Jensen, ''Historians Guide to Statistics'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;  This research into historical demography was rooted in the rise of [[social history]] as a field of historical interest. The historians involved in this work sought to quantify past societies, to come to new conclusions about communities and population. Computers proved capable tools for that type of work.  By the late 1970s younger historians turned to cultural studies, but the outpouring of quantitive studies by established scholars continued. Since then, [[Quantitative history]] and [[Cliometrics]] have been used primarily by historically-minded economists and political scientists.  In the late 1980s quantifiers founded [[Association for History and Computing|The Association for History and Computing]].  This movement provided some of the impetus for the rise of digital history in the 1990s.&lt;ref name ="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book| last =Thomas, III| first =William G.| chapter =Computing and the Historical Imagination| title =A Companion to Digital Humanities| editor =Susan Schreibman |editor2=Ray Siemens |editor3=John Unsworth| publisher =[[Blackwell Publishing|Blackwell]]| year =2004| location =Oxford| url =http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/| accessdate =2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent roots of digital history were in software rather than online networks.  In 1982, the [[Library of Congress]] embarked on its Optical Disk Pilot Project, which placed text and images from its collection on to laserdiscs and CD-ROMs. The library started offering online exhibits in 1992 when it launched Selected Civil War Photographs. In 1993, [[Roy Rosenzweig]], along with Steve Brier and [[Joshua Brown (historian)|Josh Brown]], produced their award-winning CD-ROM ''Who Built America? From the Centennial Exposition of 1876 to the Great War of 1914'', designed for [[Apple Inc.|Apple, Inc.]] that integrated images, text, film and sound clips, displayed in a visual interface that supported a text narrative.&lt;ref name="burton"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burton |first=Orville Vernon |title=American Digital History |journal=Social Science Computer Review |volume=23 |issue=2 |date=Summer 2005 |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/resources/essays/d/30 |pages=206–220 |accessdate=2008-03-31 |doi=10.1177/0894439304273317 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318045758/http://chnm.gmu.edu/resources/essays/d/30 |archivedate=2008-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest online digital history projects were The Heritage Project of the University of Kansas and [[medieval]] historian Dr. Lynn Nelson's World History Index and History Central Catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vlib.iue.it/history/index.html|title=WWW-VL History Central Catalogue Florence (IT)|first=Serge Noiret and Inaki Lopez|last=Martin|date=5 June 2004|website=vlib.iue.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was [[The Valley of the Shadow]], conceived in 1991 by current [[University of Richmond]] President [[Edward L. Ayers]], who was then at the [[University of Virginia]]. The [[Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities]] (IATH) at the University of Virginia adopted the Valley Project and partnered with [[IBM]] to collect and transcribe historical sources into digital files.  The project collected data related to Augusta County in [[Virginia]] and Franklin County in [[Pennsylvania]] during the [[American Civil War]].  In 1996, William G. Thomas III joined Ayers on the Valley Project.  Together, they produced an online article entitled "The Differences Slavery Made: A Close Analysis of Two American Communities," which also appeared in the ''American Historical Review'' in 2003 [http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/AHR/].  A CD-ROM also accompanied the Valley Project, published by [[W. W. Norton and Company]] in 2000.&lt;ref name ="ayers"&gt;{{cite book| last =Ayers| first =Edward L.| authorlink =Edward L. Ayers| title =What Caused the Civil War| publisher =[[W. W. Norton and Company]]| year =2005| location =New York| isbn = 0-393-05947-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenzweig, who died October 11, 2007,&lt;ref name="rozensweigobit"&gt;{{cite news| last=Bernstein| first=Adam| title=Digital Historian Roy A. Rosenzweig| publisher=Washington Post| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/12/AR2007101202489.html| accessdate =2008-04-02 | date=2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded the [[Center for History and New Media]] (CHNM) at [[George Mason University]] in 1994.  Today, CHNM boasts several digital tools available to historians, such as [[Zotero]], [[Omeka]] or [[Tropy]].  In 1997, Ayers and Thomas used the term "digital history" when they proposed and founded the Virginia Center for Digital History (VCDH) at the University of Virginia, the earliest center devoted exclusively to history.&lt;ref name="burton" /&gt;  Several other institutions promoting digital history include the Center for Humane Arts, Letters, and Social Sciences Online (MATRIX) at Michigan State University, Maryland's Institute for Technology in the Humanities, and the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska.  In 2004, Emory University launched Southern Spaces, a "peer-reviewed Internet journal and scholarly forum" examining the history of the South.

== Applications ==
There are many potential benefits to the use of digital history when combined with traditional historical methods. Some of these applications include:
* Combining traditional historical methods and new research methods in order to come to new conclusions.
* Using different tools to extract and analyse larger amounts of data that would not be manageable otherwise.
* Create models and maps of data extracted to create a visualisation of the data.
* Data extracted and analysed can be placed alongside existing historiography to increase combined historical knowledge.
By adding new research methods to existing historical method, historians can benefit greatly from the ability to work with larger amounts of data and develop new interpretations from this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beals|first1=M. H.|title=Stuck in the Middle: Developing Research Workflows for a Multi-scale Text Analysis|journal=Journal of Victorian Culture|date=21 March 2017|pages=1–8|doi=10.1080/13555502.2017.1301178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Navickas|first1=Katrina|last2=Crymble|first2=Adam|title=From Chartist Newspaper to Digital Map of Grass-roots Meetings, 1841–44: Documenting Workflows|journal=Journal of Victorian Culture|date=20 March 2017|pages=1–16|doi=10.1080/13555502.2017.1301179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable projects ==
[[File:Social Network Analysis Visualization.png|thumb|Example of historical research using digital means: network visualization of the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation|ICIC]] archives, showing thousands of documents exchanged between [[League of Nations]] experts during the [[interwar period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 10| issue = 3| last = Grandjean| first = Martin| title = La connaissance est un réseau| journal =Les Cahiers du Numérique| date = 2014| pages = 37–54| url = http://www.cairn.info/resume.php?ID_ARTICLE=LCN_103_0037| doi=10.3166/lcn.10.3.37-54}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]The collaborative nature of most digital history endeavors has meant that the discipline has developed primarily at institutions with the resources to sponsor content research and technical innovation. Two of the first centers, George Mason University's Center for History and New Media and the Virginia Center for Digital History at the University of Virginia  have been among the leaders in the development of digital history projects and the education of digital historians.

Some of the noteworthy projects emerging from these pioneering centers are The Geography of Slavery, [[Texas Slavery Project|The Texas Slavery Project]], and The Countryside Transformed at VCDH and Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution and The Lost Museum at the CHNM. In each of these projects, mediated archives holding multiple types of sources are combined with digital tools to analyze and illuminate an historical question to a varying degree; this integration of content and tools with analysis is one of the hallmarks of digital history – projects move beyond archives or collections and into scholarly analysis and the use of digital tools to develop that analysis. The differences between the ways projects incorporate these integrations are a measure of the development of the field and point to the ongoing debates over what digital history can and should be.

While many of the projects at VCDH, CHNM, and other university's centers have been geared towards academics and post-secondary education, the [[University of Victoria]] (British Columbia), in conjunction with the [[Université de Sherbrooke]] and the [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]] at the University of Toronto, has created as series of projects for all ages, "Great Unsolved Mysteries in Canadian History."  Laden with instructional aids, this site asks teachers to introduce students to historical research methods to help them develop analytical skills and a sense of the complexities of their national history. Issues of race, religion, and gender are addressed in carefully constructed modules that cover incidents in Canadian history from Viking exploration through the 1920s. One of the original co-creators of the project, John Lutz has also developed Victoria's Victoria [http://web.uvic.ca/vv/] with the University of Victoria and [[Malaspina University-College]].

In addition to Ayers, Thomas, Lutz, and Rosenzweig, numerous other individual scholars work with digital history techniques and have made and/or continue to make important contributions to the field. Robert Darnton's 2000 article, "An Early Information Society: News and the Media in Eighteenth-Century Paris" was supplemented with electronic resources and is an early model of the discussions around digital history and its future in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Darnton |first=Robert |title=An Early Information Society: News and the Media in Eighteenth-Century Paris |journal=American Historical Review |volume=5 |issue=1 |year=2000 |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/105.1/ah000001.html |accessdate=2008-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217185549/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/105.1/ah000001.html |archivedate=2007-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first major digital projects to be reviewed by the American Historical Review (AHR) was Philip Ethington's "Los Angeles and the Problem of Urban Historical Knowledge" [http://cwis.usc.edu/dept/LAS/history/historylab/LAPUHK/index.html]—a multimedia exploration of changes to Los Angeles' physical profile over the course of several decades.  Patrick Manning, Andrew W. Mellon Professor of World History at the University of Pittsburgh, developed the CD-ROM project "Migration in Modern World History, 1500-2000." In the "African Slave Demography Project," Manning created a demographic simulation of the slave trade to show precisely how declined in West and Central Africa between 1730 and 1850 as well as in East Africa between the years 1820 and 1890 due to slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Patrick. 2007. Digital World History: An Agenda. Digital History portal, Department of History, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, available at http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/essays/manningessay.php.&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Reiff, of UCLA, co-edited the print and online versions of the Encyclopedia of Chicago. Andrew J. Torget, founded the Texas Slavery Project while at VCDH and continues to develop the site as he completes his PhD—likely a model for new digital scholars who will incorporate digital components into larger research agendas.

Another notable project that makes use of digital tools for historical practice is The [[Quilt Index]].&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluh, Mark. 2008. From Digital Repositories to Information Habitats: H-Net, the Quilt Index, Cyber Infrastructure, and Digital Humanities. First Monday 13(8): available at http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/2230/2019&lt;/ref&gt;  As scholars became increasingly interested in women's history, quilts became valuable to study.  The Quilt Index is an online collaborative database where quilt owners can upload pictures and data about their quilts.  This project was created due to the difficulty of collecting quilts.  Firstly, they were in the possession of various institutions, archives, and even civilians.  And secondly, they can be too fragile or bulky for physical transport.

Also in the field of women's history is ''Click! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution''. which highlights the collective action and individual achievements of women from the 1940s to the present.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cliohistory.org/click/ ''Click! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution''].&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, a pilot project began in 2002 to create a digital library of British History.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/|title=British History Online {{!}} The core printed primary and secondary sources for the medieval and modern history of the British Isles|website=www.british-history.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has developed into an extensive collection of over 1,200 volumes, bringing together primary and secondary sources from libraries, archives, museums and academics. Another significant project is the Old Bailey Online,a digital collection of all proceedings between 1674 and 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/|title=Old Bailey Online - The Proceedings of the Old Bailey, 1674-1913 - Central Criminal Court|website=www.oldbaileyonline.org|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the digitized records, the Old Bailey Online website provides historical and legal background information, research guides,and  educational resources for students.

== Digital history classes ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
The Digital History classes at the [[University of Hertfordshire]] have learned skills in [[digital mapping]] and [[Python programming]], which makes it more accessible and easier to analyse large quantities of source data. One project that the class worked on included taking data on weather, crime and poverty and using digital history skills to analyse the trends and patterns between them. This then allowed them to use their traditional history skills to evaluate the significance of the trends. Another project was using digital mapping to compare the differences between various groups of students who studied at Oxford derived from [[British History Online]].

At [[Cal State East Bay]], 12-15 history majors meet in the science building's computer lab to go over new and old software that could be used for the creation or presentation of history. Professor Kaatz specializes in early Christianity and ancient Rome, and needs to be well informed in the area of digitization. The digital history program is fairly new, and larger universities like Harvard and Stanford also have digital programs that are branches of their history programs.

[[California State University San Marcos]] offers a history graduate studies program with an emphasis on digital history. The master's thesis requirement is strongly encouraged to be half digital and half written, but the requirement can still be fulfilled by a traditional fully written thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csusm.edu/history/masters/|title=Overview - CSUSM|website=www.csusm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

Digital technology tools arrange ideas and promote the unique analysis of data, with many tools previously unavailable to historians opening new avenues for collaboration, text mining, and [[big data]] analysis. In addition, digital history offers tools for the presentation and access to historical knowledge online.

Digital historians may use web development tools, such as [[WYSIWYG]] [[HTML]]-editor [[Adobe Dreamweaver]]. Other tools create more interactive digital history, such as Databases, which provide greater capacity for information storage and retrieval in a definable way.  Databases with features like [[Structured Query Language]] (SQL) and [[Extensible Markup Language]] (XML) arrange materials in a formal manner and allow precise searching for keywords, dates, and other data characteristics. The online article "The Differences Slavery Made: A Close Analysis of Two American Communities" used XML for presenting and connecting evidence with detailed historiographical discussions.  The ''Valley of the Shadow'' project also employed XML to convert all of the archive's letters, diaries, and newspapers for full text searching capabilities. Coding languages such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]] may be used in order to digitally sort and filter data, whilst [[Google Fusion Tables]] can be used for the geographical mapping of data.

Digital historians may use [[content management systems]] (CSM) to store their digital collection that includes audio, visual, images and text for an online web display. Examples of these systems include: [[Drupal]], [[WordPress]], and [[Omeka]].&lt;ref&gt;Dean Rehberger. "Getting Oral History Online: Collections Management Applications." Oral History Review 40, no. 1 (2013): 83-94. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed February 12, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Differences Slavery Made'' also used [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS) to analyze and understand the spatial arrangement of social structures.  For the article, Ayers and Thomas created many new maps through GIS technology to produce detailed images of Augusta and Franklin counties never before possible.   GIS and its many components remain helpful for studying history and visualizing change over time.

The Semantic Interoperability of Metadata and Information in unLike Environments ([[SIMILE]]) project at [[MIT]] develops robust, open source tools that enable access, management, and envisaging digital assets.   Among the many tools built by SIMILE, the Timeline tool, which employs a [[DHTML]]-based AJAXy widget, allows digital historians to create dynamic, customizable timelines for visualizing time-based events.  The Timeline page on the SIMILE website declares that their tool "is like [[Google Maps]] for time-based information."  Additionally, SIMILE's Exhibit tool boasts a customizable structure for sorting and presenting data [https://web.archive.org/web/20100605063616/http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/t-reviews/exhibitgant.html].   Exhibit, written in [[Javascript]], creates interactive, data-rich web pages without the need for any programming or database creation knowledge.

Textual analysis software allows  historians to make new use of old sources by finding  patterns in large collections of documents or even just analyzing a source for frequency of terms. Textual analysis software allows historians to "text mine", a term used to describe correlations and themes in the documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsl.richmond.edu/dispatch/pages/intro|title=Mining the Dispatch|website=dsl.richmond.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several textual-analysis programs available online, from sophisticated ones that allow the researcher to tailor the program to handle large amounts of data, like [http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/ MALLET], and straightforward programs like [http://tokenx.unl.edu/ TokenX], which generates word-frequency lists and word clouds to illustrate language usage and significance, to basic ones like [http://www.wordle.net/ wordle], which offers simple visualizations of word frequency and relationships.  Some websites provide textual analysis on their content automatically. Online bookmarking and research tool [[del.icio.us]] uses [[tag clouds]] to visually depict the frequency and importance of user-generated tags, and the recently instituted Google Ngram Viewer allows viewers to search the commonality of textual themes by year.

However, with the development of digital history and the technology used to produce it, there has been questions raised over the validity of it. One such issue, is that raised by Jean Francois Baudrillard. He says that 'Western Culture introduced significant modifications to the way it produced the real, by intensifying it and heightening it into a domain of reality in hyperspace: hyper-reality'.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Gane, Jean Baudrillard: In Radical Uncertainty,  (Pluto Press, 2000) P. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dry cask storage''' is a method of storing high-level [[radioactive waste]], such as [[spent nuclear fuel]] that has already been cooled in the [[spent fuel pool]] for at least one year and often as much as ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/waste/spent-fuel-storage/dry-cask-storage.html|publisher=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]|title=Dry Cask Storage|quote=Dry cask storage allows spent fuel that has already been cooled in the spent fuel pool for at least one year to be surrounded by inert gas inside a container called a cask,|accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NRC-Spent-Fuel-Storage-FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/waste/spent-fuel-storage/faqs.html|publisher=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]|title=Spent Fuel Storage in Pools and Dry Casks: Key Points and Questions &amp; Answers |quote=Fuel is typically cooled at least 5 years in the pool before transfer to cask. NRC has authorized transfer as early as 3 years; the industry norm is about 10 years.|accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cask]]s are typically [[steel]] cylinders that are either [[welding|welded]] or [[Bolted joint|bolt]]ed closed. The fuel rods inside are surrounded by [[inert gas]]. Ideally, the steel cylinder provides leak-tight containment of the spent fuel. Each cylinder is surrounded by additional steel, [[concrete]], or other material to provide radiation shielding to workers and members of the public.

There are various dry storage cask system designs. With some designs, the steel cylinders containing the fuel are placed vertically in a concrete vault; other designs orient the cylinders horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/fig43.gif] NRC; Dry Cask Storage Figure 43&lt;/ref&gt; The concrete vaults provide the radiation shielding. Other cask designs orient the steel cylinder vertically on a concrete pad at a dry cask storage site and use both metal and concrete outer cylinders for radiation shielding. Currently there is no long term permanent storage facility; dry cask storage is designed as an interim safer solution than spent fuel pool storage.

Some of the cask designs can be used for both storage and transportation. Three companies – [[Holtec International]], NAC International and Areva-Transnuclear NUHOMS – are marketing Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSI's) based upon an unshielded multi-purpose canister which is transported and stored in on-site vertical or horizontal shielded storage modules constructed of steel and concrete.

==Usage==
During the 2000s, dry cask storage was used in the United States, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Japan, Armenia, Argentina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, South Korea, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine and Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infcis.iaea.org/NFCIS/Facilities|title=Nuclear Fuel Cycle Facilities (NFCIS)|first=IAEA - Int. Atomic Energy|last=Agency|date=|website=infcis.iaea.org|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agency2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=OECD Nuclear Energy Agency|title=Management of recyclable fissile and fertile materials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E1UuVHi7CDAC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=22 March 2011|date=May 2007|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-03255-2|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lt/&gt;

A similar system is also being implemented in Russia. However, it is based on 'storage compartments' in a single structure, rather than individual casks.

In 2017 France's [[Areva]] launched the NUHOMS Matrix advanced used nuclear fuel storage overpack, a high-density system for storing multiple spent fuel rods in canisters.&lt;ref name=wnn-20170929&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/WR-Arevas-space-saving-solution-for-used-fuel-storage-2909175.html |title=Areva's space-saving solution for used fuel storage |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=29 September 2017 |accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the need for alternative storage in the United States began to grow when pools at many nuclear reactors began to fill up with stored spent fuel. As there was not a national nuclear storage facility in operation at the time, utilities began looking at options for storing spent fuel. Dry cask storage was determined to be a practical option for storage of spent fuel and preferable to leaving large concentrations of spent fuel in cooling tanks.
The first dry storage installation in the US was licensed by the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) in 1986 at the [[Surry Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Virginia]], at {{coord|37.1630|-76.6861 |format=dms |type:landmark_region:US-VA_dim:200 |name= Surry Power Station spent fuel storage}}. Spent fuel is currently stored in dry cask systems at a growing number of power plant sites, and at an interim facility located at the [[Idaho National Laboratory]] near [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]]. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission estimates that many of the nuclear power plants in the [[United States]] will be out of room in their spent fuel pools by 2015, most likely requiring the use of temporary storage of some kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/waste/spent-fuel-storage/nuc-fuel-pool.html|title=NRC Graph of Spent Fuel Capacity|author=|date=|website=nrc.gov|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yucca Mountain was expected to open in 2017. However, on March&amp;nbsp;5, 2009, [[United States Secretary of Energy|Energy Secretary]] [[Steven Chu]] reiterated in a Senate hearing that the [[Yucca Mountain]] site was no longer considered an option for storing reactor waste.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, H. Josef. 2009. “[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-nuke-yucca_frimar06,0,2557502.story Nuclear waste won't be going to Nevada's Yucca Mountain, Obama official says].” ''Chicago Tribune''. March 6, 2009, 4. Accessed 2009-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 NRC guideline calls for fuels to have spent at least five years in a storage pool before being moved to dry casks. The industry norm is about 10 years.&lt;ref name="NRC-Spent-Fuel-Storage-FAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nrc2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/dry-cask-storage.html|publisher=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]]|date=May 7, 2009|title=Fact Sheet on Dry Cask Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel|accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NRC describes the dry casks used in the US as "designed to resist floods, tornadoes, projectiles, temperature extremes, and other unusual scenarios."&lt;ref name=nrc2/&gt;

As of the end of 2009, 13,856 metric tons of commercial spent fuel – or about 22 percent – were stored in dry casks.&lt;ref name="NRC-Spent-Fuel-Storage-FAQ" /&gt;

In the 1990s, the NRC had to “take repeated actions to address defective welds on dry casks that led to cracks and quality assurance problems; helium had leaked into some casks, increasing temperatures and causing accelerated fuel corrosion”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', World Scientific, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the zeroing of the budget for [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]] in Nevada, more [[nuclear waste]] is being loaded into sealed metal casks filled with inert gas. Many of these casks will be stored in coastal or lakeside regions where a salt air environment exists, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is studying how such dry casks perform in salt environments. Some hope that the casks can be used for 100 years, but cracking related to corrosion could occur in 30 years or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/researching-safer-nuclear-energy/ |title=Researching Safer Nuclear Energy |author=Matthew Wald |date=August 9, 2011 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Company videos, covering the processes and remote handling, from the initial fuel loading to the removal and eventual dry-cask storage, are viewable on various video hosting domains.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHvi5j5_uwQ Dry Fuel Storage (Yankee Rowe)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mILvWNgggfU Spent Fuel Storage at Diablo Canyon Power Plant]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, above-ground dry storage has been used. [[Ontario Power Generation]] is in the process of constructing a Dry Storage Cask storage facility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opg.com/pdf/darlinfopkg.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013140531/http://www.opg.com/pdf/DarlInfoPkg.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }} Ontario Power Generation ; Darlington Waste Management Facility&lt;/ref&gt; on its [[Darlington Nuclear Generating Station|Darlington]] site, which will be similar in many respects to existing facilities at [[Pickering Nuclear Generating Station]] and [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]]. [[New Brunswick Power Corporation|NB Power's]] [[Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station]] and [[Hydro-Québec|Hydro-Québec's]] [[Gentilly Nuclear Generating Station]] also both operate dry storage facilities.

=== Germany ===
[[File:Constor.JPG|thumb|right|Multipurpose Constor Storage, Transport, and Disposal Cask]]

A centralized storage facility using dry casks is located at [[Ahaus]].&lt;ref name=nap/&gt; As of 2011, it housed 311 casks; 305 from the [[Thorium High Temperature Reactor]], 3 from the [[Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant]], and 3 from the [[Gundremmingen Nuclear Power Plant]].&lt;ref name=nap/&gt; The transport from Gundremmingen to the Ahaus site met with considerable public protest and the power plant operators and the government later agreed to locate such casks at the powerplants.&lt;ref name=nap&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11263&amp;page=94|publisher=[[National Academies Press]]|title=Safety and Security of Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage: Public Report (2006) Board on Radioactive Waste Management (BRWM)|accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''CASTOR'' (''ca''sk for ''s''torage and ''t''ransport ''o''f ''r''adioactive material) is a trademarked brand of dry casks used to store [[spent nuclear fuel]] (a type of [[nuclear waste]]). CASTORs are manufactured by [[Gesellschaft für Nuklear-Service]] (GNS), a German provider of nuclear services.

''CONSTOR'' is a cask used for transport and long-term storage of spent fuel and high-level waste also manufactured by GNS. Its inner and outer layers are steel, enclosing a layer of [[concrete]].
A 9-meter [[drop test]] of the V/TC model was conducted in 2004; the results conformed to expectations.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bulgaria===
In 2008, officials at the [[Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant]] announced their intention to use 34 CONSTOR casks at the Kozloduy NPP site before the end of 2010.&lt;ref name=koz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kznpp.org/uf//buletini/2008/KNPP_2_08.pdf|title=The English Language Bulletin of Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant|year=2008|publisher=Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant Official Bulletin|accessdate=2010-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lithuania===
Spent fuel from the now-closed [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]] was placed in CASTOR and CONSTOR storage casks during the 2000s.&lt;ref name=lt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=18041752|title=Radiological and thermal characteristics of CASTOR RBMK-1500 and CONSTOR RBMK-1500 casks for spent nuclear fuel storage at ignalina Nuclear Power Plant|publisher=[[Hanser]], cited through CAT.INIST|year=2006|accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
The Russian dry storage facility for spent nuclear fuel, the HOT-2 at Mining Chemical Combine in [[Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai]] in Siberia, is not a 'cask' facility per se, as it is designed to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel (both [[VVER]] and [[RBMK]]) in a series of compartments. The structure of the facility is made up of monolithic reinforced concrete walls and top and bottom slabs, with the actual storage compartments formed by reinforced concrete partitions. The fuel is to be cooled by natural convection of air. The design capacity of the facility is 37,785 tonnes of uranium. It is now under construction and commissioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sibghk.ru/wps/wcm/connect/ghk/site/news/enterpriseNews/7744050046157b998cb98c9a323a0a1d |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302175421/http://www.sibghk.ru/wps/wcm/connect/ghk/site/news/enterpriseNews/7744050046157b998cb98c9a323a0a1d |archivedate=2014-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ukraine===
In Ukraine, a dry storage facility has been accepting spent fuel from the six-unit [[Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant]] ([[VVER-1000]] reactors) since 2001, making it the longest-serving such facility in the former Soviet Union. The system was designed by the now-defunct Duke Engineering of the United States, with the storage casks being manufactured locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duke-energy.com/news/releases/2001/Aug/2001082701.html|title=404 Page Not Found|author=|date=|website=Duke Energy|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another project is underway with [[Holtec International]] (again of the USA) to build a dry spent fuel storage facility at the 1986-accident-infamous [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] ([[RBMK-1000]] reactors). The project was initially started with Framatome (currently [[AREVA]]) of France, later suspended and terminated due to technical difficulties. Holtec was originally brought on board as a subcontractor to dehydrate the spent fuel, eventually taking over the entire project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070806005964/en/Holtec-International-Launches-Chernobyl-Dry-Storage-Project|title=Holtec International Launches the Chernobyl Dry Storage Project|author=|date=|website=businesswire.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5031">The '''Dual Revolution''' was a term first coined by [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. It refers specifically to the time period between 1789 and 1848 in which the political and ideological changes of the [[French Revolution]] fused with and reinforced the technological and economic changes of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The French Revolution, inspired by the ideals of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophy, spread ideas of [[democracy]], [[nationalism]], and [[liberalism]]. These political ideas were fused with the new technological advances of the industrial revolution such as the [[spinning jenny]], [[steam engine]]s, and the [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]]. With the defeat of the French Revolution and subsequently the [[Congress of Vienna]], [[Klemens von Metternich|Metternich]] constructed a [[European balance of power|balance of power in Europe]] that would prevent one country from gaining too much power. This set the framework for a strong conservative, reactionary stance against the ideas of nationalism and liberalism spread by the dual revolution. The [[Holy Alliance]], formed by Austria, Prussia and Russia in September 1815 became a symbol of oppression to the ideas spread by the Dual Revolution.

==Industrial Revolution==
Generally, [[Industrial Revolution]] means transitioning from hand produced to machines. In the case of the dual revolution, the Industrial portion was more from social scientists like Count Henri de Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier, Louis Blanc, Pierre Joseph Proudhon, and Karl Marx who attempted to come up with ideas for “utopias”, conservative and socialist societies.

==French Revolution==
The [[French Revolution]] began in 1789 with the [[Tennis Court Oath]], by which the members of the third estate, who had been locked out of the meeting the estates general, gathered together and swore not to disband until they had written a new constitution. Inspired by the ideas of Enlightenment Philosophers, most prominently [[Rousseau]] and his social contract, the National assembly, those who had sworn the tennis court oath, published the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]]. The Declaration of the Rights of Man was very much an expression of Enlightenment ideals. A major portion of the Declaration was dedicated to the natural rights of man. According to the Declaration every man is entitled to life, liberty and property. This is a reflection of the beliefs of John Locke who wrote the 2nd treatise of civil government. The [[Committee of Public Safety]], headed by [[Robespierre]], which rose to power after using the sans culotte to imprison the other members of the Jacobin club, was based on Rousseau's Social Contracts idea of the general will. Rousseau states that at times people have to sacrifice their natural rights for the greater good which is represented by the [[General Will]]. The General Will is not necessarily represented by the majority, a far-seeing minority can represent the general will. Robespierre believed that the Committee of Public Safety represented the general will. Robespierre used an aggressive revolutionary purge of those who opposed the Committee called the Terror, a planned economy, and French Nationalism inspired by the revolution to increase French military size and push armies into most of western Europe.

===Nationalism===
Nationalism was a driving force for European politics after the French revolution. The ideas of Nationalism emphasized both national pride and that each nation, which consists of a people of the same culture and language should coincide with the boundaries of the state. Metternich, the Austrian Chancellor, was conservative precisely because nationalism was very dangerous to the massive, multi-ethnic Austria. Increased national identity and pride garnered from the successes of ones country were another reason for increased European colonialism during the later parts of the 19th century.

===Liberalism===
Liberalism was a major movement post French Revolution. It was an expression of enlightenment ideals. Liberals believed in freedom of the press, freedom of speech, civil rights, fair elections, capitalism, freedom of religion and private property. Ideas of liberalism greatly influenced the 1848 revolutions which were led by students and the middle class.

===Conservatism===
Conservatism is based on traditional strategies like absolute monarchies. It is a reactionary stance against the ideas spread by the dual revolution. Conservatism is closely linked to Classicism.

[[File:Fireplace poker.jpg|right|thumb|80px|A fancy brass fireplace poker.]]
[[File:Hand made fire stoker.jpg|thumb|250px|Freshly forged iron fireplace pokers.]]
A '''fire iron''' is any metal instrument for tending a fire.

==Types==
There are three types of tools commonly used to tend a small [[fire]], such as an indoor fireplace fire or [[yule log]], the [[spade]], the [[tongs]] and the poker itself. These tools make it possible to handle a fire without risk of [[burn (injury)|burns]] or [[blister]]s.

A '''fireplace poker''', (also known as a '''fire iron''') is a short, rigid rod made of fireproof material used to adjust [[coal]] and [[wood fuel]] burning in a [[fireplace]], and can be used to stir up a fire. A fireplace poker is usually [[metal]]lic and has a point at one end for pushing burning materials (or a hook for pulling/raking, or a combination) and a handle at the opposite end, sometimes with an [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] grip. [[Iron]] is the most popular [[metal]] from which the pokers are wrought. [[Brass]] is a more expensive alternative for a home poker set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blacksmith Fundamentals|url=http://www.metalwebnews.com/howto/blacksmith/farmshop.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''slice bar''' has a flatter tip and can be used to stir up the fire or to clear the grates of ashes. 
Other fires irons include the [[fire rake]] (not to be confused with the [[Fire rake|firefighter's tool]]), '''fire tongs''' and '''fire shovel'''.

Many fireplace sets also include a small broom for sweeping up ash.

=== Japan ===                                                                                                                            
In Japan, traditional fire-tending device for a Japanese [[brazier]] (''[[hibachi]]'') is a pair of long metal chopsticks, called {{Nihongo||[[:ja:火箸|火箸]]|hibashi|fire chopsticks}}, used to pick up and manipulate the [[charcoal]].

==Outdoor use==
Large [[bonfire]]s are not amenable to the use of [[tool]]s of the size commonly used in an indoor fireplace. However some individuals have been known to [[welding|weld]] [[rebar]] into clever shapes to move the wood in a moderately large bonfire.

== Steam locomotives ==
As a steam locomotive runs, by-products are produced by the coal fire such as ash and clinker. If these waste products are allowed to build up in the fire, it would have an adverse effect on the performance of the locomotive. A fireman will employ various fire irons in order to clean the fire, whilst the locomotive stands. Below is a list of different types of fire iron that would typically be carried aboard a locomotive during operation. Note: not all the fire irons listed would be carried at once, only the ones needed:

* '''dart:''' The dart is a long straight fire iron that is used to break up coal that has caked together or to search for clinker
* '''curved iron:''' The curved iron is a fire iron that is curved at the end. It is used to manipulate the fire so as to remove ash and clinker. This can be accomplished by either moving the good fire to one side so ash and clinker may be accessed or it may be used to knock ash through the ash pan without disturbing the fire.
* '''t-iron:''' The t-iron has the same function as the curved iron, the main difference being it has a curved stem allowing the fireman to clean underneath the fire door. 
* '''clinker shovel''': The clinker shovel is employed to removed clinker or other waste products that are too large to fit through the gaps in the firebars. It may also be employed to remove cold waste products before lighting a new fire.
* '''ashpan rake:''' The ashpan rake has a metal piece attached to the end of a rod and is used to withdraw ash from the ashpan to prevent it from becoming clogged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Steam-Locomotive-Works-Guide/dp/0711038147|title=How a Steam Locomotive Works: a New Guide|last=results|first=search|date=2015-03-12|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|year=|isbn=9780711038141|location=|pages=36-37|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest and most primitive pokers were likely made from the same material as the fuel (that is, wood in the form of a hefty branch). This ''[[ersatz]]'' wooden-type fire-tool may be called a poker or a "firestick" in colloquial [[terminology]]. The first{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} successful mass production of stokers as a part of an entire fireplace-regalia set was designed and manufactured in [[Cape Girardeau]], [[Missouri]] by the RL Hendrickson Manufacturing Corporation in 1898 at a cost of [[USD|US$]]1. Today, one of the sets in fair condition can garner more than US$3500 at [[auction]].

'''Focke's wind tunnel''' is a fully operational wind tunnel in the former private laboratory of the aviation pioneer [[Henrich Focke]] (1890&amp;ndash;1979), co-founder of [[Focke-Wulf]] and designer of the first fully controllable helicopter, the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 61]]. Henrich Focke built the laboratory in 1960 at the age of 70 in the city of [[Bremen]].
Until shortly before his death, in 1979, Focke continued aerodynamic studies in slow flight characteristics and the stability problem of helicopters. The rediscovery of his aerodynamic laboratory, together with its wind tunnel was regarded as a sensation for science and technology. Since 2004, the technical monument Focke Flight Laboratory is protected by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{WP-HB LfD|1157|Database of Landesamt für Denkmalpflege Bremen #1157}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==

The lab was discovered in 1997 by Kai Steffen, after having read the memoirs of Henrich Focke, the former graduate student searched for the missing wind tunnel, contacting the Focke family and finding the laboratory in a backyard shed near the main station of Bremen. The laboratory had not been entered by anyone for about 20 years.

The wind tunnel is a closed recirculating wind tunnel for [[subsonic and transonic wind tunnel|subsonic speed range]], produces wind speeds up to 16 m per second and is still fully functional. The simplicity of the instrumentation is demonstrated by the use of kitchen scales to measure the forces acting in the wind tunnel, stove pipes and curtains controlling the airflow and reducing swirl. Everything in this lab was still in place, as the 85-year-old Henrich Focke had left it, but the building was not in good condition.

[[File:Fockewindkanalnach.jpg|thumb|Museum and laboratory in the year 2006]]

== Museum ==

After renovation of the building and the restoration of the wind tunnel, the laboratory is now shown as Henrich Focke used it until 1975, with scientific experiments carried out by schools and universities.

The museum was opened in 2005, but the aerodynamic laboratory was not fully repaired until the Autumn of 2008. In addition, modern measurement technology, using a personal computer and electronic pressure cells, was installed.

A '''ghodiyu''' is an infant [[Bassinet|cradle]] formed of a wooden frame and a cloth hammock (''jholi'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cF7rAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ghodiyu&amp;dq=Ghodiyu&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MIvGmlZIdR&amp;sig=U_YX3bFMyxkjyxqB2IIuw7irm10&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zJ1gUKu9J-SH0QGhh4CoBg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA |title=Mārg̲: a magazine of the arts - Modern Artists and Architects Research Group, National Centre for the Performing Arts (India) - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device originated in [[Gujarat]], [[India]] to help babies sleep. People in India have used this type of device for hundreds of years so that their baby can fall asleep quickly and get the rest they need while developing proper sleeping habits.  A similar functioning device from the South India is called a '''jhula'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JuOiQbmo2CQC|title = No Five Fingers are Alike: Cognitive Amplifiers in Social Context|last = Berland|first = Joseph C.|date = 1982-01-01|publisher = Harvard University Press|isbn = 9780674625402|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''parnu'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GRR5aUwQUVsC|title = The Mahyavanshi: The Success Story of a Scheduled Caste|last = Parmar|first = Y.

==Construction==
A ghodiyu is a swing framework with a pair of legs on two ends of middle rod. This was originally made of wood (called ''sankheda''), however, in modern times strong and durable material such as stainless steel is used during the manufacturing. The frame is often hooked onto a [[hammock]] which harnesses the young baby.

Typically, a ghodiyu is designed to have a low [[center of gravity]]. This enables a person to swing the child back and forth.

==Usage==
Indian people believe that the rocking motion soothes and relaxes the child and puts them to sleep quickly by replicating the comfort and security of the womb. Indian mothers claim that using a ghodiyu for their child can relieve [[baby colic]] symptoms due to the rocking motion which they believe relaxes the baby.

The '''grain trade''' refers to the local and international [[trade]] in [[cereal]]s and other [[food grain]]s such as [[wheat]], [[maize]], and [[rice]].

==History==
[[File:Grenier-égyptien-maspero.png|thumb|Ancient Egyptian art depicting a worker filling a grain silo]]
[[File:Ancientgrain.png|thumb|Ancient Roman grain]]The grain trade is probably nearly as old as [[agriculture|grain growing]], going back the [[Neolithic Revolution]] ( around 11,500 BC ).  Wherever there is a scarcity of land (e.g. cities) people must bring in food from outside to sustain themselves, either by force or by trade.  However, many farmers throughout history (and today) have operated at the [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence level]], meaning they produce for household needs and have little leftover to trade.  The goal for such farmers in not to specialize in one crop and grow a surplus of it, but rather to produce everything his family needs and become [[self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]].  Only in places and eras where production is geared towards producing a surplus for trade ([[commercial agriculture]]), does a major grain trade become possible.

Early trade was most likely by [[barter]], and because hauling large amounts of grain around was so difficult with ancient technology, the trade was probably quite limited in terms of the volume traded and the area moved.  The development of the [[History of money|money economy]] and the [[wheel]] would have facilitated a much more expansive trade.

In the ancient world, grain regularly flowed from the [[hinterland]]s to the [[Core-periphery|core]]s of great empires:  maize in [[History of Mexico|ancient Mexico]], rice in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], and wheat and [[barley]] in the [[ancient Near East]].  With this came improving technologies for storing and transporting grains; the [[Hebrew Bible]] makes frequent mention to [[ancient Egypt]]'s massive grain [[silo]]s.

During the classical age, the unification of [[Qin (state)|China]] and the pacification of the [[Mediterranean]] basin by the [[Roman Empire]] created vast regional markets in commodities at either end of Eurasia.  The [[grain supply to the city of Rome]] was considered by be of the utmost strategic importance to Roman generals and politicians.

In Europe with the collapse of the Roman system and the rise of [[feudalism]] many farmers were reduced to a subsistence level, producing only enough to fulfill their obligation to their [[lord]] and [[tithe|the Church]], with little for themselves, and even less for trade.  The little that was traded was moved around locally at regular [[fair]]s.

A massive expansion in the grain trade occurred when Europeans were able to bring millions of square kilometers of new land under cultivation in [[the Americas]], Russia, and Australia, in an expansion starting in the fifteenth and lasting into the twentieth century.  In addition the [[Enclosure|consolidation of farmland in Britain]] and [[Magnate|Eastern Europe]], and the development of the [[railway]] and [[steam ship]] shifted trade from local to more international patterns.

During this time debate over [[tariff]]s and [[free trade]] in grain was fierce.  Poor industrial workers relied on cheap bread for sustenance, but farmers wanted their government to create a higher local price to [[protectionism|protect them from cheap foreign imports]], Britain's famous [[Corn Laws]] being an example.

[[File:Tab, Indiana - Railroad.png|thumb|right|A [[grain elevator]] in [[Indiana]], United States]]As Britain and other European countries industrialized and urbanized they became net importers of grain from the various [[breadbasket]]s of the world.  In many parts of Europe as [[serfdom]] was abolished, great estates were accompanied by many inefficient [[smallholding]]s, but in the newly colonized regions massive operations were available to the average farmer and not only great nobles.  In the United States and Canada the [[Homestead Act]] and the [[Dominion Lands Act]] allowed pioneers on [[Interior Plains|the western plains]] to gain tracts of {{convert|180|acre|km2}} or more for little or no fee.  This moved grain growing, and hence trading, to a much more massive scale.  Huge [[grain elevator]]s were built to take in farmers' produce and move it out via the railways to port.  Transportation costs were a major concern for farmers in remote regions, however, and any technology that allowed the easier movement of grain was of great assistance, meanwhile farmers in Europe struggled to remain competitive while operating on a much smaller scale and in [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Agriculture in the United States|farmers of the United States]] have met a greatly increased output from [[Agriculture in Canada|Canada]], the cost of transport from that country to England being much the same as from the United States in the 20th century. So much improved is the position of the farmer in North America compared with what it was about 1870, that the transport companies in 1901 carried 17¾ [[bushel]]s of his grain to the seaboard in exchange for the value of one bushel, whereas in 1867 he had to give up one bushel in every six in return for the service.

As regards with the [[Agriculture in the United Kingdom|British farmer]], it does not appear as if he had improved his position; for he has to send his wheat to greater distances, owing to the collapse of many country [[Mill (grinding)|mill]]ers or their removal to the seaboard, while railway rates have fallen only to a very small extent; again the farmers wheat is worth only half of what it was formerly; it may be said that the British farmer has to give up one bushel in nine to the railway company for the purpose of transportation, whereas in the seventies he gave up one in eighteen only. Enough has been said to prove that the advantage of position claimed for the British farmer by Caird was somewhat illusory. Speaking broadly, the [[Kansas]] or [[Minnesota]] farmers wheat does not have to pay for carriage to [[Liverpool]] more than 2[[shilling|s]]. 6[[pence|d]]. to 7s. 6d. per [[ton]] in excess of the rate paid by a [[Yorkshire]] farmer; this, it will be admitted, does not go very far towards enabling the latter to pay [[renting|rent]], [[tithe]]s and rates and [[tax]]es.
- [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
[[File:Minneapolis-Grain-Exchange-1939-bidding.jpg|left|thumb|Bidders at the [[Minneapolis Grain Exchange]] in 1939]]
In the 1920s and '30s farmers in Australia and Canada reacted against the [[pricing power]] of the large grain-handling and shipping companies.  Their governments created the [[Australian Wheat Board]] and [[Canadian Wheat Board]] as [[monopsony]] [[marketing board]]s, buying all the wheat in those countries for export.  Together those two boards controlled a large percentage of the world's grain trade in the mid-20th century.  Additionally, farmers' cooperatives such the [[wheat pools]] became a popular alternative to the major grain companies.

At the same time in the [[Soviet Union]] and soon after in [[People's Republic of China|China]], disastrous [[collectivization]] programs effectively turned the world's largest farming nations into net importers of grain.

By the second half of the 20th century, the grain trade was divided between a few state-owned and privately owned giants.  The state giants were [[Exportkhleb]] of the Soviet Union, the Canadian Wheat Board, the Australian Wheat Board, the [[Australian Barley Board]], and so on.  The largest private companies, known as the "big five", were [[Cargill]], [[Continental Grain|Continental]], [[Louis Dreyfus Group|Louis Dreyfus]], [[Bunge Limited|Bunge]], and Andre, an older European company not to be confused with the more recent [[André Maggi Group]] from Brazil.

In 1972, the Soviet Union's wheat crop failed.  To prevent shortages in their own country, Soviet authorities were able to buy most of the surplus American harvest through private companies without the knowledge of the United States government.  This drove up prices across the world, and was dubbed the "[[great grain robbery]]" by critics, leading to greater public attention being paid by Americans to the large trading companies.

By contrast in 1980 the US government attempted to use its [[food power]] to punish the Soviet Union for its invasion of Afghanistan with a [[United States grain embargo against the Soviet Union|embargo on grain exports]].  This was seen as a failure in terms of foreign policy (the Soviets made up the deficit on the international market) and negatively impacted American farmers.

==Modern trade==
[[File:Bulk carrier arriving in port.jpg|thumb|While once grain was sold by the sack, it is now moved in [[Bulk cargo|bulk]] in huge ships like this.]]
Since the Second World War, the trend  in North America has been toward further consolidation of already vast farms.  Transportation infrastructure has also promoted more [[economies of scale]]. Railways have switched from coal to diesel fuel, and introduced [[hopper car]] to carry more mass with less effort.  The old wooden grain elevators have been replaced by massive concrete inland terminals, and rail transportation has retreated in the face of ever larger [[truck]]s.

Farmers in the [[European Union]], United States and Japan are protected by [[agricultural subsidies]].  The European Union's programs are organized under the [[Common Agricultural Policy]]. The [[agricultural policy of the United States]] is demonstrated through the [[United States farm bill|"farm bill"]], while [[rice production in Japan]] is also protected and subsidized.  Farmers in other countries has attempted to have these policies disallowed by the [[World Trade Organization]], or attempted to negotiate them away though the [[Cairns Group]], at the same time the wheat boards have been reformed and many tariffs have been greatly reduced, leading to a further [[globalization]] of the industry.  For example, in 2008 Mexico was required by the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) to remove its tariffs on US and Canadian [[maize]].

[[File:JNR HO KI 2226.JPG|thumb|left|Hopper-bottomed railcars, such are this one from Japan, have made moving grain much faster and less labour-intensive.]] Modern issues affecting the grain trade include [[food security]] concerns, the increasing use of [[biofuels]], the controversy over how to properly store and separate [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] and [[organic food|organic]] crops, the [[local food]] movement, the desire of developing countries to achieve [[market access]] in industrialized economies, [[climate change]] and drought shifting agricultural patterns, and the development of new crops.
"Price volatility is a life-and-death issue for many people around the world" warned [[ICTSD]] Senior Fellow Sergio Marchi. "Trade policies need to incentivise investment in developing country agriculture, so that poor farmers can build resistance to future price shocks".&lt;ref name="ictsd"&gt;[http://ictsd.org/i/agriculture/76996/ Food price spikes put the spotlight on the need for sustained commitment to agriculture], International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development, 1 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology (formerly Indian Institute of Crop Processing Technology)''' (IIFPT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/from-crop-to-food-processing-technology-the-scope-gets-wider/article17755599.ece|title=From crop to food processing technology, the scope gets wider|website=www.thehindu.com|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a pioneer Educational and R&amp;D Institution under the [[Ministry of Food Processing Industries]] (MoFPI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.iifpt.edu.in/pages/about-us.html|work=Website|publisher=IIFPT, Thanjavur|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The IIFPT is located on a 15-acre campus in Thanjavur to Pudukkottai Highway located at a distance of 2&amp;nbsp;km from Thanjavur New Bustand.

==History==
The Institute was organized in 1967 as R&amp;D laboratory in the Modern Rice Mill Complex of Thanjavur Co-operative Marketing Federation (TCMF) at [[Thiruvarur]] and aimed at preserving high moisture paddy, since the harvest season in Thanjavur District coincided with the end of the monsoon season.

In 1972, the institute was upgraded and named the Paddy Processing Research Centre (PPRC). At the time of upgrading the mandates of the institute were also changed and the research focussed on identifying post harvest processing and preservation technology for paddy. PPRC then moved into its current location in [[Thanjavur]]

Considering the vital importance of strengthening R&amp;D efforts in the post harvest processing of foods, MoFPI strengthened and upgraded the PPRC as a National Level Institute. In February 2008 the institute was upgraded as a National Institute and renamed as the Indian Institute of Crop Processing Technology.

'''Infineon Technologies AG''' is a [[Germans|German]] semiconductor manufacturer founded on 1 April 1999, when the [[semiconductor]] operations of the parent company [[Siemens|Siemens AG]] were spun off to form a separate legal entity. As of 30 September 2016, Infineon had 36,299 employees worldwide. In fiscal year 2016, the company achieved sales of €6.473 billion.&lt;ref name="FD2016" /&gt;

On 1 May 2006, Infineon's Memory Products division was carved out as a distinct company called [[Qimonda|Qimonda AG]], which at its height employed about 13,500 people worldwide. Qimonda was listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] until 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nyse.com/press/1232709551165.html|title=NYSE Suspends Qimonda AG, Moves to Remove from the List|publisher=[[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]]|author=NYSE Regulation, Inc.|date=23 January 2009|accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Markets ==
Infineon Technologies AG, in [[Neubiberg]] near [[Munich]], offers semiconductors and systems for [[automotive]], industrial, and multimarket sectors, as well as chipcard and security products. With a global presence, Infineon operates through its subsidiaries in the USA, from [[Milpitas]], California, and in the Asia-Pacific region, from [[Singapore]] and from Tokyo, Japan.

Infineon has a number of facilities in Europe, one in [[Dresden]], Germany, Europe's microelectronic, and emerging technologies center. Infineon's high power segment is in [[Warstein]], Germany; [[Villach]] and [[Graz]] in Austria; [[Cegléd]] in Hungary; and Italy.

There's also a Shared Service Center in Maia, Portugal.

Infineon is listed in the [[DAX]] index of the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]].

In 2010, a [[proxy contest]] broke out in advance of the impending shareholders' meeting over whether board member [[Klaus Wucherer]] would be allowed to step into the chairman's office upon the retirement of the then-current chairman Max Dietrich Kley.

After several restructurings,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infineon.com/cms/en/corporate/press/news/releases/2011/INFXX201110-008.html&lt;/ref&gt; Infineon today comprises four business areas:

=== Automotive (ATV)===
Infineon provides semiconductor products for use in [[powertrain]]s (engine and transmission control), comfort electronics (e.g., steering, [[shock absorber]]s, [[air conditioning]]) as well as in safety systems ([[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[airbag]]s, [[Electronic stability control|ESP]]). The product portfolio includes [[microcontroller]]s, power [[semiconductor]]s and [[sensor]]s. In fiscal year 2013 (ending September), sales amounted to €1,714 million for the ATV segment.

=== Industrial Power Control (IPC) ===
The industrial division of the company includes power semiconductors and modules which are used for generation, transmission and consumption of electrical energy. Its application areas include control of electric drives for industrial applications and household appliances, modules for renewable energy production, conversion and transmission. This segment achieved sales of €651 million in fiscal year 2013.

=== Power Management &amp; Multimarket (PMM) ===
The division Power Management &amp; Control sums up the business with semiconductor components for efficient power management or high-frequency applications. Those find application in lighting management systems and LED lighting, power supplies for servers, PCs, notebooks and consumer electronics, custom devices for peripheral devices, game consoles, applications in medical technology, high-frequency components having a protective function for communication and tuner systems and silicon MEMS microphones. In fiscal year 2013 PMM generated €987 million.

=== Chip Card &amp; Security (CCS) ===
The CCS business provides microcontrollers for mobile phone SIM cards, payment cards, security chips and chip-based solutions for passports, identity cards and other official documents. Infineon delivers a significant number of chips for the new German identity card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerwoche.de/security/2359712/ |title=Infineon chips for the new identity cards |publisher= Computerwoche.de |language=German |accessdate= 7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, CCS provides solutions for applications with high security requirements such as pay television and Trusted Computing. CCS achieved €463 million in fiscal year 2013. "''Infineon is the number 1 in embedded security"'' (IHS, 2016 – IHS Embedded Digital Security Report).

== Acquisitions and divestitures ==
The former memory chip division was carved out in 2006 as Infineon’s subsidiary Qimonda, of which Infineon last held a little over three quarters. In January 2009, Qimonda filed for bankruptcy with the district court in Munich.

On 7 July 2009, Infineon Technologies AG agreed by contract with the U.S. investor Golden Gate Capital on the sale of its Wireline Communications for €250 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infineon.com/cms/de/corporate/press/news/releases/2009/INFXX200906-067.html&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting new company is now known as [[Lantiq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elektroniknet.de/home/kommunikation/news/n/d/infineon-wireline-wird-lantiq |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327083942/http://www.elektroniknet.de/home/kommunikation/news/n/d/infineon-wireline-wird-lantiq/ |archivedate=27 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 2011, the sale of the business segment of wireless solutions to [[Intel]] was completed. The resulting new company has approximately 3,500 employees and now operates as [[Intel Mobile Communications]] (IMC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infineon.com/cms/de/corporate/press/news/releases/2011/INFXX201101-018.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infineon.com/cms/de/corporate/press/news/releases/2010/INFXX201008-069.html |title=Intel buys Wireless Solutions section from Infineon |publisher=Infineon.com |accessdate= 11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
On 18 May 2016 Infineon decided to reinforce the management board and therefore added a new, 4th member to the board of directors. From July 1, 2016 the board of directors consists of:

Reinhard Ploss, CEO

Dominik Asam, CFO

Helmut Gassel,  Sales and Marketing

Jochen Hanebeck, Operations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/press/press-releases/2016/INFXX201605-059.html|title=Infineon reinforces the Management Board to continue the successful growth strategy - Infineon Technologies|last=AG|first=Infineon Technologies|website=www.infineon.com|access-date=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investors ==
Major institutional investors in Infineon are: [[Dodge &amp; Cox|Dodge and Cox International Stock Fund]]: 9.82%, [[BlackRock|BlackRock, Inc.]]: 5.10%, [[Capital Research and Management]]: 5.09%, [[UBS|UBS AG]]: 3.28%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infineon.com/cms/en/corporate/investor/infineon-share/shareholder-structure.html |title=Shareholder Structure |publisher=Infineon.com |accessdate= 14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2004&amp;ndash;2005, an investigation was carried out into a worldwide [[DRAM price fixing]] conspiracy during 1999&amp;ndash;2002 that damaged competition and raised PC prices. As a result, [[Samsung]] is to pay $300 million fine, [[Hynix]] was to pay $185 million in 2005, [[Infineon]]: $160 million in 2004. [[Micron Technology]] cooperated with prosecutors and no fine is expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2566841/technology-law-regulation/infineon-to-pay--160m-fine-for-dram-price-fixing.html | title=Infineon to pay $160M fine for DRAM price-fixing | first=Grant | last=Gross | date=15 September 2004 | work=[[Computerworld]] |publisher=[[IDG]] | accessdate=23 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security flaw==
In October 2017, it was reported that a flaw, dubbed [[ROCA vulnerability|ROCA]], in a code library developed by Infineon, which had been in widespread use in security products such as [[smartcard]]s and [[Trusted Platform Module|TPM]]s, enabled private keys to be inferred from [[public key cryptography|public keys]]. As a result, all systems depending upon the privacy of such keys were vulnerable to compromise, such as identity theft or spoofing. Affected systems include 750,000 [[Estonian national ID card]]s, 300,000 [[Slovak identity card|Slovak national ID card]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Slovak ID card security risk exposed |url=http://enrsi.rtvs.sk/articles/news/145779/slovak-id-card-security-risk-exposed |last=Gavin |first=Shoebridge |date=18 October 2017 |publisher=RTVS |accessdate=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and computers that use Microsoft [[BitLocker]] drive encryption in conjunction with an affected TPM.&lt;ref name="ars20171016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goodin |first1=Dan |title=Millions of high-security crypto keys crippled by newly discovered flaw |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/10/crypto-failure-cripples-millions-of-high-security-keys-750k-estonian-ids/ |work=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=16 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft released an updated version of the firmware for Infineon TPM chips that fixes the flaw via Windows Update.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Infineon says has fixed encryption flaw found by researchers |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-infineon-cyber/infineon-says-has-fixed-encryption-flaw-found-by-researchers-idUSKBN1CL2KC |last=Busvine |first=Douglas |date=16 October 2017 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ink jet material deposition''' is an emerging manufacturing technique in which [[Inkjet printer|ink jet technology]] is used to deposit materials on [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]]s. The technique aims to eliminate fixed costs of production and reduce the amount of materials used.

==Uses==
Anything that is produced using traditional printing techniques is a candidate for ink jet material deposition. In addition, the precision available with ink jet technology may be required for some industrial applications. Examples include:

* [[Organic light-emitting diode]] display production.
* [[Printed circuit board]]s are typically produced using [[Screen-printing|screen printing]], which is not cost-effective for prototyping or small production runs. [[Conductive ink]] can be used to create circuit traces.

==Advantages==
* Since the underlying technology is digital, startup costs of production are relatively low. Each copy produced may be different from the last.
* Expensive materials may be used more efficiently; no material is wasted by placing it where it doesn't need to go.

==Disadvantages==
* The material to be jetted must be compatible with the print head used and must have its viscosity within a specific range.

==See also==
* [[Inkjet technology]]

Beams 1898 – 1977]&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, he worked on the [[Manhattan Project]], where his ultracentrifuge was used to demonstrate the separation of the uranium isotope U-235 from other isotopes. Officials in charge of the atomic bomb project concluded, however, that Beams's centrifuges were not as likely as other methods to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a bomb in the time available, and the centrifuge program was abandoned. After World War II, centrifuge separation of uranium isotopes was perfected by German scientists and engineers working in the Soviet Union. In 1953 Beams was appointed the Francis H. Smith Professor of Physics at the University of Virginia. Beams was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1967 for his work on the ultracentrifuge.&lt;ref name="nsm"&gt;{{cite book

A '''lock-in amplifier''' is a type of [[amplifier]] that can extract a [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]] with a known [[carrier wave]] from an extremely noisy environment. Depending on the dynamic reserve of the instrument, signals up to 1 million times smaller than noise components, potentially fairly close by in frequency, can still be reliably detected. It is essentially a [[homodyne detection|homodyne detector]] followed by [[low-pass filter]] that is often adjustable in cut-off frequency and filter order. Whereas traditional lock-in amplifiers use analog [[frequency mixer]]s and [[RC filter]]s for the demodulation, state-of-the-art instruments have both steps implemented by fast [[digital signal processing]], for example, on an [[FPGA]]. Usually sine and cosine demodulation is performed simultaneously, which is sometimes also referred to as dual-phase demodulation. This allows the extraction of the in-phase and the quadrature component that can then be transferred into polar coordinates, i.e. amplitude and phase, or further processed as real and imaginary part of a complex number (e.g. for complex [[FFT]] analysis).

The device is often used to measure [[phase shift]], even when the signals are large and of high [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and do not need further improvement.

Recovering signals at low signal-to-noise ratios requires a strong, clean reference signal with the same frequency as the received signal. This is not the case in many experiments, so the instrument can recover signals buried in the noise only in a limited set of circumstances.

The lock-in amplifier is commonly believed to be invented by [[Princeton University]] physicist [[Robert H. Dicke]] who founded the company Princeton Applied Research (PAR) to market the product. However, in an interview with [[Martin Harwit]], Dicke claims that even though he is often credited with the invention of the device, he believes that he read about it in a review of scientific equipment written by [[Walter C. Michels]], a professor at [[Bryn Mawr College]].&lt;ref name=Dicke1985&gt;[https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/4572 Oral History Transcript — Dr. Robert Dicke].&lt;/ref&gt; This could have been a 1941 article by Michels and Curtis,&lt;ref name=Michels1941&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Michels | first1 = W.

A. Stutt in 1949.&lt;ref name=Stutt1949&gt;Stutt, C. A. (1949). [http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/4940 "Low-frequency spectrum of lock-in amplifiers"]. MIT Technical Report (MIT) (105): 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic principles ==
The operation of a lock-in amplifier relies on the [[Orthogonal functions|orthogonality]] of [[sinusoidal function]]s. Specifically, when a sinusoidal function of frequency ''f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is multiplied by another sinusoidal function of frequency ''f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' not equal to ''f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and [[integral|integrated]] over a time much longer than the period of the two functions, the result is zero. Instead, when ''f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is equal to ''f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the two functions are in phase, the average value is equal to half of the product of the amplitudes.

In essence, a lock-in amplifier takes the input signal, [[product detector|multiplies]] it by the reference signal (either provided from the internal [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]] or an external source), and integrates it over a specified time, usually on the order of milliseconds to a few seconds. The resulting signal is a DC signal, where the contribution from any signal that is not at the same frequency as the reference signal is [[attenuation|attenuated]] close to zero. The [[Quadrature phase|out-of-phase component]] of the signal that has the same frequency as the reference signal is also attenuated (because sine functions are orthogonal to the cosine functions of the same frequency), making a lock-in a phase-sensitive detector.

For a sine reference signal and an input waveform &lt;math&gt;U_\text{in}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the DC output signal &lt;math&gt;U_\text{out}(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated for an analog lock-in amplifier as
:&lt;math&gt;U_\text{out}(t) = \frac{1}{T} \int_{t-T}^t \sin\left[2\pi f_\text{ref} \cdot s + \varphi\right] U_\text{in}(s) \,ds,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''φ'' is a phase that can be set on the lock-in (set to zero by default).

If the averaging time ''T'' is large enough (e.g. much larger than the signal period) to suppress all unwanted parts like noise and the variations at twice the reference frequency, the output is 
:&lt;math&gt;U_\text{out} = \frac{1}{2} V_\text{sig} \cos\theta,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V_\text{sig}&lt;/math&gt; is the signal amplitude at the reference frequency, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the phase difference between the signal and reference.

Many applications of the lock-in amplifier only require recovering the signal amplitude rather than relative phase to the reference signal. For a simple so called single-phase lock-in-amplifier the phase difference is adjusted (usually manually) to zero to get the full signal.

More advanced, so called two-phase lock-in-amplifiers have a second detector, doing the same calculation as before, but with an additional 90° phase shift. Thus one has two outputs: &lt;math&gt;X = V_\text{sig} \cos\theta&lt;/math&gt; is called the "in-phase" component, and &lt;math&gt;Y = V_\text{sig} \sin\theta&lt;/math&gt; the "quadrature" component. These two quantities represent the signal as a vector relative to the lock-in reference oscillator.  By computing the magnitude (''R'') of the signal vector, the phase dependency is removed:
:&lt;math&gt;R = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2} = V_\text{sig}.&lt;/math&gt;

The phase can be calculated from
:&lt;math&gt; \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{Y}{X}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

== Digital lock-in amplifiers ==
The majority of today's lock-in amplifiers are based on high-performance [[digital signal processing]] (DSP). Over the last 20 years, digital lock-in amplifiers have been replacing analog models across the entire frequency range, allowing users to perform measurements up to a frequency of 600 MHz. Initial problems of the first digital lock-in amplifiers, e.g. the presence of digital clock noise on the input connectors, could be completely eliminated by use of improved electronic components and better instrument design. Today's digital lock-in amplifiers outperform analog models in all relevant performance parameters, such as frequency range, input noise, stability and dynamic reserve. In addition to better performance, digital lock-in amplifiers can include multiple demodulators, which allows analyzing a signal with different filter settings or at multiple different frequencies simultaneously. Moreover, experimental data can be analyzed with additional tools such as an [[oscilloscope]], FFT spectrum analyzers, [[boxcar averager]] or used to provide feedback by using internal [[PID controller|PID controllers]]. Some models of the digital lock-in amplifiers are computer-controlled and feature a [[graphical user interface]] (can be a platform-independent [[browser user interface]]) and a choice of [[Application programming interface|programming interfaces]].

== Signal measurement in noisy environments ==
[[File:Lock-in amplifier experimental setup.svg|thumb|Typical experimental setup]]
Signal recovery takes advantage of the fact that [[Electronic noise|noise]] is often spread over a much wider range of frequencies than the signal. In the simplest case of white noise, even if the [[root mean square]] of noise is 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; times as large as the signal to be recovered, if the bandwidth of the measurement instrument can be reduced by a factor much greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; around the signal frequency, then the equipment can be relatively insensitive to the noise. In a typical 100&amp;nbsp;MHz bandwidth (e.g. an oscilloscope), a bandpass filter with width much narrower than 100&amp;nbsp;Hz would accomplish this. The averaging time of the lock-in amplifier determines the bandwidth and allows very narrow filters, less than 1&amp;nbsp;Hz if needed. However, this comes at the price of a slow response to changes in the signal.

In summary, even when noise and signal are indistinguishable in the [[time domain]], if the signal has a definite frequency band and there is no large noise peak within that band, noise and signal can be separated sufficiently in the [[frequency domain]].

If the signal is either slowly varying or otherwise constant (essentially a DC signal), then [[Flicker noise|1/''f'' noise]] typically overwhelms the signal. It may then be necessary to use external means to modulate the signal. For example, when detecting a small light signal against a bright background, the signal can be modulated either by a [[Optical chopper|chopper wheel]], [[Acousto-optic modulator|acousto-optical modulator]], [[photoelastic modulator]] at a large enough frequency so that 1/''f'' noise drops off significantly, and the lock-in amplifier is referenced to the operating frequency of the modulator. In the case of an [[atomic-force microscope]], to achieve [[nanometer]] and [[piconewton]] resolution, the [[cantilever]] position is modulated at a high frequency, to which the lock-in amplifier is again referenced.

When the lock-in technique is applied, care must be taken to calibrate the signal, because lock-in amplifiers generally detect only the root-mean-square signal of the operating frequency. For a sinusoidal modulation, this would introduce a factor of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; between the lock-in amplifier output and the peak amplitude of the signal, and a different factor for non-sinusoidal modulation.

In the case of nonlinear systems, higher harmonics of the modulation frequency appear. A simple example is the light of a conventional light bulb being modulated at twice the line frequency. Some lock-in amplifiers also allow separate measurements of these higher harmonics.

Furthermore, the response width (effective bandwidth) of detected signal depends on the amplitude of the modulation. Generally, linewidth/modulation function has a monotonically increasing, non-linear behavior.

[[File:BEST-ticket-box.jpg|thumb|A ticket box with tickets waiting to be punched in a [[BEST Bus]] in [[Mumbai]], India.]]
'''Manual fare collection''' is the practice of collecting [[fare]]s manually (without the aid of an [[automated machine]]). "Fare collection" generally refers to the collection of fares in the transport industry in return for a [[ticket (admission)|ticket]] or passes to travel. Commonly used on buses and train transport systems (in the UK; in [[Poland]], for example, buying and validating the tickets by machine is the passenger's task; the passengers enter the bus through any of the doors and buying a ticket from the driver is an option where there is no automatic selling machine or if somebody forgets to buy a ticket before), manual fare collection is increasingly becoming [[obsolete]] with the introduction of [[smart card]]s such as the [[Transport for London]] '[[Oyster card]]'. However, in the face of this trend, some companies have opted to retain more traditional methods of manual fare collection to both save money (automatic equipment is expensive) and ensure reliability. In the [[United Kingdom]], examples of this can be seen on the Transport for London [[Buses in London#Heritage routes|Heritage lines]] and the [[FirstGroup]] [[FTR (bus)|FTR]] routes in [[York]], [[Leeds]], [[Luton]], and [[Swansea]] where bus [[Conductor (transportation)|conductors]] (dubbed 'customer hosts') have returned to work. The other reason(with lowering prices of electronics, and in most cases need to buy it once) may be for Heritage routes - tradition "look", for other routes(because of quite high monthly labor cost in UK) agreements and strong unions with the tries from politics to lower the unemployment rate by making overworking in public service.

==Equipment==
A range of fare collection equipment has been developed over the last century in the United Kingdom.

===Cash bag===
A conductor may carry a cash bag in which cash is kept, thus making it easier while issuing tickets.  
{{See also|money bag}}

===Coin dispenser===
[[File:Schaffnertasche mit galoppwechsler.jpeg|thumb|Coin dispenser]]
Perhaps the biggest development in manual fare collection is the coin dispenser, distributed by Jacques L. Galef. Mounted either in a driver's cab or on the [[belt (clothing)|belt]] of a conductor, the coin dispenser usually takes the form of a number of [[tubing (material)|tubes]] fitted in a line together. Each tube holds a different denomination and tends to have some sort of [[:wikt:trigger|trigger]] which will release the coin from the bottom. In Britain, the Quick-Change and Pendamatic units, for example, has labelled plastic [[funnel]]s at the top, which filter the coins into the tube. A trigger on the front of the machine then releases the coin by pushing a kicker, which holds the coin, forward in a pivotal motion. Other models in Britain, the Cambist and Metro Coin Dispensers, works on a similar principle but also have the option to be attached to the fare collection table allowing the operator (usually the bus driver) to simply slide the coins into the respective tubes. Generally, coin dispensers in the UK are configured with the [[£]]1 coin to the left (as the machine faces you), then the 50[[pence|p]], 20p, 10p, 5p, 2p, 1p. However, some operators have customised their dispensers to better suit their individual needs.

{{See also|money changer}}

===Tender tray===
Other fare collecting equipment includes [[legal tender|tender]] [[tray]]s which can be fitted to bus driver doors to allow the customer to put the fare down. These are common on most buses in the United Kingdom now, since they facilitate quick payment and also allow for the driver to have a screen protecting his cab, yet still securely collect change (the tray is placed with a small gap above it to allow room for the drivers hand to pass through).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1433">'''Muffin rings''' are metal cookware used for oven-baking or griddle-cooking [[muffin]]s or [[English muffin]]s. Muffin rings are circle-shaped objects made of thin metal. The rings are about one inch high. Batter is poured into the rings, which are placed on a griddle. The griddle is then baked in an oven. The muffins and the ring are turned over midway through the baking to bake the other side of the muffin.

==History== 

''Dollar Monthly Magazine'' in 1864 states that muffin rings were used with griddles. First the griddle was heated and greased with pork fat.&lt;ref&gt;''Dollar Monthly Magazine''. Boston: 1864&lt;/ref&gt;An 1861 article states that once the yeast-based dough was prepared, it was molded, allowed to sit for a while, and then placed in buttered muffin rings which were placed on the griddle. &lt;ref&gt;''Godey's Lady's Book and Magazine'' (1861) &lt;/ref&gt; ''Godey's Lady's Book and Magazine'' states that the muffins and rings were turned over with a thin tool resembling a palette knife.&lt;ref&gt;''Godey's Lady's Book and Magazine'' (1861) &lt;/ref&gt; The American author Parloa states that muffin pans, cups or tins should be used rather than muffin rings, since at the time she was writing, muffin rings had faded in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;New Cook Book and Marketing Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1108">A '''naval [[arms race]]''' is when two or more countries continuously construct warships that are consistently more powerful than warships built by the other country built in the previous years. These races often lead to high tension and near-wars, if not outright conflict.

Examples include:
*The [[Austro-Italian ironclad arms race]] between the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] (and later [[Austria-Hungary]]) from 1860 to 1882
*The [[South American dreadnought race]] between [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Chile]] from 1907 to 1914
*The [[Anglo-German naval arms race|World War I naval arms race]] between several powers, including Germany, the United Kingdom and Russia, culminating in [[World War I]]
*The [[World War II]] naval arms race, when Japan, America and Britain, after the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], attempted to gain power in the Pacific.
*The [[Cold War]] [[nuclear arms race]] between the United States and the Soviet Union, which involved both land and naval nuclear expansion.

{{nihongo3|"serve (foods) on the female body"|女体盛り|'''Nyotaimori'''}}, often referred to as '''"body sushi"''', is the Japanese practice of serving [[sashimi]] or [[sushi]] from the naked body of a woman.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bindel|first=Julie|title='I am about to eat sushi off a naked woman's body' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/12/nyotaimori-eating-sushi-naked-woman|publisher=The Guardian|date=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nihongo3||男体盛り|'''Nantaimori'''}} refers to the same practice using a [[male model]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} 

The Japanese practice of ''nyotaimori'' – serving sushi on a naked body – is said to have its origins in the samurai period in Japan.&lt;ref name=Waves&gt;[http://www.insidevancouver.ca/2014/09/06/naked-sushi-makes-waves-in-vancouver/ "Naked Sushi Makes Waves in Vancouver"], ''Inside Vancouver'', 6 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of chef Mike Keenan, "The naked sushi idea began during the samurai period in Japan.

==Procedures==
In traditional ''nyotaimori'', the model is generally expected to lie still at all times and not talk with guests. The sushi is placed on sanitized leaves on the model's body to prevent skin-to-fish contact and on sufficiently flat areas of the body off which the sushi will not roll. ''Nyotaimori'' is considered an art form.&lt;ref name=Waves/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://supervancouver.com/naked-sushi-vancouver/ "Your Fantasy Of Eating Sushi Off A Naked Woman In Vancouver Is Now A Reality"], SuperVancouver&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually champagne and sake are served in naked sushi restaurants. Guests must be respectful and observe the strictest decorum. Talking with the models is highly discouraged. Inappropriate gestures or comments are not tolerated and diners can only pick up sushi with chopsticks, although rules in some restaurants are less strict. For example, in some restaurants guests can nibble nori rolls off nipples if they choose.&lt;ref name=Waves/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2184672/Diners-pay-500-eat-sushi-NUDE-MODELS-Florida-restaurant.html "Naked ambition: Diners pay $500 to eat sushi off NUDE MODELS at Florida restaurant"] ''Daily Mail'', 6 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2014/08/naked-sushi-now-vancouver/ "Naked Sushi Now in Vancouver"], ''VanCity Buzz'', 28 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pastry brush''', also known as a '''basting brush''', is a [[cooking]] utensil used to spread butter, [[oil]] or [[glaze (cooking technique)|glaze]] on food. Traditional pastry [[brushes]] are made with natural [[bristles]] or a [[plastic]] or [[nylon]] fiber similar to a [[paint brush]], while modern kitchen brushes may have [[silicone]] bristles. In [[baking]] [[bread]]s and [[pastry|pastries]], a pastry brush is used to spread a [[glaze (cooking technique)|glaze]] or [[egg wash]] on the crust or surface of the food.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julia Child]] (1996). ''[[Baking with Julia]]'' William Morrow and Company Inc. — {{ISBN|0-688-14657-0}} (USA)&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[roasting]] meats, a pastry brush may be used to sop up juices or drippings from under pan and spread them on the surface of the meat to crisp the [[skin]].

'''Pauline Mary de Peauly Gower Fahie''' (22 July 1910 &amp;ndash; 2 March 1947) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] pilot and writer who established the women's branch of the [[Air Transport Auxiliary]] during the [[Second World War]].

==Early life and education==

Daughter of [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Robert Vaughan Gower|Sir Robert Gower]], and educated at [[Beechwood Sacred Heart School]], she first flew with [[Alan Cobham]] and was fascinated by flying. Gower met [[Dorothy Spicer]] at the London Aeroplane Club at [[Stag Lane Aerodrome]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-67672|title=Spicer [married name Pearse], Dorothy Norman (1908–1946), aviator and aeronautical engineer|last=Fahie|first=Michael|date=2004-09-23|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/67672}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they became friends. In August 1931 they established a joy-riding and air taxi service in Kent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theiet.org/resources/library/archives/research/wes/WES_Vol_3a.html|title="Thirteenth Annual Report".

They hired a plane and later bought a [[De Havilland Gypsy Moth|Gypsy Moth]] for the business, but struggled to make a living so decided to join the [[Crimson Fleet]] air circus and later the British Hospitals' air pageant. 

In 1932, to support British Hospitals, they toured the country with an Air Circus, giving air pageants in 200 towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Women's Engineer (1929 - 1934) |journal=theiet.org|date=|volume=3|url=http://www.theiet.org/resources/library/archives/research/wes/WES_Vol_3a.html|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They joined the Aeronautical Section of the [[Women's Engineering Society]] in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theiet.org/resources/library/archives/research/wes/WES_Vol_3a.html|title="News of Members".

As a writer she was acquainted with [[W. E. Johns]] whose character [[Worrals]] was based on herself as well as [[Amy Johnson]].{{cn|date=February 2016}}

In 1938, she was appointed a civil defence commissioner in [[London]] with the [[Civil Air Guard]]. That year her work on women in aviation&amp;mdash;''Women with Wings''&amp;mdash;was published.&lt;ref&gt;Merry, Lois K.

Gower was appointed as the head of the women's branch, and commenced the selection and testing of women pilots, the first eight being appointed by the ATA on 1 January 1940. Early members included ice-hockey international [[Mona Friedlander]], [[Margaret Fairweather]] ([[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Lord Runciman]]'s daughter) and former ballet dancer [[Rona Rees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airtransportaux.com/firsteight.html|title=ATA First Eight|website=www.airtransportaux.com|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later members included [[Amy Johnson]] and former Olympic skier [[Lois Butler]]. Gower received the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for her services in 1942&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; and received a [[Harmon Trophy]] award posthumously in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://0-find.galegroup.com.catalogue.wellcomelibrary.org/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=wellcome&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=&amp;docId=CS119358564&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=Mrs. W.

The method of building wooden buildings with a traditional [[Timber framing|timber frame]] with horizontal plank or log [[infill]] has many names, the most common of which are '''piece sur piece''' (French. Also used to describe [[log building]]), '''corner post construction''', '''post-and-plank''', '''standerbohlenbau''' (German) and '''skiftesverk''' (Swedish). This traditional building method is believed to be the predecessor to half-timber construction widely known by its German name ''fachwerkbau'' which has wall infill of [[wattle and daub]], brick, or stone. This carpentry was used from parts of Scandinavia to Switzerland to western Russia. Though relatively rare now, two types are found in a number of regions in North America, more common are the walls with planks or timbers which slide in a groove in the posts and less common is a type where horizontal logs are tenoned into individual mortises in the posts. This method is not the same as the [[plank-frame buildings]] in North America with vertical plank walls.

==European history==

"The support of horizontal timbers by corner posts is an old form of construction in Europe. It was apparently carried across much of the continent from Silesia by the Lausitz urnfield culture in the late Bronze Age."&lt;ref&gt;Upton, Dell, and John Michael Vlach. ''Common places: readings in American vernacular architecture''. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1986., referencing V. Gordon Childe, ''The Bronze Age'', (NY, Macmillan, 1930, pp. 206-8)&lt;/ref&gt; The Lausitz culture is also known as the [[Lusatian culture]] and within their territory is an archaeological site and [[archaeological open-air museum]] at [[Biskupin]], Poland, where remnants of such structures were found and reconstructed. The structures found dated from 747–722 B.C and are similar in concept to piece sur piece construction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biskupin.pl&lt;/ref&gt; This historic carpentry is known in southern Sweden (skiftesverk), particularly Gotland where it is also known as ''bulhus'', Germany, Poland, Hungary, Lithuania, Selsia, Switzerland, Austria.

==North American history==
[[File:Golden Plow York PA.JPG|thumb|The 1741 [[Golden Plough Tavern]], York, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. The ground floor is standerblockbau and the upper floor on the front is half timbered (fachwerkbau)]]
Some researchers believe this building method was introduced to the United States by Alpine-Alemannic Germans or Swiss, and to by French fur trappers working for the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. And, &lt;ref&gt;Jordan, Terry, Alpine, "Alemannic, and American Log Architecture", ''Annals, Association of American Geographers'', Vol. 70(1980), pp. 154-80).&lt;/ref&gt; Others, who have studied the development house building in New France believe that the method was developed endemically in Canada as a local adaption of the [[half-timbered]] house, spreading from Québec to the Pacific through the Hudson's Bay Company.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Moogk, ''Building a House in New France'' (Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside, 2002), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hudson's Bay Company adopted this style for most of its outposts all the way to the Pacific coast.&lt;ref&gt;"Corner-Post Log Construction:  Description, Analysis, and Sources", A Report to Early American Industries Association by Nancy S. Shedd March 10, 1986 and updated 2011 {{cite web |url=http://www.huntingdonhistoryresearchnetwork.net/?page_id=236 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925103016/http://www.huntingdonhistoryresearchnetwork.net/?page_id=236 |archivedate=2013-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of surviving houses of this structural type are the circa 1809 [[Cray House (Stevensville, Maryland)|Cray House]] in [[Stevensville, Maryland]], 1832 [[Jacob Highbarger House]] in Maryland, and the [[George Diehl Homestead]].

Red River Frame was a popular name for the post-and-plank construction technique used in the [[Red River Colony]] in the 19th Century.  The building style was characterized by a dressed timber structure with a horizontal log infill.  The spaces between the logs were filled or 'chinked' with clay and straw.  The exterior would either be [[whitewash]]ed with a [[limestone]]/[[water]] plaster mixture, or in later years, the exterior would be covered by board siding.  This style was popular because it could use smaller trees for logs&amp;mdash;the longest trees needed were for the vertical logs.  The Farm Manager's House at [[Lower Fort Garry]], the William Brown House at the Historical Museum of St James&amp;mdash;Assiniboia, the historical Fur Warehouse at Fort St. James National Historic Site of Canada and [[Riel House]] in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]] are excellent examples of Red River Frame construction.
[[File:Brubaker Valley Road.jpg|thumb|Corner post log construction in Lancaster, PA]]
In southeastern Pennsylvania, numerous log houses feature corner post construction.  In many cases, these houses feature diagonal bracing that resembles half-timbered architecture of Europe.  In Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, it is estimated that about a quarter of log houses are corner post construction.

The role of the '''[[Wafer (electronics)|substrate]] in [[power electronics]]''' is to provide the interconnections to form an electric circuit (like a [[printed circuit board]]), and to cool the components. Compared to materials and techniques used in lower power [[microelectronics]], these substrates must carry higher currents and provide a higher voltage isolation (up to several thousand volts). They also must operate over a wide temperature range (up to 150 or 200&amp;nbsp;°C).

==Direct bonded copper substrate==
[[File:DBC.svg|thumb|350px|Structure of a direct bonded copper substrate (top) and an insulated metal substrate (bottom).]]

Direct bonded copper (DBC) substrates are commonly used in [[power module]]s, because of their very good [[thermal conductivity]]. They are composed of a ceramic tile (commonly [[alumina]]) with a sheet of [[copper]] bonded to one or both sides by a high-temperature oxidation process (the copper and substrate are heated to a carefully controlled temperature in an atmosphere of nitrogen containing about 30 ppm of oxygen; under these conditions, a copper-oxygen eutectic forms which bonds successfully both to copper and the oxides used as substrates). The top copper layer can be preformed prior to firing or chemically etched using [[printed circuit board]] technology to form an electrical circuit, while the bottom copper layer is usually kept plain. The substrate is attached to a [[heat spreader]] by soldering the bottom copper layer to it.

Ceramic material used in DBC include:
* [[Alumina]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which is widely used because of its low cost. It is however not a really good thermal conductor (24-28 W/mK) and is brittle.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Liu, Xingsheng (February 2001). "Processing and Reliability Assessment of Solder Joint Interconnection for Power Chips". Virginia Tech Dissertation [http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-04082001-204805/unrestricted/Appendix-A.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aluminium nitride]] (AlN), which is more expensive, but has far better thermal performance (&gt; 150 W/mK).
* [[Beryllium oxide]] (BeO), which has good thermal performance, but is often avoided because of its toxicity when the powder is ingested or inhaled.

One of the main advantages of the DBC substrates is their low [[coefficient of thermal expansion]], which is close to that of [[silicon]] (compared to pure [[copper]]). This ensures good thermal cycling performances (up to 50,000 cycles).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curamik.com/sprache2/n160349/n.html Source: Curamik, manufacturer of DBC]&lt;/ref&gt; The DBC substrates also have excellent electrical insulation and good heat spreading characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Liu, Xingsheng (February 2001). "Processing and Reliability Assessment of Solder Joint Interconnection for Power Chips". Virginia Tech Dissertation [http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-04082001-204805/unrestricted/Appendix-A.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

A related technique uses a seed layer, photoimaging, and then additional copper plating to allow for fine lines (as small as 50 micrometres) and [[through-vias]] to connect front and back sides.  This can be combined with polymer-based circuits to create high density substrates that eliminate the need for direct connection of power devices to heat sinks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hytel.com/film.htm Source: Hytel Group, manufacturer of copper on ceramic substrates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990222160039/http://www.hytel.com/film.htm |date=22 February 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Active metal brazed substrate ==

Another technology to attach thick metal layers to ceramic plates is the AMB (active metal braze) technology. With this process a metal foil is soldered to the ceramic using als{{Clarify|date=June 2016}} solder paste and high temperature (800&amp;nbsp;°C – 1000&amp;nbsp;°C). The process itself requires vacuum. Therefore, though AMB is electrically very similar to DBC, it is only suited for small production lots.

==Insulated metal substrate==

Insulated metal substrate (IMS) consists of a metal baseplate ([[aluminium]] is commonly used because of its low cost and density) covered by a thin layer of [[dielectric]] (usually an epoxy-based layer) and a layer of copper (35&amp;nbsp;µm to more than 200&amp;nbsp;µm thick). The [[FR-4]]-based dielectric is usually thin (about 100 μm) because it has poor thermal conductivity compared to the ceramics used in DBC substrates.

Due to its structure, the IMS is a single-sided substrate, i.e. it can only accommodate components on the copper side. In most applications, the baseplate is attached to a heatsink to provide cooling, usually using [[thermal grease]] and screws. Some IMS substrates are available with a copper baseplate for better thermal performances.

Compared to a classical printed circuit board, the IMS provides a better heat dissipation. It is one of the simplest way to provide efficient cooling to [[Surface mount technology|surface mount components]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bergquistcompany.com/ts_thermal_clad.cfm  Source: The Bergquist company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208112338/http://www.bergquistcompany.com/ts_thermal_clad.cfm |date=8 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other substrates==

* When the power devices are attached to a proper [[heatsink]], there is no need for a thermally efficient substrate. Classical [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) material can be used (this method is typically used with [[through-hole technology]] components). This is also true for low-power applications (from some milliwatts to some watts), as the PCB can be thermally enhanced by using thermal vias or wide tracks to improve [[convection]]. An advantage of this method is that multilayer PCB allows design of complex circuits, whereas DBC and IMS are mostly single-sided technologies.&lt;ref&gt;''Thermal Management in High-Density Power Converters '', Martin März, International Conference on Industrial Technology

* [[Flexible electronics|Flexible substrates]] can be used for low-power applications. As they are built using [[Kapton]] as a dielectric, they can withstand high temperatures and high voltages. Their intrinsic flexibility makes them resistant to [[thermal cycling]] damage.
* Ceramic substrates ([[thick film technology]]) can also be used in some applications (such as automotive) where reliability is of highest importance.&lt;ref&gt;Quick presentation of several applications and features of the thick film substrates [https://web.archive.org/web/20060109065356/http://www.welwyn-tt.co.uk/pdf/brochures/HybridBrochure.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to DCBs, thick film technology offers a higher degree of design freedom but may be less cost-efficient.

The [[Ancient Roman]] [[furniture]], '''''sigma''''' was a semi-circular [[couch]] sometimes used at banquets instead of the ''[[triclinium]]''.&lt;ref name="Romanbanquet"&gt;''The Roman banquet: images of conviviality'', Katherine Dunbabin, 2003, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Its name comes from the [[lunate sigma]] (upper case C, lower case ϲ) — which resembles, but which is not at all related to, the [[Latin alphabet|Latin letter]] [[C]] and was used in Eastern forms of Greek writing and in the Middle Ages.

The '''Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute''' or SWF Institute, or SWFI, is a global corporation analyzing public asset owners such as [[sovereign wealth fund]]s and other long-term governmental investors.  Initially, the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute focused solely on sovereign wealth funds.  It has branched out to cover all types of public institutional investors.  The institute is a [[financial data vendor]] but provides information to the media as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Susanna|title=Why Norwegians Are Millionaires and Americans Are Paupers |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/norwegians-millionaires-norways-sovereign-wealth-fund/story?id=21488085|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blas|first=Javier|title=Protecting Nigeria oil SWF is no easy task |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/69325c28-2440-11e3-a8f7-00144feab7de.html#axzz2qJ6YUFpy|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abedine|first=Saad|title=Body of Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund chief found |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/03/30/uae.body/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Michael Maduell]] and Carl Linaburg in late 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Brad|title=Is there an SWF in your future? |url=http://www.irmagazine.com/articles/shareholder-targeting-id/20204/there-swf-your-future/|publisher=IR Magazine|date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SWFI sells data subscriptions to asset managers, banks, researchers, universities, governments, institutional investors, asset owners, corporations, law firms and other entities.

==Transparency Ratings==
The SWFI came out with the Linaburg-Maduell Transparency Index in 2008.  It is a 10-point scale based on ten principles of transparency, each adding one point to the index rating. The index is used by sovereign wealth funds in their annual reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan ranks among the highest in Transparency Index |url=http://www.oilfund.az/en_US/news/558/100/The-State-Oil-Fund-of-the-Republic-of-Azerbaijan-ranks-among-the-highest-in-Transparency-Index.asp|publisher=SOFAZ|accessdate=11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NSIA Rated Transparent by Sovereign Wealth Institute |url=http://nsia.com.ng/nsia-rated-transparent-sovereign-wealth-institute/|publisher=Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data==
The SWFI tracks direct deals in sovereign wealth funds.  The value of global direct deals by sovereign-wealth funds hit $50.02 billion in the first half of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunkley|first=Dan |title=Sovereign-Wealth Funds Pump Near Record Amount of Cash in Deals |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/08/07/sovereign-wealth-funds-pump-near-record-amount-of-cash-in-deals/|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ulla Mitzdorf''' (March 15, 1944&amp;nbsp;– July 19, 2013) was a German scientist. She contributed to diverse areas including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[psychology]], [[physiology]], [[medicine]] and [[gender studies]].

==Life==
Mitzdorf gained her doctorate in 1974 at the [[Technical University Munich]] in [[theoretical chemistry]]. Subsequently she worked as scholar at the [[Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry|Max-Planck Institute of Psychiatry]] in [[Munich]]. In 1983 she habilitated in physiology, and in 1984 in [[medical psychology]] and [[Neuroscience|neurobiology]] at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]].

From 1988 to 2009 she was Fiebiger Professor for medical psychology at the Ludwig Maximilan University. Simultaneously, she was from 2000 to 2006 women's affairs officer and spokeswoman of the state conference of women and gender equality officers in Bavarian universities.

Mitzdorf died after a short illness on July 19, 2013, aged 69.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7973">A '''video signal generator''' is a type of [[signal generator]] which outputs predetermined [[video]] and/or [[television]] [[Electronic oscillator|oscillation]] waveforms, and other signals used in the [[synchronization]] of television devices and to stimulate faults in, or aid in parametric measurements of, television and video systems. There are several different types of video signal generators in widespread use. Regardless of the specific type, the output of a video generator will generally contain synchronization signals appropriate for television, including horizontal and vertical sync pulses (in analog) or sync words (in digital). Generators of ''composite'' video signals (such as [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]]) will also include a [[colorburst]] signal as part of the output.

== Types of video signal generators ==

Video signal generators are primarily classed according to their function. In addition, they may be classified according to the video formats and interface standard they support—one generator may generate composite analog signals (typically [[NTSC]], [[PAL]], or both), another may generate [[CCIR 601]], and a third may generate [[MPEG]] streams over an [[Asynchronous serial interface|ASI]].

Many manufacturers sell signal generation platforms, which can be populated with multiple modules providing the above capabilities (and supporting different formats). Many such platforms also include audio generation capability (as television includes audio as well as video), supporting either [[embedded audio]] or standalone audio formats.

=== Test signal generators ===

A '''test signal generator''' generates [[test card|test patterns]], and other useful test signals, for troubleshooting and analyzing television systems. These devices are generally intended for off-line use (test patterns are seldom broadcast, unless a station is not operating properly or is off the air at the time), as they output complete television signals. 
Examples of signals output by such a device include:
* [[Color bars]], one of several test signals used to verify the proper reproduction of a TV system's [[color gamut]], and/or that a television signal or plant is compliant with the appropriate analog transmission standards
* '''Flat fields''', a signal consisting of nothing but a specific color (typically white, black, a shade of gray, or one of the [[primary color]]s (red, green, and blue) at maximum saturation). A red field is especially important in [[PAL]] applications, as it is the "red difference" portion of the chroma signal whose phase alternates every line; the red field should appear as a solid block of color, with no visible "bands" going across the screen.
* '''Multibursts''', '''sweeps''', and '''pulse''' signals, used to test the frequency response of a television system
* '''Ramp signals''' and '''staircase signals''', used to check the voltage [[linearity]] of a television system
* '''Crosshatch patterns''', used to check and calibrate alignment, aspect ratio, convergence, and both vertical and horizontal linearity
* The '''bowtie''' signal, used to check the relative (inter-channel) timing of a component video signal.

A few specialized signals are used in [[digital television|digital]] environments:

* The '''PLL test signal''' is a ''pathological'' test signal used to stress the [[phase-locked loop]] of a serial digital receiver; this is done by outputting a bit pattern which, after passing through the [[linear feedback shift register]] used to scramble serial digital signals, resulting (with a high degree of probability) in a long strings of zeroes or ones, followed by a long string of the opposite polarity, on the digital ([[NRZI]]) signal; an issue which can cause poorly designed PLLs to unlock.
* The '''equalizer test signal''' is another pathological signal, consisting of a long string of zeroes or ones, followed by a single bit of the opposite polarity. It can cause poorly designed [[cable equalizer]]s to malfunction.
* The '''SDI Checkfield''' signal, standardized by [[SMPTE]] RP178 (for SD) and RP198 (for HD), is a test signal which contains one of the above signals in the upper portion of the video, and the other in the lower portion of the video.

In addition, sophisticated signal generators may allow modification of the video timing, adjustment of the gains of the various components (including out of range), the introduction of [[jitter]] or [[bit error]]s (into digital signals), the introduction of motion, or other effects.

=== VITS inserters ===

A '''vertical interval test signal inserter''', or '''VITS inserter''' inserts test patterns into the [[vertical interval]] of a television signal. Unlike test signal generators; a VITS inserter is used to insert the test signal into live programming, so that inline measurements of a transmission chain can be made while the chain is operational. (As the vertical interval is typically not visible on end-user televisions, this can be done without producing any artifacts noticeable to viewers). Since VITS signals can often be transmitted, it is also possible for a television station to receive its own on-air feed, and use the VITS to detect and troubleshoot problems in on-air transmission.

=== Sync pulse generators (SPG) ===

A '''sync pulse generator''' is a special type of generator which produces synchronization signals, with a high level of stability and accuracy. These devices are used to provide a master timing source for a video facility. The output of an SPG will typically be in one of several forms, depending on the needs of the facility:
* A [[continuous wave]] signal
* In standard-definition applications, a '''bi-level sync''' signal, often with a [[colorburst]] signal in facilities that have analog equipment. Typically, this is either in [[NTSC]] or [[PAL]] format. As the resulting signal is usually indistinguishable from an all-black television signal of the same format, this sort of reference is commonly known as '''black''' or '''[[Black and burst|black burst]]'''.
* In some high-definition applications, a '[[Tri Level Sync|''tri-level sync'']]' signal is used instead. This signal is virtually identical to the synchronization signal used in [[component video|component analogue video]] (CAV); and is similar to the synchronization signals used in [[VGA]] (the main difference being, in VGA the horizontal and vertical syncs are carried on different wires; whereas TLS signals include both H and V syncs).

=== Logo inserters ===
{{main|Character generator}}

'''Logo inserters''' are devices used to insert a television station's logo, or other fixed graphics, into a live television signal. Often called a "Bug Generator."

'''Well logging''', also known as '''borehole logging''' is the practice of making a detailed record (a ''well log'') of the [[Formation (stratigraphy)|geologic formations]] penetrated by a [[borehole]].  The log may be based either on visual inspection of samples brought to the surface (''geological'' logs) or on physical measurements made by instruments lowered into the hole(''geophysical'' logs).  Some types of geophysical well logs can be done during any phase of a well's history: drilling, completing, producing, or abandoning. Well logging is performed in boreholes drilled for the [[hydrocarbon exploration|oil and gas]], [[groundwater]], [[Mineral exploration|mineral]] and [[Geothermal exploration|geothermal]] exploration, as well as part of environmental and [[geotechnical]] studies.

==Wireline logging==

[[File:Loggrdenres.jpg|thumb|Wireline log consisting of caliper, density and resistivity logs]]
[[File:LI1LOG.jpg|thumb|Wireline log consisting of a complete set of logs]]
The [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[Natural Gas|gas]] industry uses [[Wireline (cabling)|wireline]] logging to obtain a continuous record of a formation's [[petrophysics|rock properties]].  Wireline logging can be defined as being "The acquisition and analysis of geophysical data performed as a function of well bore depth, together with the provision of related services." Note that "wireline logging" and "mud logging" are not the same, yet are closely linked through the integration of the data sets. The measurements are made referenced to "TAH" - True Along Hole depth: these and the associated analysis can then be used to infer further properties, such as [[water content|hydrocarbon saturation]] and [[well control|formation pressure]], and to make further [[Drilling engineering|drilling]] and [[hydrocarbon exploration|production]] decisions.

Wireline logging is performed by lowering a 'logging tool' - or a string of one or more instruments - on the end of a wireline into an [[oil well]] (or borehole) and recording petrophysical properties using a variety of sensors.  Logging tools developed over the years measure the natural gamma ray, electrical, acoustic, stimulated radioactive responses, electromagnetic, nuclear magnetic resonance, pressure and other properties of the rocks and their contained fluids.  For this article, they are broadly broken down by the main property that they respond to.

The data itself is recorded either at surface (real-time mode), or in the hole (memory mode) to an electronic data format and then either a printed record or electronic presentation called a "well log" is provided to the client, along with an electronic copy of the raw data.  Well logging operations can either be performed during the drilling process (see Logging While Drilling), to provide real-time information about the formations being penetrated by the borehole, or once the well has reached Total Depth and the whole depth of the borehole can be logged.

Real-time data is recorded directly against measured cable depth.  Memory data is recorded against time, and then depth data is simultaneously measured against time.  The two data sets are then merged using the common time base to create an instrument response versus depth log.  Memory recorded depth can also be corrected in exactly the same way as real-time corrections are made, so there should be no difference in the attainable TAH accuracy.

The measured cable depth can be derived from a number of different measurements, but is usually either recorded based on a calibrated wheel counter, or (more accurately) using magnetic marks which provide calibrated increments of cable length.  The measurements made must then be corrected for elastic stretch and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Bolt, Wireline Depth Determination, Rev 3.3, Apr 2012, available via Society of Professional Well Log Analysts web site, www.spwla.org&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many types of wireline logs and they can be categorized either by their function or by the technology that they use. "Open hole logs" are run before the oil or gas well is lined with pipe or cased. "Cased hole logs" are run after the well is lined with casing or production pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Wireline logs can be divided into broad categories based on the physical properties measured.

===History===
[[Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger]], who founded [[Schlumberger|Schlumberger Limited]] in 1926, are considered the inventors of electric well logging.  Conrad developed the [[Schlumberger array]], which was a technique for prospecting for [[metal]] [[ore]] deposits, and the brothers adapted that surface technique to subsurface applications.  On September 5, 1927, a crew working for Schlumberger lowered an electric sonde or tool down a well in Pechelbronn, Alsace, France creating the first [[well log]].  In modern terms, the first log was a [[resistivity log]] that could be described as 3.5-meter upside-down lateral log.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1931, [[Henri George Doll]] and G. Dechatre, working for Schlumberger, discovered that the [[galvanometer]] wiggled even when no current was being passed through the logging cables down in  the well.  This led to the discovery of the [[spontaneous potential]] (SP) which was as important as the ability to measure [[resistivity]].  The SP effect was produced naturally by the borehole [[mud]] at the boundaries of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeable]] beds.  By simultaneously recording SP and resistivity, loggers could distinguish between permeable oil-bearing beds and impermeable nonproducing beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pike |first=Bill |authorlink= |author2=Rhonda Duey |title=Logging history rich with innovation |journal=Hart's E&amp;P |volume= |issue= |pages=52–55 |publisher= |location= |year=2002 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7442038_ITM |doi= |id= |accessdate=2008-06-02 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3APike+intitle%3ALogging+history+rich+with+innovation&amp;as_publication=Hart%27s+E%26P&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Schlumberger invented the [[spontaneous potential]] [[dipmeter]]; this instrument allowed the calculation of the [[strike and dip|dip]] and direction of the dip of a layer.  The basic dipmeter was later enhanced by the resistivity dipmeter (1947) and the continuous resistivity dipmeter (1952).

Oil-based mud (OBM) was first used in Rangely Field, Colorado in 1948.  Normal electric logs require a conductive or water-based mud, but OBMs are nonconductive.  The solution to this problem was the induction log, developed in the late 1940s.

The introduction of the [[transistor]] and [[integrated circuits]] in the 1960s made electric logs vastly more reliable.  Computerization allowed much faster log processing, and dramatically expanded log data-gathering capacity.  The 1970s brought more logs and computers.  These included combo type logs where [[resistivity logs]] and porosity logs were recorded in one pass in the borehole.

The two types of porosity logs (acoustic logs and nuclear logs) date originally from the 1940s.  [[Sonic logs]] grew out of technology developed during World War II.  Nuclear logging has supplemented acoustic logging, but acoustic or sonic logs are still run on some combination logging tools.

Nuclear logging was initially developed to measure the natural gamma radiation emitted by underground formations.   However, the industry quickly moved to logs that actively bombard rocks with [[nuclear particles]].  The [[gamma ray]] log, measuring the natural radioactivity, was introduced by Well Surveys Inc. in 1939, and the WSI [[neutron]] log came in 1941. The gamma ray log is particularly useful as shale beds which often provide a relatively low permeability cap over hydrocarbon reservoirs usually display a higher level of gamma radiation. These logs were important because they can be used in cased wells (wells with production casing).  WSI quickly became part of Lane-Wells.  During [[World War II]], the US Government gave a near wartime monopoly on open-hole logging to [[Schlumberger]], and a monopoly on cased-hole logging to [[Lane-Wells]].&lt;ref&gt;Now a division of Baker Hughes&lt;/ref&gt;  Nuclear logs continued to evolve after the war.

After the discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance by Bloch and Purcell in 1946, the [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] log using the Earth's field was developed in the early 1950s by Chevron and Schlumberger.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  The NMR log was a scientific success but an engineering failure. More recent engineering developments by NUMAR (a subsidiary of [[Halliburton]]) in the 1990s has resulted in continuous NMR logging technology which is now applied in the oil and gas, water and metal exploration industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kleinberg|first1=Robert L.|last2=Jackson|first2=Jasper A.|title=An introduction to the history of NMR well logging|journal=Concepts in Magnetic Resonance|date=2001|volume=13|issue=6|pages=340–342|doi=10.1002/cmr.1018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Many modern oil and gas wells are drilled directionally.  At first, loggers had to run their tools somehow attached to the drill pipe if the well was not vertical.  Modern techniques now permit continuous information at the surface.  This is known as [[logging while drilling]] (LWD) or [[measurement-while-drilling]] (MWD).  MWD logs use [[mud pulse technology]] to transmit data from the tools on the bottom of the [[Drill string|drillstring]] to the processors at the surface.

===Electrical logs===

====Resistivity log====
{{See also|Resistivity logging}}
Resistivity logging measures the subsurface electrical resistivity, which is the ability to impede the flow of electric current. This helps to differentiate between formations filled with salty waters (good conductors of electricity) and those filled with hydrocarbons (poor conductors of electricity). Resistivity and porosity measurements are used to calculate water saturation. Resistivity is expressed in ohms or ohms/meter, and is frequently charted on a logarithm scale versus depth because of the large range of resistivity. The distance from the borehole penetrated by the current varies with the tool, from a few centimeters to one meter.

====[[Borehole Image Logs|Borehole Imaging]]====
{{Main|Borehole Image Logs}}

The term "borehole imaging" refers to those logging and data-processing methods that are used to produce centimeter-scale images of the borehole wall and the rocks that make it up. The context is, therefore, that of open hole, but some of the tools are closely related to their cased-hole equivalents. Borehole imaging has been one of the most rapidly advancing technologies in wireline well logging. The applications range from detailed reservoir description through reservoir performance to enhanced hydrocarbon recovery. Specific applications are fracture identification, analysis of small-scale sedimentological features, evaluation of net pay in thinly bedded formations, and the identification of breakouts (irregularities in the borehole wall that are aligned with the minimum horizontal stress and appear where stresses around the wellbore exceed the compressive strength of the rock).&lt;ref&gt;http://petrowiki.org/Borehole_imaging&lt;/ref&gt;
The subject area can be classified into four parts:
# 1. Optical imaging
# 2. Acoustic imaging
# 3. Electrical imaging
# 4. Methods that draw on both acoustic and electrical imaging techniques using the same logging tool

===Porosity logs===
[[Porosity]] logs measure the fraction or percentage of pore volume in a volume of rock. Most porosity logs use either [[acoustics|acoustic]] or [[Nuclear physics|nuclear]] technology.  Acoustic logs measure characteristics of sound waves propagated through the well-bore environment. Nuclear logs utilize nuclear reactions that take place in the downhole logging instrument or in the formation. Nuclear logs include density logs and neutron logs, as well as gamma ray logs which are used for correlation.

  | page = 168 p. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle behind the use of nuclear technology is that a neutron source placed near the formation whose porosity is being measured will result in neutrons being scattered by the hydrogen atoms, largely those present in the formation fluid. Since there is little difference in the neutrons scattered by hydrocarbons or water, the porosity measured gives a figure close to the true physical porosity whereas the figure obtained from electrical resistivity measurements is that due to the conductive formation fluid. The difference between neutron porosity and electrical porosity measurements therefore indicates the presence of hydrocarbons in the formation fluid.

====Density====
{{See also|Density logging}}
The density log measures the [[bulk density]] of a formation by bombarding it with a radioactive source and measuring the resulting gamma ray count after the effects of [[Compton Scattering]] and [[Photoelectric effect|Photoelectric absorption]].  This bulk density can then be used to determine porosity.

====Neutron porosity====
{{See also|Formation evaluation neutron porosity}}
The neutron porosity log works by bombarding a formation with high energy [[Neutron temperature|epithermal neutrons]] that lose energy through [[elastic scattering]] to near thermal levels before being absorbed by the [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of the formation atoms.  Depending on the particular type of neutron logging tool, either the [[gamma ray]] of capture, scattered thermal neutrons or scattered, higher energy epithermal neutrons are detected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=epithermal%20neutron%20porosity%20measurement Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;  The neutron porosity log is predominantly sensitive to the quantity of [[hydrogen atom]]s in a particular formation, which generally corresponds to rock porosity.

[[Boron]] is known to cause anomalously low neutron tool count rates due to it having a high capture cross section for thermal neutron absorption.&lt;ref&gt;

  | page = 249 p. }}&lt;/ref&gt;   An increase in hydrogen concentration in clay minerals has a similar effect on the count rate.

====Sonic====
{{See also|Sonic logging}}
A sonic log provides a formation interval transit time, which typically a function of lithology and rock texture but particularly porosity.  The logging tool consists of a piezoelectric transmitter and receiver and the time taken to for the sound wave to travel the fixed distance between the two is recorded as an ''interval transit time''.

===Lithology logs===

====Gamma ray====
{{See also|Gamma ray logging}}
A log of the natural radioactivity of the formation along the borehole, measured in [[American Petroleum Institute#Standards and certification|API units]], particularly useful for distinguishing between sands and shales in a siliclastic environment.&lt;ref name="darling"&gt;

  | page = 5 p. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because sandstones are usually nonradioactive quartz, whereas shales are naturally radioactive due to potassium isotopes in clays, and adsorbed uranium and thorium.

In some rocks, and in particular in carbonate rocks, the contribution from uranium can be large and erratic, and can cause the carbonate to be mistaken for a shale. In this case, The carbonate gamma ray is a better indicator of shaliness. the carbonate gamma ray log is a gamma ray log from which the uranium contribution has been subtracted.

====Self/spontaneous potential====
{{See also|Spontaneous potential logging}}
The Spontaneous Potential (SP) log measures the natural or [[Spontaneous potential|spontaneous potential difference]] between the borehole and the surface, without any applied current.  It was one of the first wireline logs to be developed, found when a single potential [[electrode]] was lowered into a well and a potential was measured relative to a fixed reference electrode at the surface.&lt;ref name="Etnyre"&gt;

The most useful component of this potential difference is the [[electrochemical potential]] because it can cause a significant deflection in the SP response opposite permeable beds.  The magnitude of this deflection depends mainly on the [[salinity]] contrast between the drilling mud and the formation water, and the clay content of the permeable bed.  Therefore, the SP log is commonly used to detect permeable beds and to estimate clay content and formation water salinity.
The SP log can be used to distinguish between impermeable shale and permeable shale and  porous sands.

===Miscellaneous===

====Caliper====
{{See also|Caliper log}}
A tool that measures the diameter of the borehole, using either 2 or 4 arms.&lt;ref name="darling" /&gt;  It can be used to detect regions where the borehole walls are compromised and the well logs may be less reliable.

====Nuclear magnetic resonance====
{{See also|Nuclear magnetic resonance logging}}
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging uses the [[nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR response]] of a [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] to directly determine its [[porosity]] and [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]], providing a continuous record along the length of the [[borehole]].&lt;ref&gt;Gluyas, J. &amp; Swarbrick, R. (2004) Petroleum Geoscience. Publ. Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleinberg"&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging – Technology of the 21st century.  Kenyon, Kleinberg, Straley, Gubelin, and Morris. Oilfield Review. http://eps.mcgill.ca/~courses/c550/Literature/NMR-21st-century.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The chief application of the NMR tool is to determine moveable fluid volume (BVM) of a rock. This is the pore space excluding clay bound water (CBW) and irreducible water (BVI). Neither of these are moveable in the NMR sense, so these volumes are not easily observed on older logs. On modern tools, both CBW and BVI can often be seen in the signal response after transforming the relaxation curve to the porosity domain. Note that some of the moveable fluids (BVM) in the NMR sense are not actually moveable in the oilfield sense of the word. Residual oil and gas, heavy oil, and bitumen may appear moveable to the NMR precession measurement, but these will not necessarily flow into a well bore.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.spec2000.net/07-nmrlog.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spectral noise logging====
'''Spectral noise logging (SNL)''' is an [[acoustic noise]] measuring technique used in [[oil well|oil]] and [[gas well]]s for well integrity analysis, identification of production and injection intervals and hydrodynamic characterisation of the reservoir. SNL records acoustic noise generated by fluid or gas flow through the reservoir or leaks in downhole well components.

Noise logging tools have been used in the [[petroleum industry]] for several decades. As far back as 1955, an acoustic detector was proposed for use in well integrity analysis to identify casing holes.&lt;ref&gt;Enright, R.J. 1955. Sleuth for Down-Hole Leaks, Oil &amp; Gas J.:78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Logging while drilling ===

In the 1970s, a new approach to wireline logging was introduced in the form of [[Logging While Drilling|logging while drilling (LWD)]].  This technique provides similar well information to conventional wireline logging but instead of sensors being lowered into the well at the end of wireline cable, the sensors are integrated into the [[drill string]] and the measurements are made in real-time, whilst the well is being drilled.  This allows drilling engineers and geologists to quickly obtain information such as porosity, resistivity, hole direction and weight-on-bit and they can use this information to make immediate decisions about the future of the well and the direction of drilling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?insight_id=297&amp;c_id=1 Rigzone How Does Logging-While-Drilling (LWD) Work?]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In LWD, measured data is transmitted to the surface in real time via pressure pulses in the well's mud fluid column.  This mud telemetry method provides a bandwidth of less than 10 bits per second, although, as drilling through rock is a fairly slow process, data compression techniques mean that this is an ample bandwidth for real-time delivery of information.  A higher sample rate of data is recorded into memory and retrieved when the drillstring is withdrawn at bit changes.  High-definition downhole and subsurface information is available through [[IntelliServ#Technology|networked or wired drillpipe]] that deliver memory quality data in real time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ali|first=T.H. |author2=M. Sas |author3=J.H. Hood |author4=S.R. Lemke |author5=A. Srinivasan|title=High Speed Telemetry Drill Pipe Network Optimizes Drilling Dynamics And Wellbore Placement|journal=Society of Petroleum Engineers|year=2008|url=http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/app/Preview.do?paperNumber=SPE-112636-MS&amp;societyCode=SPE|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corrosion well logging===
Throughout the life of the wells, integrity controles of the steel and cemented column (casing and tubing) are performed using calipers and thickness gauges. These advanced technical methods use non destructive technologies as ultrasonic, electromagnetic and magnetic transducers.&lt;ref&gt;Stéphane Sainson, ''Les diagraphies de corrosion''. Ed. Lavoisier, 548 p., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memory log===
This method of data acquisition involves recording the sensor data into a down hole memory, rather than transmitting "Real Time" to surface. There are some advantages and disadvantages to this memory option.
*The tools can be conveyed into wells where the trajectory is deviated or extended beyond the reach of conventional Electric Wireline cables. This can involve a combination of weight to strength ratio of the electric cable over this extended reach. In such cases the memory tools can be conveyed on Pipe or Coil Tubing.
*The type of sensors are limited in comparison to those used on Electric Line, and tend to be focussed on the cased hole,production stage of the well. Although there are now developed some memory "Open Hole" compact formation evaluation tool combinations.  These tools can be deployed and carried downhole concealed internally in drill pipe to protect them from damage while running in the hole, and then "Pumped" out the end at depth to initiate logging. Other basic open hole formation evaluation memory tools are available for use in "Commodity" markets on slickline to reduce costs and operating time.
*In cased hole operation there is normally a "Slick Line" intervention unit. This uses a solid mechanical wire (0.072 - 0.125&amp;nbsp;inches in OD), to manipulate or otherwise carry out operations in the well bore completion system. Memory operations are often carried out on this Slickline conveyance in preference to mobilizing a full service Electric Wireline unit.
*Since the results are not known until returned to surface, any realtime well dynamic changes cannot be monitored real time. This limits the ability to modify or change the well down hole production conditions accurately during the memory logging by changing the surface production rates. Something that is often done in Electric Line operations.
*Failure during recording is not known until the memory tools are retrieved. This loss of data can be a major issue on large offshore (expensive) locations. On land locations (e.g. South Texas, US) where there is what is called a "Commodity" Oil service sector, where logging often is without the rig infrastructure. this is less problematic, and logs are often run again without issue.

==Coring==
{{See also|Core sample}}
[[File:Rochovce granite01.JPG|thumb|An example of a granite core]]
Coring is the process of obtaining an actual sample of a rock formation from the borehole.  There are two main types of coring: 'full coring', in which a sample of rock is obtained using a specialised drill-bit as the borehole is first penetrating the formation and 'sidewall coring', in which multiple samples are obtained from the side of the borehole after it has penetrated through a formation.  The main advantage of sidewall coring over full coring are that it is cheaper (drilling doesn't have to be stopped) and multiple samples can be easily acquired, with the main disadvantages being that there can be uncertainty in the depth at which the sample was acquired and the tool can fail to acquire the sample.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halliburton.com/ps/default.aspx?navid=1831&amp;pageid=1141&amp;prodgrpid=PRG%3a%3aJCFUH1E8Z Halliburton.

==Mudlogging==
{{See also|Mud logging}}
''[[Mud log]]s'' are well logs prepared by describing rock or soil cuttings brought to the surface by mud circulating in the borehole. In the oil industry they are usually prepared by a [[mud logging]] company contracted by the operating company. One parameter a typical mud log displays is the formation gas (gas units or ppm).  "The gas recorder usually is scaled in terms of arbitrary gas units, which are defined differently by the various gas-detector manufactures. In practice, significance is placed only on relative changes in the gas concentrations detected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Other information that is normally notated on a [[mud log]] include directional data ([[deviation surveys]]), [[weight on bit]], [[rotary table (drilling rig)|rotary speed]], [[pump pressure]], [[pump rate]], [[viscosity]], drill bit info, casing shoe depths, formation tops, mud pump info, to name just a few.

==Information use==
{{See also|Formation evaluation}}
In the oil industry, the well and mud logs are usually transferred in 'real time' to the operating company, which uses these logs to make operational decisions about the well, to correlate formation depths with surrounding wells, and to make interpretations about the quantity and quality of hydrocarbons present. Specialists involved in well log interpretation are called log analysts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13243">During [[World War II]], the German [[Army]] relied on an diverse array of communications to maintain contact with its mobile forces and in particular with its armoured forces. Most of this equipment received the generic prefix FuG for '''''Funkgerät''''', meaning "radio device". Occasionally the shorted Fu designation were used and there were exceptions to both these systems. Number ranges were not unique across the services so sometimes different equipment used by different services had the same FuG prefix. This article is a list and a description of the radio equipment.

==Armoured force communications==
'''FuG 2''': A high-band [[High frequency|HF]]/low-band [[VHF]] receiver. It operated in the 27,000 to 33,3000 &amp;nbsp;kHz (27-33.3&amp;nbsp;MHz) range. The FuG 2 was never used on its own but as an additional receiver in command tanks and relay devices. It was usually installed in Section leader and company commanders vehicles, to allow then to listen on one frequency while transmitting and receiving on another. As it operated on the same band as the FuG 5 it allowed them, for example,to listen to the regimental command net while talking to the subbornate units at the same time.  Matching the transmitters that operated in this frequency range, this receiver provided for 50 kHz channel steps in the 27.0 to 33.3 MHz range for a total of 125 available channels.  

'''FuG 4''': A medium wave receiver used in command tanks. It operated in the 1,130 to 3,000 &amp;nbsp;kHz frequency range. It was used with the same antenna as the Fug 8. It was usually used for communication  with a Fug 8 in the same installation. (Fug 8 + Fug 4)

'''FuG 5''': A high-band HF/low-band VHF transceiver. It operated in the 27,000 to 33,3000 &amp;nbsp;kHz (27-33.3&amp;nbsp;MHz) frequency range with a transmit power of 10 Watts.  This equipment provided for 125 radio channels at 50 kHz channel spacing.   It was usually used with a 2-metre antenna. Was present in almost all German tanks and some other vehicles. Was the standard kit for tank-to-tank communication within platoons and companies. Range was approx 2–3&amp;nbsp;km when using AM voice and 3–4&amp;nbsp;km when using CW.  

'''FuG 6''': A high-band HF/low-band VHF transceiver. It operated in the 27,000 to 33,3000 &amp;nbsp;kHz (27-33.3&amp;nbsp;MHz) frequency range with a transmit power of 20 Watts. It was usually used with a 2-metre antenna. It was used by armoured observation posts. These were usually early model tanks with some of their armament removed and replaced by equipment for artillery observers. It was used by the observers to communicate with the armoured unit leaders via their Fug 5 radios. Main advantage over the FuG 5 was greater range. Range was approx 4–6&amp;nbsp;km when using AM voice and 6–8&amp;nbsp;km when using CW.  Comparable with the American [[SCR-508]] tank radio, which covered a similar frequency range (20-27.9&amp;nbsp;MHz) at 25 watts. The major difference between German Army tank sets and US Army tank sets was the American use of FM for the high-HF/low-VHF bands.

'''FuG 7''': A VHF transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in command tanks. It operated in the 42,000 to 48,3000 &amp;nbsp;kHz (42-48.3&amp;nbsp;MHz) frequency range with a transmit power of 20 Watts. It was usually used with a 1.4 metre antenna. It was matched with  the Luftwaffe transceiver [[Luftwaffe radio equipment (Funkgerät) of World War II|Fug 17]] in ground support operations. It was used for [[Close Air Support|CAS]] operations, though these became rare after late 1944 with the result that many command tanks with this equipment fitted were converted to other roles. Range 60&amp;nbsp;km AM voice to 80&amp;nbsp;km CW.

'''FuG 8''': A medium wave transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in command tanks. It operated in the 1,130 to 3,000 &amp;nbsp;kHz frequency range with a transmit power of 30 Watts. It was used with various antenna ranging from  1.8 to 9 metres antenna. It was used for communication back to the regimental command post. Range 25&amp;nbsp;km AM voice to 140&amp;nbsp;km CW using the 9 m antenna, the station had to be stopped to use this antenna.

'''FuG 10''': A medium wave transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in command tanks. It operated in the 1,130 to 3,000 &amp;nbsp;kHz frequency range with a transmit power of 30 Watts. It was used with a frame antenna on various reconnance units.  Range 10&amp;nbsp;km AM voice to 40&amp;nbsp;km CW.

'''FuG 11''': A medium wave transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in command tanks. It operated in the 1,130 to 3,000 &amp;nbsp;kHz frequency range with a transmit power of 100 Watts. Used at the regimental command post. Range 70&amp;nbsp;km AM voice to 200&amp;nbsp;km CW.

'''FuG 12''': A medium wave transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in command tanks. It operated in the 1,130 to 3,000 &amp;nbsp;kHz frequency range with a transmit power of 80 Watts. It was used with a 2-metre antenna. reconnaissance units later in the war.

'''FuG 13''': A Fug 6 with two receivers rather than 1.

'''FuG 15''': A HF receiver. It operated in the 23,000 to 24,950,3000 &amp;nbsp;kHz (23-24.95&amp;nbsp;MHz) frequency range. It was matched with transceiver Fug 16 for use with Sturmartillerie (self-propelled artillery).

'''FuG 16''': A HF transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in the command vehicles of Sturmartillerie units. It operated in the 23,000 to 24,950 &amp;nbsp;kHz (23-24.95&amp;nbsp;MHz) frequency range with a transmit power of 10 Watts. It was usually used with a 2.0 metre antenna. Range 2&amp;nbsp;km AM voice to 4&amp;nbsp;km CW.

'''FuSpr.a''': A mid-band HF transceiver. It operated in the 24.1 to 25 &amp;nbsp;MHz (24100 to 25000 &amp;nbsp;kHz) frequency range with a transmit power of 5 Watts. It was used with antenna of either 1.4 to 2.0 metres antenna. It was used for by reconnaissance elements for intercommunication . Range 5&amp;nbsp;km AM voice.&lt;ref name = TME451&gt;http://www.nonstopsystems.com/radio/pdf-hell/article-hdbk-TM-E-30-451.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FuSpr.f''': A mid-band HF transceiver. It operated in the 19,990 to 21,470 &amp;nbsp;kHz (19.99-21.47&amp;nbsp;MHz) frequency range with a transmit power of 5 Watts. It was used with antenna of either 1.4 to 2.0 metres antenna. It was used for by reconnaissance elements of the SPG force to communicate with artillery units. Range 5&amp;nbsp;km AM voice.&lt;ref name = TME451 /&gt;

== UHF Communication Link Equipment ==

From 1936 the German forces started deploying a range of communication links using UHF frequencies to form a point-to-point mesh communication network.
During the war this was extended to cover the majority of the occupied areas or Europe and North Africa. Both the Army and the Air force made use of the same equipment. The units of the T series were "backpack" style mobile equipment. The K series were truck mobile units using a range of masts up to approximately 11 m tall. The G series were still mobile but were intended to form more of a backbone for communications and were intended to remain in place for longer periods than the K. They again used a series of masts up to 50 m high. Depending on the set a range of communication facilities were available consisting of voice and/or teletype and Hellscriber. Range was line-or-sight so the ranges reported here were assuming the antenna could "see" one another.&lt;ref name = SIGESO&gt;http://www.cdvandt.org/SIGESO-DMG-RF-FH-Allemands.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/s/ht7s2xjb8vovnbn/article-German-Communication-UHF-DMGmichael.pdf?dl=0 German UHF Communication Systems&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ZEEP''' (Zero Energy Experimental Pile) reactor was a [[nuclear reactor]] built at the [[Chalk River Laboratories]] near [[Chalk River]], [[Ontario]], Canada (which superseded the [[Montreal Laboratory]] for nuclear research in Canada).  ZEEP first went critical at 15:45 on September 5, 1945.  ZEEP's was the first operational nuclear reactor outside the United States.&lt;ref name="zeep-cstm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/whatson/zeep.cfm |title=ZEEP -- Canada's First Nuclear Reactor |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306233719/http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/whatson/zeep.cfm |archivedate=6 March 2014 |publisher=Canada Science and Technology Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reactor was designed by Canadian, British and French scientists as a part of an effort to produce [[plutonium]] for [[nuclear weapons]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Canada's Historical Role"&gt;[http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/resources/fact-sheets/Canadas-contribution-to-nuclear-weapons-development.cfm "Canada's Historical Role in Developing Nuclear Weapons"], Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was developed while the [[Montreal Laboratory]] and [[Chalk River Laboratories]] research facility were under the supervision of the [[National Research Council of Canada]] (NRC).  ZEEP was instrumental in the development of the [[NRX]] and [[National Research Universal Reactor|NRU]] reactors, which led to the development of the successful [[CANDU reactor]].&lt;ref name="zeep-cstm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/history-of-engineering/ "History of Engineering"], The Canadian Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/candu/candu_achievement.html "Canada's Nuclear Achievement: Technical and Economic Perspectives"], IEEE Canada&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://weconnect.uwaterloo.ca/marvels-achievements.html "Canadian Engineering Achievements"], University of Waterloo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/science-technology/energy-production/candu-the-canadian-nuclear-reactor/topic---candu-the-canadian-nuclear-reactor.html "Candu: The Canadian Nuclear Reactor"], CBC Digital Archives&lt;/ref&gt;  ZEEP was used to test reactivity effects and other [[physics]] parameters needed for reactor development at Chalk River Laboratories, including fuel lattices for the NRU reactor situated next door.

ZEEP was one of the world's first [[heavy water reactor]]s, and it was also designed to use natural (unenriched) [[uranium]]; a feature carried through to the CANDU design. [[Uranium enrichment]] is a complex and expensive process; thus, the ability to use unenriched uranium gave ZEEP and its descendants a number of distinct advantages.

ZEEP continued to be used for basic research until 1970.&lt;ref name="zeep-cstm" /&gt;  It was decommissioned in 1973 and dismantled in 1997. In 1966 ZEEP was designated a historic site by Ontario, and commemorated with an [http://dr-dn.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/view/object/?id=8b33b505-6b03-4a25-9156-622eca7529dd historic plaque].  Both this plaque and ZEEP itself are now on display at the [[Canada Science and Technology Museum]] in [[Ottawa]], Canada.
