[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|Storming of the Bastille, July 14, 1789, an iconic event of the [[French Revolution]]]] 
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|Development of the [[Watt steam engine]] in the late 18th century was an important element in the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Great Britain.]]
[[File:Canadian_militiamen_and_British_soldiers_repulse_the_American_assault_at_Sault-au-Matelot.jpg|thumb|The [[American Revolutionary War]] took place in the late 18th century.]] 
The '''18th century''' lasted from January 1, [[1701]] to December 31, [[1800]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. During the 18th century, the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] culminated in the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French revolution]]s. Philosophy and science increased in prominence. Philosophers dreamed of a brighter age. This dream turned into a reality with the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, though later compromised by the excesses of the [[Reign of Terror]] (1793–1794) under [[Maximilien Robespierre]]. At first, many monarchies of Europe embraced Enlightenment ideals, but with the French Revolution they feared losing their power and formed broad coalitions for the [[counter-revolution]]. The [[Ottoman Empire]] experienced an unprecedented period of peace and economic expansion, taking part in no European wars from 1740 to 1768. As a consequence the empire did not share in Europe's military improvements during the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763), causing its military to fall behind and suffer defeats against [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in the second half of the century. 

18th century music included the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]] (including [[Johan Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frederic Handel]]) and the [[Classical period (music)|classical period]] (including [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]).

The 18th century also marked the end of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] as an independent state. The once-powerful and vast kingdom, which had once conquered Moscow and defeated great Ottoman armies, collapsed under numerous invasions. Its semi-democratic government system was not robust enough to rival the neighboring monarchies of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Empire]] which divided the Commonwealth territories between themselves, changing the landscape of [[Central Europe]]an politics for the next hundred years.

[[European colonization of the Americas]] and other parts of the world intensified and associated mass migrations of people grew in size as the [[Age of Sail]] continued. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] became a major power worldwide with the [[French and Indian War|defeat of France in North America]] in the 1760s and [[Company rule in India|the conquest of large parts of India]]. However, Britain lost many of its North American colonies after the [[American Revolution]], which resulted in the formation of the newly independent United States. The [[Industrial Revolution]] started in Britain in the 1770s with the production of the improved [[steam engine]]. Despite its modest beginnings in the 18th century, steam-powered machinery would radically change human society and the environment.

Western historians have occasionally defined the 18th century otherwise for the purposes of their work. For example, the "short" 18th century may be defined as 1715–1789, denoting the period of time between the death of [[Louis XIV of France]] and the start of the French Revolution, with an emphasis on directly interconnected events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Anderson, M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1612">'''ABMAP''', also known as the '''Animal Bone Metrical Archive Project''', consists of a collection of metric data on the main domestic animals recorded at the [[University of Southampton]], together with the data from some other sources, in particular the [[Museum of London Archaeology Service]] (MoLAS). Whilst the data is primarily from [[England]], it is applicable to a wider geographical area. Stored in a neutral archival format, it is freely available for teaching, learning and research.

== History of the Project ==

In the 1990s [[English Heritage]] funded a project at the University of Southampton to collect and synthesize metrical data recorded over the past twenty years. The main aim was to assemble the data and ensure that it was kept in a format in which it would be maintained and made accessible.

== The Database ==

The project aimed to collect measurements of the main domestic species found on archaeological sites in England. The database included approximately 25,000 bones, predominantly of [[cattle]] and [[sheep]], but also of [[pig]], [[horse]], [[dog]], [[goat]], [[domestic fowl]], and [[goose]]. The [[data set]] is organized by [[species]], [[anatomical element]], [[Historical period|period]], and [[Archaeological site|site]] type.

[[File:AthensAcropolisDawnAdj06028.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|The [[Acropolis of Athens]]]]

An '''acropolis''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: ἀκρόπολις, ''akropolis''; from ''akros'' (άκρος) or ''akron'' (άκρον), "highest, topmost, outermost" and ''polis'' (πόλις), "city"; plural in English: ''acropoles'', ''acropoleis'' or ''acropolises'')&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|acropolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)kro/polis|acropolis}}, {{LSJ|a)/kros|akros}},  {{LSJ|a)/kron|akron|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was in [[ancient Greece]] a [[Human settlement|settlement]], especially a [[citadel]], built upon an area of elevated ground&amp;mdash;frequently a hill with [[precipice|precipitous]] sides, chosen for purposes of defense.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/acropolis&lt;/ref&gt; Acropoleis became the nuclei of large cities of [[classical antiquity]], such as [[ancient Athens]], and for this reason they are sometimes prominent landmarks in modern cities with ancient pasts, such as modern [[Athens]].

[[File:Via Tecta acropolis Pergamum 487 detail.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|View of the Acropolis of [[Pergamon]] in the background, as seen from Via Tecta at the entrance to the [[Asclepeion]].]]
[[File:AssosBurgberg.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Acropolis of [[Assos]]]]

The word ''acropolis'' literally means in [[Greek language|Greek]] "upper city," and though associated primarily with the [[Greece|Greek]] cities [[Athens]], [[Argos]] (with [[Larissa (Argos)|Larissa]]), [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] (with [[Cadmea]]), and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] (with its [[Acrocorinth]]), may be applied generically to all such citadels, including Rome, [[Jerusalem]], Celtic [[Bratislava]], many in [[Asia Minor]], or even [[Castle Rock, Edinburgh|Castle Rock]] in [[Edinburgh]]. An example in Ireland is the [[Rock of Cashel]]. Acropolis is also the term used by archaeologists and historians for the urban [[Castro culture]] settlements located in Northwestern Iberian hilltops.

The most famous example is the [[Acropolis of Athens]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/404 World Heritage: Acropolis, Athens ]&lt;/ref&gt; which, by reason of its historical associations and the several famous buildings erected upon it (most notably the [[Parthenon]]), is known without qualification as ''the Acropolis''. Although originating in the mainland of Greece, use of the acropolis model quickly spread to Greek colonies such as the [[Dorians|Dorian]] [[Lato]] on [[Crete]] during the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]].

== Metaphorical use in modern times ==

Because of its classical [[Hellenistic]] style, the ruins of [[Mission San Juan Capistrano|Mission San Juan Capistrano's]] Great Stone Church in [[California|California, United States]] has been called the "American Acropolis".&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Erik|title=The visionary state : a journey through California's spiritual landscape|date=2006|publisher=Chronicle Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0811848353|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other parts of the world developed other names for the high citadel or [[alcázar]], which often reinforced a naturally strong site. In Central [[Italy]], many small rural [[comune|communes]] still cluster at the base of a fortified habitation known as ''La Rocca'' of the commune.

The term ''acropolis'' is also used to describe the central complex of overlapping structures, such as plazas and pyramids, in many [[Maya city|Maya cities]], including [[Tikal]] and [[Copán]].

'''Athanasios "Tom" Asimakopulos''' ({{Lang-gr|Αθανάσιος Ασημακόπουλος}}) (May 28, 1930&amp;nbsp;– May 25, 1990) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[economist]], who was the "William Dow Professor of Political Economy" in the Department of Economics, [[McGill University]], [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.&lt;ref name=harcourt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harcourt|first1=G.C.|title=Athanasios (Tom) Asimakopulos, 1930-1990: A Memoir|journal=Journal of Post Keynesian Economics|date=1991|volume=14|issue=1|pages=39–48|jstor=4538271}}&lt;/ref&gt; His monograph, ''Keynes's General Theory and Accumulation'', reviews important areas of [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes's]] ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money|General Theory]]'' and the theories of [[Capital accumulation|accumulation]] of two of his most distinguished followers, [[Roy Harrod]] and [[Joan Robinson]].&lt;ref name=ATHAKEY&gt;Asimakopulos, Athanasios.

Cambridge University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-521-36815-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Asimakopulos was born in Montreal in 1930.  He was educated at [[McGill University]] earning a B.A. in 1951 and an M.A. in 1953. In September 1953 Tom went to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]; his research topic was a three-commodity, three-country study in international trade theory entitled ''Productivity Changes, the Trade Balance and the Terms of Trade''.&lt;ref name=TERMS&gt;Asimakopulos, A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2661902 ''A Note on Productivity Changes and the Terms of Trade'']. Oxford Economic Papers, New Series, Vol. 9, No. 2 (Jun., 1957), pp. 225–233.&lt;/ref&gt; With his classmate [[Keith Frearson]], the Australian economist, Tom went to [[Joan Robinson|Joan Robinson's]] lectures on what would become ''The Accumulation of Capital''&lt;ref name=ACCUMCAP&gt;Robinson, Joan. [https://www.questia.com/library/book/the-accumulation-of-capital-by-joan-robinson.jsp ''The Accumulation of Capital'']. London: Macmillan Company, 1965. First published 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; – Robinson's ''magnum opus'', which sought to extend [[Keynesian economics|Keynes's theory]] to account for long-run issues of growth and [[capital accumulation]]. Initially Asimakopulos was irritated by Robinson's criticisms  of the orthodox theories of value and distribution and [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical methodology]] on which he had been brought up. Asimakopulos also went regularly to research students's seminars run by [[Piero Sraffa]], [[Robin Marris]], and [[Nicholas Kaldor]].

Asimakopulos was a Lecturer in Economics and Political Science from 1956 to 1957 at McGill. From 1957 to 1959 he worked as an Assistant Professor at the Royal Military College. In 1959 he returned to McGill and became an assistant professor, working close to [[J.C. Weldon]]. Promoted to the position of associate professor in 1963, he became a full professor in 1966. In 1988 he was appointed ''"William Dow Professor of Political Economy"'' on Weldon's vacancy. He served as Chairman of the Department of Economics from 1974 to 1978. Teaching was his top priority; Asimakopulos loved teaching the microeconomics course to the Honours Students at McGill. Even though he had an assistant, Asimakopulos made sure that, from time to time, he gave tutorials himself, on which he would emphasize, ''ad nauseam'' the importance of the ''assumptions'' of the analysis and its implications on the results of the theoretical model studied.  He wrote extensively on the work of such economic theorists as J. M. Keynes, Joan Robinson, and [[Michał Kalecki]]. He was active in many professional associations and organizations. He held numerous fellowships and was a Visiting Professor and a Fellow at universities in the United States, England and Australia. From 1976 to 1990 he was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

Athanasios Asimakopulos died of leukemia in 1990.&lt;ref name=harcourt/&gt;

==Contributions to economic theory==
Asimakopulos was a [[Post Keynesian]] / "[[Michał Kalecki|Kaleckian]]" scholar, who elaborated upon Michał Kalecki's theories.&lt;ref name=KALECIANMODEL&gt;Lavoie, Marc. [http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/6/789 ''The Kaleckian model of growth and distribution and its neo-Ricardian and neo-Marxian critiques'']. Cambridge Journal of Economics 19 (6), 1993, pp. 789–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Asimakopulos wrote mainly around and on Keynesian themes and on growth, distribution and technical progress (the latter often with Weldon). Over time Kalecki's contributions came to be a major influence and interest; Tom came back to Kalecki, influenced by Joan Robinson. Kalecki stresses on determinants of income distribution, determinants of economic activity, determinants of profits, long-run growth, prospects of economy, or impact of imperfect competition on growth of income has been an important inspiration to many economists we call [[Post Keynesian]]s, including Asimakopulos.&lt;ref name= KALECKI1&gt;Nuti, D. M. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1132/is_n5_v39/ai_6123769 ''Michal Kalecki – excerpts from a paper entitled Michal Kalecki's Contributions to the Theory and Practice of Socialist Planning'']. Monthly Review, Oct. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=POSTKEYNES2&gt;[http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/postk.htm The American Post Keynesians] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418155213/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/postk.htm |date=April 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An advantage of theories that originate from Kalecki is that they are closer to what can be called "normal" theories. Kalecki's papers are acceptably formalized and not as extensively open to various interpretations as Keynes' ''General Theory''.&lt;ref name=KALECKINAMOD2&gt;Lavoie. Marc. [http://rrp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/28/4/113 ''Traverse, Hysteresis, and Normal Rates of Capacity Utilization in Kaleckian Models of Growth and Distribution'']. Review of Radical Political Economics 28 (4), 1996, 113–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Post Keynesians]] treat production side of the economy in their models, they usually inhabit their models with firms, which operate within neither perfectly competitive environment, nor within perfect monopoly setting. Post Keynesian firms usually set their prices as mark-ups above their prime costs. Profits of those firms usually, along with ''"animal spirits and expectations"'', have pronounced impact on investment decisions and therefore determine profits in the future. This double-sided relationship between profits and investment is clearly in spirit of Asimakopulos (1971)&lt;ref name=DETKEY&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/journals/00084239.html Asimakopulos, Athanasios. ''The Determination of Investment in Keynes's Model'', Canadian JE, 1971, vol. 4, issue 3, pp. 382–88.]&lt;/ref&gt; The most succinct definition of post-Keynesian economics comes from Joan Robinson:

::To me, the expression '''''post-Keynesian''''' has a definite meaning; it applies to an economic theory or method of analysis which takes account of the difference between the future and the past. {{small|(emphasis in the original)}} {{small|(1978; CEP, vol. V, 1979b, 210)}}

===Post Keynesianism===
The principal concern of [[Post Keynesians]] is to have a more complex and realistic aggregate [[supply and demand]] framework that includes mark-up pricing, the trend to monopoly, the workings of [[endogenous money]] and credit, circular and cumulative causation, and a pragmatic guide to policy. The workings of uncertainty lead to an unstable capitalistic system that requires the making of agreements and accords to promote stability. At the global level, it requires a fairer distribution of power such that the onus is on nations with trade surpluses to adjust their policies. More than anything, Post Keynesians eschew the quantity theory of money, since money and credit are seen to affect output and employment in both the short and long term. Indeed, like the institutionalists and Marxists, they see the capitalist economy as a monetary system of production, where money and [[creative financing]] are essential aspects of its functioning.&lt;ref name=POSTKEY1&gt;[http://hetsa.fec.anu.edu.au/review/ejournal/pdf/37-RA-2.pdf O'Hara, Phillip Anthony. ''The Revival of Political Economy and its Main Protagonists: 1960s to the Present''.

They all moved well and truly outside it, attempting to create either a revolutionary alternative or to rehabilitate the [[Marxist Socialism|classical Marxian tradition]], in most cases in the light of the [[Keynesians|Keynesian revolution]]. The one exception is Michał Kalecki, whose personal history and independent mind combined to place him virtually always outside the mainstream.

Asimakopulos however viewed himself as a [[Neoclassical economics|mainstream]] economist. He even declined an invitation to be included in the first edition of Philip Arestis and Malcolm Sawyer's ''A Biographical Dictionary of Dissenting Economists'',&lt;ref name=DICTDISSENT&gt;Arestis, Philip and Sawyer, Malcolm.

Edward Elgar Publishing, 2000, pp. 7–11. First published 1992. {{ISBN|1-85898-560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; because he regarded his views and contributions as belonging fully within the tradition of economics proper, not in a dissenting stream (he was included in the second edition).&lt;ref name=POSTKEY&gt;Harcourt, G.

====Asimakopulos' critique of Keynes' ''Marginal Efficiency of Investment''====
In his ''General Theory'', John Maynard Keynes proposed an investment function of the sort &lt;  I = I0 + I(r)  &gt; where the relationship between investment and interest rate was of a rather naive form. Firms were presumed to "rank" various investment projects depending on their ''"[[internal rate of return]]"'' (or ''"marginal efficiency of investment"'') and thereafter, faced with a given rate of interest, chose those projects whose internal rate of return exceeded the rate of interest. With an infinite number of projects available, this amounted to arguing that firms would invest until their marginal efficiency of investment was equal to the rate of interest, i.e. &lt;  MEI = r  &gt;.

Asimakopulos (1971, 1991), Piero Garegnani (1978) and several Post Keynesians offered a troublesome critique to Keynes' original formulation. Asimakopulos et al. questioned the very possibility of a downward-sloping ''Marginal Efficiency of Investment (MEI)'' function in the presence of unemployment. In particular, we can note that Keynes's multiplier story implies that if investment is undertaken then, by the multiplier, aggregate demand and output rises. But if the marginal efficiency of investment function is dependent on expected future returns, then should not the increased income and thus aggregate demand from the multiplier imply higher future returns? If so, then the MEI function ought to shift outwards to the right. This, in turn, implies that investment ought to increase  which leads to another increase in aggregate demand and thus the ''MEI'' curve shifts out again, raising investment, etc.&lt;ref name=KEYNESIRR&gt;Asimakopulos et al., [http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/capital/keynesreturn.htm ''J. M. Keynes's Internal Rate of Return''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418015246/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/capital/keynesreturn.htm |date=April 18, 2009 }}, at HET website.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, it is easy to conceive that, in situations of unemployment where the multiplier works its magic, investment is actually indeterminate&amp;nbsp;– or rather, an ever-shifting ''MEI'' curve could imply that all investment projects will be eventually undertaken and not merely those that are profitable at the given rate of interest since the profitability of projects is itself a function of aggregate demand and thus endogenous to the problem.

==Quotes on Asimakopulos==
::Tom Asimakopulos was a great Kaleckian scholar. His knowledge of the nuances and innuendos of Kalecki's approach to macroeconomics had no equal. {{small|Paul Davidson, Journal of Economic Issues.}}

::This book (''Keynes's General Theory and Accumulation'') is the legacy of a dedicated and tough-minded scholar who did his heroes the compliment of taking their work seriously, rather than just praising it. {{small|Robert W. Dimand, History of Political Economy.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2205">'''Beech Bottom Dyke''', is a large ditch running for almost a mile at the northern edge of [[St Albans]], [[Hertfordshire]] flanked by banks on both sides.  It is up to {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep, and it can be followed for three quarters of a mile between the "Ancient Briton Crossroads" on the St Albans to [[Harpenden]] road until it is crossed by the [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]]/[[Midland Main Line|Midland]] mainline railway at [[Sandridge]]. Beyond the railway embankment it continues, to finish just short of the St Albans to Sandridge road. This part is not accessible to the public.

It was constructed towards the end of the [[Iron Age]],&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1019136 |desc=Iron Age territorial boundary known as Beech Bottom Dyke |accessdate=2015-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; probably between 5 and 40&amp;nbsp;AD. This, and other similar earthworks in the district, may have been built by the powerful Celtic tribe established in this area, the [[Catuvellauni]], probably by [[Cunobelinus|King Cunobelinus]] to define areas of land around their tribal centre at [[Verlamion]] - the predecessor of the Roman city of [[Verulamium]].

Beech Bottom Dyke is thought{{by who|date=December 2012}} to have originally been part of a defensive system for a Belgaic settlement. Other defences are the [[Devil's Dyke, Hertfordshire|Devil's Dyke]] and another ancient earthwork known as "[[The Slad]]". These may have created a defensive earthwork running from the [[River Lea]] to the [[River Ver]] enclosing a very large area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5042">A '''Citizens’ Initiative Review''' (CIR) is modeled on the [[Citizens’ jury]] and is a form of [[deliberative democracy]].  A panel of citizens meets to deliberate on a ballot [[initiative]] or [[referendum]] that voters in the same jurisdiction (such as a city, state, province, or country) will be deciding in an upcoming election.  The panelists are chosen through means such as [[random sampling]] and [[stratified sampling]] to be demographically representative of the relevant population.  To ensure that the panel is a manageable size for face-to-face deliberation, a CIR caps the number of participants at around two dozen.  They are often paid for their time and travel so that the broadest possible range of citizens can participate.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.innovations.harvard.edu/citizens-initiative-review&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, only the state of Oregon has passed a law to enact a permanent version of the CIR.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Richards, “Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review” http://participedia.net/en/methods/citizens-initiative-review&lt;/ref&gt; The states of Colorado, Arizona, and Massachusetts have conducted pilot tests of the CIR.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cirmass2016.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpr.org/news/story/experiment-help-voters-understand-colorado-ballot-measures&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.psu.edu/citizensinitiativereview/files/2015/01/CIR-2016-Arizona-Report-26npu2z.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The operations of a CIR are typically assisted by a moderator who is trained to ensure that all panelists engage in the deliberations.  Over the course of a few days, the panelists not only deliberate among themselves but also question policy experts and advocates on both sides of the initiative.  The panelists write a statement describing their deliberations in a form that can be publicized though means such as including it in the voter’s pamphlet.  This statement summarizes what the panelists believed were the best arguments pro and con, and it lists the number of panelists who recommended voting both for and against the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Richards, “Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review” http://participedia.net/en/methods/citizens-initiative-review&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==
Consistent with other forms of deliberative democracy, a CIR tries to strengthen the quality and impact of the public voice in elections and government decisions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.natcom.org/communication-currents/evaluating-new-governing-institution-assessment-citizens%E2%80%99-initiative-review&lt;/ref&gt;  The CIR addresses specific concerns about initiative campaigns where voters often receive little information at all, or else what they hear—for example, from paid advertisements—is biased or conflicting.&lt;ref&gt;John Gastil, “Beyond Endorsements and Partisan Cues:  Given Voters Viable Alternaties to Unreliable Cognitive Shortcuts” http://sites.psu.edu/citizensinitiativereview/wp-content/uploads/sites/23162/2015/01/Gastil-2014-Beyond-Endorsements-and-Partisan-Cues-Giving-Vote.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Under a CIR, voters learn what a representative body of citizens thought about the initiative after studying it carefully and deliberating among themselves.  

==Evaluation==
Academic research shows that the panelists in the Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review have achieved high-quality deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine R. Knobloch, John Gastil, Justin Reedy, and Katherine Cramer Walsh, “Did They Deliberate? Applying an Evaluative Model of Democratic Deliberation to the Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review” http://sites.psu.edu/citizensinitiativereview/wp-content/uploads/sites/23162/2015/01/DidTheyDeliberate.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Voters became aware of those deliberations through the voters’ pamphlet and found the panelists’ statement to be helpful to their decisions, and voter knowledge about the initiatives increased as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine R. Knobloch, John Gastil, Traci Feller, and Robert C. Richards, “Empowering Citizen Deliberation in Direct Democratic Elections: A Field Study of the 2012 Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review” http://factsreports.revues.org/3448&lt;/ref&gt; The panelists themselves developed new attitudes about the political process and their own capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine R. Knobloch and John Gastil, “Civic (Re)socialisation: The Educative Effects of Deliberative Participation” http://sites.psu.edu/citizensinitiativereview/wp-content/uploads/sites/23162/2015/01/Civic-resocialization.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Informing the voting public of what the panelists recommended, rather than just summarizing the pro and con arguments that panelists found most persuasive, may short-circuit voters’ own deliberations by allowing them to simply adopt the panelists’ recommendation. &lt;ref&gt;James Fishkin, "Deliberation by the People Themselves:  Entry Points for the Public Voice" http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/elj.2013.0200&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Pipes''' (born September 9, 1949) is an American historian, writer, and commentator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/richard-pipes-historian-who-helped-shape-reagan-era-soviet-policy-dies-at-94/2018/05/19/0dc2d5c4-5b78-11e8-8836-a4a123c359ab_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.b3792ce72d74 |title= Richard Pipes, historian who helped shape Reagan-era Soviet policy, dies at 94 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=May 19, 2018 |first=Matt|last=Schudel|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the president of the [[Middle East Forum]], and publisher of its ''[[Middle East Quarterly]]'' journal. His writing focuses on American foreign policy and the Middle East.

After graduating with a PhD from [[Harvard]] in 1978 and studying abroad, Pipes taught at a number of universities, including Harvard, [[University of Chicago|Chicago]], [[Pepperdine University|Pepperdine]], and the [[U.S. Naval War College]] for short stints but never secured a permanent academic position.&lt;ref name ="Lockman" /&gt; He then served as director of the [[Foreign Policy Research Institute]], before founding the Middle East Forum. He served as an adviser to [[Rudy Giuliani]]'s [[Rudy Giuliani presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN1641392220071119 |title= Giuliani style evokes concern among critics |work=[[Reuters]] |date=November 19, 2007 |first=Ellen|last=Wulfhorst|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipes has written sixteen books and was the Taube Distinguished Visiting Fellow at [[Stanford University]]'s [[Hoover Institution]].&lt;ref name=Hoover&gt;[http://www.hoover.org/fellows/9955 Daniel Pipes], Fellows, [[Hoover Institution]] website. Accessed July 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
The son of Irene (née Roth) and [[Richard Pipes]], Daniel Pipes was born in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], in 1949.&lt;ref name=Press&gt;{{cite news

''Vixi: memoirs of a non-belonger''. 2006, page 2; page 50&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Richard Pipes, was a historian at [[Harvard University]], specializing in Russia, and Daniel Pipes grew up primarily in the [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] area.

Pipes attended the Harvard pre-school, then received a private school education, partly abroad. He enrolled in Harvard University, where his father was a professor, in the fall of 1967. For his first two years he studied [[mathematics]] but has said "I wasn't smart enough. So I chose to become a historian."&lt;ref name=Tassel&gt;{{cite news|first=Janet|last=Tassel|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2005/01/militant-about-islamism.html|title=Militant about "Islamism"|work=[[Harvard Magazine]]|accessdate=May 26, 2016|date=January–February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he "found the material too abstract."&lt;ref name=Ballon&gt;{{cite news |title=Daniel Pipes fights the worldwide threat of Islamism – from Malibu|url=http://www.danielpipes.org/article/4326 |last=Ballon|first=Marc|work=[[Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]|date=March 6, 2007|accessdate=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He credits visits to the [[Sahara Desert]] in 1968 and the [[Sinai Desert]] in 1969 for piquing his interest in the [[Arabic language]],&lt;ref name=Tassel/&gt; and travels in West Africa for piquing his interest in the Islamic world. He subsequently changed his major to Middle Eastern history,&lt;ref name=Ballon/&gt; for the next two years studying [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and the Middle East, and obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[history]] in 1971. His senior thesis was titled "A Medieval Islamic Debate: The World Created in Eternity," a study of Muslim philosophers and [[Al-Ghazali]].&lt;ref name=Tassel/&gt;  After graduating in 1971, Pipes spent two years in [[Cairo, Egypt|Cairo]], where he continued learning Arabic and studied the [[Quran]], which he states gave him an appreciation for Islam.&lt;ref name=Ballon/&gt; He wrote a book on colloquial [[Egyptian Arabic]], published in 1983. In all, he studied abroad for six years, three of them in [[Egypt]].

==Career==

===Work in academia===
Pipes returned to Harvard in 1973 and, after further studies abroad (in Freiburg-im-Breisgau and Cairo), obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in medieval Islamic history&lt;ref name=Press/&gt; in 1978. His Ph.D. dissertation eventually became his first book, ''Slave Soldiers and Islam'', in 1981. He switched his academic interest from medieval Islamic studies to modern Islam in the late 1970s, with the rise of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] and the [[Iranian revolution]].&lt;ref name=Press/&gt;

He taught world history at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1978 to 1982, history at Harvard from 1983 to 1984, and policy and strategy at the [[Naval War College]] from 1984 to 1986. In 1983, Pipes served on the policy-planning staff at the State Department in 1982–83.&lt;ref&gt;Arabists: The Romance of an American Elite, Kaplan, Robert D., p. 287, Simon and Schuster, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-academia ===
Pipes largely left academia after 1986, though in 2007 he taught a course titled "International Relations: Islam and Politics" as a visiting professor at [[Pepperdine University]]'s [[Pepperdine School of Public Policy|School of Public Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepperdine.edu/pr/releases/2006/december/danielpipes.htm|title=School of Public Policy Announces 2007 Distinguished Visiting Professor: Daniel Pipes|publisher=[[Pepperdine University]]|accessdate=May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pipes told an interviewer from ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'' that he has "the simple politics of a truck driver, not the complex ones of an academic. My viewpoint is not congenial with institutions of higher learning."&lt;ref name=Tassel/&gt;

From 1986 on, Pipes worked for various think tanks. From 1986 to 1993 he was director of the [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]-based [[Foreign Policy Research Institute]] (FPRI) and editor of its journal, ''[[Orbis (foreign policy)|Orbis]]''. In 1990 he organized the [[Middle East Forum]] as a unit of FPRI; it became an independent organization with himself as head in January 1994.  Pipes edited its journal, the ''[[Middle East Quarterly]]'', until 2001. He established [[Campus Watch]] as a project of the Middle East Forum in 2002, followed by the Legal Project in 2005, Islamist Watch in 2006, and the Washington Project in 2009.

In 2003, President [[George W. Bush]] nominated Pipes for the board of the [[United States Institute of Peace]]. A [[filibuster]] was launched by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senators in the [[United States Senate]] against Pipes' nomination.&lt;ref name=LATedit&gt;{{cite news|title=A Misdirected Attack: Editorial|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/aug/17/opinion/ed-pipes17|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 17, 2003|accessdate=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Senator [[Tom Harkin]] said that he was "offended" by Pipes' comments on Islam, and that while "some people call [Pipes] a scholar... this is not the kind of person you want on the USIP."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimorechronicle.com/jul03_pipes-stalled.html|title=Daniel Pipes nomination stalled in committee|work=[[Baltimore Chronicle]]|date=July 23, 2003|accessdate=May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While defending Pipes' nomination, White House spokesman [[Ari Fleischer]] distanced Bush from Pipes's views, saying that Bush "disagrees with Pipes about whether Islam is a peaceful religion".&lt;ref name=Stevenson/&gt; Pipes obtained the position by [[recess appointment]]&lt;ref name=Tassel/&gt; and served on the board until early 2005. His nomination was protested by [[Muslim]] groups in the U.S., and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] leaders, who cited his oft-stated belief that victory is the most effective way to terminate conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.husainhaqqani.com/2003/07/|title=Where’s the Muslim Debate?|last=Haqqani|first=Husain|date=July 2003|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lockman&gt;Lockman, Zachary. ''Contending visions of the Middle East''. 2004, page 257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hagopian, Elaine Catherine. ''Civil rights in peril''. 2004, page 113&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that "in trying to prevent Middle East scholar Daniel Pipes from joining the board of the U.S. Institute of Peace, Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) are abusing their privilege."&lt;ref name="LATedit" /&gt;

==''Campus Watch''==
{{Main|Campus Watch}}

Pipes' think tank the [[Middle East Forum]]  established a website in 2002 called [[Campus Watch]], which identified what it saw as five problems in the teaching of Middle Eastern studies at American universities: "analytical failures, the mixing of politics with scholarship, intolerance of alternative views, [[apologetics]], and the abuse of power over students." According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Campus Watch is the project for which Pipes is "perhaps best known."&lt;ref name=Elliott&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/nyregion/28school.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;oref=slogin | title=Critics Cost Muslim Educator Her Dream School |first=Andrea |last=Elliot |date=April 27, 2008 |accessdate=May 3, 2008 |work= [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through Campus Watch, Pipes encouraged students and faculty to submit information on "Middle East-related scholarship, lectures, classes, demonstrations, and other activities relevant to Campus Watch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campus-watch.org/incident.php |title=Keep Us Informed |publisher=Campus Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was accused of "[[McCarthyism|McCarthyesque]] intimidation" of professors who criticized [[Israel]] when it published "dossiers" on eight professors it thought "hostile" to America. In protest, more than 100 academics demanded to be added to what some called a "blacklist". In October 2002 Campus Watch removed the dossiers from its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/09/28/MN227890.DTL | title = Professors want own names put on Mideast blacklist – They hope to make it powerless | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | first = Tanya | last = Schevitz | date = September 28, 2002 | accessdate = March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/416 | title = Column a slur on Muslim community | first = Hussam | last = Ayloush | work = [[Orange County Register]] | date = December 1, 2002 | accessdate = March 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/209 | title = 'Dossiers' dropped from Web blacklist | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | first = Tanya | last = Schevitz | date = October 3, 2002 | accessdate = March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McNeil&gt;{{cite news |first=Kristine |last=McNeil |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/war-academic-freedom/ |title=The War on Academic Freedom |work=[[The Nation]] |date=November 11, 2002 |accessdate=October 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

===Radical and moderate Islam===
{{Criticism of Islam sidebar}}
Pipes has long expressed alarm about what he believes to be the dangers of "radical" or "[[militant Islam]]" to the Western world. In 1985, he wrote in ''Middle East Insight'' that "[t]he scope of the radical fundamentalist's ambition poses novel problems; and the intensity of his onslaught against the United States makes solutions urgent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.danielpipes.org/article/266 | title = "Death to America" in Lebanon | first=Daniel|last=Pipes | work = Middle East Insight | date = March–April 1985 | accessdate = March 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall 1995 issue of ''[[National Interest]]'', he wrote: "Unnoticed by most Westerners, war has been unilaterally declared on Europe and the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = There Are No Moderates: Dealing with Fundamentalist Islam
| url = http://www.danielpipes.org/article/274 | work = [[National Interest]] | date = Fall 1995 | first=Daniel |last=Pipes | accessdate = March 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote this in the aftermath of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]]; investigative journalist [[Steven Emerson]] had said in the aftermath of the bombing that it bore a "Middle Eastern trait." Pipes agreed with Emerson and told ''[[USA Today]]'' that the United States was "under attack" and that [[Islamic fundamentalists]] "are targeting us."&lt;ref name=Press/&gt; Shortly after this, the bombing was determined by police to have been carried out by American anti-government terrorists [[Timothy McVeigh]], [[Terry Nichols]], and Michael Fortier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/crime/national/1995/oklahoma_city_bombing/ok.html |title=Library Factfiles: The Oklahoma City Bombing |work=[[The Indianapolis Star]] |date=August 9, 2004 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5woxdTSa9?url=http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/crime/national/1995/oklahoma_city_bombing/ok.html |archivedate=February 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four months before the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Pipes and Emerson wrote in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that [[al Qaeda]] was "planning new attacks on the U.S." and that [[Iran]]ian operatives "helped arrange advanced ... training for al Qaeda personnel in [[Lebanon]] where they learned, for example, how to destroy large buildings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.danielpipes.org/article/381 |title=Terrorism on Trial|first=Steven|last=Emerson|author2=Daniel Pipes|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=May 31, 2001|accessdate=May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipes wrote in 2007, "It’s a mistake to blame Islam, a religion 14 centuries old, for the evil that should be ascribed to militant Islam, a totalitarian ideology less than a century old. Militant Islam is the problem, but moderate Islam is the solution."&lt;ref name=Tassel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Daniel| last=Pipes| url=http://www.danielpipes.org/article/4497| title=A Million Moderate Muslims on the March|work=[[New York Sun]]|date= May 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pipes described moderate Muslims as "a very small movement" in comparison to "the Islamist onslaught" and said that the U.S. government "should give priority to locating, meeting with, funding, forwarding, empowering, and celebrating" them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.danielpipes.org/article/4426|title=Bolstering Moderate Muslims|last=Pipes|first=Daniel|date=2007-04-17|work=[[New York Sun]]|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429071909/http://www.danielpipes.org/article/4426|archive-date=2007-04-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipes has praised [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] in Turkey and the Sudanese thinker [[Mahmoud Mohamed Taha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Daniel |last=Pipes |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1208356966718&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708210504/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1208356966718&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 8, 2012 |work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |title=A democratic Islam? |date=April 16, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a September 2008 interview by [[Peter Robinson (speechwriter)|Peter Robinson]], Pipes stated that Muslims can be divided into three categories: "traditional Islam", which he sees as pragmatic and non-violent, "Islamism", which he sees as dangerous and militant, and "moderate Islam", which he sees as underground and not yet codified into a popular movement. He elaborated that he did not have the "theological background" to determine what group follows the [[Koran]] the closest and is truest to its intent.&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;{{YouTube|Q7h3i0SHy3A|The Middle East with Daniel Pipes}}. ''[[Uncommon Knowledge]]''. [[Hoover Institution]]. Published September 23, 2008. Accessed July 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslims in Europe===
In 1990, Pipes wrote in ''[[National Review]]'' that Western European societies were "unprepared for the massive immigration of brown-skinned peoples cooking strange foods and maintaining different standards of hygiene ... Muslim immigrants bring with them a chauvinism that augurs badly for their integration into the mainstream of the European societies." At that time, he believed Muslim immigrants would "probably not change the face of European life" and might "even bring much of value, including new energy, to their host societies".&lt;ref name="MuslimsComing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danielpipes.org/rr/198.html|title=The Muslims are Coming!

In retrospect, I should either have put the words 'brown-skinned peoples' and 'strange foods' in quotation marks or made it clearer that I was explaining European attitudes rather than my own."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.danielpipes.org/198/the-muslims-are-coming-the-muslims-are-coming|title=The Muslims are Coming!

In 2006, Daniel Pipes said that certain neighborhoods in [[France]] were "no-go zones" and "that the French state no longer has full control over its territory." In 2013, Pipes traveled to several of these neighborhoods and admitted he was mistaken. In 2015 he sent an email to ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'' saying that there are "no European countries with no-go zones."&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-14/debunking-the-muslim-nogo-zone-myth|title=Debunking the Myth of Muslim-Only Zones in Major European Cities|date=2015-01-14|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Muhammad cartoons controversy]], Pipes wrote that the "key issue at stake" was whether the "West [would] stand up for its customs and mores, including freedom of speech" and the "right to insult and blasphemy". He supported [[Robert Spencer (writer)|Robert Spencer]]'s call to "stand resolutely with Denmark." He lauded Norway, Germany and France for their stance on the cartoons and freedom of speech, but criticized Poland, Britain, New Zealand and the United States for giving statements he interpreted as "wrongly apologizing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Daniel|last=Pipes| url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/cartoons-and-islamic-imperialism/27151/ |title=Cartoons and Islamic Imperialism |work=[[New York Sun]] |date=February 7, 2006|accessdate=May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his Middle East Forum, Pipes fund-raised for the Dutch politician [[Geert Wilders]] during his [[Trial of Geert Wilders|trial]], according to ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vorige.nrc.nl/binnenland/article2544752.ece/Partners_Wilders_in_VS_verdienen_aan_acties_tegen_moslimextremisme|title=Partners Wilders in VS verdienen aan acties teen moslimextremisme|date=May 15, 2010|language=nl|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012085802/http://vorige.nrc.nl/binnenland/article2544752.ece/Partners_Wilders_in_VS_verdienen_aan_acties_tegen_moslimextremisme|archivedate=October 12, 2011|df=}}  Pipes is quoted saying he collected in 2009 a 6-digit figure for the party of Wilders.&lt;/ref&gt; Pipes has praised Wilders as "the unrivaled leader of those Europeans who wish to retain their historic [European] identity"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/228978/why-i-stand-geert-wilders-daniel-pipes|title=Why I Stand with Geert Wilders |author=Daniel Pipes|newspaper=National Review|date=Jan 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called him "the most important politician in Europe."

===Muslims in the United States===
Some commentators have argued that Pipes' writings on Muslims contain [[racist]] elements, often citing the following quote from a work that Pipes authored in 1990:&lt;ref name=patton&gt;{{Cite web| last = Patton| first = Chloe| title = Daniel Pipes Comes to Melbourne: Are Australian Muslims Right to be Outraged?| work = ABC Religion &amp; Ethics| format = Text| accessdate = 2018-11-19| date = 2018-03-08| url = https://www.abc.net.au/religion/daniel-pipes-comes-to-melbourne-are-australian-muslims-right-to-/10094914}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Fears of a Muslim influx have more substance than the worry about jihad. Western European societies are unprepared for the massive immigration of brown-skinned peoples cooking strange foods and maintaining different standards of hygiene."&lt;/blockquote&gt; Pipes has since said that he intended to ""characterise the thinking of Western Europeans" and that the comments should not be taken as representative of his own views.&lt;ref name=patton /&gt;

In October 2001 Pipes said before a convention of the [[American Jewish Congress]]: "I worry very much, from the Jewish point of view, that the presence, and increased stature, and affluence, and enfranchisement of American Muslims, because they are so much led by an Islamist leadership, that this will present true dangers to American Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pipes|first= Daniel | url=http://www.danielpipes.org/article/1414 | title=A French lesson for Tom Harkin |work=[[World Net Daily]] |date=January 5, 2004|accessdate=May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferguson |first=Barbara |url=http://www.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=59612&amp;d=27&amp;m=2&amp;y=2005 | title=Daniel Pipes Continuing His Campaign Against Muslims |work=[[Arab News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that American Muslims were "enraged" by Pipes' arguments that Muslims in government and military positions be given special attention as security risks and his opining that mosques are "breeding grounds for militants."&lt;ref name="Stevenson"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E5DE133DF93BA15757C0A9659C8B63|title=For Muslims, a Mixture Of White House Signals|last=Stevenson|first=Richard|date=April 28, 2003|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=November 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2004 article in the [[New York Sun]], Pipes endorsed a defense of the [[internment of Japanese Americans]] during World War II, and linked the [[Japanese-American]] wartime situation to that of [[Muslim Americans]] today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hnn.us/node/9289|title=Japanese Internment: Why It Was a Good Idea – And the Lessons It Offers Today|newspaper=New York Sun|date=December 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/articles/9512.html|title=Japanese Internment: Why Daniel Pipes Is Wrong|author=Irfan Khawaja|publisher=[[History News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipes has criticized the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR), which he says is an "[[apologist]]" for [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]], and has a "roster of employees and board members connected to terrorism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Daniel Pipes |author2=Sharon Chadha | url=http://www.danielpipes.org/article/3437 | title=CAIR: Islamists Fooling the Establishment | work=[[Middle East Quarterly]] | date=Spring 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CAIR, in turn, has said that "Pipes' writings are full of distortions and innuendo."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/09/23/Worldandnation/With_CAIR__compromise.shtml | title=With CAIR, compromise complicated: The American Muslim group's stated goal is understanding.

''[[The New York Times]]'' cited Pipes as helping to lead the charge against [[Debbie Almontaser]], a woman with a "longstanding reputation as a Muslim moderate" whom Pipes viewed as a representative of a pernicious new movement of "lawful Islamists."  Almontaser resigned under pressure as principal of [[Khalil Gibran International Academy]], an Arabic-language high school in New York City named after the famed Christian Arab-American poet. Pipes initially described the school as a "[[madrassa]]", which means school in Arabic but, in the West, carries the implication of Islamist teaching, though he later admitted that his use of the term had been "a bit of a stretch".&lt;ref name=Elliott/&gt;  Pipes explained his opposition: "It is hard to see how violence, how terrorism will lead to the implementation of sharia. It is much easier to see how, working through the system—the school system, the media, the religious organizations, the government, businesses and the like—you can promote radical Islam."&lt;ref name=Elliott/&gt; Pipes had also stated that “Arabic-language instruction is inevitably laden with Pan-Arabist and Islamist baggage.”&lt;ref name=Elliott/&gt;

===Views on U.S. foreign policy===
Pipes was a firm supporter of the [[Vietnam War]], and when his fellow students occupied the Harvard administration building to protest it in the 1960s, he sided with the administration.&lt;ref name=Press/&gt; Pipes had previously considered himself to be a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], but after anti-war [[George McGovern]] gained the [[United States presidential election, 1972#Democratic nomination|1972 Democratic nomination]] for [[POTUS|President]], he switched to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name=Press/&gt; Pipes used to accept being described as a "[[neoconservative]]", once saying that "others see me that way, and, you know, maybe I am one of them."&lt;ref name="pipes_01"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mark&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/cgi-bin/common/printfriendly.pl?/pm/content/2006/s1603043.htm|title= US led coalition no longer responsible for Iraq: Daniel Pipes |publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |last =Colvin |first =Mark |date= March 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he explicitly rejected the label in April 2009 due to differences with the [[neoconservative]] positions on democracy and Iraq, now considering himself a "plain [[American conservative|conservative]]".&lt;ref name="pipes_01"&gt;{{cite news

In 2016, Pipes resigned from the Republican Party after it endorsed [[Donald Trump]] as its 2016 presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danielpipes.org/16834/why-i-just-quit-the-gop|title=Why I Just Quit the Republican Party|author=Daniel Pipes|date=2016-07-21|publisher=Daniel Pipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab–Israeli conflict===
Pipes is a supporter of [[Israel]] in the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and an opponent of a [[Two-state solution|Palestinian state]]. He wrote in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' in April 1990 that "there can be either an Israel or a Palestine, but not both ... to those who ask why the Palestinians must be deprived of a state, the answer is simple: grant them one and you set in motion a chain of events that will lead either to its extinction or the extinction of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danielpipes.org/article/194 |title=Can the Palestinians Make Peace? |first=Daniel |last=Pipes |publisher=''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' with alterations by Daniel Pipes, reprinted on DanielPipes.org |date=April 1990 |accessdate=May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pipes has proposed a [[three state solution]] to the conflict, in which Gaza would be given to Egypt and the West Bank to Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;"Solving the 'Palestinian Problem,'" by Daniel Pipes, ''Jerusalem Post'', January 7, 2009 [http://www.danielpipes.org/article/6110]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, he said, "Palestinians do not accept the existence of a Jewish state. Until that change, I don't see any point in having any kind of negotiations whatsoever." He also described the Israeli public as focused on a mistaken policy that he considers to be "[[appeasement]]".&lt;ref name=robinson/&gt;

===Iran===
Pipes' opposition to Iran is long-standing. In 1980, Pipes wrote that "Iran made the transition to a post-oil economy. It is the only major oil exporter to abandon the heady billions and return to live by its own means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Daniel |last=Pipes |url=http://www.danielpipes.org/article/1026 |title=Iran's Good Fortune |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 10, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pipes was critical of the [[Reagan administration]] for its role in the [[Iran–Contra affair]], writing that "American actions also helped to legitimize other kinds of help for, and capitulation to, the Ayatollah."&lt;ref name=tilt&gt;"&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Pipes |url=http://www.danielpipes.org/5330/back-iraq |last2=Mylroie |first2=Laurie |title=Back Iraq: It's time for a U.S. ‘tilt' |work=[[The New Republic]] |date=April 27, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010 Pipes advocated that U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] "give orders for the U.S. military to destroy Iran’s nuclear-weapon capacity. ... The time to act is now."&lt;ref name="BombIran"&gt;{{cite news|first=Daniel |last=Pipes |url=http://www.danielpipes.org/article/1026 |title=How to Save the Obama Presidency: Bomb Iran |work=[[The National Review]] |date=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that "circumstances are propitious" for the U.S. to initiate a bombing of Iran, and that "no one other than the Iranian rulers and their agents denies that the regime is rushing headlong to build a large nuclear arsenal." He further states that a unilateral U.S. bombing of Iran "would require few 'boots on the ground' and entail relatively few casualties, making an attack more politically palatable."&lt;ref name="BombIran" /&gt;

Pipes advocates that the U.S. support the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] (MEK) against the Iranian government.&lt;ref name="Unleash"&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Pipes |url=http://www.danielpipes.org/article/4747 |title=Unleash the Iranian Opposition|publisher=''[[New York Sun]]'' with alterations by Daniel Pipes, reprinted on DanielPipes.org |date=July 10, 2007 |accessdate=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MEK&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/2012/02/resettling-the-mujahedeen-e-khalq-of-iraq|title=Resettling the Mujahedeen-e Khalq of Iraq|newspaper=National Review Online|author=Daniel Pipes|date=Feb 28, 2012|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously listed as a terrorist group by the U.S. and the European Union, Pipes had long advocated a change in that listing.&lt;ref name=MEK/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/13/john-kerry-mek_n_4960059.html|title=John Kerry Gets Pressed To Grant Asylum To Former Terrorist Group MEK|author=Christina Wilkie|date=March 13, 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pipes had described this listing as a "sop to the mullahs". He writes, "the MEK poses no danger to Americans or Europeans, and has not for decades. It does pose a danger to the malign, bellicose theocratic regime in Tehran."&lt;ref name="Unleash" /&gt;

==Reactions==
''[[Boston Globe]]'' columnist [[Jeff Jacoby (columnist)|Jeff Jacoby]] writes: "To hear his critics tell it, Pipes is an '[[Islamophobia|Islamophobe]]'", but in Jacoby's view, "these are gross and vicious libels."&lt;ref name=Jacoby&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.danielpipes.org/article/1129 |title=Pipes's effective route to peace |publisher=Daniel Pipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tashbih Sayyed]], former editor of the ''Muslim World Today'' and the ''Pakistan Times'' (not the Pakistani newspaper of the same name), stated about Pipes, "He must be listened to. If there is no Daniel Pipes, there is no source for America to learn to recognize the evil which threatens it... Muslims in America that are like Samson; they have come into the temple to pull down the pillars, even if it means destroying themselves."&lt;ref name=Tassel/&gt; Similarly, [[Ahmed Subhy Mansour]], a former visiting fellow at [[Harvard Law School]], writes, "We Muslims need a thinker like Dr. Pipes, who can criticize the terrorist culture within Islam."&lt;ref name=Tassel/&gt;

In ''[[The Nation]]'', [[Brooklyn]] writer Kristine McNeil described Pipes in 2003 as an "[[anti-Arab]] propagandist" who has built a career out of "distortions... twist[ing] words, quot[ing] people out of context and stretch[ing] the truth to suit his purpose".&lt;ref name=McNeil/&gt;

===Academic reception===
[[Daniel C. Peterson]], professor of Islamic Studies and Arabic at [[Brigham Young University]], thinks positively of Daniel Pipes' works, that he is "a legitimate, well-trained scholar, and very bright." Peterson also worries about what he thinks is a campaign to blacken and marginalize Daniel Pipes, because "if he’s wrong, that should be demonstrated with evidence and analysis, not by name-calling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel C Peterson On Daniel Pipes|url=http://ldspatriot.wordpress.com/2006/02/11/daniel-c-peterson-on-daniel-pipes/|publisher=LDS Patriot|accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zachary Lockman, Professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies and History, wrote in 2005 that Pipes "acquired a reputation in Muslim American circles as an 'Islamophobe' and 'Muslim basher' whose writings and public utterances aroused fear and suspicion toward Muslims". He stated that Pipes's remarks "could plausibly be understood as inciting suspicion and mistrust of Muslims, including Muslim Americans, and as derogatory of Islam".&lt;ref name ="Lockman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lockman |first1=Zachary |title=Critique from the Right: The Neo-conservative Assault on Middle East Studies |journal=CR: The New Centennial Review |date=2005 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=63–110 |doi=10.1353/ncr.2005.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Zogby]] argues that Pipes possesses an "obsessive hatred of all things Muslim", and that "Pipes is to Muslims what [[David Duke]] is to African-Americans".&lt;ref name=Jacoby/&gt; [[Christopher Hitchens]], a fellow supporter of the [[Iraq War]] and critic of political Islam, also criticized Pipes, arguing that Pipes pursued an intolerant agenda, and was one who "confuses scholarship with propaganda", and "pursues petty vendettas with scant regard for objectivity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2003/08/pipes_the_propagandist.html|title=Pipes the propagandist|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens| work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=August 11, 2003|accessdate=May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Pipes was invited to speak at the [[University of Toronto]] in March 2005, a letter from professors and graduate students asserted that Pipes had a "long record of xenophobic, racist and sexist speech that goes back to 1990".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050329/PIPES29/National/Idx/|title=Visit by pro-Israeli prof causes uproar at UofT |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |first=Caroline |last= Alphonso |date=March 29, 2005}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but university officials said they would not interfere with Pipes's visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thevarsity.ca/articles/15401l |title=Open Letter |work=The Varsity}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pipes wrote an article about his experience at York University, also in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pipes|first=Daniel|title=The rot in our [Canadian] universities|url=http://www.danielpipes.org/1013/the-rot-in-our-canadian-universities|publisher=danielpipes.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[John L. Esposito]] of [[Georgetown University]] has called Pipes "a bright, well-trained expert with considerable experience", but accuses Pipes of "selectivity and distortion" when asserting that "10 to 15 percent of the world's Muslims are militants". In summation, Esposito complains that  equation of "mainstream and extremist[s] Islam under the rubric of militant Islam" while identifying "moderate Islam as secular or cultural" can mislead "uninformed or uncritical readers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Militant Islam Reaches America (Daniel Pipes)|work=The American Muslim|date=October 17, 2002|author=[[John L.

==Allegations against Barack Obama==

Pipes wrote in 2008 that many in the Muslim world believe [[Barack Obama]] is or was a Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Obama-through-Muslim-eyes|title=Obama Through Muslim Eyes|author=Daniel Pipes|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=August 25, 2008|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pipes alleged that Obama falsely claims that he had never been a Muslim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/national/in-cleveland-obama-speaks-on-jewish-issues/71813/|title=In Cleveland, Obama Speaks on Jewish Issues|newspaper=New York Sun|date=Feb 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that his "campaign appears to be either ignorant or fabricating when it states that Obama never prayed in a mosque."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danielpipes.org/article/5286 Was Obma Ever a Muslim?] Danielpipes.org December 24, 2007.

According to Pipes, "this matters" because Democratic presidential candidate Obama "is now what Islamic law calls a ''murtadd'' (apostate), an ex-Muslim converted to another religion who must be executed", and as president this would have "large potential implications for his relationship with the Muslim world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danielpipes.org/article/5354 |last=Pipes |first=Daniel |title=Confirmed: Barack Obama Practiced Islam |work=[[FrontPage Magazine]] |date=January 7, 2008|accessdate=May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Smith (journalist)|Ben Smith]], in an article on ''[[Politico]]'', responded to these accusations, stating that they amounted to a "template for a faux-legitimate assault on Obama's religion" and that Daniel Pipes' work "is pretty stunning in the twists of its logic".&lt;ref&gt;Ben Smith: [http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1207/The_Muslim_smear_version_20.html The Muslim smear version 2.0] The Politico December 30, 2007.

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
The '''Data Quality Campaign''' (DQC) is a [[nonpartisan]], nonprofit [[advocacy organization]] s launched in 2005 to improve the quality, accessibility and use of data in education.&lt;ref name=Achieve&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Quality Campaign Launched at Data Summit|url=http://www.achieve.org/data-quality-campaign-launched-data-summit|publisher=Achieve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{Education in the U.S.}}
The Data Quality Campaign (DQC) was founded in 2005, by  Aimee Guidera and 10 founding partners as a national collaborative effort to encourage  states to improve the collection and use of high-quality education data, and implement state longitudinal data systems to measure student achievement.&lt;ref name=Achieve /&gt;&lt;ref name="DQC Aimee Guidera"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Team: Aimee Guidera|url=http://www.dataqualitycampaign.org/who-we-are/our-team/a-guidera|publisher=Data Quality Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focused on its 10 Essential Elements of Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems. During this time, the campaign was managed by the National Center for Educational Achievement (NCEA).&lt;ref name="NCEA About Us"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.nc4ea.org/about-us/|publisher=National Center for Education Achievement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2009, many states had implemented data systems but few were utilizing them to their full potential. The organization shifted  focus to its 10 State Actions to Ensure Effective Data Use. Around the same time, the NCEA was being acquired by [[ACT, Inc.]] in 2007, and the Data Quality Campaign became a fully independent nonprofit organization in 2011.&lt;ref name="Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Quality Campaign Welcomes New Chairman and Members to Board of Directors|url=http://www.dataqualitycampaign.org/node/815/|publisher=Data Quality Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Washington, DC based organization leads a partnership of nearly 100 organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet|url=http://www.dataqualitycampaign.org/files/DQC%20Fact%20Sheet%20May%202013.pdf|publisher=Data Quality Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Campaign Seeks to Dispel Common Core Data Mining Claims|url=http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/data-quality-campaign-attempts-dispel-common-core-data-mining-claims|publisher=Sunshine State News}}&lt;/ref&gt; I.&lt;ref name=Achieve /&gt;&lt;ref name="Who We Are"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who We Are|url=http://www.dataqualitycampaign.org/who-we-are/|publisher=Data Quality Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==10 Essential Elements==
When the Campaign was launched, part of its mission was to promote 10 essential elements of a longitudinal data system to  see a student's academic growth  and the contribution of specific programs .&lt;ref name=Achieve /&gt;

The elements are:&lt;ref name=Achieve /&gt;&lt;ref name="10 Essential Elements"&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Essential Elements|url=http://www.dataqualitycampaign.org/your-states-progress/10-essential-elements/|publisher=Data Quality Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Every Child Prepared"&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Essential Elements Critical  to Longitudinal Data Systems:  How California Stacks Up|url=http://www.everychildprepared.org/docs/appendixj.pdf|publisher=Every Child Prepared}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ohio Department of Education"&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Quality Campaign’s Ten Essential Elements and State Actions|url=http://www.ode.state.or.us/superintendent/priorities/dqc---10-essential-elements-and-actions.pdf|publisher=Ohio Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
1. Student Identifier: A unique statewide student identifier that connects student data across key databases  across years &lt;br /&gt;
2. Student Info: Student-level enrollment, demographic, and program participation information &lt;br /&gt;
3. Matching Student Test Records: The ability to match individual students' test records from year to year t &lt;br /&gt;
4. Untested Student Info: Information on untested students and the reasons they were not tested &lt;br /&gt;
5. Teacher/Student Data Link: A teacher identifier system with the ability to match teachers to students &lt;br /&gt;
6. Transcript Data: Student-level transcript information, including information on courses completed and grades earned &lt;br /&gt;
7. College Readiness Scores: Student-level college readiness test scores &lt;br /&gt;
8. Graduation/Dropout Data: Student-level graduation and dropout data &lt;br /&gt;
9. P-12/Postsecondary Records Match: The ability to match student records between K-12 and higher education systems &lt;br /&gt;
10. Data Audit System: A state data audit system assessing data quality, validity, and reliability

The DQC continued to promote and monitor states' progress in establishing these elements until 2011. In September 2009, all 50 states agreed to implement the 12 America COMPETES Elements, which include DQC's 10  elements and today, states report that information to the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]].

==10 State Actions==
QC has identified 10 state actions to help ensure that states use theinformation. Every year since 2010, it surveys states' progress through the Data for Action survey.&lt;ref name="10 State Actions"&gt;{{cite web|title=10 State Actions|url=http://www.dataqualitycampaign.org/your-states-progress/10-state-actions/|publisher=Data Quality Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New American Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Many Missing Pieces|url=http://www.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/NAF_ManyMissingPieces.pdf|publisher=New American Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actions are:&lt;ref name="Ohio Department of Education" /&gt;&lt;ref name="10 State Actions"/&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
1. Link Data Systems: Link State K-12 data systems with early learning, postsecondary education, workforce, social services, and other agencies(currently in development) &lt;br /&gt;
2. Sustained Support: Create stable, sustained support for robust state longitudinal data systems
(not yet achieved)&lt;br /&gt;
3. Governance Structures: Develop governance structures to guide data collection, sharing, and use &lt;br /&gt;
4. Data Repositories: Build state data repositories (e.g. data warehouses) that integrate student, staff, financial, and facility data&lt;br /&gt;
5. Timely Access to Data: Implement systems to provide all stakeholders with timely access to the information they need while protecting student privacy&lt;br /&gt;
6. Individual Progress Reports: Create progress reports with individual student data that provide information educators, parents and students can us to improve student performance &lt;br /&gt;
7. Aggregate Progress Reports: Create reports that include longitudinal statistics on school systems 
and groups of students to guide school-, district-, and state-level improvement efforts&lt;br /&gt;
8. Research Agenda: Develop a purposeful research agenda and collaborate with universities, 
researchers, and intermediary groups to explore the data for useful information (currently in 
development) &lt;br /&gt;
9. Professional Development: Implement policies and promote practices, including professional 
development and credentialing, to ensure educators know how to access, analyze, and use data 
appropriately (partially implemented – professional development is fully implemented; state not 
involved in credentialing process) &lt;br /&gt;
10. Raise Public Awareness: Promote strategies to raise awareness of available data and ensure that 
key stakeholders, including state policymakers, know how to access, analyze, and use the 
information

==Data for Action==
The Data for Action (DFA) is an annual survey of all 50 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico on their progress toward implementing DQC's 10 State Actions. Each year, DQC invites each state's Governor's office to participate in the survey and uses their responses to analyze which state actions have been implemented in each state. Beyond the 10 state actions, the DFA also includes questions on other data issues and attempts to identify best practices in the field.&lt;ref name="About Data for Action"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Data for Action|url=http://www.dataqualitycampaign.org/your-states-progress/about-data-for-action/|publisher=Data Quality Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DFA 2010===
In 2010, not all states had yet implemented all 10 Essential Elements, so the 2010 DFA also measured states' progress on those, as well as the 10 State Actions. The 2010 DFA results showed that 24 states had implemented all 10 Essential Elements but all states had committed to implement them by September 2011.&lt;ref name="Core Education"&gt;{{cite web|title=Data for Action 2010|url=http://www.coreeducationllc.com/blog2/data-for-action-2010/|publisher=Core Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the states had implemented all 10 State Actions and 17 states could not link student and teacher data, while 11 states could not link K-12 data to postsecondary data. Based on these results, DQC concluded that while states were making progress in data collection, they were not  using that data to improve student achievement, because the data  could not be linked across different education systems and was not  available to stakeholders . To combat these issues, DQC identified 5 state priorities for the upcoming year:/&gt;&lt;ref name="Center for Digital Education"&gt;{{cite web|title=Do States Use Data to Improve Student Learning?|url=http://www.centerdigitaled.com/policy/Do-States-Use-Data-to-Improve-Student-Learning.html|publisher=Center for Digital Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fulfill the 50-state commitment to implement the 10 Essential Elements by September 2011.
*Link K-12 with early childhood, postsecondary and workforce data to answer critical policy questions.
*Provide teachers, students and parents with access to longitudinal student-level data.
*Share data about teacher impact on student achievement with educator preparation institutions.
*Enact statewide preservice policies, including certification and licensure, and program approval, to build educator capacity to use data.&lt;ref name="Core Education"

===DFA 2011===
The results of the 2011 DFA revealed that states were still struggling with actually using the data that they collected. Most tellingly, the two State Actions that were most difficult for states to implement were Actions 5 and 9. Action 5 deals with making the data accessible to all stakeholder, including parents and teachers, while Action 9 deals with providing educators with the skills necessary to access the data and use it to help students.&lt;ref name="The Quick and the Ed"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Data Quality Campaign Report: The Hard Work Remains|url=http://www.quickanded.com/2011/12/new-data-quality-campaign-report-the-hard-work-remains.html|publisher=The Quick and the Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on its analysis of the 2011 DFA, DQC issued its "Game-Changing Priorities for States,"  to accelerate the implementation of the 10 State Actions. The priorities were:&lt;ref name="THE Journal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: 4 Keys to Educational Data Systems|url=http://thejournal.com/articles/2012/01/19/report-4-keys-to-educational-data-systems.aspx|publisher=THE Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Taking public input and identifying important policies that "will inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of the state’s data efforts"
# Among K-12, pre-K, higher education, and workforce data governance bodies, establishing "decision-making authority" for tackling issues of data use
# Reporting teacher effectiveness data to the schools that prepared them
# Continuing to address the needs of end users by determining whether existing tools are effective and fixing or refining them when they are not

===DFA 2012===

The results of the 2012 Data for Action survey revealed that only 10 states had implemented 8 or 9 of the 10 State Actions. While 35 states had the policies and funding to support a data system, only 5 made sure that it was accessible and usable for various stakeholders.&lt;ref name="District Administration"&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Access for Education Stakeholders|url=http://www.districtadministration.com/article/data-access-education-stakeholders|publisher=District Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the results, DQC determined that this may partly be due to the fact that while legislation may allow states to collect the data, it often makes it difficult for them to actually share the data with important stakeholders, like educators and parents. Based on these findings, DQC concluded that it is time to change the culture surrounding data use in education and get the data into the hands of people who need it most, like parents in teachers. To help, they issued five recommendations to guide states in 2013:&lt;ref name="THE Journal: DFA 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Time To Focus on Helping People Use Education Data|url=http://thejournal.com/Articles/2012/11/15/Time-To-Focus-on-Helping-People-Use-Education-Data-Says-Data-Quality-Campaign.aspx?Page=2|publisher=THE Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* To implement a high-quality teacher-student data link, including a statewide "teacher of record" definition, a roster verification system, and the ability to link multiple educators per student per course.
* To develop a feedback loop to share teacher performance data with teacher preparation programs.
* To provide educators with access to timely data they can use to  personalize instruction and push their own professional development.
* To focus professional development on helping teachers use data effectively.
* To develop teacher licensing and program approval policies that include having instructors prove they possess data literacy.

==Advocacy==
DQC spoke out in favor of the [[Strengthening Education through Research Act (H.R. 4366; 113th Congress)]], a bill to amend and [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] the [[Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002]] and  authorize the [[appropriations bill (United States)|appropriation]] of $615 million for fiscal year 2015 and $3.8 billion over the 2015-2019 period to support federal educational research, statistical analysis, and other activities.&lt;ref name=cbo4366&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4366|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45300|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dataquality1&gt;{{cite web|last=Yochum|first=Kristin|title=Strengthening Education through Research Act plans to modernize SLDS program|url=http://www.dataqualitycampaign.org/blog/2014/04/strengthening-education-through-research-act/|publisher=Data Quality Campaign|accessdate=7 May 2014|date=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14147">'''Digital infinity''' is a technical term in [[theoretical linguistics]]. Alternative formulations are "discrete infinity" and "the infinite use of finite means". The idea is that all human languages follow a simple logical principle, according to which a limited set of digits—irreducible atomic sound elements—are combined to produce an infinite range of potentially meaningful expressions. 

[[Image:Galileos Dialogue Title Page.png|thumb|300px|right|Frontispiece and title page of the ''Dialogue'']]{{quotation|'Language is, at its core, a system that is both digital and infinite. To my knowledge, there is no other biological system with these properties....'|{{Citation|title=''Noam Chomsky''}}&lt;ref name="NoamChomsky"&gt;Noam Chomsky, 1991. Linguistics and Cognitive Science: Problems and Mysteries. in Asa Kasher (ed.), ''The Chomskyan Turn.'' Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 26-53, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quotation|‘It remains for us to examine the spiritual element of speech ... this marvelous invention of composing from twenty-five or thirty sounds an infinite variety of words, which, although not having any resemblance in themselves to that which passes through our minds, nevertheless do not fail to reveal to others all of the secrets of the mind, and to make intelligible to others who cannot penetrate into the mind all that we conceive and all of the diverse movements of our souls.’|{{Citation|title=''[[Antoine Arnauld]] and Claude Lancelot''}}&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Arnauld and Claude Lancelot, 1975 (1660). ''The Port-Royal Grammar.'' The Hague: Mouton, pp. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Noam Chomsky]] cites [[Galileo]] as perhaps the first to recognise the significance of digital infinity. This principle, notes Chomsky, is "the core property of human language, and one of its most distinctive properties: the use of finite means to express an unlimited array of thoughts". In his ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogo]]'', Galileo describes with wonder the discovery of a means to communicate one's "most secret thoughts to any other person ... with no greater difficulty than the various collocations of twenty-four little characters upon a paper." This is the greatest of all human inventions, Galileo continues, comparable to the creations of a Michelangelo...&lt;ref name="NoamChomsky" /&gt;

== The computational theory of mind ==
'Digital infinity' corresponds to Noam Chomsky's '[[universal grammar]]' mechanism, conceived as a computational [[Language module|module]] inserted somehow into ''Homo sapiens''{{'}} otherwise 'messy' (non-digital) brain. This conception of human cognition—central to the so-called '[[cognitive revolution]]' of the 1950s and 1960s—is generally attributed to [[Alan Turing]], who was the first scientist to argue that a man-made machine might truly be said to 'think'. The idea of a thinking machine had previously been considered absurd, having been famously dismissed by [[René Descartes]] as ''theoretically'' impossible. Neither animals nor machines can think, insisted Descartes, since they lack a God-given soul.&lt;ref&gt;Rene Descartes, 1985 [1637]. 'Discourse on the Method.' In ''The Philosophical Writings of Descartes.'' Translated by J. Cottingham, R. Stoothoff and D. Murdoch. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, Vol. 1, pp. 139-141. &lt;/ref&gt; Turing was well aware of this traditional theological objection, and explicitly countered it.&lt;ref name="Turing"&gt;Alan Turing, 1950. [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]. ''Mind'' 59: 433-60.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today's digital computers are instantiations of Turing's theoretical breakthrough in conceiving the possibility of a man-made ''universal thinking machine''—known nowadays as a '[[Turing machine]]'. No physical mechanism can be intrinsically 'digital', Turing explained, since—examined closely enough—its possible states will vary without limit. But if most of these states can be profitably ignored, leaving only a limited set of relevant distinctions, then ''functionally'' the machine may be considered 'digital':&lt;ref name="Turing"/&gt; {{quotation|'The digital computers considered in the last section may be classified amongst the "discrete-state machines." These are the machines which move by sudden jumps or clicks from one quite definite state to another. These states are sufficiently different for the possibility of confusion between them to be ignored. Strictly speaking, there are no such machines. Everything really moves continuously. But there are many kinds of machine which can profitably be thought of as being discrete-state machines. For instance in considering the switches for a lighting system it is a convenient fiction that each switch must be definitely on or definitely off. There must be intermediate positions, but for most purposes we can forget about them.' |{{Citation|title=''Alan Turing''}}&lt;ref name="Alan Turing"&gt;Alan Turing, 1950. [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]. ''Mind'' 59: 433-60&lt;/ref&gt;}}
An implication is that 'digits' don't exist: they and their combinations are no more than convenient fictions, operating on a level quite independent of the material, physical world. In the case of a ''binary'' digital machine, the choice at each point is restricted to 'off' versus 'on'. Crucially, the intrinsic properties of the [[Media (communication)|medium]] used to encode signals then have no effect on the message conveyed. 'Off' (or alternatively 'on') remains unchanged regardless of whether the signal consists of smoke, electricity, sound, light or anything else. In the case of analog (more-versus-less) gradations, this is not so because the range of possible settings is unlimited. Moreover, in the analog case it ''does'' matter which particular medium is being employed: equating a certain intensity of smoke with a corresponding intensity of light, sound or electricity is just not possible. In other words, only in the case of ''digital'' computation and communication can information be truly independent of the physical, chemical or other properties of the materials used to encode and transmit messages.

Digital computation and communication operates, then, independently of the physical properties of the computing machine. As scientists and philosophers during the 1950s digested the implications, they exploited the insight to explain why 'mind' apparently operates on so different a level from 'matter'. Descartes celebrated distinction between immortal 'soul' and mortal 'body' was conceptualised, following Turing, as no more than the distinction between (digitally encoded) ''information'' on the one hand, and, on the other, the particular physical ''medium''—light, sound, electricity or whatever—chosen to transmit the corresponding signals. Note that the Cartesian assumption of mind's independence of matter implied—in the human case at least—the existence of some kind of digital computer operating inside the human brain. 

{{quotation|'Information and computation reside in patterns of data and in relations of logic that are independent of the physical medium that carries them. When you telephone your mother in another city, the message stays the same as it goes from your lips to her ears even as it physically changes its form, from vibrating air, to electricity in a wire, to charges in silicon, to flickering light in a fibre optic cable, to electromagnetic waves, and then back again in reverse order. ... Likewise, a given programme can run on computers made of vacuum tubes, electromagnetic switches, transistors, integrated circuits, or well-trained pigeons, and it accomplishes the same things for the same reasons.

This insight, first expressed by the mathematician Alan Turing, the computer scientists Alan Newell, Herbert Simon, and Marvin Minsky, and the philosophers Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor, is now called the [[computational theory of mind]]. It is one of the great ideas in intellectual history, for it solves one of the puzzles that make up the 'mind-body problem', how to connect the ethereal world of meaning and intention, the stuff of our mental lives, with a physical hunk of matter like the brain. ... For millennia this has been a paradox. ... The computational theory of mind resolves the paradox.'|{{Citation|title=''Steven Pinker''}}&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, 1997. ''How the Mind Works.'' London: Allen Lane, Penguin, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==A digital apparatus==
Turing did not claim that the human mind really is a digital computer. More modestly, he proposed that digital computers might one day qualify in human eyes as machines endowed with "mind". However, it was not long before philosophers (most notably [[Hilary Putnam]]) took what seemed to be the next logical step—arguing that the human mind ''itself'' is a digital computer, or at least that certain mental "modules" are best understood that way.

[[Noam Chomsky]] rose to prominence as one of the most audacious champions of this 'cognitive revolution'. Language, he proposed, is a computational 'module' or 'device' unique to the human brain. Previously, linguists had thought of language as learned cultural behaviour: chaotically variable, inseparable from social life and therefore beyond the remit of natural science. The Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], for example, had defined linguistics as a branch of 'semiotics', this in turn being inseparable from anthropology, sociology and the study of man-made conventions and institutions. By picturing language instead as the ''natural'' mechanism of 'digital infinity', Chomsky promised to bring scientific rigour to linguistics as a branch of strictly ''natural'' science.

[[Image:Sagittalmouth.png|thumb|300px|right|The human speech apparatus in sagittal section]]In the 1950s, phonology was generally considered the most rigorously scientific branch of linguistics. For phonologists, "digital infinity" was made possible by the human vocal apparatus conceptualised as a kind of machine consisting of a small number of binary switches. For example, "voicing" could be switched 'on' or 'off', as could palatisation, nasalisation and so forth. Take the consonant [b], for example, and switch voicing to the 'off' position—and you get [p]. Every possible phoneme in any of the world's languages might in this way be generated by specifying a particular on/off configuration of the switches ('articulators') constituting the human vocal apparatus. This approach became celebrated as '[[distinctive features]]' theory, in large part credited to the Russian linguist and polymath [[Roman Jakobson]]. The basic idea was that every phoneme in every natural language could in principle be reduced to its irreducible atomic components—a set of 'on' or 'off' choices ('distinctive features') allowed by the design of a digital apparatus consisting of the human tongue, soft palate, lips, larynx and so forth. 

Chomsky's original work was in [[Morphophonology|morphophonemics]]. During the 1950s, he became inspired by the prospect of extending Roman Jakobson's 'distinctive features' approach—now hugely successful—far beyond its original field of application. Jakobson had already persuaded a young social anthropologist—[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]—to apply distinctive features theory to the study of kinship systems, in this way inaugurating 'structural anthropology'. Chomsky—who got his job at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology thanks to the intervention of Jakobson and his student, Morris Halle—hoped to explore the extent to which similar principles might be applied to the various sub-disciplines of linguistics, including syntax and semantics.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1965. ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, pp. 64-127.&lt;/ref&gt; If the phonological component of language was demonstrably rooted in a digital biological 'organ' or 'device', why not the syntactic and semantic components as well? Might not language as a whole prove to be a digital organ or device?

This led some of Chomsky's early students to the idea of '[[generative semantics]]'—the proposal that the speaker generates word and sentence meanings by combining irreducible constituent elements of meaning, each of which can be switched 'on' or 'off'. To produce 'bachelor', using this logic, the relevant component of the brain must switch 'animate', 'human' and 'male' to the 'on' '''(+)''' position while keeping 'married' switched 'off' '''(-)'''. The underlying assumption here is that the requisite conceptual primitives—irreducible notions such as 'animate', 'male', 'human', 'married' and so forth—are genetically determined internal components of the human language organ. While this idea would rapidly encounter intellectual difficulties—sparking controversies culminating in the so-called '[[linguistics wars]]'&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R. A. 1993. ''The Linguistics Wars.'' New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;—it attracted young and ambitious scholars impressed by the recent emergence of computer science and its promise of scientific parsimony and unification. If the theory worked, the simple principle of digital infinity would apply to language as a whole. Linguistics in its entirety might then lay claim to the coveted status of ''natural'' science. No part of the discipline—not even semantics—need be contaminated any longer by association with such 'un-scientific' disciplines as cultural anthropology or social science.

'''Dividing territories''' (also '''market division''') is an agreement by two companies to stay out of each other's way and reduce competition in the agreed-upon territories. The process known as geographic market allocation is one of several [[anti-competitive practices]] outlawed under [[United States antitrust law]]s. The term is generally understood to include dividing customers as well.

For example, in 1984, [[FMC Corp.]] and Asahi Chemical agreed to divide territories for the sale of [[microcrystalline cellulose]], and later FMC attempted to eliminate all vestiges of competition by inviting smaller rivals also to collude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2000/12/fmc.htm|title=FTC Order Settles Charges that FMC Corp. and Japan's Asahi Chemical Co.

'''EUREF Permanent Network''' ('''EPN''') is a [[Europe]]an Network of more than 300 continuously operating [[GNSS]] reference stations with precisely known [[coordinate]]s referenced to the [[European Terrestrial Reference System 1989|ETRS89]]. '''EPN''' is the key instrument in the maintenance of [[European Terrestrial Reference System 1989|ETRS89]] [[geodetic datum]]. The EPN stations collect continuously the observation data from high accuracy multi-[[GNSS]] [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]s. The data is processed in the centralized way in a few data processing centres. '''EPN''' is created and maintained by a voluntary agreement of about 100 European agencies and universities. '''EPN''' activities are coordinated by [[Regional Reference Frame Sub-Commission for Europe|EUREF]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Bruyninx, M. Becker and G. Stangl. Regional Densification of the IGS in Europe Using the EUREF Permanent GPS Network, Phys. Chem. Earth, ''' 26''', No 6-8, 2001, pp.531-538&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Bruyninx.

Monitoring of the EPN Coordinate Time Series for Improved Reference Frame Maintenance", GPS solutions, '''8''', 4, 2004, pp. 200-209.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The '''EPN''' consists of the following components:

*''Tracking Stations'' include [[GNSS]] tracking [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]s and [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]e on suitable geodetic markers.
*''Operational Centres'' perform data validation, conversion of raw data to the [[RINEX]] format, data compression, and upload to ''Local Data Centres''.
*''Local Data Centres'' store the data of ''Tracking Stations'' and disseminate them via the [[Internet]].
*''Local Analysis Centres'' process a subnetwork of '''EPN''' stations and deliver weekly subnetwork  solutions to ''Combination Centres''.
*''Combination Centres'' combine subnetwork solutions into one official '''EPN''' solution, which is weekly sent to the [[Inertial guidance system|IGS]] for the integration in the global [[GNSS]] network solution.
*''Central Bureau'' manages day-to-day the activities of '''EPN'''. It is located at the [[Royal Observatory of Belgium]] in [[Brussels]].

==Data and products==
'''EPN''' ''data'' are raw multi-[[GNSS]] pseudorange and phase observations, broadcast ephemerides, and supporting types of raw data (such as meteorological) as they are gathered by the ''Tracking Stations''. The '''EPN''' ''data'' is available in daily, hourly, 15-min [[RINEX]]-formatted files, and for many stations as a real-time data stream via [[Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol|NTRIP]].

'''EPN''' ''products'' include
*best-known [[coordinate]]s of the ''Tracking Stations'' in both [[ETRS89]] and [[International Terrestrial Reference System|ITRS]] [[geodetic datum]]s;
*time series of the [[coordinate]]s of the ''Tracking Stations'';
*tropospheric zenith path delays at all the ''Tracking Stations''.

'''Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham''' (born 1945) is a professor of [[African-American studies|Afro-American Studies]], African American Religion and the Victor S. Thomas Professor of History and African American Studies at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="The History Makers" /&gt; Higginbotham wrote ''Righteous Discontent: The Women's Movement in the Black Baptist Church: 1880-1920'', which won several awards. She has also received several awards for her work, most notably the 2014 [[National Humanities Medal]].

==Early life and education==
Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham was born in 1945 to Albert Neal Sow Brooks and his wife Alma Elaine Campbell.&lt;ref name="The History Makers" /&gt; Higginbotham's father served as secretary treasurer for the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History as well as edited the organization's ''Negro History Bulletin''. Her mother, Alma Elaine Campbell, a high school history teacher, later became the supervisor for history in the Washington, D.C. public school system.&lt;ref name="The History Makers"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Higginbotham|first1=Evelyn|title=Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham|url=http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/evelyn-brooks-higginbotham|website=The History Makers|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higginbotham often accompanied her father to his work, which allowed her to encounter and become familiar with many significant early African American historians, including [[Rayford Logan]], [[Charles H. Wesley]] and [[Benjamin Quarles]]. Higginbotham later related how this unique experience shaped her later career choice, “I knew from childhood that I wanted to teach, research, and write about the history of African Americans."&lt;ref name="Humanities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/about/awards/national-humanities-medals/evelyn-brooks-higginbotham|title=Awards &amp; Honors: 2014 National Humanities Medalist Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham|website=National Endowment for the Humanities|last1=Williams|first1=Chad|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories her father told her of her family members also inspired her. Her great-grandfather, Albert Royal Brooks, was born a slave in Virginia in 1817, and after the [[American Civil War]] then began to serve on the jury to try former Confederate president [[Jefferson Davis]].&lt;ref name="AFRO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afro.com/evelyn-b-higginbotham-african-american-historian-honored-with-white-house-medal/|title=Evelyn B. Higginbotham, African American Historian Honored with White House Medal|website=AFRO|last1=Snowden-McCray|first1=Lisa|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higginbotham's great-grandmother, Lucy Goode Brooks, created one of the first post-Civil War orphanages serving black children. Her grandfather, Walter Henderson Brooks, was a pastor at Nineteenth St. Baptist Church which is one of the oldest black Baptist congregations in Washington D.C. Higginbotham's aunt, Julia Evangeline Brooks, was one of the incorporators of [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], the first African-American sorority.&lt;ref name="Humanities" /&gt;

“In many ways,” Higginbotham says, “the family stories inspired me to pursue the discipline of history and gave me an appreciation of the importance of individual lives, broadly speaking, as a lens or mirror to much larger social and political contexts.”&lt;ref name="Humanities" /&gt;

In 1969, Higginbotham received her B.A. history degree from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]], then in 1974 went on to receive her M.A. history degree from Howard University.&lt;ref name="The History Makers" /&gt; In 1975 she earned a certification in Archival Administration and Record Management from the U.S. National Archives.&lt;ref name="The History Makers" /&gt; In 1977 she earned a certification in quantitative methodology in Social Science from the [[Newberry Library]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name="The History Makers" /&gt; In 1984 she received her Ph.D. degree in history from the [[University of Rochester]].&lt;ref name="The History Makers" /&gt; She also married [[A. Leon Higginbotham]].

==Career==
Higginbothan taught American history and counseled students completing the eighth grade at Francis Parkman Jr. High School in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] from 1969 to 1971.&lt;ref name="The History Makers" /&gt; After she moved to Washington D.C., she taught American history and social studies at [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Washington, D.C.)|Woodrow Wilson High School]].&lt;ref name="The History Makers" /&gt; From 1974 to 1975 she worked as a manuscript research associate at [[Moorland-Spingarn Research Center]] at [[Howard University]].&lt;ref name="The History Makers" /&gt; Higginbotham also taught history as a professor at [[Dartmouth College]], the [[University of Maryland]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="The History Makers" /&gt;

In 1993, Higginbothan became a professor of Afro-American Studies and African American Religious History at [[Harvard University]] where she still currently works today.&lt;ref name="The History Makers" /&gt; In 1990 she was named the Victor S. Thomas Professor of History and African American Studies.&lt;ref name="The History Makers" /&gt; Higginbotham became the chair of Harvard University's African American Studies department in 2006 and served as acting-director of the [[W. E. B. Du Bois Institute|W.E.B Du Bois Institute for African American Research]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="The History Makers" /&gt; Higginbotham was also appointed as the Inaugural [[John Hope Franklin]] Professor of American Legal History at [[Duke University]] Law School.&lt;ref name="The History Makers" /&gt;

==Publications and work==
Higginbotham's writing spans a variety of diverse topics which include African American religious history, women's history, civil rights, constructions of racial and gender  identity, electoral politics and the combination and intersection of theory and history.

Higginbotham's most notable piece of work is her book ''Righteous Discontent: The Women's Movement in the Black Baptist Church: 1880–1920.'' This book won numerous awards including awards from the [[American Historical Association]], the [[American Academy of Religion]]], the Association of Black Women Historians and the Association for Research on Non-Profit and Voluntary Organizations. ''Righteous Discontent: The Women's Movement in the Black Baptist Church: 1880-1920'' was also on the New York Times Book Review's Notable Books of the Year in both 1993 and 1992.&lt;ref name="Howard University The Legacy..." /&gt;

Higginbotham has also revised and re-written ''African American history survey From Slavery to Freedom'', which was originally published in 1947 by John Hope Franklin. She has worked with Henry Louis Gates, Jr. as a co-editor of the African American National Biography which is a twelve-volume resource of information that presents African American history in over 5,000 biographical entries.&lt;ref name="Harvard History Dept." /&gt; Her article ''"African American Women's History and the Metalanguage of Race,"'' won the best article prize of the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians in 1993 and continues to be one of her most cited and reprinted articles.&lt;ref name="Howard University The Legacy..." /&gt;

Higginbotham has won numerous awards throughout the years for her books, publications and research. In 1994 she received the Scholar's Medal of the University of Rochester. In 2000 she was awarded the [[YWCA Boston|YWCA of Boston]]'s Women of Achievement Award.&lt;ref name="Howard University The Legacy..."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Higginbotham|first1=Evelyn|title=DR.

'''Fiesole''' ({{IPA-it|ˈfjɛːzole}}) is a town and ''[[comune]]'' of the [[Metropolitan City of Florence]] in the [[Italy|Italian]] region of [[Tuscany]], on a scenic height above [[Florence]], 5 km (3 miles) northeast of that city. Both [[Harvard University]] and [[Georgetown University]] have their centers of Italian Renaissance Studies domiciled in Fiesole.&lt;ref&gt;http://itatti.harvard.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://villalebalze.georgetown.edu&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Decameron]] by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] is set in the slopes of Fiesole. The city was equally featured in the novels [[Peter Camenzind ]] (1904) by [[Hermann Hesse]] and [[A Room with a View]] (1908) by [[E. M. Forster]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/travel/30Florence.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 14th century the city has always been considered a getaway for the [[upper class]] of Florence and up to this day Fiesole remains noted for its very expensive residential properties. The city is generally considered to be the wealthiest and most affluent suburb of Florence. In 2016 the city had the highest median family income in the whole of Tuscany.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infodata.ilsole24ore.com/2016/08/04/dove-vivono-i-piu-ricchi-ditalia-la-classifica-dei-comuni-con-i-redditi-piu-alti-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Fiesole ([[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] '''Viesul''', '''Viśl''', '''Vipsul''') was probably founded in the 9th{{endash}}8th century BC, as it was an important member of the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] confederacy, as may be seen from the remains of its ancient walls.

The first recorded mention of the town dates to 283 BC, when the town, then known as '''Faesulae''', was conquered by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]]. In pagan antiquity it was the seat of a famous school of [[augurs]], and every year twelve young men were sent thither from Rome to study the art of divination. [[Sulla]] colonized it with veterans, who afterwards, under the leadership of Gaius Mallius, supported the cause of [[Catilina]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'', [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], Editor.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaius Mallius was a colonist of Fiesole who, according to [[Sallust]] (''[[Bellum Catilinae]]'' 24.2), was the first to raise an army and take the field against Rome.  His ''nomen'' is often confused with the more common ''Manlius''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiesole was the scene of [[Stilicho]]'s great victory over the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] hordes of the [[Vandals]] and [[Suebi]] under [[Radagaisus]] in 406.&lt;ref&gt;Radagaisus was executed 23 August 406 (Herwig Wolfram, Thomas J. Dunlap, tr., ''History of the Goths'', 1988:169); [[Paulinus of Nola]] attributed the victory of Stilicho  over Radagaisus's Ostrogoths near Fiesole, to the protection of Felix, Peter, Paul and other saints.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]] (536–553) the town was several times besieged. In 539 [[Justin (general under Justinian I)|Justin]], the Byzantine general, captured it and razed its fortifications.

It was an independent town for several centuries in the early Middle Ages, no less powerful than Florence in the valley below, and many wars arose between them; in 1010 and 1025 Fiesole was sacked by the Florentines, before it was conquered by Florence in 1125, and its leading families obliged to take up their residence in Florence. Dante reflects this rivalry in his ''Divine Comedy'' by referring to "the beasts of Fiesole." (Inferno XV.73).&lt;ref&gt;Dante in Love, A.N. Wilson, p. 71 (Farrar, Straus and Giroux: 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 14th century, rich Florentines had countryside villas in Fiesole, and one of them is the setting of the [[frame narrative]] of the [[Decameron]]. [[Boccaccio]]'s poem ''Il Ninfale fiesolano'' is a mythological account of the origins of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Nocita |first=Teresa |editor=Italo Pantani |encyclopedia=Pathways through Literature |title=Giovanni Boccaccio: Tuscan mythologies |url=http://www.internetculturale.it/opencms/opencms/directories/ViaggiNelTesto/boccaccio/eng/b21.html |accessdate=2012-01-12 |publisher=Internet Culturale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Browning mentions “sober pleasant Fiesole” several times in his poem [[Andrea del Sarto (poem)|"Andrea Del Sarto"]].

The [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], since 1992, has shadowed and recorded the top four hundred people who make the most [[gross income]], and they are call the Fortunate 400.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://taxfoundation.org/article/fortunate-400|title=The Fortunate 400|website=Tax Foundation|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
The Fortunate 400 are basically the richest people in the [[United States]]. In 1992, when the IRS starting tracking the people who make the most money, the 400th richest person in America made $24 million. Then In 2007, the 400th [[The World's Billionaires|richest human]] produced $138 million (or $87 million, inflation-adjusted).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/07/how-the-richest-400-people-in-america-got-so-rich/259520/|title=How the Richest 400 People in America Got So Rich|last=Thompson|first=Derek|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These riches have come from [[capital gain]], and the rich keep making more money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/07/how-the-richest-400-people-in-america-got-so-rich/259520/|title=How the Richest 400 People in America Got So Rich|last=Thompson|first=Derek|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a constant question and debate in politics whether or not the rich need more tax cuts or need to pay more [[Taxation in the United States|taxes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalmemo.com/david-cay-johnston-the-fortunate-400/|title=David Cay Johnston: The Fortunate 400 - The National Memo - Smart.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1708">'''Geojurisprudence''' is "a [[system]]ic approach to the connections of [[legal science]] to [[geography]] and [[geopolitics]]" ([[Manfred Langhans-Ratzeburg]] - ''Begriff und Aufgaben der Geographischen Rechtswissenshaft (Geojurisprudenz)'' published by Kurt Vowinkel in 1928 as a companion volume to [[Karl Haushofer]]'s ''Zeitschrift für Geopolitik'' (ZfG).

Haushofer opened the topic in his essay "Geopolitik und Geojurisprudenz" which appeared in ''Zeitschrift für Völkerrecht'' in 1928. Here he lamented the lack of geographical understanding in [[Germany|German]] legal studies. 

He said this contributed towards the general failure of the German populace to understand the nature of the [[First World War]]. He heralded Langhans-Ratzeburg as the chief representative of this new discipline, which he suggested would overcome the "thin, sterile air of legal scientific concepts and the fraudulent, political scientific, treaty-waving political posture of the so-called central powers". 

With a return to putatively "German" concepts of legal relations between states, invigorated by incorporating a geographical perspective, then borders as durable legal structures rooted in geography would emerge.

With this introduction, ''Langhans-Ratzeburg'' in turn praised not only Haushofer, but also [[Alfred Hettner]], [[Walther Vogel]] and [[Albert von Hoffmann]] for their attempts to link geography, history, politics and culture.

{{History of the United States}}
The '''history of unfree labor in the United States''' encompasses to all forms of [[unfree labor]] which have occurred within the present day borders of the [[United States]] through modern times. "Unfree labor" is a generic or collective term for those work relations, in which people are employed against their will by the threat of [[poverty|destitution]], [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]], [[violence]] (including death), lawful [[wiktionary:compulsion|compulsion]], or other extreme hardship to themselves or to members of their families.

Many Native American tribes practiced some form of slavery before the European introduction of [[Atlantic slave trade|African slavery]] into North America; but none exploited slave labor on a large scale.&lt;ref name="amslav"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_indians_slavery.htm|title=Slavery and Native Americans in British North America and the United States: 1600 to 1865|author= Tony Seybert|accessdate=14 June 2011 |year=4 Aug 2004 |publisher=Slavery in America|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040804001522/http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_indians_slavery.htm|archivedate= 4 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The arrival of the Europeans ushered in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], where Africans were sold into [[chattel slavery]] into the American continent. It lasted from the 15th through 19th centuries and was the largest legal form of unfree labor in the history of the United States, reaching 4 million slaves at its height.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Slavery and involuntary servitude were made illegal through the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|thirteenth amendment]], except as punishment for a crime.&lt;ref name="quote"&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/slurp_file.php?fileref=10 Charters of Freedom – The Declaration of Independence, The Constitution, The Bill of Rights]
{{quote|'''Section 1.''' Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.

'''Section 2.''' Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.|''Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution''|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, unfree labor still existed legally in the form of the [[peonage]] system, especially in the New Mexico territories, [[debt bondage]], [[penal labor]] and [[convict lease|convict leasing]], and [[debt bondage]] such as the [[truck system]], as well as many illegal forms of unfree labor, particularly [[sexual slavery]].

Labor reforms in the 19th and 20th eventually outlawed many of these forms of labors.  However, illegal unfree labor in the form of [[human trafficking]] continued to grow, and the economy continued to rely on unfree labor from abroad.  Starting at the end of the 20th century, there became an increased public awareness of human trafficking.  More anti-human trafficking groups began to form and anti-human trafficking laws began to be passed, though the extent of the laws and the implementation varies widely from state to state.  The U.S. Justice Department estimates that 17,500 people are trafficked into the country every year, but the true figure could be higher, because of the large numbers of undocumented immigrants. Those being trafficked include young children, teenagers, men and women and can be domestic citizens or foreign nationals. According to the Department of State's statistics from 2000, there are approximately 244,000 American children and youth that are at risk for sex trafficking each year. Of these children and youth, 38,600 were originally runaways.

Native American groups often enslaved [[Prisoners of war|war captives]] whom they primarily used for small-scale labor.&lt;ref name="amslav"/&gt; Some, however, were used in ritual sacrifice.&lt;ref name="amslav"/&gt;  While little is known, there is little evidence that the slaveholders considered the slaves as racially inferior; they came from other Native American tribes and were casualties of war.&lt;ref name="amslav"/&gt; Native Americans did not buy and sell captives in the pre-colonial era, although they sometimes exchanged enslaved individuals with other tribes in peace gestures or in exchange for redeeming their own members.&lt;ref name="amslav"/&gt; The word "slave" may not accurately apply to such captive people.&lt;ref name="amslav"/&gt;  Most of these so-called Native American slaves tended to live on the fringes of Native American society and were slowly integrated into the tribe.&lt;ref name="amslav"/&gt;

In many cases, new tribes adopted captives to replace warriors killed during a raid.&lt;ref name="amslav"/&gt; Warrior captives were sometimes made to undergo ritual mutilation or torture that could end in death as part of a grief ritual for relatives slain in battle.&lt;ref name="amslav"/&gt;  Some Native Americans would cut off one foot of captives to keep them from running away. Others allowed enslaved male captives to marry the widows of slain husbands.&lt;ref name="amslav"/&gt;  The [[Muscogee|Creek]], who engaged in this practice and had a [[matrilineal]] system, treated children born of slaves and Creek women as full members of their mothers' clans and of the tribe, as property and hereditary leadership passed through the maternal line. The children did not have slave status.&lt;ref name="amslav"/&gt; More typically, tribes took women and children for captives for adoption, as they tended to adapt more easily into new ways.

Several tribes held captives as hostages for payment.&lt;ref name="amslav"/&gt; Various tribes also practiced debt slavery or imposed slavery on tribal members who had committed crimes; full tribal status would be restored as the enslaved worked off their obligations to the tribal society.&lt;ref name="amslav"/&gt; Other slave-owning tribes of North America included the [[Comanche]] of Texas, the [[Creek tribe|Creek]] of Georgia; the fishing societies, such as the [[Yurok people|Yurok]], who lived in Northern California; the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]], and the [[Klamath people|Klamath]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24158 |title= Slavery in America|work=Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History |accessdate=October 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Europeans made contact with the Native Americans, they began to participate in the slave trade.&lt;ref name="bailey"&gt;{{cite web |title=Indian Slave Trade in the Southwest|author= Bailey, L.R.|accessdate=2010-05-29 |year=1966|publisher=Los Angeles, CA: Westernlore Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans, in their initial encounters with the Europeans, attempted to use their captives from enemy tribes as a “method of playing one tribe against another” in an unsuccessful game of divide and conquer.&lt;ref name="bailey"/&gt;

[[File:US Slave Free 1789-1861.gif|thumb|400px|An animation showing when United States territories and states forbade or allowed slavery, 1789–1861.]]
By the time of the [[American Revolution]] (1775–1783), the status of slave had been institutionalized as a racial caste associated with African ancestry. When the United States Constitution was ratified in 1789, a relatively small number of [[free people of color]] were among the voting citizens. During and immediately following the Revolutionary War, [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] laws were passed in most [[Northern United States|Northern states]] and a movement developed to abolish slavery. Most of these states had a higher proportion of free labor than in the South and economies based on different industries. They abolished slavery by the end of the 18th century, some with gradual systems that kept adults as slaves for two decades. But the rapid expansion of the [[King Cotton|cotton industry]] in the Deep South after the invention of the [[cotton gin]], greatly increased demand for slave labor, and the [[Southern United States|Southern states]] continued as slave societies. They attempted to extend slavery into the new Western territories in order to keep their share of political power in the nation; Southern leaders dreamed of annexing [[Cuba]] to be used as a slave territory. The United States was polarized over the issue of slavery, represented by the [[slave and free states]] divided by the [[Mason–Dixon line]], which separated free [[Pennsylvania]] from slave [[Maryland]] and [[Delaware]].

Congress under [[Thomas Jefferson]] prohibited the [[Atlantic slave trade|importation of slaves]], effective in 1808, but illegal smuggling took place.&lt;ref name="Julia Floyd Smith 1973, pp. 44-46"&gt;{{cite book |first=Julia Floyd |last=Smith |title=Slavery and Plantation Growth in Antebellum Florida, 1821–1860 |location=Gainesville |publisher=University of Florida Press |year=1973 |isbn=0-8130-0323-7 |pages=44–46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BKIDcAAACAAJ&amp;pg=PA44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic slave trading, however, continued at a rapid pace, driven by labor demands from the development of cotton [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] in the [[Deep South]]. More than one million slaves were sold from the Upper South, which had a surplus of labor, and taken to the Deep South in a forced migration, splitting up many families. New communities of African-American culture were developed in the Deep South, and the total slave population in the South eventually reached 4 million before liberation.&lt;ref name="Stephen1999"&gt;Stephen D. Behrendt, David Richardson, and David Eltis, [[W. E. B. Du Bois Institute|W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African-American Research]], [[Harvard University]].

As the West was developed for settlement, the Southern states wanted to keep a balance between the number of slave and free states, in order to maintain a political balance of power in [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The new [[Territories of the United States|territories]] acquired from [[British Empire|Britain]], [[French colonial empire|France]], and [[Mexico]] were the subject of major political compromises. By 1850, the newly rich cotton-growing South was threatening to secede from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], and tensions continued to rise. With Southern church ministers having adapted to supporting slavery, as modified by Christian paternalism, the largest denominations, the Baptist, Methodist and Presbyterian churches split over the issue into regional organizations of the North and South. When [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 election]] on a platform of no new slave states, the South broke away to form the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]; the first six states to secede held the greatest number of slaves in the South. This marked the start of the Civil War, which caused a huge disruption of the slave economy, with many slaves either escaping or being liberated by the Union armies. Due to Union measures such as the [[Confiscation Acts]] and [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in 1863, the war effectively ended slavery, even before ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] in December 1865 formally ended the legal institution throughout the United States.

== Other forms of legalized slavery ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
In spite of the issuance of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and the adoption of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the road to freedom remained elusive for most former slaves in the United States. While the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] is the supreme law of the land, it is not self-enforcing, nor was the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. The text and principles outlined in them were only words without enforcement, and so alone, they could not and did not abolish slavery. The enactment of the Thirteenth Amendment simply made slavery and all forms of involuntary servitude, except as punishment for crime, unconstitutional. The actual abolition of slavery – that is the full enforcement of the 13th Amendment took many decades beyond 1865 to be realized. Enforcement of the 13th amendment began during the Reconstruction period, but there were many setbacks between that time and full enforcement.

Proponents of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution knew that without legislation that codified the 13th Amendment in the form of laws and statutes along with law enforcement agencies to uphold the laws, there would be no true end to slavery, and this is the reason for the inclusion of Section 2 of the 13th Amendment authorizing Congress to establish laws upholding the amendment. The federal government also sent troops to the south to provide protection to the former slaves who were still living among their former captors.

During the [[Reconstruction era]] from January 1, 1863 to March 31, 1877, federal troops were stationed in the south specifically to keep blacks from being re-enslaved. However, in the [[Gilded Age]] that followed the [[Compromise of 1877|withdrawal]], blacks were left at the mercy of their former captors. When African Americans in the south no longer had the protection of the federal troops, whites found other ways to practice [[involuntary servitude]]

This lasted well into the 20th century, until President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] abolished [[Peon]]age in 1966, which rapidly decreased [[sharecropping]] in every [[Plantation complexes in the Southeastern United States|plantation]] nationwide. Although slavery is commonly understood to have ended with the Emancipation Proclamation, or the Thirteenth Amendment, exhaustive research conducted by journalist [[Douglas A. Blackmon]] and reported in his [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning book [[Slavery By Another Name]] shows that thousands of African Americans were re-enslaved with shocking force and brutality after the period of Reconstruction was over.

The continued involuntary servitude took various forms but the primary forms included [[Convict lease|convict leasing]], [[peon]]age, and [[sharecropping]], with the latter eventually encompassing poor whites as well and by the 1930s, they made up the vast majority. Using convict leasing programs, African American men, often guilty of no crime at all, were arrested, compelled to work without pay, repeatedly bought and sold, and coerced to do the bidding of masters. Sharecropping as it was practiced during this period often involved severe restrictions on the freedom of movement of sharecroppers who could be whipped for leaving the plantation. Both sharecropping and convict leasing were legal and tolerated by both the north and south. However, peonage was an illicit form of forced labor. Its existence was ignored by authorities while thousands of African Americans and poor Anglo Americans were subjugated and held in bondage until the mid 1960s to the late 1970s.

With the exception of cases of peonage, beyond the period of Reconstruction, the federal government took almost no action to enforce the 13th Amendment until December 1941 when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt summoned his attorney general. Five days after Pearl Harbor, at the request of the president Attorney General Francis Biddle issued [[wikisource:Circular No. 3591|Circular No. 3591]] to all federal prosecutors, instructing them to actively investigate and try any case of involuntary servitude or slavery. Several months later, convict leasing was officially abolished.

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], it was a serious question whether slavery had been permanently abolished or whether some form of semi-slavery would appear after the Union armies left. Over time a large [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954)|civil rights movement]] arose to bring full civil rights and equality under the law to all Americans.

===Black Codes===
{{Main|Black Codes (United States)}}
The Black Codes were laws passed by [[Southern United States|Southern states]] in 1865 and 1866, after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. These laws had the intent and the effect of restricting [[African American]]s' freedom, and of compelling them to work in a labor economy based on low wages or [[Debt bondage|debt]]. Black Codes were part of a larger pattern of Southern whites trying to suppress the new freedom of emancipated African American slaves, the [[freedmen]].

In the first two years after the Civil War, white dominated southern legislatures passed Black Codes modeled after the earlier slave codes. They were particularly concerned with controlling movement and labor, as slavery had given way to a free labor system. Although freedmen had been emancipated, their lives were greatly restricted by the black codes.

The term "Black Codes" was given by "negro leaders and the Republican organs", according to historian John S. Reynolds.&lt;ref&gt;James Calvin Hemphill, "John Schreiner Reynolds", ''Men of Mark in South Carolina: Ideals of American Life'' Vol. II; Washington, D.C.: Men of Mark Publishing Co., 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kermit L. Hall, "[http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Hall1.html Political Power and Constitutional Legitimacy: The South Carolina Ku Klux Klan Trials"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316201200/http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Hall1.html |date=2013-03-16 }}; ''Emory  Law Journal'' 33, Fall 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John S. Reynolds, ''[https://archive.org/details/cu31924028790208 Reconstruction in South Carolina]''; Columbia, SC: State Co., 1905; p. [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028790208#page/n37/mode/2up 27].&lt;/ref&gt; The defining feature of the Black Codes was broad [[Vagrancy (people)#Vagrancy under the law|vagrancy law]], which allowed local authorities to arrest freed people for minor infractions and commit them to involuntary labor.

====Convict leasing====
{{Main|Convict lease}}
[[File:Convicts Leased to Harvest Timber.png|thumb|Convicts leased to harvest timber circa 1915, in Florida]]
With emancipation a legal reality, white Southerners were concerned with both controlling the newly freed slaves and keeping them in the labor force at the lowest level. The system of [[convict lease|convict leasing]] began during Reconstruction and was fully implemented in the 1880s and officially ending in the last state, Alabama, in 1928. It persisted in various forms until it was abolished in 1942 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II, several months after the attack on Pearl Harbor involved the U.S. in the conflict. This system allowed private contractors to purchase the services of convicts from the state or local governments for a specific time period. African Americans, due to "vigorous and selective enforcement of laws and discriminatory sentencing", made up the vast majority of the convicts leased.&lt;ref&gt;Litwack (1998), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Douglas A. Blackmon writes of the system:

{{quote|It was a form of bondage distinctly different from that of the antebellum South in that for most men, and the relatively few women drawn in, this slavery did not last a lifetime and did not automatically extend from one generation to the next. But it was nonetheless slavery – a system in which armies of free men, guilty of no crimes and entitled by law to freedom, were compelled to labor without compensation, were repeatedly bought and sold, and were forced to do the bidding of white masters through the regular application of extraordinary physical coercion.&lt;ref&gt;Blackmon (2008), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The constitutional basis for convict leasing is that the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], while abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude generally, expressly [[Penal labor in the United States|permits it as a punishment for crime]].

=== Peonage ===
{{Main|Peon}}
Peonage is a type of involuntary servitude.  After the [[American Civil War]] of 1861–1865, peonage developed in the Southern United States. Poor white farmers and formerly enslaved African Americans known as [[freedmen]] who could not afford their own land would farm another person's land, exchanging labor for a share of the crops. This was called [[sharecropping]] and initially the benefits were mutual. The land owner would pay for the seeds and tools in exchange for a percentage of the money earned from the crop and a portion of the crop. As time passed, many landowners began to abuse this system. The landowner would force the tenant farmer or sharecropper to buy seeds and tools from the land owner’s store, which often had inflated prices. As sharecroppers were often illiterate, they had to depend on the books and accounting by the landowner and his staff. Other tactics included debiting expenses against the sharecropper's profits after the crop was harvested and "miscalculating" the net profit from the harvest, thereby keeping the sharecropper in perpetual debt to the landowner. Since the tenant farmers could not offset the costs, they were forced into involuntary labor due to the debts they owed the land owner.

After the U.S. Civil War, the South passed "[[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]]", laws that tried to control freed black slaves. [[Vagrancy (people)|Vagrancy]] laws were included in these Black Codes. Homeless or even unemployed African Americans who were between jobs, most of whom were former slaves were arrested and fined as vagrants. Usually lacking the resources to pay the fine, the "vagrant" was sent to county labor or hired out to a private employer. The authorities also tried to restrict the movement of freedmen between rural areas and cities, to between towns. Under such laws, local officials arbitrarily arrested tens of thousands of freedmen and charged them with fines and court costs of their cases. White merchants, farmers, and business owners could pay their debts and the prisoner had to work off the debt. Prisoners were leased as laborers to owners and operators of coal mines, lumber camps, brickyards, railroads, quarries, and farm plantations, with the revenues for their labor going to the states. Government officials leased imprisoned blacks and whites to small town entrepreneurs, provincial farmers, and dozens of corporations looking for cheap labor. Their labor was repeatedly bought and sold for decades after the official abolition of American slavery.&lt;ref name="Blackmon D"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackmon|first=Douglas|title=Slavery By Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black People in America from the Civil War to World War II|year=2008|publisher=Doubleday|isbn= 978-0-385-50625-0|page=152|url=http://www.slaverybyanothername.com/the-book/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southern states and private businesses boomed with this free labor. It is estimated that up to 40% of blacks in the South were trapped in peonage in the beginning of the 20th century. Overseers and owners often used severe deprivation, beatings, whippings, and other abuse as "discipline" against the workers.&lt;ref&gt;Blackmon (2008), ''Slavery by Another Name'', p.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:"AND WHILE YOU'RE IN THERE, FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT A FELLOW NAMED ABE LINCOLN" - NARA - 535605.tif|thumb|right|250px|Cartoon of Indictment of US Planters  and negro peonage]]
After the Civil War, the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] prohibited involuntary servitude such as peonage for all but convicted criminals. [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] also passed various laws to protect the constitutional rights of Southern blacks, making those who violated such rights by conspiracy, by trespass, or in disguise, guilty of an offence punishable by ten years in prison and civil disability. Unlawful use of state law to subvert rights under the Federal Constitution was made punishable by fine or a year's imprisonment. Until the involuntary servitude was abolished by president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in 1966, sharecroppers in Southern states were forced to continue working to pay off old debts or to pay taxes. Southern states allowed this in order to preserve sharecropping.

Because of the Spanish tradition, peonage was still widespread in [[New Mexico Territory]] after the [[American Civil War]]. Because New Mexico laws supported peonage, the [[US Congress]] passed an anti-peonage law on March 2, 1867 as follows: "Sec 1990. The holding of any person to service or labor under the system known as peonage is abolished and forever prohibited in the territory of New Mexico, or in any other territory or state of the United States; and all acts, laws, … made to establish, maintain, or enforce, directly or indirectly, the voluntary or involuntary service or labour of any persons as peons, in liquidation of any debt or obligation, or otherwise, are declared null and void."&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court Reporter, West Publishing Co, Bailey v. Alabama (1910), page 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The current version of this statute is codified at Chapter 21-I of {{usc|42|1994}} and makes no specific mention of New Mexico.

With the [[Peonage Act of 1867]], Congress abolished "the holding of any person to service or labor under the system known as peonage",&lt;ref&gt;Goluboff, "Lost Origins of Civil Rights" (2001), p. 1638.&lt;/ref&gt; specifically banning "the voluntary or involuntary service or labor of any persons as peons, in liquidation of any debt or obligation, or otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Soifer, "Prohibition of Voluntary Peonage" (2012), p. 1617.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the Department of Justice created the Civil Rights Section, which focused primarily on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and [[labor rights|labor]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;Goluboff, "Lost Origins of Civil Rights" (2001), p. 1616.&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing scrutiny of [[totalitarianism]] in the lead-up to World War II brought increased attention to issues of slavery and involuntary servitude, abroad and at home.&lt;ref&gt;Goluboff, "Lost Origins of Civil Rights" (2001), pp. 1619–1621.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. sought to counter foreign propaganda and increase its credibility on the race issue by combatting the Southern peonage system.&lt;ref&gt;Goluboff, "Lost Origins of Civil Rights" (2001), pp. 1626–1628.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of Attorney General [[Francis Biddle]], the Civil Rights Section invoked the constitutional amendments and legislation of the Reconstruction Era as the basis for its actions.&lt;ref&gt;Goluboff, "Lost Origins of Civil Rights" (2001), pp. 1629, 1635.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, the DOJ successfully prosecuted Elizabeth Ingalls for keeping domestic servant Dora L. Jones in conditions of slavery. The court found that Jones "was a person wholly subject to the will of defendant; that she was one who had no freedom of action and whose person and services were wholly under the control of defendant and who was in a state of enforced compulsory service to the defendant."&lt;ref&gt;Goluboff, "Lost Origins of Civil Rights" (2001), p. 1668.&lt;/ref&gt; The Thirteenth Amendment enjoyed a swell of attention during this period, but from ''[[Brown v. Board]]'' (1954) until ''[[Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.]]'' (1968) it was again eclipsed by the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Goluboff, "Lost Origins of Civil Rights", pp. 1680–1683.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Truck system ===
{{Main|truck system}}
A truck system, in the specific sense in which the term is used by [[Labor history (discipline)|labor historians]], refers to an unpopular or even exploitative form of payment associated with small, isolated and/or rural communities, in which workers or [[self-employed]] small producers are paid in either: goods, a form of payment known as [[truck system|truck wages]], or; tokens, [[scrip|private currency]] or direct credit, to be used at a '''company store''', owned by their employers. A specific kind of truck system, in which credit advances are made against future work is known as [[debt bondage]].

Under this system, workers were not paid cash; rather they were paid with non-transferable credit vouchers which could be exchanged only for goods sold at the company store. This made it impossible for workers to store up cash savings. Workers also usually lived in company-owned dormitories or houses, the rent for which was automatically deducted from their pay. In the United States the truck system and associated debt bondage persisted until the strikes of the newly formed [[United Mine Workers]] and affiliated [[labour union|unions]] forced an end to such practices.

=== Under chattel slavery ===
{{Main|Treatment of slaves in the United States#Rape and sexual abuse}}
[[File:Christiaen van Couwenbergh - Three Young White Men and a Black Woman - WGA5568.jpg|thumb|''Three Young White Men and a Black Woman'' (1632) by [[Christiaen van Couwenbergh]].]]
From the beginning of African slavery in the North American colonies, slaves were often viewed as property, rather than people. Slave women were often raped by white overseers, planter's younger sons before they married, and other white men associated with the slaveholders. Some were sold into brothels outright. ''[[Plaçage]]'', a formalized system of concubinage among slave women or [[free people of color]], developed in Louisiana and particularly New Orleans by the 18th century.

Slave breeding was the attempt by a slave-owner to influence the reproduction of his slaves for profit.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, Manning, ''How capitalism underdeveloped Black America: problems in race, political economy, and society'' South End Press, 2000, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; It included forced sexual relations between male and female slaves, encouraging slave pregnancies, sexual relations between master and slave to produce slave children and favoring female slaves who had many children.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ibid., p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[E. Franklin Frazier]], in his book ''The Negro Family'', stated that "there were masters who, without any regard for the preferences of their slaves, mated their human chattel as they did their stock". Ex-slave Maggie Stenhouse remarked, "Durin' slavery there were stockmen. They was weighed and tested. A man would rent the stockman and put him in a room with some young women he wanted to raise children from."&lt;ref&gt;Work Projects Administration, ''Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews with Former Slaves, Arkansas Narratives, Part 6'', Kessinger Publishing, 2004, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many female slaves (known as "fancy maids") were sold at auction into concubinage or prostitution, which was called the "fancy trade".&lt;ref name="Moon, p 235"&gt;Moon, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Concubine slaves were the only female slaves who commanded a higher price than skilled male slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Baptist, Edward E. {{"'}}Cuffy', 'Fancy Maids', and 'One-Eyed Men': Rape Commodification, and the Domestic Slave Trade in the United States", in ''The Chattel Principle: Internal Slave Trades in the Americas'', Walter Johnson (Ed.), Yale University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Louisiana ===
{{Main|Plaçage}}
[[Image:departcassettegirls.jpg|left|thumbnail|A print depicting 'comfort women' embarking unwillingly for the Americas]]
The plaçage system developed from the predominance of men among early colonial populations, who took women as consorts from Native Americans and enslaved Africans. In this period there was a shortage of European women, as the colonies were dominated in the early day by male explorers and colonists. Given the harsh conditions in Louisiana, persuading women to follow the men was not easy. France sent females convicted along with their debtor husbands, and in 1719, deported 209 women felons "who were of a character to be sent to the French settlement in Louisiana".&lt;ref&gt;Katy F. Morlas, "La Madame et la Mademoiselle," graduate thesis in history, Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; France also relocated young women orphans known as [[King's Daughters]] ({{lang-fr|filles du roi}}) to their colonies for marriage: to both Canada and Louisiana.

Through warfare and raids, Native American women were often captured to be traded, sold, or taken as wives. At first, the colony generally imported male Africans to use as slave labor because of the heavy work of clearing to develop plantations. Over time, it also imported African female slaves. Marriage between the races was forbidden according to the [[Code Noir]] of the eighteenth century, but interracial sex continued. The upper class [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] men during this period often did not marry until their late twenties or early thirties. [[Premarital sex]] with an intended white bride, especially if she was of high rank, was not permitted socially.

White male colonists, often the younger sons of noblemen, military men, and planters, who needed to accumulate some wealth before they could marry, took women of color as consorts before marriage. Merchants and administrators also followed this practice if they were wealthy enough. A white man might rape a slave as young as twelve.

=== Post-emancipation ===
After slaves were emancipated, many states passed [[anti-miscegenation laws]], which prohibited [[interracial marriage]] between whites and non-whites. But this did not stop white men from taking sexual advantage of black women by using their social positions of power under the [[Jim Crow]] system and [[white supremacy]], or in other parts of the country by ordinary power and wealth dynamics.

During the [[California Gold Rush]] in the late 1840s, Chinese merchants transported thousands of young Chinese girls, including babies, from China to the United States and sold them into sexual slavery within the red light district of San Francisco. Girls could be bought for as little as $40 (about $1104 in 2013 dollars) in [[Guangzhou]], and sold for $400 (about $11,040 in 2013 dollars) in the United States. Many of these girls were forced into [[opium]] addiction and lived their entire lives as prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sfmuseum.net/hist6/evans.html |title=A la California.

A few captives from [[Tribe (Native American)|Native American tribe]]s who were used as slaves were not freed when African-American slaves were emancipated. "Ute Woman", a [[Ute people|Ute]] captured by the [[Arapaho]] and later sold to a [[Cheyenne]], was one example. Used as a [[prostitute]] for sale to American soldiers at [[Canton, Oklahoma|Cantonment]] in the [[Indian Territory]], she lived in slavery until about 1880 when she died of a [[Bleeding|hemorrhage]] resulting from "excessive sexual intercourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald J. |last=Berthrong |title=The Cheyenne and Arapaho Ordeal: Reservation and Agency Life in the Indian Territory, 1875 to 1907 |location= |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |year=1976 |isbn=0-8061-1277-8 |page=124 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3AZR7KdHhtIC&amp;pg=PA124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White slavery ===
[[File:60000girls.png|thumb|upright|Ad warning about white slavery|right]]

By the 19th century, most of America's cities had a designated, legally protected [[Red-light district|area of prostitution]]. Increased urbanization and young women entering the workforce led to greater flexibility in [[courtship]] without supervision. It is in this changing social sphere that the panic over "white slavery" began. This term referred to women being [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] for the purposes of prostitution.{{citation needed|date = June 2014}}

Numerous communities appointed [[vice]] commissions to investigate the extent of local prostitution, whether prostitutes participated in it willingly or were forced into it and the degree to which it was organized by any [[cartel]]-type organizations. The second significant action at the local levels was to close the [[brothel]]s and the [[red light districts]]. From 1910 to 1913, city after city withdrew this tolerance and forced the closing of their brothels. Opposition to openly practiced prostitution had been growing steadily throughout the last decades of the 19th century. The federal government's response to the [[moral panic]] was the Mann Act. The purpose of the act was to make it a crime to coerce transportation of unwilling women. The statute made it a crime to "transport or cause to be transported, or aid to assist in obtaining transportation for" or to "persuade, induce, entice or coerce" a woman to travel.&lt;ref name="Brian K 2004"&gt;Brian K. Landsberg. ''Major Acts of Congress''. Macmillan Reference USA: The Gale Group, 2004. 251–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Mark Thomas Connelly, "a group of books and pamphlets appeared announcing a startling claim: a pervasive and depraved conspiracy was at large in the land, brutally trapping and seducing American girls into lives of enforced prostitution, or 'white slavery'. These white slave narratives, or white-slave tracts, began to circulate around 1909."&lt;ref name="Bell1910"&gt;Bell, Ernest Albert. ''[https://archive.org/stream/fightingtraffici00bell#page/n5/mode/2up The War on the White Slave Trade]''.

This excerpt from ''The War on the White Slave Trade'' was written by the United States District Attorney in Chicago:
{{quote|One thing should be made very clear to the girl who comes up to the city, and that is that the ordinary ice cream parlor is very likely to be a spider's web for her entanglement.

[[File:Rose Livingstone in 1913.png|thumb|upright|[[Rose Livingston]], known as the ''Angel of Chinatown'', worked to free slaves in New York City|left]]
In 1910, the US Congress passed the [[Mann Act|White Slave Traffic Act of 1910]] (better known as the Mann Act), which made it a [[felony]] to transport women across state borders for the purpose of "prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose". Its primary stated intent was to address prostitution, immorality, and human trafficking particularly where it was trafficking for the purposes of prostitution, but the ambiguity of "immoral purpose" effectively criminalized [[interracial marriage]] and banned single women from crossing state borders for morally wrong acts. As more women were being trafficked from foreign countries, the US began passing immigration acts to curtail aliens from entering the country. Several acts such as the [[Emergency Quota Act]] of 1921 and [[Immigration Act of 1924]] were passed to prevent emigrants from Europe and Asia from entering the United States. Following the banning of immigrants during the 1920s, human trafficking was not considered a major issue until the 1990s.&lt;ref name="candidate"&gt;Candidate, Jo Doezema Ph.D. "Loose women or lost women?

''White slave crusades: race, gender, and anti-vice activism, 1887–1917''. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1921 Convention set new goals for international efforts to stem human trafficking, primarily by giving the anti-trafficking movement further official recognition, as well as a bureaucratic apparatus to research and fight the problem. The Advisory Committee on the Traffic of Women and Children was a permanent advisory committee of the League. Its members were nine countries, and several non-governmental organizations. An important development was the implementation of a system of annual reports of member countries. Member countries formed their own centralized offices to track and report on trafficking of women and children.&lt;ref name="Brian K 2004"/&gt; The advisory committee also worked to expand its research and intervention program beyond the United States and Europe. In 1929, a need to expand into the Near East (Asia Minor), the Middle East and Asia was acknowledged. An international conference of central authorities in Asia was planned for 1937, but no further action was taken during the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Faue.

==Labor trafficking==
{{Main|Labor trafficking in the United States}}
According to the National Human Rights Center in Berkeley, California, there are currently about 10,000 forced laborers in the U.S., around one-third of whom are domestic servants and some portion of whom are children. In reality, this number could be far higher due to the difficulty in getting exact numbers of victims, due to the secretive nature of human trafficking. The U.S. government only keeps a count of survivors, defined as victims of severe instances of human trafficking, who have been assisted by the government in acquiring immigration benefits.&lt;ref name="freetheslaves2004"&gt;{{Citation

'''Isaac Dudley Fletcher''' (1844 – 1917) was a US businessman, art collector and museum benefactor.

He had the mansion built that is called today the [[Harry F. Sinclair House]]. He was president of Barrett Manufacturing Company and acquired a large art collection which he bequeathed to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=MET&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3253700.pdf.bannered.pdf|format=PDF|title=1918 museum bulletin describing the bequeathed collection|website=Metmuseum.org|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Frick library, he owned work by "David, Gainsborough, Rembrandt, Reynolds, and Rubens, Alexander H Wyant, Corot and Daubigny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.frick.org/directoryweb/browserecord.php?-action=browse&amp;-recid=7443|title=Fletcher, Isaac Dudley, 1844-1917|website=Research.frick.org|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "work by David" referred to the ''[[Portrait of Charlotte du Val d'Ognes (Marie-Denise Villers)|Portrait of Charlotte du Val d'Ognes]]'', which at the time of the bequest in 1917 was still attributed to Jacques-Louis David, but since 1995 has been attributed to [[Marie-Denise Villers]].

Besides the collection itself, the bequest included a large sum of money to start a fund for the purchase of art. According to the 1994 Museum guidebook, several of the paintings listed were purchased through the ''Fletcher Fund'', most notably the ''[[Portrait of Juan de Pareja]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=zoM2KmG_ndgC&amp;pg=PA169|title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Guide|first1=Philippe De|last1=Montebello|date=28 August 1994|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=28 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ishango bone''' is a [[bone tool]], dated to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era.  It is a dark brown length of bone, the [[fibula]] of a [[baboon]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~schultz/3M3/history.html A very brief history of pure mathematics: The Ishango Bone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721075947/http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~schultz/3M3/history.html |date=2008-07-21 }} [[University of Western Australia]] School of Mathematics - accessed January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  with a sharp piece of [[quartz]] affixed to one end, perhaps for engraving. It was first thought to be a [[tally stick]], as it has a series of what has been interpreted as [[tally marks]] carved in three columns running the length of the tool, though it has also been suggested that the scratches might have been to create a better grip on the handle or for some other non-mathematical reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudman|first=Peter Strom|title=How Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years|year=2007|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-59102-477-4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Ishango bone was found in 1960 by Belgian [[Jean de Heinzelin de Braucourt]] while exploring what was then the [[Belgian Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;de Heinzelin, Jean: "Ishango", ''[[Scientific American]]'', 206:6 (June 1962) 105--116.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was discovered in the area of [[Ishango]] near the [[Semliki River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Edward|url=http://ishango.naturalsciences.be/Flash/flash_local/Ishango-04-EN.html|website=Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lake Edward]] empties into the Semliki which forms part of the headwaters of the [[Nile River]] (now on the border between modern-day [[Uganda]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|D.R. Congo]]). The bone was found among the remains of a small community that fished and gathered in this area of Africa.  The settlement had been buried in a [[Volcano|volcanic eruption]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Scott W.: "[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/ishango.html Mathematicians of the African Diaspora]" The Mathematics Department of The [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Huylebrouck, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p5028653585x380j/fulltext.pdf?page=1 ''The Bone that Began the Space Odyssey''], The [[Mathematical Intelligencer]] vol 18 no. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The artifact was first estimated to have originated between 9,000&amp;nbsp;BC and 6,500&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Gerdes, Paulus (1991): [http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/AMU/amu_chma_09.html#beginnings On The History of Mathematics in Africa South of the Sahara]; [[African Mathematical Union]], Commission on the History of Mathematics in Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;  
However, the dating of the site where it was discovered was re-evaluated, and it is now believed to be more than 20,000 years old (between 18,000&amp;nbsp;BC and 20,000&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref name=Marshack&gt;Marshack, Alexander (1991): ''The Roots of Civilization'', Colonial Hill, Mount Kisco, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooks,  A.S. and Smith, C.C. (1987): "Ishango revisited: new age determinations and cultural interpretations", ''The African Archaeological Review'', 5 : 65-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ishango bone is on permanent exhibition at the [[Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]], [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=RBINS_intro&gt;[https://www.naturalsciences.be/expo/old_ishango/en/ishango/introduction.html Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051733/https://www.naturalsciences.be/expo/old_ishango/en/ishango/introduction.html |date=2016-03-04 }}, [[Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]], Brussels, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RBINS_flash&gt;[http://ishango.naturalsciences.be/Flash/flash_local/Ishango-02-EN.html Flash presentation], [[Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]], Brussels, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;[http://www2.astronomicalheritage.net/index.php/show-entity?identity=4&amp;idsubentity=1 The Ishango Bone, Democratic Republic of the Congo], on permanent display at the [[Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]], Brussels, Belgium.

== Mathematical interpretations ==

[[File:IshangoColumnA.png|right|frame|Third (or "left") column (to the right in picture), from bottom to top]]
The etchings on the bone are in three columns with marks [[asymmetry|asymmetrically]] grouped into sets, leading to "various tantalizing hypotheses",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Numbers and the Making of Us: Counting and the Course of Human Cultures|first=Caleb|last=Everett|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780674504431|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2f1aDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as that the implement was used as a counting tool for simple mathematical procedures or even to construct a [[numeral system]]. 

The third column has been interpreted as a "table of prime numbers",&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Scott W.: "Mathematicians of the African Diaspora" The Mathematics Department of The State University of New York at Buffalo.[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/ishango.html]&lt;/ref&gt; but it is more likely to be a coincidence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Historian of mathematics Peter S. Rudman argues that prime numbers were probably not understood until about 500 BC, and were dependent on the concept of division, which he dates to no earlier than 10,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years|last=Rudman|first=Peter Strom|publisher=Prometheus Books|year=2007|isbn=978-1-59102-477-4|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Alexander Marshack]] speculated that the Ishango bone represents a six-month [[lunar calendar]].&lt;ref name=Marshack /&gt; This has led [[Claudia Zaslavsky]] to suggest that the creator of the tool may have been a woman, tracking the [[lunar phase]] in relation to the [[menstrual cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;Zaslavsky, Claudia: ''Africa Counts: Number and Pattern in African Culture'', L. Hill, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaslavsky, Claudia: "[http://web.nmsu.edu/~pscott/isgem71.htm Women as the First Mathematicians]", ''International Study Group on Ethnomathematics Newsletter'', Volume 7 Number 1, 1992|January 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; This is countered with the argument that Marshack overinterprets the data and that the evidence does not support lunar calendars.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Judy. 1992. Not counting on Marshack: a reassessment of the work of Alexander Marshack on notation in the Upper Palaeolithic. Journal of Mediterranean Studies 2(1): 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second bone==
During earlier excavations at the Ishango site in 1959, another bone was also found. It is lighter in color and was scraped, thinned, polished, and broken on one end, revealing it to be hollow. The artifact possibly held a piece of quartz like the more well-known bone or it could have been a tool handle. The 14-cm long bone has 90 notches on six sides, which are categorized as "major" or "minor" according to their length. Jean de Heinzelin interpreted the major notches as being units or multiples and the minor notches as fractions or subsidiary. He believed the bone to be an "interchange rule between bases 10 and 12."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Second Bone|url=http://ishango.naturalsciences.be/Flash/flash_local/Ishango-24-EN.html|website=Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jaromarsburg 2.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|Ramparts of the Jaromarsburg]]

The '''Jaromarsburg''' was a [[cult]] site for the [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribe of [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Rani]] dedicated to the [[god]] [[Svantovit]] and used from the 9th to the 12th century. It was located on the northeastern tip of the [[Baltic Sea]] island of [[Rügen]] at [[Cape Arkona]], and was protected on two sides by the [[cliffed coast]] and from the land side by a [[Slavic burgwall]]. The name of the temple hill is derived from the Rani prince, [[Jaromar I]], who became a vassal of the Danish king, [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Valdemar I]] in 1168 after Rügen was conquered by [[Denmark]].

At Cape Arkona in recent centuries, sections of the [[cliffed coast|cliff tops]] have continually collapsed into the sea, which is why the remnants of the Jaromarsburg today mainly comprise the castle ramparts. Based on a loss of 10 to 20 metres per century, it is believed that the current area within the ramparts represents only a third of the original total. As a result, for several years urgent archaeological excavations have taken place, which have uncovered the site of the Svetovid temple, which had been thought for a long time had been lost to coastal collapse. It is a rectangular area that was completely free of artifacts, but to find around which, however, articles were discovered that may have been offerings, including parts of broken weapons. This is consistent with the historical account by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], who states that the priests inside the temple were not even allowed to breathe within its confines, so as not to defile it.

== Structure ==
[[File:Rügen - Jaromarsburg - Infotafel - nah.jpg|thumb|left|Information board with a depiction of the castle]]
[[File:Jaromarsburg 3.jpg|thumb|Ramparts on Cape Arkona]]

The castle consisted of two successive [[Defensive wall|ramparts]] that reached a height of 13 metres, plus additional fortifications. The fortifications and the temple were made of wood. Originally, the fortifications extended 300 metres on a north-south axis and 350 metres east-west. According to the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus the temple was surrounded by two enclosures, the outer one covered by a purple roof. Inside was a four-metre-high statue of [[Svetovid]], carved from an oak trunk. Saxo Grammaticus writes: ''In its right hand the figure held a drinking horn, made of various metals. The priest filled it each year with mead and from that which had been lost over the year prophesied about the coming harvest .''

It is believed that settlements related to the temple were located on the sites where today the fishing villages of [[Vitt]] and [[Putgarten]] now stand. The name of the latter means "at the foot of the castle".&lt;div style="clear:left;"  &gt;&lt;/div&gt;

[[File:Svantevitstein 2.jpg|thumb|The Svantevit Stone]]

From about the 9th century the [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Rani]] settled on Rügen; they probably built the sanctuary at this time and then erected the castle and fortifications in several stages.&lt;ref&gt;Torsten Kempke: Skandinavisch-slawische Kontakte an der südlichen Ostseeküste im 7. bis 9. Jahrhundert, in Ole Harck, Christian Lübke (Hrsgg.): Zwischen Reric und Bornhöved. Die Beziehungen zwischen den Dänen und ihren slawischen Nachbarn vom 9. bis ins 13. Jahrhundert (Forschungen zur Geschichte und Kultur des Östlichen Mitteleuropa, vol. 11), Stuttgart 2000, pp. 9–22, esp. p. 14; Heike Reimann, Fred Ruchhöft, Cornelia Willich: Rügen im Mittelalter. Eine interdisziplinäre Studie zur mittelalterlichen Besiedlung auf Rügen (Forschungen zur Geschichte und Kultur des Östlichen Mitteleuropa, vol. 36), Stuttgart 2011, pp. 42 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 11th century the rampart was raised further using soil from the inner area of the castle. The Rani dominated Rügen for some time and the temple increased in importance as a religious centre for the Slavs in the southern Baltic following the destruction of [[Rethra]] in 1068. The temple served as [[oracle]] site and received offerings from other peoples, not just the Slavs.

But as early as 1136, a Danish army under King [[Eric II of Denmark|Eric the Memorable]] had captured the temple fortress. The defeated Rani pledged the adoption of Christianity, but reneged on their agreement after the withdrawal of the Danes. In 1157, a storm destroyed a Slavic fleet of 1,500 ships off the [[Norway|Norwegian]] coast. The Danish king, [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Waldemar I]], made used of this weakness to mount an offensive against Rügen, which was the stronghold of the Rani. After a series of attacks, ambushes and partial victories, he landed at Arkona with his fleet on 19 May 1168, accompanied by his army commander and close friend, Bishop [[Absalon of Lund|Absalon]]. On 15 June 1168 the temple fortress was taken after four weeks of siege, when the attackers succeeded by day, in starting a fire at an unobserved point, which the defenders of the castle could not put out due to a shortage of water. The temple was then destroyed, the Svetovid statue chopped up and burned.

After the fall of the temple the princes of the Rügen Slavs, [[Tetzlav]], who until then was the king of Rani, and his brother,  Jaromar, who lived in their capital at [[Charenza]], submitted to the Danish king. After the death of Tetzlav in 1170, Jaromar was Prince of the Rani until 1218. With the fall of the temple, King Valdemar got his hands on a treasure, but in 1171, he had to share this with his ally, [[Henry the Lion]]. The extensive estates of the temple were given to the Church.

In 1169 Rügen came under the suzerainty of the [[bishop]]s of [[Lund]], who oversaw the spread of [[Christianity]]. Numerous chapels were built on former cult and burial places. In the area of the former Svetovid sanctuary, the first Christian church was built on Rügen. In the nearby church of [[Altenkirchen (Rügen)|Altenkirchen]], the building of which had probably already begun by 1185, is the Priest Stone (''Priesterstein'') or Svantevit Stone (''Svantevitstein'') – just above the foundation base – which is laid on its side. There are different interpretations for this stone. It is possible that the stone relief was carved in the pre-Christian era on Rügen, and could have represented the Slavic god, Svantevit, to the priest, because only he had the right to touch the large and ornate drinking horn of Svantevit's. But it could also be the grave stone of Prince Tetzlav, who had been given the peninsula of [[Wittow]], after the Danish conquest of Rügen.  Furthermore, it is assumed that the position of the stone represents the superiority of God over the pagan gods.

== Archaeological investigations ==
The Jaromarsburg at Arkona is the only rampart for which we have detailed contemporaneous accounts. The castle was investigated by archaeologists multiple times due to the erosion constantly occurring around the castle.  An information board in the Archaeological exhibition in Schwerin in 1995 showed this very clearly. The castle area has decreased in 1000 years to 1/3 of its original size.

This led the archaeologists to investigate the castle before it disappeared completely in the sea. Carl Schuchardt, an archaeologist from Berlin, undertook in 1921 the first known investigation. An important finding was that the written reports of the Saxos were correct and the space around the temple as a place of worship was empty. The west of the temple showed a smaller, but now leveled Wall, behind the big Wall which showed the living area. Whether that was meant for the cult priests and their servants or as a refuge for the surrounding settlements as well as a craft store, could not be determined until today.

In 1930, Wilhelm Petzsch investigated the wall and documented the findings. The most important result was that he found the fight film from 1136 (conquest by Danish King Erich II)  under the combat and fire layer from 1168 (Danish King Waldemar I.). A deeper burnt layer was still present, which he dated to 1000.

'''John William Bund Willis-Bund'''  {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|JP}} (8 August 1843 – 7 June 1928) was a British historian and local [[Worcestershire]] politician.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;Robert Thomas Jenkins, [http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-WILL-WIL-1843.html  WILLIS-BUND  (formerly WILLIS), JOHN WILLIAM (1843-1928)], [http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/index.html Welsh Biography Online], Retrieved 2009-11-05. An electronic version of a publication by the [[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Willis-Bund was born in 1843 at [[Rushwick|Wick Episcopi, Worcestershire]], the son of [[John Walpole Willis]] and his second wife Ann Susanna Kent [[Bund family of Wick Episcopi|Bund]]. The adoption of his mother's surname (in 1864)&lt;ref name="John Venn 1898, pg 354"&gt;Biographical History of Gonville and Caius College 1349-1897 vol. II 1713-1897, John Venn, Cambridge University Press/ C. J. Clay and Sons, 1898, pg 354&lt;/ref&gt; was necessary in order to inherit from his maternal grandfather. He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Caius College, Cambridge]], graduating [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1865 with first-class honours in Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=WLS861JW|name=Willis (post Willis-Bund), John William Bund}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also awarded an [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] (1865) and an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] (1868).&lt;ref name="John Venn 1898, pg 354"/&gt; He was [[Call to the Bar|called to the Bar]] from [[Lincoln's Inn]].&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt; In the course of his legal career he was appointed [[Queen's Counsel|King's Counsel]].&lt;ref&gt;Truth, volume 57, 1905, pg 1510&lt;/ref&gt; Willis-Bund was Professor of Constitutional Law and History at [[King's College London]] from 1869 to 1882, and Lecturer in Law at the [[University of Bristol]] from 1877 to 1879.&lt;ref name="John Venn 1898, pg 354"/&gt;

[[Robert Thomas Jenkins]] noted that Willis-Bund wrote extensively about the history of the church in Wales but that some of his views were not generally held to be those of other academics writing in the field. Jenkins commented on his editing of the Black Book of St. Davids in 1902 for the [[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion]]: '...the work was but indifferently done', and mentioned another of Willis-Bund's books, ''The Celtic Church of Wales'', 1897, which propounded a theory of his own and was, Jenkins states, judged by [[Louis Gougaud]] to be "dubious and prejudiced," and by Sir [[J. E. Lloyd]] to be "very haphazard".&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/30006631 Biograph on Louis Gougaud]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Gougaud observed that Willis-Bund's views (along with those of [[Rice Rees]]), were 'widely different' from 'those adopted by present-day historians on the relation of ancient Celtic Christianity to the See of Peter',&lt;ref&gt;The Month, vol. 169, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; and Lloyd further stated that the work was a 'book of original, but highly disputable, views.'&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Lloyd and the Creation of Welsh History: Renewing a Nation's Past, Huw Pryce, University of Wales Press, 2011, end-note 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Church Quarterly Review]], in summary at the end of its review of the volume, concluded: 'We have not refrained from pointing out what we think the weak points of Mr Willis Bund's book: but the book is far better than its weakest points'. The book was considered a 'detailed' 'study of the institutions of ancient Welsh Christianity'.&lt;ref&gt;Church Quarterly Review, vol. 45, 1898, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Willis-Bund was referred to by the Welsh politician [[Clement Edwards]] in a 1914 House of Commons debate on the Established Church in Wales as 'a great authority... one of the greatest authorities on the history of the old Welsh Church'. Sir [[Arthur Griffith-Boscawen]], however, in response, observed that Willis-Bund 'never got any support for the theory' in question, regarding the origins of [[tithe|tithing]].&lt;ref&gt;https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1914-04-20/debates/40d7a68c-a73f-46ee-aa9b-0392ffeee796/EstablishedChurch(Wales)Bill&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as chairman of the Worcestershire County Council, the Worcestershire Appeal Tribunal, and the Worcestershire National Relief Fund during the First World War. He was appointed a Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1918 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30460 |date=7 January 1918 |page=372 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927 he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Law from the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;Gloucester Journal, 9 July 1927&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed Vice-Lieutenant of the County of Worcester in November 1924. He was a [[List of Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London|Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries]].&lt;ref name="John Venn 1898, pg 354"/&gt;

On his death in 1928, it was stated in ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' that "a finer old man, with a more dominating personality, than the late Mr. Willis Bund would be hard to find, even in this country".&lt;ref&gt;Gloucester Citizen, 13 January 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Willis-Bund married firstly (in 1872) Harriette Penelope Temple, the daughter (by his second wife) of Richard Temple. Temple's eldest son, also named [[Sir Richard Temple, 1st Baronet|Richard]], became the first baronet Temple of the Nash. The Willis-Bunds had six children. His surviving son and heir, Henry, [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians|MRCP]] [[Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons|LRCS]], died, unmarried, nine months after his father, having received the [[Military Cross]] whilst serving in the [[R.A.M.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Landed Gentry 1925, pg 235&lt;/ref&gt; Willis-Bund's daughter Margaret married John Henry [[Henry Milward &amp; Sons|Milward]], of the [[Redditch]] needle-manufacturing family. Daughter Mary Susanna's son, [[Francis MacCarthy Willis Bund|Francis Leader MacCarthy-Willis-Bund]] (1905–1980), was Chaplain, Fellow and Dean of [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. Willis-Bund married secondly (in 1896) Mary Elizabeth Thackeray, the daughter of General [[Frederick Rennell Thackeray]] and Lady Elizabeth Margaret Carnegie (the daughter of the 7th [[Earl of Northesk]]). Mary Elizabeth Thackeray was the widow of Colonel Alexander Essex Frederick Holcombe, and second cousin of the novelist [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]. Willis-Bund's uncle was the clergyman and theologian [[William Downes Willis]].

'''John Williams''' ([[bardic name]]: '''Ab Ithel''') (7 April 1811&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862|year=1863|publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Company|location=New York|page=691|url=https://archive.org/stream/1862appletonsan02newyuoft#page/n698/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;ndash;27 August 1862), was an antiquary and [[Anglican]] priest.  Born in [[Llangynhafal]], [[Denbighshire]] [[Wales]] in 1811, he graduated from [[Jesus College, Oxford]] in 1835 to become the Anglican curate of [[Llanfor]], [[Merionethshire]], where he married [[Elizabeth Lloyd Williams]].  In 1843 he became [[perpetual curate]] of [[Nercwys]], [[Flintshire]], and [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Llanymawddwy]], [[Merionethshire]], in 1849.

== Writing career ==
For much of his early life he adopted the pseudonym Cynhaval, after his birthplace in Llangynhafal, [[Denbighshire]], however took the pseudonym Ab Ithel from the surname of his grandfather, William Bethell.  His first book entitled ''[[The Church of England]] independent of the [[Catholic Church|Church of Rome]] in all ages'', concerned the relationship between the Church of England and [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]].  This book was published in 1836.  It was followed by another in 1844 on the [[ecclesiastical]] [[antiquities]] of Wales entitled ''Ecclesiastical Antiquities of the Cymry'' or ''The Ancient British Church''.  In 1856 [[Archdeacon]] Williams produced ''Rules of [[Welsh poetry|Welsh Poetry]]'' and ''Medical Practice of Rhinwallon and his Sons'' with the Welsh MSS. Society.  By 1860 he had two more pieces of work ready for publication; ''Chronicle of the Princes'', and ''Annales Cambriae'' were both published in [[Rolls series]].

Williams was industrious both as a [[parish priest]] and as an [[antiquary]].  He was regarded by many of his contemporaries as one of the leading Welsh scholars of his day, and was able to exert a considerable and decidedly mixed influence on the course of Welsh scholarship.  Nonetheless his enthusiasm and Welsh nationalist fervour, cause some to criticize him of being uncritical in his approach to the historical record and strongly influenced by Edward Williams ([[Iolo Morganwg]], 1747–1826).

== Professional contributions ==
In 1846, together with [[Harry Longueville Jones]] (1806–1870), another cleric and antiquary, Williams founded the [[Cambrian Archaeological Association]], whose journal, ''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]'', he edited until 1853, when he and Jones quarrelled over editorial policy. He also published an edition and translation of the ''[[Y Gododdin|Gododdin]]'' in 1852, established the ''[[Cambrian Journal]]'', which he edited from 1854 until his death, and was prominent in the [[Welsh Manuscripts Society]], editing four of its publications.  The [[Llangollen Eisteddfod]] of 1858, which he organized together with [[Richard Williams Morgan]] ('Mor Meirion', c. 1815-c. 1889) and [[Joseph Hughes (Carn Ingli)|Joseph Hughes]] ('Carn Ingli', 1803–1863), caused much derision and embarrassment; Williams' own family won several prizes, and [[Thomas Stephens (historian)|Thomas Stephens]] (1821–1875) was adjudicated against because he suggested that the story of Madog ab Owain Gwynedd's American expeditions was not true. Williams was nevertheless considered for the chair of Celtic at [[Oxford University]], and he was appointed by the government in 1858 to complete the editions of the medieval Welsh chronicles [[Annales Cambriae]] and Brut y Tywysogion, which had been left incomplete by [[Aneurin Owen]] (1792–1851), and which were published in 1860.  His editorial work was later criticised by academics due to his lack of the diplomatic skills for interpreting medieval manuscripts.

== Religious appointments ==
Williams became rector of Llanenddwyn and Llanddwywe, Merionethshire, in 1862, by which time he was very ill, and he died in the same year. The Ab Ithel Memorial Fund was established in his memory.

== Writings, letters, and collections ==
Many of the letters and papers of Rev. John Williams ('Ab Ithel') and his family exist today in drafts or incomplete copy.  His collection includes letters to his family 1832-1898; page-proofs of parts of Brut y Tywysogion; drafts in manuscript of several of Ab Ithel's printed works, including Y Gododdin, The Traditionary Annals of the Cymry, Druidism, Brut y Tywysogion, and Annales Cambriae; contributions to the Cambrian Journal; his address at the Conwy Eisteddfod, 1861; papers relating to his collation to the rectory of Llanymawddwy, 1849; 'The Church of England independent of the Church of Rome in all ages'; sermons in English and Welsh; 'A few plain and practical Observations on Anglican Education'; the prize essay on the question 'whether the British Druids offered human sacrifices' by 'Hu Gadarn'; an essay entitled 'Traethawd ar Ddarganfyddiad yr America Gan Madog ab Owain Gwynedd, yn nghylch y ddeuddegfed ganrif' by 'Columbus'; an essay 'On the state of Agriculture and the progress of Arts &amp; Manufactures in Britain, during the period &amp; under the influence of the Druidical System' by Rev. John Jones, Llanllyfni (see Archaeologia Cambrensis, Supplement 1850); 'Y Telynwr Cymreig, sef cyfarwyddiadau i ddysgu'r Delyn' by 'Dafydd Frenin'; four essays on 'Y manteision a ddeillia i'r Cymry o ddysgu yr iaith Seisnig' by 'Uthr Bendragon', 'Eiddil', 'Gwir Gymro', and 'Y cynyg cynta' 'rioed'; a 'History of Wales to the death of Llewelyn'; sections of a work on Christianity in Britain; letters addressed to Ab Ithel and also to his wife and daughters; press cuttings and extracts; sketches and medical and household recipes, and letters, 1884–1885, relating to the Ab Ithel Memorial Fund.

The publication of the [http://www.nacbs.org/ North American Conference on British Studies], '''''The Journal of British Studies''''' is an [[academic journal]] aimed at scholars of [[British culture]] from the Middle Ages through the present. The journal was co-founded in 1961 by [[George B. Cooper (historian)|George Cooper]]. JBS presents scholarly articles and book reviews from renowned international authors who share their ideas on [[British society]], [[politics]], [[law]], [[economics]], and the [[arts]].  Until 2005 it covered subjects from the medieval period to the present, while ''[[Albion (journal)|Albion]]'' (another journal published by the NACBS) covered all periods of British history.

'''Le Grand-Pressigny''' is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Indre-et-Loire]] [[Departments of France|department]] in central [[France]].

There is a [[Chalcolithic]] [[flint]] mine located in the commune. It produced an unusual caramel-coloured stone which appears to have been highly prized across Europe with examples found in the [[Pyrenees]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Switzerland]]. Blocks of flint and unfinished [[Lithic reduction#Blank|blanks]] were traded, as well as finished tools.

{{Expand list|date=July 2010}}

This page lists '''[[model car]] brand names''' past and present. The list is inclusive with slush mold, tinplate, pressed steel, diecast zamac, white metal, plastic and resin models and toys from all over the world. A few are even made of crystal, glass, wood, coal or other materials. Some of the brands here are more toy-like and others are purely for adult collectors. Some are from design model organizations and were never intended for sale. The price of some when new was less than 50 cents, while others cost hundreds or thousands of dollars. Some are kits, some are kits that are specially handbuilt, but many are factory preassembled. Some are promotional in approach while others are solidly set in the retail realm. Some are stationary and do not roll while others roll or have friction or pull-back motors. At a different end of the spectrum, many are remote control. Models of all different sizes are represented, but the typical range is between 1:18 (about 11&amp;nbsp;inches) to 1:87 (about an inch and a half).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8248">'''Maximilian Lambertz''' (27 July 1882 in [[Vienna]] – 26 August 1963 in [[Markkleeberg]] near [[Leipzig]]) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[linguist]], [[folklorist]], and a major personality of [[Albanology]].

==Biography==
In the years 1900 to 1905, he studied [[comparative linguistics]] and [[classical philology]] in Vienna, and subsequently received his [[doctorate]] with a [[dissertation]] on the "Greek slave name" (Vienna 1907). A government scholarship enabled him to travel to [[Italy]] and [[Greece]]. While in Greece, he overheard the conversation of some fishermen from [[Attica]]. He got curious when he was told that it was the [[Arvanitika]] dialect of the [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. This would change his course of work from that moment on. After his return home, he became a school teacher at Bundesgymnasium in Vienna, but in 1907 he moved to [[Munich]], where he participated in the ''[[Thesaurus Linguae Latinae]]'' project. In 1911, he returned to Vienna and took his career as a school teacher again. His first publication in the field of Albanian studies (together with [[Georg Pekmezi]]) was a teaching and reading book of Albanian (published in Vienna, 1913), ''Lehr und Lesebuch des Albanischen'' (Manual and Reader of Albanian). In the years 1913 and 1914, he traveled for several weeks depending southern Italy, to study the Albanian dialects spoken there. In particular, he devoted himself to the less known northern dialects of [[Arbëresh language|Arbëresh]], in the [[Abruzzo]] and [[Molise]] regions, especially the dialect of [[Villa Badessa]] (Alb: Badhesa). On this trip, his first collection of photographs came out.&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt;

From May to July 1916, Max Lambertz visited as part of an expedition of the Balkan Commission of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] for the first time [[North Albania|North]] and [[Central Albania]] to scientifically deal with the Albanian language and [[Albanian folklore|folklore]]. On this trip he visited [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]], [[Shkodra]], [[Lezha]], [[Kruja]], [[Tirana]], [[Durres]], the [[Kir (river)|Kir valley]], [[Shosh, Albania|Shoshi]], [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]], the valleys of the [[Drin (river)|Drin]] and [[Valbonë (river)|Valbona]] and especially [[Mirditë District|Mirdita]] where he devoted himself to the local dialect and folklore material collected. On this trip some unique photographs were taken. In December 1916, he returned to Albania, this time with the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian troops]] which in the events of [[World War I]] had occupied northern and central Albania. He was entrusted with the management of the Albanian education system and was the first foreigner member of the [[Albanian Literary Commission]], which was used by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian authorities]] to create a normalized for the school system default language. In Shkodra, he collaborated with [[Gjergj Fishta]], editor of the newspaper ''Posta e Shypnisë'' (The Albanian Post) during 1916–1918, in which he published several posts. The collected folkloric material was published in [[Sarajevo]], 1917, as ''Volkspoesie der Albaner: eine einführende Studie'' (Folk poetry of the Albanians: an introductory study).&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt;

After the war, Lambertz returned to Austria, where he taught until 1934. He also wrote books and articles on various aspects of [[Albanian culture]], especially for the folklore. After 1934 after [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] took over, he  retired as a longtime member of the [[Austrian Social Democratic Party]], enrolled at the age of fifty-three years back at the university, and studied this time [[Protestant theology]], but was his dissertation was rejected for [[racism|racial reasons]], since his mother came from a [[Austrian Jewish|Jewish family]]. In 1939, Lambertz moved to Munich, where he worked again until 1942 at the ''Thesaurus Linguae Latinae''. In 1943, he went to [[Leipzig]], where he taught [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] at the Leipzig School for Foreign Languages.&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt;

In June 1945, after had joined the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Communist Party]], he became director of the Leipzig "Fremdsprachenschule" (College of Foreign Languages), in 1946, Professor of Comparative Linguistics, and until 1949 the dean of the new Faculty of Education at the [[Leipzig University|Karl Marx University]]. Until his retirement in 1957, he was also director of the "Indo-European Institute".&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt;

Lambertz visited Albania in June 1954, and in 1957. Even after the breakdown of close political relations between Albania and the [[Warsaw Pact]], he refused to completely abandon its links with the country. He participated furthermore at receptions of the Albanian Embassy in [[East Berlin]].&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt;

As a professor of comparative linguistics at the University of Leipzig, Lambertz lived with his wife Josepha in a villa in nearby Markkleeberg. He died on August 26, 1963, was buried at the [[Döbling Cemetery]] in Vienna.&lt;ref name="NDB"&gt;{{citation| author=Gerhard Grimm| url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd121916731.html| language=German|chapter=Lambertz, Maximilian| title=Neue Deutsche Biographie (NDB)| volume=13| publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot| location=Berlin| year=1982| isbn=3-428-00194-X| page=439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3037">'''Metadata removal tool''' or '''Metadata scrubber''' is a type of [[privacy software]] built to protect the [[privacy]] of its users by removing potentially privacy-compromising [[metadata]] from files before they are shared with others, e.g., by sending them as [[e-mail attachment]]s or by posting them on the [[World Wide Web|Web]].&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Nihad, and Hijazi, Rami. [https://books.google.com/books?id=U-AqDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;ots=4B1eKQe1p3&amp;dq=exif%20romoval&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Digital Privacy and Security Using Windows: A Practical Guide'']. Apress, 2017, pp. 56-59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawpro.ca/LawPRO/metadata.pdf The Many Faces of Fraud], ''LAWPRO  Magazine'', June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Metadata removal tools are also commonly used to reduce the overall sizes of files, particularly image files posted on the Web. For example, a small image on a website, which may contain metadata including a [[thumbnail|thumbnail image]], can easily contain as much metadata as image data, thus removal of that metadata can halve the file size.

Metadata can be found in many types of files such as [[document]]s, [[spreadsheet]]s, [[presentation]]s, [[image]]s, and [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] files. They can include information such as details on the file authors, file creation and modification dates, location (GPS), document revision history, thumbnail images and comments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elearningexamples.com/a-guardian-guide-to-your-metadata-interactive-graphic/ A Guardian Guide to Your Metadata], ''Interactive Graphic''&lt;/ref&gt;

Since metadata is sometimes not clearly visible in authoring applications (depending on the application and its settings), there is a risk that the user will be unaware of its existence or will forget about it and, if the file is shared, private or confidential information will inadvertently be exposed. The purpose of metadata removal tools is to minimize the risk of such data leakage.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis O'Reilly. [https://www.cnet.com/how-to/remove-metadata-from-office-files-pdfs-and-images/ Remove metadata from Office files, PDFs, and images], [[CNET]], May 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The metadata removal tools that exist today can be divided into four groups:
* Integral metadata removal tools, which are included in some applications, like the ''Document Inspector'' in [[Microsoft Office 2007]].
* Batch metadata removal tools, which can process multiple files.
* E-mail client [[add-in]]s, which are designed to remove metadata from e-mail attachments just before they are sent.
* Server based systems, which are designed to automatically remove metadata at the network gateway.

A '''microapartment''', also known as a '''microflat''', is a one-room, self-contained living space, usually purpose built, designed to accommodate a sitting space, sleeping space, bathroom and [[kitchenette]] with 14–32 square metres (50–350 sq ft) Unlike a traditional [[studio flat]], residents may also have access to a communal kitchen, communal bathroom/shower, [[patio]] and [[roof garden]].

==Characteristics==
[[File:Small_room_-_interior.JPG|thumb|250px|Bedrooms in microapartments need to be tiny and may also serve as a living room.]]
The microapartments are often designed for [[futons]], or with [[Murphy bed|pull-down beds]], folding desks and tables, and extra-small or hidden appliances. They differ from [[bedsit]]s, the traditional British bed-sitting room, in that they are self-contained, with their own bathroom, toilet, and kitchenette.

Microapartments are becoming popular in urban centres in Europe, Japan, Hong Kong and North America, maximizing profits for developers and landlords and providing relatively low-priced accommodation.&lt;ref name=Christie&gt;{{cite news |first=Les |last=Christie |url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/21/real_estate/micro-apartments/index.html |title=Micro-apartments: The anti-McMansions |work=CNN Money |date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lauren |last=O'Neill |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2012/11/san-francisco-approves-220-square-foot-micro-apartments.html |title=Would you live in a 220-square-foot 'micro apartment?' |work=CBC News |date=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Rome]], where the average price of property in 2010 was $7,800 per square metre (10.7 square feet), microapartments as small as 4 square metres (45 square feet) have been advertised.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Day |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/tight-fit-for-romes-microapartments-7447396.html |title=Tight fit for Rome's 'micro-apartments' |work=The Independent |date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries==
===Hong Kong===
[[Gary Chang (architect)|Gary Chang]], an architect in [[Hong Kong]], has designed a large 32-square-metre (344 sq ft) microapartment with sliding walls attached to tracks on the ceiling. By moving the walls around, and using built-in folding furniture and worktops, he can convert the space into 24 different rooms, including a kitchen, library, laundry room, dining room, bar and video-game room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Virginia |last=Gardiner |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/garden/15hongkong.html |title=24 Rooms Tucked Into One |work=The New York Times |date=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hong Kong, developers are embracing the micro-living trend, renting microapartments at sky-high prices. The ''Wall Street Journal'' compares the 180-square-feet flat in High Place, [[Sai Ying Pun]] to the size of a U.S. parking spot (160 square feet) in a video, highlighting the soaring property prices in Hong Kong (one of the apartments in High Place was sold for more than US$500,000 in June 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Steger |first=Isabella |date=2 June 2015 |title=In Hong Kong, the Apartments Are Fit for a Mosquito |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-hong-kong-the-apartments-are-fit-for-a-mosquito-1433237582 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |location=New York City |access-date=21 June 2016 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USA===
In January 2013, New York City got its first microapartment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= New York City "micro" apartments aim to be cosy, not cramped |first= Jonathan |last= Allen |work= [[Reuters]] |date= 10 July 2012 |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/10/uk-usa-newyork-apartments-idUSLNE86900Z20120710 }}&lt;/ref&gt; building, with 55 units that are as small as {{convert|250|sqft}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Manhattan to Get First 'Micro-Unit' Apartment Building |first= Oshrat |last= Carmiel |date= 22 January 2013 |work= [[Bloomberg News]] |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-22/new-york-city-to-get-first-micro-unit-apartment-building.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ceilings from {{convert|9|to|10|ft|spell=in}}.

Boston's first microapartment building opened in August 2016, at 1047 Commonwealth Avenue in [[Packard's Corner]].  As the largest microapartment building in the United States, the building is currently being leased by Boston University to house 341 students during the renovation of another university residence.  The building contains 180 units that each contain a bathroom with stand-up shower; a kitchen with all stainless-steel appliances that include an oven, a microwave, a dishwasher, and a refrigerator. Each unit also includes a stand up washer-dryer unit. Other amenities include an optional parking garage and indoor bike room in the basement, currently unused retail space, a lounge space, a rooftop penthouse, a deck overlooking the [[Allston]] neighbors, and an entertainment room that will be converted to a fitness center at the end of the University's tenure at the property, which is anticipated to be in 2018.

In the United States, most cities have zoning codes that set the minimum size for a housing unit (often 400 square feet) as well as the number of non-related persons who can live together in one unit. &lt;ref name=Bring_back_boarding_house&gt;{{cite news | last=Badger | first=Emily | title=Is It Time to Bring Back the Boarding House? | url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2013/07/it-time-bring-back-boarding-house/6236/ | access-date=2017-11-13 | publisher=CityLab - The Atlantic Monthly Group | date=2013-07-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114022002/https://www.citylab.com/equity/2013/07/it-time-bring-back-boarding-house/6236/ | archive-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a backlash in some cities against the increasing number of microapartments. In [[Seattle]], some residents have complained that [[Urban density|high-density]] microhousing changes the character of neighbourhoods, suddenly increasing demand for parking spaces and other amenities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hickman |first=Matt |url=http://www.mnn.com/your-home/remodeling-design/blogs/micro-apartments-met-with-nimbyist-sentiment-in-seattle |title=Micro-apartments met with NIMBYist sentiment in Seattle |work=Mother Nature Network |date=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lynn |last=Thompson |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2020845443_apodmentscitycouncilxml.html  |title=Critics of micro-apartments calling for a moratorium |work=Seattle Times |date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK===
In the UK, property developers are using office-to-residential permitted development rights, a policy introduced in 2013, to transform old office buildings into microapartment developments. The nationally described space standard stipulates that new homes in the UK cannot be smaller than 37sqm; however, this does not apply to conversions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rupert |last=Jones |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/feb/11/welcome-rabbit-hutch-britain-land-ever-shrinking-home |title=Welcome to rabbit-hutch Britain, land of the ever-shrinking home |date=11 February 2017 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; London-based developer Inspired Homes has taken advantage of office-to-residential permitted development rights to deliver over 400 microapartments. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Gordon |url=https://www.metro.news/the-micro-apartment-may-be-a-trend-thats-here-to-stay/558705/ |title=The micro apartment may be a trend that’s here to stay |date=4 April 2017 |work=Metro News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A micro-property in the UK has no strict definition but typically refers to properties with a floor area below 37sqm. ''Which?'' magazine reported that almost 8,000 new micro-homes were built in 2016, the highest number on record. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.which.co.uk/news/2017/08/the-30-sqm-squeeze-would-you-buy-a-micro-home/ |title=The 30 sqm squeeze: would you buy a ‘micro-home’? |date=19 August 2017 |last=Calver |first=Tom |work=[[Which?]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2017, the largest microapartment building in the world is The Collective Old Oak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mairs |first1=Jessica |title=World's largest co-living complex promises residents "everything at their fingertips" |url=https://www.dezeen.com/2016/04/28/collective-old-oak-common-co-living-plp-architecture-willesden-junction-london-housing/ |website=Dezeen |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which opened in London on May 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside London’s Largest Co-Living Development |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-londons-largest-co-living-development-1478794347 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by [[PLP Architecture]], the development has 546 rooms with most units grouped into "twodios" – two en-suite bedrooms that share a small kitchenette. There are also some private suites. The units sizes range from {{convert|9.2|sqm}} for an ensuite rooms with a {{convert|5.8|sqm}} shared kitchenette, to {{convert|12|sqm}} for a shared ensuite and {{convert|16.5|sqm}} shared ensuite with kitchenette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Co-Living FAQ|url=https://www.thecollective.co.uk/coliving/faq|website=The Collective|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each floor features one larger kitchen with a dining table, which is shared between 30 and 70 residents, and themed communal living spaces such as a games room, a cinema, a 'disco-launderette', a hidden garden and a spa. A restaurant, gym and co-working spaces are located in the lower floors of the building.

===Germany===
In 2017, the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'' reported there are about 25,000 micro-apartments in the country, and several thousand more are set to be built by the end of 2018. The projects will receive state support: the federal government plans to invest €120M in the micro-apartment market expansion. The market of micro-apartment targets over 30 million people, including students, singles and tenants whose primary places of residence are far from the big cities they work in. In Germany, tenants traditionally face considerable obstacles when trying to rent for anything less than the long-term — such as the obligation to pay a security deposit equal to three months’ rent and heightened credit history scrutiny. To the contrary, micro-apartments tend to cater to short- to medium-term renters. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Micro-apartments:the hottest new trend sweeping the German real estate market|url=https://tranio.com/germany/analytics/micro-apartments-the-hottest-new-trend-sweeping-the-german-real-estate-market_5245/|website=Tranio|date=21 December 2016 |first1=Elena |last1=Milishenkova |first2=George |last2=Kachmazov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pros and cons==
Although some prefer to live in microapartments, others only temporarily live in microapartments due to economic reasons, and would move to a larger house or apartment if they could afford to do so.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Susan Saegert, a professor of environmental psychology at the CUNY Graduate Center was quoted with her opinion on microapartments, “I’ve studied children in crowded apartments and low-income housing a lot,” Saegert said, “and they can end up becoming withdrawn, and have trouble studying and concentrating.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/the-health-risks-of-small-apartments/282150/ |title=The Health Risks of Small Apartments |first=Jacoba |last=Urist |date=19 December 2013 |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small size of a microapartment can be an issue, as its confined nature may permit strong odors to linger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tempest |first=Jean |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/realestate/what-no-one-ever-tells-you-about-tiny-homes.html |title=What no one ever tells you about tiny homes |work=New York Times |date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Polyglotta Africana''''' is an 1854 study by the German missionary [[Sigismund Wilhelm Koelle]], in which the author compares 156 [[African languages]] (or about 120 according to today's classification; several varieties considered distinct by Koelle were later shown to belong to the same language). As a comparative study it was a major breakthrough at the time. 

Koelle based his material on first hand observations, mostly with freed slaves in [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]]. He transcribed the data using a uniform [[Phonetics|phonetic]] script devised by the [[Egyptologist]] [[Karl Richard Lepsius]]. Koelle's transcriptions were not always accurate; for example, he persistently confused {{IPA|[s]}} with {{IPA|[z]}} and {{IPA|[tʃ]}} with {{IPA|[dʒ]}}. His data were consistent enough, however, to enable groupings of languages based on vocabulary resemblances. Notably, the groups which he set up correspond in a number of cases to modern groups: 
*North-West Atlantic &amp;mdash; [[Atlantic languages|Atlantic]]
*North-Western High Sudan/Mandenga &amp;mdash; [[Mande languages|Mande]]
*North-Eastern High Sudan &amp;mdash; [[Gur languages|Gur]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2658">'''Proparoxytone''' ({{lang-el|προπαροξύτονος}}, ''{{transl|el|proparoxýtonos}}'') is a [[linguistics|linguistic]] term for a word with stress on the [[antepenultimate]] (third last) syllable such as the [[English language|English]] words "cinema" and "operational". Related terms are [[paroxytone]] (stress on the penultimate syllable) and [[oxytone]] (accented on the last one).

In English, most nouns of three or more syllables are proparoxytones, except in words ending in –tion or –sion that tend to be paroxytones (ope'''ra'''tion, equivo'''ca'''tion, tele'''vi'''sion). This tendency is so strong in English that it frequently leads to the stress moving to a different part of the root in order to preserve an antepenultimate stress. For example, the root ph'''o'''tograph gives rise to the nouns phot'''o'''graphy and phot'''o'''grapher, ''f'''a'''mily'' → ''fam'''i'''liar''.

In medieval Latin lyric poetry, a ''proparoxytonic'' line or half-line is one where the antepenultimate syllable is stressed, as in the first half of the verse "Estuans intrinsecus || ira vehementi."

== Mentions in Literature ==
[[Ernst Robert Curtius]] offers an interesting use of the term in a footnote (Ch. 8, n. 33) of his ''European Literature in the Latin Middle Ages''. He is commenting on this passage from [[Smaragdus of Saint-Mihiel]]'s didactic poem on grammar:

:''Partibus inferior jacet interiectio cunctis''
:''Ultima namque sedet et sine laude manet.''

Here is Curtius' note:

&lt;small&gt;"Sad is the lot of the interjection, for of all the parts of speech it has the lowest place. There is none to praise it." On the way from Latin to French, the penultimate syllable of the proparoxytone succumbed. Mallarmé was so touched by this that he wrote a [[prose poem]] on the "Death of the Penultimate" (''Le Démon de l'analogie'' in ''Divagations''). It ends: Je m'enfuis, bizarre, personne condamnée à porter probablement le deuil de l'explicable Penultième." &lt;/small&gt; (''Eerie, I flee: likely some(no-)one doomed to wear weeds for the explainable second-last.'')

&lt;!-- Stephan Dedalus in [[James Joyce]]'s [[Ulysses (novel)]] uses the term to comment on the time being eleven o'clock, with eleven being a proparoxytone:

:"Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next, Lessing says." &lt;ref&gt;Joyce, James.  ''Ulysses.''  Vintage Books: New york. 1990.  Page 559.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

ROBOTY is also the first [[autonomous robot]] in [[Yemen]], all of which will be primarily controlled by [[voice command]]s. The final goal of this research project is to build a robot capable of playing [[chess]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahloul, Hamdi M.

ROBOTY was first introduced on October 21, 2010 by its inventor, Hamdi M. Sahloul, as his final year project. The seminar showed the components and capabilities of the robot. These capabilities included moving, speaking, hearing, facial recognition, and [[GPS]] navigation.&lt;ref&gt;"Student creates a robot which speaks Arabic", ''[[Saba News Agency]]'', Yemen, 22 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17298">The '''rule of faith''' ({{lang-la|'''regula fidei'''}}) is the name given to the ultimate authority or standard in religious belief. It was used by [[Early Christian]] writers as [[Tertullian]]. The phrase is sometimes used for early creeds.

==Meaning==
As a standard for adherence to [[orthodoxy]], rule of faith originally referred to the [[Old Roman Symbol]], which was an earlier and shorter version of the [[Apostles' Creed]] and other later statements of faith. As a historical standard for adherence to orthodoxy, rule of faith may also refer to other statements of faith including the [[Nicene Creed]], [[Athanasian Creed]], [[Augsburg Confession]], [[Articles of Dort]], [[Westminster Confession]] and others, the [[inner light]] of the spirit, as among [[Christian mysticism|mystics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Nuttall Encyclopædia/R#Rule of Faith|"Rule of Faith"]]. ''[[The Nuttall Encyclopædia]]'' (1907).&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule of faith is the name given to the ultimate authority or standard in religious belief, such as the [[Revelation|Word of God]] (''Dei verbum'') as contained in Scripture and [[Sacred tradition|Apostolic Tradition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = New advent |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05766b.htm |title= The Rule of Faith |work= [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |accessdate= 2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as among [[Catholics]]; [[theoria]], as among the [[Eastern Orthodox]]; the ''[[Sola scriptura]]'' (Bible alone doctrine), as among some [[Protestants]]; the [[Wesleyan Quadrilateral]] of faith, which held that Scripture, tradition, reason, and experience, as among other Protestants; and [[reason]] alone, as among Rationalist philosophers.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

===Second century usage===
The original rule of faith in the Early Christian Church as [[Irenaeus]] knew it, included:{{Efn | text= Η μεν γαρ Εκκλησια, καιπερ καθ' ολης της οικουμενης εως περατων της γης διεσπαρμενη, παρα δε των Αποστολων, και των εκεινων μαθητων παραλαβουσα την εις ενα Θεον Πατερα παντοκρατορα, τον πεποιηκοτα τον ουρανον, και την γην, και τας θαλασσας, και παντα τα εν αυτοις, πιστιν· και εις Χριστον Ιησουν, τον υιον του Θεου, τον σαρκωθεντα υπερ της ημετερας σωτηριας· και εις Πνευμα αγιον, το δια των προφητων κεκηρυχος τας οικονομιας, και τας ελευσεις, και την εκ Παρθενου γεννησιν, και το παθος, και την εγερσιν εκ νεκρων, και την ενσαρκον εις τους ουρανους αναληψιν του ηγαπημενου Χριστου Ιησου του Κυριου ημων, και την εκ των ουρανων εν τη δοξη του Πατρος παρουσιαν αυτου επι το ανακεφαλαιωσασθαι τα παντα, και αναστησαι πασαν σαρκα πασης ανθρωποτητος, ινα Χριστω Ιησου τω Κυριω ημων, και Θεω, Και Σωτηρι, και Βασιλει, κατα την ευδοκιαν του Πατρος του αορατου, παν γονυ καμψη επουρανιων και επιγειων και καταχθονιων, και πασα γλωσσα εξομολογησηται αυτω, και κρισιν δικαιαν εν τοις πασι ποιησηται· τα μεν πνευματικα της πονηριας, και αγγελους τους παραβεβηκοτας, και εν αποστασια γεγονοτας, και τους ασεβεις, και αδικους, και ανομους, και βλασφημους των ανθρωπων εις το αιωνιον πυρ πεμψη· τοις δε δικαιοις, και οσιοις, και τας εντολας αυτου τετηρηκοσι, και εν τη αγαπη αυτου διαμεμενηκοσι τοις μεν απ' αρχης, τοις δε εκ μετανοιας, ζωην χαρισαμενος αφθαρσιαν δωρησηται, και δοξαν αιωνιαν περιποηση. &lt;p&gt;The part before "in one God" can be translated "For the Church, spread throughout the whole world to the uttermost parts of the earth, having received from the Apostles, and their disciples, the faith ...". The part after "the whole human race" can be translated, "so that to Christ Jesus our Lord, and God, and Saviour, and King, according to the pleasure of the invisible Father, every knee may bow of those in the heavenly places and those on earth and those under the earth, and every tongue may confess to him, and he may do righteous judgement among all; and send the spirits of wickedness, and transgressing angels, and those who are in apostasy, and the impious, and unrighteous, and lawless, and blasphemous among men to eternal fire; but to the righteous, and holy, and those who have kept his commandments, and have persevered in his love whether from the beginning or out of repentance, granting life he may graciously give incorruption, and may put them in possession of eternal glory." [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101074938950;view=1up;seq=296 Book 1, Chapter 2] }}
{{ Quote | author=Irenaeus|source=''[[Adversus Haereses]]'' | text= …this faith: in one God, the Father Almighty, who made the heaven and the earth and the seas and all the things that are in them; and in one Christ Jesus, the Son of God, who was made flesh for our salvation; and in the Holy Spirit, who made known through the prophets the plan of salvation, and the coming, and the birth from a virgin, and the passion, and the resurrection from the dead, and the bodily ascension into heaven of the beloved Christ Jesus, our Lord, and his future appearing from heaven in the glory of the Father to sum up all things and to raise anew all flesh of the whole human race…}}

===Third century usage===
[[Tertullian]] uses the phrases "rule of faith" and "rule of truth" in ''On Prescription Against Heretics'':
{{Quote|Let our "seeking," therefore be in that which is our own, and from those who are our own, and concerning that which is our own, – that, and only that, which can become an object of inquiry without impairing the rule of faith.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''On Prescription Against Heretics'', 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | chapter = 13 | title = Ante-Nicene Fathers | volume = 3 | editor1-last = Roberts | editor2-last = Donaldson | year = 1976 | page = 249}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Catholic usage===
[[Pope Pius XII]] in [[Humani generis]] uses the term ''analogy of faith'' to say that Holy Scripture should be interpreted according to the mind of the Church, not that the teaching of the Church and Fathers should be interpreted by some theorised norm of the Scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Humani generis |url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Bible]] and [[sacred tradition]] (that is, things believed to have been taught by [[Jesus]] and the [[Twelve apostles|apostles]] that were not recorded in the Bible but were transmitted through the church) are considered a rule for all believers for judging faith and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hodge | first = Charles | chapter-url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology1.iii.v.i.html | chapter = 5. Roman Catholic Doctrine Concerning the Rule of Faith | author-link = Charles Hodge | publisher = CCEL | title = Systematic Theology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] says, "all that has been said about the manner of interpreting Scripture is ultimately subject to the judgement of the Church which exercises the divinely conferred commission and ministry of watching over and interpreting the Word of God&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = The Vatican | url = http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PQ.HTM | title = Catechism of the Catholic Church, Chapter 2 | at = art. 3 Sacred Scripture, ''III. The Holy Spirit, interpreter of Scripture''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010125111100/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm|archivedate=2001-01-25|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Baltimore Catechism]] used the phrase "rule of faith":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Baltimore Catechism | url=http://www.baltimore-catechism.com/lesson12.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ Quote | text = Q. 561. Must we ourselves seek in the Scriptures and traditions for what we are to believe? 

A. We ourselves need not seek in the Scriptures and traditions for what we are to believe. God has appointed the Church to be our guide to salvation and we must accept its teaching us our infallible ''rule of faith.}} In [[Verbum Domini]] (2010), Pope [[Benedict XVI]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;The Latin can be found on page 15 [https://web.archive.org/web/20101116170156/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20100930_verbum-domini_lt.pdf here].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote |...while in the Church we greatly venerate the sacred Scriptures, the Christian faith is not a 'religion of the book': Christianity is the 'religion of the word of God,' not of 'a written and mute word, but of the incarnate and living Word' (qtd. from St. Bernard of Clairvaux). Consequently the Scripture is to be proclaimed, heard, read, received and experienced as the word of God, in the stream of the apostolic Tradition from which it is inseparable}}

===Protestant usage===
In some [[Protestant theology]], it is a [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] rule of interpreting scripture by the understanding that scripture is to interpret scripture (''Sacra Scriptura sui interpres'': sacred Scripture is its own interpreter). It is an understanding that enforces the Bible as the inspired Word of God, and it is therefore consistent and coherent since God cannot contradict himself.&lt;ref&gt;Sproul, R. C., et al. Knowing Scripture. vol. Revised edition, IVP Books, 2009.

If a man's gift is prophesying, let him use it in proportion to his faith." (NIV, 1984)  The last phrase, "in proportion to his faith" is in Greek κατὰ ἀναλογίαν τῆς πίστεως ("analogy of faith"). In Romans 12:6 this refers to one of three possible ideas: the body of Christian teachings, the person's belief and response to the grace of God, or to the type of faith that can move mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Joseph | last = Fitzmyer | title = Romans | series = Anchor Bible Commentary | volume = 33 | place = New York | publisher = Doubleday | year = 1992 | pages = 647–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Protestantism]] Romans 12:6 is viewed as the biblical reference for the term "analogy of the faith" (i.e., αναλογἰα τῆς πἰστεως).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://documents.fuller.edu/ministry/berean/analogy.htm |title= Biblical Theology and the Analogy of Faith |work=Daniel Fuller|accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = John | last = Calvin | title = Institutes of the Christian Religion | chapter = Prefratory Address, 2 and Book IV, ch. 17, 32 | editor-first = John T | editor-last = McNeill | series = Library of Christian Classics, 2 vols | place = Philadelphia | publisher = Westminster Press | year = 1950 | at = 1:12; 2:1404}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Bible alone is considered the word of God and the only infallible standard for judging [[faith]] and practice;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hodge | first = Charles | chapter-url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology1.iii.vi.html | chapter = 6. The Protestant Rule of Faith | author-link = Charles Hodge | title = Systematic Theology | publisher = CCEL}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence, for conservative Protestantism, the ''analogy of the faith'' is equivalent to the ''analogy of scripture'' &amp;ndash; that is, opinions are tested for their consistency with scripture, and scripture is interpreted by the [[Holy Spirit]] speaking in scripture (compare ''[[sola scriptura]]'').

The analogy of faith, which was advanced by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], is sometimes contrasted with the analogy of being ({{lang-la|analogia entis}}), which, according to [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]], allows one to know [[God]] through analogy with his [[Creation myth|creation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/nature_grace.v.html#v-p10.1 Introduction] to ''Nature and Grace: Selections from the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas'', Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1954, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Orthodox usage ===
The [[Troparion]] for [[Saint Nicholas]] extols him as a rule of faith, a pastoral{{Efn | text= All who have reached glorification testify to the fact that "it is impossible to express God and even more impossible to conceive Him" because they know by their experience that there is no similarity whatsoever between the created and the uncreated.  God is "unmoved mover" and "moved" and "neither one". Nor oneness nor unity, nor divinity... nor sonship, nor fatherhood, etc." In the experience of glorification, the Bible and dogmas are guides to and abolished during glorification. They are not ends in themselves and have nothing to do with metaphysics, either with ''[[analogia entis]]'' or with ''[[analogia fidei]]''. This means that words and concepts which do not contradict the experience of glorification and which lead to purification and illumination of the heart and glorification are Orthodox. Words and concepts which contradict glorification and lead away from cure and perfection in Christ are heretical. This is the key to the decisions of all Seven Roman Ecumenical Councils as well as that of the Eighth of 879 and especially of the Ninth of 1341. Most historians of dogma do not see this because they believe the Fathers were, like [[Augustine]], searching by meditation and contemplation to understand the mystery of God behind words and concepts about Him.  They induct even such Fathers as [[Gregory the Theologian]] into the army of Latin theology by translating him to say that to philosophise about God is permitted only to "past masters of meditation," instead of "to those who have passed into [[theoria]]", which is vision of Christ "in a mirror dimly", by "kinds of tongues" and "face to face" in "glorification".&lt;p&gt;The Fathers never understood the formulation of dogma as part of an effort to intellectually understand the mystery of God and the incarnation. St. Gregory the Theologian ridicules such heretics: "Do tell me, he says, what is the unbegottenness of the Father, and I will explain to you the physiology of the generation of the Son and the procession of the Spirit, and we shall both of us be frenzy-stricken for prying into the mystery of God". Neither did the Fathers ever entertain the Augustinian notion that the Church understands the faith better with the passage of time. Every glorification is a participation in all the Truth of Pentecost, which can neither be added to nor better understood. This also means that Orthodox doctrine is purely pastoral since it does not exist outside the context of the cure of individual and social ills and perfection.  Being a theologian is first and foremost to be a specialist in the ways of the Devil. Illumination and especially glorification convey the charisma of the discernment of spirits for outwitting the Devil, especially when he resorts to teaching theology and spirituality to those slipping from his grip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Romanides | first = John S | title = Church Synods and Civilisation | author-mask = John S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4696">'''Saint Paul's Church''' is a former Greek Orthodox church in [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]], [[Mersin Province]], [[Turkey]].

== Tarsus and the churches ==
Tarsus, in the [[Cilicia]] of the [[ancient Near East|antiquity]], in what is now southern Turkey, was an important city during both ancient and medieval ages. The tombs of [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] of the Bible, and the [[caliph]] [[Al-Ma'mun]] (786-833), are both in Tarsus. [[Saint Paul]] was a resident of Tarsus. He was born and lived in Tarsus as a [[Jew]] named Saul and after converting, made a number of missionary journeys during which he was arrested and beheaded by emperor [[Nero]] of [[Roman Empire]] in AD 64 or 67 on the 29th of June.{{cn|date=June 2015}} After Saint Paul's death, Tarsus continued as an important city of the area. It became a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Abbasid Empire]], the [[Seljuk Empire]], the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], the [[Ramadanids]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

It is not known if there were any churches established by Paul in Tarsus, but in 1704, P. Lucas wrote that there was a Roman style church which had been built by Saint Paul. V. Langlois visited Tarsus in 1851 and confirmed this. In his words, thick walls which resembled Roman style windows which are narrower outside than inside, and thick columns are noticeable, but no other records exist to substantiate this claim.

Medieval Mersin's most important Christian sanctuary was the Armenian cathedral of Hagia Sophia, in which [[Leo I, King of Armenia|Leon I]] of [[Rubenid]] house was crowned by [[Conrad of Wittelsbach|Konrad Von Wittelsbach]], the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the representative of [[Pope]], as the king of Cilician Kingdom of Armenia in 1198.

== Saint Paul Church ==
[[File:Tarsus Saint Paul's Church.jpg|thumb|]]
According to tradition the building date of the Saint Paul Church is 1102, but the present structure, a domeless basilica, was built (or rebuilt) much later, in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Pocket Guide Mersin, MTSO,Ankara, pp 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance to its grounds is via an ornate gateway. The total area of the church building is 460 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The longer dimension of the building consists of face stone walls and blind vaults. The interior measures {{convert|19.30|x|17.50|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In the northeast corner stands an elevated belfry. The sides of the central nave window had been decorated by angels and landscape depictions. On the ceiling there are frescos of [[Jesus]] in the middle, and Matthew, Mark, Luke and John at the two sides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saintpaultarsus.com/html/saint_paul_church.html A page about the church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808111611/http://www.saintpaultarsus.com/html/saint_paul_church.html |date=2010-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoration ==
[[File:Saint Pauls Church interior.JPG|thumb|left|Interior of the church.]]
The church has been put under protection since 1993 and a restoration work has been carried on during 1998-2000 period. It is now under the protection of the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Ministry of Culture]] and officially known as Monumental Museum. &lt;ref&gt;''Mersin Ören yerleri,Kaleleri, Müzeleri'' {{ISBN|978-605-4196-07-4}} p.80&lt;/ref&gt; Although the church is open to religious services, because of the lack of community, regular services are not held; but ceremonies are held for groups of pilgrims. During Saint Pavlos year between 29 June 2008 and 29 June 2009, there was a number of special ceremonies and the closing ceremony of the year was held in Saint Paul's Church in Tarsus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anadolukatolikkilisesi.org/antakya/tr/programmi/2009-06-28.pdf Page of Anatolian Churches]&lt;/ref&gt;

The church and its surroundings are on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Turkey (Tentative list)|UN World Heritage Tentative List]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/state=tr Unesco list]&lt;/ref&gt;

:A bright and cheerful girl who is always excited to try new and exciting club activities. As result of a mental breakdown due to the zombie outbreak, Yuki has created an idealized delusion for herself, believing that everything is normal and her classmates and teachers are alive and well. Slowly, she realizes the truth of her surroundings, but still acts oblivious, though she will panic on occasions when her delusion breaks down and she sees reality for what it is. Since leaving the school, Yuki has slowly been coming to terms with reality and has tried to be of more use to the group.

She was formerly in love with an unnamed upperclassman, but when the zombie outbreak occurred, her crush was bitten and attacked her. She then used a shovel to kill him, which explains why it is her weapon of choice. After she becomes infected by being bitten on the right arm by the zombified Megumi, she is seemingly cured by an antidote. However, her body remains cold and she is ignored by other zombies, suggesting that the antidote didn't work properly. In later manga chapters, she is beginning to display zombie-like behavior though she still manages to retain her sense of self.

:Another teacher at Megurigaoka Private High School and one of Yuki's teachers. As a teacher, she was calm and kind; but due to Yuki often sleeping in class, she would get a little annoyed with her; though, she didn't get particularly angry, and only warned her that if she continued, she would have to stay after class. However, she did get angry when Yuki's friends would interrupt her classes. She was also very caring, and before the outbreak, she seemed to be on good terms with Megumi, which was proven when she decided to spend her last moments telling Megumi about the outbreak and not to let anyone come on to the rooftop.

:A student at Megurigaoka Private High School, and she was a close friend and classmate of Yuki prior to the outbreak. She had a calm demeanor, with a punk-like atmosphere surrounding her. Takae also seemed to have quite a playful personality, throwing paper planes at Yuki with a drawing of her depicted as an angel inside. She greatly cherished Yuki and was very affectionate with her, and she was also on good terms with her other two friends. Near the end of the series, Takae-(in her zombie form) was "listening" when Yuki spoke from the broadcasting room as she told the students who were still at the school that classes were over and that they could go home.

===St. Isidore University===
A university in the same town area as the School-Live club. It is one of the several designated facilities in the town with survival rations, solar panels, and an evacuation shelter. Following the outbreak, the surviving students at the school became divided, with some banding together to survive (the Circle) while others descended into anarchic survivalism (the Militants).

:The club president of the St. Isidore University's {{nihongo|Degeneracy Appreciation Society|自堕落同好会|Jidaraku Dōkō-kai}}, also known as the Circle, a small team of women who are at odds with some of the other students who are more focused on survival. She has a collection of video games and movies which she can play using the university's facilities. She makes an anime-original cameo in anime's final episode post-credits. She left the Militants when she disagreed with their strict methods. Unlike the Militants, she does not enforce body checks for signs of infection.

;{{nihongo|Aki Hikarizato|光里 晶|Hikarizato Aki}}
:Member of the Circle and like the most of its members, she was a former member of Militants until she left after having a glimpse of the thrilling pleasure that Ayaka took in the zombie apocalypse. She was a Liberal Arts Major before the outbreak.

;{{nihongo|Hikako Kirai|喜来 比嘉子|Kirai Hikako}}
:Repairman of the Circle, nicknamed Hika for short. She is quiet and kind, but was kicked out of the Militants after failing to kill a zombie by herself in fear, being deemed too weak to survive. She was an Engineering student and performs maintenance on the facilities that the Circle uses.

;{{nihongo|Rise Ryougawara|稜河原 理瀬|Ryougawara Rise}}
:The bookworm and librarian of the Circle, she often remains in the school library to read books due to her love of books and rarely leaves. She was also a Liberal Arts Major before the outbreak.

;{{nihongo|Takahito Tougo|頭護 貴人|Tōgo Takahito}}
:Leader of the Militants, the more survival-oriented combatant group of students at the university. He enforces body checks on all members of the club in order to eliminate the chance of a zombie infection among them. He is often seen with a negative outlook and expression because of the stress of surviving the outbreak. He uses a nail bat as a weapon. He is betrayed by Ayaka after he is infected, pushed into a horde of zombies and burned alive to cover her escape from the university.

;{{nihongo|Ayaka Kamimochi|神持 朱夏 |Kamimochi Ayaka}}
:One of the remaining female members of the Militants, she usually is calm and without obvious emotion but secretly takes great pleasure in killing zombies and people alike, as a means of having a fulfilling existence. She is adept at using a crossbow and knife as weapons. She kills Takahito to distract the zombies and escape the university, as she believes that she will have far more fun outside the walls of the college.

;{{nihongo|Shinou Uhara|(右原 篠生 |Uhara Shinō}}
:The other female member of the Militants, she has a side ponytail and is the main zombie exterminator of the group. She has a kind-hearted nature, but is efficient in exterminating zombies. She considers another member of the Militants, Kougami, as a precious person and has been hinted to be pregnant. She is adept with a variety of weapons, usually using a ice pick or a similar short weapon.

;{{nihongo|Renya Kougami|高上 聯弥|Kougami Renya}}
:Another member of the Militants.  Nicknamed Ren, he uses a crossbow and is Shinou's lover.

;{{nihongo|Takashige Shiroshita|城下 隆茂|Shiroshita Takashige}}
:Another member of the Militants.

:A [[Shiba Inu]] puppy that was found by Yuki and taken in as the School Living Club's mascot. However, because he was infected, the girls had to throw him away when he turned, but he still occasionally attempts to get into the clubroom due to his residual memories of the club. He has an expanded role in the anime version, having originally been found by Miki before they were both taken in by the club, but is later infected by Megumi. Although he is cured by the same vaccine given to Kurumi, he is left weak from the fight and later dies.

;{{nihongo|Radio DJ|ラジオDJ|Rajio Dī Jē}}
:A girl who broadcasts on a pirate radio station in the hopes of reaching out to any survivors. Unfortunately, she succumbs to her infection before the School Living Club are able to reach her. She does, however, live long enough to leave a note behind explaining to any survivors that come across her hideout to take the keys to the hideout and motorhome which the girls do.

;{{nihongo|Rū-chan|るーちゃん}}
:Yūri's little sister who is in elementary school. Yūri seemingly rescues her from the elementary school after the School Living Club leaves their own school. In reality, Rū is actually just Yuki's teddy bear that Yūri deluded herself into thinking is her sister similar to Yuki's delusions of Megumi. The others from St. Isidore University and the School Living Club, including Yuki, were simply playing along to keep Yūri happy and sane as they did for Yuki in the past. Yūri eventually comes to terms with Rū's death, giving the bear to Shinou for her baby.

Although the antidote manages to cure Kurumi of her condition, Tarōmaru is left weak from being infected for so long and dies in Miki's arms. After giving Tarōmaru a proper burial alongside Megumi, the girls learn that the reason he went down to the basement was to search for another puppy that was somewhere in the school. With the school no longer habitable due to the damage done to the electricity, the girls decide to head towards a university marked on a map by Megumi, holding a graduation ceremony to bid their farewells to the school. As the girls set off on their "graduation trip", another girl elsewhere comes across one of their letters.

'''Soft tyranny''' is an idea first coined by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in his 1835 work titled ''[[Democracy in America]]''.&lt;ref name=Tocqueville&gt;Alexis de Tocqueville, ''Democracy in America'' (New York: Bantam Books, 2000), 9-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, soft tyranny occurs whenever the social conditions of a particular [[community]] hinder any prospect of [[hope]] among its members.&lt;ref name=Tocqueville/&gt; For Tocqueville, hope is the driving force behind all democratic institutions.&lt;ref name=Tocqueville/&gt; As such, whenever this all-encompassing hope is taken away from the people, [[liberal democracy]] fails.

==Inciting rebellions==
Soft tyranny is often cited by historians as being the driving force behind many insurrections. The most obvious area in which soft tyranny affects people occurs with their fiscal situations. Price control is typically considered to be a common feature associated with [[communist]] societies; however, it relates directly to not only rebellion, but also soft tyranny. For example, when seigneurial rights, such as land [[taxes]] and byway [[toll road|tolls]], began to seriously irritate the French [[peasantry]] in the mid-eighteenth century, violence in the form of rioting emerged as a consequence.&lt;ref name=Markoff&gt;John Markoff, "Peasants and their Grievances," ''The Origins of the French Revolution,'' ed. Peter Campbell (New York: Palgrave-MacMillan, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|243}} In effect, the price of [[bread]], which was a [[Staple food|staple]] in the peasant [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], increased to the point where common peasants could not afford to purchase it on a daily basis.&lt;ref name=Markoff/&gt;{{rp|247}} And whenever people cannot feed themselves, havoc tends to ensue. This instance in mid-eighteenth century France exemplifies a form of soft tyranny which can quietly disrupt and eventually unravel an entire socio-economic order.

'''Sulloniacis''' or '''Sulloniacae''' is the name of a place in [[Roman Britain]] which is known only from an entry in the [[Antonine Itinerary]], a listing of routes and facilities for the [[cursus publicus]], the official courier service of the Roman Empire. ''Iter'' (Itinerary) II of the British section runs between [[Richborough]] (Portus Ritupis) and [[Chester]] (Deva), and this shows Sulloniacis on the road now known as [[Watling Street]], nine Roman miles from St Albans (Verulamium) and 12 from London. Sulloniacis is usually identified with Roman remains found at [[Brockley Hill]] near [[Edgware]] in the [[London Borough of Barnet]].&lt;ref name=Sheldon233&gt;{{cite book|title=Interpreting Roman London|editors=Bird, Joanna; Hassall, Mark; Sheldon; Harvey|chapter=In Search of Sulloniacis|first=Harvey|last=Sheldon|year=1996|publisher=Oxbow Books|page=233|isbn=1 900188 02 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the name==
The name may mean 'Estate of the family/descendants of Sullonios', Sullonios being a personal name which is not known from any other source.&lt;ref&gt;A.L.F. Rivet and Colin Smith, ''The place-names of Roman Britain''. London, 1979 (reprinted by Book Club Associates, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; However, it could refer to a geographical feature.&lt;ref name=Sheldon233/&gt;

==Other possible locations==
Archaeologist Harvey Sheldon has challenged the general assumption that the Roman site at Brockley Hill is Sulloniacis. Evidence has been found there of pottery production, but modern excavations have failed to produce any evidence of ''mutationes'' (stations for changing horses) or ''mansiones'' (accommodation for official travellers). Besides, although there are great difficulties in interpreting some of the mileages in the Itineraries, Brockley Hill does seem to be too far to the north. Sheldon suggested several alternative locations, particularly Red Hill, in the vicinity of the Bald Faced Stag in Burnt Oak Broadway. The [[Hendon and District Archaeological Society]] has found Roman remains nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon, pp. 233-241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APIT"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Hendon and District Archaeological Society|editor= Pamela Taylor|title=A Place In Time – The London Borough of Barnet up to c. 1500|year= 1989|isbn=0950305065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is however possible that all the possible locations were within the estate called ''Sulloniacis'', together with a possible Roman occupation site nearby on the hill at [[Hendon]].&lt;ref name="APIT"/&gt;

==Sulloniacis Pastures==
'''Sulloniacis Pastures''' is a 4.2 hectare [[Site of Nature Conservation Interest|Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation]], Grade II, located immediately south-east of the Brockley Hill archaeological site at [[british national grid reference system|Grid Ref]] {{gbmappingsmall|TQ176 940}}. The site is on grassland which slopes up eastwards from the [[A41 road]]. Located on [[London Clay]], it has many flowers typical of clay pasture, such as [[Lotus pedunculatus|greater bird's-foot-trefoil]] and [[Pimpinella saxifraga|burnet-saxifrage]].&lt;ref name=NCB&gt;{{cite book|title=Nature Conservation in Barnet|first=Jan|last =Hewlett|publisher=London Ecology Unit|year=1997|page=67|isbn=1 871045 27 4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program areas==
{{advert|date=July 2017}}

===Governance and law===
The Asia Foundation's largest program area – governance and law – develops and supports initiatives that build more effective and responsive governance in Asia. The Foundation cooperates with a broad network of partners in government, [[civil society]], and the private sector to improve governing institutions in order to help accelerate economic and social change, reduce corruption, manage conflict, and increase citizen participation.

Its sub-programming areas include:

* Governance (local/municipal governance, counter corruption, central executive institutions, parliamentary development, constitutional development)
* Law and Justice (strengthening and reform of formal and informal law and justice mechanisms, supporting efforts to increased community safety and security, particularly through community-oriented policing, and programs aimed specifically at empowering and protecting the rights of marginalized populations)
* Conflict and Fragile Conditions (subnational conflict, peacebuilding, and civil military relations) 
* Elections (free and fair elections and democratic practice, open flows of information, and political parties)

===Women's empowerment===
While women in Asia have made steady gains in recent years, gender inequality remains a significant problem. For 60 years, The Asia Foundation has supported women and girls across the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. Its Women's Empowerment Program was established in 1994 and has transformed the lives of thousands of women and girls through significant programs that focus on three key areas: expanding women's economic opportunities, increasing women's personal rights and security, and advancing women's political participation. The Foundation supports an integrated and coordinated approach that integrates gender into its work in governance, economic development, regional cooperation, and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usaid.gov/afghanistan/news-information/press-releases/more-afghan-women%E2%80%99s-empowerment&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development and aid effectiveness===
Development and aid effectiveness is a way through which the Asia Foundation brings together both their long standing and emerging donors and experts of development to have an exchange of ideas on how to best resolve key challenges in development; examples of this include the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid and Effectiveness and Asian Approaches to Development Cooperation. In these seminars and forums the Asia Foundation successful creates an open dialogue among the participants resulting in collaborative and cooperative approach to dealing with issues of development in Asia. A crucial element of this program is that it is brings together government official, policy makers, philanthropists all to one table—an approach missing from most NGOs who operate solely on implementing programs that their organizations initiate and support. Nina Merchant describes the role of Rigorous Impact analysis in the Foundations

===Economic development===
The Asia Foundation has a decades-long history of supporting broad-based economic growth across Asia through both public and private channels. The Foundation's Economic Development programs support Asian initiatives to enhance economic governance to accelerate and sustain inclusive economic growth and broaden economic opportunities through design and implementation in three core program areas: 1) improving the business environment for private sector growth, 2) advancing regional economic cooperation, and 3) supporting entrepreneurship development.

The Foundation works with local partners to design and implement program activities focusing on promoting investment and private enterprises, inclusive and equitable growth, empowering entrepreneurs and fostering intra and inter-regional trade by removing non-tariff barriers and strengthening domestic demand. From the sub-national level to regionally across borders, the Foundation is building coalitions for change that result in better business environments, job creation, and lasting change for individuals, families and communities.

Economic Development Impacts:

*The Asia Foundation has developed a powerful set of research tools, like the Economic Governance Indices (EGIs), Business Climate Barometers, and Regulatory Impact Assessments, which measure the quality of local business environments and the costs associated with poor policies. By identifying the strengths and weaknesses of business environments, local business owners and public officials are better able to identify and address specific areas for improvement. To date, the Foundation has developed EGIs in Bangladesh, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, and Indonesia.
*The Asia Foundation has facilitated multi-stakeholder public-private coalitions to address issues hindering economic and business growth, such as business forums to secure access to credit for entrepreneurs in Bangladesh, dialogues to simplify business licensing processes and reductions in local taxes and informal fees in Cambodia, and a regional forum to support Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) for regional integration in South-East Asia.

===Books for Asia===
[[File:National Library of Vietnam, Hanoi, Vietnam - 20131030-05.JPG|thumb|upright|A building used to store English books donated by the Asia Foundation at the [[National Library of Vietnam]]]]

Since 1954, Books for Asia has donated more than 40 million books to libraries in dozens of Asian countries, impacting the lives of millions of Asians. In 2006 alone, Books for Asia donated 920,000 books and educational materials valued at $30 million to schools and educational institutions in 15 countries. Books for Asia's donations help inspire Asia's students, citizens, and future leaders by enhancing English-language capacity, sharpening vocational and research skills, improving their knowledge about America, and giving the gift of enhanced literacy to children. The Asia Foundation's experienced local staff throughout Asia allows the Books for Asia program to work with librarians and educators to identify needs and appropriate materials, and to distribute requested books quickly and efficiently.

In 2005, Books for Asia's donations had a special focus on communities affected by the Asian tsunami in December 2004. Donations from publisher [[Scholastic, Inc.]], and a timely endorsement by the [[Association of American Publishers]], helped Books for Asia respond to the urgent need for books in schools and libraries in Sri Lanka and Thailand that were devastated by the disaster. As these communities rebuild, Books for Asia will continue to provide access to children's books, with a total of more than 300,000 reaching affected schools by the end of 2006.

==== Books for Asia in Timor Leste ====
"Books for Asia" is one of the many initiatives that have been put forth by TAF. Under this program, one million brand-new books are put into the hands of students, educators, and local and national leaders in 18 countries annually. The Asia Foundation recognizes that books change lives and help shape young people's imaginations, critical thinking skills, and their understanding of the world. Therefore, they are recognized as powerful tools to combat poverty and inspire positive, long-lasting change.

The main objective of the program is to provide access to information through reading materials, and cultivating a culture of reading and literature and linking people together in today's world. Under TAF, resources are made available for the people in Timor-Leste to enhance their mastery of English language; sharpen vocational and research skills, build knowledge in the business, legal and sciences professions. This enables people in Timor-Leste, regardless of their age, to equip themselves with more knowledge and skills through reading. This project also seeks to infuse children with an early love for reading, which is critical to increasing literacy rates.

Since TAF's founding in 1954, 45 million books, software programs and other educational materials have been donated to tens of thousands of learning institutions. Each year, the Asia Foundation in Timor-Leste receives brand new, high quality books donated by prominent publishers in the U.S. These books are catalogued and distributed to the recipients in Timor-Leste based on requests as well as through book drives.

The Mobile Library Program also consistently extends the Books for Asia program and its outreach to a bigger community in Timor-Leste. Extensions of the program are achieved through routine visits to schools, libraries and universities in Timor-Leste. These materials will eventually improve the quality of educational institutions currently available in Timor-Leste. 
Apart from the Books for Asia program, the Foundation also supports initiatives that spur literacy, promote understanding of democratic principles and strengthen civic participation. For example, the Foundation supported events jointly organized by Alieu Training and Resource Center (A resource center in the rural area of Timor-Leste) and the Ministry of Education that encourages children to continue schooling by recognizing the children's accomplishments in their education. In 2007, the resource center conducted a speech contest for school children in the Aileu District; and in 2008 and 2009, reading contests for school children was held for the children in Aileu District

Today, the Asia Foundation's Books for Asia program in Timor-Leste has distributed 9,942 books to more than 40 public, school, university and local NGO libraries as well as government agencies. More than 3,000 of the books are allocated toward book fairs to help increase awareness about the important role of reading.

===Exchanges===
Through its Asian American Exchange unit, The Asia Foundation seeks to encourage greater understanding between Asians and Americans with the ultimate aim of contributing toward strengthened U.S.-Asia relations. For over six decades, Foundation grants have provided thousands of participants with opportunities to exchange views, professional perspectives, and gain direct experience with regions other than their own through high-quality tailored fellowships, study tours, workshops, and other programs. Notable programs include:

*The Foundation's Asian Perspectives Series and Emerging Issues Series brought Asian civil society leaders and policymakers to Washington, D.C. to discuss vital issues across the region.
*The Foundation's [[Ellsworth Bunker]] Asian Ambassadors Series, also organized by the Foundation's Washington office, brought together ambassadors from Asia and select U.S. government, business, policy, and media leaders.
*The Asia Foundation also continued its 30-year partnership with the [[Henry Luce Foundation]] to administer an internship program for young Americans with leadership potential. Since 1974, the Asia Foundation has developed and overseen placements for more than 700 Luce Scholars in East and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;http://asiafoundation.org/program/overview/luce-scholars-program&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
The Asia Foundation's Environment program supports Asian initiatives to ensure the sustainability of the environment and natural resources critical to Asia's development and future well-being. The Foundation works with a broad range of local stakeholders including civil society, government, and the private sector to strengthen the institutions and processes through which environmental resources are managed, and to improve environmental policy.  Areas where the Foundation is having an impact in Asia include: advancing responsible mining and natural resource management in Mongolia; increasing public participation and transparency in environmental decision-making in China; and preparing for natural disasters and climate change in the Pacific Islands, among others.

===Regional cooperation===
The Asia Foundation's Regional Cooperation program works to strengthen relations among Asian nations and their peoples in the effort to foster peace, stability, prosperity, and effective governance. Its focus includes fostering regional cooperation on critical issues in Southeast, Northeast, and South Asia; foreign policy capacity-building in select countries in developing Asia; providing life-changing opportunities for emerging leaders in the region; and facilitating policy dialogues on Asian affairs and U.S.-Asian relations in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/tag/regional-cooperation/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317115756/http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/tag/regional-cooperation/ |archivedate=2015-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

"The Asia Foundation (TAF), a Central Intelligence Agency proprietary, was established in 1954 to undertake cultural and educational activities on behalf of the United States Government in ways not open to official U.S. agencies."&lt;ref name="US Department of State"&gt;{{cite web|title=Doc. 132: Memorandum from the Central Intelligence Agency to the 303 Committee|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v10/d132|website=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964–1968, Volume X, National Security Policy|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=2 September 2017|date=June 22, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asia Foundation is an outgrowth of the Committee for a Free Asia, which was founded by the U.S. government in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Routing and Record Sheet: Committee for a Free Asia|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DTPILLAR%20%20%20VOL.%201_0001.pdf|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIA funding and support of the Committee for a Free Asia and the Asia Foundation were assigned the CIA code name "Project DTPILLAR".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DTPILLAR|url=https://archive.org/details/DTPILLAR|website=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the Committee for a Free Asia was renamed the Asia Foundation (TAF) and incorporated in California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Congressional Research Service|title=The Asia Foundation: Past, Present and Future|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0001088617.pdf|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|date=February 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a private, nominally non-governmental organization devoted to promoting democracy, rule of law, and market-based development in post-war Asia.

Among the original founding officers of the board, there were several presidents/chairmen of large companies including T.S. Peterson, CEO of Standard Oil of California (now Chevron), Brayton Wilbur, president of Wilbur-Ellis Co., and J.D. Zellerbach, chairman of the Crown Zellerbach Corporation; four university presidents including Grayson Kirk from Columbia, J.E. Wallace Sterling of Stanford, and Raymond Allen from UCLA; prominent attorneys including Turner McBaine and A. Crawford Greene; Pulitzer Prize-winning writer James Michener; Paul Hoffman, the first administrator of the Marshall Plan in Europe; and several major figures in foreign affairs.

In 1966, Ramparts revealed that the CIA was covertly funding a number of organizations, including the Asia Foundation.&lt;ref name="US Department of State"/&gt; A commission authorized by President Johnson and led by Secretary of State Rusk determined that the Asia Foundation should be preserved and overtly funded by the US government. Following this change, the US government described the Asia Foundation as a "quasi-nongovernmental organizations" and said that "the core of its budget" was still provided by the US government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Congressional Research Service|title=The Asia Foundation: Past, Present and Future|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0001088617.pdf|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|date=February 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation began to restructure its programming, shifting away from its earlier goals of "building democratic institutions and encouraging the development of democratic leadership" toward an emphasis on Asian development as a whole (CRS 1983).

==Philanthropy==
In 2006, the Asia Foundation provided more than $53 million in program support and distributed 920,000 books and educational materials valued at $30 million throughout Asia.

'''Wally Wallington''' is a retired [[construction worker]] from [[Lapeer County, Michigan]], who has demonstrated methods for a single person to achieve the construction and manipulation of massive monoliths.  

==Work==
He has constructed a concrete [[Stonehenge]]-like structure using only materials and techniques that do not rely on any modern machine-powered technology. He has demonstrated this technique&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Web Site Shows Old Skills Moving Mountain Of Rock|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-6259563.html

==Technique==
His technique uses [[simple machine]]s such as [[lever]]s aided by [[counterweight]]s and pivots. He says that he has successfully singlehandedly "walked" a twenty-ton barn and multi-thousand-pound concrete blocks using a beam lever and two pivots beneath the object and near the center of mass. These techniques might be comparable to those used by [[Edward Leedskalnin]] when he had single-handedly constructed his massive [[Coral Castle]] in [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/history/060328_coral_castle.html|title=The Mysterious Coral Castle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''State of Washington and State of Minnesota v. Trump''''', 847 F.3d 1151 (9th Cir. 2017), was a lawsuit that challenged the lawfulness and [[United States Constitution|constitutionality]] of [[Executive Order 13769]], an executive order signed by U.S. President [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name="petition6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agportal-s3bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/Another/News/Press_Releases/Complaint%20as%20Filed.pdf|title=2:17-cv-00141 State of Washington v.

A few days after the order was signed, the state of Washington filed suit alleging that the executive order is unconstitutional because it, among other reasons, violates the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] guarantee of [[Due Process Clause|equal protection under the law]] because it was intended to harm and discriminate against their States' residents based upon their national origin or religion, and therefore it also violates the [[Establishment Clause]] because it was meant to "disfavor Islam and give preference to Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;([http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/02/04/17-35105%20motion.pdf Complaint 1] ¶ 41-52, January 30, 2017) ''Washington v. Trump'' (W.D.Wash.)&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government argued that the Constitution grants the [[President of the United States]]  "unreviewable authority" over immigration matters and that the non-citizens the executive order affects do not have [[due process]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 13, 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/02/04/17-35105%20motion.pdf Case: 17-35105 Motion for Emergency Stay]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 3, Judge [[James Robart]] issued a nationwide [[temporary restraining order]] which forbade the federal government from enforcing certain provisions of the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/ag-ferguson-obtains-court-order-halting-trump-immigration-action |title=AG FERGUSON OBTAINS COURT ORDER HALTING TRUMP IMMIGRATION ACTION |publisher=Washington State Office of the Attorney General |date=February 3, 2017 |accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government, in turn, filed an appeal with the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]. That court, however, denied the government's request to [[stay of proceedings|stay]] the temporary restraining order as the federal government failed to show it was likely to succeed at trial, thereby maintaining the prohibition on the government in enforcing the executive order.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/04/politics/doj-appeals-travel-ban-ruling/index.html|title=DOJ appealing travel ban ruling|author=Laura Jarrett|publisher=CNN|access-date=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/09/appeals-court-to-issue-decision-on-trump-travel-ban-later-today.html|title=US appeals court upholds suspension of Trump travel ban|first=|last=CNBC|date=February 9, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week later on January 27, he signed the executive order. Affected travelers immediately began filing legal challenges to the order through [[habeas corpus]] petitions and injunctive relief.

On January 30, 2017, the [[State of Washington]] &amp;mdash; represented by Washington State Attorney General [[Bob Ferguson (politician)|Bob Ferguson]], with the support of Washington Governor [[Jay Inslee]]&lt;ref&gt;Jim Brunner, [http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/ag-bob-ferguson-to-make-major-announcement-in-wake-of-trump-immigration-order/ AG Bob Ferguson files lawsuit — first by any state — to invalidate Trump's order], ''Seattle Times'' (January 31, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;filed a civil action in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington]], against Trump and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The state's suit asked the court for [[declaratory judgment|declaratory relief]] (a declaration that the executive order violates the Constitution) and [[Injunction|injunctive relief]] (to block enforcement of the executive order). The state also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, seeking an immediate halt to the executive order's implementation.&lt;ref name=washag/&gt; On February 1, 2017, an amended complaint was filed adding the [[State of Minnesota]] as a plaintiff alongside Washington.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/trump-executive-order-lawsuit-hearing-set-seattle-federal-court-friday TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER LAWSUIT: HEARING SET FOR SEATTLE FEDERAL COURT FRIDAY: Wash.

The Government argued that the federal courts do not have the authority to review executive actions regarding immigration because the Constitution gives the [[President of the United States]] "unreviewable authority" over immigration matters.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 13&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 3, 2017, Judge [[James Robart]] issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the enforcement of the executive order nationwide, and entered a temporary ban regarding immigration restrictions, then directed the parties to the action to file any briefs in support of a [[preliminary injunction]] by February 6, 2017.   White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement "At the earliest possible time, the Department of Justice intends to file an emergency stay of this outrageous order and defend the executive order of the President, which we believe is lawful and appropriate. The President's order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/03/politics/federal-judge-temporarily-halts-trump-travel-ban-nationwide-ag-says/index.html|title=Justice Department to challenge judge's halt of travel ban|first=Laura Jarrett, Eli Watkins and Rene Marsh|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2017/images/02/03/19717309322.pdf  2:17-cv-00141 Temporary Restraining Order ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-trumps-immigration-order-nationwide/2017/02/03/9b734e1c-ea54-11e6-bf6f-301b6b443624_story.html|title=Federal judge temporarily blocks Trump's entry order nationwide|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|author1=Matt Zapotosky|author2=Lori Aratani|author3=Justin Jouvenal|work=National Security|date=February 4, 2017|accessdate=February 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-idUSKBN15I1CM|title=Seattle judge blocks Trump's travel ban; White House to appeal|publisher=[[Reuters]]|author1=Dan Levine|author2=Scott Malone|date=February 4, 2017|accessdate=February 4, 2017|quote=For Trump's order to be constitutional, Robart said, it had to be "based in fact, as opposed to fiction."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spicer immediately issued an updated statement removing the word 'outrageous'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the proceedings, Judge Robart asked the federal government lawyer how many arrests of foreign nationals from the listed countries had occurred since 9/11. No numbers were offered by the defense and the judge incorrectly answered his own question by stating that none had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Eric. (February 6, 2017).

Trump responded by tweeting, "The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/827867311054974976|title=Donald J.

With each action testing the Constitution, and each personal attack on a judge, President Trump raises the bar even higher for [[Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court nomination|Judge Gorsuch's nomination to serve on the Supreme Cour]]t.

==Ninth Circuit proceedings==
[[File:Live audio from WA State v. Trump from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.webm|thumb|Oral argument before the 9th circuit.]]
On February 4, 2017, the United States filed an emergency motion in the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], seeking a stay of the District Court's temporary restraining order. In its request, the federal government contended that the temporary restraining order should be stayed because the judicial branch lacks the authority to review presidential actions over immigration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/02/04/17-35105%20motion.pdf 2:17-cv-00141 State of Washington v.

===Denial of stay===
On February 9, the three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit, in a [[per curiam decision]], unanimously denied the request for a stay of the temporary restraining order. The court, quoting the Supreme Court case ''[[Nken v. Holder]]'', made clear that "a stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result."&lt;ref name=9th18&gt;''Washington v. Trump'' No. 17-35105 (9th Circ.), slip op. at 18&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the court needed to answer four questions under ''Nken'', with the first two being most important: "(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceedings; and (4) where the public interest lies."&lt;ref&gt;''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 18 quoting {{ussc|name=Nken v. Holder|volume=556|page=418|pin=434|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=9th18 /&gt; The court denied the stay as they found the federal government failed to prove the first two questions, and that the last two tip in favor of the plaintiffs, Washington and Minnesota.

The court ruled that the federal government is unlikely to succeed on the merits against Washington's due process claim. Though the court discussed Washington State's contention that the executive order violates the [[First Amendment]] prohibition on religious discrimination, they withheld ruling on that claim, as being unlikely to succeed against a due process claim is sufficient to fail the first question. The federal government did not provide evidence or argument as to why the executive order needed to be enacted immediately and thus a stay required.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 26-27 ("Despite the district court's and our own repeated invitations to explain the urgent need for the Executive Order to be placed immediately into effect, the [Federal] Government submitted no evidence to rebut the States' argument that the district court's order merely returned the nation temporarily to the position it has occupied for many previous years.")&lt;/ref&gt; In showing the federal government was unlikely to succeed on the merits against a due process claim, the court argued that it showed the States and their citizens would be irreparably harmed by a stay as "the deprivation of constitutional rights 'unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 28, quoting {{ussc|name=Elrod v. Burns|volume=427|page=347|pin=373|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that "aspects of the public interest favor both sides", but that in light of the prior three questions, "these competing public inteterests do not justify a stay."&lt;ref&gt;''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''En banc'' proceedings ===
The day after the denial of stay, the 9th Circuit ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs on whether the motion should be reheard ''[[en banc]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/02/10/17-35105_Supplemental%20Briefing%20Order.pdf Supplemental briefing order], ''Washington v.

The parties were instructed to submit their briefs by February 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-court-idUSKBN15O2XS|title=Trump Weighs Revised Travel Ban, Supreme Court Test Still Possible|publisher=Reuters|date=February 10, 2017|access-date=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, the Trump administration asked to postpone further proceedings because they expected to replace executive order with a new one the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-says-hell-issue-a-new-executive-order-on-immigration-by-next-week/2017/02/16/4b65e7d6-f463-11e6-a9b0-ecee7ce475fc_story.html|title=Trump says he'll issue a new executive order on immigration by next week|last=Zapotosky|first=Matt|date=2017-02-16|website=Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the 9th Circuit issued an order on the same day staying the ''en banc'' review of its previous ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/02/16/17-35105_Stay%20Order%20revised.pdf Stay Order for En-Banc Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dismissal of the appeal ===
On March 6, 2017, President Trump issued [[Executive Order 13780]], which revoked and replaced Executive Order 13769 (at issue in this appeal). Two days later, on March 8, 2017, the government moved to dismiss the appeal as moot, which the Court granted the same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/03/08/Motion%20to%20Dismiss%20Voluntarily.pdf 17-35105 Motion to Dismiss Appeal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/03/08/17-35105%20-%20Order%20to%20Dismiss%20Granted.pdf 17-35105 Order Dismissing Appeal]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4279">'''Wembley's Parliament of Living Religions''' was part of the [[British Empire Exhibition]] of 1924, inviting famous representatives of important Living Religions within the British Empire. Although the Exhibition was held at [[Wembley Park]] in north-west [[London]] the Conference was held at the [[Imperial Institute]], between 22 September and 3 October 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3779&amp;context=ocj An Account of the Parliament of Living Religions, Wembley, London 1924]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of this and similar [[World Fair]]s go back to the early 18th century. Some of the more famous ones have been [[The Great Exhibition of 1851]] in London  and  [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in Chicago in 1893.

== Proposed Objectives ==

[[William Loftus Hare]] described the following ten objectives of such International Conferences.

# To bring together in conference, for the first time in history, the leading representatives of the great Historic Religions of the world.
# To show to men, in the most impressive way, what and how many important truths the various religions held and teach in common.
# To promote and deepen the spirit of human brotherhood among religious men of diverse faiths, through friendly conference and mutual good understanding, while not seeking to foster the temper of indifferentism, and not striving to achieve any formal and outward unity.
# To set forth, by those most competent to speak, what arc deemed the important distinctive truths held and taught by each religion, and by the various chief branches of Christendom.
# To indicate the impregnable foundations of theism and the reasons for man's faith in immortality, and thus to unite and strengthen the forces which are adverse to a materialistic philosophy of the universe.
# To secure from leading scholars, representing the Brahman. Buddhist, Confucian, Parsee. Mohammedan, Jewish and other faiths, and from representatives of the various churches of Christen- dom, full and accurate statements of the spiritual and other effects of the religions which they hold upon the literature, art, commerce, government, domestic and social life of the peoples among whom these faiths have prevailed.
# To inquire what light each religion has afforded, or may afford, to the other religions of the world.
# To set forth, for permanent record to be published to the world, an accurate and authoritative account of the present condition and outlook of religion among the leading nations of the earth.
# To discover, from competent men, what light religion has to throw on the great problems of the present age, especially the important questions connected with temperance, labor, education, wealth and poverty.
# To bring the nations of the earth into a more friendly fellowship, in the hope of securing permanent international peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3779&amp;context=ocj An Account of the Parliament of Living Religions, Wembley, London 1924]&lt;/ref&gt;
