[[File:Hammer-cross and Forest Spirits.jpg|thumb|400px|An artistic depiction of the [[Circassians|Circassian]] Hammer-cross, a symbol of Habze.]]
'''Adyghe Habze''' or '''Circassian Habze''' ([[Circassian language|Adyghe]]: Адыгэ Хабзэ /adəɣa xaːbza/), alternatively spelled '''Khabze''', '''Khabza''', or '''Xabze''', also called '''Habzism''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://sk-news.ru/news/raznoe/13640/ «Хабзисты». Кто они?]&lt;/ref&gt; is&lt;ref name="Khabze11051"&gt;Khabze.info.

The native philosophy was influenced by [[Religion in ancient Greece|Hellenic religion]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy|philosophy]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The belief system takes its name from the [[Circassians|Circassian]] epic [[nart saga (epic)|''Nart Saga'']],{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} originally orally transmitted, which has heavily contributed to the shaping of [[Circassians|Circassian]] values over the centuries. Although historically [[Christianisation|Christianised]] and [[Islamisation|Islamised]], the period of the [[Soviet Union]] contributed to a severe weakening of religions in the area, especially among the [[Circassians]]. During this time and after the fall of the [[Soviet]] regime, the revival of Habzist worldview was supported by [[Circassians|Circassian]] intellectuals, as part of a rise in [[nationalism]] and cultural identity in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Paul Golbe.

On ''Windows on Eurasia'', January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently as a thwarting force against [[Wahhabism]] and other [[Islamic fundamentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Авраам Шмулевич. ''Хабзэ против Ислама. Промежуточный манифест''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement has developed a following especially in [[Karachay-Cherkessia]] (12%) and [[Kabardino-Balkaria]] (3%), according to 2012 statistics.&lt;ref name="ArenaAtlas"&gt;[http://sreda.org/arena Arena - Atlas of Religions and Nationalities in Russia] • sreda.org&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners and advocates have faced radical Islamist persecution. 

On 29 December 2010, a prominent [[Kabarday|Kabard]]-Circassian ethnographer and Habze advocate, Arsen Tsipinov,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/docs/publications/110302analyst.pdf Central Asia-Caucasus Analyst] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707041612/http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/docs/publications/110302analyst.pdf |date=July 7, 2013 }}.

''Eurasia Daily Monitor'', volume 8, issue 1, 2011. ''Retrieved 24-09-2012''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 2018, a book about Habze (with focus on the code of conduct, code of honour, and traditions of the Circassian people) entitled '''الاديغة هابزة-العادات الشركسية''' or '''Адыгэ хабзэ''' (in Circassian) was released. It was written by Circassian language expert Zarema Madin Gutchetl and translated by Nancy Hatkh.

==Etymology==
"Habze" (Хабзэ) is an [[Circassian language|Circassian]] [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] made up from хы "khy", meaning "vast" or "universe", and бзэ "bze", meaning "speech", "word", "language".&lt;ref name="Khabze11047"&gt;Khabze.info. [http://habze.info/publ/what_is_khabze/1-1-0-47 What is Khabze?]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2018}} Thus, its meaning is roughly "language of the universe" or "word of the cosmos", comparable to the concept of ''[[Dharma]]''.

==Beliefs==
An important element is the belief in the soul (''psa'') of the ancestors, who have the ability to observe and evaluate the affairs of their offsprings.&lt;ref name="Khabze11051"/&gt; The concept of physical pain or pleasure in the Hereafter (''Hedryhe'') is absent: the soul is granted spiritual satisfaction or remorse for one's chosen path in life in front of himself and his ancestors.&lt;ref name="Khabze11051"/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2018}}

Therefore, the goal of man's earthly existence is the perfection of the soul, which corresponds to the maintenance of honour (''nape''), manifestation of compassion (''guschlegu''), gratuitous help (''psape''), which, along with valour, and bravery of a warrior, enables the human soul to join the soul of the ancestors with a clear conscience (''nape huzhkle'').&lt;ref name="Khabze11051"/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2018}} The souls of the ancestors require commemoration: funeral feasts are arranged (''hedeus'') and sacrifice or memorial meal preparations (''zheryme'') are practiced and distributed for the remembrance of the dead souls.&lt;ref name="Khabze11051"/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2018}}

'''Aleksei Fedorovich Losev''' ({{lang-ru|Алексе́й Фёдорович Ло́сев}}; September 23, 1893 – May 24, 1988) was a [[Russia]]n [[philosopher]], [[philologist]] and [[culturology|culturologist]], one of the most prominent figures in Russian philosophical and religious thought of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.transculturalstudies.com/article/view/311 |last=Takho-Godi |first=Elena A. |journal=Transcultural Studies |volume=4 |title=Aleksei Losev's Philosophical Novel 'The Woman Thinker' and the Problem of the Eternal Feminine |year=2008 |publisher=Charles Schlacks |location=Idyllwild, California |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630111343/http://www.transculturalstudies.com/article/view/311 |archivedate=2013-06-30 |df= }} Special Issue: Sophia Across Culture: From Old Testament to Postmodernity.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Losev was born in [[Novocherkassk]], the administrative center of the [[Don Host Oblast]], the far western Russian territory held by the [[Don Cossacks]] on the banks of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]]. He was named after his maternal grandfather, Aleksei Polyakov; a priest in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003&gt;{{cite book |last=Marchenkov |first=Vladimir Leonidovich |title=Aleksei Losev and His Theory of Myth |year=2003}} (The introduction to Marchenkov's English translation of ''The Dialectics of Myth'', {{ISBN|0203633733}})&lt;/ref&gt; Losev's paternal great-grandfather was also named Aleksei, and was awarded for heroism during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], while fighting in a Cossack Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kongord.ru/Index/Screst/sk137-10.htm |language=Russian |title=Monument to the Don Cossacks on the Arbat |first=Alexander |last=Shevchenko |work=Religion in Contemporary Society |publisher=Konstantin Gordeev |accessdate=May 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829175852/http://www.kongord.ru/Index/Screst/sk137-10.htm |archivedate=August 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Losev's father was Fyodor Petrovich Losev, a violinist and conductor by avocation and a teacher of mathematics and physics by trade. Attracted to a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle, Losev's father left the family in the hands of his wife, Natal'ya Alekseevna Loseva (née Polyakova), who raised Losev as an [[only child]] at her father's house.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt;

Losev was schooled in the [[classics]] at [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] from the age of ten. He was little interested in his studies until he was introduced to philosophy. As well, he became fascinated by astronomy after reading a book by [[Camille Flammarion]]. His early interest in music continued, and he considered a career as a violinist.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt;

In his final year of gymnasium, Losev received a gift from his professor: an eight-volume set of writings by Russian philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], which influenced him greatly. Losev entered [[Moscow University]] in 1911. He held season tickets to the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] where he watched every opera he could. During a study visit to Berlin, his luggage was stolen, including his books and all of his manuscripts. The trip was cut short by the start of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt;

==Career==
Losev graduated with a [[double degree]]—philology and philosophy—in 1915. He stayed at Moscow University to prepare for a position as lecturer in Classical Philology.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt; In 1916 he published his first paper, "Eros in Plato".&lt;ref name=Khoruzhii&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://synergia-isa.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/hor_losev.pdf |last=Khoruzhii |first=Sergei Sergeevich |title=A Rearguard Action |editor=M. E. Sharpe |year=2002 |volume=40 |number=3 |journal=Russian Studies in Philosophy |pages=30–68 }} English translator: Stephen Shenfield. First published in Russian in 1994 in ''Posle pereryva. Puti russkoi filosofii'' as "Ar'ergardnyi boi".&lt;/ref&gt; When Russia erupted in the 1917 [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution]]s, Losev kept a low profile, spending all of his time writing and studying. In 1919, [[typhus]] killed his mother. The same year, Losev's paper "Russian Philosophy" was published in a German-language volume composed of various articles about Russian cultural development. Losev was unaware of this publication until 1983. It was finally published in the Russian language after Losev's death.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt;

After the revolution, the [[Bolshevik]]s stopped the teaching of the classics at Moscow University. In 1919, Losev became a professor of classical philology at the newly opened [[N. I. Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod|University of Nizhni Novgorod]]. He also found work teaching [[aesthetics]] at the State Institute of Musical Science, at the State Academy of Artistic Science, and at the [[Moscow Conservatory]] where he was named professor.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt;

Losev married Valentina Mikhailovna Sokolova on June 5, 1922; she was a student of math and astronomy who was five years younger than Losev. He had seen her since 1917 when he began renting a room from her parents in Moscow.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt; [[Pavel Florensky]], a former priest and physicist working on the official [[GOELRO plan]] to bring electrical utility service to Russia, performed the wedding ceremony in [[Sergiyev Posad]]. Losev and his wife found they were matched artistically, intellectually and also spiritually; they both sought higher understanding in the study of Russian religion under [[Archimandrite]] David. [[Religion in the Soviet Union|Religion was being suppressed]] by the Bolsheviks, so this study was conducted in secret. On June 3, 1929, the two were ordained monks in the Russian Orthodox Church in a private ceremony officiated by David. They took the monastic names Andronik and Afanasiya. The Losevs successfully hid their monastic status from the public until five years after Losev's death in 1988.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt;

==Conflict with Communism==
Losev wrote eight monograph volumes, beginning the work in 1923.&lt;ref name=Khoruzhii/&gt; The titles were: ''The Ancient Cosmos and Modern Science'', ''The Philosophy of Name'', ''The Dialectics of Artistic Form'', ''The Dialectics of Number in Plotinus'', ''Criticism of Platonism by Aristotle'', ''Music as a Subject of Logic'', ''Essays on Classical Symbolism and Mythology'', and ''The Dialectics of Myth''.&lt;ref name=ISFP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isfp.co.uk/russian_thinkers/alexey_losev.html |title=Alexey Losev |work=Gallery of Russian Thinkers |last=Takho-Godi |first=Aza A. |editor=Dmitry Olshansky |editor2=Robert Barsky |editor3=Maryse Dennes |editor4=Geoffrey Klempner |editor5=John McCannon |editor6=Henrietta Mondry |publisher=International Society for Philosophers |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was to conclude with a ninth volume but ''The Dialectics of Myth'' caused a great deal of controversy, and Losev never finished the final monograph.&lt;ref name=Khoruzhii/&gt;

In these works, Losev synthesized the ideas of Russian philosophy of the early 20th century, of Christian [[Neo-platonism]], dialectics of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]]. In 1930's ''The Dialectics of Myth'', Losev rejected [[dialectical materialism]] and proposed that myth ([[idea]]) should be treated on equal terms with physical [[matter]].&lt;ref name=Khoruzhii/&gt;

''The Dialectics of Myth'' identified as false the constructs of the Soviet system; it pointed out the absurdity of the myths associated with state [[ideology]], and with the dogma of [[Communism]]. Soviet officials reacted quickly to suppress the book. On April 18, 1930, Losev was arrested and held in [[solitary confinement]] in the basement prison of the [[Lubyanka Building]]. His wife Valentina was arrested on June 5, 1930; the couple's eighth wedding anniversary. Marianna Gerasimova, an investigator with the [[Joint State Political Directorate]] (OGPU), an agency of secret police, was assigned to investigate Losev with the goal of proving that he was a leader of the secret religious splinter group called [[Onomatodoxy]], based on the idea that the [[Name of God]] is [[God]] Himself, and that Losev was involved in planning violence against the Soviet government. Losev was indeed associated with Onomatodoxy but his role was theological, not practical. Gerasimova led a team of investigators who gathered and fabricated evidence over the course of 17 months while Losev was held in prison. Gerasimova listed false claims against Losev such as his being a member of the [[Black Hundreds]], an [[antisemite]], and a religious bigot and fanatic. Losev's library and writings were seized, and his dwelling was lived in by an agent of OGPU.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt;

In the summer of 1930, the [[16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|16th Communist Congress]] met, and Losev's case was discussed. The book was denounced by politician [[Lazar Kaganovich]] and playwright [[:ru:Киршон, Владимир Михайлович|Vladimir Kirshon]] who said "for such nuances put him up against a wall" to be executed.&lt;ref name=Khoruzhii/&gt; All 500 copies of the book were seized and destroyed.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt; After 4 months in Lubyanka, Losev was transferred to [[Butyrka prison|Butyrskaia Prison]] where he was held for 13 more months. The Losevs were sentenced for his "militant idealism": Valentina to five years and Aleksei to ten years of hard labor in Northern Siberia. Losev was sent to [[Gulag]] [[labor camp]]s to work on the construction of the [[White Sea – Baltic Canal]].&lt;ref name=ISFP/&gt; Initially, he was put to work hauling timber, but his health failed and he was assigned night watchman at a timber storage facility.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt; There he began to gradually lose his vision due to malnutrition,&lt;ref name=Khoruzhii/&gt; though he was reunited with his wife in 1932 at Belbaltlag labor camp.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt; In December 1931, [[Maxim Gorky]] wrote acidly in ''[[Pravda]]'' and in ''[[Izvestia]]'' that he regretted Losev was still alive to foul the Soviet air.&lt;ref name=Khoruzhii/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seifrid |first=Thomas |title=The Word Made Self: Russian Writings on Language, 1860–1930 |page=168 |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0801443164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, it was Gorky's first wife who obtained Losev's release from Gulag. [[Yekaterina Peshkova]], formerly an activist with the [[Political Red Cross]] and in the 1930s the chair of the follow-on group Assistance to Political Prisoners, worked to free Losev, finally succeeding in late 1932 to overturn his conviction.&lt;ref name=Khoruzhii/&gt;

==Post-arrest career==
After returning to Moscow in mid-1933, Losev was allowed to pursue his academic career and to teach. [[Ancient philosophy]], [[idea|myth]] and [[aesthetics]] became his "inner exile": he was able to express his own spiritualist beliefs.

Losev had been very admiring of the famous pianist [[Maria Yudina]]. He had met with her at his Moscow home in early April 1930, prior to a concert she performed on April 16.&lt;ref name=Word2009&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.portal-slovo.ru/philology/40392.php |script-title=ru:Глава первая. Основные этапы творчества А.Ф. Лосева |last=Takho-Godi |first=Elena A. |date=January 31, 2009 |journal=Слово |language=Russian }} (''Word'' magazine, article title "The art of A.F. Losev's prose")&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, Losev was arrested because of his book ''The Dialectics of Myth''. When he returned home in 1933, he wrote a novel using Yudina as the model: ''Woman as Thinker'', or ''The Woman Thinker''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vitebsk: the life of art |first=Aleksandra Semënovna |last=Šatskih |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2007 |isbn=0300101082 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cg4kkYvTKw4C&amp;pg=PA308 |page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flawed heroine Losev created, Maria Valentinovna Radina, was a woman musician who spouted high-minded philosophy but slipped to lower standards in her personal life. The novel has been criticized as an outlet for Losev's difficult relationship with Yudina, and as a poor example of his capabilities as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Booker Winners and Others |page=227 |first1=Natalii͡a |last1=Perova |first2=A. L. |last2=Tait |year=1994 |publisher=Russlit |isbn=0939010437 |volume=7 |series=Glas new Russian writing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yudina disliked the character of Maria which she recognized as herself, and in early 1934 she broke with Losev, never to see him again.&lt;ref name=Word2009/&gt;

During the 1930s, Losev composed what he intended to be a definitive work on classic aesthetics, titled ''A History of Ancient Aesthetics''. The manuscript was lost along with everything else in his Moscow apartment when it was hit by a German bomb in 1941.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt; In 1943, Losev was awarded a doctorate degree in the classics ''[[Honorary degree|honoris causa]]'': from the mass of work previously accomplished. From 1942 to 1944, Losev taught at Moscow University and from 1944 on at the [[Moscow State Pedagogical University]]. Also in 1944, the Losevs brought a young post-graduate student into their home—Aza Alibekovna Takho-Godi—who continued in her studies of classical philology. Both the Losevs grew fond of Takho-Godi; when Valentina died from cancer on January 29, 1954, it was with her blessing that Losev and Takho-Godi would join in marriage. Takho-Godi became Losev's second wife and eventually his widow.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt;

Losev published some 30 monographs between the 1950s and 1970s. With regards to Western philosophy of the time, Losev criticized severely the [[Structuralism|structuralist]] thinking.

In the USSR, his works were censored while he was praised as one of the greatest philosophers of the time. He was even awarded the [[USSR State Prize]] in 1986 for his eight-volume ''History of Classical Aesthetics'', two years before his death.

==Controversy==
{{undue section|date=April 2018}}
In 1996, a short-lived controversy arose when author [[Konstantin Polivanov]], Jewish studies historian [[Leonid Katsis]], and journalist Dmitrii Shusharin published three articles that described Losev as an [[Antisemitism|antisemite]] who bargained with [[Joseph Stalin]] for his release from exile. According to translator Vladimir Leonidovich Marchenkov these three articles appearing in Russian newspaper Segodnya were a coordinated series of accusations.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt; Katsis compared Losev's supposed relationship with Stalin to the relationship between [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], with Rosenberg helping to shape Hitler's ideology.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt; Olesya Nikolaeva responded to deny this assertion in the Russian Orthodox newspaper ''Radonezh'': "The logic of the Bolshevist secret police" (1996). Losev's widow Aza Alibekovna Takho-Godi wrote a rebuttal of the claims in the magazine ''[[Russkaya Mysl]]''; to disprove the assertions she printed letters written by Losev to the state censors. The popular science magazine ''[[Rodina (magazine)|Rodina]]'' moved to settle the matter by publishing materials from the 1930–31 [[OGPU]] case file, which for the first time publicly demonstrated how Soviet secret police fabricated evidence against Losev.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt;

Swiss Slavicist [[Felix Philipp Ingold]] followed with "''Zerbrechende Mythen''" ("Crumbling myths") in 1996, in support of the idea that Losev was antisemitic.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt; Professor Alexander Haardt of [[Ruhr University Bochum]] responded to Ingold by defending Losev's reputation. Haardt said that Losev's legacy should not be smeared by a few words but judged by the whole of his life's work. He said the antisemitic statements listed in Gerasimova's politically motivated investigation from 1930–31 could not be trusted as originating from Losev. Losev's defenders characterized him as a principled critic of all religions including Protestantism, Judaism, and his own orthodoxy, and said that he was never anti-Jew. He was also said to be in approval of Communist totalitarianism even while he freely criticized the emptiness of Communist ideology. Russian philosopher [[Leonid Stolovich]] wrote very strongly against those who called Losev an antisemite, the article titled "Losev should not be handed over as a gift to the Black Hundred followers!"&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt; He said that mitigating documents that should have been included in the OGPU investigation case files appeared to be missing, likely because they did not support the antisemitic conclusions.&lt;ref name=Marchenkov2003/&gt; In 1999, Katsis re-examined the issue in light of the letters and files published in late 1996. He found the issue to be more nuanced than he previously thought, and agreed that "all attempts to distort" Losev's legacy were "politically motivated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Logos |title=AF Losev, VS Soloviev, Maxim Gorky: A retrospective view of 1999 |last=Katsis |first=Leonid |date=April 1999 |number=14 |pages=68–95 |url=http://www.ruthenia.ru/logos/number/1999_04/1999_4_06.htm |language=Russian |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrzej Głowacki''' – European [[philosopher]], [[designer]], [[graphic artist]], [[professor]]  of Academy Of Fine Art in [[Cracow]] (where he directs The Third Studio of Interior Design), head of Chair of Commercial Art, Computer Graphics and New Media in University of Information, Technology and Management in Rzeszów, [[Poland]], and a co-author of the nascent Center of Digital Arts and Techniques also in UITM, Rzeszów.

== Scientific career ==
He graduated from Faculty of Interior Design In Academy of Fine Art in Cracow. His [[doctoral thesis]] from 1985 showed groundbreaking approach to [[methodology]] of designing process &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Głowacki
  | first = Andrzej

  | isbn = 83-902122-0-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; treated as a creative act or even a [[peak experience]] rather than simple realization of an idea. Emotional aspect of creating and self-awareness of designer are equally important in this theory based on [[transpersonal psychology]] and [[existentialism]]. Though the theory was innovative it occurred to be too controversial for its times in Poland. It became a valuable source for curriculum, implemented and developed in The Third Studio of Interior Design since 1994.

He was Dean of Faculty of Interior Design from 1990 to 1993. As the first dean after 1989 he began process of reformation in Academy.

Currently he focuses on teaching and designing tangible and virtual realities, real spaces and cyberspaces.

== Design ==
He was one of the most popular Polish designers in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Mrozek|first = Józef |title = The Polish interior after the turning-point / L’architettura d’interni polacca dopo la svolta |url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/8594961/DOMUS-8049805|journal = Domus Architecture Design Art Communication / Architettura Design Arte Comunicazione |volume = 804|pages = 90–97|date=May 1998 | editor = Stefano Boeri |publisher = Editiorale Domus|location = Milano|issn = 0012-5377|language = Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He set up legendary, surrealistic Gallery Jo Design, which was located in Doubting Thomas's Corner in Cracow from 1992 to 1996. Popular polish and foreign artists: actors, writers, journalists were its frequent guests.
Projects from the 1990s represent optimistic design, full of stylistic courage and fun crafts with form. Objects are unconventional and quite unrealistic but they do not lose their functionality. Furniture, lamps and glass projects are the most characteristic. Their finessed shapes and both funny and philosophic names had many admirers in Europe.

== Inspirations ==
Theoretical physics is his great passion and influences his artistic activities. He often compares it with mystical knowledge of old cultures. According to the needs of the future he teaches transhumanistic ideas and designing for cyberspace.

== Exhibitions ==
Exhibitions of drawing, painting, graphics, collage in Poland, Germany, Netherlands and France, ex:
*Nijmeegs Museum – Commanderie van Sint Jan from 29/06 to 11/08 1985
*Museum Oud Rijnsburg - from 22/10/1989 to 16/3/1990 - Kunst uit Oost- Europa

A '''baby boom''' is a period marked by a significant increase of [[birth rate]]. This [[demography|demographic]] phenomenon is usually [[Ascribed characteristics|ascribed]] within certain [[geography|geographical]] bounds. People born during this period are often called [[baby boomer|baby boomers]]; however, some experts distinguish between those born during such demographic baby booms and those who identify with the overlapping [[generation|cultural generations]]. The causes of baby booms involves various [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factors]]. The [[Mid-twentieth century baby boom|most well-known baby boom]] occurred in middle of [[twentieth century]], beginning in late 1930s or early 1940s and ending in 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Bavel |first1=Jan |last2=Reher |first2=David S. |title=The Baby Boom and Its Causes: What We Know and What We Need to Know |journal=Population and Development Review |date=2013 |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=257–288 |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2013.00591.x |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2013.00591.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a change of trend that was largely unexpected, because in most countries it occurred in the midst of a period of improving economies and rising living standards.&lt;ref name="pmid25912917"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Reher DS |title = Baby booms, busts, and population ageing in the developed world |journal = Popul Stud (Camb) |volume = 69 Suppl 1 |issue = |pages = S57–68 |year = 2015 |pmid = 25912917 |doi = 10.1080/00324728.2014.963421 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GIBill.jpg|thumb|VA guaranteed interest rates]]
The baby boom occurred in countries that experienced tremendous damage from the war and were going through dramatic economic hardships. These countries include Germany and Poland. In the United States the baby boom was attributed to the number of veterans returning home after the war ended in 1945. It also was due to the strong post-war American economy. The U.S. Congress passed the G.I. Bill of Rights to encourage home ownership and higher levels of education by charging very low or no interest at all on loans for veterans. Getting settled in with a more comfortable economic position allowed families to have a place to live, be educated, and start having babies. "Now thriving on the American Dream, life was simple, jobs were plentiful, and a record number of babies were born."{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The U.S. birthrate exploded after World War II. From 1944 to 1961, more than 65 million children were born in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.countriesquest.com/north_america/usa/people/growth_of_u_s_population/growth_through_natural_increase_births/birthrates_since_world_war_ii/baby_boom.htm|title=Baby Boom – Birthrates Since World War II – Growth through Natural Increase: Births – Growth of U.S. Population – People – USA – North America: tubal ligation, adult baby, birth control, security system, million baby|website=www.countriesquest.com|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of this baby boom, a child was born every seven seconds. Factors that contributed to the baby boom consisted of young couples who started families after putting off marriage during the War, government encouragement of growth of families through the aid of GI benefits, and popular culture that celebrated pregnancy, parenthood, and large families.

The baby boom was the result of couples holding off on having children due to the Great Depression and World War II. Once the baby boom began, the average woman started getting married around the age of 20 instead of 22. Couples were eager to have babies after the war ended because they knew that the world would be a safer place to start a family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-us-history/period-8/apush-postwar-era/a/the-baby-boom|title=The baby boom|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another leading cause that led to the baby boom was that people were able to afford moving out to the suburbs to raise a family instead of living in the city. Additionally, the cost of living in the suburbs was very low, especially for those returning from the military. This was also the time period where women were encouraged to take on their "[[Nuclear family|roles]]", meaning that they were encouraged to stay home as a [[housewife]] along with being a mother while the husband worked.

The market became a seller's market. Many families were adapting to popular culture changes that included purchasing TVs, opening credit card accounts, and buying mouse ears to wear while watching ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. Overall, the baby boom time period was a blessing but it also had its flaws once economists realized how many children were being born. Concern arose about enough resources being available, especially when those born in the baby boom time period started having kids of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/baby-boomers|title=Baby Boomers - Facts &amp; Summary|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issues of the baby boom time period are that it could hugely impact the population change and cause social and economic impacts. One economic impact of the baby boom is the concern that when baby boomers get older and retire, the [[dependency ratio]] will increase. The Census Bureau estimates that the dependency ratio in the United States will be 65 by 2020 and reach a record-breaking high of 75, the highest it has been since the 1960s and 1970s when those baby boomers were children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-baby-boomers-retirement-means-for-the-u-s-economy/ |title=What Baby Boomers’ Retirement Means For the U.S. Economy |date=7 May 2014 |publisher=FiveThirtyEight |last=Casselman |first=Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economics of an area or country could benefit from the baby boom: It could increase the demand of housing, transportation, facilities and more for the increasing population. With an increase in population, the demand for food also increased. If a country cannot keep up with a rapidly increasing population, it could cause a food shortage and insufficient health care facilities. Without the sufficient supplies needed for the population, it could cause poor health that could lead to deaths in the population. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps125026/ERR79.pdf|title=Baby Boom Migration and Its Impact on Rural America|last=Cromartie|first=John|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
"According to the new UNICEF report, almost 2 billion babies will be born in Africa between 2015 and 2050 and the 2 main driving forces behind this surge in births and children are continued high fertility rates and rising numbers of women able to have children of their own."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/uploads/Africa_Baby_Boom.htm|title=Africa's Baby boom|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[HIV/AIDS]] crisis in [[Africa]] has contributed locally to a population boom.  Aid money used for [[contraceptives]] has been diverted over the past two decades into fighting HIV, which lead the number of babies born far outstripping the deaths from AIDS.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/world/africa/in-nigeria-a-preview-of-an-overcrowded-planet.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Elisabeth | last=Rosenthal | title=In Nigeria, a Preview of an Overcrowded Planet | date=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
After being in a lull of low birth rates, France experienced a baby boom after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Leslie |last=King |title=France needs children |journal=Sociological Quarterly |year=1998 |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=33–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sense that the population was too small, especially in regard to the more powerful Germany, was a common theme in the early 20th century. [[Pronatalist]] policies were proposed in the 1930s and implemented in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Marie-Monique |last=Huss |title=Pronatalism in the inter-war period in France |journal=Journal of Contemporary History |year=1990 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=39–68 |jstor=260720}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Colin L. |last=Dyer |title=Population and Society in 20th-Century France |year=1978 |isbn=9780841903081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there was steady immigration, especially from former French colonies in [[North Africa]]. [[Demographics of France|The population of France]] grew from 40.5 million in 1946 to nearly 50 million in 1968 and just under 60 million by 1999. The farm population declined sharply, from 35% of the workforce in 1945 to under 5% by 2000. By 2004, France had the second highest birthrate in Europe, behind only Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Colin |last=Jones |title=Paris: Biography of a City |year=2004 |page=438}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gilles |last=Pison |title=La population de la France en 2005 |journal=Population et Sociétés |date=March 2006 |issue=421 |url=http://perso.univ-rennes1.fr/jean-luc.richard/telechargement_fichier_fr_publi_pdf1_pop_et_soc_francais_421.pdf |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romania==
* [[Decreţei]]: (1967–1989), A baby boom in Romania was caused by a ban on abortion and contraception, consequently, hospitals became overcrowded. From the ''Chicago Tribune'' on December 26, 1967, the article stated that a doctor had to beg a woman to have a home birth due to overcrowding at the hospital, "Please stay at home, we have no rooms". The column also stated how "pregnant women were having to share hospitals beds and sickly babies were being put into oxygen tents in groups". The baby boom in Romania caused problems that began affecting the health of its residents. Abortion before being banned in 1966 was the only form of birth control, leaving people without access to that form of family planning. Another set of policies from Romania's Leader at the time, [[Nicolae Ceaușescu|Nicolae Ceausescu]], contributed to the baby boom based upon [[ethno-nationalism]]. To encourage people to have more children from dominant ethnic groups, the Romanian Government created financial incentives to have children, specifically a tax for anyone over 25 without a child. This motivated a lot of people to have children at a younger age, and with ethnic Romanian partners. Which lead to an initial surge of babies being born but then began to decrease in the birth rate to 14.3 births per individual by the 80's. In an effort to ramp up birth rates Ceausescu made new policies. Changing the legal age to marry to 15, social media campaigns and mandating monthly gynecological exams to all women of children bearing age. This caused a near 5x increase in spending for incentives, yet managed to decrease the birth rate by 40%. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Leslie|date=2002|title=Demographic trends, pronatalism, and nationalist ideologies in the late twentieth century,|doi=10.1080/01419870020036701d|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=25:3|pages=367-389|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The term "baby boom" most often refers to the [[post–World War II baby boom]](1946–1964) when the number of annual births exceeded 2 per 100 women (or approximately 1% of the total population size).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bouvier|first=L.

Recent baby boom periods include the following:
* Post–World War I baby boom: (1918–1929)
* [[Mid-twentieth century baby boom]], commonly called post-World War II baby boom: Years of duration vary, depending on the source.
* [[Millennials|Echo Boomers (Millennials)]]: (researchers and commentators use birth years ranging from the early 1980s to the mid 1990s) are the children of the baby boomers, [[generation x|Gen Xers]], and a few members of the [[Silent Generation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Leung, Rebecca |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/01/60minutes/main646890.shtml |title=The Echo Boomers |work=60 Minutes |publisher=CBS News |date=2005-09-04 |accessdate=2010-08-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100830095424/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/01/60minutes/main646890.shtml| archivedate= 30 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Vivian |last=Marino |title=College-Town Real Estate: The Next Big Niche? |date=August 20, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/realestate/commercial/20sqft.html?fta=y |work=The New York Times |pages=1 |accessdate= September 25, 2010 |quote=College enrollments have been on the rise as the baby boomers' children — sometimes known as the "echo boom" generation — come of age.

===Effects on dependency caused by the Baby boom (1946–1964)===
During the Baby boom the U.S. experienced after World War II, the dramatic rise in births led to a higher [[dependency ratio]], which means that there is a large portion of the population under the age of 15 and over the age of [[Retirement|65]] that relies on those in the work force (ages 15–64). The [[Demography|Cohort]] of this baby boom is expected to once again increase the dependency ratio once the majority is over the age of 65, as these people will no longer be part of the work force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Colby |first1=Sandra L. |last2=Ortman |first2=Jennifer M. |title=The baby boom cohort in the United States: 2012 to 2060: Population estimates and projections (2014) |pages=1–16 |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p25-1141.pdf |publisher=CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the 75 million baby boomers began to reach retirement age in 2011. Back in the year 2000 only 12.4% of our population was 65 or over and by 2020 its predicted to rise to 18%, largely due to the baby boom. Currently the Government supports social security to the population over 65, which may lead the states increasing their budget to fund programs like Medicaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Demographic, Employment, Expenditure, and Income‐Related Dependency Ratios: Population Aging in the Fifty States |last=Brucker |first=Eric |journal=Public Budgeting &amp; Finance |date=16 August 2006 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5850.2006.00855.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5197">'''Christian existential apologetics''' differs from traditional approaches to [[Christian apologetics]] by basing arguments for Christian [[theism]] on the satisfaction of existential needs rather than on strictly logical or evidential arguments. Christian existential apologetics may also be distinguished from [[Christian existentialism]] and from experiential apologetics. The former is a philosophic outlook concerned with the human condition in general; the latter consists of evidential argumentation based on religious experience.

==Existential apologetics==

Christian existential apologetics is “the demonstration that Christian faith is justified because it satisfies certain emotional and spiritual needs.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Williams (academic)|Clifford Williams]], ''Existential Reasons for Belief in God: A Defense of Desires and Emotions for Faith'' (Downers Grove, IL: IVP Academic, 2011) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; It typically consists of “existential arguments for believing in God” that are expressed as follows:

# Humans have certain “existential” needs. [[N. T. Wright]] lists four such needs: “the longing for justice, the quest for spirituality, the hunger for relationships, and the delight in beauty.” &lt;ref&gt;N. T. Wright, ''Simply Christian: Why Christianity Makes Sense'' (New York: HarperSanFrancisco, 2006), p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clifford Williams (academic)|Clifford Williams]] lists thirteen: “We need cosmic security. We need to know that we will live beyond the grave in a state that is free from the defects of this life, a state that is full of goodness and justice. We need a more expansive life, one in which we love and are loved. We need meaning, and we need to know that we are forgiven for going astray. We also need to experience awe, to delight in goodness and to be present with those we love.”&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Existential Reasons for Belief in God,'' p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Faith in God satisfies these needs.
# Therefore, faith in God is justified.

Williams states that this argument is not the same as an evidential argument: "A person who is convinced of an existential argument says, 'I believe because I am satisfied when I do.' A person who is convinced of an evidential argument says, 'I believe because there is a good reason to do so.'"&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Existential Reasons for Belief in God,'' p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; He also states that the argument is different from [[C. S. Lewis]]’s [[argument from desire]], which argues that there is an explanation of the source of the existential needs: “If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.”&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''Mere Christianity'' (New York: HarperSanFrancisco, 2001) pp. 136-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colin McGinn''' (born 10 March 1950) is a British philosopher. He has held teaching posts and professorships at [[University College London]], the [[University of Oxford]], [[Rutgers University]] and the [[University of Miami]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

McGinn is best known for his work in the [[philosophy of mind]], and in particular for what is known as [[new mysterianism]], the idea that the human mind is not equipped to solve the [[Mind-body problem|problem of consciousness]]. He is the author of over 20 books on this and other areas of philosophy, including ''The Character of Mind'' (1982), ''The Problem of Consciousness'' (1991), ''Consciousness and Its Objects'' (2004), and ''The Meaning of Disgust'' (2011).&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

In 2013 McGinn resigned from his tenured position at the University of Miami after being accused of [[sexual harassment]] by a female graduate student. The resignation touched off a debate about the prevalence of sexism and sexual harassment within academic philosophy.&lt;ref name="nyt-star"&gt;{{cite news | work = The New York Times | title = A Star Philosopher Falls, and a Debate Over Sexism Is Set Off | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/03/arts/colin-mcginn-philosopher-to-leave-his-post.html | first = Jennifer | last = Schuessler | date = August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
McGinn was born in [[West Hartlepool]], a town in County Durham, England. Several of his relatives, including both grandfathers, were miners. His father, Joseph, left school to become a miner but put himself through night school and became a building manager instead. McGinn was the eldest of three children, all sons. When he was three, the family moved to [[Gillingham, Kent|Gillingham]], Kent, and eight years later to [[Blackpool]], Lancashire. Having failed his [[Eleven plus exam|11-plus]], he attended a [[Secondary Technical School|technical school]] in Kent, then a [[Secondary modern school|secondary modern]] in Blackpool, but did well enough in his [[GCE Ordinary Level|O-levels]] to be transferred to the local [[grammar school]] for his [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin McGinn, ''The Making of a Philosopher'', New York: Harper Perennial, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, he began a degree in psychology at the [[University of Manchester]], obtaining a first-class honours degree in 1971 and an MA in 1972, also in psychology.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; He was admitted in 1972 to [[Jesus College, Oxford]], at first to study for a [[Bachelor of Letters]] postgraduate degree, but switched to the [[Bachelor of Philosophy]] (BPhil) postgraduate programme on the recommendation of his advisor, [[Michael R. Ayers]]. In 1973, he was awarded the university's prestigious John Locke Prize in Mental Philosophy; one of the examiners was [[A.J. Ayer]].&lt;ref&gt;McGinn 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;64, 85.&lt;p&gt;
For Ayer, see Colin McGinn, ''Minds and Bodies: Philosophers and Their Ideas'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pw28fydsWkwC&amp;pg=PA54 54]; for information about the prize, [http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2005-6/supps/schols/item_154.htm "John Locke Prize in Mental Philosophy"], ''Oxford University Gazette''; for a list of winners, [http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/prizes/full_list#John%20L "Winners of the John Locke Prize in Mental Philosophy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607080955/http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/prizes/full_list |date=7 June 2013 }}, ''Oxford University Gazette''.&lt;/ref&gt; He received his BPhil in 1974, writing a thesis under the supervision of [[Michael R. Ayers]] and [[P. F. Strawson]] on the semantics of [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]].&lt;ref&gt;McGinn 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;76–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching career==
===Posts===
McGinn taught at University College London for 11 years, first as a lecturer in philosophy (1974–1984), then as [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] (1984–1985). In 1985, he succeeded [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]] as [[Wilde Professor of Mental Philosophy|Wilde Reader in Mental Philosophy]] at the University of Oxford, a position he held until 1990. He held visiting professorships at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (1979), [[University of Bielefeld]] (1982), [[University of Southern California]] (1983), [[Rutgers University]] (1984), [[University of Helsinki]] (1986), [[City University of New York]] (1988) and [[Princeton University]] (1992). In 1990, he joined the philosophy department at Rutgers as a full professor, working alongside [[Jerry Fodor]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; He stayed at Rutgers until 2005, joining the [[University of Miami]] in 2006 as Professor of Philosophy and Cooper Fellow.&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222173231/http://www.as.miami.edu/phi/v1/mcginn/CV%20McGinn.pdf |date=22 December 2009 |title="''Curriculum vitae''" }} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20091222173231/http://www.as.miami.edu/phi/v1/mcginn/CV%20McGinn.pdf webcite]) and [https://web.archive.org/web/20120529063229/http://www.as.miami.edu/phi/people/faculty.html "Faculty"], Department of Philosophy, University of Miami, archived 29 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual-harassment complaint===

McGinn resigned his position at the University of Miami in January 2013, effective at the end of the calendar year, after a female graduate student complained that he had been sexually harassing her, including by text and email. He denied any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=Swanson28April2015&gt;Jess Swanson, [http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/is-it-ok-for-a-um-professor-to-burden-a-student-with-sexual-advances-7581424 "Is It OK for a UM Professor to Burden a Student With Sexual Advances?"], ''Miami New Times'', 28 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Represented by [[Ann Olivarius]], the student complained in April 2014 to the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] that the university had mishandled the case.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Wilson, [http://chronicle.com/article/Graduate-Student-Files/146231/ "Graduate Student Files Complaint Against U. of Miami in McGinn Scandal"], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', 28 April 2015.{{pb}}

The complaint accused McGinn of sexual harassment, civil assault and defamation, and Erwin of defamation. It alleged that the university had violated [[Title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972]] (which requires that women have equal access to education) by failing to investigate the student's complaint adequately and by failing to protect her from retaliation, including from McGinn on his blog before his resignation came into effect.&lt;ref name=Kingkade16Oct2015&gt;Tyler Kingkade, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/university-of-miami-lawsuit-mcginn_561fbe37e4b050c6c4a47ec1?21n61or "University Of Miami Sued Over Handling Of Colin McGinn Harassment Claims"], ''The Huffington Post'', 16 October 2015.{{pb}}

==Writing==
===Philosophy of mind===
McGinn has written extensively on [[philosophical logic]], [[metaphysics]], and the [[philosophy of language]] but is best known for his work in the [[philosophy of mind]]. He is known in particular for the development of the idea that human minds are incapable of solving the [[Mind-body problem|problem of consciousness]], a position known as [[new mysterianism]]. In addition to his academic publications on [[consciousness]]&amp;nbsp;–  including ''The Character of Mind'' (1982), ''The Problem of Consciousness'' (1991) and ''Consciousness and Its Objects'' (2004)&amp;nbsp;– he has written a popular introduction, ''The Mysterious Flame: Conscious Minds in a Material World'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;[[Galen Strawson]], [https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/07/11/reviews/990711.11strawst.html "Little Gray Cells"], ''The New York Times'', 11 July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Owen Flanagan]] introduced the term "new mysterians" in 1991 (named after [[Question Mark &amp; the Mysterians]], a 1960s band) to describe McGinn's position and that of [[Thomas Nagel]], first described in Nagel's "[[What is it like to be a bat?]]" (1974).&lt;ref name=Flanagan1991p313&gt;[[Owen Flanagan]], ''The Science of the Mind'', MIT Press, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=80HIwMz3bvwC&amp;pg=PA313 313].&lt;p&gt;
Thomas Nagel, "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?", ''The Philosophical Review'', 83 (4), October 1974, pp.&amp;nbsp;435–450. {{jstor|2183914}} Reprinted in Thomas Nagel, ''Mortal Questions'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979, pp.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fBGPBRX3JsQC&amp;pg=PA165 165–180].&lt;/ref&gt; McGinn introduced his position in "Can We Solve the Mind-Body Problem?" (''Mind'', 1989), and in ''The Problem of Consciousness'' (1991), arguing that the human mind is incapable of comprehending itself entirely.&lt;ref name=McGinn1989/&gt; [[Mark Rowlands]] writes that the 1989 article was largely responsible for reviving the debate about [[phenomenal consciousness]], or the nature of experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Rowlands]], "Mysterianism," in [[Max Velmans]], Susan Schneider (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2007 (pp.&amp;nbsp;335–345), p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B1lRZmOzuJ0C&amp;pg=PA337 337].&lt;/ref&gt; McGinn argued in the paper for the idea of [[Cognitive closure (philosophy)|cognitive closure]]:

&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 4px #ccc;padding:1.5em"&gt;
A type of mind M is cognitively closed with respect to a property P (or theory T), if and only if the concept-forming procedures at M's disposal cannot extend to a grasp of P (or an understanding of T). Conceiving minds come in different kinds, equipped with varying powers and limitations, biases and blindspots, so that properties (or theories) may be accessible to some minds but not to others. What is closed to the mind of a rat may be open to the mind of a monkey, and what is open to us may be closed to the monkey.&amp;nbsp;... But such closure does not reflect adversely on the reality of the properties that lie outside the representational capacities in question; a property is no less real for not being reachable from a certain kind of perceiving and conceiving mind.&lt;ref name=McGinn1989&gt;Colin McGinn, "Can We Solve the Mind-Body Problem?", ''Mind'', New Series, 98(391), July 1989 (pp.&amp;nbsp;349–366), p.&amp;nbsp;350. {{jstor|2254848}} Reprinted in Timothy O'Connor, David Robb (eds.), ''Philosophy of Mind: Contemporary Readings'', Routledge, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EfuBAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA438 438–457].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although human beings might grasp the concept of consciousness, McGinn argues that we cannot understand its causal basis: neither direct examination of consciousness nor of the brain can identify the properties that cause or provide the mechanism for consciousness, or how "technicolour phenomenology [can] arise from soggy grey matter."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2254848 McGinn 1989], p.&amp;nbsp;349.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, his answer to the [[hard problem of consciousness]] is that the answer is inaccessible to us.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B1lRZmOzuJ0C&amp;pg=PA335 335].&lt;/ref&gt;

New, or epistemological, mysterianism is contrasted with the old, or ontological, form, namely that consciousness is inherently mysterious or supernatural. The new mysterians are not Cartesian [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualists]].&lt;ref name=Flanagan1991p313/&gt; The argument holds that human minds cannot understand consciousness, not that there is anything supernatural about it.&lt;ref&gt;Uriah Kriegel, "Mysterianism," in Tim Bayne, Axel Cleeremans, Patrick Wilken (eds.), ''The Oxford Companion to Consciousness'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y_EBsfm2R5IC&amp;pg=PA461 461–462].&lt;/ref&gt; The mind-body problem is simply "the perimeter of our conceptual anatomy making itself felt."&lt;ref&gt;Colin McGinn, ''Minds and Bodies'', Oxford University Press, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pw28fydsWkwC&amp;pg=PA106 106].&lt;/ref&gt; McGinn describes this as existential [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin McGinn, ''The Problem of Consciousness'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;87–88.&lt;p&gt;

===Animal rights===
McGinn is a supporter of [[animal rights]], calling our treatment of non-humans "deeply and systematically immoral."&lt;ref&gt;Colin McGinn, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v13/n02/colin-mcginn/eating-animals-is-wrong "Eating animals is wrong"], ''London Review of Books'', 24 January 1991.&lt;p&gt;

Colin McGinn, ''Moral Literacy: Or How To Do The Right Thing'', London: Duckworth, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tot9PBjLNCQC&amp;pg=PA18 18ff].&lt;/ref&gt; His position is that we make the mistake of seeing the non-human only in relation to the human, because of "species solipsism": the farmer sees animals as food, the pet owner as companions for humans, the activist as victims of humans, the evolutionary biologist as "gene survival machines." But "their ''esse'' is not human ''percipi''" – "The rhino looks at us with the same skewed solipsism we bring to him," McGinn writes, "and surely we do not want to be as limited in our outlook as he is." He argues that "we need to improve our ''manners''" toward animals by recognizing that they have their own lives, and that those lives ought to be respected.&lt;ref&gt;Vicki Croke, et al., "A Consideration of Policy Implications: A Panel Discussion," ''Social Research'', 62(3), "In the Company of Animals" conference, Fall 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;801–838; McGinn on pp. 804–807. {{jstor|40971122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novels and articles===
Outside his work in philosophy, McGinn has regularly contributed reviews and short stories to the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' and ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Jeffries, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/21/highereducation.news "Enemies of thought"], ''The Guardian'', 31 December 2007; Patricia Cohen, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/12/books/12feud.html "The Nature of Reasons: Two Philosophers Feud Over a Book Review"], ''The New York Times'', 12 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/contributors/colin-mcginn Colin McGinn], ''London Review of Books''; [http://www.nybooks.com/contributors/colin-mcginn/ Colin McGinn], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and has written occasionally for ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''. He has also written two novels, ''The Space Trap'' (1992) and ''Bad Patches'' (2012).&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Radio and television==
In 1984, McGinn discussed [[John Searle]]'s Reith lectures on BBC Radio Three with Searle, [[Richard Gregory]] and [[Colin Blakemore]]. The following year, he and Sir [[Andrew Huxley]] debated animal rights with [[Bernard Williams]] as the moderator.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; He was interviewed for [[Jonathan Miller]]'s documentary mini-series, ''[[Atheism: A Rough History of Disbelief]]'' (2003), later broadcast as ''[[The Atheism Tapes]]'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/109-atheism-tapes-colin-mcginn "Atheism Tapes: Colin McGinn"], The Richard Dawkins Foundation, 12 May 2006 ({{YouTube|o68bcH_o1Yc}}).&lt;/ref&gt; He has also appeared in eleven episodes of ''[[Closer to Truth]]'' hosted by Robert Lawrence Kuhn, discussing consciousness, personal identity, free will, and materialism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.closertotruth.com/contributor/colin-mcginn/profile "Colin McGinn"], ClosertoTruth.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20110">In [[philosophy of mind|philosophy]], the '''computational theory of mind''' ('''CTM''') refers to a family of views that hold that the human [[mind]] is an [[information processing system]] and that cognition and consciousness together are a form of [[computation]]. Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) were the first to suggest that neural activity is computational. They argued that neural computations explain [[cognition]].&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;Piccinini, Gualtierro &amp; Bahar, Sonya, 2012. "Neural Computation and the Computational Theory of Cognition" in Cognitive Science. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/cogs.12012&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was proposed in its modern form by [[Hilary Putnam]] in 1967, and developed by his PhD student, philosopher and cognitive scientist [[Jerry Fodor]] in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary, 1961. "Brains and Behavior", originally read as part of the program of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Section L (History and Philosophy of Science), December 27, 1961, reprinted in Block (1983), and also along with other papers on the topic in Putnam, ''Mathematics, Matter and Method'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Computational Theory of Mind"&gt;[[Steven Horst|Horst, Steven]], (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/ "The Computational Theory of Mind"] in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being vigorously disputed in [[analytic philosophy]] in the 1990s due to work by Putnam himself, [[John Searle]], and others, the view is common in modern [[cognitive psychology]] and is presumed by many theorists of [[evolutionary psychology]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} In the 2000s and 2010s the view has resurfaced in analytic philosophy (Scheutz 2003, Edelman 2008).{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The computational theory of mind holds that the mind is a computational system that is realized (i.e. physically implemented) by neural activity in the brain. The theory can be elaborated in many ways and varies largely based on how the term computation is understood. Computation is commonly understood in terms of [[Turing machine]]s which manipulate symbols according to a rule, in combination with the internal state of the machine. The critical aspect of such a computational model is that we can abstract away from particular physical details of the machine that is implementing the computation.&lt;ref name="The Computational Theory of Mind"/&gt; This is to say that computation can be implemented by silicon chips or neural networks, so long as there is a series of outputs based on manipulations of inputs and internal states, performed according to a rule. CTM, therefore holds that the mind is not simply analogous to a computer program, but that it is literally a computational system.&lt;ref name="The Computational Theory of Mind"/&gt;

Computational theories of mind are often said to require [[Representation (psychology)|mental representation]] because 'input' into a computation comes in the form of symbols or representations of other objects. A computer cannot compute an actual object, but must interpret and represent the object in some form and then compute the representation. The computational theory of mind is related to the [[representational theory of mind]] in that they both require that mental states are representations. However, the representational theory of mind shifts the focus to the symbols being manipulated. This approach better accounts for systematicity and productivity.&lt;ref name="The Computational Theory of Mind"/&gt; In Fodor's original views, the computational theory of mind is also related to the [[language of thought]]. The language of thought theory allows the mind to process more complex representations with the help of semantics. (See below in semantics of mental states).

Recent work has suggested that we make a distinction between the mind and cognition. Building from the tradition of McCulloch and Pitts, the Computational Theory of Cognition (CTC) states that neural computations explain cognition.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt; The Computational Theory of Mind asserts that not only cognition, but also phenomenal consciousness or [[qualia]], are computational. That is to say, CTM entails CTC. While phenomenal consciousness could fulfill some other functional role, computational theory of cognition leaves open the possibility that some aspects of the mind could be non-computational. CTC therefore provides an important explanatory framework for understanding neural networks, while avoiding counter-arguments that center around phenomenal consciousness.

=="Computer metaphor"==
Computational theory of mind is not the same as the computer metaphor, comparing the mind to a modern-day digital computer.&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. [[The Blank Slate]]. New York: Penguin. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Computational theory just uses some of the same principles as those found in digital computing.&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt; While the computer metaphor draws an analogy between the mind as software and the brain as hardware, CTM is the claim that the mind is a computational system.

'Computational system' is not meant to mean a modern-day electronic computer. Rather, a computational system is a symbol manipulator that follows step by step functions to compute input and form output. [[Alan Turing]] describes this type of computer in his concept of a [[Turing Machine]].

==Early proponents==

One of the earliest proponents of the computational theory of mind was [[Thomas Hobbes]], who said, "by reasoning, I understand computation. And to compute is to collect the sum of many things added together at the same time, or to know the remainder when one thing has been taken from another. To reason therefore is the same as to add or to subtract."&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, Thomas "De Corpore"&lt;/ref&gt; Since Hobbes lived before the contemporary identification of computing with instantiating effective procedures, he cannot be interpreted as explicitly endorsing the computational theory of mind, in the contemporary sense.

==Causal picture of thoughts==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}At the heart of the Computational Theory of Mind is the idea that thoughts are a form of computation, and a computation is by definition a systematic set of laws for the relations among representations. This means that a mental state represents something if and only if there is some causal correlation between the mental state and that particular thing. An example would be seeing dark clouds and thinking “clouds mean rain”, where there is a correlation between the thought of the clouds and rain, as the clouds causing rain.  This is sometimes known as Natural Meaning. Conversely, there is another side to the causality of thoughts and that is the non-natural representation of thoughts. An example would be seeing a red traffic light and thinking “red means stop”, there is nothing about the color red that indicates it represents stopping, and thus is just a convention that has been invented, similar to languages and their abilities to form representations.

==Semantics of mental states==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
The computational theory of mind states that the mind functions as a symbolic operator, and that mental representations are symbolic representations; just as the [[semantics]] of language are the features of words and sentences that relate to their meaning, the semantics of mental states are those meanings of representations, the definitions of the ‘words’ of the [[language of thought]]. If these basic mental states can have a particular meaning just as words in a language do, then this means that more complex mental states (thoughts) can be created, even if they have never been encountered before. Just as new sentences that are read can be understood even if they have never been encountered before, as long as the basic components are understood, and it is syntactically correct. For example: “I have eaten plum pudding every day of this fortnight.” While it's doubtful many have seen this particular configuration of words, nonetheless most readers should be able to glean an understanding of this sentence because it is syntactically correct and the constituent parts are understood.

==Criticism==

A range of arguments have been proposed against physicalist conceptions used in Computational Theories of Mind.

An early, though indirect, criticism of the Computational Theory of Mind comes from philosopher [[John Searle]].  In his thought experiment known as the [[Chinese room]], Searle attempts to refute the claims that [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent systems]] can be said to have [[intentionality]] and [[understanding]] and that these systems, because they can be said to be minds themselves, are sufficient for the study of the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Minds, brains, and programs | year = 1980 | author = Searle, J.R. | journal = The Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 417–457}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Searle asks us to imagine that there is a man in a room with no way of communicating to anyone or anything outside of the room except for a piece of paper with symbols written on it that is passed under the door.  With the paper, the man is to use a series of provided rule books to return paper containing different symbols.  Unknown to the man in the room, these symbols are of a Chinese language, and this process generates a conversation that a Chinese speaker outside of the room can actually understand. Searle contends that the man in the room does not understand the Chinese conversation.  This is essentially what the computational theory of mind presents us—a model in which the mind simply decodes symbols and outputs more symbols.  Searle argues that this is not real understanding or intentionality.  This was originally written as a repudiation of the idea that computers work like minds.

Searle has further raised questions about what exactly constitutes a computation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the wall behind my back is right now implementing the [[WordStar]] program, because there is some pattern of molecule movements that is isomorphic with the formal structure of WordStar. But if the wall is implementing WordStar, if it is a big enough wall it is implementing any program, including any program implemented in the brain.&lt;ref name=Searle1992&gt;{{Citation
 | title =  The Rediscovery of the Mind
 | year = 1992
 | author = Searle, J.R.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Objections like Searle’s might be called insufficiency objections. They claim that computational theories of mind fail because computation is insufficient to account for some capacity of the mind. Arguments from qualia, such as Frank Jackson’s [[Knowledge argument]], can be understood as objections to computational theories of mind in this way—though they take aim at physicalist conceptions of the mind in general, and not computational theories specifically.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

There are also objections which are directly tailored for computational theories of mind.

Putnam himself (see in particular ''Representation and Reality'' and the first part of ''Renewing Philosophy'') became a prominent critic of computationalism for a variety of reasons, including ones related to Searle's Chinese room arguments, questions of world-word reference relations, and thoughts about the mind-body relationship. Regarding functionalism in particular, Putnam has claimed along lines similar to, but more general than Searle's arguments, that the question of whether the human mind ''can'' implement computational states is not relevant to the question of the nature of mind, because "every ordinary open system realizes every abstract finite automaton."&lt;ref name=Putnam1988&gt;{{Citation

[[Roger Penrose]] has proposed the idea that the human mind does not use a knowably sound calculation procedure to understand and discover mathematical intricacies. This would mean that a normal [[Turing complete]] computer would not be able to ascertain certain mathematical truths that human minds can.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Penrose, "Mathematical Intelligence," in Jean Khalfa, editor, ''What is Intelligence?'', chapter 5, pages 107-136. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prominent scholars==
* [[Daniel Dennett]] proposed the [[Multiple Drafts Model]], in which consciousness seems linear but is actually blurry and gappy, distributed over space and time in the brain. Consciousness is the computation, there is no extra step or "[[Cartesian Theater]]" in which you become conscious of the computation.
* [[Jerry Fodor]] argues that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Further, this language of thought itself is codified in the brain, not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought. In later work (''Concepts'' and ''The Elm and the Expert''), Fodor has refined and even questioned some of his original computationalist views, and adopted a highly modified version of LOT (see ''LOT2'').
* [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]] proposed that cognitive processes have three levels of description: the computational level (which describes that computational problem (i.e., input/output mapping) computed by the cognitive process); the algorithmic level (which presents the algorithm used for computing the problem postulated at the computational level); and the implementational level (which describes the physical implementation of the algorithm postulated at the algorithmic level in biological matter, e.g. the brain). (Marr 1981)
* [[Ulric Neisser]] coined the term 'cognitive psychology' in his book published in 1967 (''Cognitive Psychology''), wherein Neisser characterizes people as dynamic information-processing systems whose mental operations might be described in computational terms.
* [[Steven Pinker]] described a "language instinct," an evolved, built-in capacity to learn language (if not writing).
* [[Hilary Putnam]] proposed [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] to describe consciousness, asserting that it is the computation that equates to consciousness, regardless of whether the computation is operating in a brain, in a computer, or in a "brain in a vat."
* [[Georges Rey]], professor at the [[University of Maryland]], builds on Jerry Fodor's representational theory of mind to produce his own version of a Computational/Representational Theory of Thought.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1638">'''Constitutivism''' is the position in [[meta-ethics]] which links what we ought to do morally with the rules about our make up as agents who perform actions of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrero, Luca (2009). Constitutivism and the Inescapability of Agency. Oxford Studies in Metaethics 4:303-333.&lt;/ref&gt; It claims to answer doubts about the validity of moral judgements, and about moral objectivity, by explaining that we cannot help but act, therefore we act in accordance with moral rules which are essential to any acting being.

Although a recent development in [[moral philosophy]], it has its roots in the work of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] in moral philosophy.

==Some authors in Constitutivism==
[[Christine Korsgaard]]&lt;ref&gt;Korsgaard, C.M., 2008, The Constitution of Agency, Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Velleman]]&lt;ref&gt;Velleman, D., 2009, How We Get Along, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; are prominent writers on constitutivism, although defending different versions.

==Criticism==
Constitutivism has been criticised for various reasons, chiefly for circularity. It is claimed that it presupposes the truth of what it seeks to justify, i.e. moral judgements and truths.&lt;ref&gt;Enoch, D., 2006, “Agency, Shmagency: Why Normativity Won't Come from What is Constitutive of Agency,” Philosophical Review, 115: 169–198. {{JSTOR|20446897}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein, M., 2012 Inescapability And Normativity  Journal of Ethics &amp; Social Philosophy VOL. 6, No. 3 | December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jigten Sumgon.jpg|thumb|Jigten Sumgon, founder of Drikung Kagyu]]
'''Drikung Kagyu''' or '''Drigung Kagyu''' ([[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;bri-gung bka'-brgyud) is one of the eight "minor" lineages of the [[Kagyu]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. "Major" here refers to those Kagyu lineages founded by the immediate disciples of [[Gampopa]] (1079-1153) while "minor" refers to all the lineages founded by disciples of [[Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo|Phagmo Drupa]] (1110-1170), the main disciple of Gampopa.

== History ==
[[File:Drikung Kagyu Lineage Tree.jpg|thumb|Drikung Kagyu Lineage Tree]]
Like with all other [[Kagyu]] lineages, origins of Drikung Kagyu can be traced back to the Great Indian Master [[Tilopa]] who passed on his teachings to Mahasiddha [[Naropa]] who lived around 10th and 11th century. The founder of  the Drikung Kagyu lineage was [[Jigten Sumgön]] (1143-1217) of the Kyura clan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drikung.org/drikung-kagyu-lineage|title=Drikung Kagyu Lineage|website=www.drikung.org|access-date=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was the disciple of [[Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo|Phagmo Drupa]]. According to historical account from the time, [[Jigten Sumgön|Jigten Sumgön's]] teachings attracted more than 100,000 people at a time, with the highest number of attendance recorded at 130,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Opening the Treasure of the Profound: Teachings on the Songs of Jigten Sumgon and Milarepa|last=Gyaltsen|first=Konchok|publisher=Snow Lion|year=2013|isbn=978-1611800708|location=|pages=ch. 10|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several sub-schools branched off from the Drikung Kagyu including the Lhapa or Lhanangpa Kagyu, founded by Nö Lhanangpa ({{bo|w=gnyos lha nang pa}}, 1164–1224) who came to Bhutan in 1194. This school was at one time important in Western Bhutan, particularly in the [[Thimphu District|Thimphu]] and [[Paro District|Paro]] regions, where they were rivals of the Drukpa Kagyu. The Lhapa first came into conflict with the early Drukpa teacher, [[Phajo Drugom Zhigpo]] (b. 12th century)&lt;ref&gt;''see:'' Dargye and Sørensen (2001) pp.ix–x, 34–36, 41–46&lt;/ref&gt; and finally with [[Ngawang Namgyal]] (1594–1651). In 1640 the remaining followers of the Lhapa Kagyu were expelled from Bhutan together with the Nenyingpa followers as both had sided with the attacking [[Tsangpa]] forces against the Drukpa during their three invasions of Bhutan and continued to refuse to acknowledge the authority of the Shabdrung.&lt;ref&gt;Dorje, Sangay and Kinga (2008) pp.146–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monasteries==
The first and main Drikung Kagyu monastery is [[Drigung Monastery|Drikung Thil Monastery]],&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.drikung.org/drikung-kagyu-lineage A Brief History of the Drikung Kagyu Lineage of Tibetan Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1179&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; by [[Jigten Sumgön]]&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; approximately 150 kilometers northeast of [[Lhasa]].

Aside from the Drikung Valley in [[Ü-Tsang|Ü]], the Drikung Kagyu has a strong presence in [[Nangqên County]] in what was [[Kham]], in western Tibet (including Kailash), and in [[Ladakh]]. Tsari and Lapchi - two important sacred sites for all Tibetan Buddhists - also have a strong Drikung Kagyu presence. Among the so-called "four major and eight minor" Kagyu lineages, Drikung Kagyu is one of four Kagyu lineages that continue to exist as independent institutions (the other three being the [[Karma Kagyu]], [[Drukpa Lineage]] and [[Taklung Kagyu]]).

Drikung Kagyu is one of the most prominent lineages in [[Ladakh]] where its main monasteries are [[Phyang Monastery|Phyang]] and [[Lamayuru Monastery|Lamayuru]], with roughly 50 other monasteries spread across Ladakh region.

{{Tibetan Buddhism sidebar}}

==Lhanangpa sect==
A sub-school of the Drikung was the Lhapa or [[Lhanang Kagyu]], which was influential in western Bhutan from the arrival of Gyalwa Lhanangpa (b.1164) in 1194 down to the time of [[Ngawang Namgyal]]. Members of the Lhapa tradition built some of the [[dzong architecture|earliest dzongs in Bhutan]].

In 1640 or 1641 members of the Lhapa sect were expelled from Bhutan together with the [[Nenying Kagyu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Dorji|first = Sangay (Dasho) | authorlink = |others=Kinga, Sonam (trans)| title =  The Biography of Zhabdrung Nga wang Namgyal: Pal Drukpa Rinpoche   | publisher = KMT Publications  | year = 2008| location = Thimphu, Bhutan   | pages =146–7 | isbn = 99936-22-40-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they had sided with the [[Tibet|Central Tibetan]] forces against the Drukpas during Tibet's three invasions of Bhutan.

==Spiritual heads==
From the founding of Drikung Thil Monastery in 1179 to the present day, the Drikung Kagyu lineage has been led by a succession of spiritual heads ("throne-holders"). One of the two current heads of the lineage, Drikung Kyabgön Chetsang Rinpoche,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/prlink/His-Holiness-Drikung-Kyabgon-Chetsang-Rinpoche-Head-of-the-Drikung-Kagyu-Lineage-of-Tibetan-Buddhism-will-visit-St-Petersburg-Se His Holiness Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche, Head of the Drikung Kagyu Lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, will visit St. Petersburg September 14-15, 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013102528/http://www.tampabay.com/prlink/His-Holiness-Drikung-Kyabgon-Chetsang-Rinpoche-Head-of-the-Drikung-Kagyu-Lineage-of-Tibetan-Buddhism-will-visit-St-Petersburg-Se |date=October 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chetsang"&gt;[http://www.drikung.org/their-holiness/hh-kyabgoen-chetsang His Holiness Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang]&lt;/ref&gt; Könchok Tenzin Kunzang Thinley Lhundrup (b. 1946),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gruber|first=Elmar R. | title=From the Heart of Tibet: The Biography of Drikung Chetsang Rinpoche, the Holder of the Drikung Kagyu Lineage | year=2010 | publisher=Shambhala | location=Boston | isbn=978-1-59030-765-6}} [http://ergruber.com/index.php/en/buecher/32-buecher/sprachen/deutsch/89-aus-dem-herzen-tibets Synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt; the 37th Drikungpa resides at Drikung Kagyu Institute at Dehra Dun, India.&lt;ref name="chetsang"/&gt; The other head of the Drikung Kagyu Lineage, the 36th Drikungpa, Drikung Kyabgön Chungtsang Rinpoche, Könchok Tenzin Chökyi Nangwa (b. 1942) lives in Lhasa, Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drikung.org/their-holiness/hh-kyabgoen-chungtsang His Holiness Drikung Kyabgon Chungtsang]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctrines===
The unique doctrines of Drikung Kagyu as taught by its founder, Jigten Sumgön is preserved in "The Single Intention" (Wylie: dgongs gcig)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dgongs1.com/ For the Gongchig see the blog by Jan-Ulrich Sobisch (Copenhagen University) dgongs1.com.]&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Essence of Mahāyāna Teachings" (Wylie: theg chen bstan pa'i snying po). The main practices of Drikung Kagyu are “The Five-fold Profound Path of Mahamudrā,” and “The Six Dharmas of Nāropa.”

==Lineage notes==

===Phowa===
The Drikung lineage is popularly known for its development of the practice of [[Phowa]], in which a practitioner learns how to expel his/her consciousness or [[mindstream]] through the [[posterior fontanelle]] at the top of the [[Human skull|skull]] at the moment of death. One of the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]], this practice is said to aid the practitioner in remaining aware through the death experience, thus aiding one in attaining enlightenment in the [[Bardo]] (the state in between death and the next rebirth) or in achieving a birth conducive to the practice of [[Dharma]].

===Female protector===
Another unique feature of the Drikung lineage is its female [[dharmapāla]], [[Achi Chokyi Drolma]]. The great-grandmother of Jigten Sumgön,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khandro.net/deity_achi_chokyi_dolma.htm Achi Chokyi Drolma] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101153731/http://www.khandro.net/deity_achi_chokyi_dolma.htm |date=November 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; she prophesied his birth and vowed to protect those in his lineage. She is unusual in that she is both a female protector and an enlightened [[bodhisattva]] that can be taken as an [[Iṣṭadevatā (Buddhism)|iṣṭadevatā]] in meditation practice. She is depicted either sitting on a horse or standing with a [[kapala]] in her left hand and a [[mirror]] in her right hand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himalayanart.org/image.cfm/73896.html Worldly Protector (Buddhist) - Achi Chokyi Drolma]&lt;/ref&gt; Achi's practice became so popular that she has been included in other lineages, such as the [[Karma Kagyu]].

===First Buddhist nun===
In 2002 Khenmo Drolma, an American woman, became the first [[bhikkhuni]] (a fully ordained Buddhist nun) in the Drikung Kagyu lineage. She is also the first westerner, male or female, to be installed as an abbot in the Drikung Kagyu lineage, having been installed as the abbot of the Vajra Dakini Nunnery (America's first  Tibetan Buddhist nunnery, located in Vermont) in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vajradakininunnery.org/firstsforwomen.html Women Making History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601092702/http://www.vajradakininunnery.org/firstsforwomen.html |date=2010-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15326">'''Economic opportunism''' is a term related to the subversion of [[morality]] to [[profit (economics)|profit]]. There exists no agreed general, scientific definition or theory of economic opportunism; the literature usually considers only specific cases and contexts. 

==Description==
There is no agreement about ''why'' this is so. [[Oliver E. Williamson]] comments:

{{Quotation|"Although there is growing agreement that [[bounded rationality]] is the appropriate cognitive assumption for describing economic organization, there is less agreement on how the self-interestedness of economic actors should be described. [[Transaction cost economics]] has proposed that economic agents be described as opportunistic where this contemplates self-interest seeking with guile. That has turned out to be a controversial formulation."&lt;ref&gt;Oliver E. Williamson, "Opportunism and its critics", in: ''Managerial and decision economics'', Vol. 14, 1993, p. 97). A criticism of Williamson is provided in Geoffrey M. Hodgson, "Opportunism is not the only reason why firms exist: why an explanatory emphasis on opportunism may mislead management strategy." In: ''Industrial and Corporate Change'', Volume 13, Number 2, pp. 401–418.[https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/2299/408/1/102898.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Market trade supplies no universal [[morality]] of its own, except the law of [[contract]] and basic practical requirements to settle transactions, while at the same time legal rules, however precise in their formulation, cannot control ''every last detail'' of transactions and the interpretation (or implications) thereof. Since economic opportunism must be assessed against some relevant norm or principle, controversy about what that norm or principle should be, makes a general definition difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Chao C. Chen, Mike W. Peng, Patrick A. Saparito, "Individualism, Collectivism, and Opportunism: A Cultural Perspective on Transaction Cost Economics". In: ''Journal of Management'', Vol. 28 No. 4, 2002,  pp. 567–583.{{cite web |url=http://www.utdallas.edu/~mikepeng/pdf/Peng02JM.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903233632/http://www.utdallas.edu/~mikepeng/pdf/Peng02JM.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Economists frequently cannot even agree on the basic principles of the functioning of economic life, and consequently what constitutes a deviation from those principles is in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Lex Donaldson, ''American anti-management theories of organization: a critique of paradigm proliferation.'' Cambridge University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Market trade is compatible with a great variety of moral norms, religions and political systems, and indeed supporters of the [[free market]] claim that this is exactly its advantage: people can ''choose their own values'', buying and selling as they wish within a basic legal framework accepted by all.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas C. Leonard, "The price is wrong: causes and consequences of ethical restraint in trade." ''Journal des Economistes et des Etudes Humaines'', Volume 14, numéro 4, Décembre 2004, pp 1–17.[http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/iswrong.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Economic action therefore involves a great variety of motives, some more honorable than others.
*It is not feasible to outlaw many forms of economic opportunism, because any such law could not be effectively enforced, or, such laws would conflict with the [[civil rights]] or trading rights of citizens. People often complain about "over-regulation" or "too many rules" – too much "policing" may mean that they no longer take economic initiatives (or become confused about what rule to follow).&lt;ref&gt;"...mainstream economics has become obsessed with the ‘irresponsibility’ of opportunistic politicians who cater to an economically uneducated electorate by interfering with otherwise efficient markets, in pursuit of objectives — such as full employment and social justice — that truly free markets would in the long run deliver anyway, but must fail to deliver when distorted by politics". – Wolfgang Streeck, "The crises of democratic capitalism". ''New Left Review'' 71, September–October 2011.[http://www.newleftreview.org/II/71/wolfgang-streeck-the-crises-of-democratic-capitalism]&lt;/ref&gt;
*It is often disputed in economics whether the opportunist, as a type of "entrepreneur", creates more opportunities for everybody by what he does, or whether the opportunist is a "pest" with a harmful effect on economic life. Evaluating this objectively can be extraordinarily difficult, because people may not even agree about what the true costs and benefits are.

[[Adam Smith]] famously wrote in ''The Wealth of Nations'' that:

{{quotation|"By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, [every individual] intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an '''invisible hand''' to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was not part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Smith]], ''The Wealth of Nations'', Book IV, chapter 2, paragraph ix.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

If that Smithian view is accepted, then it is difficult to establish that "taking selfish advantage of an economic situation" can in any way be considered "opportunist", because it does not transgress any moral principle or principle of trade. Indeed, the pursuit of self-interest is in this view ''beneficial'' for all, it is exactly what makes the market tick. Furthermore, it is in the interest of market actors to conduct their affairs properly, because if their trading reputation is destroyed, they will be out of business. If it is believed that markets gravitate spontaneously to an [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] state, so that price-levels ensure that everybody gets what they want, how can there be any "opportunism"?&lt;ref&gt;See: Charles W. L. Hill, "Cooperation, Opportunism and the Invisible Hand: Implications for transaction cost theory", in: ''Academy of Management Review'', Vol. 15 No. 3, 1990, p. 500-513).&lt;/ref&gt;

At best one could draw a subtle distinction between "selfishness" and "self-interest". For example, "self-interest" could be defined as a healthy concern with one's own wellbeing, necessary to survive and prosper, while "selfishness" could be defined as an exclusive or excessive concern with one's own advantage while disregarding the interests of others. Any trading relationship usually involves both cooperation between the trading partners, so that each gets what they want from others, and competition by each party to get the best deal for themselves. So the trading relationship is normally both self-directed and other-directed at the same time. The issue then is, just how far the concerns of other party or parties to the trade are really taken into account, or to what extent the expectations of others are fully met or honoured.

"Selfishness" would then denote a ''specific type'' of self-interest which violates a ''shared'' principle of trade (or some other principle) in a way that is illegitimate, unfair, unjust in some sense (such as unfair trade, [[negligence]] or [[unfair competition]]). Adam Smith does not rule out that possibility, acknowledging implicitly that the self-interest and the interest of society may not ''always'' be compatible, only "frequently". Opportunism could then be thought of as an ''aberration'', a "[[market failure|market imperfection]]" or a "grey area" that sometimes occurs in normal trading activity.

People would not normally trade, if they did not expect to gain something by it; the fact that they do trade, rather than simply rob each other, normally presupposes at least a respect for the basic rights of the party being traded with. Nevertheless, the gains or benefits of trading activity (and indeed the losses), although entirely legal, might be distributed very ''unequally'' or in ways not anticipated by previous understandings, and thus accusations of "economic opportunism" can arise nevertheless in many different settings.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Eggert, "Limiting abuse and opportunism by mortgage servicers". In: ''Housing Policy Debate'' (Fannie Mae Foundation), Vol. 15, Issue 3, 2004.[http://msfraud.org/Articles/abuseopportunism.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The entitlement to make some economic gains is then considered to be illegitimate, in some way.

If this is the case, relevant trading obligations (or civil obligations) are usually considered as not being (fully) met or honored, in the pursuit of economic self-interest. [[Greed]] is frequently mentioned as a primary motive for economic opportunism.&lt;ref&gt;Damian Saunders, "Mark Hurd and HP, economic opportunism and greed, one year on." ''Opinion'', 30 January 2010.[http://www.damiansaunders.net/comment/hps-economic-opportunism-and-greed-one-year-on] Dan Ackman, "Kozlowski Speaks!". ''Forbes Magazine'', 28 April 2005.[https://www.forbes.com/2005/04/28/cx_da_0428topnews.html] Ken Frost, "The Ongoing Trials of The Late Michael Jackson: Greed and Opportunism." 2 February 2005.[http://michaeljacksonstrial.blogspot.com/2005/02/greed-and-opportunism.html]&lt;/ref&gt;   Even so, people might just try to get the most out of a situation for themselves with the least effort they can get away with, disregarding the interests of others who also have a stake in the situation (see [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]). An editor of the [[Financial Times]], [[Martin Wolf]], remarked famously about the financial sector that "No [other] industry has a comparable talent for privatising gains and socialising losses."&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Wolf]], "Regulators should intervene in bankers’ pay". In: ''[[Financial Times]]'' (London), 16 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some years later, he explained that "Today’s banks represent the incarnation of profit-seeking behaviour taken to its logical limits, in which the only question asked by senior staff is not what is their duty or their responsibility, but what can they get away with."&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Wolf]], "Banking reforms after the Libor scandal." ''Financial Times'', 2 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

What exactly the rightful or correct obligations of trading parties are to each other, can be open to interpretation "in good faith" ([[bona fide]]) by those trading parties or other parties. It may depend on the "understanding" that exists in a business situation.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchel Abolafia, ''Making markets: opportunism and restraint on Wall Street''. Harvard University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This creates the possibility that, even although – strictly speaking, or formally – everything is done "within the law", economic actors nevertheless do not (or not fully) honour their trading obligations in some way, for selfish motives, and therefore commit what amounts to deceit, trickery or cheating, by utilizing a somewhat different "interpretation", "intention", "expectation" or "understanding". Therefore, there is always much controversy about ''what these obligations really are'', in the fine detail – it may be that "one man's opportunism is another man's opportunity".

At issue here is, what one might legitimately expect a trading party to understand or comply with in a business deal, i.e. how the ''meaning'' of it is construed, which can differ between trading parties with a different stake or interest in the deal, and might itself change in the course of negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Ravi S. Achrol and Gregory T. Gundlach, "Legal and social safeguards against opportunism in exchange." ''Journal of Retailing'', Volume 75, Issue 1, Spring 1999, Pages 107–124.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether a trading activity is viewed as "opportunist" might just depend on one's moral viewpoint or informal expectation, because "there is no law against it". For this reason, [[institutional economics]] often evaluates economic opportunism in relation to those norms of acceptable human conduct that, though not necessarily stated in laws, are nevertheless ''implied'' by legislation or by [[jurisprudence]].

Glenn R. Parker&lt;ref&gt;In his book ''Self-policing in politics: the political economy of reputational controls on politicians'' (Princeton University Press, 2004, p.21).&lt;/ref&gt; claims that the five most discussed examples of ''economic'' opportunism are:

*[[adverse selection]]
*[[moral hazard]]
*last-period exploitation, when it is known that competitors or stakeholders are not able to respond to a suitably timed selfish action.
*reneging (in contracts), where a contractual agreement, promise, intention or understanding of a deal is not fully honoured by a party to the contract, for selfish motives, because it is possible "to get away with it" and/or because there is an incentive to do so.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. G. Richard Shell, "Opportunism and trust in the Negotiation of Commercial Contracts: Toward a New Cause of Action." ''Vanderbilt Law Review'', Vol. 44, March 1991, pp. 221–282.&lt;/ref&gt;
*shirking, involving some kind of negligence, or failure to acquit oneself of a duty (or a responsibility) previous agreed or implied (see also [[efficiency wages]]).

In [[transaction cost economics]], opportunism means self-interest seeking with guile, involving some kind of deliberate [[deceit]] and the absence of moral restraint. It could involve deliberately withholding or distorting important business information, shirking (doing less work than agreed), or failing to fulfill formal or informal promises and obligations. It occurs in trading activities especially where rules and sanctions are lacking, and where the opportunist actor has great power to influence an outcome by the attitude he assumes in practice.

However, others&lt;ref&gt;Nicolai J. Foss and Peter G. Klein, "Critiques of transaction cost economics: An overview". ''Organizations and markets'', September 2009 [http://organizationsandmarkets.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/foss-and-klein-critiques-of-transaction-cost-economics-an-overview.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; argue that this reflects a narrow view of economic opportunism, because there are many more ways that economic actors can take selfish advantage of other economic actors, even if they do not violate the law.&lt;ref&gt;See further Kuntara Pukthuanthong and Harry J. Turtle, "Legal Opportunism, Litigation Risk, and IPO Underpricing", January 2009  [http://69.175.2.130/~finman/Reno/Papers/LegalOpportunismLitigationRiskAndIPOUnderpricingnFMA0109n.pdf]; Paul J. Zak (ed.), ''Moral markets: the critical role of values in the economy''. Princeton University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, managers can tilt the details of financial reporting in such a way that it favours their own position.&lt;ref&gt;Lan Sun and Subhrendu Rath, "Fundamental Determinants, Opportunistic Behavior and Signaling Mechanism: An Integration of Earnings Management Perspectives." ''International Review of Business Research Papers'' Vol. 4, No. 4, Aug–Sept. 2008, Pp. 406–420.[http://www.bizresearchpapers.com/32-Lansun.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis Bowen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|ən}}; September 8, 1811 – January 22, 1890) was an [[American philosopher]], writer, and educationalist.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]].  He was educated at Mayhew School, Boston, [[Phillips Exeter Academy]],&lt;ref name="DAB"&gt;{{Cite DAB|title=Bowen, Francis|author=Ernest Sutherland Bates|year=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Harvard University]], graduating from the latter in 1833. While attending Harvard, he taught school at [[Hampton Falls, New Hampshire]], and [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] and [[Northborough, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="ANB"&gt;{{Cite ANB|title=Bowen, Francis|author=R. Douglas Geivett}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from Harvard, he taught for two years at [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], returning to Harvard from 1835 to 1839 to tutor in Greek&lt;ref name="ANB"/&gt; and teach intellectual philosophy and political economy. In 1839 he went to Europe, and, while living in Paris, met [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi|Sismondi]], [[Joseph Marie, baron de Gérando|de Gerando]], and other scholars. He returned to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] in 1841 and devoted himself to literature. He was editor and proprietor of the ''[[North American Review]]'' from 1843 to 1854, writing, during this time, about one fourth of the articles in it. In 1848 and 1849, he delivered lectures before the [[Lowell Institute]] on the application of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[Ethics|ethical]] science to the evidences of religion.

In 1850 he was appointed McLean professor of history at Harvard, but his appointment was disapproved by the board of overseers on account of political opinions he had expressed concerning the [[Hungarian revolution of 1848]]. Bowen had written two articles on Hungary for his ''North American Review''&amp;nbsp;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Kuklick|title=The Rise of American Philosophy: Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1860-1930|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Connecticut|year=1977|page=605 (note 1 for chapter 2)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmdJ9ty_NsQC&amp;pg=PA605 | isbn=978-0-300-02413-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''The War of Races in Hungary''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[North American Review]]|title=The War of Races in Hungary|pages=78–136|volume=70|issue=146|date=January 1850|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=nora;cc=nora;rgn=full%20text;idno=nora0070-1;didno=nora0070-1;view=image;seq=0084;node=nora0070-1%3A4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (January 1850) and ''The Rebellion of the Slavonic, Wallachian, and German Hungarians against the Magyars''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[North American Review]]|title=The Rebellion of the Slavonic, Wallachian, and German Hungarians against the Magyars|pages=205–249|volume=72|issue=150|date=January 1851|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=nora;cc=nora;rgn=full%20text;idno=nora0072-1;didno=nora0072-1;view=image;seq=0211;node=nora0072-1%3A8}}&lt;/ref&gt; (January 1851). 
[[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] wrote a series of articles for the Boston ''Atlas'' in reply. These articles, republished in a pamphlet as ''The Hungarian Controversy'' (Boston, 1852), are said to have been the cause of the rejection by the overseers of Bowen's appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Carter, Robert|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the winter of 1850, Bowen lectured again before the Lowell Institute on political economy, and in 1852 on the origin and development of the English and American constitutions. In 1853, on the election of [[James Walker (Harvard)|James Walker]] to the presidency of Harvard, Bowen was appointed his successor as Alford professor of natural religion, moral philosophy and civil polity. This time the appointment was approved almost unanimously by the overseers, and he occupied the chair until 1889. After 1858, he lectured before the Lowell Institute on the English metaphysicians and philosophers from [[Francis Bacon]] to [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]].

In 1876 he was a member of the United States Silver Commission which was appointed to consider currency reform. In 1877, he wrote the minority report in which he opposed the restoration of the [[Bimetallism|double standard]] and the remonetization of silver. In 1888, he was asked to endorse the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s tariff platform, but replied by publishing an article (''Nation'', November 8, 1888) denouncing the current tariff as tyranny.&lt;ref name="DAB"/&gt;

In philosophy and metaphysics, Bowen upheld the views of [[George Berkeley]] and [[John Locke]] and opposed those of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Victor Cousin]], [[Auguste Comte]], and [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref name="nie"&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Bowen, Francis|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter replied to his criticism in the 3rd edition of his ''Logic''. In [[political economy]], Bowen opposed the doctrines of [[Adam Smith]] on free trade, [[Thomas Malthus]] on population, and [[David Ricardo]] on rent. He took pains to trace the influence of our form of government and condition of society upon economical questions. A significant philosophical interest was harmonizing philosophy with Christianity.&lt;ref name="DAB"/&gt; Piety marked his writing and teaching.&lt;ref name="ANB"/&gt;

He died in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].

'''Functional illiteracy''' is [[reading (activity)|reading]] and [[writing]] skills that are inadequate "to manage daily living and employment tasks that require reading skills beyond a basic level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schlechty |first=Phillip C. |url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/wiley031/00009570.pdf |format=Pdf |title=Shaking Up the Schoolhouse: How to Support and Sustain Educational Innovation |publisher=Catdir.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functional illiteracy is contrasted with [[illiterate|illiteracy]] in the strict sense, meaning the inability to read or write simple sentences in any language.

Foreigners who cannot read and write in the native language where they live may also be considered functionally illiterate.

==Definition==
Illiteracy as well as functional illiteracy were defined on the 20th session of UNESCO in 1978 as follows:

{{quotation | A person is illiterate who cannot with understanding both read and write a short simple statement on his everyday life.

A person is functionally illiterate who cannot engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective functioning of his group and community and also for enabling him to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his own and the community’s development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001140/114032E.pdf|title=Records of the 20th General Conference of UNESCO: Resolutions|year=1978|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The characteristics of functional illiteracy vary from one culture to another, as some cultures require better reading and writing skills than others.  A reading level that might be sufficient to make a farmer functionally literate in a rural area of a developing country might qualify as functional illiteracy in an urban area of a technologically advanced country. In languages with [[phonemic orthography|regular spelling]], functional illiteracy is usually defined simply as reading too slow for practical use, inability to effectively use dictionaries and written manuals, etc.

==Links with poverty and crime==
In developed countries, the level of functional literacy of an individual is proportional to income level and inversely proportional to the risk of committing crime. For example, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics in the United States:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2006/2006483.pdf|title=The Health Literacy of America’s Adults|publisher=[[United States Department of Education]]|format=PDF|year=2006|accessdate=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Over 60% of adults in the US prison system read at or below the fourth grade level
* 85% of US juvenile inmates are functionally illiterate
* 43% of adults at the lowest level of literacy lived below the poverty line, as opposed to 4% of those with the highest levels of literacy.

According to begintoread.com:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.begintoread.com/research/literacystatistics.html|title=Literacy Statistics|publisher=BegintoRead.com|accessdate=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two-thirds of students who cannot read proficiently by the fourth grade will end up in jail or on welfare.
* Three out of four individuals who receive [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] read on the two lowest levels of literacy.
* 16-to-19-year-old girls at the poverty line and below with below-average reading skills are 6 times more likely to have out-of-wedlock children than their more literate counterparts.

==Prevalence==
In the United States, according to ''Business'' magazine, an estimated 15 million functionally illiterate adults held jobs at the beginning of the 21st century. The [[American Council of Life Insurers]] reported that 75% of the [[Fortune 500]] companies provide some level of remedial training for their workers. All over the U.S.A. 30 million (14% of adults) are unable to perform simple and everyday literacy activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/naal/kf_demographics.asp |title=National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) - Demographics - Overall |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Center for Education Statistics provides more detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/NAAL/datafiles.asp |title=National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) - Data Files from the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy is broken down into three parameters: prose, document, and quantitative literacy. Each parameter has four levels: below basic, basic, intermediate, and proficient.  For prose literacy, for example, a below basic level of literacy means that a person can look at a short piece of text to get a small piece of uncomplicated information, while a person who is below basic in quantitative literacy would be able to do simple addition. In the US, 14% of the adult population is at the "below basic" level for prose literacy; 12% are at the "below basic" level for document literacy; and 22% are at that level for quantitative literacy. Only 13% of the population is proficient in these three areas—able to compare viewpoints in two editorials; interpret a table about blood pressure, age, and physical activity; or compute and compare the cost per ounce of food items.

The UK government's Department for Education reported in 2006 that 47% of school children left school at age 16 without having achieved a basic level in functional mathematics, and 42% fail to achieve a basic level of functional English.{{not in citation given|date=May 2018}} Every year, 100,000 pupils leave school functionally illiterate in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kirsty Scott |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/egweekly/story/0,,2122125,00.html |title=Sounds incredible |publisher=Education.guardian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Russia, where more than 99% percent of the population is technically literate, only one third of high school graduates can comprehend the content of scientific and literary texts, according to a 2015 study.&lt;ref name="NKJ201506"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ludmila|last=Yasukova|url=https://www.nkj.ru/archive/articles/26453/ | title=Illiteracy — why? (In Russian) |publisher=''Nauka i Zhizn'' (Science and Life) |year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research findings==
A Literacy at Work study, published by the Northeast Institute in 2001, found that business losses attributed to basic skill deficiencies run into billions of dollars a year due to low productivity, errors, and accidents attributed to functional illiteracy.

[[Sociology|Sociological]] research has demonstrated that countries with lower levels of functional illiteracy among their adult populations tend to be those with the highest levels of [[scientific literacy]] among the lower stratum of young people nearing the end of their formal academic studies. This correspondence suggests that the capacity of schools to ensure students attain the functional literacy required to comprehend the basic texts and documents associated with competent citizenship contributes to a society's level of civic literacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sase.org/conf2001/papers/milner_henry.pdf SASE - Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629215446/http://www.sase.org/conf2001/papers/milner_henry.pdf |date=2006-06-29 }} — Civic Literacy: How Informed Citizens Make Democracy Work Henry Milner, Umeå University and Université Laval, accessed May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor '''Glen Francis Newey''' (1961 - 30 September 2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2017/10/02/thomas-jones/glen-newey-1961-2017/|title=Thomas Jones: Glen Newey 1961-2017|website=lrb.co.uk|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/12/glen-newey-obituary|title=Glen Newey obituary|first=John|last=Horton|date=12 October 2017|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[political philosopher]], last acting as a Professor of Practical Philosophy at the [http://www.hum.leiden.edu/philosophy/news-agenda/glen-newey-appointed-professor-of-practical-philosophy.html University of Leiden]. He previously worked in Brussels and until 2011 was Professor in the School of Politics, International Relations &amp; Philosophy at [[Keele University]], Staffordshire, England. He was a prominent member of the "Realist" school of political philosophers which also includes such figures as [[Bernard Williams]], [[John N. Gray]], and [[Raymond Geuss]]. Newey also wrote extensively about toleration, casting doubt on whether it remains a coherent political ideal in modern liberal-democratic societies.

Newey blogged regularly for the London Review of Books on a range of topics including UK and overseas politics, university politics, finance and culture, taking a strongly critical stance against free-market [[capitalism]] and the marketising of higher education. His journalistic articles were often informal in vein; in one article entitled ''As Useful as a String Condom''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n02/glen-newey/about-as-useful-as-a-string-condom|title=LRB · Glen Newey · About as Useful as a String Condom: Bum Decade for the Royals|website=London Review of Books|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newey criticised the [[British Royal Family]] as being of no use any more in modern Britain. His journalistic output also included film and theatre [[review]]s, as well as review essays on political and moral philosophy, and cultural criticism. He was also a strong defender of free speech and of [[academic freedom]].

== Background ==

Glen Newey was educated at [[Victoria College, Jersey]] and [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] where he studied History under the supervision of [[Richard Tuck]]. After graduating he worked for several years as a schoolteacher in Jersey. He completed [[Master of Arts]] and Doctor of Philosophy degrees at the [[University of York]], where his doctoral supervisor was Professor John Horton. Before working at [[Keele University]], Newey had taught at the [[University of Sussex]], [[University of Strathclyde]], [[University of York]], [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]] and the [[University of Oxford]].

== Area of specialisation ==

Glen Newey's main research interests were in [[political philosophy]]. His work focuses on toleration, the nature of politics, political morality, including the ethics of deception in public life, security, freedom of speech, and the political theory of Thomas Hobbes. He argues that modern liberalism, as defended by John Rawls and his followers, sidelines politics in favour of a moralised account of public life. Latterly, his work concentrated upon the relationship between security and other political concepts, as well as the nature of politics and the relation between freedom and justice. Political deception was another area of interest. Between 2008 and 2010 he was a research associate at [[Helsinki Collegium]].

Other areas of interest included the concept of security, freedom of speech, [[Hobbes]]'s political philosophy and the philosophical basis that political systems are built upon. His academic and journalistic output examined liberal views and develops an alternative to them.

== Death ==
Newey died on the 30th September 2017 in a boating accident in Rotterdam, Netherlands, involving multiple gas explosions.

The hypothesis is that the ingestion of gritty [[soil]] is the primary driver of [[hypsodont]] tooth development, not the [[silica]]-rich composition of [[grass]], as was previously thought.&lt;ref name="jardine2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jardine|first1=Phillip E.|last2=Janis|first2=Christine M.|last3=Sahney|first3=Sarda|last4=Benton|first4=Michael J.|authorlink4 = Michael Benton|title=Grit not grass: Concordant patterns of early origin of hypsodonty in Great Plains ungulates and Glires|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|date=2012|volume=365-366|pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2012.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional Coevolution Hypothesis==
Since the morphology of the hypsodont tooth is suited to a more abrasive diet, hypsodonty was thought to have evolved concurrently with the spread of [[grasslands]]. During the [[Cretaceous]] Period (145-66 million years ago), the Great Plains were covered by a shallow [[Inland sea (geology)|inland sea]] called the [[Western Interior Seaway]] which began to recede during the [[Late Cretaceous]] to the [[Paleocene]] (65-55 million years ago), leaving behind thick marine deposits and a relatively flat terrain. During the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] epochs (25 million years), the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands. Existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread. The grasslands provided a new [[Ecological niche|niche]] for mammals, including many [[ungulate]]s that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets. Grass contains silica-rich phytoliths (abrasive granules), which wear away dental tissue more quickly. So the spread of grasslands was linked to the development of high-crowned (hypsodont) teeth in grazers.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

==Modern Evolutionary Hypothesis==
===Early Evidence===
In 2006 Strömberg examined the independent acquisition of high-crowned cheek teeth (hypsodonty) in several ungulate lineages (e.g., [[camelid]]s, [[equid]]s, rhinoceroses) from the early to middle Miocene of North America, which had been classically linked to the spread of grasslands She showed habitats dominated by [[C3 carbon fixation|C3 grasses]] (cool-season grasses) were established in the [[Central Great Plains]] by early late [[Arikareean]] (≥21.9 Million years ago), at least 4 million years prior to the emergence of hypsodonty in [[Equidae]].&lt;ref name="Stromberg2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Caroline A. E. Strömberg | year=2006 | title=Evolution of hypsodonty in equids: testing a hypothesis of adaptation | journal=Paleobiology | volume=32 | pages=236–258|url=http://depts.washington.edu/strmbrgl/StrombergLab_website/Publications_files/Stromberg_2006.pdf | doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2006)32[236:eohiet]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Mendoza and Palmqvist determined the relative importance of grass consumption and open habitat foraging in the development of hypsodont teeth using a dataset of 134 species of [[artiodactyl]]s and [[perissodactyl]]s. The results suggested that high-crowned teeth represent are adapted for a particular feeding environment, not diet preference. &lt;ref name="MendozaPalmqvist2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mendoza|first1=M.|last2=Palmqvist|first2=P.|title=Hypsodonty in ungulates: an adaptation for grass consumption or for foraging in open habitat?|journal=Journal of Zoology|date=February 2008|volume=274|issue=2|pages=134–142|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00365.x|url=http://webpersonal.uma.es/de/ppb/Hypsodonty%20in%20ungulates.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphology===
Further, examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open, gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes.&lt;ref name="MendozaPalmqvist2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BilletBlondelMuizon2009"&gt;{{Citation | author=Billet, Blondel, and Muizon | title=Dental microwear analysis of notoungulates (Mammalia) from Salla (Late Oligocene, Bolivia) and discussion on their precocious hypsodonty| journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2009.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of dental microwear patterns of hypsodont [[notoungulates]] from the Late Oligocene Salla Beds of Bolivia showed shearing movements are associated with a diet rich in tough plants, not necessarily grasses. That the relationship between high-crowned mammals and the source of tooth wear in the fossil record may not be straightforward, hence the spread of grasslands in South America, traditionally linked with the development of notoungulate hypsodonty, is in question.&lt;ref name="BilletBlondelMuizon2009" /&gt;

Observations of hypsodonty development in Cenozoic mammals is also supported by the evolution of hypsodonty in other groups. For example, [[hadrosaurs]], a group of herbivorous [[dinosaurs]], likely grazed on low-lying vegetation and microwear patterns show that their diet contained an abrasive material, such as grit or silica. Grasses had evolved by the Late Cretaceous, but were not particularly common, so this study concluded that grass probably did not play a major component in the hadrosaur's diet.&lt;ref name="AP0629"&gt;{{Citation  |title=Hadrosaur chowdown — grind, grind, grind |journal=Associated Press | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporal Discontinuity===
Most importantly, evidence has shown, that the development of hypsodonty is out of sync with the flourishing of grasslands both in North America and South America, where grasslands spread 10 millions years earlier.&lt;ref name="jardine2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BilletBlondelMuizon2009"/&gt;

==Hypsodonty==
Hypsodonty is observed both in the fossil record and the modern world. It is a characteristic of large [[clades]] (equids) as well as subspecies level specialization. For example, the [[Sumatran rhinoceros]] and the [[Javan rhinoceros]] both have [[brachydont]], lophodont cheek teeth whereas the [[Indian rhinoceros]], has hypsodont dentition. A mammal may have exclusively hypsodont molars or have a mix of dentitions. Hypsodont dentition is characterized by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=John J.|last2=Wyss|first2=André R.|last3=Charrier|first3=Reynaldo|author-link3=Reynaldo Charrier|title=South America's Missing Mammals|journal=Scientific American|date=May 2007|volume=296|issue=5|pages=68–75|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0507-68|url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v296/n5/full/scientificamerican0507-68.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kwan-Tufts"&gt;{{Cite web

'''Ignacio Matte Blanco''' (October 3, 1908 – January 11, 1995) was a [[Chile]]an [[psychiatrist]] and [[psychoanalyst]] who developed a logic-based explanation for the operation of the unconscious, and for the non-logical aspects of experience. In applying the complexity and paradoxes of mathematical logic to psychoanalysis, he pioneered a coherent way of understanding the clinical situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychoanalysis.org.uk/matteblanco.htm James S. Grotstein]&lt;/ref&gt; He has an international following that includes: physicists, mathematicians, cyber-scientists, psychologists, mathematical philosophers, neuroscientists, theologians, linguistics and literary scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Iurato,  Giuseppe. (2014) ''At the grounding of computational psychoanalysis: on the work of Ignacio Matte Blanco A general history of culture overview of Matte Blanco bilogic in comparison'', https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01023409 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Matte Blanco was born in [[Santiago (Chile)]]. He was educated in Chile and qualified there as a medical doctor. He entered psychoanalysis with Fernando Allende Navarro, Latin America's first qualified psychoanalyst. Having moved to [[London]] in 1933, he trained in psychiatry at South London's [[Maudsley Hospital]] and in psychoanalysis at the [[British Psychoanalytical Society]] where he was supervised by [[Anna Freud]] and [[James Strachey]], becoming a member of the British Society in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/matte-blanco-ignacio "Matte-Blanco, Ignacio"]&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently worked in the [[United States]], from 1940. He returned to Chile in 1943 where he co-founded the Psychoanalytic Society. In 1966 he travelled to [[Italy]], never to return to his homeland. He settled in [[Rome]] with his family. He died there at the age of 86.

==The unconscious==
Matte Blanco's hypothesis proposes that in the unconscious "a part can represent the whole" and that "past, present, and future are all the same"'.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1996), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; He set out to examine the five characteristics of the unconscious that [[Freud]] had outlined: timelessness, [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]], condensation, replacement of external by internal reality, and absence of mutual contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;West, Marcus. ''Feeling, Being and the Sense of Self'' (London 2007) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Matte Blanco hypothesized the nature of unconscious logic, as opposed to conscious [[logic]]. He deduced that if the unconscious has consistent characteristics it must follow rules, or there would be chaos.  However the nature of these hypothetical characteristics indicates that their rules differ from conventional logic.

In his work ''The Unconscious as Infinite Sets'', Matte Blanco proposes that the structure of the unconscious can be summarised by the principles of Generalisation and of Symmetry: 1) The principle of Generalization: here logic does not take account of individuals as such, it deals with them only as members of classes, and of classes of classes. 2) The principle of Symmetry: here the logic treats the converse of any relation as identical to it; that is, it deals with relationships as symmetrical'.&lt;ref&gt;Matte Blanco, I. (1975) ''The Unconscious as Infinite Sets.'' London: Karmac&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/matte-blanco-ignacio "Matte-Blanco, Ignacio"]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the principle of Generalisation might be compatible with conventional logic, discontinuity is introduced by the principle of Symmetry under which relationships are treated as symmetrical, or reversible.  Whereas asymmetrical thinking distinguishes individuals from one another by the relationship between them, reality testing, symmetrical thinking, by contrast, sees relations as holding indiscriminately across a field of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Parsons, ''The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes'' (London 2000) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an asymmetrical relationship, X is greater than Y, becomes reversible so that Y is simultaneously greater and smaller than X. Matte Blanco draws here on [[Melanie Klein|Klein]]'s understanding that "I am angry (with a person or thing)" as very close to "Someone or something is very angry with me";&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London, 1994) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed he suggests that Klein was the most creative and original of all those who have drawn inspiration from Freud, highlighting in particular her famous concept of [[projective identification]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Rayner/David Tuckett, "An Introduction", Igancio Matte Blanco, ''Thinking, Feeling and Being'' (1988) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

For Matte Blanco, "unconsciousness" is marked by ''symmetry'', where there is a tendency towards 'sameness' and likewise, an implicit aversion to 'difference', while the quality of ego-functioning registers and bears difference, in a sense he called ''asymmetry'' .&lt;ref&gt;West, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

==The symmetrical and the asymmetrical==
Matte Blanco divided the unconscious into two modes of being: the symmetrical and the asymmetrical. Asymmetrical relations are relations that are non reversible. For example, “Jack reads the newspaper” cannot be reversed to the newspaper reading Jack. In this way, asymmetrical relations are logical relations and underlie everyday logic and common sense. They govern the conscious sphere of the human mind. Symmetrical relations, on the other hand, move in both directions simultaneously. For example, 'Daniel sits on a stone' can be reversed as, 'a stone sits on Daniel', without being untrue. Symmetrical relations, govern the unconscious mind. Matte Blanco states that the symmetrical, unconscious realm is the natural state of man and is a massive and infinite presence while the asymmetrical, conscious realm is a small product of it. This is why the principle of symmetry is all-encompassing and can dissolve all logic, leading to the asymmetrical relations perfectly symmetrical.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Paul. “Unconscious Process: Zen and Psychoanalytic Versions.” Journal of Religion and Health 39.1 (2000): 57-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

To show the illogical nature of symmetry, Matte Blanco said: "In the thought system of symmetry, time does not exist. An event that occurred yesterday can also occur today or tomorrow. Traumatic events of the past are not only seen in the unconscious as ever present and permanently happening but also about to happen."&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Fink, in Casement, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; He said that "We are always, in a given mental product, confronted by a mixture of the logic of the unconscious with that of the preconscious and consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;Matte Blanco, I. (1988) ''Thinking, Feeling and Being'' London and New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;  Matte Blanco gives this mixture of two logics the name bi-logic and points out that our thinking is usually bi-logical, expressing the both types of logic to differing extents.

==Strata==
Matte Blanco saw in-depth analysis of the mind as falling into five broad strata: in which there is a particular combination of symmetrical and asymmetrical logic' appropriate to each one.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner/Tuckett, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In what he terms the ''first stratum'', experience is characterized by the conscious awareness of separate objects. At this level thinking is mostly delimited and asymmetrical — closest to "normal", everyday life, to what [[W. R. Bion]] termed the mind of the "work group"...anchored to a sophisticated and rational level of behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Rayer/Tuckett, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Bion, ''Experiences in Groups'' (London 1980) p. 98 and p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;
A ''second stratum'' can be defined by the appearance of a significant amount of symmetrization within otherwise asymmetrical thinking, so that for example a man [[Falling in love|in love]] will attribute to the beloved young woman...''all'' the characteristics of the class of beloved woman, but (bi-logically) he will realize that his young woman also has limitations and defects.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner/Tuckett, p. 23-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The next deeper, ''third stratum'' is one where different classes are identified (thus containing a fair amount of asymmetrical thinking) but in which...parts of a class are always taken as the whole class — symmetrization (plus a degree of timelessness).&lt;ref&gt;Rayner/Tuckett, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The ''fourth stratum'' is defined by the fact that there is formation of wider classes which are also symmetrized, while asymmetry becomes less and less. Thus because "being a man" is a wider class than ones men, women and children, being a man is also equivalent to being a woman and a child. In this fourth and rather deep stratum, a number of the features of the Freudian unconscious are also characteristic. There is an absence of contradiction, also an identity of psychical and external reality.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner/Tuckett, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the deepest, ''fifth stratum'' is that in which processes of symmetrization tend towards the mathematical limit of ''indivisibility'' thinking, which requires asymmetrical relations, is greatly impaired and becomes the realm of psychotic functioning: without asymmetrical logic, play breaks down into [[delusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Rayner/Tuckett, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, in Parsons, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Normal human development for Matte Blanco, involved gradual familiarity with all five strata, including the capacity both to differentiate and to move between them all; in abnormal states, this continuity of differentiation between the strata becomes fractured or confused.&lt;ref&gt;N. G. Rucker/K. L. Lombardi, ''Subject Relations'' (1998) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, asymmetrical thoughts are said to be at the surface, while the symmetrical relations make up multiple lower strata that go deeper until an “invisible mode” or total symmetry is reached.  In the deeper, completely unconscious levels, a statement such as “Jane is the mother of Jasmine” is equally valid as “Jasmine is the mother of Jane”. This statement reversal sounds preposterous to logical, asymmetrical, conscious thought, but the depth of the unconscious has its own rules. There, such a statement is true and incontestable. In this way, the principle of symmetry changes the asymmetrical to symmetrical or, put another way, the logical into the illogical.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Paul. “Unconscious Process: Zen and Psychoanalytic Versions.” Journal of Religion and Health 39.1 (2000): 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Matte Blanco hoped that his logical underpinning of the unconscious would contribute to development in other areas of knowledge, apart from psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, E. (1995) ''Unconscious Logic: An Introduction to Matte Blanco's Bi-logic and Its Uses''. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; There are applications in theology.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford, R. (1999) ''The Symmetry of God.'' London: [[Free Association Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other applications can be found in art and literature. A number of writers have explored parallels between the work of Matte Blanco and of [[Gregory Bateson]] including Margaret Arden, [[Horacio Etchegoyen]] and Jorge L. Ahumada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Arden | first = Margaret | title = Infinite sets and double-binds | journal = [[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]] | volume = 65 | pages = 443–52 | year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Etchegoyen | first = Horacio | author-link =

'''Jeong Dojeon''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 정도전, [[Hanja]]: 鄭道傳, 1342 – October 6, 1398), also known by his pen name '''Sambong''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 삼봉), was a prominent [[Koreans|Korean]] scholar-official during the late [[Goryeo]] to the early [[Joseon]] periods. He served as the First Prime Minister (or First Chief State Councillor) of Joseon, from 1392 until 1398 when he was killed by [[Yi Bang-won]], the fifth son of [[Yi Seong-gye]], the founder of the Joseon dynasty. Jeong Dojeon was an adviser to Yi Seong-gye and also the principal architect of the Joseon dynasty's policies, laying down the kingdom's ideological, institutional, and legal frameworks which would govern it for five centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Yeong-hee|title=Why people are so fascinated by Jeong Dojeon|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2984372|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|accessdate=2014-02-12|date=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Background and early career===
Jeong Dojeon was born from a noble family in [[Yeongju]] in what is now South Korea. His family had emerged from commoner status some four generations before, and slowly climbed up the ladder of government service. His father was the first in the family to obtain a high post. Despite all his difficulties, he became a student of [[Yi Je-hyeon]] and along with other leading thinkers of the time, such as [[Jeong Mong-ju]], his penetrating intelligence started to affect the Korean politics.

===Relationship with Yi Seong-gye===
Jeong Dojeon's ties with [[Yi Seong-gye]] and the foundation of Joseon were extremely close. He is said to have compared his relationship to Yi Seong-gye, to that between [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]] and [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]]. Jeong Dojeon's political ideas had a lasting impact on [[Joseon Dynasty politics]] and laws.
The two first became acquainted in 1383, when Jeong Dojeon visited Yi Seong-gye at his quarters in [[Hamgyong]] province. After Yi Seong-gye ([[Taejo of Joseon]]) founded Joseon in July 1392, he appointed Jeong Dojeon to the highest civilian and military office simultaneously, entrusting him with all necessary power to establish the new dynasty. Deciding all policies from military affairs, diplomacy, and down to education, he laid down Joseon's political system and tax laws, replaced [[Buddhism]] with [[Confucianism]] as national religion, moved the capital from [[Gaeseong]] to Hanyang (present-day [[Seoul]]), changed the kingdom's political system from feudalism to highly centralized bureaucracy, and wrote a code of laws that eventually became [[Gyeongguk daejeon|Joseon's constitution]]. He even decided the names of each palace, eight provinces, and districts in the capital. He also worked to free many slaves and reformed land policy.

===Conflict with Yi Bang-won===
After Joseon was established in July 1392, Jeong Dojeon soon collided with [[Taejong of Joseon|Yi Bang-won]] over the question of choosing the crown prince, the future successor to Yi Seong-gye ([[Taejo of Joseon]]). Of all princes, Yi Bang-won contributed most to his father's rise to power and expected to be appointed as the crown prince even though he was Taejo's fifth son. However, Jeong Dojeon persuaded Taejo to appoint his young eighth son Yi Bang-seok (Yi Bang-won's half-brother) as the crown prince. Their conflict arose because Jeong Dojeon saw Joseon as a kingdom led by ministers while the king was to be largely symbolic figure, whereas Yi Bang-won wanted to establish the absolute monarchy ruled directly by the king. Both sides were well aware of each other's great animosity and were getting ready to strike first. After the sudden death of Queen Sindeok in 1398, while King Taejo was still in mourning for her (his second wife and mother of Yi Bang-seok), Yi Bang-won struck first by raiding the palace and killed Jeong Dojeon and his supporters as well as Queen Sindeok's two sons including the crown prince, in a coup that came to be known as the First Strife of Princes. Taejo, who helplessly watched his favorite sons and ministers being killed by Yi Bang-won's forces, abdicated in disgust and remained angry with Yi Bang-won well after Yi Bang-won became the third king of Joseon, [[Taejong of Joseon]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

For much of Joseon history, Jeong Dojeon was vilified or ignored despite his contribution to its founding. He was finally rehabilitated in 1865 in recognition of his role in designing [[Gyeongbokgung]] (main palace). Earlier [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]] published a collection of Jeong Dojeon's writings in 1791. Jeong Dojeon's once-close friend and rival [[Jeong Mong-ju]], who was assassinated by Yi Bang-won for remaining loyal to [[Goryeo]] Dynasty, was honored by Yi Bang-won posthumously and was remembered as symbol of loyalty throughout the Joseon Dynasty despite being its most determined foe.

==Intellectual activity==
Jeong Dojeon was a major opponent of [[Buddhism]] at the end of the [[Goryeo]] period. He was a student of [[Zhu Xi]]'s thought. Using [[Cheng-Zhu school]]'s [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian philosophy]] as the basis of his anti-Buddhist polemic, he criticized Buddhism in a number of treatises as being corrupt in its practices, and nihilistic and antinomian in its doctrines. The most famous of these treatises was the ''[[Bulssi Japbyeon]]'' ("Array of Critiques Against Buddhism"). He was a founding member of the [[Sungkyunkwan]], the royal Confucian academy, and one of its early faculty members.

Jeong Dojeon was among the first Korean scholars to refer to his thought as [[Silhak]], or "practical learning." However, he is not usually numbered among the members of the silhak tradition, which arose much later in the Joseon period.

==Political thought==
Jeong Dojeon argued that the government, including the king himself, exists for the sake of the people. Its [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] could only come from benevolent public service. It was largely on this basis that he legitimized the overthrow of the [[Goryeo]] dynasty, arguing that the Goryeo rulers had given up their right to rule.

Jeong Dojeon divided society into three classes: (a) a large lower class of agricultural laborers and craftsmen, (b) a middle class of [[intellectuals|literati]], and (c) a small upper class of [[bureaucrats]]. Anyone outside this system, including [[Buddhist monks]], [[shamans]], and entertainers, he considered a "vicious" threat to the social fabric.

'''Johann Gottlieb Buhle''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbuːlə|lang}}; 29 September 1763 – 11 August 1821), German scholar and philosopher, was born at [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] and educated at [[Göttingen]]. He became professor of philosophy at Göttingen, Moscow (in 1804), and Brunswick. Of his numerous publications, the most important are the ''Lehrbuch der Geschichte der Philosophie und einer kritischen Literatur derselben'' (8 vols., 1796–1804), and ''Geschichte der neuern Philosophie seit der Epoche der Wiederherstellung der Wissenschaften'' (6 vols., 1800–1804). The latter, elaborate and well written, is lacking in critical appreciation and proportion; there are French and Italian translations. He edited [[Aratus]] (2 vols., 1793, 1801) and part of [[Aristotle]] (Bipontine edition, vols. I–V, 1791–1804).

In 1804 he argued that speculative [[Freemasonry]] arose in England between 1629 and 1635 through the work of [[Robert Fludd]], who had earlier been introduced to [[Rosicrucianism]] by [[Michael Maier]].

Buhle died at Brunswick.

'''John Niemeyer Findlay''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɪ|n|d|l|i}}; 25&amp;nbsp;November 1903 – 27&amp;nbsp;September 1987), usually cited as '''J. N. Findlay''', was a South African [[philosopher]].

==Education and career==
After reading classics and philosophy as a boy and at the [[University of Pretoria]], Findlay received a [[Rhodes scholarship]] to [[Balliol College, Oxford]] for the years 1924–1926. He completed Oxford's classics course, also known as "Greats", in June 1926 and stayed on for a fragment of a third year before returning to a lectureship appointment in South Africa. He later completed his doctorate in 1933 at [[University of Graz|Graz]], where he studied under [[Ernst Mally]]. From 1927 to 1966 he was lecturer or professor of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Pretoria]], the [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand, [[Rhodes University|Rhodes University College]], Grahamstown, the [[University of KwaZulu-Natal|University of Natal]], Pietermartizburg, [[Newcastle University|King’s College, Newcastle upon Tyne]], and [[King's College London]]. Following retirement from his chair at London (1966) and a year at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], Findlay continued to teach full-time for more than twenty years, first as Clark Professor of Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics at [[Yale University]] (1967–1972), then as University Professor and Borden Parker Bowne Professor of Philosophy (succeeding [[Peter Bertocci]]) at [[Boston University]] (1972–1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1955 to 1956 and president of the [[Metaphysical Society of America]] from 1974 to 1975, as well as a Fellow of both the [[British Academy]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He was also an Editorial Advisor of the journal [[Dionysius (journal)|Dionysius]]. A chair for visiting professors at Boston University carries his name, as does a biennial award given for the best book in metaphysics, as judged by the Metaphysical Society of America. Findlay betrayed a great commitment to the welfare and formation&lt;ref&gt;'"I owe to [Findlay’s] teaching, directly or indirectly, all that I know of either Logic or Ethics" (A. N. Prior).&lt;/ref&gt; of generations of students ([[Leroy S. Rouner]] was fond of introducing him as "[[Plotinus]] incarnate"), teaching philosophy in one college classroom after another for sixty-two consecutive academic years. On 10 September 2012 Findlay was voted the 8th "most underappreciated philosopher active in the U.S. from roughly 1900 through mid-century" in a poll conducted among readers of [[Leiter Reports: A Philosophy Blog]], finishing behind [[George Santayana]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and [[Clarence Irving Lewis]].

Findlay's autobiographical essay, 'Confessions of Theory and Life', is printed in ''Transcendence and the Sacred'', ed. A.M. Olson &amp; L.S. Rouner, Notre Dame &amp; London: University of Notre Dame Press, 1981, pp.&amp;nbsp;176–92.

==Work==

===Rational mysticism===
At a time when [[scientific materialism]], [[positivism]], [[linguistic analysis]], and [[ordinary language philosophy]] were the core academic ideas, Findlay championed [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], revived [[Hegelianism]], and wrote works that were inspired by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;"[My Gifford Lectures] ... represent my attempt to cull an eternal, necessary theosophy from the defective theosophic teaching of my adolescence" (''Studies in the Philosophy of J. N. Findlay'', p. 45). Findlay's Gifford Lectures also may well constitute the most comprehensive defense of the doctrine of the transmigration of the soul (reincarnation) in 20th-century academic philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]], Plotinus, and [[Idealism]]. In his books published in the 1960s, including two series of [[Gifford Lectures]], Findlay developed [[rational mysticism]]. According to this [[mysticism|mystical]] system, "the philosophical perplexities, e.g., concerning universals and particulars, mind and body, knowledge and its objects, the knowledge of other minds,"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as those of free will and determinism, causality and teleology, morality and justice, and the existence of temporal objects, are human experiences of deep [[antinomy|antinomies]] and absurdities about the world. Findlay's conclusion is that these necessitate the postulation of higher spheres, or "latitudes", where objects' individuality, categorical distinctiveness and material constraints are diminishing, lesser in each latitude than in the one below it. On the highest spheres, existence is evaluative and meaningful more than anything else, and Findlay identifies it with the idea of The [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Husserl===
Findlay translated into English [[Husserl]]'s ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logische Untersuchungen]]'' (''Logical Investigations''), which he regarded as the author's best work, representing a developmental stage when the idea of [[Bracketing (phenomenology)|phenomenological bracketing]] was not yet taken as the basis of a philosophical system, covering in fact for loose [[subjectivism]]. To Findlay, the work was also one of the peaks of philosophy generally, suggesting superior alternatives both for overly minimalistic or [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] efforts in [[ontology]] and for Ordinary Language treatments of [[consciousness]] and thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findlay also contributed final editing and wrote addenda to translations of [[Hegel]]'s ''Logic'' and ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]]''. In 2013 [[Oxford University Press]] added Findlay's Kant book to the list of works it now reprints on demand [http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198246381.do#.UcgOwiAo600]; and in 2014 [[Routledge Library Editions: Philosophy of Mind]] reissued Findlay's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] [https://www.routledge.com/products/9781138825635].

===Wittgenstein===
Findlay was first a follower, and then an outspoken critic, of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. He denounced his three theories of meaning, arguing against the idea of Use, prominent in Wittgenstein's later period and in his followers, that it is insufficient for an analysis of meaning without such notions as connotation and denotation, implication, syntax and most originally, pre-existent meanings, in the mind or the external world, that determine linguistic ones, such as Husserl has evoked. Findlay credits Wittgenstein with great formal, aesthetic and literary appeal, and of directing well-deserved attention to [[Semantics]] and its difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Joseph Galien''' OP (born 1699, [[Saint-Paulien]], [[France]]) was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] professor of [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at the [[University of Avignon]], [[meteorologist]], [[physicist]], and writer on [[aeronautics]].

==Biography==
Born at Saint-Paulien, near [[Le Puy-en-Velay]] in southern France, Galien entered the Dominican Order at Le Puy. He studied philosophy and theology at the Dominican institution in [[Avignon]] with such success that he was sent to [[Bordeaux]] as professor of philosophy as early as 1726. From the year 1745 on he held the chair of theology at Avignon, and from 1747 the chair of philosophy. He seems to have resigned his professorship in 1751 to devote his energies entirely to the study of meteorology and physics. Galien died in 1762 in the Dominican monastery at Le Puy, or, according to other accounts, in 1782 at Avignon.

==Publications==
He published ''Lettres théologiques touchant l'état de pure nature, la distinction du naturel et du sur-naturel, et les autres matières qui en sont de conséquences'' (Avignon, 1745); also the ''Explication physique des effets de l'électricité'' (Avignon, 1747).

But Galien's most important contribution was a booklet that he issued anonymously in 1755 at Avignon under the title "Mémoire touchant la nature et la formation de la grêle et des autres météores qui y ont rapport, avec une conséquence ultérieure de la possibilité de naviger [sic] dans l'air à la hauteur de la région de la grêle. Amusement physique et géométrique". The second edition of this booklet, this time with the name of its author, appeared as early as 1757. The change in its title renders it easy to discern what made the monograph so interesting. It was now called: "L'art de naviguer dans les airs, amusement physique et géométrique, précédé d'un mémoire sur la formation de la grêle."

==The airship==
After propounding his theory regarding hailstorms, Galien calculates how large an airship would have to be in order to transport an entire army with its equipment to Africa. His scheme was to construct a gigantic cubic vessel of good, strong canvas of double thickness plastered with wax and tar, covered with leather and reinforced in places with ropes and rigging; its edge was to be 1,000 toises (roughly 2,000 m), and each surface 1,000,000 sq. toises (approximately 4,000,000 m²) in area. In both length and breadth it would be larger than the city of Avignon, and would resemble a fair-sized mountain. It would carry 54 times as much weight as did Noah's Ark, and be capable of transporting an army with its artillery and provisions for a year.

The air being lighter at the summit of a mountain than at the level of the sea, by filling this vessel with the mountain air, it must displace, being on the ground, a mass of air of greater weight than that with which it was filledplus the weight of the craft and its cargo. This vessel would have to float in the atmospheric level of the "hail belt", as the atmosphere there is a thousand times lighter than water, while in the strata above this, into which the top of the cube would extend, the air is two thousand times lighter than water.

For the scientific principles of his proposal Galien relied on [[Francesco de Lana]], S.J. and perhaps also on [[Gaspar Schott]]. His chief claim to importance lies in the fact that the [[Montgolfier brothers]] were acquainted with him, or at least his booklet. His birthplace was very near to theirs and like Galien, the Montgolfiers began with meteorological observations; moreover, the elder of the brothers made a first ascension at Avignon in 1782. In aeronautical works Galien is, for the most part, unfairly treated; as the writers assume that his scheme was meant seriously, contrary to his statement given on the title page.

{{Zen Buddhism}}
{{Western Buddhism}}
'''Karl Friedrich Alfred Heinrich Ferdinand Maria Graf&lt;ref&gt;Regarding personal names, ''[[Graf]]'' is a German title, translated as [[Count]], not a first or middle name. The feminine form is ''[[Gräfin]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Eckbrecht von Dürckheim-Montmartin''' (24 October 1896 – 28 December 1988) was a [[Germany|German]] [[diplomat]], [[psychotherapist]] and [[Zen master]]. A veteran of [[World War I]], he was introduced to [[Zen Buddhism]] early in life. After obtaining a doctorate in psychology, he became an avid supporter of the [[Nazi Party]]. Following [[World War II]] he was imprisoned in Japan which transformed him spiritually. Upon returning to Germany he became a leading proponent of the [[Western esotericism|Western esoteric spiritual tradition]], synthesizing teachings from [[Christian Mysticism]], [[Depth Psychology]] and Zen Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fog.ccsf.cc.ca.us/~fgati/chapter10.html Frank Gati and Lana Gati, "From what does "the way" start? The "way" starts where ever you are; but to be on the "way", that is a different story. The law of accident." Chapter 10 of ''My notes on the "Search for the Miraculous" by Ouspensky (Using the Lebovian method)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Dürckheim was born in [[Munich]], the son of Friedrich Georg Michael Maria Eckbrecht von Dürckheim-Montmartin (1858-1939) and Sophie Evalina Ottilie Charlotte von Kusserow (1869-1959).&lt;ref name="Dürckheim-Montmartin Family Tree"&gt;[http://gw4.geneanet.org/cvpolier?lang=fr;p=karl+friedrich+alfred+heinrich+ferdinand+maria+karlfried;n=eckbrecht+von+durckheim+montmartin Dürckheim-Montmartin Family Tree]&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandfather was the Prussian diplomat and politician [[:de:Heinrich von Kusserow|Heinrich von Kusserow]] (1836-1900). His uncle was General Alfred Karl Nikolaus Alexander Eckbrecht von Dürckheim-Montmartin (1850-1912), [[aide-de-camp]] to [[King Ludwig II of Bavaria]] and later commander of the [[Royal Bavarian Infantry Lifeguards Regiment]].

A descendant of old [[Bavaria]]n nobility whose parents' fortune was lost during bad economic times, he grew up at [[Steingaden]] and at the [[Bassenheim]] Castle near [[Koblenz]].

==Military service==
In 1914 he volunteered for the [[Royal Bavarian Infantry Lifeguards Regiment]] and was given a commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trimondi.de/Zen-Buddhismus/Duerckheim.htm Victor Trimondi, "Karlfried Graf Dürckheim"]&lt;/ref&gt; He served on the front lines for 46 months and fought in France, Serbia, Slovenia, Italy and Romania. He saw action at the [[Battle of Verdun]], the [[Battle of Caporetto]], the [[Battle of the Somme]], and the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Lys Offensive]]. By his own account he never fired a shot and was never wounded, "though bullets went through my shirt and coat."&lt;ref name="Erlebnis"&gt;Karlfried Dürckheim, ''Erlebnis und Wandlung,'' Bern, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Dürckheim considered his war experience fundamental to his later [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]: "I discovered...that it was in facing death that we step forward toward true life. That experience was later a part of my teaching: by accepting death, we discover and receive life which is beyond life and death."&lt;ref&gt;[http://authorsden.com/SampleWorksPDF/4581.pdf Alphonse Goettmann, ''Dialogue on the Path of Initiation: The Life and Thought of Karlfried Graf Dürckheim,'' Nottingham Publishing, 1998: p. 7.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of his military service, Dürckheim was awarded the [[Honour Cross of the World War 1914/1918]] and the [[War Merit Cross|War Merit Cross First Class with swords]].

==Introduction to Buddhism==
In 1919, as a twenty-three-year-old officer on his return after the war, he refused to fight in defense of the [[Bavarian Socialist Republic]], but instead joined the [[Freikorps]] under [[Franz Ritter von Epp]] (under whom he had served during [[World War I]]) and became involved in anti-[[Bolshevik]] activities, for which he was briefly imprisoned. Afterwards he worked for a time as a journalist for several small [[anti-communist]] publications.
He also rejected his inheritance of the family estate at Steingaden, to which he had a [[Primogeniture|right as eldest son]].&lt;ref name="Remmert"&gt;[http://www.seminarhaus-schmiede.de/pdf/duerckheim.pdf Günter W. Remmert, "KARLFRIED GRAF DÜRCKHEIM: Sein Beitrag zur Spiritualität."]&lt;/ref&gt;

He then met his first wife Enja von Hattinberg (1888-1939), who introduced him to the [[Tao Te Ching]] of [[Lao-Tzu]]:&lt;ref name="Goettmann"&gt;[http://www.stillnessspeaks.com/assets/books/1/Karlfried%20Graf%20Durkheim%20Becoming%20Real.pdf Alphonse and Rachel Goettmann, ''Becoming Real: Essays on the Teachings of a Master,'' Nottingham Publishing, 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|"I found myself in the workshop of the painter [[Willi Geiger (painter)|Willi Geiger]] in [[Munich]]. My future wife, Madame von Hattinberg, was sitting on the table, and next to her was a book...I can still see it now. I opened this book and read out loud the [[Tao Te Ching#Emptiness|eleventh verse]] of the Tao-Te-Ching of Lao Tzu. Suddenly it happened! I was listening and lightning went through me. The veil was torn asunder, I was awake! I had just experienced 'It'. Everything existed and nothing existed. Another Reality had broken through this world. I myself existed and did not exist...I had experienced that which is spoken of in all centuries: individuals, in whatever stage of their lives, have had an experience which struck them with the force of lightning and linked them once and for all to the circuits of True Life."}}

[[Meister Eckhart]] became very important for him. "I recognize in Eckhart my master, the master. But we can only approach him if we eliminate the conceptual [[consciousness]]."&lt;ref name="Goettmann"/&gt;

==Academic career==
Dürckheim received his doctorate in Psychology from the [[University of Kiel]] in 1923 and taught at the Institute of Psychology there for another year,&lt;ref name="Goettmann"/&gt; then went to work with [[Felix Krueger]] and [[Hans Freyer]] at the [[University of Leipzig]]&lt;ref&gt;Karlfried Graf Dürckheim, "Ganzheit und Struktur," (Festschrift z. 60. Geburtstage Felix Kruegers); München 1934 (Beck), Sert.: ''Neue psychologische Studien''; Bd. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; where he received his [[habilitation]] on 17 February 1930. In 1931 he became a professor at the [[Medical Academy of Breslau]]. From 1930 to 1932 Dürckheim also taught at the [[Bauhaus#Dessau|Bauhaus in Dessau]] in the field of [[Gestalt psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardo.info/isast/articles/behrens.html Roy R. Behrens "Art, Design and Gestalt Theory," ''Leonardo Online'', accessed 7-10-2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s he was close friends with [[Karl Haushofer]], [[Else Lasker-Schüler]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Romano Guardini]] and [[Rainer Maria Rilke]].

On 11 November 1933 Dürckheim signed the [[:de:Bekenntnis der Professoren an den deutschen Universitäten und Hochschulen zu Adolf Hitler#C.E2.80.93D|commitment of the professors at German universities and colleges]] to [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi]] state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://neu.inkrit.de/mediadaten/archivsonderband/AS205/AS205.pdf George Leaman, "Heidegger im Kontext," Berlin, 1993; p. 100.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nazi career and years in Japan==
In 1933 Dürckheim joined the [[Sturmabteilung]]. In 1934 he spent 6 months in [[South Africa]] on behalf of the [[Reichserziehungsministerium|Reich Minister of Education]] to contact Germans living there and to urge them not to abandon Nazism.&lt;ref name="Remmert"/&gt; During his visit he met secretly with the [[Afrikaner Broederbond]] to urge them to follow Nazi ideals, including [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcr.org/tcr/essays/EPrize_Apartheid.pdf Elizabeth Lee Jemison, "The Nazi Influence in the Formation of Arpartheid in South Africa." ''The Concord Review,'' 15.1 (2004): 75-103.]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1935 he had become chief assistant to [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], head of the [[Joachim von Ribbentrop#Dienststelle Ribbentrop|Büro Ribbentrop]] and later [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]]. In that year Dürckheim brokered a meeting between [[Lord Beaverbrook]] and Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Chisholm and Michael Davie, ''Lord Beaverbrook: a life,'' Knopf, University of California, 2009; p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1936 Dürckheim accompanied newly appointed Ambassador Ribbentrop to England, where he was assigned "to find out what the English think of the new Germany." He was introduced to [[King Edward VIII]] and [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://karlfriedgrafdurckheim.blogspot.com/2011/02/ma-intereseaza-fiinta-umana-in.html Cine este Karlfried Graf Dürckheim?] (in Romanian)&lt;/ref&gt; Dürckheim was at this time a fervent supporter of [[Nazism]], writing in the journal of the [http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_44923 Nazi Teachers Association]:

:"The basic gift of the Nazi revolution is for all occupations and levels across the experience of our common nature, a common destiny, the common hope of the common leader....which is the living foundation of all movements and aspirations."&lt;ref&gt;Karlfried Graf Dürckheim, ''New Germany German spirit - a collection of essays''; Japanese-German Cultural Institute of Niigata, Tokyo: Sansyusya, 1942, 170 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then it was discovered that he was of [[Jewish]] descent: Dürckheim's maternal great-grandmother Eveline Oppenheim (1805-1886) was the daughter of the Jewish banker [[Salomon Oppenheim]]. In fact Dürckheim was also related to [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]].&lt;ref name="Wehr"&gt;Gerhard Wehr, ''Karlfried Graf Dürckheim: Leben im Zeichen der Wandlung,'' Freiburg, 1996, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centre-durckheim.com/Durckheim.html Jacques Castermane, "Karlfried Graf Dürckheim et l'Orient transformé," The Dürckheim Centre.]&lt;/ref&gt; Dürckheim's grandmother was Antonie Springer,&lt;ref name="Dürckheim-Montmartin Family Tree"/&gt; who was also Jewish. Under Germany's 1935 [[Nuremberg Laws]] he was considered a [[Mischling]] (mixed-blood) of the second degree{{#tag:ref|[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/nurmlaw4.html ''The Reich Citizenship Law: First Regulation'' (November 14, 1935);] Article 2 states "An individual of mixed Jewish blood is one who is descended from one or two grandparents who were racially full Jews...One grandparent shall be considered as full-blooded if he or she belonged to the Jewish religious community." Such individuals were forbidden to hold public office.|group="Note"}} and had therefore become "politically embarrassing". Ribbentrop decided to create a special mission for him to become an [[envoy (title)|envoy]] for the foreign ministry and write a research paper titled "exploring the intellectual foundations of [[Education in Japan|Japanese education]]."&lt;ref&gt;This article was published in 1939 as "Das Geheimnis der japanischen Kraft," (The Secret of Japanese Power) in ''Zeitschrift für deutsche Kulturphilosophie''; N.F. 6,1 (Tübingen 1939).&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1938 he was sent to [[Japan]], residing there until 1947.&lt;ref name="Erlebnis"/&gt; Soon after arriving in Japan he met the Buddhist scholar [[Daisetsu Teitaro Suzuki]] who influenced his thinking profoundly.&lt;ref&gt;Karlfried Dürckheim, ''Der Weg ist das Ziel: Gespräch mit Karl Schnelting in der Reihe "Zeugen des Jahrhunderts".'' Göttingen: Lamuv, 1992; pp. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Fumio Hashimoto, who was sent to Dürckheim as a translator, wrote: "Dürckheim was surrounded by [[Shinto]] and Buddhist scholars, as well as military and thinkers of the right, each of which tried to convince him of their importance." These included such leading figures as the [[Abbot]] [[Hakuun Yasutani]] and the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] General [[Sadao Araki]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Daizen Victoria, ''Zen War Stories,'' Volume 21 of Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism; Psychology Press, 2003; p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; He became an avid student of [[Kyūdō]] (traditional Japanese archery) under the master [[:de:Awa Kenzo|Awa Kenzô]] (1880-1939), who had also taught [[Eugen Herrigel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/CriticalZen/The_Myth_of_Zen_in_the_Art_of_Archery.pdf Yamada Shōji, "The Myth of ''Zen in the Art of Archery''," ''Japanese Journal of Religious Studies,'' 2001:28/1-2.]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in 1941: "Archery is a great exercise that provides a profound silent concentration. In Zen the body is not considered an obstacle to spiritual life, as it is too often regarded in the West. On the contrary, [in Zen] the body is considered instrumental to spiritual advancement."

Under Ribbentrop's guidance, he coordinated the dissemination of [[Nazi propaganda]] in Japan, likening German military ideals to Japanese [[bushido]] and encouraging the idea that Japan and Germany would share the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/12150437 "Nazi Agents in Japan Rounded Up," ''The Argus'' (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848-1954), Thursday 1 November 1945, page 2]&lt;/ref&gt; The “Zen [[Samurai]] Bushido debate” had evolved in pre-war Germany over the relationship between Nazi ideals and those of the traditional Japanese warrior culture.

On 15 July 1939 Dürckheim published an article in the third issue of the journal ''Berlin - Rome - Tokio'' in which he refers to the [[Arahitogami|Japanese state cult]], the glorified “Samurai spirit” and its relationship with [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]] and [[antisemitism in Japan]]. He wrote:

:“Who travels today through Japan experiences at every step the friendship with Nazi Germany and [[Italian Social Republic|Fascist Italy]] to the Japanese people, especially those forces that affect the future more than political power. It is the spirit which connects Japan with us, that spirit which…is related to Japan’s iron will to win the war… In farm houses and businesses hang signs with the words: Everyone must behave as if they were on the field of battle.”&lt;ref&gt;''Berlin – Rom – Tokio Magazine'' issue 3, 15 July 1939, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1944 Dürckheim had become a well-known author and lecturer in Japan on [[Zen meditation]], [[archery]] and [[metaphysics]], and was awarded the [[War Merit Cross|War Merit Cross, Second Class]] on Hitler's birthday, 20 April 1944. The impending surrender of Germany led him to reconsider his values, however. "The immeasurable suffering of Germany will bring the German people to a higher level and help give birth to a better, less materialistic nation," he wrote to a friend in the last days of the war.&lt;ref name="Wehr"/&gt;

===Arrest and imprisonment===
After the war, [[Occupation of Japan|Tokyo was occupied]] by the Americans. Dürckheim went into hiding in [[Karuizawa]] and was arrested on 30 October 1945 by [[Special Agent]] [[Robie Macauley]] of the [[Counterintelligence Corps (United States Army)|US Counter-Intelligence Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;"Nazi Leaders in Japan in CIC Custody: 13 Hitler Operatives Nabbed Without Warning in War Criminal Roundup." ''[[Nippon Times]]'', October 31, 1945, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"26 Germans in Spy Ring Seized," ''New York Times'', Oct 30, 1945, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|In 1995 Macauley described Dürckheim inaccurately as "an authentic war criminal".&lt;ref&gt;Macauley, Robie, "Letters from the Front: Fiction struggles with a war's meaning," in ''Boston Sunday Globe'', 6 Aug 1995: Boston. pp. B33-B36.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} He was imprisoned for 16 months in [[Sugamo Prison]]:

:"In spite of everything, it was a very fertile period for me. During the first weeks, I had a dream almost every night, some of which anticipated my future work. In my cell I was surrounded by a profound silence. I could work on myself and that is when I began to write a novel. My neighbors simply waited for each day to pass. That time of captivity was precious to me because I could exercise [[zazen]] meditation and remain in immobility for hours."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gerhard Wehr, "The Life and Work of Karlfried Graf Dürckheim," in Alphonse and Rachel Goettmann, ''Becoming Real: Essays on the Teachings of a Master,'' Theosis Books, 2009; p. 29. {{ISBN|9780966496079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual rebirth&lt;!--'Transcendental realism (Evola)' redirects here--&gt;===
Dürckheim interpreted his imprisonment as an [[initiation]] event that was preparing him for a [[spiritual rebirth]]. Influenced partly by the work of [[Julius Evola]], the "conversion experience" later became an essential element of Dürckheim's psychotherapy: "There is real change whenever the individual experiences the [[supernatural]], which alters the [[meaning of life]] 180 degrees and moves the axis from the middle of the natural human existence to a supernatural center."&lt;ref name="Erlebnis"/&gt; The criteria of an initiation conversion are 1) the conscious confrontation with a near-death experience during one's lifetime; 2) the "overcoming of humanity"; and 3) the transition from the [[Everyday life|everyday mode of being]] to another, which Evola calls '''transcendental realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (the transition from the everyday mode of being to another [[spiritual plane]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Evola]], "Über das Initiatische", in ''Antaios'' '''6''': 184–209 ([[Mircea Eliade]] and [[Ernst Jünger]], eds., Stuttgart, 1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work with Zen and psychotherapy==
[[File:Prabhupada on a morning walk with Baron von Durkheim in Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|right| Dürckheim on a morning walk with [[Swami Prabhupada]] in Frankfurt in June 1974.]]Dürckheim was [[repatriated]] to Germany in 1947 and began a period of [[training analysis]] with [[:de:Leonhard Seif|Leonhard Seif]].&lt;ref name="Remmert"/&gt; At this time he began to develop his "[http://www.duerckheim-ruette.de/inhalt.php?DOC_INST=39 Initiation Therapy]", in which he merged several psychological directions. There is a strong influence from [[depth psychology]], in particular the [[analytical psychology]] of [[Carl Gustav Jung]] and the [[psychodrama]] of [[Jacob Levy Moreno]]. Dürckheim employs similar elements of art (modelling clay, ink drawings) and drama ([[role-playing]]) in his form of therapy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duerckheim-ruette.de/inhalt.php?WEBYEP_DI=38 "Initiatic Therapy," The Dürckheim Center.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with his second wife, psychologist [[:de:Maria Hippius Gräfin Dürckheim|Maria Theresia Hippius]] (1909-2003), Dürckheim founded the [[Existential Psychology]] Training and Conference Center in the early 1950s, located in the [[Black Forest]] village of [[Todtmoos-Rutte]]. His books were based on his conferences, and were highly influential in Europe and the USA.

:"What I am doing is not the transmission of [[Zen Buddhism]]; on the contrary, that which I seek after is something universally human which comes from our origins and happens to be more emphasized in eastern practices than in the western."&lt;ref name="Goettmann"/&gt;

In 1958 Dürckheim met philosopher [[Alan Watts]], who described him as "...a true nobleman--unselfconsciously and by a long tradition perfect in speech and courtesy--[[Hermann Graf Keyserling|Keyserling]]'s ideal of the ''grand seigneur''."&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan W. ''In My Own Way: An Autobiography 1915–1965'', Vintage, 1973; p. 321. {{ISBN|0-394-71951-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dürckheim is identified by Albert Stunkard as the person who suggested that Stunkard should visit [[D.T. Suzuki]] in [[Kita-Kamakura]], not far from the Sugamo prison.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Stunkard, "Philip Kapleau’s First Encounter with Zen", (Chapter 1) in ''Zen Teaching, Zen Practice: Philip Kapleau And The Three Pillars Of Zen,'' Weatherhill 2000, edited by Kenneth Kraft; {{ISBN|978-0834804401}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stunkard later became Suzuki's physician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenBookReviews/ZenteachingZenpractice.htm Vladimir K., "Zen Teaching, Zen Practice: Philip Kapleau and The Three Pillars of Zen," Zen Book Reviews on ''The Zen Site''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Other visitors to the Suzuki residence included writer [[J. D. Salinger]] and [[Philip Kapleau]], author of ''The Three Pillars of Zen'' and founder of the [[Rochester Zen Center]].

In 1972 Dürckheim received the [http://www.humboldt-gesellschaft.org/ehrungen/#E Humboldt plaque] from the [http://www.humboldt-gesellschaft.org/ Humboldt Society of Science, Art and Culture], and in 1977 he was awarded the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Officer's Merit Cross, 1st Class]].

Dürckheim died in [[Todtmoos]] on 28 December 1988 at the age of 92.

==Theory of therapeutic self-transformation==

Dürckheim did not practice psychotherapy in the traditional sense, rather, he tried to teach his clients a process by which they could move towards spiritual self-understanding. He viewed the therapist as a spiritual guide: "A therapy which does not take into account the [[spirituality]] of man is doomed to failure...The therapist is not the one who heals, that is, who intervenes with his own skills; he is a therapist in the original meaning of the word: a companion on the way."&lt;ref name="Goettmann"/&gt;

===Concept of the self===

Dürckheim readily acknowledged that he was influenced by other psychologists in the development of his theory of the self:

:"In these last twenty years, the work of [[C. G. Jung]] and of his disciple [[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Erich Neumann]] have greatly enriched me. Their [[Self in Jungian psychology|theory of "self"]] corresponds to my concept of essential being. For them the true self is the integration of the deep self with the existential one, which alone gives birth to the person. This is what struck me: C.G.Jung has opened the way to initiation."&lt;ref name="Goettmann"/&gt;

Dürckheim's "Initiation Therapy" deals with the encounter between the profane, mundane, "little" self (the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]) and the true Self:&lt;ref&gt;[http://lukestorms.com/tag/karlfried-graf-durckheim/ Luke Storms, "Tag Archives: Karlfried Graf Dürckheim, A Thousand Secrets."]&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Man evolves through three kinds of "self": first, the "little self" who only sees power, security, prestige, knowledge. Then the "[[existentialism|existential]] self" which goes much further: it wants to give itself to a cause, to a task, to a community, to a person. It can go beyond [[egocentrism]] and that is where it becomes, in my opinion, a [[human being]]. Finally what I call the "essential self," the true "I" of the individual and of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;Karlfried Graf Dürckheim, (1991 (1960)). ''The Japanese cult of tranquility.'' York Beach, Maine, Samuel Weiser; p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Wheel of Metamorphosis===

An integral concept in this self-understanding is referred to as "The Wheel of [[Metamorphosis]]." Dürckheim viewed transformation not as the sudden achievement of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], but rather as a continuous and cyclical evolution, akin to the motion of a wheel. He posited three stages and five steps in each cycle:&lt;ref name="Goettmann"/&gt;

*'''Stage 1:''' All that is contrary to essential being must be relinquished.
*''Step 1:'' Practice "critical watchfulness" ([[Self-awareness|analytical awareness of one's own thoughts and behavior]]).
*''Step 2:'' Let go of all that stands in the way of becoming.
*'''Stage 2:''' That which has been relinquished must be dissolved in [[Transcendence (religion)#Buddhism|transcendent]] Being which absorbs and recreates us.
*''Step 3:'' Union with transcendent Being.
*''Step 4:'' New becoming in accordance with the inner image which has arisen from transcendent Being.
*'''Stage 3:''' The newly formed core must be recognized and personal responsibility taken for its growth.
*''Step 5:'' Practicing this new form on a daily basis through critical watchfulness, which leads us back to ''Step 1''.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Theordore J. Nottingham, "The Wheel of Metamorphosis," in Alphonse and Rachel Goettmann, ''Becoming Real: Essays on the Teachings of a Master,'' Theosis Books, November 23, 2009; pp. 183-84. {{ISBN|978-0966496079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meditation===

For Dürckheim, [[meditation]] exercises are the key to spiritual change:

:"Exercise has a double purpose: to prepare the individual for the possibility of an experience of Being and for his metamorphosis into a witness of this experience awakening within. For illumination does not make an enlightened one! The more I penetrated into the experience and the wisdom of the exercise of Buddhism, the more it was clear that here was a universal understanding of the human being and his possibilities. This was a vision which, taking into account the liberation and salvation of man through health, efficiency and social fidelity, apprehended man in his deepest essence, whose experience and integration were also the conditions for the development of his true Self."&lt;ref name="Goettmann"/&gt;

==Quotations==

{{quotation|"The man, who, being really on the Way, falls upon hard times in the world will not, as a consequence, turn to that friend who offers him refuge and comfort and encourages his old self to survive. Rather, he will seek out someone who will faithfully and inexorably help him to risk himself, so that he may endure the suffering and pass courageously through it. Only to the extent that man exposes himself over and over again to annihilation, can that which is indestructible arise within him. In this lies the dignity of daring."
&lt;BR&gt;– from ''The Way of Transformation'', 1988.}}

{{quotation|"Perseverance can bring a state of ‘self-lessness’ in which you are released from the division of subject and object, which ordinarily dominates consciousness. In that state you can finally experience the perfect enjoyment of the unity inherent in it. You may even taste the joys of an experience which determines all further experience: ‘It is not I who am breathing, it breathes and I merely have a share as a union of body and soul.'"

{{quotation|"A great deal of my present work is in helping people who underwent great spiritual crisis during the war. We know, of course, that sometimes, in extreme circumstances, people have a natural ''[[satori]]'' or spiritual awakening when it appears that all is finished for them–and they accept it. This happened often in the war, and when those who lived through it tried to tell the tale to their friends it was shrugged off as some kind of [[hallucination]], a brief fit of insanity in a desperate situation. When these people come to me, as they often do, I have the happy opportunity of showing them that, for once in their lives, they were truly sane."

==Etymology==
[[File:Kawaii lolita manga.jpg|thumb|left|Cute manga drawing using kawaii basis (illustration by Daya Wyrd)]]
The word ''kawaii'' originally derives from the phrase {{lang|ja|[[:wikt:顔映し|顔映し]]}} ''kao hayushi'', which literally means "(one's) face (is) aglow," commonly used to refer to flushing or blushing of the face. The second morpheme is [[cognate]] with ''-bayu'' in [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%9C%A9%E3%81%84 ''mabayui''] (眩い, 目映い, or 目映ゆい) "dazzling, glaring, blinding, too bright; dazzlingly beautiful" (''ma-'' is from 目 ''me'' "eye") and ''-hayu'' in ''omohayui'' (面映い or 面映ゆい) "embarrassed/embarrassing, awkward, feeling self-conscious/making one feel self-conscious" (''omo-'' is from 面 ''omo'', an archaic word for "face, looks, features; surface; image, semblance, vestige"). Over time, the meaning changed into the modern meaning of "cute", and the pronunciation changed to {{lang|ja|かわゆい}} ''kawayui'' and then to the modern {{lang|ja|かわいい}} ''kawaii''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:かわいい|work = 語源由来辞典 (Dictionary of Etymology) |language=Japanese|url=http://gogen-allguide.com/ka/kawaii.html |accessdate = 20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:可愛い|work = デジタル大辞泉 (Digital Daijisen) |language=Japanese|url=http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/jn2/46843/m0u/%E5%8F%AF%E6%84%9B%E3%81%84/ |accessdate = 20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:可愛いとは|work = 大辞林第3版(Daijirin 3rd Ed.) |language=Japanese|url=http://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%8F%AF%E6%84%9B%E3%81%84 |accessdate = 20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly written in [[hiragana]], {{lang|ja|かわいい}}, but the [[ateji]], {{lang|ja|可愛い}}, has also been appended. The [[kanji]] in the ateji literally translates to "able to be loved, can/may love, lovable."

==History==
===Original definition===
[[File:JapaneseSchoolGirl-Sobuline-2011.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kogal]] girl, identified by her shortened skirt. The soft bag and teddy bear that she carries are part of ''kawaii''.]]
The original definition of ''kawaii'' came from Lady Murasaki's ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', where it referred to pitiable qualities.&lt;ref name="Shiokawa" /&gt; During the Shogunate period under the ideology of neo-Confucianism, women came to be included under the term ''kawaii'' as the perception of women being animalistic was replaced with the conception of women as docile.&lt;ref name="Shiokawa" /&gt; However, the earlier meaning survives in the modern Standard Japanese adjectival noun かわいそう ''kawaisō'' (often written with ''ateji'' as 可哀相 or 可哀想) "piteous, pitiable, arousing compassion, poor, sad, sorry" (etymologically from 顔映様 "face / projecting, reflecting, or transmitting light, flushing, [[blushing]] / seeming, appearance"). Forms of ''kawaii'' and its derivatives ''kawaisō'' and ''kawairashii'' (with the suffix ''-rashii'' "-like, -ly") are used in modern dialects to mean "embarrassing/embarrassed, shameful/ashamed" or "good, nice, fine, excellent, superb, splendid, admirable" in addition to the standard meanings of "adorable" and "pitiable."

===Cute handwriting===
The rise of [[cuteness]] in [[Japanese culture]] emerged in the 1970s as part of a new style of writing.&lt;ref name="kinsella"&gt;Kinsella, Sharon. 1995. "Cuties in Japan" [http://www.kinsellaresearch.com/new/Cuties%20in%20Japan.pdf] accessed August 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Many teenage girls began to write laterally using [[mechanical pencil]]s.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; These pencils produced very fine lines, as opposed to traditional [[Japanese writing]] that varied in thickness and was vertical.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; The girls would also write in big, round characters and they added little pictures to their writing, such as hearts, stars, emoticon faces, and letters of the Latin alphabet.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt;

These pictures would be inserted randomly and made the writing difficult to read.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; As a result, this writing style caused a lot of controversy and was banned in many schools.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; During the 1980s, however, this new "cute" writing was adopted by [[magazines]] and [[comics]] and was put onto packaging and advertising.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt;

From 1984 to 1986, {{nihongo|Kazuma Yamane|山根一眞|Yamane Kazuma}} studied the development of cute handwriting, which he called Anomalous Female Teenage Handwriting, in depth.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; This type of cute Japanese handwriting has also been called: {{nihongo|marui ji|[[:wikt:丸い|丸い]][[:wikt:字|字]]}}, meaning "round writing", {{nihongo|koneko ji|[[:wikt:小猫|小猫]]字}}, meaning "kitten writing", {{nihongo|manga ji|[[:wikt:漫画|漫画]]字}}, meaning "comic writing", and {{nihongo|burikko ji|[[:wikt:鰤|鰤]][[:wikt:子|子]]字}}, meaning "fake-child writing".&lt;ref&gt;Skov, L. (1995). Women, media, and consumption in [[Japan]]. Hawai'i Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was commonly thought that the writing style was something that teenagers had picked up from [[comics]], he found that teenagers had come up with the style themselves, spontaneously, as an underground trend. His conclusion was based on an observation that cute handwriting predates the availability of technical means for producing rounded writing in comics.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt;

===Cute merchandise===
[[File:Japanese kawaii doll.jpg|thumb|left|''Kawaii'' doll]]
{{nihongo|Tomoyuki Sugiyama|杉山奉文|Sugiyama Tomoyuki}}, author of Cool Japan, says cute fashion in Japan can be traced back to the [[Edo period]] with the popularity of [[netsuke]].&lt;ref name="theage"&gt;''TheAge.Com:'' "Japan smitten by love of cute" http://www.theage.com.au/news/people/cool-or-infantile/2006/06/18/1150569208424.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this growing trend, companies such as [[Sanrio]] came out with merchandise like [[Hello Kitty]]. Hello Kitty was an immediate success and the obsession with cute continued to progress in other areas as well. More recently, Sanrio has released kawaii characters with deeper personalities that appeal to an older audience, such as [[Gudetama]] and [[Aggretsuko]]. These characters have enjoyed strong popularity as fans are drawn to their unique quirks in addition to their cute aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Breed of Kawaii – Characters Who Get Us|url=https://www.umamibrain.com/single-post/2017/09/18/The-New-Breed-of-Kawaii-%25E2%2580%2593-Characters-Who-Get-Us|website=UmamiBrain|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s also saw the rise of cute idols, such as [[Seiko Matsuda]], who is largely credited with popularizing the trend. Women began to emulate Seiko Matsuda and her cute fashion style and mannerisms, which emphasized the helplessness and innocence of young girls.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://www.jref.com/forum/showthread.php?t=16924 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124094006/http://jref.com/forum/showthread.php?t=16924 |archivedate=2010-11-24 |df= }} URL accessed February 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The market for cute merchandise in Japan used to be driven by Japanese girls between 15 and 18 years old.&lt;ref&gt;''Time Asia'': Young Japan: She's a material girl http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990503/style1.html&lt;/ref&gt; No longer limited to teenagers, the spread of making things as cute as possible, even common household items, is embraced by people of all ages.

==Aesthetics==
[[File:Girls in Harajuku --- Kawaii?.jpg|thumb|Kawaii styled luggage]]
{{nihongo|Soichi Masubuchi|増淵宗一|Masubuchi Sōichi}}, in his work ''Kawaii Syndrome'', claims "cute" and "neat" have taken precedence over the former Japanese aesthetics of "beautiful" and "refined".&lt;ref name="Shiokawa"&gt;Shiokawa. "Cute But Deadly: Women and Violence in Japanese Comics". ''Themes and Issues in Asian Cartooning: Cute, Cheap, Mad and Sexy''. Ed. John A. Lent. Bowling Green, Kentucky: Bowling Green State University Popular Press, 1999. 93–125. {{ISBN|0-87972-779-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a cultural phenomenon, [[cuteness]] is increasingly accepted in Japan as a part of [[Japanese culture]] and national identity. {{nihongo|Tomoyuki Sugiyama|杉山奉文|Sugiyama Tomoyuki}}, author of ''[[Cool Japan]]'', believes that "cuteness" is rooted in Japan's harmony-loving culture, and {{nihongo|Nobuyoshi Kurita|栗田経惟|Kurita Nobuyoshi}}, a sociology professor at [[Musashi University]] in [[Tokyo]], has stated that "cute" is a "magic term" that encompasses everything that is acceptable and desirable in Japan.&lt;ref name=ap2006&gt;Quotes and paraphrases from: {{cite news|title=Cuteness a hot-selling commodity in Japan|author=Yuri Kageyama|date=June 14, 2006|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/14/AR2006061401122.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender performance===
Japanese women who feign kawaii behaviors (e.g., high-pitched voice, squealing giggles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merry White|title=The material child: coming of age in Japan and America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vom1N-653voC&amp;pg=PA129|accessdate=19 July 2011|date=29 September 1994|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08940-2|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that could be viewed as forced or inauthentic are called ''[[burikko]]'' and this is considered a [[Gender performativity|gender performance]].&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;"You are doing ''burikko''!: Censoring/scrutinizing artificers of cute femininity in Japanese," Laura Miller in ''Japanese Language, Gender, and Ideology: Cultural Models and Real People'', edited by Janet Shibamoto Smith and Shigeko Okamoto, Oxford University Press, 2004. In Japanese.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[neologism]] developed in the 1980s, perhaps originated by comedian {{nihongo|Kuniko Yamada|山田邦子|Yamada Kuniko}}.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

===Physical attractiveness===
In Japan, being cute is acceptable for both men and women. A trend existed of men shaving their legs to mimic the [[Neoteny|neotenic]] look. Japanese women often try to act cute to attract men.&lt;ref name="Bremmer" /&gt; A study by Kanebo, a cosmetic company, found that Japanese women in their 20s and 30s favored the "cute look" with a "childish round face".&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt; Women also employ a look of innocence in order to further play out this idea of cuteness. Having large eyes is one aspect that exemplifies innocence; therefore many Japanese women attempt to alter the size of their eyes. To create this illusion, women may wear large [[contact lens]]es, [[false eyelashes]], dramatic eye makeup, and even have an [[East Asian blepharoplasty]], commonly known as double eyelid surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=RiRi|first=Madame|title=Some Japanese customs that may confuse foreigners.|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/lifestyle/view/some-japanese-customs-that-may-confuse-foreigners|publisher=Japan Today|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Idols===
[[File:Japan Expo 2012 (3).jpg|thumb|[[Momoiro Clover Z]] performing at [[Japan Expo]]]]
{{nihongo|[[Japanese idol|Idols]]|アイドル|aidoru}} are media personalities in their teens and twenties who are considered particularly attractive or cute and who will, for a period ranging from several months to a few years, regularly appear in the mass media, e.g. as singers for [[Pop music|pop]] groups, bit-part actors, TV personalities (''[[tarento]]''), models in photo spreads published in magazines, advertisements, etc. (But not every young celebrity is considered an idol. Young celebrities who wish to cultivate a rebellious image, such as many rock musicians, reject the "idol" label.) [[Speed (Japanese band)|Speed]], [[Morning Musume]], [[AKB48]], and [[Momoiro Clover Z]] are examples of popular idol groups in Japan during the 2000s &amp; 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/culture/aj201208290008 |title=Momoiro Clover Z dazzles audiences with shiny messages of hope |work=[[The Asahi Shimbun]] |date=2012-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024003154/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/culture/AJ201208290008 |archivedate=2013-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cute fashion===
====Lolita====
[[File:Pink gothlolita.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Sweet Lolita]] fashion in Japan]]
[[Lolita fashion]] is a very well-known and recognizable style in Japan. Based on Victorian fashion and the [[Rococo]] period, girls mix in their own elements along with gothic style to achieve the porcelain-doll look.&lt;ref name="Fort 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fort|first=Emeline|title=A Guide to Japanese Street Fashion|year=2010|publisher=6 Degrees}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girls who dress in Lolita fashion try to look cute, innocent, and beautiful.&lt;ref name="Fort 2010"/&gt; This look is achieved with lace, ribbons, bows, ruffles, bloomers, aprons, and ruffled petticoats. Parasols, chunky Mary Jane heels, and Bo Peep collars are also very popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holson|first=Laura|title=Gothic Lolitas: Demure vs. Dominatrix|newspaper=New York Times|date=13 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sweet Lolita]] is a subset of Lolita fashion that includes even more ribbons, bows, and lace, and is often fabricated out of pastels and other light colors. Another subset of Lolita fashion related to "sweet Lolita" is Fairy Kei. Head-dresses such as giant bows or bonnets are also very common, while lighter make-up is also used to achieve a more natural look. Curled hair extensions, sometimes accompanied by eyelash extensions, are also popular in helping with the baby doll look.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fort|first=Emmeline|title=A Guide to Japanese Street Fashion|year=2010|publisher=6 Degrees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Themes such as fruits, flowers and sweets are often used as patterns on the fabrics used for dresses. Purses often go with the themes and are shaped as hearts, strawberries, or stuffed animals. ''Baby, the Stars Shine Bright'' is one of the more popular clothing stores for this style and often carries themes. Mannerisms are also important to many Sweet Lolitas. Sweet Lolita is not only a fashion, but also a lifestyle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This is evident in the 2004 film ''[[Kamikaze Girls]]'' where the main Lolita character, Momoko, drinks only tea and eats only sweets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitani|first=Koki|title=Kamikaze Girls|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416220/|publisher=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decora====
[[File:Rainbow Decora.jpg|thumb|upright|Example of Decora fashion]]
Decora is a style that is characterized by wearing lots of "decorations" on oneself. It is considered to be self-decoration. The goal of this fashion is to become as vibrant and characterized as possible. People who take part in this fashion trend wear accessories such as multicolor hair pins, bracelets, rings, necklaces, etc. By adding on multiple layers of accessories on an outfit, the fashion trend tends to have a childlike appearance. It also includes toys and multicolor clothes.

====Kawaii men====
Although kawaii is typically a female-dominated fashion, there are men who decide to partake in this trend. Some men decide to transform themselves into women, more specifically kawaii women. They are able to transform themselves by wearing wigs, false eyelashes, applying makeup, and wearing kawaii female clothing.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;{{cite web|last=Suzuki |first=Kirin |title=Makeup Changes Men |url=http://tokyokawaiietc.com/archives/9397 |publisher=Tokyo Kawaii, Etc |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721100514/http://tokyokawaiietc.com/archives/9397 |archivedate=21 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen predominately in male entertainers, such as Torideta-san, a DJ who transforms himself into a kawaii woman when working at his nightclub.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"/&gt;

Japanese pop stars and actors often have longer hair, such as [[Takuya Kimura]] of [[SMAP]]. Men are also noted as often aspiring to a [[Neoteny|neotenic]] look. While it doesn't quite fit the exact specifications of what cuteness means for females, men are certainly influenced by the same societal mores - to be attractive in a specific sort of way that the society finds acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennette|first=Colette|title=It's all Kawaii: Cuteness in Japanese Culture|url=http://geekout.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/18/its-all-kawaii-cuteness-in-japanese-culture/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way both Japanese men and women conform to the expectations of Kawaii in some way or another.

===Products===
The concept of ''kawaii'' has had an influence on a variety of products, including candy, such as [[Hi-Chew]], [[Koala's March]] and [[Hello Panda]]. Cuteness can be added to products by adding cute features, such as hearts, flowers, stars and rainbows. Cute elements can be found almost everywhere in Japan, from big business to corner markets and national government, ward, and town offices.&lt;ref name="Bremmer"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2002-06-24/in-japan-cute-conquers-all ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', "In Japan, Cute Conquers All"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cute Inc."&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.12/cute.html | title= Cute Inc.| publisher=WIRED|date=December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies, large and small, use cute mascots to present their wares and services to the public. For example:

====Non-''kawaii'' imports====
[[File:Kawaii goods.jpg|thumb|left|Kawaii goods outlet in 100 yen shop]]
There have been occasions in which popular Western products failed to meet the expectations of ''kawaii'', and thus did not do well in the Japanese market. For example, [[Cabbage Patch Kids]] dolls did not sell well in Japan, because the Japanese considered their facial features to be "ugly" and "grotesque" compared to the flatter and almost featureless faces of characters such as [[Hello Kitty]].&lt;ref name="Shiokawa" /&gt; Also, the doll [[Barbie]], portraying an adult woman, did not become successful in Japan compared to Takara's [[Licca-chan|Licca]], a doll that was modeled after an 11-year-old girl.&lt;ref name="Shiokawa" /&gt;

Kawaii has gradually gone from a small subculture in Japan to an important part of Japanese modern culture as a whole. There is an overwhelming amount of modern items featuring kawaii themes, not only in Japan, but worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jref.com/forum/all-things-japanese-26/research-paper-kawaii-culture-cuteness-16924/ (Research Paper) Kawaii: Culture of Cuteness&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118001552/http://www.jref.com/forum/all-things-japanese-26/research-paper-kawaii-culture-cuteness-16924/ |date=2013-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And characters associated with kawaii have an astounding popularity these days. We can see the "global cute" by the billion-dollar sellers like [[Pokémon]] and [[Hello Kitty]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Roach, Mary. "Cute Inc."

Japan has become a powerhouse in the kawaii industry and images of [[Doraemon]], [[Hello Kitty]], [[Pikachu]], [[Sailor Moon]] and [[Hamtaro]] are popular in mobile phone accessories. However, Professor Tian Shenliang says that Japan's future is dependent on how much of an impact kawaii brings to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epochtw.com/6/10/27/39668.htm 卡哇伊熱潮 扭轉日本文化&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301054943/http://epochtw.com/6/10/27/39668.htm |date=2013-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese Foreign Ministry has also recognized the power of cute merchandise and have sent three 18-year-old women overseas in the hopes of spreading Japanese culture around the world. The women are dressed in uniforms and maid costumes that are commonplace in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinataiwan.org/wh/sdgl/200904/t20090402_861472.htm|title=日本的"卡哇伊文化"_中国台湾网&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawaii manga and magazines have brought tremendous profit to Japanese press industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.huanqiu.com/asia/2011-09/1969974_2.html|title=“萌文化”在日本大行其道_旅游_环球网|first=|last=王力|website=go.huanqiu.com|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the worldwide revenue from the computer game and its merchandising peripherals are closing in on $5 billion, according to a [[Nintendo]] press release titled "It's a Pokémon Planet".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Influence upon other cultures==
{{tone|section |date=July 2013}}
Kawaii products are seemingly gaining more popularity beyond the borders of Japan into other Asian markets, and it's seemingly becoming more popular in the [[United States|US]], especially among the young anime and manga fans as well as among those who are influenced by Japanese culture. Cute merchandise and products are especially popular in other parts of [[East Asia]], such as [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Southeast Asian]] countries like the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="Cute Inc." /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/90086?tid=relatedcl|title=Cute Power!|date=7 November 1999|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sebastian Masuda, owner of 6%DOKIDOKI and a global advocate for kawaii influence, takes the quality from Harajuku to Western markets in his stores and artwork. The underlying belief of this Japanese designer is that "kawaii" actually saves the world.&lt;ref&gt;(Kataoka, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The infusion of kawaii into other world markets and cultures is achieved by introducing kawaii via modern art; audio, visual, and written media; and the fashion trends of Japanese youth, especially in high school girls.&lt;ref name="ebscohost"&gt;Tadao, T. (n.d). "Dissemination of Japanese Young Fashion and Culture to the World-Enjoyable Japanese Cute (Kawaii) Fashions Spreading to the World and its Meaning". ''Sen-I Gakkaishi'', 66(7), pp. 223–226. Retrieved from: http://search.ebscohost.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese kawaii seemingly operates as a center of global popularity due to its association with making cultural productions and consumer products "cute". This mindset pursues a global market,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. (2011). Re-framing "Kawaii": Interrogating Global Anxieties Surrounding the Aesthetic of 'Cute' in Japanese Art and Consumer Products. International Journal of the Image, 1(2), 1. Retrieved from: http://search.ebscohost.com/&lt;/ref&gt; giving rise to numerous applications and interpretations in other cultures.

The dissemination of Japanese youth fashion and "kawaii culture" is usually associated with the Western society and trends set by designers borrowed or taken from Japan.&lt;ref name="ebscohost"/&gt; With the emergence of China, South Korea and Singapore as economic centers in Asia, the Kawaii merchandise and product popularity has shifted back to the East. In these Asian markets, the kawaii concept takes on various forms and different types of presentation depending on the target audience.

=== In Asia ===
[[File:EVA hellokitty1.JPG|thumb|[[EVA Air]] Airbus A330 with a [[Hello Kitty]] livery]]
[[Taiwanese culture]], the government in particular, has embraced and elevated kawaii to a new level of social consciousness. The introduction of the A-Bian doll was seen as the development of a symbol to advance democracy and assist in constructing a collective imagination and national identity for Taiwanese people. The A-Bian dolls are kawaii likeness of sports figure, famous individuals, and now political figures that use kawaii images as a means of self-promotion and potential votes.&lt;ref&gt;[1]A-Bian Family. http://www.akibo.com.tw/home/gallery/mark/03.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the A-Bian doll has allowed Taiwanese President Chen staffers to create a new culture where the "kawaii" image of a politician can be used to mobilize support and gain election votes.&lt;ref&gt;Chuang, Y.

Japanese popular "kawaii culture" has had an effect on Singaporean youth. The emergence of Japanese culture can be traced back to the mid-1980s when Japan became one of the economic powers in the world. Kawaii has developed from a few children's television shows to an Internet sensation.&lt;ref&gt;[2]All things Kawaii. http://www.allthingskawaii.net/links/&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese media is used so abundantly in Singapore that youths are more likely to imitate the fashion of their Japanese idols, learn the Japanese language, and continue purchasing Japanese oriented merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;Hao, X., Teh, L.L.

Retrieved from: http://www.mediacom.keio.ac.jp/publication/pdf2004/review26/3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asian countries of China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Thailand either produce kawaii items for international consumption or have websites that cater for kawaii as part of the youth culture in their country. Kawaii has taken on a life of its own, spawning the formation of kawaii websites, kawaii home pages, kawaii browser themes and finally, kawaii social networking pages. While Japan is the origin and Mecca of all things kawaii, artists and businesses around the world are imitating the kawaii theme.&lt;ref name="ibukimagazine.com"&gt;Rutledge, B. (2010, October). I love kawaii. ''Ibuki'' Magazine. 1–2. Retrieved from: http://ibukimagazine.com/lifestyle-/other-trends/212-i-love-kawaii&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawaii has truly become "greater" than itself. The interconnectedness of today's world via the Internet has taken kawaii to new heights of exposure and acceptance, producing a kawaii "movement".&lt;ref name="ibukimagazine.com"/&gt;

The Kawaii concept has become something of a global phenomenon. The aesthetic cuteness of Japan is very appealing to people globally. The wide popularity of Japanese kawaii is often credited with it being "culturally odorless". The elimination of exoticism and national branding has helped kawaii to reach numerous target audiences and span every culture, class, and gender group.&lt;ref&gt;Shearin, M. (2011, October). Triumph of kawaii. William &amp; Mary ideation. Retrieved from: http://www.wm.edu/research/ideation/ideation-stories-for-borrowing/2011/triumph-of-kawaii5221.php&lt;/ref&gt; The palatable characteristics of kawaii have made it a global hit, resulting in Japan's global image shifting from being known for [[Japanese rock garden|austere rock gardens]] to being known for "cute-worship".&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt;

In 2014 the ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' in the [[United Kingdom]] entered "kawaii" into their then latest edition, defining as a "Japanese artistic and cultural style that emphasizes the quality of cuteness, using bright colours and characters with a childlike appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/29761389|publisher=[[BBC]]|title=Kawaii culture in the UK: Japan's trend for cute|date=24 October 2014|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chinese name|Kun}}
'''Kun Can''' (髡殘) (1612 to after 1674) was a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] painter from [[Hunan]] who spent most of his life in [[Nanjing]]. He became a [[Chan Buddhism]] monk at an early age and in Nanjing was abbot of a monastery on Niushou Shan. His style of landscape painting was influenced by [[Wang Meng (artist)|Wang Meng]] and he is one of the '''Four Monk Masters''' in the early [[Qing Dynasty]]. The others being [[Zhu Da]], [[Hong Ren]], and [[Shitao]]. As he was also known as Shi Xi he was at times said to be one of the "Two Shi". Few of Kun Can's works survive.

Unlike some of the other Monk Masters he seems to have become a monk well before the fall of the [[Ming dynasty]]. In personality he was noted for being frank and straightforward.

==Life==
Michał Twaróg studied at Paris in 1473–77, during the period when, following the [[anathema]]tization of the [[Nominalist]]s (1473), the [[Scotism|Scotist school of philosophy]] enjoyed its greatest triumphs there. He  brought [[Scotism]] to [[Poland]] and taught at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]] from 1485,  serving as its [[rector (academia)|rector]] in 1513–14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uj.edu.pl/dispatch.jsp?item=uniwersytet/historia/poczet.jsp&amp;lang=en  Past Rectors of the Jagiellonian University of Kraków] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710133051/http://www.uj.edu.pl/dispatch.jsp?item=uniwersytet%2Fhistoria%2Fpoczet.jsp&amp;lang=en |date=2009-07-10 }} Brief history at JU official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Twaróg was the author of many works of philosophy and theology revered by contemporary historians. As the [[abbot]] of the [[collegiate church]] in [[Wojnicz]] (1497–1520) he supported financially the functioning of the local hospital. A prominent student of Twaróg was [[Jan of Stobnica]] (c.1470–1519), a moderate Scotist, professor at the same Jagiellonian University (''Kraków Academy'') between 1498 and 1514, who took account also of the theories of the [[William of Ockham|Ockham]]ists, [[Thomist]]s and [[Humanism|Humanist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys dziejów filozofii w Polsce'' (A Brief History of Philosophy in Poland), [in the series:] Historia nauki polskiej w monografiach (''History of Polish Learning in Monographs''), [volume] XXXII, Kraków, Polska Akademia Umiejętności ([[Polish Academy of Learning]]), 1948.

'''Nachman Ha[[Kohen]] Krochmal''' (born in [[Brody]], [[Austrian Galicia|Galicia]], on 17 February 1785; died at [[Ternopil]] on 31 July 1840) was a [[Jewish]] [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galician]] [[philosopher]], [[theology|theologian]], and [[historian]].

==Biography==
[[Image:Krochmal More Nevuche.jpg|thumb|250px|Title page from '''Nachman Krochmal's''' ''Guide for the Perplexed of Our Time''.]]He began the study of the [[Talmud]] at an early age. At age fourteen he was married, according to the custom of the time, to the daughter of the wealthy merchant Habermann. He then went to live with his father-in-law at [[Zhovkva]], near [[Lviv|Lemberg]], where he devoted himself entirely to his studies, beginning with [[Maimonides]]' ''The [[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', and studying other [[Jewish philosophy|Hebrew philosophical writings]].

Krochmal then proceeded to study [[German language|German]] and the [[German philosophy|German philosophers]], especially [[Immanuel Kant]], to read [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]] classics, and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] books. After suffering a breakdown from overwork in 1808, he went to Lemberg for medical treatment; and the friendship he there formed with [[Samuel Judah Löb Rapoport|S.L. Rapoport]], whose teacher he became, was most fruitful for Jewish science. On his return to Żółkiew, after having partially recovered, he again took up philosophy, reading Kant, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]], and subsequently [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], whose system chiefly attracted him and exerted a great influence on his views. Aside from Rapoport, who often visited him in Żółkiew, he gathered around him a group of young students.

In 1814, after the death of his wife's parents, he was compelled to earn a livelihood, and he became a merchant. Twelve years later he lost his wife, and his health became very poor. In spite of failure in business, poor circumstances, and loneliness, he refused an invitation to the [[rabbi]]nate of [[Berlin]], and instead obtained a position as bookkeeper in Żółkiew, which he held from 1836 to 1838. A serious illness then compelled him to retire to his daughter's house in [[Ternopil|Tarnopol]]; and here two years later he died.

==Career==
Krochmal was a brilliant conversationalist and an exceedingly careful student. For a long time he could not be persuaded to publish any of the results of his studies, in consequence of aspersions cast upon him on account of his friendly correspondence with the ''[[hakham]]'' of the neighboring [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] community of Kokusow. Krochmal defended himself in a circular letter against these accusations.

He was not a prolific writer. Besides some Hebrew essays in periodicals (''Sulamith,'' 1818; ''Ha-Ẓefirah,'' Zolkiev, 1824; and ''Kerem Ḥemed,'' vols. iv., v.), he wrote only one Hebrew book, namely, ''Moreh Nebuke ha-Zeman'' (Lemberg, 1851), edited, according to the author's last will, by [[Leopold Zunz]], whom he admired as a great scholar though he never met. Other editions appeared in Lemberg in 1863 and [[Warsaw]] in 1898.

===Moreh Nebukhe ha-Zeman===
''Moreh Nebukhe ha-Zeman'' (''Guide for the Perplexed of the Time'') is divided into seventeen chapters, of which the first six deal with [[religion]] in general.

Ch. vii describes [[Israel]]'s spiritual gift as the desire for and faculty of seeking [[God]]. The next three chapters contain a philosophical analysis of [[Jewish history]], which, corresponding to Israel's attachment to the Lord, that is, to its religious development, is divided into three epochs. These epochs terminate respectively: (1) with the death of [[Gedaliah]] after the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]]; (2) with the death of [[Bar Kokba]] (ca. 135); and (3) with the expulsion of the Jews from [[Spain]] (1492). The author does not characterize the modern period in which he himself lived.

Ch. xi-xv deal with the post-exilic [[Biblical]] and the [[Apocrypha]]l literature and with the various religious movements. The author discusses also the necessity of tradition and gives a critical ''résumé'' of the development of the ''[[Halakhah]]'' and ''[[Haggadah]]''.

Ch. xvi gives a brief sketch of the future development of Jewish religious philosophy based on the principles of Hegel. The work finishes with an exposition of [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]]'s philosophy. The historical digressions in the book touch the profoundest problems of Jewish science; and it remains their indisputable merit to have paved the way for critical studies in Jewish history. The work really became, as intended by the author, a "guide" to students of Jewish science in the nineteenth century.

Octavian Goga and Nichifor Crainic were extreme examples and Volovici rightly highlights their deeds and writings.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Crainic was a contributor of poetry to the modernist magazine ''[[Gândirea]]''. After become disenfranchised with the publication progressive views, rather than disassociate with the magazine he became increasingly intertwined in leadership positions in order to de-modernize it. At the end of a series of intellectual sparing within the publication itself, Crainic managed to wrest control of the magazine and institute a sea-change in editorial character supporting mystical Orthodoxy.

He developed an ideology given the name ''Gândirism'' (from ''gând''&amp;nbsp;– "thought"), a [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and neo-[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] social and cultural trend. He edited ''[[Gândirea]]'' magazine, and collaborated with numerous other publications such as ''[[Ramuri]]'', ''[[România Nouă]]'', ''[[Cuvântul]]'', and ''[[Sfarmă-Piatră]]''. He was also the editor in chief of the newspaper ''[[Calendarul]]''.

Nichifor Crainic became a leading pro-Fascist figure in the political turmoil of the late 1930s, openly praising Mussolini and Hitler. He was an ideologue of [[Anti-Semitism]],&lt;ref name="finala"/&gt;&lt;ref name="finalb"/&gt; although his prejudice was a defense of the [[Gospels]] rather than a vision of [[Racism|racial hierarchies]]. His beliefs were a major influence on the [[Iron Guard]] legionary movement, although Crainic viewed himself as a supporter of the legionnaires' rival [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]. In a 1938 essay, he theoretised the "''[[Ethnocracy|ethnocratic state]]''" as applied to Romania:
:"''Our state has been a [[Kingdom of Romania|monarchy]] throughout its history. Monarchy is what gives this state its continuity. The crown of Romanian kings symbolises the greatness of the people and the permanence of Romanian awareness. (...)
:''The ethnocratic state differs profoundly from the [[Democracy|democratic state]]. The democratic state relies on population figures, without distinction of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or religion. The basis of the ethnocratic state is the Romanian soil and the Romanian kin. (...)
:''Today, people of other races and creeds live on Romanian soil. These have arrived here through the means of invading (as the [[Hungarian minority in Romania|Hungarians]] have), through [[colonisation]] (as the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Germans]] have), or through skillful infiltrations (as [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jews]] have). (...)
:''The Jews are a permanent danger for any [[nation-state]].''"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Crainic, ''Programul statului etnocratic''&lt;/ref&gt;
A fulfilment of ethnocracy was to be achieved through the means of a monarch-led [[Corporatism|corporatist system]]:
:"''Once popularised and accepted by the entire nation, carried out by government teams hand-picked from professional elites and controlled by [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], [a plan to redress Romania] will be overseen by His Majesty the King.(...)
:''The corporatist regime culminates in the kingly authority.''"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

{{quote|Crainic advocated creation of a Romanian spirit that was “antisemitic in theory and antisemitic in practice.” He applied his theological and rhetorical skills to breaking the Judeo-Christian relationship by arguing that the Old Testament was not Jewish, that Jesus had not been Jewish, and that the Talmud, which he saw as the incarnation of modern Jewry, was, first and foremost, a weapon to combat the Christian Gospel and to destroy Christians.|Friling, Ioanid and Ionescu, 2005|BACKGROUND AND PRECURSORS TO THE HOLOCAUST Roots of Romanian Antisemitism The League of National Christian Defense and Iron Guard Antisemitism The Antisemitic Policies of the Goga Government and of the Royal Dictatorship}}

In 1940 he was elected [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]]. He studied Theology at the Seminary in Bucharest, and received his [[Ph.D.]] diploma from the [[University of Vienna]].

He was appointed Minister of Propaganda for the Ion Antonescu regime.

After the Soviet army defeated the Germans and occupied Romania, Crainic went into hiding. A trial was conducted in his absence and he was found guilty of crimes against the people. He was eventually caught and imprisoned by the authorities of [[Communist Romania]] in 1947, and spent 15 years in [[Văcăreşti prison|Văcăreşti]] and [[Aiud]] prisons. He was expelled from the Academy by the Communist regime.

Between 1962 and 1968 he was the editor of the Communist propaganda magazine ''Glasul Patriei'' ("The Voice of the Motherland") - a magazine published in Romania by the Romanian Communist regime but sold only abroad, which they used as a tool to try to influence the Romanian intellectual émigrés to be patriotic and not work against the Communist Romania.

{{quote|Described by the historian Zigu Ornea as “always adaptable” (249), Nichifor Crainic (1889–1972) joined and left a number of these groups while repeatedly attempting to establish himself as an ideologue who could draw the various ultra-nationalist parties together into a united front. ... Crainic occupied senior positions within right-wing regimes between 1940 and 1944, and after he was released from prison in the 1960s the Romanian Communist Party used his talents and reputation as an informer and a “reformed” ultra-nationalist to add credibility to its regime.|Clark (2012: 108)}}

The '''Nuremberg International Human Rights Award''' is a German award founded on September 17, 1995. The date chosen is significant; 60 years earlier, the [[Nuremberg Race Laws]] were adopted. Also, on September 17, 1939, [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Poland was invaded]] by the [[Soviet Union]], soon after the [[invasion of Poland|German invasion]] that marked the beginning of World War II

The winner is endowed with 15,000 euros (20,235 USD).

The '''Odic force''' (also called '''Od''' [õd], '''Odyle''', '''Önd''', '''Odes''', '''Odylic''', '''Odyllic''', or '''Odems''') is the name given in the mid-19th century to a hypothetical [[vitalism|vital energy]] or [[Energy (esotericism)|life force]] by [[Carl Reichenbach|Baron Carl von Reichenbach]]. Von Reichenbach coined the name from that of the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[god]] [[Odin]] in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, William F. (2000). ''[[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience|Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy]]''. Facts on File Inc. p. 299. {{ISBN|1-57958-207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, Theresa. (2009). ''The Shadow of Enlightenment: Optical and Political Transparency in France, 1789-1848''. Oxford University Press. p. 113. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954470-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of Odic force is called ''odology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chrisomalis|first1=Stephen|title=O|url=http://phrontistery.info/o.html|website=The Phrontistery|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

As von Reichenbach was investigating the manner in which the human [[nervous system]] could be affected by various substances, he conceived the existence of a new force allied to [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], and [[heat]], a force which he thought was radiated by most substances, and to the influence of which different persons are variously [[Sensitivity (human)|sensitive]].&lt;ref&gt;Serge Kahili King, Serge King ''Earth Energies: A Quest for the Hidden Power of the Planet'' 1992, Chapter 3 The Odic Force and Reichenbach, pp. 38-60&lt;/ref&gt; He named this [[vitalism|vitalist]] concept ''Odic force''. Proponents say that Odic force permeates all plants, animals, and humans.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Coddington ''Seekers of the Healing Energy: Reich, Cayce, the Kahunas, and Other Masters of the Vital Force'' 1991, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Believers in Odic force said that it is visible in total darkness as colored [[Aura (paranormal)|auras]] surrounding living things, crystals, and magnets, but that viewing it requires hours first spent in total darkness, and only very sensitive people have the ability to see it.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Johannes Thiel ''The Diagnosis Of Disease By Observation Of The Eye To Enable Physicians, Healers, Teachers, Parents to Read the Eyes'' Kessinger Reprint Edition, 2004, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; They also said that it resembles the Asian concepts [[prana]] and [[qi]]. However, they regarded the ''Odic force'' as not associated with breath (like [[India]]'s [[prana]] and the [[qi]] of Chinese martial arts) but rather mainly with biological [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] fields.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Woodhouse ''Paradigm Wars: Worldviews for a New Age'' 1996, pp. 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Reichenbach did not tie Odic force into other vitalist theories. Baron von Reichenbach expounded the concept of Odic force in detail in a book-length article, ''Researches on Magnetism'', ''Electricity'', ''Heat and Light in their Relations to Vital Forces'', which appeared in a special issue of a respected scientific journal, ''Annalen der Chemie und Physik''. He said that (1) the Odic force had a positive and negative [[flux]], and a light and dark side; (2) individuals could forcefully "emanate" it, particularly from the hands, mouth, and forehead; and (3) the Odic force had many possible applications.

The Odic force was conjectured to explain the phenomenon of [[hypnotism]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Odylic force |volume=20 |pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], impetus was given to this view of the subject following the translation of Reichenbach's ''Researches'' by Dr. Gregory, professor of [[chemistry]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; These later researches tried to show many of the Odic phenomena to be of the same nature as those described previously by [[Franz Mesmer]] and even long before Mesmer by [[Swedenborg]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles R. Kelley ''Life Force... the Creative Process in Man And in Nature'' 2004, pp. 286-287&lt;/ref&gt;

The French parapsychologists Hippolyte Baraduc and [[Albert de Rochas]] were influenced by the concept of the Odic force.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Clarke, Linda Dalrymple Henderson ''From Energy to Information: Representation in Science and Technology, Art and Literature'' 2002, pp. 140-141&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Reichenbach hoped to develop scientific proof for a universal life force; however, his experiments relied on perceptions reported by individuals who claimed to be "sensitive", as he himself could not observe any of the reported phenomena. The "sensitives" had to work in total or near-total darkness to be able to observe the phenomena. Reichenbach stated that, through experimentation, possibly 1/3 of the population could view the phenomenon, but far less otherwise.

== Scientific reception ==

The concept of Odic force was criticized by the [[scientific community]] as there was no reliable or replicable data for its existence. In the 19th century it was described as [[quackery]] by critics and is regarded today as an example of [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Steavenson, William Edward. (1884). ''Electricity &amp; Its Manner of Working in the Treatment of Disease''. London : J. &amp; A. Churchill. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jastrow|Jastrow, Joseph]]. (1935). ''Wish and Wisdom: Episodes in the Vagaries of Belief''. D. Appleton-Century Company. pp. 341-349. (Published in 1962 by Dover Books as ''Error and Eccentricity in Human Belief'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radner, Daisie; Radner, Michael. (1982). ''Science and Unreason''. Wadsworth. pp. 24-29. {{ISBN|0-534-01153-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science writer [[Martin Gardner]] in his book ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]'' (1957) noted that "scientists were unable to duplicate the baron's experiments."&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, Martin]]. (2012 edition, originally published in 1957). ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''. Dover Publications. p. 345. {{ISBN|0-486-20394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Todd Carroll]] in ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]'' has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The baron had no training in psychology or psychopathology and no training in devising experiments involving people. He applied many standard scientific techniques and followed standard practices of data collection and recording, including graphs and charts. But he seems to have had no sense of how to do a controlled experiment with so-called "sensitives," people who might better be described as neurotics or delusional. ([[Joseph Jastrow|Jastrow]] says that for the most part, his subjects were "neurotic young women.") Given the fact that he deceived himself so thoroughly over such a long period of time, it seems reasonable to assume that he was (at the very least) unconsciously suggesting behaviors to his subjects. His enthusiasm for the project undoubtedly biased his subjective observations. That he came to think that the odic force could explain dozens of disparate phenomena, while being unable to convince other scientists that he had discovered anything, signifies the pathological nature of his investigations. Reichenbach's pursuit of the odic force is a classic example of [[pathological science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/reichenbach.html "Reichenbach's Odic force"]. The Skeptic's Dictionary. Retrieved 18 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scientists have abandoned concepts such as the Odic force. In western popular culture the name is used in a similar way to [[qi]] or [[prana]] to refer to [[Energy (spiritual)|spiritual energies]] or the [[vital force]] associated with living things. In Europe, the Odic force has been mentioned in books on [[dowsing]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Karl |last=Spiesberger |year=1989 |origyear=1962 |authorlink=Karl Spiesberger |trans-title=Reveal the Power of the Pendulum: Secrets of the Sidereal Pendulum, A Complete Survey of Pendulum Dowsing |isbn=0-572-01419-8 |title=Der erfolgreiche Pendel-Praktiker: Das Geheimnis des siderischen Pendels - Ein Querschnitt durch das Gesamtgebiet der Pendel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bible-related |interpretation}}

"'''Pardes'''" refers to (types of) [[Hermeneutics|approaches]] to biblical [[exegesis]] in rabbinic [[Judaism]] or to [[Zohar|interpretation]] of text in [[Torah study#Forms of traditional Jewish Torah study|Torah study]]. The term, sometimes also spelled '''PaRDeS''', is an [[acronym]] formed from the same initials of the following four approaches:
*[[Peshat|'''P'''esh'''a'''t]] ({{Hebrew|פְּשָׁט}}) – "surface" ("straight") or the literal (direct) meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=225&amp;letter=P Peshat] in the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''R'''emez ({{Hebrew|רֶמֶז}}) – "hints" or the deep (allegoric: hidden or symbolic) meaning beyond just the literal sense.
*'''De'''rash ({{Hebrew|דְּרַשׁ}}) – from Hebrew ''darash'': "inquire" ("seek") – the comparative ([[midrash]]ic) meaning, as given through similar occurrences.
*'''S'''od ({{Hebrew|סוֹד}}) (pronounced with a long O as in 'lore') – "secret" ("mystery") or the esoteric/mystical meaning, as given through inspiration or revelation.

Each type of ''Pardes'' interpretation examines the extended meaning of a text.  As a general rule, the extended meaning never contradicts the base meaning.  The ''[[Peshat]]'' means the plain or contextual meaning of the text.  ''Remez'' is the allegorical meaning.  ''Derash'' includes the metaphorical meaning, and ''Sod'' represents the hidden meaning.  There is often considerable overlap, for example when legal understandings of a verse are influenced by mystical interpretations or when a "hint" is determined by comparing a word with other instances of the same word.

Some books such as ''[[Tolaat Yaakov]]'', divide Pardes into Peshat, Remez, ''Din'' (law), and Sod.  According to this understanding, ''Derash'' is divided into the homiletics, which are classified under Remez, and legal interpretations, which are classified under Din.

==Context==

===Exoteric and esoteric in ''Sod''===
* [[Exoteric]] means that Scripture is read in the context of the physical world, human orientation, and human notions. The first three exegetical methods: ''Peshat-Simple'', ''Remez-Hinted'', and ''Drush-Homiletic'' belong to the exoteric "''Nigleh-Revealed''" part of Torah embodied in mainstream [[Rabbinic literature]], such as the [[Talmud]], [[Midrash]], and exoteric-type [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]].
* [[Esoteric]] means that the surface meaning of Scripture, as with esoteric texts in general, while it may also be true, is not the real truth to which Scripture refers. Instead, the surface meaning hides/covers/conceals its real intention. The real truth is the secret hidden within the deceptive covering. The fourth level of exegesis, ''Sod-Secret'', belongs to the esoteric "''Nistar-Hidden''" interpretations of Scripture found alternatively in [[Jewish mysticism|Jewish mysticism-Kabbalah]] or in [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophy-Metaphysics]]. Religious adherents of Kabbalah and of Rationalism fought over their alternative claims to know the esoteric meaning. In Medieval Jewish Rationalism, the hidden truth within Scripture was human-centred [[Divine transcendence]] philosophical depths. In Kabbalistic mysticism, it was God's Persona-centred [[Divine immanence]] emanations. Therefore, each tradition interpreted classic Rabbinic references to [[Pardes (legend)]], ''Maaseh Bereishit/Maaseh Merkabah'' ([[Talmudic]] passages about esotericism) and to the connected 4-fold structure of PaRDeS exegesis differently.

Both mystical and rational religious Judaism, however, together rooted in mainstream [[Rabbinic literature]] and [[Mitzvot]] observance, accepted common truth in ''Peshat'', ''Remez'', and ''Drush'' levels of Judaism. In this way, Jewish religious esotericism is inseparable from exoteric Judaism. Their esoteric meanings did not deny the truth of exotericism, but rather reinforced the need for exoteric [[Halacha]] Jewish law and practical observance of the [[613 Mitzvot]] as God's plan in Creation.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The mystical view of esoteric ''Sod-Secret'' as the elite doctrines of [[Kabbalah]] also gave conceptual context to ''Peshat'', ''Remez'', and ''Drush'': in the mystical unfolding of the spiritual [[Four Worlds]], each realm corresponds to a level in PaRDeS. God's immanence is found at successively descending levels of reality. Torah descends from on High, while man ascends the levels of PaRDeS exegesis in Torah from Below. In this sense, ascending the four levels of interpretation reveals greater divinity in Torah; the exoteric and esoteric are linked in a continuous chain. While rationalists read Rabbinic [[Aggadah]] legends metaphorically, kabbalists read them as allusions to Kabbalah.

===Halacha and Aggadah in ''Peshat'', ''Remez'', ''Drush''===
Within mainstream exoteric classic [[Rabbinic literature]], such as the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrashim]], [[Halacha]] is Jewish legal discussion and ruling, while [[Aggadah]] is Jewish theological/narrative discussion. As two approaches in exoteric Judaism, so ''Peshat-Simple'', ''Remez-Hinted'' and ''Drush-Homiletic'' exegeses methods, which work exoterically, can be used in either Halachic or Aggadic contexts.

==Examples==

===Peshat===
(Gen. 1,2) And the earth was empty (tohu) and formless (bohu).&lt;br /&gt;
[[Rashi]] - The Hebrew word 'tohu' means astonishment in English and the word 'bohu' means emptiness and next to emptiness. Thus the phrase is 'amazement and desolation'. This means that a person would be amazed and astonished at anything that was there.

===Remez===
'''Aggadic example:'''
&lt;br /&gt;There is a traditional Rabbinic passage describing spiritual history that relates the 6 days of Creation to the 6000 years the World will exist, and the Sabbath to the 7th Millennium Messianic Era. The first 2000 years of Creation from Adam, through Noah and the Tower of Babel, to Abraham were 2000 years when God was hidden. The next 2000 years from the Israelite Patriarchs, through the Giving of the Torah at Sinai, to the 1st and 2nd Jewish Commonwealths and Temples in Jerusalem, were 2000 years of Divine revelation. The final 2000 years of preparation when the [[Jewish Messiah]] is waited for, are 2000 years balanced between Divine concealment and revelation.

A Remez-allusion to this is found in the first verse of the Torah:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth''"&lt;br /&gt;בראשית ברא אלהים את השמים ואת הארץ.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Of these 7 words, only ''Hashamayim-Heavens'' has no letter א [[Aleph]], the first letter of the [[Hebrew alphabet]], numerical value of 1 ([[gematria]]). Aleph, hints at its etymological variants "Aluph" (Chief/Ruler) and "Eleph" (One Thousand), the first representing the 1 God, the second representing 1,000 years. Hebrew root words are generally made from three consonant letters, as vowels are read in pronunciation instead. Hebrew reads from right to left. Of the 6 words with Aleph in them in the verse: in the first 2 Aleph is positioned as third letter (concealed God in the first 2,000 years), in the next 2 Aleph is positioned as first letter (revealed God in the middle 2,000 years), in the last 2 Aleph is positioned as second letter (balance between concealed and revealed God in the last 2,000 years).

This is a Remez-allusion exegesis, but gains further meaning in [[Kabbalah]] Jewish mysticism (Sod-Secret exegesis) by the Kabbalistic doctrine that Creation was ennacted through the Hebrew letters of the Torah.

'''Halachic example:'''
&lt;br /&gt;(gemara makkos 2b) Q. A hint that the law of conspiring witnesses is in the Torah, where is it? &lt;br /&gt;
A. There is no such hint, because it is stated explicitly (Deut 19:19) You do to them what they conspired to do to the accused.

Q. But a hint that conspiring witnesses receive a whipping [if they cannot be punished by doing to them as they conspired] according to the Torah, where is it? &lt;br /&gt;
A. As it says (Deut 25:1–2) They caused the righteous to be righteous and the evil to be evil. And therefore the evil get whipped.

Q. Because they caused the righteous to be righteous and the evil to be evil. And therefore the evil get whipped? &lt;br /&gt;
A. But there must have been witnesses who testified that the righteous were evil. And other witnesses came and caused the righteous to be known as righteous as they were before, and caused the previous witnesses to be known as evil. And therefore the evil get whipped.

===Derash (Midrash)===
(gemara makkos 23b) Rabbi Simlai deduced that there were 613 [[mitzvot]] taught to Moses at Mount Sinai. The verse says that (Deut 33,4) Torah was given to us through Moses at Sinai. The [[gematria]] of Torah is 611. And one should add to them the first two of the [[Ten Commandments]] that were given directly by God to the Jews [this is known because they are written in the first person singular], making the total 613.

===Sod===
'''Maimonides:'''
&lt;br /&gt;In his ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', [[Maimonides]] wrote the most important book of Medieval [[Jewish philosophy]]. In it he declares his intention to conceal from the average reader his explanations of ''Sod'' &lt;ref&gt;Within [the Torah] there is also another part which is called ‘hidden’ (mutsnaʿ), and this [concerns] the secrets (sodot) which the human intellect cannot attain, like the meanings of the statutes (ḥukim) and other hidden secrets. They can neither be attained through the intellect nor through sheer volition, but they are revealed before Him who created [the Torah] (Rabbi [[Abraham ben Asher]], ''The Or ha-Sekhel'')&lt;/ref&gt; esoteric meanings of Torah. Religious Jewish Rationalists read Maimonides' Aristotelianism as a mutually-exclusive alternative metaphysics to [[Kabbalah]],&lt;ref&gt;Such as the first (religious) criticism of Kabbalah, ''Ari Nohem'', by [[Leon Modena]] from 1639. In it, Modena urges a return to Maimonidean Aristotelianism. ''The Scandal of Kabbalah: Leon Modena, Jewish Mysticism, Early Modern Venice'', Yaacob Dweck, Princeton University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as does the mainstream academic view on Maimonides. According to this, Medieval Jewish Rationalists and their [[Dor Daim|heirs]] today hold that only [[philosophy]] can extend the human capacity as much as possible to understand Divine secrets, rather than a revealed theosophy like Kabbalah. Some academics hold that Maimonides' project fought against the Proto-Kabbalah of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Menachem Kellner, ''Maimonides' Confrontation With Mysticism'', Littman Library, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Kabbalists and their heirs, however, read Maimonides according to Kabbalah or as an actual covert subscriber to Kabbalah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/107784/jewish/Philosopher-and-Mystic.htm Maimonides: Philosopher and Mystic] from ''Chabad.org''&lt;/ref&gt; According to this, he employed rationalism to defend Judaism rather than limit enquirey of ''Sod'' only to rationalism. His rationalism, if not taken as an opposition,&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary academic views in the study of Jewish mysticism, hold that 12-13th century Kabbalists wrote down and systemised their transmitted oral doctrines in oppositional response to Maimonidean rationalism. See e.g. Moshe Idel, ''Kabbalah: New Perspectives''&lt;/ref&gt; also assisted the Kabbalists, purifying their transmitted teaching from mistaken [[Anthropomorphism in Kabbalah|corporeal]] interpretations that could have been made from [[Heichalot|earlier Jewish mysticism]],&lt;ref&gt;The first comprehensive systemiser of Kabbalah, [[Moshe Cordovero]], for example, was influenced by Maimonides. One example is his instruction to undercut any conception of a Kabbalistic idea after grasping it in the mind. One's intellect runs to God in learning the idea, then returns back in qualified rejection of false spatial/temporal conceptions of the idea's truth, as the human mind can only think in material references. Cited in Louis Jacobs, ''The Jewish Religion: A Companion'', Oxford University Press, 1995, entry on Cordovero&lt;/ref&gt; though Kabbalists held that their theosophy alone allowed human access to Divine mysteries.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Lamm, ''The Religious Thought of Hasidism: Text and Commentary'', Ktav Pub, 1999: Introduction to chapter on Faith/Reason has historical overview of religious reasons for opposition to Jewish philosophy, including the Ontological reason, one Medieval Kabbalist holding that "we begin where they end"&lt;/ref&gt; In this passage, Maimonides mentions Divine secrets within Torah:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Adam and Eve were at first created as one being, having their backs united: they were then separated, and one half was removed and brought before Adam as Eve." Note how clearly it has been stated that Adam and Eve were two in some respects, and yet they remained one, according to the words, "Bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh" (Gen. ii. 23). The unity of the two is proved by the fact that both have the same name, for she is called ishah (woman), because she was taken out of ish (man), also by the words, "And shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh" (ii. 24). How great is the ignorance of those who do not see that all this necessarily includes some [other] idea [besides the literal meaning of the words].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', book 2 section 30&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Kabbalah:'''
{{quote|My beloved came down to His garden&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tikkun Chatzot]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;br /&gt;Kabbalah does not read Scripture as analogy, but as theosophical symbols of dynamic processes in the Supernal Divinity. According to this, Creation was ennacted through the letters of the [[Hebrew language]], particularly [[Names of God in Judaism|Divine Names]]. The [[Midrash]] describes God "looking into the Torah to Create the World", which Kabbalah extended into a linguistic mysticism. United with the [[Ein Sof|Infinite Divine]], the text of the Torah becomes one long Name of God, or alternatively, God's revealed Being as represented in this World. Kabbalists endeavoured to perceive the unlimited Divinity in the Torah of the [[Tree of life (biblical)|Tree of life]], through the exoteric Torah of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]], the two representing [[Divine transcendence|transcendent]] and [[Divine immanence|immanent]] revelations of God in the [[Sephirot]], uniting [[Tiferet]] ("The Holy One Blessed Be He") and [[Malkuth]] (Feminine [[Shekhinah]]).

The teachings of [[Isaac Luria]], which form the basis of modern esoteric [[Kabbalah]], read the mythological [[Lurianic Kabbalah|doctrine]] of ''[[Tohu and Tikun|Shevirat HaKeilim]]'' ("Shattering of the [[sephirot|vessels]] in God's Persona) from the account of the [[Edomite]] [[List of rulers of Edom|Kings]] of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 36:31 and I [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 1:43:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before there reigned any king over the children of Israel..."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In Kabbalah, based on exoteric [[Midrash]], the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Hebrew Patriarchs]]: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, embody the sephirot of ''Chesed-Kindness'', ''Gevurah-Strength'' and ''Tiferet-Beauty''. Kindness and Judgement are polar forces and Beauty harmonises. The imbalances emerged in [[Ishmael]] and [[Esau]], while the harmony fathered the [[12 tribes of Israel]]. Ishmael and Esau are considered the spiritual roots of the Nations, deriving from the initial unrectified spiritual Realm of [[Tohu and Tikun|Tohu]]-Chaos, whose pristine Divine potential was too high to be contained in Existence, shattering its vessels which fell down into exile. The Israelites relate to the lower Realm of [[Tohu and Tikun|Tikun]]-Rectification. The [[Jewish Messianism|Messianic Era]] for all people will embody both advantages of the high lights of Tohu in the rectified vessels of Tikun, when "all Nations will ascend the mountain of God".&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 2:3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edom]], the progeny of Esau, corresponds to unrectified [[Gevurah]]-Strength, the waste of which vitalises the [[kelipot]] shells. Gevurah is the [[Tzimtzum|constricting]] force in Creation, allowing independent Existence, but also causing the initial vessels of Tohu to act independently and shatter. The Edomite Kings who reigned before any king in Israel, while also being historical people according to ''Peshat'', in Kabbalah both embody and symbolise the vessels of Tohu that shattered. The verses name eight kings, the breakages in the eight emotional sephirot from Daat to Malchut. Death is the lights-souls reascending and the vessel fragments falling, animated by remnant sparks of light. Of the eighth king, only Genesis says he died, as Malchut remained partially intact. The sparks of holiness animate Creation down to Material Existence. In the highest [[Four Worlds|World]] [[Atziluth]], the general root-sparks number 288, read out by [[gematria]] from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:2–3:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And the Earth was [[Tohu wa-bohu|chaos and void]] (the World of [[Tohu and Tikun|Tohu]]), with darkness upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God hovered (מרחפת-"''Merachepet''", the sparks animating the fragments [[Ohr|externally]]) over the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light..(the World of [[Tohu and Tikun|Tikun]], allowing stable reception of Divine revelation)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"''Merachepet''" divides into 288 (רפח) sparks animating within the מת-"dead"-fallen fragments.

==Pardes exegesis and essence==
In a discourse [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], the Lubavitch Rebbe, asks where [[Hasidic thought]] fits in with Pardes exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Essence of Chasidus: A Chasidic Discourse by Rabbi Menachem M Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe'', Kehot publications, reissued 2003. This is a bi-lingual translation of the original Hebrew [[Maamarim (Chabad)|Maamar]] ''Inyana Shel Toras HaHasidus-The Concept of the Torah of Hasidism'', originally delivered orally in 1965, then edited by the Rebbe with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; [[Habad]] is the intellectualist school in [[Hasidic Judaism]], translating the mystical faith of General-Hasidism and the movement's [[Baal Shem Tov|founder]] into intellectual articulation. The works of the last Habad leader focus on uniting the different aspects of traditional Jewish thought, exoteric and esoteric, through the Hasidic explanation. The four levels of Pardes in [[Kabbalah]] articulate the [[Four Worlds|Four spiritual Worlds]] and the four [[Kochos hanefesh|soul levels]] in Action, Emotion, Understanding and Wisdom. In the discourse he describes General-Hasidism relating through faith to the [[Atzmus|essence]] of the soul, the Torah, and God (Hasidic focus on Divine [[Panentheism|Omnipresence]] perceived by the soul's essence). In esoteric Kabbalistic terminology this relates to the fifth (highest) primary World of [[Adam Kadmon]], and the above-conscious fifth (highest) soul level of Will (internal aspect: soul-root "Delight"), called in Kabbalah "Yehida-Unity". He describes Habad thought articulating in intellectual grasp the essence-fifth level of Torah exegesis, ''Hasidut-Yehida'' not listed above the four levels of PaRDeS because as essence it is not limited to a particular form. ''Peshat'', ''Remez'', ''Drush'' and ''Sod'' are constrained by their limited disciplines: from ''Peshat'' describing material perception to ''Sod-Kabbalah'' limited to the esoteric supernal emanations of God. As essence, Hasidic thought, investigated intellectually in Habad, both transcends all four levels of Pardes in its own exegetical explanation, and permeates within the four. ''Yechida-Essence'' is revealed through the four levels of Pardes, but not constrained by them. The particular exegeses of PaRDeS become connected together in light of the Hasidic exegesis. In this way, the discourse describes Kabbalah, which gains psychological understanding through Hasidism, being actually a limited esoteric commentary on Hasidism's ''Yehida-Essence''. Kabbalah remains transcendent, while Hasidic thought emphasises action, as the [[Atzmut]] essence of God receives its only true revelation in the ultimate Material purpose to Creation, the Omnipresent Divinity related to in Hasidic thought.

==Association with paradise==
{{Main|Pardes (legend)}}
The Pardes system is often regarded as mystically linked to the word ''pardes'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] פָּרְדֵּס), meaning [[orchard]]. "Pardes" is etymologically related to the English word "[[paradise]]", and the [[Quran]]ic Firdaus ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] فِردَوس) among various other forms, in that they all share a common origin in an [[Old Iranian]] root, attested in the [[Avestan language]] as ''pairi.daêza-''.&lt;ref name="New Oxford"&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs only three times in the [[Tanakh]], namely, in [[Song of Songs]] 4:13, [[Ecclesiastes]] 2:5, and [[Nehemiah]] 2:8. In the first of these passages it means "garden"; in the second and third, "park." In the apocalypses and in the [[Talmud]] the word is used of the [[Garden of Eden]] and its heavenly prototype.&lt;ref&gt;Compare references in Weber's ''Jüdische Theologie'', 2d ed., 1897, pp. 344 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; From this usage, comes [[Christianity]]'s denotation of Paradise as the [[Heaven|abode of the blessed]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 23:43; [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians|II Cor]]. 12:4; [[Book of Revelation|Rev]] 2:7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=65&amp;letter=P Paradise] in the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pardes and modern exegesis==
The Pardes exegesis system flows from traditional belief in the text as Divine revelation; [[Mosaic authorship]] in regard to the [[Torah]], prophetic inspirations in the rest of [[Tanakh]], and belief in [[Oral Torah]] transmission. Modern [[Jewish denominations]] differ over the validity of applying modern historical-critical exegetical methods to Scripture. [[Haredi]] Judaism regards the Oral Torah texts as revelation, and can apply Pardes method to read classic [[Rabbinic literature]]. [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] is open to historical critical study of Rabbinic literature and some application to the later Biblical canon. Additionally, some Modern Orthodox scholars have looked at [[Biblical Criticism]] on the Torah, incorporating some of its views within traditional belief in Mosaic revelation.&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations'' (The Orthodox Forum Series), Shalom Carmy editor, Jason Aronson publishers, 1996. Also Rabbi Dr. Nathan Lopes Cardozo study: [http://www.aishdas.org/toratemet/en_cardozo.html On Bible Criticism and Its Counterarguments] 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Orthodox denominations apply critical method throughout, but with different theological conclusions.

Beginning with [[Samuel David Luzzatto]] in the nineteenth century, there has been an approach to understanding the Torah that finds statements in classical [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]] that would allow acceptance of revelation, and still use [[Lower Criticism]].&lt;ref name=Heschel&gt;[http://www.yctorah.org/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_view/gid,312/ Aggadic Man: The Poetry and Rabbinic Thought of Abraham Joshua Heschel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023856/http://www.yctorah.org/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_view/gid,312 |date=2016-03-04 }}, Alan Brill, ''Meorot'' Journal - ''A Forum of Modern Orthodox Discourse'' 6:1, 2006. Pages 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; Comments of Rashbam, Ibn Ezra, Ibn Caspi, Judah Ha-Hasid, and Abravenel have been used in this historical-philological form of ''Peshat''.&lt;ref name=Heschel/&gt;

In the 20th Century, the [[Conservative Judaism]] philosopher-theologian [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], while accepting modern scholarship, saw existentialist revelation and Divine encounter as the foundation of legitimate Bible interpretation. His 1962 masterwork, ''Torah min HaShamayim BeAspaklariya shel HaDorot'' (English: ''Torah from Heaven in the Light of the Generations'') is a study of classical rabbinic theology and [[aggadah]] (spiritual thought), as opposed to [[halakha]] (Jewish law) in revealing the Divinity of [[Torah study]]. It explores the views of the Rabbis in the Talmud, Midrash and among the philosophical and mystical traditions, about the nature of Torah, the revelation of God to mankind, prophecy, and the ways that Jews have used scriptural exegesis to expand and understand these core Jewish texts in a living, fluid spiritual exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;An English translation by Gordon Tucker is titled ''Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons with other traditions==
The Pardes typology has some similarities to the contemporary Christian [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|fourfold allegorical scheme]]. The great Muslim scholar and Imam, [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the last Caliph before the schism of Sunni and Shia expresses in similar fashion that the Quran has four levels of interpretation similar to that of the PaRDeS: “The Book of God has four things: literal expression (‘ibāra), allusion (ishāra), subtleties (laṭā’if), and deepest realities (ḥaqā’iq). The literal expression is for the common folk (‘awāmm), the allusion is for the elite (khawāṣṣ), the subtleties are for the friends of God (awliyā’), and the deepest realities are for the prophets (anbiyā’)." &lt;ref&gt;From ''Spiritual Gems: The Mystical Qur’an Commentary'' ascribed to Ja’far al-Sadiq as contained in Sulami’s ''Haqa’iq al-Tafsir'' (Louisville: Fons Vitae, 2011), trans. Farhana Mayer, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre-André Taguieff''' (born 4 August 1946) is a philosopher and director of research at the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] in an ''[[Paris Institute of Political Studies|Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris]]'' laboratory, the CEVIPOF. He is also a member of the ''[[Cercle de l'Oratoire]]'' think tank.&lt;ref&gt;Lancelin, Aude. [http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4315731/Does-progress-have-a-future.html Does progress have a future? A conversation with Pierre-Andre Taguieff"], ''Queen's Quarterly'', December 22, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taguieff is the author of a number of books and papers on racism and antisemitism, including ''The Force of Prejudice: On Racism and Its Doubles'' (2001) and ''Rising from the Muck: The New Antisemitism in Europe'' (2004). He is known in particular for his studies on the French [[Front national (France)|National Front]] and [[populism]].&lt;ref&gt;Vinocur, John. [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/20/news/20iht-chirac_ed3_.html "Chirac's anti-Semitism fight"], ''The New York Times'', November 20, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs and works ==

=== On racism ===
In ''La Force du préjugé – essai sur le racisme et ses doubles'' (1987), Taguieff analyzed several different types of racism:
* The first type of racism is against [[miscegenation]], in favor of [[racial segregation]], and wants to preserve differences between various alleged [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]]. 19th century [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racialism]] theories, such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–55), are an example of this type of racism, which [[scientific racism|pretends to be founded on science]] and on the existence of biological human races. In other words, this pseudo-scientific racism mistakes differences in the amount of [[melanin]] (which determines [[skin color]]) for racial differences.
* The second type is insidiously hosted by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophy of [[universalism]]: its dream of unity of mankind may bring it, in specific and extreme cases, to the will to annihilate all cultural differences, amounting to effective [[genocide]] or [[ethnocide]]s. Taguieff's point is not in declaring that the Enlightenment philosophy is racist in itself, but extreme forms of this will of universality may lead, in practice, to the destruction of the plurality of cultures and to the rejection of even moderate forms of [[multiculturalism]].
* The third and more recent type has integrated the [[cultural relativism|cultural relativists]]' attacks against racism. This new form of racism has reversed the famous anti-racist arguments of [[ethnology|ethnologist]] [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]. According to Lévi-Strauss, different cultures are incommensurable, and, because of this, each one thinks progress and superiority is on its side - Lévi-Strauss, in his 1952 essay for the [[UNESCO]], used the famous metaphor of two trains crossing each other's path: each one thinks he is going the right way, while the other seems not to move or to move backward. Because of this, [[ethnocentrism]] is a necessary optical illusion, which in turn racist [[discourse]] uses to justify itself.

Taguieff was himself accused of racism on several occasions, for instance when he praised [[Oriana Fallaci]]'s book ''[[The Rage and the Pride]]'', a book that some anti-racist militants consider to be racist.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume de Rouville, [http://www.afrique-asie.fr/menu/afrique/3773-l-esprit-du-temps-ou-l-islamophobie-radicale.html L’esprit du temps ou l’islamophobie radicale], 16 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lmsi.net/Chronique-du-racisme-republicain,632 Chronique du racisme républicain], ''Les mots sont importants'', 26 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also criticized for his contribution to the controversial website ''Dreuz info'', which French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' described as ultra zionist and islamophobic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2011/07/26/oslo-la-fachosphere-francaise-entre-colere-et-fascination_1552852_823448.html Attentats en Norvège : la "fachosphère" française entre colère et fascination], ''Le Monde'', 26 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On the Nouvelle Droite's discourse ===
According to Taguieff, racist discourse, such as that supported by [[Alain de Benoist]]'s ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' [[far-right]] movement, has accepted the theories of cultural relativism and the non-existence of biological race. Claiming to uphold cultural relativism and thus antiracism, this new racist discourse in fact reiterates the strict distinction of various [[ethnic groups]] and segregation between them.

Since it argues that "ethnic groups" exist but are not biological races, it claims not to be racist. However, apart from the [[pseudo-science|pseudo-scientific racist theories]] of the 19th century, it espouses an anti-[[assimilationist]] point of view in completely rejecting the notion of a social [[melting pot]]. Arguing that the Enlightenment's philosophy of universality, taken to extremes, is a form of racism, it pretends to be antiracist by preaching strict separation of ethnic groups. However, if the critics of "universal racism" are correct, it is clear that this new form of racism is descended in a direct line from the old discourse of separation between different supposed races.

=== About anti-Semitism and ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' ===
Taguieff is also very interested in the work of [[Leon Poliakov]] and [[Norman Cohn]] and has worked a great deal on the antisemitic forgery ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. Today he works on [[nationalism]], the future of the [[Republic]], and the concept of [[progress (history)|progress]].

Pierre-André Taguieff's denunciation of [[antisemitism]] and of the instrumentalisation of [[anti-Zionism]] by specific ultra-minority groups has caused controversy, his opponents claiming that he was identifying anti-Zionism with antisemitism. However, Pierre-André Taguieff is a staunch opponent of any form of [[communitarianism]] whatsoever. As such, he does not claim that anti-Zionism is necessarily antisemitism, but simply that in some [[Islamist]] circles, explicit anti-Zionism may dissimulate implicit antisemitism, in the pure tradition of the European history of antisemitism.

Despite its contrast to conservatism (he is a former [[Situationist International|situationist]] close to [[René Viénet]]), Pierre-André Taguieff wrote ''Les Contre-réactionnaires'' (Denoël, 2007) in which he opposed both [[antiracism]] and [[antifascism]]. He considers them as ideologies which are instrumentalized by [[far-left]] groups (p.&amp;nbsp;576) « aiming to regularize as many illegal immigrants as possible without any regulation » (p.&amp;nbsp;574).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Les contre-réactionnaires: Le progressisme entre illusion et imposture|url = https://www.amazon.fr/Les-contre-r%25C3%25A9actionnaires-progressisme-illusion-imposture/dp/220725321X|publisher = Denoël|date = 2007-03-15|location = Paris|isbn = 9782207253212|first = Pierre-André|last = Taguieff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Platonism}}
'''Plato's tripartite theory of soul''' is a theory of [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] proposed by the ancient Greek [[philosopher]] [[Plato]] in his treatise the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', and also with the [[chariot allegory]] in ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]''. In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', [[Plato]] asserted that the [[Wiktionary:ψυχή|ψυχή]] (''psyche'') is composed of three parts; the [[Wiktionary:λογιστικός|λογιστικόν]] (''logistykon'', logical), the θυμοειδές (''thymoeides'', spirited) and the ἐπιθυμητικόν (''epithymetikon'', appetitive).  These three parts of the ψυχή also correspond to the three classes of a society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-ethics-politics/ "Plato's Ethics and Politics in The Republic" at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] – Retrieved August 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether in a city or an individual, [[Wiktionary:δικαιοσύνη|δικαιοσύνη]] (''dikaiosyne'', justice) is declared to be the state of the whole in which each part fulfills its function without attempting to interfere in the functions of others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Rep.+4.433a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0167 Plato Republic IV (433a)]&lt;/ref&gt; The function of the ἐπιθυμητικόν is to produce and seek pleasure. The function of the λογιστικός is to gently rule through the love of learning. The function of the θυμοειδές is to obey the directions of the λογιστικός while ferociously defending the whole from external invasion and internal disorder. Whether in a city or an individual, [[Wiktionary:ἀδικία|ἀδικία]] (''adikia'', injustice) is the contrary state of the whole, often taking the specific form in which the spirited listens instead to the appetitive, while they together either ignore the logical entirely or employ it in their pursuits of pleasure.

==In the Republic==
In Book IV of the ''Republic'', [[Socrates]] and his interlocutors (Glaucon and Adeimantus) are attempting to answer whether the soul is one or made of parts. Socrates states that, "It is clear that the same thing will never do or undergo opposite things in the same part of it and towards the same thing at the same time; so if we find this happening, we shall know it was not one thing but more than one."&lt;ref&gt;Republic IV: 436 b6–C1 ([[W. H. D. Rouse]] translation)&lt;/ref&gt; (This is an example of Plato's [[Principle of Non-Contradiction]].) For instance, it seems that, given each person has only one soul, it should be impossible for a person to simultaneously desire something yet also at that very moment be averse to the same thing, as when one is tempted to commit a crime but also averse to it.  Both Socrates and [[Glaucon]] agree that it should not be possible for the soul to at the same time both be in one state and its opposite. From this it follows that there must be at least two aspects to soul.&lt;ref name="ATOSSEP"&gt;''[https://philpapers.org/rec/CALPPO-2 Plato’s Psychology of Action and the Origin of Agency];'' [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ancient-soul/#3.2 "Ancient Theories of Soul" at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Reason (λογιστικόν)==
The logical or ''logistikon'' (from ''[[logos]]'') is the thinking part of the soul which loves the truth and seeks to learn it. Plato originally identifies the soul dominated by this part with the Athenian temperament.&lt;ref&gt;Republic IV 435 e8–9&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ''logistikon'' discerns what is the real and not merely apparent, judges what is true and what is false and wisely makes just decisions in accordance with its love for goodness.

Plato makes the point that the ''logistikon'' would be the smallest part of the soul (as the rulers would be the smallest population within the Republic), but that, nevertheless, a soul can be declared just only if all three parts agree that the ''logistikon'' should rule.&lt;ref&gt;Republic IV 442 a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spirit (θυμοειδές)==
According to Plato, the spirited or ''thymoeides'' (from ''[[thumos|thymos]]'') is the part of the soul by which we are angry or get into a temper.&lt;ref&gt;Republic IV 439 e3–4&lt;/ref&gt; He also calls this part 'high spirit' and initially identifies the soul dominated by this part with the [[Thracians]], [[Scythians]] and the people of 'northern regions.'&lt;ref&gt;Republic IV 435 e4–8&lt;/ref&gt; In the just soul, the spirited aligns with the ''logistikon'' and resists the desires of the appetitive, becoming manifested as 'indignation' and in general the courage to be good. In the unjust soul, the spirited ignores the ''logistikon'' and aligns with the desires of the appetitive, manifesting as the demand for the pleasures of the body.

==Appetite (ἐπιθυμητικόν)==
The appetite or ''epithymetikon'' (from ''[[Wikt:ἐπιθυμία|epithymia]]'', translated to Latin as ''[[Concupiscence|concupiscentiae]]'' or ''desideria'')&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, T. 2003. ''From Passions to Emotions: The Creation of a Secular Psychological Category''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 39. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B9c8tNQVI4YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false link].&lt;/ref&gt; is the part of the soul by which we experience carnal erotic love, hunger, thirst and in general the desires opposed to the ''logistikon''.&lt;ref&gt;Republic 439 d5–7&lt;/ref&gt; (The appetitive is in fact labelled as being 'a-logical'.&lt;ref&gt;Republic 439 d7&lt;/ref&gt;)

Plato also identifies this part of the soul with the pleasure involved in human reproduction. He further relates this part to the love of money-making, which he mentions as being the particular mark of the [[Phoenicians]] and [[Egyptians]].&lt;ref&gt;Republic 436 a1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7163">A '''status paradox''' can be one of several paradoxes involving "status", in the meaning of either [[medical state]] or [[social status]].

== Status paradox of migration ==

This type of status paradox describes how a migration of peoples can alter the status of these peoples, either higher or lower. It is related to [[economic inequality]] between world regions which creates incentives for [[Mixtec transnational migration|transnational migrants]] to transfer resources earned in richer countries to poorer countries and, thereby, to gain buying power and social status. 

An example is a migration of laboring migrants from poorer countries, such as [[Mexico]], [[Albania]] or [[Ghana]]. Their ability to work is considered qualified by the standards of their home country, but is much diminished in the new country they come to. This causes their social status to drop in their new country of living, while their level of education or training held them in a higher social circle in their country of origin. This type of status inconsistency creates the paradox of the migrants being qualified for two different social classes at the same time, but they can only use each class if they are within the boundaries of where it is relevant. Because of global inequalities in terms of wealth and buying power transnational migrants to which the status paradox applies challenge local [[Middle class|middle classes]] in the sending countries. In several countries of the global south names have emerged to classify these migrants, such as Burgers (Ghana), Bengiste (Côte d'Ivoire) or Modou Modou (Senegal).&lt;ref&gt;Nieswand, Boris (2011) Theorising Transnational Migration. The Status Paradox of Migration. London: Routledege. {{ISBN|978-0-415-58455-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wealth and HIV status paradox ==

For higher classes with greater amount of wealth, it is naturally assumed that they will have less of a chance of acquiring infectious diseases because they have the money to stop the spread of such diseases. Meanwhile, lower classes with less wealth will not be able to afford treatments to stop the spread of diseases and might even not be knowledgeable about dangerous diseases that they might be catching, so they are at a higher likelihood of catching and spreading various diseases.&lt;ref name="HIV" /&gt;

However, this is not the case in [[Africa]] with [[HIV]]. The upper class, instead, are the ones that have the highest percentage of HIV infection, specifically 15- to 29-year-olds. This creates a type of status paradox, having a "disease of affluence", associated with differing class levels.&lt;ref name="HIV" /&gt;

== Gender and status paradox ==
Gender, within the realm of economics and business, has long been a dividing factor in terms of [[income gender gap|wages]] and management. The use of humor by women in management is one method of relieving the tension created from women being in charge over men, which is seen as a status paradox.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Applied Communication Research, Vol. 32, No. 2, May 2004, pp. 147–170, [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:AcEXOHuumnEJ:www.sjsu.edu/upload/course/course_5376/Martin.pdf+%22status+paradox%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;sig=AHIEtbTo-cErUEe1Vfy39HAHcM-4LZUhUg "Humor in Middle Management: Women Negotiating the Paradoxes of Organizational Life" - Google Docs] [http://www.sjsu.edu/upload/course/course_5376/Martin.pdf alternative source] at [[San José State University|SJSU]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lifestyle-health status paradox ==

For people in the United States, [[obesity]] has been a growing trend. The formation of a healthy lifestyle is a viewpoint that is generally not attributed to Americans. From such increases in weight, [[diabetes]], [[asthma]], and [[migraines]] have grown more common. However, offsetting this somewhat, the number of people contracting cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases has been dropping for the age range of Americans that are at a higher likelihood of being obese. This status paradox does not correlate with the evidence that shows such rates should be increasing, not decreasing.&lt;ref name="Health" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1188">'''The swamping problem''' is a problem that appears in the context of [[epistemology]] that shows that the idea that knowledge has no additional value over true belief. The problem assumes that knowledge is a [[true justified belief]]—the canonical definition—and proceeds to show that knowledge has no more value over true belief by showing that the justification requirement does not add value to the definition. The first known historical mentioning of the problem is in [[Plato]]'s [[Meno]], when Meno and Socrates have a discussion on how they should choose their guide to [[Larissa]]. Meno suggests that they need someone who knows the route, but Socrates suggests that someone with true opinion will do as well.

'''Tang Yongtong''' ({{zh|s=|t=湯用彤|p=Tāng Yòngtóng}}; 4 August 1893&amp;ndash;1 May 1964) was a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] educator, philosopher and scholar best known for studying [[Chinese Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="sutras"&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2008-04-07/115615305066.shtml |script-title=zh:北大历任校长：汤用彤(1949.5-1951)|trans-title=President of Peking University: Tang Yongtong |newspaper=sina |date=2008-04-17 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.sohu.com/a/168860879_99930289 |title=Tong Yongtong|newspaper=Sohu |date=2017-09-01 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tang was proficient in [[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]], English and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://fo.ifeng.com/a/20170721/44653892_0.shtml?_share=sina&amp;tp=1500566400000 |script-title=zh:农历六月廿八 著名佛学家汤用彤诞辰纪念日 |newspaper=ifeng |date=2017-07-21 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tang attended the [[Tsinghua University|Tsinghua School]] and [[Beijing No. 4 High School|Shuntian School]] before he pursued advanced studies in the [[United States]]. While studying at [[Harvard University]], he became known as "one of the three Outstanding Persons of Harvard" along with [[Chen Yinke]] and [[Wu Mi]].

He was an academician of the [[Academia Sinica]]. He was a member of the 1st National Committee of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]]. He was also a delegate to the [[1st National People's Congress|1st]], [[2nd National People's Congress|2nd]] and [[3rd National People's Congress]]. 

==Biography==
[[File:Babaoshan graves 2012 01.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Tang Yongtong in [[Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery|Babaoshan]], [[Beijing]].]]
Tang was born in [[Weiyuan County, Gansu|Weiyuan County]], [[Gansu]] on August 4, 1893, while his [[Ancestral home (Chinese)|ancestral home]] in [[Huangmei County]], [[Hubei]]. His father Tang Lin ({{zh|t=湯霖|labels=no}}) was a scholar in the late [[Qing dynasty]]. In 1908 he attended the [[Beijing No. 4 High School|Shuntian School]]. In 1911, he enrolled at the [[Tsinghua University|Tsinghua School]], where he graduated in 1916. Tang arrived in the [[United States]] in 1918 at the age of 25 to begin his education at [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="sutras"/&gt; 

He returned to China after graduation in 1922 and that same year became professor of National Southeast University. After a short period of teaching students in [[Nankai University]], he returned to [[Nanjing]], where he was a professor at [[National Central University]]. In 1931, he moved to [[Peking University]] as a professor at the Department of Philosophy, where he was promoted to dean of College of Liberal Arts in 1946. In the following 1947 he went to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he lectured the [[History of Chinese Buddhism]]. In 1948 he was elected a fellow of the [[Academia Sinica]]. In December 1948 he refused to go to [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], while [[Chiang Kai-shek]] invited him to follow the Nationalists. In January 1949 he was proposed as the new chairman of Peking University.&lt;ref name="sutras"/&gt; 

In 1949, the year of the defeat of the Communists over the Nationalists in the [[Chinese Civil War]], Tang stayed on Peking University in [[Beijing]]. He was appointed vice-president of Peking University in 1951. Two years later, he was elected a member of the newly established [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]. In 1954, he was diagnosed with [[intracerebral hemorrhage]] and then stayed in bed for a long time. Tang died in Beijing on May 1, 1964.

==Personal life==
Tang married Zhang Jingping ({{zh|t=張敬平|labels=no}}). The couple had two sons and two daughters, in order of birth: Tang Yimei ({{zh|t=湯一梅|labels=no}}; died young), Tang Yijie ({{zh|t=湯一介|labels=no}}), Tang Yixuan ({{zh|t=湯一玄|labels=no}}) and Tang Yiping ({{zh|t=湯一平|labels=no}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.tjculture.com/read.php?id=252482 |script-title=zh:老照片：汤用彤、汤一介父子两位国学大师和南开的情缘(组图) |newspaper= tjculture.com|date=2015 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.chinanews.com/cul/2014/09-11/6580414.shtml |script-title=zh:汤一介出身学术世家 父亲汤用彤是国学大师|newspaper=chinanews.com |date=2014-09-11 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their elder son, [[Tang Yijie]] (1927&amp;ndash;2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url= |script-title=zh: |newspaper= |date= |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Peking University professor, who had been described as China's top scholar on philosophy and Chinese studies.&lt;ref name=scmp&gt;{{cite news |last1=Luo|first1=Chris |title=China's top philosophy scholar and 'Sinology master' Tang Yijie dies at 87 |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1589251/renowned-chinese-philosophy-scholar-died-beijing |newspaper=South China Morning Post |date=2014-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3472">In [[propositional logic]], '''tautological consequence''' is a strict form of [[logical consequence]]&lt;ref&gt;Barwise and Etchemendy 1999, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[Tautology (logic)|tautologousness]] of a [[proposition]] is preserved from one line of a proof to the next. Not all logical consequences are tautological consequences. A [[proposition]] &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a tautological consequence of one or more other propositions (&lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt;) in a [[formal proof|proof]] with respect to some [[logical system]] if one is [[Validity (logic)|validly]] able to introduce the proposition onto a line of the proof within the [[Rule of inference|rules]] of the system and in all cases when each of those one or more other propositions (&lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt;) are true, the proposition &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; also is true.

Another way to express this preservation of tautologousness is by using [[truth table]]s. A proposition &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a tautological consequence of one or more other propositions (&lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt;) if and only if in every row of a joint truth table that assigns "T" to all propositions (&lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt;) the truth table also assigns "T" to &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.


==Example==
{{mvar|a}} = "Socrates is a man."
{{mvar|b}} = "All men are mortal."
{{mvar|c}} = "Socrates is mortal."

:{{mvar|a}}
:{{mvar|b}}
:&lt;math&gt;{\therefore c}&lt;/math&gt;

The conclusion of this argument is a logical consequence of the premises because it is impossible for all the premises to be true while the conclusion false.

{| border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;" class="wikitable"

|-
| F  || F  || T  || F  || T
|-
| F  || F  || F  || F  || F
|}

Reviewing the truth table, it turns out the conclusion of the argument is ''not'' a tautological consequence of the premise. Not every row that assigns T to the premise also assigns T to the conclusion. In particular, it is the second row that assigns T to ''a'' ∧ ''b'', but does not assign T to ''c''.

==Denotation and properties==
It follows from the definition that if a proposition ''p'' is a contradiction then ''p'' tautologically implies every proposition, because there is no truth valuation that causes ''p'' to be true and so the definition of tautological implication is trivially satisfied. Similarly, if ''p'' is a tautology then ''p'' is tautologically implied by every proposition.

[[File:Thomas Cajetan Kupferstich.jpg|thumb|Giacomo de Vito Caetano, Fra Tommaso]]
'''Thomas Cajetan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|dʒ|ə|t|ən}}; 20 February 1469 – 9 August 1534), also known as '''Gaetanus''',  commonly '''Tommaso de Vio '''or '''Thomas de Vio''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] philosopher, theologian, [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] (from 1517 until his death) and the [[Master of the Order of Preachers]] 1508-18.  He was a leading theologian of his day who is now best known as the spokesman for Catholic opposition to the teachings of [[Martin Luther]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]] while he was the Pope's [[Papal legate|Legate]] in [[Augsburg]], and perhaps also among Catholics for his extensive commentary on the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03145c.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Tommaso de Vio Gaetani Cajetan |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1908-11-01 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is not to be confused with his contemporary, [[Saint Cajetan]], the founder of the Theatines.

==Life==
De Vio was born in [[Gaeta]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], as '''Jacopo Vio'''. The name Tommaso was taken as a [[monastery|monastic]] name, while the surname Cajetan derives from his native city.  At the age of fifteen he entered the [[Dominican order]], and devoted himself to his       study of [[Thomism|philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] when he became, before the age of thirty, a doctor of [[theology]] at [[university of Padua|Padua]], where he was subsequently professor of [[metaphysics]].

A public disputation at [[Ferrara]] (1494) with [[Pico della Mirandola]] gave him a great reputation as a [[theology|theologian]]. He was made general procurator in 1507 and [[General superior|general]] of his order a year later in 1508. For his zeal in defending the [[papal]] rights against the 1511 Council of Pisa, in a series of works which were condemned by the [[Collège de Sorbonne|Sorbonne]] and publicly burnt by order of [[Louis XII of France|King Louis&amp;nbsp;XII]], he obtained the [[bishopric of Gaeta]], and in 1517 [[Pope Leo X|Pope Leo&amp;nbsp;X]] made him a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] and [[archbishop of Palermo]].

He appears in 1511 as a supporter of the pope against the claims of the [[Conciliabulum of Pisa|Council of Pisa]] (1511-1512), called by dissident cardinals to punish Pope [[Julius II]], who had ignored the electoral capitulations he had accepted before being elected.  Cajetan composed in defense of his position the ''Tractatus de Comparatione auctoritatis Papæ et conciliorum ad invicem''. [[Jacques Almain]] answered this work, and Cajetan replied in his ''Apologia''.  Cajetan refused to accept Almain's argument that the Church's polity had to be similar to a lay regime, complete with limits on the ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. Izbicki, "Cajetan's Attack on Parallel's Between Church and State," ''Cristianesimo nella storia'' 29 (1999): 81-89.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Fifth Lateran Council]] (1512–17) which Pope [[Julius II]] set up in opposition to that of Pisa, De Vio played the leading role. During the second session of the council, in which he gave the opening oration, he brought about a decree recognizing the superiority of papal authority to that of councils.

In 1517, [[Leo X]] made him [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal presbyter]] of [[San Sisto Vecchio|San Sisto]] in [[Rome]] for his services. In the following year, he became [[Diocese of Palermo|bishop of Palermo]]. He resigned as bishop of Palermo in 1519 to become [[bishop of Gaeta]], as granted him by the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], for whose election De Vio had labored zealously. 
[[File:Luther-vor-Cajetan.jpg|thumb|The meeting of Cajetan (left) and [[Martin Luther]] (right).]]

In 1518 he was sent as legate to the [[Diet of Augsburg]] and to him, at the wish of the [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Saxon elector]], was entrusted the task of examining and testing the teachings of [[Martin Luther|Luther]].  According to Catholic polemicist [[Hilaire Belloc]], "[Luther] had not been treated roughly by his opponents, the roughness had been on his side.  But things had gone against him, and he had been made to look foolish; he had been cross-examined into denying, for instance, the authority of a General Council--which authority was the trump card to play against the Papacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1519, De Vio helped in drawing up the bill of excommunication against Luther.

De Vio was employed in several other negotiations and transactions, being as able in business as in letters. In conjunction with Cardinal Giulio de'&amp;nbsp;Medici in the [[Papal conclave, 1521–22|conclave of 1521‑1522]], he secured the election of Adrian Boeyens, [[bishop of Tortosa]], as [[pope Adrian VI|Adrian&amp;nbsp;VI]]. He retained influence under [[Clement VII]], suffered a short term of imprisonment after the storming of Rome by the [[Charles III, Duke of Bourbon|Constable of Bourbon]] and by [[Georg von Frundsberg|Frundsberg]] (1527), retired to his bishopric for a few years, and, returning to Rome in 1530, assumed his old position of influence about the person of Clement, in whose behalf he wrote the decision rejecting the appeal for divorce from [[Catharine of Aragon]] made by [[Henry VIII of England]]. Nominated by [[pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] a member of the committee of cardinals appointed to report on the "Nuremberg Recess", he recommended, in opposition to the majority, certain concessions to the Lutherans, notably the marriage of the clergy as in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Church]], and communion in both kinds according to the decision of the council of Basel.

Cardinal De Vio died in [[Rome]] in 1534.

==Views==
[[File:De Vio - Opuscula omnia, 1596 - 4592647 BEIC3 V00110 F0009.tif|thumb|''Opuscula omnia'', 1596]]
As a philosopher and logician, Cajetan defended the idea of [[analogy]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua P. Hochschild, ''The semantics of analogy: rereading Cajetan's De nominum analogia'' (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Though as a theologian De Vio was a scholastic of the older [[Thomism|Thomist]] type, his general position was that of the moderate reformers of the school to which [[Reginald Pole]], later [[archbishop of Canterbury]], also belonged; i.e.,&amp;nbsp;he desired to retain the best elements of the humanist revival in harmony with [[Catholic]] orthodoxy illumined by a revived appreciation of the Augustinian doctrine of justification. In the field of [[Thomism|Thomistic]] philosophy, he showed striking independence of judgment, expressing liberal views on marriage and divorce, denying the existence of a material [[Hell]] and advocating the celebration of public prayers in the vernacular.

Some Dominicans regarded his views as too independent of those of Saint Thomas.   The [[Collège de Sorbonne|Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]] found some of these views heterodox, and in the 1570 edition of his celebrated commentary on [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]' ''Summa'', the objectionable passages were expunged. In this spirit he wrote commentaries upon portions of [[Aristotle]], and upon the ''Summa'' of [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]], and towards the end of his life, made a careful translation of the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New]] Testaments, excepting [[Song of Solomon|Solomon's Song]], the [[Prophet]]s and the [[Book of Revelation|Revelation of St John]]. Cajetan also wrote opinions on subjects of practical importance, such as the disposition of plundered goods the ownership of which could not be determined.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. Izbicki, “Cajetan on the Acquisition of Stolen Goods in the Old and New Worlds,” ''Rivista di Storia del Cristianesimo'' 4 (2007): 499-509.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] he remained a steadfast opponent, composing several works directed against [[Martin Luther]],&lt;ref&gt;''Cajetan Responds A Reader in Reformation Controversy'', ed. Jared Wicks (Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; and taking an important share in shaping the policy of the papal delegates in Germany. Learned though he was in the [[scholastic theology|scholastics]], he recognized that to fight the Reformers with some chance of success a deeper knowledge of the Scriptures than he possessed was necessary. To this study, he devoted himself with characteristic zeal, wrote commentaries on the greater part of the Old and the New Testament, and, in the exposition of his text, which he treated critically, allowed himself considerable latitude in departing from the literal and traditional interpretation.

De Vio is reported as declaring {{Where?|date=March 2017}}
{{quote|Now what a ruler can do in virtue of his office, so that justice may be served in the manner of riches, is to take from someone who is unwilling to dispense from what is superfluous for life or state, and to distribute it to the poor... as Basil said, it belongs to the indigent"}}
a statement that has seemed controversial to some. {{Who?|date=March 2017}}

In contrast to the majority of Italian cardinals of his day, De Vio was a man of austere [[piety]] and fervent zeal. From the standpoint of the Dominican idea of the supreme necessity of maintaining ecclesiastical discipline, he defended the rights of the papacy and proclaimed that the pope should be "the mirror of God on earth."{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

==Modern assessment==
In the mid-twentieth century, Cajetan's thought came to be assessed negatively by certain Catholic commentators who, in reacting against the then-regnant [[neo-Thomist]] thought, portrayed Cajetan as the first person to make mistaken interpretations of the thought of [[Thomas Aquinas]] - interpretations which, in their (different) narratives, lingered into the twentieth century.

For [[Étienne Gilson]], who was responding to arguments that 'philosophy' and 'Christianity' were incompatible disciplines, there existed in Hellenistic Judaism, patristic thought and the medieval period a way of thinking, animated by the ancient Greek quest for the cause of being, which could rightly be called 'Christian philosophy'. In Gilson's account, it was in Cajetan's thought that this link was first broken, since Cajetan, contaminated by [[Scotism]], reduced [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s metaphysics of the existential act of being to an ontology of substance. Cajetan and his successors therefore, in Gilson's account, represented Thomas as focused on the forms and essences of beings only, and not on the existence of all things as participation in the pure actuality which is God. Accordingly, for Gilson, 'philosophy' and 'Christianity' are only incompatible if Christian thought is understood in its tradition post-Cajetan - a tradition which is worse than the older, more distinguished tradition of Christian thought.&lt;ref&gt;F Kerr, ''After Aquinas'', (2002), pp80-3&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Henri de Lubac]], who in ''[[Surnaturel]] ''(1946) was trying to provide a historical account of what he saw the emergence of a mistaken reading of the relationship between the natural and supernatural in Thomas Aquinas, it was Cajetan who made the misinterpretation which had affected all subsequent interpretation of Thomas Aquinas. Cajetan, de Lubac argued, assumed that Thomas was an Aristotelian, working with a definition of nature from Aristotle's ''Physics'', which effectively turned human nature into a reality essentially closed in on itself, with its own intrinsic powers, desires and goals. This move, argued de Lubac, led subsequent Catholic thought to produce mistaken readings of Thomas Aquinas's account of the relationship between nature and grace.&lt;ref&gt; F Kerr, ''After Aquinas'', (2002), p136&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Ralph McInerny]] and other scholars have challenged the negative assessment of Cajetan's work made by Lubac and Gilson. McInerny writes that the criticisms of Cajetan are not in fact supported by evidence from his works, and furthermore that it is not Cajetan but Gilson whose interpretation of Aquinas is a departure from the latter's own beliefs.&lt;ref&gt; McInerny, Ralph, "Preambula Fidei; Thomas Aquinas and the God of the Philosophers"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hipp hipp hurra! Konstnärsfest på Skagen - Peder Severin Krøyer.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Hip, Hip, Hurrah!]]'' by Danish painter [[P.S. Krøyer]], 1888]]
A '''toast''' is a ritual in which a drink is taken as an expression of '''honor''' or '''goodwill'''. The term may be applied to the person or thing so honored, the drink taken, or the verbal expression accompanying the drink. Thus, a person could be "the toast of the evening", for whom someone "proposes a toast" to congratulate and for whom a third person "toasts" in agreement. The ritual forms the basis of the literary and performance genre, of which Mark Twain's "To the Babies" is a well-known example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etext.virginia.edu/railton/onstage/babies.html |title=Toast: The Babies |publisher=Etext.virginia.edu |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The toast as described here is rooted in [[Western culture]], but certain cultures outside that [[Cultural area|sphere]] have their own traditions in which consuming a drink is connected with ideas of celebration and honor. While the physical and verbal ritual of the toast may be elaborate and formal, merely raising one's glass towards someone or something and then drinking is essentially a toast as well, the message being one of goodwill towards the person or thing indicated.

==History==
According to various apocryphal stories, the custom of touching glasses evolved from concerns about poisoning. By one account, clinking glasses together would cause each drink to spill over into the others' (though there is no real evidence for such an origin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/food/rituals/clink.asp |title=Why We Clink Wine Glasses |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to other stories, the word ''toast'' became associated with the custom in the 17th century, based on a custom of flavoring drinks with spiced [[toast]]. The word originally referred to the lady in whose honor the drink was proposed, her name being seen as figuratively flavoring the drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=toast |work=Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1) |publisher=Random House, Inc |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/toast |accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=toast |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |year=2001 |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=toast&amp;searchmode=term |accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--should really cite a more authoritative source directly, but for the lack of anything better these indirect citations ought to do--&gt; The ''International Handbook on Alcohol and Culture'' says toasting "is probably a secular vestige of ancient sacrificial [[libation]]s in which a sacred liquid was offered to the gods: blood or wine in exchange for a wish, a prayer summarized in the words 'long life!' or 'to your health!{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztzcZbRaKXsC&amp;dq=International+Handbook+on+Alcohol+and+Culture&amp;pg=PP1#PPA81,M1 |title=International Handbook on Alcohol and Culture - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 1995-01-01|accessdate=2012-04-16|isbn=9780313252341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canon Press]], 2007 p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol for toasting at weddings is comparatively elaborate and fixed. At a [[wedding reception]], the [[Wedding ceremony participants|father of the bride]], in his role as host, regularly offers the first toast, thanking the guests for attending, offering tasteful remembrances of the bride's childhood, and wishing the newlyweds a happy life together. The [[Wedding ceremony participants|best man]] usually proposes a toast in the form of best wishes and congratulations to the newlyweds. A best man's toast takes the form of a short speech (3–5 minutes) that combines a mixture of humor and sincerity.&lt;ref name="weddingcongratulations"&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.weddingcongratulations.org/congratulations |title=Wedding Congratulations |publisher=Wedding Congratulations |date=2012-02-09 |accessdate=2012-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507095100/http://www.weddingcongratulations.org/congratulations/ |archivedate=2012-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The humor often comes in the shape of the best man telling jokes at the groom's expense whilst the sincerity incorporates the praise and complimentary comments that a best man should make about the bride and groom, amongst others. The actual "toast" is then delivered at the end of the speech and is a short phrase wishing the newlyweds a happy, healthy, loving life together. The [[maid of honor]] may follow suit, appropriately tailoring her comments to the bride. The groom may offer the final toast, thanking the bride's parents for hosting the wedding, the wedding party for their participation, and finally dedicating the toast to the bridesmaids.&lt;ref name="toastchampagne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toastchampagne.co.uk/facts/toasting.php |title=Toasting &amp;#124; |publisher=Toastchampagne.co.uk |date=1911-05-31 |accessdate=2012-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725082717/http://www.toastchampagne.co.uk/facts/toasting.php |archivedate=2008-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical traditional wedding toasts include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weddings.about.com/od/theweddingparty/a/toastsamples_2.htm |title=More Samples of Wedding Toasts |publisher=Weddings.about.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|(to the couple)&lt;br&gt;Here's to your coffins&lt;br&gt;May they be made of hundred-year-old oaks&lt;br&gt;Which we shall plant tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;May you both live as long as you want, and never want as long as you live&lt;br&gt;May the best of your yesterdays be the worst of your tomorrows.

(to the bride)&lt;br&gt;May I see you grey&lt;br&gt;And combing your grandchildren's hair.}}

Toasts are also offered on patriotic occasions, as in the case of [[Stephen Decatur]]'s famous "Our country! In our intercourse with foreign nations may we always be in the right; but our country, right or wrong." Equally traditional are satiric verses:
{{quote|Here's to dear old Boston,&lt;br&gt;The home of the bean and the cod,&lt;br&gt;Where Lowells speak only to Cabots,&lt;br&gt;And Cabots speak only to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/3585589/Home-of-the-bean-and-the-cod.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Home of the bean and the cod |date=2002-12-22 |accessdate=2010-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806002501/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/3585589/Home-of-the-bean-and-the-cod.html |archivedate=August 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Norms and etiquette of toasting==
[[Image:Bride's toast.jpg|right|thumb|A bride offering a toast at a wedding]]
Toasts may be solemn, sentimental, humorous, bawdy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.folklore.ms/html/recitations/short_recitations/toasts/bawdy_toasts/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722222051/http://www.folklore.ms/html/recitations/short_recitations/toasts/bawdy_toasts/index.htm |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or insulting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.folklore.ms/html/recitations/short_recitations/toasts/toasts_insulting.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722222055/http://www.folklore.ms/html/recitations/short_recitations/toasts/toasts_insulting.htm |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of announcing one's intention to make a toast and signalling for quiet by rapping on the wineglass, while common, is regarded by some authorities as rude.&lt;ref name="toastchampagne"/&gt; Except in very small and informal gatherings, a toast is offered standing. At a gathering, none should offer a toast to the guest of honor until the host has had the opportunity to do so. In English-speaking countries, guests may signal their approval of the toast by saying "hear hear".&lt;ref name="air force dining"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jmarprotocol.com/helpfiles/air_force_dining.asp |title=Air Force Dining |publisher=Jmarprotocol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person honored should neither stand nor drink,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Goose45 |url=http://www.intowine.com/wine-toasts2.html |title=A Guide To Toasting |publisher=Into Wine |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after the toast should rise to thank the one who has offered the toast and take a drink, perhaps but not necessarily offering a toast in turn. As toasts may occur in long series, experienced attendees often make sure to leave enough wine in the glass to allow participation in numerous toasts.&lt;ref name="hmsrichmond"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmsrichmond.org/toast.htm |title=Royal Navy Toast |publisher=Hmsrichmond.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putting one's glass down before the toast is complete, or simply holding one's glass without drinking is widely regarded as impolite, suggesting that one does not share the benevolent sentiments expressed in the toast, nor the unity and fellowship implicit in toasting itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bkthedj.com/wedding/wedding_traditions_history.php |title=Wedding Tradition History, Customs, Etiquette |publisher=Bkthedj.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the non-drinker is counseled not to refuse to allow wine to be poured for a toast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradley.edu/campusorg/pct/Test%20Your%20Business%20Etiquette.doc |title=Test Your Business Etiquette |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614052513/http://www.bradley.edu/campusorg/pct/Test%20Your%20Business%20Etiquette.doc |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inverting the glass is especially discouraged.&lt;ref name="Sih98"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://kansascity.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/1998/02/02/smallb2.html |first=Melinda |last=Sih |title=Minding manners at dinner serves you well in business |date=1998-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toasting traditionally involves [[alcoholic beverage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web |url=http://www.epicweddingphoto.com/toasting-traditions |title=Can you toast with non-alcoholic drinks? |date=April 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt; [[Champagne]] (or at least some variety of [[sparkling wine]]) is regarded as especially festive and is widely associated with [[New Year's Eve]] and other celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert J Douglas |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/335/7633/1281 |title=Champagne: the safer choice for celebrations |publisher=BMJ |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people nowadays substitute sparkling fruit juice (often packaged in champagne-style bottles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cincinnatisparklingjuices.com/ |title=Juice - Sparkling Juice - Meier's Wine Cellars Inc - Cincinnati - Ohio |location=39.1953; -84.4006 |publisher=Cincinnatisparklingjuices.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302154332/http://www.cincinnatisparklingjuices.com/ |archivedate=2012-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and many authorities consider it perfectly acceptable to participate in a toast while drinking water.&lt;ref name="Sih98"/&gt; Toasting with an empty glass may be viewed by some as acceptable behavior for the non-drinker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19921230&amp;id=824VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gOoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5496,6944063|title=Eugene Register-Guard - Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though feigning to drink from such a glass would likely be seen as ridiculous.  The person giving the toast should never do so with an empty glass, even if the glass contains nothing more than water.

Teetotalers may view the drinking of toasts to be abominable and incompatible with their stand, as witnessed by this narrative from ''The Teetotaler'' (1840):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
At the anniversary of Cheshunt College, [[Sir Culling Eardley, 3rd Baronet|Sir Culling Eardley Smith]] was in the chair. This gentleman, after dinner, said "he had subscribed to the Teetotal Pledge, which of course was incompatible with the drinking of toasts;" when the Rev. J. Blackburn, (minister of Claremont Chapel, Pentonville,) said "he was not a teetotaler,—''he was not in bondage,''&lt;ref&gt;[[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 5:1 -¶ "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage." (KJV)&lt;/ref&gt;—and on that subject he had very recently been preaching."  What could the Rev. Gentleman mean by this, but that he had recently been preaching against Teetotalism?  Let the Rev. Gentleman look at drinking customs and their enormous evils, and ask himself if he has done his duty; or whether he expects to be pronounced "a [[Parable of the talents or minas|good an faithful servant]]", if he continues even from the pulpit to encourage the great damning evil of this nation. Mr. Donaldson said that he was happy to add, that one of the most popular ministers of the day, the Rev. J. Sherman, gave Mr. B. a pretty severe and well-merited reply, by saying, "His brother Blackburn had said, he (Mr. B.) was not in bondage; he must be allowed to say, that he rejoiced that he (Mr. S.) had been enabled to break through the old and stupid custom of washing down sentiments by draughts of intoxicating liquors. ''He had thus become a free man.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Second Epistle of Peter|2 Peter]] 2:19 - "While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage." (KJV)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Donaldson concluded with some very severe animadversions upon the infamous conduct of Mr. Blackburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date= 1840-07-25 |title= The Teetotaler |volume= I |issue= 5 |page= 38 |location= [[London]] |publisher= United Temperance Association |editor1-first= George W.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is a superstition in the [[United States Navy]] that a toast is never to be made with water, since the person so honored will be doomed to a watery grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=chicago_blogger |url=http://thewinehistorian.blogspot.com/2009/11/raditional-us-navy-wine-toast.html |title=The Wine Historian: A Traditional US Navy Wine Toast |publisher=Thewinehistorian.blogspot.com |date=2009-11-28 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a [[United States Air Force]] [[Dining in|Dining In]], all toasts are traditionally made with wine except for the final toast of the night made in honor of [[Prisoner of war|POWs]]/[[Missing in action|MIAs]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforcewives.com/index.php/content/view/1125/342/ |title=MilitaryWives.com Network |publisher=Airforcewives.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; because these honorees did not have the luxury of wine while in captivity, the toast is made with water. Some versions of the protocol prescribe a toast in water for all deceased comrades.&lt;ref name="air force dining"/&gt;

It is or was the custom on the (British) [[Royal Navy]] to drink toasts sitting, because in old-type wooden warships below decks there was not enough [[Vertical clearance|headroom]] to stand upright.

==The German word "prost"==
[[File:Prost oktoberfest.jpg|right|thumb|Toasting at [[Oktoberfest]]]]
=== Prosit/Prost ===
Prosit is a [[Latin]] word from which the German short form "prost" is derived. It is a [[toast]], that is an acclamation made before drinking an alcoholic beverage when drinkers chink glasses. The expression dates back to the beginning of the 18th century when it was used among university students and eventually made its way into every day language. In a ceremonious context and in connection with a short speech, the English word [[toast]] may also be used.

=== Origin of the word ===
The word is, as mentioned above, of Latin origin and it comes from the verb "prodesse" (= "to benefit sth/sb", "to be beneficial"). Consequently, "prosit" is the [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] form (3rd person Singular, Present Subjunctive, Active) and therefore an [[optative]]: "To you/ to your health". Like the colloquial "prost", "prosit" was originally used by university students.&lt;ref&gt;Prosit, colloquial prost in DUDEN, German Monolingual Dictionary Online&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Usage ===
In German, [[synonyms]] like "Wohl bekomm's!", "Zum Wohl!", and many versions from other languages may also be used instead of "prosit". The acclamation itself is also referred to as a "prosit". The verb form is "zuprosten", where the prefix "zu" means that the speech act is targeted at one or several people.

In the [[Swabian dialect]], the word has the further meaning of a [[belch]], called a "Prositle". The acclamation is followed by the clinking of glasses, often linked to other rules like making eye contact. This ritual is commonly attributed to a medieval custom, whereby one could avoid being poisoned by one's drinking companions, as a few drops of each beverage got mixed when clinking glasses. There is every likelihood that this did not work. It was much more effective for one table to share one or more drinking vessels, a procedure which was common for a long time.

In Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian, prosit is a blessing used in response to a sneeze, in the same way the English expression "bless you" is used.

In [[Germany]], toasting, not necessarily by words but usually just by touching each other's drinking vessels, is usually a very closely observed part of culture. In private company, no one should drink a sip of alcohol before having toasted all the other people at the table. In doing this, it is very important to look directly into the other drinker's eyes. Not practising this is considered rude and often, humorously, believed to attract all kinds of bad luck (e.g. "seven years of bad luck" and the like).

==Traditional toasts==
In the British Royal Navy, the officers' noon mess typically began with the [[loyal toast]], followed by a toast distinctive for the day of the week:
* Monday: Our ships at sea.
* Tuesday: Our sailors (formerly Our men but changed to include women).&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23013395 | work=BBC News | title='Our wives and sweethearts' Naval toast rewritten | date=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wednesday: Ourselves. ("As no-one else is likely to concern themselves with our welfare" is often the retort and not part of the toast)
* Thursday: A bloody war or a sickly season (meaning the desire and likelihood of being promoted when many people die: during war or sickness.)
* Friday: A willing foe and sea room. (meaning the payment of prize money after a successful engagement)
* Saturday: Our families (formerly Our wives and sweethearts with the retort of "may they never meet").&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;
* Sunday: Absent friends.

The sequence was also prescribed in at least one publication for the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;US Navy's "Mess Night Manual", Naval School, Civil Engineer Corps Officers, Port Hueneme, California, August 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

A toast might be spontaneous and free-form, a carefully planned original speech, or a recitation of traditional sentiments such as this Irish example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talesoftanglewood.blogspot.com/2008/07/irish-sayings-blessings-toasts.html |title=The Tales of Tanglewood: Irish Sayings, Blessings &amp; Toasts |publisher=Talesoftanglewood.blogspot.com |date=2008-07-07 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|May the road rise to meet you.&lt;br&gt;May the wind be always at your back.&lt;br&gt;May the sun shine warm upon your face.&lt;br&gt;And rains fall soft upon your fields.&lt;br&gt;And until we meet again,&lt;br&gt;May God hold you in the hollow of His hand.}}

An informal variation of the last 2 lines is:

{{quote|"And may ye be in Heaven a half-hour&lt;br&gt;afore the devil knows ye're dead!"}}

==Toasts Worldwide==
In various cultures worldwide, toasting is common and to not do so may be a breach of etiquette. The general theme of a toast is "good luck" or "good health". At formal meals in certain countries of the Commonwealth of Nations, the first toast to be proposed is traditionally the [[Loyal toast|Loyal Toast]] ("[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|The Queen]]"). This may be adapted in other countries to give a loyal toast to the appropriate [[Head of State]].&lt;ref name="hmsrichmond"/&gt;

The '''School of Divinity''' at [[Yale University]], in [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], is one of twelve graduate or professional schools within Yale University.

[[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] theological education was the motivation at the founding of Yale, and the professional school has its roots in a Theological Department established in 1822. The school had maintained its own campus, faculty, and degree program since 1869, and it has become more ecumenical beginning in the mid-19th century. Since the 1970s, it has been affiliated with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] [[Berkeley Divinity School]] and has housed the [[Yale Institute of Sacred Music|Institute of Sacred Music]], which offers separate degree programs. In July 2017, a two-year process of formal affiliation was completed, with the addition of [[Andover Newton Seminary at Yale Divinity School|Andover Newton Seminary]] joining the school.

==History==
[[File:Divinity College at Yale before 1870, Memories of Yale life and men, 1854-1899 (1903).jpg|thumb|200px|The Divinity College dormitory on the [[Old Campus (Yale University)|Old Campus]], completed in 1836]]
Theological education was the earliest academic purpose of Yale University. When [[Yale College]] was founded in 1701, it was as a college of religious training for [[Congregationalist]] ministers in [[Connecticut Colony]], designated in its charter as a school "wherein Youth may be instructed in the Arts &amp; Sciences who through the blessing of Almighty God may be fitted for Publick employment both in Church &amp; Civil State."  A professorship of divinity was established in 1746. In 1817, the occupant of the divinity chair, [[Eleazar Thompson Fitch]], supported a student request to endow a theological curriculum, and five years later a separate {{nowrap|'''Yale Theological Seminary'''}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=History of Higher Education Annual: 1997 |p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=vgQaGJt9OTQC&amp;pg=PA94 94] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; was founded by the [[Yale Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Catalogue"&gt;{{cite book |title=A General Catalogue of the Divinity School of Yale College: A Brief Biographical Record of Its Members in The First Half Century of Its Existence as A Distinct Department |publisher=Tuttle, Morehouse, &amp; Taylor |year=1873 |location=New Haven}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same motion, [[Second Great Awakening]] theologian [[Nathaniel William Taylor]] was appointed to become the first Dwight Professor of Didactic Theology.&lt;ref name="YUL"&gt;{{cite web |title=Yale Divinity School Milestones, 1822-2012 |publisher=Yale University Library |date=23 October 2012 |url=http://divinity-adhoc.library.yale.edu/Exhibits/YDSMilestones.htm |accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor was considered the "central figure" in the school's founding, and he was joined in 1826 by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs, Sr.]], a scholar of sacred languages and lexicographer [[Chauncey A. Goodrich]] in 1839.&lt;ref name="YUL"/&gt; A dedicated student dormitory, Divinity College, was completed on the college's [[Old Campus (Yale University)|Old Campus]] in 1836, but the department had no permanent classrooms or offices until several years after the end of the [[American Civil War]]. 

[[File:Old Divinity School, Yale University, New Haven, Conn.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Divinity Hall, occupied from 1870 to 1931, viewed from the [[New Haven Green]].]]
After a significant period of enrollment decline, the school began fundraising from alumni for new faculty and facilities.&lt;ref name="YUL"/&gt; Divinity Hall was constructed on the present-day site of [[Calhoun College|Grace Hopper College]] between 1869 and 1871, featuring two classroom wings, a chapel.&lt;ref name="YUL"/&gt;  Around the time of the new campus' construction came the arrival of new faculty, including [[James M. Hoppin]], [[George Edward Day (language scholar)|George Edward Day]], [[George Park Fisher]], and [[Leonard Bacon]].&lt;ref name="YUL"/&gt; The first Bachelor of Divinity (B.D.) was conferred in 1867, and the department became a separate School of Divinity in 1869.&lt;ref name="Catalogue"/&gt; The school remained across from Old Campus until 1929, when a new campus was constructed on the northern edge of the university campus, at the top of [[Prospect Hill, New Haven|Prospect Hill]].

[[Berkeley Divinity School]] affiliated with Yale Divinity School in 1971, and in the same year the university replaced the B.D. with a [[Master of Divinity]] program.  While Berkeley retains its [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] connection, its students are admitted by and fully enrolled as members of Yale Divinity School. [[The Jonathan Edwards Center at Yale University]], a division of the Divinity School, maintains a large collection of primary source materials about [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], a 1720 Yale alumnus. The Yale Institute of Sacred Music (ISM) is jointly-affiliated with the Divinity School and School of Music. It offers programs in choral conducting, organ performance, voice, and church music studies, and in liturgical studies and religion and the arts.

In May 2016, [[Andover Newton Theological School]] president Martin Copenhaver announced that Andover Newton would begin a process of formal affiliation with the Divinity School over the next two years. In the 2016–17 academic year, a cohort of faculty relocated to New Haven teaching students and launching pilot initiatives focused on congregational ministry education, while Andover Newton continued to operate in Massachusetts over the next two years. In July 2017, a formal affiliation was signed, resulting in smaller Andover Newton functioning as a unit within Yale Divinity School, similar to its arrangement with Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://divinity.yale.edu/news/yds-and-andover-newton-sign-historic-agreement|title=YDS and Andover Newton sign historic agreement|last=|first=|date=July 20, 2017|website=Yale Divinity School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[File:Yale Divinity School Highsmith.jpg|thumb|Sterling Divinity Quadrangle, campus of the Yale Divinity School]]
When the department was organized as a school in 1869, it was moved to a campus across from the northwest corner of the [[New Haven Green]] composed of East Divinity Hall (1869), Marquand Chapel (1871), West Divinity Hall (1871), and the Trowbridge Library (1881). The buildings, designed by [[Richard Morris Hunt]], were demolished under the [[residential colleges of Yale University|residential college plan]] and replaced by [[Calhoun College|Calhoun College, now known as Grace Hopper College]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/01_03/popup/landmarks/12.html Yale's Lost Landmarks: Divinity Hall, Yale Alumni Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, the trustees of the estate of lawyer [[John William Sterling]] agreed that a portion of his bequest to Yale would be used to build a new campus for the Divinity School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bedford |first=Steven |title=John Russell Popoe: Architect of Empire |publisher=Random House |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn= 9780847820863 |pages=166–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sterling Divinity Quadrangle, completed in 1932, is a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-style complex built at the top of [[Prospect Hill (New Haven)|Prospect Hill]]. It was designed by [[Delano &amp; Aldrich]] and modeled in part on the [[University of Virginia]].

A $49-million renovation of Sterling Divinity Quadrangle was completed in 2003.

The '''Zen Peacemakers''' is a diverse network of [[Engaged Buddhism|socially engaged Buddhists]], currently including the formal structures of the Zen Peacemakers International&lt;ref&gt;www.zenpeacemakers.org&lt;/ref&gt;, the Zen Peacemaker Order and the Zen Peacemaker Circles&lt;ref&gt;http://ukzenpeacemaker.blogspot.com&lt;/ref&gt;, many affiliated individuals and groups, and communities formed by Dharma Successors of Roshi [[Bernie Glassman]]. It was founded by [[Bernie Glassman]] and his wife Sandra Jishu Holmes in 1996, as a means of continuing the work begun with the [[Greyston Foundation]] in 1980 of expanding [[Zen]] practice into larger spheres of influence such as [[social services]], [[business]] and [[ecology]] but with a greater emphasis on peace work. Zen Peacemakers has developed from the [[White Plum Asanga]] lineage of [[Taizan Maezumi]].

==Tradition and lineage==
Although Zen Peacemakers is associated with the [[White Plum Asanga]] lineage, founder [[Bernie Glassman]] did not envisage it as an organisation bound by traditional Japanese [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] practice. Bernie Glassman has said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Maezumi Roshi was not carrying out the tradition of the Japanese Soto sect when he came here. The Soto sect of Japan was not carrying out the traditions of Chinese Zen. You have to be careful with the word 'traditional.' We honor a lot of eccentric people." &lt;ref name="ShamSun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1492&amp;Itemid=0|title=White Plums and Lizard Tails: The Story of Maezumi Roshi and his American Lineage|last=Jones|first=Noa|publisher=Shambhala Sun|accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Likewise, although within the [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]], the Zen Peacemaker Order was not formed as part of the [[White Plum Asanga]] organisation. Links between the two organisations are now distant; despite being named as heir to the presidency of the [[White Plum Asanga]] in Maezumi's will, Glassman ceased attending the annual meetings of [[Taizan Maezumi]]'s [[dharma transmission|dharma heirs]] within a few years of his former teacher's death.&lt;ref name="ShamSun"/&gt; According to author [[James Ishmael Ford]], as of 2006 Glassman has "transferred his leadership of the [[White Plum Asanga]] to his Dharma brother [[Dennis Genpo Merzel|Merzel Roshi]] and has formally 'disrobed,' renouncing priesthood in favor of serving as a lay teacher and leader of what is now called the Zen Peacemaker Family."

==Greyston Foundation==
Activities of the Zen Peacemakers originated in [[Yonkers, New York]] with the opening of the [[Greyston Bakery]], its most well-known and prosperous project, in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Greyston Family Inn opened in 1991, on proceeds from the sale of Greyston mansion. It provides permanent housing for [[homeless]] people, with a child day-care center amongst services available for residents. Currently there are three buildings, providing fifty housing units. Other projects include the Greyston Garden Project, five community-run gardens established on neglected properties. In 1992 Greyston Health Services was formed, primarily to provide services for poor people with [[HIV/AIDS]]. In 1997 Issan House opened, named after [[Issan Dorsey]] a [[Zen]] [[Rōshi|Roshi]] who had died from an AIDS-related condition in 1990. It provides thirty-five permanent housing units for people living with both HIV/AIDS and mental illness or chemical dependency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knowledgeplex.org/showdoc.html?id=163263. KnowledgePlex: Issan House Supportive Housing Case Study-2004 MetLife Foundation Awards, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; The Maitri Day Program within the building provides a variety of health and rehabilitative service to 150 people with HIV/AIDS from the local community. As one of the first '[[welfare to work]]' programs in the USA, in 2004 Greyston had an annual budget of over $20 million and received numerous government grants.  At Yonkers, they occupy the former [[Ethan Flagg House-Blessed Sacrament Monastery]], added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International==
In 1996 [[Bernie Glassman]] - with his wife Sandra Jishu Holmes - officially founded the Zen Peacemaker Order, later the '''Zen Peacemaker Circle''' and currently '''Zen Peacemakers'''. According to professor Christopher S. Queen, "The order is based on three principles: plunging into the unknown, bearing witness to the pain and joy of the world and a commitment to heal oneself and the world."&lt;ref name="Queen 2000"&gt;{{cite book| last =Queen| first =Christopher S| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Engaged Buddhism in the West| publisher =Wisdom publications| year =2000| location =| pages =| url =http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41951145&amp;referer=one_hit| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-86171-159-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Zen Peacemaker projects have included a Paris soup kitchen for immigrants and non-violence efforts in the Palestinian territories, with joint Israeli-Palestinian peaceful coexistence projects in Israel. Zen Peacemakers in Poland established 'Nonviolent Communications Training and Practice' in the national public school system and opened an AIDS hospice. The [[Auschwitz]] project brought together families of [[the Holocaust]] survivors and the descendants of those who ran the camps to '"bear witness to the horrors of war" during retreats at the site of the former German concentration camp in Poland.&lt;ref name="garfinkel"&gt;{{cite book |author=Perry Garfinkel |coauthors= |title=Buddha or Bust |year=2006 |publisher=Harmony Books |pages=34–35 |isbn=978-1-4000-8217-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, Zen Peacemakers have campaigned for [[prison reform]], provided [[hospice]] care and worked with the poor in both inner city and rural areas.&lt;ref name="ZPHISTORY"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zen Peacemaker History |url=http://www.zenpeacemakers.org/about/history |accessdate=2007-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417043303/http://www.zenpeacemakers.org/about/history/ |archivedate=April 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zen Peacemakers has 70 affiliate centers in 5 Continents and 12 Countries. Countries with groups affiliated to Zen Peacemakers include: Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK. In the United States affiliates include the [[Upaya Institute and Zen Center]] led by [[Joan Halifax]] in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

==Elders and Spiritual Directors==
The founder roshi [[Bernie Glassman]] has served as the spiritual director of Zen Peacemakers from its inception. In May 2005 roshi [[Enkyo Pat O'Hara]] was ratified as Co-Spiritual Director by the Zen Peacemaker Board. Rami Efal serves as director of the Zen Peacemakers International organisation, acting as a 'hive' to collect and share ideas for the widespread community. In Europe, Cornelius Collande, Barbara Wegmueller, Michel DuBois and Frank De Waele are among the elders of the Zen Peacemakers community and the Auschwitz Bearing Witness retreat. For the Zen Peacemaker Circles, the current coordinator in Europe is Kathleen Battke, who succeeded Barbara Wegmueller in the role, and in America the longest serving elder in Circle practice is Jeana Moore.

==Zen Peacemaker Sangha==
The structure of Zen Peacemakers is, like the Greyston Foundation, somewhat complex and also like Greyston is described as a mandala. The mandala is based on the [[Five Buddha Families]] with the intention that the organisation addresses needs in all aspects of life. The Zen Peacemakers Sangha (ZPS) is a branch of the Zen Peacemakers Order. It is an association of groups founded by or led by seniors empowered by Bernie Glassman or groups who practice Zen and socially engaged Zen. The ZPS is a forum for sharing the diverse methods of practice, service and teaching within the Zen Peacemakers Order for the purpose of education and  personal development as practitioners and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==The Mother House==
Formerly sited in Montague, Massachusetts, in the United States, the Mother House was the study and practice center of the Zen Peacemakers. The approach of the institute is based on the Japanese concept ''{{transl|ja|gyogaku funi}}'', or "practice and study are not two".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDP/is_2006_Jan_2/ai_n15991064/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1|title=Master fuses Zen, Western concepts to draw Japanese to new institute|date=2006-01-02|publisher=Asian Economic News|accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides various training paths, study programs, and hands-on internships.  The Mother House hosted various programs including the Montague Farm Zendo, the Montague Farm Zen House and a residence program.

The Mother House was foreclosed on in 2011 and sold to a private owner in 2012.

==Training and Spiritual practices==
The training of the Zen Peacemakers is grounded in traditional Zen practice - meditation, retreats, liturgy, personal study-relationships with empowered teachers - and also explores new forms and structures. [[Council circle]], [[Nonviolent Communication]], international Bearing Witness retreats, and "plunges" - immersing oneself in unfamiliar situations, often connected with social action, which require the participant to let go of what they know and respond in new ways - have come to form core elements of the training throughout the network of practitioners. Glassman trained in clowning as a personal plunge, visiting war zones and performing for the children. In his later years, Glassman disrobed from the priesthood to develop lay zen practice, following the tradition of his heart teacher Koryu Osaka Roshi. Together with his wife Eve Marko, he empowered lay zen preceptors, and Eve Marko worked on a new set of "householder koans". Lay and circle forms of liturgy such as the Gate of Sweet Nectar, Glassman's translation and elaboration of the traditional Japanese Kanromon ceremony of feeding the hungry ghosts, came to be explored and shared with the community. At the heart of the Zen Peacemakers approach is the conviction that service and social action are themselves zen practice, together with the challenge to develop new 'upayas' (tools) to meet each new situation.

Formulations of spiritual principles specific to the order include "The Sixteen Practices of a Zen Peacemaker", comprising the "Three Refuges", the "Three Tenets" and the "Ten Practices" of a Zen Peacemaker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Zen Peacemaker Circles ==

{{quote
|text= A few years later, we formed something called Peacemaker Circle International, dedicated to creating networks of spiritually based social activists. Not just networks, but coalitions. And not just coalitions, but circles. We had done a lot of direct service – building homes, taking care of kids, taking care of the sick, creating jobs for people. What we noticed is that if we just did this one thing, each of us could only do so much. Even if each of us did a wonderful job, it was still just that one job. Now, how do you take care of the poor? How do you take care of people who have AIDS in Africa when all you can do is just one job? So you need to change the game. Instead of always competing with everybody for money or recognition and all of the politics that NGOs and not-for-profits engage in, why don’t we spend some of that energy to start linking – linking and creating a real force for social action that’s made up of all of us working together.

If somebody says, “What is Buddhist about this?” I would ask, “How do you define Buddhism?” If it’s about awakening to the oneness of life, then this is a real way to do it. Working together is a wonderful way to wake up to this oneness. So we started bringing this work to different countries. We started in Europe. Then we went to the Middle East. And then we started in Latin America… We introduced this model of organising interlocking circles and began planning how these different groups could work to help each other, instead of working separately.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Marko, in ''Women Practicing Buddhism: American Experiences'' by Peter Gregory and Susanne Mrozik (1998, Wisdom Books US), p114&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, [[Bernie Glassman]] worked with circles of students around the world to develop a consensus-based model for social action and interfaith spiritual practice. Initially called Peacemaker Circle International, they later became known as [http://www.peacemakercircles.org Zen Peacemaker Circles]. The interfaith strand of the Zen Peacemakers was influenced by [[Bernie Glassman]]'s friendship with Sufi teacher and radio host [[Lex Hixon]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AljMemDWzEc&amp;t=2s&lt;/ref&gt;, his appreciation of the Jewish renewal leader Rabbi [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]], and his many Christian zen students and successors. Zen Peacemaker Circles were established globally, presenting a model of zen practice that replaced the traditional role of 'Zen teacher' with innovative communities of practitioners learning from each other and sharing ideas between Circles. Decision making used the approach of [[Sociocracy]], and [[Bernie Glassman]] created two new community roles of Steward and Circle Dharmaholder to support the model. The 'circular transmission' experiment was largely abandoned after the loss of the Mother House in 2011, although Zen Peacemaker Circle training continues in the UK&lt;ref&gt;http://ukzenpeacemakers.blogspot.com&lt;/ref&gt;, Germany and the US. In other communities, the tools of Circle practice, especially [[Council circle]] have been incorporated into traditional zen training, to give a voice to students&lt;ref&gt;http://imagine.sfzc.org/council/&lt;/ref&gt;, for social action&lt;ref&gt;https://upaya.org/uploads/pdfs/thesisfinaldraft.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and for governance&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zlmc.org/governance/&lt;/ref&gt;

|text=Dharma teachers are often schooled in the dharma, in delivery, but not in community decision making. Traditionally organizations have been run on a hierarchical model, with one or two people making all the decisions. How inspiring to have processes that can engage entire groups. The circles of decision makers are an image of interdependence. Interdependence should be reflected in the organization of organizations. How to continue to realize and express the project of interdependence? The inherent interconnectedness of all life.&lt;ref&gt;https://michaelstoneteaching.com/2014/10/11/bernie-glassman-2-the-circles-are-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Street Retreats ==

'Street retreats', excursions by [[Bernie Glassman]] and others into the streets for days at a time to live amongst the homeless, have become a feature of Zen Peacemaker practice.&lt;ref name="Queen 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="garfinkel"/&gt; Author [[James Ishmael Ford]] writes, "...'street retreats,' for instance, moves [[sesshin]] into the streets: participants eat in [[soup kitchen]]s, and, if they know they're not displacing homeless people, sleep in homeless shelters or, otherwise, sleep in public places. [[Zazen]] takes place in parks and [[dokusan]] in alleys."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Ford| first =James Ishmael| authorlink =James Ishmael Ford| coauthors =| title =Zen Master Who?: A Guide to the People and Stories of Zen| publisher =Wisdom Publications| year =2006| location =| pages =| url =http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70174891&amp;referer=one_hit| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-86171-509-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Socially Engaged Buddhism==
As a leader of [[Socially Engaged Buddhism]], the Zen Peacemakers publish ''Bearing Witness'', a free monthly online newsletter.  The socially engaged practices of Zen Peacemakers is aimed at extending [[Dharma]] beyond the [[Meditation Hall|meditation hall]] to the worlds of business, social services, conflict resolution and environmental stewardship. Socially Engaged Buddhism has frequently led to new models of practice, allowing Buddhists to addressing the needs of individuals and communities in disadvantaged areas. The Zen Peacemakers' way is intended to "illuminate all life as a boundless meditation hall".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Appraisal==
Religious historian Richard Hughes Seager writes "The Zen Peacemaker Order...has the potential to rival [[Thich Nhat Hanh]]'s groups and the [[Buddhist Peace Fellowship]] as a force in American activism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Seager| first =Richard Hughes| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Buddhism In America| publisher =Columbia University Press| year =1999| location =| pages = 209| url =http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40481142&amp;referer=one_hit| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-231-10868-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
